EL SALVADOR
Staff Report for the 2008 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2008 Consultation with El Salvador
Approved by David J. Robinson and Adnan Mazarei
October 29, 2008
Executive Summary
Discussions. The discussions were held in San Salvador during September 1–11. The mission met with Technical
Secretary of the Presidency Eduardo Ayala Grimaldi, Minister of Finance William Hándal, Central Bank President
Luz María Serpas de Portillo, other senior government officials, members of Congress, labor union representatives,
the private sector, think tanks, and the economic teams of the leading presidential candidates.
Staff team. The mission comprised A. Schipke (head), M. Albino-War, R. Cubero, and J. Prat (all WHD).
L. Cortavarría (MCM) and D. Desruelle joined the mission on September 8 and A. Umaña (OED) participated in the
final discussions.
Context. As a result of sustained economic reforms over the last couple of years, El Salvador’s macroeconomic
fundamentals are relatively solid. Like in other Central American countries, however, economic growth has
decelerated in recent months on the back of the U.S. slowdown and still high commodity prices. The global financial
turmoil and, possibly, electoral uncertainty, have led to some tightening in domestic financial conditions.
Key policy recommendations. Policies need to focus on crisis preparedness and structural reforms.
¾

Financial contingency measures. Monitor banks’ liquidity and their short- term borrowing closely, draw
up concrete action plans to deal with stress in the banking system, and negotiate contingent credit lines.

¾

Short-term fiscal policy. Maintain fiscal restraint and seek a political agreement to access long-term
financing from multilateral development banks (MDBs).

¾

Structural reforms. Further strengthen financial sector regulation and supervision and the sector’s ability
to confront shocks; reduce public debt to about 30 percent of GDP through tax revenue measures and cuts
in nonpriority spending; improve the efficiency and targeting of subsidies; and implement a parametric
reform of the pension system.

Authorities’ views. There was agreement between the authorities and staff on the policy challenges and on most of
the required measures.
2007 Surveillance Decision. The level of the real effective exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals and
standard competitiveness indicators suggest that the export sector remains competitive.

I. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
1.
As a result of sustained economic reforms, El Salvador’s macroeconomic
fundamentals are relatively solid. In 2007, the fiscal position improved, the public debt-toGDP ratio declined, and economic growth reached its highest level in a decade.
2.
Like in other Central American countries, however, economic growth has
decelerated in recent months on the back of the U.S. slowdown and still high commodity
prices. Growth in the monthly economic activity indicator has slowed to 3.6 percent in the
12 months to July. Demand has been squeezed by the increase in food and fuel prices. The
impact of the U.S. slowdown has also started to show: remittance growth has fallen to
4.4 percent in the 12 months to August and, while export growth (particularly from coffee,
maquila, and nontraditional sectors) has shown a marked upturn this year (accelerating to
16 percent y/y in August), it has started to falter in q/q terms. Moreover, imports have also
grown fast (16 percent in the year to August), driven by oil prices. The external current account
deficit widened to 5.5 percent of GDP in 2007, and reached 6 percent of 2008 GDP in the
12 months to June 2008.
3.
The rise in global commodity prices has
also generated substantial inflationary pressures.
Headline inflation increased from 4.9 percent (y/y) in
December 2007 to 8.7 percent in September. The
main contributor was food inflation, which rose from
6.5 percent to 14.3 percent during the same period.
Rising food prices are also considered to have been a
major factor behind the 4 percentage point increase
in the poverty rate in 2007 (to 35 percent), a
development likely to have worsened in 2008.
Several alternative measures of core inflation are
trending up, suggesting some transmission of
external price shocks to domestic prices, though
there is no clear sign of overheating or cyclical
demand pressures, in contrast to other countries in
the region.

4.
Political uncertainty and polarization have intensified in the run-up to the 2009
elections. Since the advent of democracy in the early 1990s, Salvadoran politics have remained
polarized between the two main parties—the governing ARENA and the FMLN. Over the past
few years, a split congress and a difficult political dialogue between the two parties have
effectively prevented passage of legislation requiring a two-thirds majority, including on longterm domestic and external financing. With congressional and presidential elections scheduled
for January and March 2009, respectively, the political focus has shifted to the elections. Even
though the FMLN candidate has been ahead in the polls since the start of the campaign, most
analysts expect the outcome of the presidential elections to be close.

4
5.
The global financial turmoil, and possibly, electoral uncertainty, have led to some
tightening in domestic financial conditions. The stock of bank deposits has stagnated
relative to end-2007, while deposit rates have increased slightly. Interbank repo rates have also
risen recently, reflecting tighter funding conditions, and banks have increased their external
borrowing, in part to build up liquidity. Credit growth has slowed down. The central
government has found it difficult to place its short-term debt instruments (especially those with
maturities beyond the presidential election) in local markets, despite the relatively solid fiscal
position. In mid-September, Standard & Poor’s revised down the outlook on El Salvador’s
sovereign debt rating from stable to negative (the rating itself was maintained at BB+), based
on the adverse impact of external shocks on growth, inflation, and the fiscal deficit, as well as
political uncertainty. However, sovereign spreads (after rising considerably in July) have
recently fluctuated in line with those of other Latin American emerging markets.
6.
The banking system—mainly foreign-owned—remains well-capitalized and
liquid, and has so far shown resilience to the global financial turmoil. Over the last two
years, the three largest banks were acquired by foreign banks; about 95 percent of bank assets
in El Salvador are now foreign owned. The banking system shows capital adequacy above the
regulatory minima of 12 and is relatively liquid (with net liquid assets to short-term liabilities
of 34.4 percent). Much of this liquidity is held at the central bank, which in turn invests it
conservatively. However, with a rising share of consumer and housing loans in total credit,
nonperforming loans (NPLs) have been on an upward trend since 2006. The impact of high
commodity prices and slower remittance growth on borrowers’ income may also have played a
role. Profitability levels fell in 2007, mainly on account of acquisition-related restructuring
costs, and remain subdued due to rising NPLs.

The fiscal position improved substantially in 2007, but is being undermined
in 2008 by the impact of high fuel prices on energy subsidies:
•

•

At 1.9 percent of GDP, the 2007 fiscal
deficit was 0.3 percent of GDP better than
the budget target, on account of continued
strong revenue growth and some
expenditure restraint. The 2007 primary
balance, estimated at ½ percent of GDP,
improved by 1 percent of GDP relative
to 2006, leading to a further decline in
public debt.
The public sector fiscal deficit for the seven
months to July 2008 increased relative to the
same period a year earlier, driven by higher
spending on energy subsidies and government
actions to mitigate the impact of food prices
(see below). Strong revenue performance,
particularly regarding income tax and VAT
receipts, cuts in nonpriority spending, and
some government measures to rationalize
energy subsidies, have partly offset the
deterioration in the operating surplus of public
enterprises and the rapid increase in spending
(see Box 1).

The government has actively responded to high commodity prices. Key measures
include expanding Red Solidaria (a well-targeted conditional cash transfer program),
increasing allowances for a tax credit program for middle-income families, eliminating import
tariffs on wheat and agricultural inputs, delivering seeds and fertilizers for agricultural
production, and granting a selective increase in wages of low-income public servants, with an
estimated impact of about 0.2 percent of GDP in 2008. The cost of these measures and of
energy subsidies has been met mainly through expenditure cuts on nonpriority spending and
continued tax administration improvements. Additional measures were introduced in July;
namely, a tax amnesty (with an estimated one-off fiscal impact of about 0.15 percent of GDP
this year); a new tax on incoming international phone calls (which would yield about
0.2 percent of GDP per year); and the gradual elimination, in three steps starting in
August 2008 and finishing in October 2009, of the electricity subsidy for the corporate sector,
expected to improve the operational surplus of the public electricity company (CEL) by
0.2 percent of GDP in 2009 and 0.4 percent of GDP per year thereafter.

Box 1. Energy Subsidies in El Salvador
Rising oil prices have led the cost of energy subsidies to almost double since end-2007 to an
estimated 2½ percent of GDP in 2008.
Energy subsidies are funded mainly by profits of the state-owned electricity company
(CEL) and the general budget. About half of the energy subsidies are associated with
electricity consumption, one-third with liquid gas, and the rest with public transport:
•

Lack of adjustment of electricity tariffs has provided a subsidy to final
consumers, funded by CEL. The tariff is currently US$91 MWH, compared to a
market price of US$141 MWH. Since half of the electricity generation is fuel-based, the
profits of CEL have been quickly eroding with rising oil prices.

•

Basic residential electricity consumption is also subsidized by the central
government. For consumption below 99 KWH per month the central government’s
budget covers 70 percent of the electricity bill. This subsidy is relatively inexpensive.

•

An administered price for liquid gas (LPG) by the government is in place for
residential consumers. Though recently increased to US$0.491 per gallon, the
market price is US$1.50 per gallon. Fund staff has estimated that only one-fifth of this
subsidy goes to low-income households, and there are concerns about undue use of
this subsidy by businesses and smuggling to neighboring countries.

•

Ceilings on tariffs for public transport are also established. To cover the difference
between operating costs and bus fares, the government grants a subsidy to bus
owners, which was doubled in June 2008 to US$800 per bus and US$400 per microbus
per month. To partially fund this increase, the government passed a new tax on
incoming international phone calls.

Initially, the government committed to maintaining energy subsidies until the
March 2009 elections, but their increasing cost prompted the adoption of offsetting
measures.
•

It increased the price of liquid gas by 23 percent last April, the first increase in 13 years.

•

It announced in July that the electricity subsidy for the nonresidential sector would be
gradually phased out by October 2009.

A comprehensive reform strategy for energy subsidies, however, is needed to improve
their efficiency and targeting. Such a strategy should eliminate the residential electricity
subsidy beyond the basic consumption threshold and improve the targeting of LPG and public
transport subsidies. This could lead to savings of about 0.8 percent of GDP.

7
II. SHORT-TERM OUTLOOK AND RISKS
9.
Despite relatively solid macroeconomic fundamentals, the outlook for 2008–09 is
clouded by a combination of external and domestic shocks.
•

The external environment is likely to remain difficult. Continued global financial
turmoil is leading to tighter external financing conditions for banks and corporations 1 ,
which could further constrain domestic investment and consumption. The continued
U.S. slowdown projected throughout 2009 (and with serious downside risks in light of
the worsening financial crisis), will negatively impact growth, given strong linkages
between the two economies through exports, remittances, and financial flows.2 Global
fuel and basic grain prices are projected to stabilize above their 2007 average levels,
resulting in a deterioration in the terms of trade. These shocks might lead to further
increases in banks’ NPLs, yet another channel for slowing credit and domestic
economic activity.

•

On the domestic front, the main concern is political uncertainty, which could
trigger financial volatility (such as a slowdown in capital flows, deposit withdrawals,
and an increase in interest rates) as the elections draw closer.3

10.
The near-term outlook will be marked by adjustment to these shocks. In this
officially dollarized economy, the balance of payments is self-stabilizing: if the supply of
foreign currency falls, the adjustment will be borne

1

Information provided by the authorities suggests that the direct exposure of the financial system to distressed
foreign assets is limited.

2

The elasticity of El Salvador’s economic cycle with respect to the U.S. cycle is estimated to be close to one, with
a lag of 2–3 quarters.

3

In the months before the 2004 general elections, which were also tight but in which the left-wing party did not
have a clear lead in the polls, there was a moderate decline in term deposits (a fall of 4 percent y/y in February
2004). This was generally attributed to electoral factors.

Though there are no formal data on wage levels, public and private sector representatives, as well as independent
analysts, confirmed that there are no signs of generalized wage pressures yet.

elimination of the electricity subsidy for the corporate sector. The widening of the current
account deficit in 2008—financed by FDI inflows (likely to halve after their 2007 peak) and
commercial banks’ net foreign assets—would begin to reverse in 2009 as commodity prices
stabilize and the public and private sectors adjust their savings accordingly.
11.
A key risk to the short-term outlook is a domestic liquidity crisis triggered by a
deteriorating external environment and growing political uncertainty. These shocks could
hamper the public sector’s ability to meet its short-term financing needs, which competes with
banks for an increasingly tight pool of liquidity. The central government has to roll over or
place a total of about US$250 million of debt (including from public trust funds) by end-2008.
In the absence of legislative approval for long-term financing, the government has increased its
reliance on short-term debt instruments (LETES). However, it could face significant
difficulties in placing LETES at maturities that go beyond the presidential election. Political
uncertainty coupled with the external financial turbulence could also lead to a sustained loss of
bank deposits, a cut-off of external credit for banks, and systemic liquidity shortages. Given
the prominent local presence of international financial institutions such as HSBC, Scotiabank,
and Citibank, stress in a parent bank could also have an adverse impact on deposits or reduce
the availability of external credit for the local subsidiaries.
III. EXTERNAL STABILITY AND MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK
12.
Under current policies, GDP growth would recover slowly to reach 4 percent and
public debt would stabilize at about 40 percent of GDP through 2013. The absence of
further fiscal consolidation would erode growth via higher interest rates and lower
productivity-enhancing spending. Based on the strong nominal anchor provided by official
dollarization, inflation would gradually fall to about 3 percent by 2010. The current account
deficit would narrow slowly, leading to a mild reduction in external debt. Given the absence of
structural fiscal and financial reforms, the economy would be more vulnerable to negative
shocks, the room for policy action would be more limited, and the risk of a financial crisis
would be higher.
13.
In the baseline scenario, premised on the policy recommendations described in
section IV, growth would reach 4½ percent and public debt decline to about 30 percent of
GDP by 2013. 5 On account of a subdued domestic demand, but stronger net exports than in
recent years, growth is projected to converge to its potential rate of 4½ percent. This rate is
underpinned by structural reforms adopted during the last decade, further integration of the
Salvadoran economy into the global economy, continued output diversification, and an
increase in public spending on infrastructure. Inflation is expected to fall to 3 percent, as the
inflationary impact of commodity prices subsides and domestic demand adjusts to restore
external equilibrium. 6 The public sector primary surplus would gradually improve to
5

6

The baseline scenario encompasses policy actions that are deemed to be feasible and realistic.

The projected inflation path would be the same under current policies, as the inflationary pressure exerted by a
higher fiscal deficit would be offset, ceteris paribus, by a compression in private demand through higher interest
rates. Also, the complete elimination of energy subsidies under the baseline may have a one-off effect on prices
that would be absent in the current policies scenario.

1.9 percent of GDP by 2013 and public debt would fall to about 30 percent of GDP, mostly
driven by revenue efforts. 7 8

Sensitivity analyses suggest that, were key variables to remain at their historical average—GDP growth at
2.9 percent, real interest rates at 2.9 percent, and primary deficit at 1.2 percent—public sector debt would increase
to 44 percent by the end of the projection period.

It is assumed that external financing from multilateral development banks would become available through a
political agreement between the two main parties.

In the absence of a crisis scenario, the medium-term external position of

A continued strengthening of public and private savings will lead to a gradual
narrowing of the current account deficit to about 4 percent of GDP by 2013. This
level is, according to staff research, broadly in line with the underlying deficit
consistent with structural current account determinants. This would allow total external
debt to fall to 41 percent in 2013. 9

The debt-stabilizing noninterest current account deficit is estimated to be about 3 percent of GDP (with net
interest payments averaging about 2–2½ percent of GDP).

External savings

The real effective exchange rate (REER) appears broadly in line with
fundamentals. 10 The REER depreciated from early 2007 to the first quarter of 2008,
as the continued weakening of the U.S. dollar vis-à-vis the weighted average of
El Salvador’s trading partners’ currencies offset the increase in local inflation during
the period (though this trend reversed more recently given a stronger dollar and higher
domestic inflation) (see Box 2). Despite this REER depreciation, higher GDP growth
and strong remittance and FDI inflows more than offset a worsening of the terms of
trade in 2007, leading to both an appreciation of the equilibrium REER and a widening
of the current account deficit.

Standard competitiveness indicators suggest that the export sector remains
competitive (see Box 2). The solid export performance in recent months confirms that
the sector is well positioned to contribute to the external adjustment process.

To assess the REER level, staff used a fundamental equilibrium approach, linking the actual path of the REER
with the level predicted by the trend values of the fundamentals.

12

Box 2. External Competitiveness
Dollar weakness favored price competitiveness
up to the first quarter of 2008, but the spike in
local inflation has reversed the trend since. The
pick-up in domestic inflation in El Salvador
triggered a real appreciation vis-à-vis the
U.S. However, the fall of the dollar vis-à-vis the
currencies of other trading partners pushed down
the nominal and real effective exchange rates up
to March 2008. The REER has appreciated
thereafter on the back of continued high local
inflation, but it is still below its level 12 months
before.

Export performance has been very strong in 2008. Several years of modest export growth, mainly as
a result of the rise of China and a decline in the maquila sector, led to a loss of share in the U.S. and
world markets. However, maquila export growth bottomed out in 2006 and reached positive territory by
the end of last year. Traditional (mainly coffee) and nontraditional exports have also had a strong
rebound this year. As a result, exports have been growing at over 16 percent in the year to August.

El Salvador compares well with Central American countries in competitiveness rankings, but
continues to be affected by crime. It ranks second in the region in the World Bank’s Doing Business
Report, which focuses on regulatory costs for starting and operating a business, and third in the Global
Competitiveness Index, which considers a broader set of factors. The country does well in infrastructure,
goods and factors market efficiency, and macro stability, but is hindered by low human capital (health
and education), poor technological sophistication and innovation, and high and rising crime.

15.
The main risks to the medium-term outlook are associated with the global
financial turmoil as well as with the level of commitment of the new administration to
macro stability and structural reforms. If the global financial turmoil were to persist
beyond 2009, leading the global growth slowdown to be more protracted than currently
projected, the Salvadoran economic performance would be affected through exports,
remittances, and the flows of foreign finance. Risks could also arise from a major change in
policies by the next administration or lower-than-projected remittance inflows (which account
for about 18 percent of GDP).
IV. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
16.
Discussions focused on fiscal and financial policies to prepare for potential risks
associated with the external shocks and election-related uncertainty, and address key
medium-term macroeconomic and social challenges. In particular, the discussions centered
on:
•

Government policies in the run-up to the 2009 elections to smooth adjustments to
external shocks and political uncertainty.

•

The roadmap of policies and reforms that the next administration would need to adopt
to enhance the resilience of the macroeconomy and the financial sector to shocks, and
create the conditions for higher growth and a faster reduction in poverty.
A. Short-Term Policies to Address Global Shocks and Political Uncertainty

17.
For the short term, the focus of discussions was on policies to support macro
stability and contain potential risks from external and domestic shocks:
•

Design contingency measures to reduce risks in the run-up to the elections:
► Enhance financial sector crisis preparedness. In line with previous staff
recommendations, the authorities introduced in July a temporary 3 percent liquid asset
requirement on banks, to buttress liquidity levels ahead of the elections. They are also
negotiating external credit lines for the central bank, and are drawing up action plans on
how to deal with situations of stress in the banking system. There was agreement on the
need to closely monitor banks (e.g., their short-term borrowing, deposits, and liquidity
levels) and cooperate more closely with their home supervisors.
► Improve the access to, and the profile of, budget financing. There was agreement
on the need to allow for higher interest rates on short-term debt instruments (LETES) to
lengthen their maturity beyond the elections and the changeover in government. Staff
noted that the reliance on LETES has worsened the term structure of public debt and
increased vulnerabilities. There was agreement on the urgent need to reach a political
agreement with the opposition to restore government’s access to long-term finance
(which requires approval by a 2/3 majority in congress), including financing by

14
multilateral development banks (MDBs). The government is working to reach such an
agreement, and has secured a credit line with a regional development bank (CABEI).
•

Maintain fiscal restraint. The mission commended the authorities for the strong fiscal
performance in 2007, and agreed with them on the need to maintain fiscal restraint,
while expanding social programs to mitigate the impact of high commodity prices on
the poor. Maintaining fiscal restraint is particularly important in light of the tightness of
liquidity. 11 Therefore, staff recommended that increases in well-targeted social
programs (such as Red Solidaria) be accommodated within a public sector deficit target
of 2.3 percent of GDP for 2008. 12 This would require further improvements in tax
administration and cutting nonpriority primary expenditure, including through
enhanced controls of energy subsidies, specifically in the cases of gas and public
transport. To reduce the risk of a wage-price spiral, the mission noted the need to limit
public wage increases. There was agreement that the 2009 budget should target a deficit
of 2.2 percent of GDP: higher spending in 2009 due to the impact of increases in public
wages and the transportation subsidy would be offset by the newly adopted tax on
incoming international calls, grants from the Millennium Challenge Corporation, and
savings that will kick in from the recent reform of electricity subsidies.

18.
The authorities expressed their willingness to continue adopting administrative
measures ahead of the elections. These would include measures on the fiscal revenue and
spending sides to provide additional room for expanding well-targeted programs and reduce
the cost of subsidy abuse. 13
B. Medium-Term Policies to Enhance the Economy’s Resilience and Growth Potential
19.
The key policy challenges for El Salvador over the medium term are: to build up
the economy’s resilience to shocks and create the conditions for counter-cyclical policies; and
to boost the trend growth rate of real GDP. Staff suggested, and the authorities agreed, that the
medium-term issues be discussed in a seminar with the new economic team and the IFIs
following the elections.
Fiscal policy
20.
There was agreement that medium-term fiscal policy be geared toward creating
the fiscal space necessary to respond to shocks and address priority spending needs. A
stronger medium-term fiscal position will increase the ability of fiscal policy (the main policy
lever under official dollarization) to react in cases of external or domestic shocks (including

11

While in principle the solid fiscal position should allow for some fiscal easing, particularly in case of a sharperthan-expected growth slowdown, the lack of financing would place a tight limit on the deficit. Additionally,
allowing the deficit to expand might exacerbate liquidity shortages for banks.
12

Due to slower projected growth, the baseline deficit projection is slightly higher than the one discussed during
the mission of 2.2 percent of GDP.
13

The authorities have requested Fund technical assistance to improve the targeting of energy subsidies.

15
natural disasters) and adopt counter-cyclical policies. It was agreed that continued fiscal
consolidation should be achieved while enabling higher spending on well-targeted social
programs and productivity-enhancing public infrastructure.
21.
A fiscal strategy anchored on reducing public debt to about 30 percent of GDP
by 2013 would help achieve these objectives. 14 The strategy would imply an improvement of
about 1¾ percent of GDP in the public sector primary surplus between 2009 and 2013. 15 Much
of this improvement (1 percent of GDP) would be achieved through tax revenue measures, and
the rest through reductions in spending.
22.

To ensure the success of this strategy, staff recommended:

•

Strengthening tax policy and administration, with the aim of raising the tax-to-GDP
ratio by 1 percent of GDP to 15 percent by 2013. This would require additional efforts
to improve the administration’s auditing capacity, cross-checking information systems
and customs valuation procedures. It may also require a streamlining of tax incentives
and, possibly, an increase in the VAT rate. 16 The authorities requested Fund TA to
assess the potential yield of measures other than raising tax rates.

•

Improving the efficiency and targeting of public spending. Eliminating the
electricity subsidy for the nonresidential sector should yield about 0.4 percent of GDP
per year. To build up on this achievement, staff recommended to (i) limit the electricity
subsidy to low-income groups (which would save a further 0.2 percent of GDP per
year); and (ii) improve the targeting and the pricing of public transport and gas
subsidies, with an estimated yield of 0.6 percent of GDP per year. The government
could redirect these savings toward well-targeted social programs (0.4 percent of GDP)
and public investment (0.2 percent of GDP), while the public electricity company
(CEL) would also be able to expand its investment program (0.3 percent of GDP).

•

Reducing other current spending by about ½ percent of GDP by 2013, mainly
through restraint on wages and purchases of goods and services (0.5 percent of GDP)
and the envisaged pension reform (0.1 percent of GDP), discussed below. 17

•

Further reforming the pension system. Staff stressed the need for further parametric
reforms to the pension system (such as reducing replacement rates and increasing the
retirement age) with a view to reducing the still-high transition costs (from the pay-as-

14

For emerging markets, a range between 25–50 percent of GDP is usually deemed as reasonable.

15

Grants are expected to increase moderately during the projection period, reflecting financial assistance totaling
about 2.3 percent of GDP from the Millennium Challenge Corporation.
16

17

An increase of 1 percentage point in the VAT rate would yield about ½ percent of GDP.

Specific measures to support cuts in nonpension current spending would be identified in the context of the
Public Expenditure Review to be prepared jointly by the WB and the IDB, expected to be completed in 2009.

liabilities. 18 The authorities are opposed to implementing a parametric pension reform.

Financial sector
23.
The authorities and staff agreed that the internationalization of the banking
system entails benefits as well as challenges for macro-financial stability. The increased
presence of large international banks should help deepen financial intermediation, introduce
superior risk management and corporate governance practices, and provide easier access to
international capital markets. However, it also exposes the local economy to events from
abroad, could introduce more volatility in capital inflows, and poses a challenge for domestic
supervision.
24.
The mission welcomed the financial sector reforms undertaken since the last
Article IV Consultation. In particular, it noted the internal restructuring of the financial
system superintendency, intended to underpin the move toward risk-based supervision; the
ongoing contacts with the home supervisors of foreign-owned banks; and the passage of a bill
that provides a legal framework for the securitization of financial assets. On this latter issue,
staff recommended strict regulations to prevent asset originators from fully passing on credit
risks to third parties.
25.
There was consensus on the need to implement key structural reforms in the
financial sector. These include: (i) passage of the bill to strengthen financial supervision; (ii)
strengthening the central bank’s liquidity management and lender-of-last-resort functions,
including through a recapitalization by the treasury, a reform enabling it to pool commercial

17
bank reserves to transfer liquidity to banks in distress (at present, an individual bank can only
access its own reserves); (iii) bolstering the deposit insurance fund to 5 percent of total
deposits (from the current 1 percent) by increasing the premium paid by banks; and (iv)
approving the existing bill to enhance the legal basis for mutual funds.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
26.
Economic fundamentals are solid, but the economy is entering a downturn and
there are significant risks to the near-term outlook. As a result of sustained economic
reforms over the last few years, the fiscal position improved, the public debt-to-GDP ratio
declined, and, in 2007, economic growth reached its highest level in a decade. However, the
current turmoil in world financial markets, a global growth slowdown, and electoral
uncertainty entail considerable risks to the outlook.
27.
Against the background of these developments, crisis preparedness and
contingency measures are paramount. In the financial sector, these include monitoring
banks’ liquidity and their short-term borrowing closely, drawing up concrete action plans to
deal with stress in the banking system, and negotiating contingent credit lines. Staff welcomes
the steps the authorities have already taken, including the introduction of a temporary 3 percent
liquid asset requirement on banks, but continued efforts are necessary. In the public sector, the
authorities should allow for higher interest rates to lengthen the maturity of short-term debt
beyond the election and seek a political agreement to access long-term financing from MDB’s.
28.
Faced with increased risks, the authorities’ main challenge is to maintain
macroeconomic stability. A critical component is the need to exercise fiscal restraint. Staff
recommends a public sector deficit target of 2.3 percent of GDP in 2008; increases in welltargeted social programs should be accommodated within this envelope. Also, staff welcomes
the authorities’ 2009 budget deficit target of 2.2 percent of GDP, which reflects increases in
public wages and transportation subsidies as well as the impact of the recent reform of
electricity subsidies and a newly adopted tax on international calls.
29.
The authorities and staff agree on the need to move structural reforms in the
financial sector forward. These include passage of the bill to strengthen financial
supervision, improvements in the central bank’s liquidity and its ability to act as lender-of-lastresort, bolstering the deposit insurance fund to 5 percent of total deposits, and passage of a bill
to enhance the legal basis for mutual funds.
30.
In the medium term, the authorities need to continue reforms aimed at enhancing
the economy’s resilience and growth potential. Priorities include: reducing public debt to
about 30 percent of GDP through tax revenue measures and cuts in nonpriority spending,
improving the efficiency and targeting of subsidies, and implementing a parametric reform of
the pension system.
31.
Staff analysis indicates that the REER is broadly in line with fundamentals. Solid
export performance in 2008 and standard competitiveness indicators suggest that the export
sector remains competitive.

18
32.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

1/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms,
g = real GDP growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock.
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP)
remain at their levels of the last projection year.

Appendix I: El Salvador––Statistical Issues
Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. The
Central Bank (CB) makes data available to the public through regular official
publications and its website (http://www.bcr.gob.sv/). El Salvador subscribed to Special
Data Dissemination Standards in June 1998. The data module of the Report on the
Observance of Standards and Codes (data ROSC) was published in December 2004.
Monetary and Financial Statistics
Several financial institutions have yet to distinguish transactions using the residency
criterion. With Salvadoran banks actively lending in the region, the lack of reliable
information on transactions by residency status and on foreign branch activity is
complicating interpretation of the monetary and credit aggregates. Following the adoption
of the U.S. dollars as legal tender, the use of the principle of residence acquired more
relevance, since all accounts are denominated in U.S. dollars. In addition, there is a need
to improve estimates of M1 by incorporating a reliable measure of dollars circulating in
the economy, and of broad money by including all financial intermediaries in the
financial system.
Government Finance Statistics
The principal outstanding issue is the compilation of reliable data on the operations of the
local governments. The ministry of finance conducts a quarterly survey of 50 local
governments, including the largest municipalities. However, the reporting of the survey is
not consistent, as some local governments provide information with a lag or do not report
at all.
Real Sector and Prices Statistics
The CB produces both current and constant price (base 1990) annual national accounts
following the 1968 SNA, with a lag of around nine months. Also, it produces quarterly
GDP, using the production approach and disseminates these data three months after the
end of the reference period. Recognizing the efforts to improve source data, the 2003 data
ROSC mission stressed the need for modernizing the statistical system. The Central
Bureau of Statistics and Census conducted during August–November 2005 various
surveys to improve data sources on industry, trade and services. The CB is in the process
of changing the base year of the national accounts and implementing the 1993 SNA.

34
The consumer price index has a sound methodological basis and its coverage is confined
to the San Salvador metropolitan area and the three largest departmental capitals
representing 85 percent of the urban population. New weights derived from the National
Urban Household Income and Expenditure Survey of 2007 will be adopted in early 2009.
The authorities also compile a producer price index, which is confined to the San
Salvador metropolitan area and the departments of La Libertad and Santa Ana.
External Sector Statistics
The compilation of balance of payments statistics follows the fifth edition of the Balance
of Payments Manual (BPM5). There has been a significant improvement in the coverage
and timeliness of balance of payments statistics in recent years. In particular, the CB has
made significant progress in obtaining information on services, foreign direct investment,
private external debt, and goods for processing, as well as for the international investment
position. There is scope for improving the quality and consistency of the customs
declaration, processed electronically. Also, a few weaknesses remain in the measurement
of cross-border capital flows.
External Vulnerability Indicators
The CB compiles information about the external indebtedness of the nonbank private
sector.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
November 12, 2008
1.
This statement reports on developments since the issuance of the staff report for
the 2008 Article IV Consultation. It does not change the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Recent data releases and financial market developments point to a continued
economic slowdown and moderation in inflation, but there has been a slight uptick in export
and remittance growth.
•
The monthly index of economic activity grew 3.5 percent in the year to August,
decelerating from a 3.8 percent pace in July, with manufacturing, financial, and tourismrelated industries all softening.
•
Inflation moderated to 7.4 percent y/y in October, from 8.7 percent in September,
owing to the global downturn in commodity prices.
•
Remittances rose 4.7 percent in the year to September after increasing 4.4 percent in
the year to August, but remain below the 5–6 percent rate of growth seen earlier this year.
•
Export and import growth ticked up slightly in the year to September, to 16.3 percent
and 16.8 percent (from 15.8 percent and 16.1 percent in August, respectively).
•
Sovereign spreads remain at almost 700 basis points, up by 300 basis points since
early October and 80 more basis points than the average increase in Latin American spreads.
3.
The latest downward revision to the global outlook is expected to weigh on growth
in 2009, projected now at 2.0 percent, down from 2.6 percent in the staff report.
4.
Lower commodity prices and slower growth in domestic demand than previously
forecast are expected to reduce inflation and cut the current account deficit. End-period
inflation is now estimated at 7.5 percent in 2008 and 5 percent in 2009—previously at 9 and
6 percent, respectively. The current account deficit is now projected at 5.5 percent of GDP
in 2008 and 3.4 percent of GDP in 2009, from 6.1 and 5.4 percent of GDP in the staff report.
5.
The government has moved to buttress its short-term liquidity position. An agreement
was reached with the opposition party, leading the Salvadoran congress to authorize the
government to negotiate $950 million in World Bank and IDB loans; $650 million would be
used to repay the sovereign bond maturing in 2011, with the other $300 million to fund
various social expenditures. A second congressional vote would be required to approve the
borrowing once the loan agreements have been finalized.

Public Information Notice (PIN) No. 08/151
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
December 31, 2008

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with El Salvador
On November 12, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with El Salvador. 1
Background
Like in other Central American countries, economic growth is expected to decelerate, on
the back of the U.S. slowdown. While real GDP growth rose to 4.7 percent in 2007, a
record high in the last decade, it is expected to decelerate to 3.2 percent in 2008.
However, the monthly economic activity indicator has signaled a mild but steady
slowdown thereafter, reaching an average growth rate of 3.2 percent in the year to
August. Headline inflation increased from 4.9 percent (year-on-year) in December 2007
to 9.9 percent this August, mainly due to soaring global commodity (food and fuel) prices.
With the sharp decline in commodity prices more recently, inflation fell to 5.3 percent in
November. The current account deficit widened in the first part of the year, with strong
exports and resilient remittances only partly offsetting higher fuel prices, but is expected
to moderate reflecting lower commodity prices and a slower domestic demand. Foreign
Direct Investment flows have subsided after their unusually high level in 2007 related to
the foreign purchase of banks, but remain relatively strong so far.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities.

2
The banking system—now mainly foreign-owned—remains highly liquid, and has shown
resilience to the global financial turbulence so far. Over the last two years, the three
largest banks were acquired by foreign banks; about 90 percent of the banking system
assets in El Salvador are now foreign owned. The banking system shows liquidity ratios
above 34 percent. Average profitability levels fell in 2007, mainly on account of
acquisition-related restructuring costs, but have recovered this year. With a rising share
of consumer and housing loans in total credit, non-performing loans have been on an
upward trend since 2006.
The fiscal position improved substantially in 2007, but was undermined in 2008 by the
impact of high fuel prices on energy subsidies. The public sector fiscal deficit for the first
half of this year increased relative to the same period a year earlier, driven by higher
spending on energy subsidies and government actions to mitigate the impact of food
prices. Strong revenue performance, particularly regarding income tax and VAT receipts,
cuts in nonpriority spending, and some government measures to rationalize energy
subsidies, have partly offset the deterioration in the operating surplus of public
enterprises and the rapid increase in subsidies. The government has actively responded
to high commodity prices with key measures that include expanding well-targeted social
programs such as Red Solidaria (a conditional cash transfer program), increasing
allowances for a tax credit program for middle-income families, eliminating import tariffs
on wheat and agricultural inputs, delivering seeds and fertilizers for agricultural
production, and granting a selective increase in wages of low-income public servants of
between 2.5–5 percent.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the strength of El Salvador’s macroeconomic
fundamentals, which is the result of several years of sound policies, well-oriented
structural reforms, and a favorable external environment. However, economic growth has
decelerated recently, as in other Central American countries, on the back of the
U.S. slowdown and the food and fuel price shock. The global financial crisis and electoral
uncertainty have led to some tightening in domestic financial conditions, although the
banking system remains resilient.
Directors considered that El Salvador’s main challenge in the short run is to maintain
macroeconomic stability and mitigate the impact of the shock on the poor. The policy
priorities are to improve crisis preparedness in the financial sector, maintain fiscal
restraint, and secure government financing in the coming year. Over the medium term,
fiscal and financial sector reforms should continue to aim at enhancing the economy’s
resilience and growth potential. Directors agreed that El Salvador’s real effective
exchange rate is broadly in line with economic fundamentals, and that the export sector
remains competitive.
Directors stressed that, in the face of global shocks and political uncertainty, it will be
critically important to prepare the financial sector for potential liquidity or solvency
problems and move forward with contingency planning. The introduction of a temporary
3 percent liquid asset requirement and the negotiation of a credit line for the central bank

3
with a regional development bank are welcome steps in this direction. Directors
encouraged the authorities to closely monitor banks’ short-term borrowing and liquidity
positions, enhance cooperation with home supervisors, draw up concrete action plans to
deal with possible stress in the banking system in the future, and negotiate additional
contingent credit lines to bolster the central bank’s ability to provide liquidity for
emergency assistance to banks. Careful monitoring of asset quality and credit risk will
also be important.
Executive Directors noted that the fiscal deficit targets—2.3 percent of GDP in 2008 and
2.2 percent of GDP in 2009—are consistent with the objective of maintaining fiscal
restraint. In this context, they supported the planned expansion of well-targeted social
programs and reduction in nonpriority expenditure, while encouraging efforts to enhance
controls of energy subsidies and to limit public wage increases.
Directors welcomed recent actions to secure additional financing and to improve the
maturity structure of public debt. In particular, they commended the government for
reaching a political agreement with the opposition to ensure congressional approval to
negotiate loans amounting to US$950 million from the World Bank and the InterAmerican Development Bank.
Directors supported the authorities’ strategy of anchoring medium-term fiscal policy on
the goal of reducing public debt to about 30 percent of GDP by 2013 while increasing
well-targeted social and infrastructure spending. This would increase the ability of fiscal
policy to react to external or domestic shocks and adopt a counter-cyclical stance, and at
the same time enhance the economy’s growth potential. Achieving this goal will require
measures in several areas, including tax revenue enhancements, further cuts in
nonpriority spending, improvements in the efficiency and targeting of subsidies, and a
parametric reform of the pension system.
Directors also stressed the importance of further reforms of the financial sector to
strengthen El Salvador’s resilience to shocks. Key measures include passing the bill to
strengthen financial supervision; enhancing the central bank’s legal power to provide
liquidity to banks in distress; and bolstering the deposit insurance fund. A few Directors
expressed reservations against a recommendation, made in the case of El Salvador, for
strict regulations to prevent asset originators from fully passing on credit risks to third
parties.

Statement by Ramon Guzman, Executive Director for El Salvador
and Alvaro Umaña, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
November 12, 2008
We would like to thank staff for their efforts in the consultation process and for a concise and
well-written report. Sustained economic reforms and sound macro-economic policies
implemented by El Salvador over the last four years have paid off in terms of economic
growth, which reached its highest level in a decade in 2007. At the same time, poverty has
been reduced significantly, the fiscal situation has improved and public debt has declined as a
percentage of GDP over the same period. In spite of these important achievements, given the
present global crisis, the external environment is challenging for all countries, and there are
also some uncertainties associated with the upcoming elections.
The Central American region has started to feel the effects of the slowdown in the US
economy, its main economic partner. In the case of El Salvador, the links to the US economy
are particularly important both as a destination for exports as well as the source of
remittances. Although the growth of remittances has slowed down to 5.3 percent (through
September 2008), total remittances have continued to grow in absolute terms. Export growth,
close to 16 percent, has been strong, particularly from coffee, maquila and non-traditional
sectors. Given these positive results and a strong public investment program, the growth rate
is only expected to slow down to 3.5 percent in 2008 and to stay at that level in 2009.
World price increases in food and oil have impacted inflationary levels in the Central
American region considerably and El Salvador has not been the exemption; however, the
latest figures available (October 2008) show inflation slowing slightly to 7.4 percent, one of
the lowest levels in the region. Import growth has been driven primarily by oil and food price
increases and this has put pressure on the balance of payments this year. However, recent
price decreases in oil and commodities are likely to contribute to easing this pressure as we
move into 2009.
The international financial crisis and internal conditions have contributed to some tightening
in domestic financial conditions and credit growth has slowed down. The central government
has rolled over most of the US$250 million of debt due during the rest of 2008, including a
CABEI purchase of US$100 million in one-year LETES, which was completed this past
week.
It is important to clarify that El Salvador’s sovereign debt rating has not been downgraded by
Standard & Poor’s. Its rating remains BB+, one notch below investment grade. The outlook,
however, has been changed from stable to negative. Sovereign debt spreads have fluctuated
in line with other Latin American countries.

The banking system, which is now almost entirely foreign owned, is well capitalized, liquid
and profitable. Capital adequacy is well above the regulatory minima, liquidity ratios are
above 30 percent and, thus far, the system has shown resilience to the present global turmoil.
The fiscal position, which had improved in 2007, with a deficit 0.3 percent better than the
budget, has suffered from high oil and commodity prices in 2008. The government has
attempted to offset high oil prices with energy subsidies for electricity, gas and public
transportation, as well as with an austerity program for the public sector. Household
electricity consumption is subsidized below 99 KWH per month with a cost of US$60
million, or 0.3 percent of GDP. LPG and public transportation are also subsidized and, to
partially offset these costs, the government has passed a new tax on incoming international
telephone calls that is expected to yield 0.3 percent of GDP. Also, a US$0.10/gal tax on fuels
has been adopted to finance the public transportation subsidy. Decreases in world oil prices
will have a positive impact on the cost of these subsidies and there are some opportunities for
improving the targeting of LPG subsidy.
The government has also put in place or expanded programs to respond to high commodity
prices. The Red Solidaria, a well-targeted cash transfer program has been expanded. The
Alianza para la Familia initiative, a broad effort to support working and non-working
families includes increases in education and health tax deductions, higher spending for
school food programs, free secondary education, and improved seed programs for rural
communities. These programs can be accommodated within the 2009 budget leading to a
targeted public deficit of 2.2 percent of GDP in that year.
The short-term outlook is challenging due to the difficulties in the external environment and
internal factors mentioned earlier. Real growth is expected to remain near 3.5 percent in 2009
and to recover to levels near 4 percent later on, while inflation would gradually fall to about 3
percent in 2010. Public investment will increase by more than 25 percent, including
construction of a new hydroelectric project, the start of operations of the new port at La
Unión, and a new road in the northern part of the country financed by the Millennium
Challenge Account. At the same time the current account deficit would narrow allowing for a
reduction in external debt. The real effective exchange rate (REER) is broadly in line with
fundamentals. Standard competitive indicators show that the export sector remains
competitive.
Key policy decisions in the short term are focused on maintaining macroeconomic stability
and enhancing financial sector crisis preparedness, including increasing liquid asset
requirements on banks, as well as close monitoring and drawing action plans on how to deal
with stress situations in the banking system. It is important to stress that the financial system
remains strong and resilient.

Restoring access to longer-term financing is also and important priority and there has been
considerable progress on this front since the Article IV consultation. A total of US$950
million has been initially approved by Congress on November 5 from multilateral
development institutions, including a US$ 500 million from the IADB and a US$450 million
loan from the World Bank. Out of these resources, US$650 million will be used to finance
the government’s 2011 Eurobond and the remaining resources will go to health, education
and priority social spending projects. These loans still require a final approval by Congress,
but the use of these funds have been agreed to by the government and the opposition parties.
Over the medium term, the fiscal strategy is geared to reducing public debt to about 30
percent of GDP by improving the public sector primary surplus between 2009 and 2013
through tax revenue measures of around 1 percent of GDP and improving the efficiency and
targeting of public spending. However, the authorities have not agreed to potential increase
in the VAT rate or pension reform. Other measures such as eliminating the electricity subsidy
for the nonresidential sector or better targeting of the gas and transportation subsidies are
under consideration but are dependent on the future path of international oil and gas prices.
Structural reforms are needed to increase the resilience of the financial system and these
include the passage of a bill to strengthen financial sector supervision, increasing the deposit
insurance fund to 5 percent of total deposits and passage of a bill to enhance the legal basis
for mutual funds.
In spite of the global economic slowdown, El Salvador is taking concrete and effective
contingency measures to face a potential liquidity crisis, it is maintaining a responsible fiscal
policy, it is undertaking a solid public investment program, it has a dynamic export sector
that has continued to grow, and its economy remains competitive. All these factors will
undoubtedly contribute to a prompt recovery in growth rates once the global situation has
improved.
