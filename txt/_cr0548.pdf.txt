REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA
Staff Report for the 2004 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2004 Consultation
with the Republic of Moldova
Approved by Alessandro Leipold and Tony Boote
January 18, 2005
Discussions for the 2004 Article IV consultation were held in Chisinau during
October 20–November 3, 2004. The team comprised Ms. Castello-Branco (head),
Mr. Cuc, Mr. Lundback, and Ms. Angelovska-Bezoska (all EUR), Mr. Bouton (World
Bank), and Mr. Ruggiero (the Fund Resident Representative). The team met with Prime
Minister Tarlev, National Bank of Moldova (NBM) Governor Talmaci, Minister of
Economy Lupu, Finance Minister Grecianîi, and other senior officials. The team also met
with representatives of parliament, business, civil society, and the diplomatic community.
In concluding the 2003 Article IV consultation on January 26, 2004, Executive Directors
urged the authorities to accelerate structural reforms to improve prospects for growth and
poverty reduction. In particular, Directors pressed the authorities to reduce administrative
interventions and improve the business environment.
Both Fund-and Bank-supported structural programs went off track and expired in late
2003 (Appendices I and II), while the EBRD has stepped up its engagement under its
Early Transition Countries Initiative (Appendix III). The authorities’ first full Economic
Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (EGPRSP) was discussed by Fund and
Bank Boards in November 2004. Executive Directors supported the strategy but stressed
the need to align current policies to those outlined in the EGPRSP and speed up
implementation to build up a track record for future financial support from IFIs.
Moldova has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund’s
Articles of Agreement. Its exchange system remains free of restrictions on payments and
transfers for current international transactions. Although appropriate legislation is in
place, improvements in the AML/CFT framework are needed to meet international
standards. These include preventive measures against terrorist financing and adequate
enforcement of the AML law.
Data quality has improved, but weaknesses remain, primarily with respect to price and
national accounts statistics (Appendix IV).

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
•

Economic activity remains vigorous on the back of large and rising workers’ remittances
and buoyant regional growth. GDP grew by 6.3 percent in 2003 and is estimated to
advance by another 7 percent in 2004, largely driven by domestic consumption. Although
inflation has been on a downward trend since October 2003, inflationary risks are on the
rise, fueled by an expansionary fiscal stance, fast credit growth, and strong foreign
currency inflows.

•

The economy is increasingly dependent on workers’ remittances. These inflows have
helped finance growing imports and fuel short-term growth, while providing a safety net
to Moldovans, but they also contributed to strengthening the leu. Despite a large real
exchange rate appreciation since mid-2003, external competitiveness appears favorable,
with exports growing briskly and dollar wages well below those in neighboring countries.

•

Policy discussions were dominated by four interrelated topics: the sustainability of the
current expansion; the appropriate macroeconomic policy mix; the role of remittances;
and policies to improve the business environment. The authorities view current growth as
evidence of the effectiveness of their policies. In contrast, staff identified several risks to
the medium-term outlook that call for policy adjustment, including rising inflationary
pressures, emerging capacity constraints, a difficult business environment, and lingering
vulnerability to external shocks.

•

Fiscal policy should be tightened to help make room for current external debt service and
support the central bank’s efforts to control inflation. To ensure fiscal sustainability,
fiscal policy would benefit from a more forward-looking perspective and greater reliance
on a medium-term expenditure framework. The authorities felt that their fiscal plans were
a realistic reflection of Moldova’s needs and priorities.

•

Monetary policy should place greater emphasis on the inflation objective, allowing the
exchange rate to appreciate if foreign exchange inflows continue to grow rapidly. Going
forward, a more flexible exchange rate policy would serve Moldova well in absorbing
possible external shocks. The central bank seems to be under increasing political pressure
to keep the leu stable. Financial soundness indicators are positive, but the financial sector
vulnerabilities identified by the FSAP need to be addressed.

•

Without an acceleration in structural reforms leading to a clear improvement in the
business environment, economic recovery is likely to be short-lived. The reform agenda
should include a decisive shift away from state intervention in economic activity and a
more determined effort to open the country to foreign investment and to fight corruption,
while maintaining a liberal trade regime.

•

The authorities have reiterated their interest in a Fund program. A convincing track
record of reform implementation in the context of the EGPRSP, coupled with tighter
short-term financial policies, could pave the way for future Fund financial support.

I. BACKGROUND
1.
The political landscape is shaped by upcoming parliamentary elections, prospects for
EU integration, and the long-standing conflict in the breakaway region of Transnistria. No
major change in economic policies is expected before the elections, slated for March 6, 2005.
An Action Plan providing a framework for enhanced cooperation with the EU within the
European Neighborhood Policy has been finalized; its endorsement is expected early in
2005. With OSCE-sponsored negotiations virtually deadlocked, prospects for resolving the
Transnistria conflict are bleak (Box 1).

Box 1: The Transnistria Issue at a Glance
Following a civil war in 1992, the region on the left bank of the Nistru
River (Transnistria) seceded. Before the breakup, this region accounted
for about 40 percent of Soviet Moldova’s GDP, 15 percent of its
population, and 12.5 percent of its territory. It was also home to the
bulk of Moldova’s industrial base. Twelve years later, the conflict
remains unresolved, largely because there are geopolitical and vested
interests in preserving the status quo, which provides opportunities for
tax evasion, smuggling, and other illegal activities. This situation
aggravates Moldova’s political risks and hampers growth prospects.
After Moldova rejected the final version of a federalization plan in late
2003, tensions increased, and escalated in mid-2004 over the closure of
some Romanian-language schools in Transnistria. This incident was
followed by the strict application by Moldova of regulations on
registration and certificates of origin for enterprises operating in
Transnistria, and retaliation from the latter, including a blockade of the Moldovan Railway line going
through Transnistria. Prospects for resuming negotiations are slim, with both leaderships showing little
appetite to compromise. Importantly, any solution to the conflict needs to address Transnistria’s large
external debt (mainly for energy supplies from Russia).

2.
Implementation of Fund advice has been marred by weak ownership at the highest
political levels, lack of political consensus for reforms, and capacity constraints. While
stabilization efforts have been reasonably successful and growth has resumed, Moldova’s
track record on structural reforms has been generally disappointing (Box 2).

-7-

Box 2: Implementation of Past Fund Policy Recommendations
Fund advice on monetary policy and financial sector reform has been followed closely. Indeed, a common
criticism of past Fund involvement is that it focused too much on institution-building in the financial sector,
while other institutions remained underdeveloped. Although fiscal policy has often been driven by political
pressure, important fiscal reforms have been implemented since the late 1990s, including the development
of a treasury system, a medium-term expenditure framework, and a consolidated budget presentation.
Together with appropriate monetary and fiscal adjustment to the 1998 regional crisis, these reforms paved
the way for economic recovery.
While the monetary/fiscal policy mix has been broadly in line with Fund advice, implementation of
structural policies advocated by the Fund and other IFIs has been uneven and incomplete. Slow progress
often reflected strong resistance from vested interests and, arguably, insufficient attention from policymakers and IFIs staff to political economy constraints.
Views about the usefulness of past Fund recommendations diverge. This partly reflects differences of
opinion within and outside the government and, within the government, between the top decision makers
and other officials. Most technical counterparts and former government officials find discussions with Fund
staff informative and helpful to push the reform agenda forward. They note, however, that weak capacity
has hindered implementation. At the highest political levels, the dialogue has recently become more
difficult. Pressure for reform has eased with the strong economic recovery, which the authorities consider as
corroboration of the effectiveness of their own policies.

3.
Economic activity benefited from a favorable external environment in 2003–04.
Despite a poor harvest, GDP grew by 6.3 percent in 2003, advancing to 6.5 percent (y-o-y) in
the first half of 2004. Large and rising workers’ remittances underpinned consumption-led
growth, helping consolidate Moldova’s recovery from the 1998 regional crisis.1
Consumption was also fueled by a marked increase in real wages and pensions. While strong
economic performance in neighboring countries encouraged exports, the contribution of net
trade to growth was negative (Figure 1). Fixed investment was boosted by a construction
boom but, at around 18 percent of GDP, remains relatively low to support long-term growth
(Table 1).

4.
Notwithstanding the present recovery, Moldova is lagging considerably behind its
neighbors, partly as a result of the Transnistria conflict. It is Europe’s poorest country,
with per capita gross national disposable income of $689 in 2003. Compared to its neighbors,
Moldova’s post-independence output collapse was deeper and its recovery more sluggish,
while human development indicators and per capita foreign direct investment have lagged
behind (Figure 2). Moreover, productive capacity has been sapped by the steady exodus of
working-age Moldovans following the 1998 crisis (at least 25 percent of the labor force).2
5.
The economy is increasingly dependent on workers’ remittances. Officially-recorded
remittances reached almost 25 percent of GDP in 2003 and continued to grow rapidly in
2004, placing Moldova in a clear lead among European countries.3 Actual figures could be
significantly higher. Remittances have fueled consumption and short-term growth and have
contributed—through higher imports—to Moldova’s widening trade deficit. In addition, they
have put the leu under appreciation pressure, complicating the conduct of monetary policy.4
At the same time, by financing consumption and imports, remittances have boosted VAT
collection (about two-thirds of VAT proceeds in 2004 came from imports), allowing higher
government spending. By making up for the lack of other external financing sources,
remittances have contributed to ease pressure for reforms. The impact of emigration and
remittances is not limited to economic activity: while remittances provide an important safety
net to the population, emigration has created considerable social disruption.
6.
Headline CPI inflation has moderated to low double-digits, after peaking at
17 percent in October 2003 (Figure 1). The appreciating leu has helped attenuate the impact
of higher oil prices (Box 3), but
Figure 3. Moldova: Average Monthly Wage Index,

have also been raised (notably in the social sector), in an attempt to bring them closer to the
economy-wide average.
7.
External competitiveness seems to be holding up, notwithstanding a marked real
exchange rate appreciation (Figure 4).5 Export performance has been strong, dollar wages are
well below those in neighboring countries, and the actual current account deficit is likely to
be overestimated in view of unrecorded remittances and trade overinvoicing/underinvoicing
(Table 2). Exports to the EU were particularly vibrant in 2003-04, reflecting the euro’s
strength, frontloading of export contracts ahead of the enlargement process, and a sharp
increase in textile exports, mainly based on import-for-export arrangements with countries
supplying raw materials for manufacturing in Moldova.
8.
Recent external debt restructuring agreements helped improve the medium-term debt
outlook. The most significant
agreement (in May 2004) was with

Box 3: Impact of Higher Petroleum Prices
Moldova depends heavily on imports for its
domestic primary energy needs—up to a 100
percent in the case of natural gas and
petroleum products. Petroleum consumption
has been growing rapidly (30 percent
between 2000 and 2003), although in percapita terms it remains the lowest in the
region. In 2003, petroleum products
accounted for 10 percent of Moldova’s total
imports (7.3 percent of GDP).
In recent years, import prices of refined
petroleum products have risen in line with
international crude oil prices. Staff estimates
that an oil price increase of $10 per barrel
would raise Moldova’s trade deficit by
2.5 percent of GDP and consumer prices by
2–2.5 percent.

These first-round effects on the balance of
payments could be offset by expected higher
spending and imports by Russia. Using an
estimate of 6.7 million barrels per day for
Russia’s petroleum exports, its incremental
revenue from an oil price increase of $10 per
barrel would be $24 billion annually. If
about one-third of this were spent on
additional imports—and Moldova succeeded
in maintaining its export share—Moldova’s
incremental exports would offset fully the
higher energy import bill. Data for the first
nine months of 2004 confirm this: exports to
Russia grew by 18 percent relative to the
same period in 2003, in excess of the
16 percent needed to finance higher
petroleum import costs.

The fiscal stance was loosened considerably in 2004 (Text Table 2; Tables 3a and
3b). The strong tax revenue performance in 2003 carried over into 2004, owing to more
aggressive tax collection efforts and

expects the general government
deficit to have reached 1.1 percent of GDP in 2004 (versus a deficit of 0.4 percent of GDP in
the original budget). With limited fresh external financing and lower-than-expected
privatization receipts, the government increased recourse to bank financing and continued to
run up arrears to some bilateral creditors but resumed interest payments to Paris Club
creditors.
10.
The large inflows of remittances in 2003-04 fuelled the tensions between the multiple
objectives of monetary policy: bringing down inflation, containing leu appreciation,
accumulating international reserves, and keeping interest rates low. With inflation
moderating in 2004, the NBM intervened heavily in the foreign exchange market. As a result,
international reserves hit a record high of $392 million at end-September (Figure 5), finally
reaching pre-1998 levels. Despite more intense sterilization efforts through use of repos,
deposit auctions, and direct T-bill sales, by end-October both reserve and broad money were
growing at over 30 percent (y-o-y) (Table 4). Financial soundness indicators are strong, but
credit continues to grow rapidly and lending rates have remained high, signaling a substantial
risk premium on private sector credit (Table 5 and Figure 6).6 Following Fund advice, since
July 2004 the NBM has been gradually implementing a system where required reserves for

Credit to the private sector rose from 14 to 22 percent of GDP between 2000 and the third quarter of
2004. Nonetheless, the share of nonperforming loans dropped by two-thirds in the same period,
although the share of loans under supervision—signaling potential future problems that may require
attention by banks’ management—edged up.

Structural reforms continue to move slowly. Government intervention remains
widespread, political and corporate governance are weak, and corruption is pervasive
(Figure 7). The EBRD transition indicators and a recent World Bank Investment Climate
Assessment confirm that the business environment is among the most difficult in the region,
with high transaction costs holding back private sector-led growth. The completion of the
EGPRSP is an important step in the right direction, but progress in implementation has been
slow and patchy. Attempts to make headway in the areas of deregulation, SME development,
investment policy, and social assistance targeting have shown limited results so far.
Nevertheless, the authorities have intensified their efforts to simplify licensing and business
registration; new laws on microfinance and on investment (unifying treatment of foreign and
domestic investors) have been adopted; laws on audit, accounting, and leasing are being
reviewed; and a renewed attempt to curb corruption is in the works. Moreover, progress on
fiscal reform has been achieved.7 By contrast, privatization has stalled, with several
enterprises removed from the privatization program.8 Price controls and export restrictions
continue to distort economic incentives, and higher rates of effective protection apply to
selected sectors.
II. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
12.
With no major departure from current policies envisaged in the run-up to the March
2005 elections, discussions focused on four interrelated topics:
•

The sustainability of the current expansion. The key issue is whether the current
growth momentum—consumption-driven and dependent on remittances—can be
sustained in the medium term.

•

The macroeconomic policy mix. The combination of an expansionary fiscal stance,
fast money and credit growth, rising wages, and strong foreign currency inflows has
intensified inflation risks, suggesting that adjustments in current macroeconomic
policies should be considered.

•

The role of remittances. For remittances to contribute positively to long-term growth,
an environment supportive of private sector development is required. This would
encourage greater use of these transfers for investment and stem the exodus of
working-age population.

Improving the business environment. While the EGPRSP appropriately focuses on
policies to improve the investment climate, the frequent departures from EGPRSP
policies have dented investors’ confidence in the government’s commitment to
market-based policies. The current favorable external conditions provide an ideal
opportunity for a renewed effort to boost private investment and growth, but also
carry the risk of easing pressure for reform.
A. Macroeconomic Outlook

13.
The short-term outlook remains favorable, but inflation risks are on the upside.
Regional growth should remain robust, and remittances are unlikely to dry up in the
immediate future. GDP growth is projected to moderate to 5 percent in 2005, as consumption
growth slows down. The disinflation under way since October 2003 appears to have stalled
in late-2004, making the authorities’ end-year inflation target (10 percent) hard to reach.
Their inflation target for 2005 (8-10 percent) is relatively ambitious against the background
of a tightening labor market, an expansionary fiscal stance, and continued foreign exchange
inflows. On current trends, remittances should continue to boost imports and push up the leu
and, as a result, the trade deficit is unlikely to improve. Downside risks to the outlook relate
to Moldova’s lingering vulnerability to adverse weather conditions and external shocks,
including a slowdown in Russia and in the EU, which are the main destinations for
Moldova’s exports of goods and labor.
14.
Medium-term prospects are subject to greater uncertainty. Staff argued that, without
acceleration of structural reforms and an appropriate fiscal adjustment, the current economic
expansion was likely to be short-lived. In particular, without a visible improvement in the
business environment and a slowdown of emigration, a strong supply response was unlikely
to materialize. The authorities, by contrast, maintained that Moldova’s buoyant growth was
broadly the result of their policies and their selective approach to Fund advice, and did not
see merit in changing course. They acknowledged, however, that growth was below potential
and that remittances should be channeled into business investment, but they also recalled that
the current consumption and housing booms were to be expected under conditions of
repressed demand.
15.
To illustrate the medium-term options and their implications, staff prepared two
scenarios: a baseline scenario, assuming unchanged policies and based on the authorities’
fiscal and monetary plans, and an alternative scenario, consistent with bolder structural
reforms and a tighter fiscal stance (Table 6). The scenarios were designed to contrast two
alternative fiscal strategies, with monetary policy targeting the same inflation path—a task
facilitated by supportive fiscal policy under the alternative scenario.
16.
Under the baseline scenario, GDP growth would decelerate to 3 percent by 2007. On
the demand side, the impulse to growth provided by the post-1998 surge in remittances is
expected to taper off, as these inflows stabilize and consumer spending levels off. With
private domestic demand expansion moderating, inflation and current account pressures
should ease somewhat. Under current and projected fiscal trends, financing gaps of

- 20 -

0.9-2.4 percent of GDP would emerge during 2005-07, in all likelihood financed through
further accumulation of external arrears. Beyond the exogenous risks noted earlier, the
possibility that current expansionary policies will ignite inflation is one of the major risks to
the outlook. Moreover, a continued real appreciation of the leu may stem the growth of
manufacturing and agro-processing exports. Finally, the public treasury remains vulnerable
to revenue shortfalls, raising the risk of disruptive fiscal adjustment or accumulation of
arrears.
17.
The alternative scenario envisages the implementation of a strong and credible
structural reform program, underpinned by tighter financial policies. To close fiscal
financing gaps, primary expenditure growth should be constrained to 14 percent, against the
16.3 percent increase in the baseline (Table 6 and Figure 8).9 This could be achieved through
better targeting and expenditure rationalization—notably in social programs and education—
and more gradual adjustments in wages and pensions. These measures would allow Moldova
to fully service its current external debt obligations, but would still leave the arrears issue
unresolved. The medium-term fiscal stance could be relaxed as the authorities succeed in
mobilizing external financing; any additional resources could be used to reduce the
government's debt to the NBM, partially clear external arrears, or boost spending in priority
areas.
B. Fiscal Policy and Reform
18.
The fiscal stance is set to loosen in 2005. The 2005 state budget, approved by
Parliament in November 2004, along with a decision to raise pensions by a minimum of
25 percent, point to a general government deficit of 2.5 percent of GDP (Text Table 3). Staff
argued that fiscal policy should be tightened for several reasons. First, without fresh
financing, the expansionary
stance implies continuing buildup

government to resume debt payments to the NBM (see paragraph 27).

This would still make room for 4.2 percent real expenditure growth in 2005.

19.
The authorities argued that their fiscal plans realistically reflected Moldova’s needs
and priorities. They welcomed staff’s analysis of the fiscal outlook under the alternative
scenario, but saw little room for expenditure compression in the near term given their
poverty-reduction and social objectives. Likewise, full servicing of external debts would
become possible only with resumption of external financing. The authorities did not consider
their fiscal policies inflationary and trusted monetary policy to keep inflation in check. While
shortfalls in privatization receipts were possible, they would be accommodated through
slower repayment of NBM debt. Staff pointed out that, as suggested in the alternative
scenario, expenditure restraint would need to be only temporary and limited in size, still
allowing for real spending growth in 2005. By deferring some spending, the authorities could
close the 2005-07 financing gaps and, with the expected return of external financing,even
make up lost ground.
20.
Revenue performance will depend critically on the continuation of economic growth
and the authorities’ success in expanding the taxable base. While supporting the authorities’
goal to reduce the overall tax burden, staff reiterated that a more gradual approach to tax cuts
would allow time to review their revenue effects.10 Furthermore, tax rate cuts should be
accompanied by measures to broaden the tax base, notably eliminating VAT exemptions and
domestic zero-rating, and simplifying VAT administration. Against that background, the
recently introduced exemptions for VAT and profit taxes for new domestic investment are a
step in the wrong direction, although they establish a level-playing field with foreign
investors. While the authorities feel that recent income tax performance confirms that
previous cuts helped draw a sufficient number of firms into the tax net to offset revenue
losses from lower rates, analysis of available data is inconclusive. Furthermore, gains from
additional tax cuts are likely to become smaller, as the share of non-reporting firms
declines.11 Moreover, the projected revenue increases for the Social Fund (28 percent) and
the Health Fund (24 percent) in 2005 might be optimistic given the projection of wage bill
growth (18 percent). An additional risk to the revenue outlook is the heavy reliance on VAT
(estimated at 37 percent of total tax revenue in 2004), implying high sensitivity to changes in
consumer spending and imports.
21.
Expenditure plans for 2005 entail a significant increase in consolidated primary
spending. This reflects the authorities’ intention to direct more resources to the social sector,
agriculture, transportation, and communications. The November 2004 pension hike will have
a negative impact on Social Fund sustainability. While in 2004 the hike was financed by
savings in other social benefit payments and a drawdown in bank balances, starting from
2005 the authorities may have to tap the reserve fund. The authorities recognize the need for
Social Fund reform, including broadening the contribution base and lowering rates. Staff

- 23 -

cautioned that future changes in benefits should factor in the potential impact of emigration
on the contribution base, and should go hand in hand with adjustments in contributions to
ensure the Social Fund’s long-term viability.
22.
Working toward effective expenditure management, realistic revenue projections, and
a more efficient tax administration are the key fiscal challenges over the medium term. The
overall size and composition of public spending should become more closely aligned to the
country’s development needs, calling for better prioritization, and more effectiveness and
efficiency in public services delivery. This could require a review of the role and optimal size
of the government, with current

23.
The authorities explained that their medium-term spending plans reflected the high
social demand for government spending and unsustainably low wages in education and
health care. The consolidated government wage bill is projected to increase by 44 percent in
2004–07, largely as a result of the alignment of wage scales within the government sector.
Staff emphasized that it was essential to consider wage policy in conjunction with civil
service reform. The authorities acknowledged that the public administration was not
sufficiently adapted to the requirements of a market economy and confirmed their intention
to implement a civil service reform, as envisaged in the EGPRSP.
24.
There has been appreciable improvement in fiscal planning and budget elaboration. In
line with ROSC recommendations, fiscal transparency was enhanced by integrating income
from special funds and donor-financed projects into the budget. Equally important, the 2005
expenditure plans were based on the 2005–07 medium-term expenditure framework. The
launch of the Health Fund in 2004 offers a basis for greater financial accountability in health
care management, but its performance needs to be monitored closely, in particular given the
high uncertainty about the amount of contributions from non-salaried subscribers.

C. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
25.
While recognizing that the NBM has to balance different, sometimes conflicting,
policy objectives, staff reiterated that monetary policy should assign priority to fighting
inflation. Staff advised tightening monetary policy to stem inflationary pressures and bring
inflation down to single digits in the medium term. The NBM acknowledged the risks of a
pickup in inflation and stepped up its sterilization efforts in recent months. Moreover, NBM
certificates will be used as a new liquidity management tool in 2005. Staff welcomed the
more intense use of monetary policy instruments but argued that a more determined emphasis
on low inflation would also require a willingness to allow the leu to appreciate further in the
face of strong demand. At the same time, staff agreed with the NBM that, given Moldova’s
vulnerability to external shocks and its external debt obligations, some precautionary
accumulation of reserves (from the current low levels of about 2 months of imports) would
be appropriate, as long as it did not jeopardize the inflation objective.

26.
While receptive to these arguments, the NBM appears to be under increasing political
pressure to keep the leu stable. Indeed, following intensified government criticism of the
NBM’s exchange rate policy in early November, the leu/dollar exchange rate stabilized
remarkably (Figure 10). These developments seem to question the NBM’s de facto
independence and go against its

urged the NBM to restrict its
interventions to smoothing short-term exchange rate fluctuations. Despite the recent
appreciation, the exchange rate seems still somewhat undervalued, and external
competitiveness appears adequate. Going forward, a more flexible exchange rate policy,
capable of absorbing external shocks, appears appropriate for Moldova.
27.
Staff stressed the importance of supportive government policies to underpin monetary
and exchange rate policies. First and foremost, market-oriented structural policies would be
instrumental to enhance long-run competitiveness and encourage an efficient allocation of
workers’ remittances. Importantly, a stronger fiscal effort during the next couple of years
would allow the government to service its external debt (easing appreciation pressures on the
exchange rate) and to resume debt payments to the NBM (strengthening NBM
independence). Staff advised the authorities to work out a plan to gradually reduce the

- 25 -

government’s debt to the NBM, currently about 8½ of GDP. While the 2005 budget
envisages some repayments, these are contingent on (uncertain) privatization revenues.
D. Financial Sector Issues
28.
A recent FSAP highlighted several weaknesses in the financial sector, including
increasing government influence, opaque ownership structures, and governance issues
arising from the lack of strategic investors.13 The FSAP was well received by the authorities,
and many of its recommendations are likely to be implemented. However, they did not share
staff’s concerns about increasing signs of administrative interference in the financial sector,
including the dominant state role in one of the largest banks, the preferential treatment of the
state-owned insurance company, and the government’s large debt to the NBM. Staff also
noted that the opaque ownership structures of financial institutions and corporations created
risks and complicated the task of banking supervision, while improving the business climate
was crucial to attract foreign investors. The NBM agreed that there were important
ownership issues in the sector but claimed that, in practice, bank supervisors had good
knowledge of banks’ activities. Staff also warned about the potential adverse impact of the
recent credit boom, and encouraged the NBM to adhere to international practice and transfer
profits to the government only once a year, following its annual audit.
E. Structural Policies
29.
Staff argued that a fundamental policy shift was required to re-launch economic
reform in Moldova. Notwithstanding the market-oriented line of the EGPRSP, the current
policy strategy relies excessively on government intervention and regulation, which distort
incentives for private sector development. Behind these policies is a strong belief that the
government has an important role to play in the economy, and that non-market policies can
be justified to meet important social and economic goals. Staff urged the authorities to align
their strategy more closely to the EGPRSP and to speed up its implementation.
30.
Improving the business environment is the key challenge ahead, while structural
reforms need to be accelerated to complete the transition process and strengthen economic
ties with the EU. Staff underscored the importance of simplifying government regulations,
removing opportunities for administrative discretion, and eliminating restrictions to free
trade. It urged the authorities to refrain from granting tax holidays and exemptions to priority
sectors. The Ministry of Economy’s efforts on regulatory reform have met, however, with
strong resistance by some line ministries and agencies.
31.
While the recently approved anti-corruption strategy is a step in the right direction,
effective implementation is crucial to demonstrate ownership. The strategy is the latest in a
series of plans to limit corruption, including those approved in December 2002 and
13

No first-tier banks have set up subsidiaries or branches in Moldova or have become part-owners of
domestic banks (see the accompanying Financial System Stability Assessment).

- 26 -

November 2003. The authorities were encouraged to comply with the ambitious
implementation schedule of the new action plan and set monitoring and reporting
mechanisms to communicate progress in implementation. Staff also underscored the
importance of establishing a clear functional and institutional separation between the
objectives of fighting corruption and fighting “economic crime” (which includes matters
such as tax evasion), both currently pursued by the Center for Fighting Economic Crime and
Corruption. The authorities disagreed with this approach because they view corruption as
intimately tied to economic crime.
F. External Sector Issues
32.
External public debt service will remain a challenge in the near term. Staff stressed
that, although recent agreements and the leu appreciation have reduced the external debt
burden considerably, Moldova still needs to tackle the problem of outstanding arrears and
their continued accumulation. The authorities remarked that they had put their best efforts
into bilateral negotiations. They added that external financing was necessary to resume full
debt service without jeopardizing poverty-reduction and social objectives, and reiterated their
interest in a Fund-supported program to allow a possible Paris Club rescheduling and help
unlock donor assistance. Staff urged the authorities to undertake the necessary fiscal
adjustment to create sufficient room for servicing current debt obligations, while stepping up
structural efforts to remove obstacles to private sector-led growth. Progress in these areas
would help build a track record for possible future Fund financial assistance.
33.
The debt sustainability analysis shows continuing improvement in debt indicators,
although liquidity problems will likely arise in the short term (Appendix V). Nevertheless,
the balance of payments is heavily dependent on the continued inflows of remittances.
Should these dry up, the immediate impact on the exchange rate and the balance of payments
could be significant.
34.
Formally, Moldova’s trade regime is fairly liberal, with a low weighted average tariff
(4.6 percent) and no quantitative restrictions, but de facto restrictions are widespread. Staff
renewed its objection to selective restrictions on exports and imports, including a regulation
requiring that certain agricultural products be exported only through the Commodity
Exchange. It cautioned the authorities against protection of special interests and noncompetitive industries, stressing the benefits of a stable, transparent, and uniform tariff
regime. The authorities did not acknowledge the existence of informal trade restrictions,
noting that their trade policies were consistent with WTO commitments.
G. Technical Assistance
35.
During the past year Moldova benefited from intense IMF technical assistance. Fund
advice has already been incorporated in several areas, including financial and monetary
statistics, the payments system, fiscal transparency, and budget coverage. Several projects
stemming from the FSAP are in the pipeline, including technical assistance on foreign
exchange regulations and monitoring, and the sequencing of possible capital account

- 27 -

liberalization. More generally, there continues to be a strong interest from staff’s technical
counterparts in Fund expertise and advice.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
36.
On balance, Moldova’s recent macroeconomic performance has been satisfactory and
the short-run outlook remains positive. Buoyant regional growth has boosted export
performance, economic recovery has taken hold, and inflation has moderated from the high
levels observed in late-2003. However, the recovery rests on vulnerable foundations. Recent
rapid economic growth owes much to large and rising workers’ remittances. And, while
structural reforms have stalled, a difficult business climate holds back investment. Looking
ahead, the key post-electoral challenge will be to create an environment supportive of private
sector development and foreign investment—both critical conditions for sustained growth,
domestic job creation, and poverty reduction. This would require a radical shift away from
interventionist policies, and a convincing effort to open the country to foreign investment,
while maintaining a liberal trade regime.
37.
Large-scale labor emigration has emerged as an important coping mechanism, with
mixed blessing for Moldovans. On the one hand, emigration generates at least 25-30 percent
of GDP in workers’ remittances, providing a critical safety net to the population, and driving
short-term growth. On the other hand, by depriving Moldova of a large part of its labor force,
emigration will constrain long-term growth. Moreover, remittances may have helped ease
pressure for market reforms. Finally, these inflows have put the leu under strong appreciation
pressure, complicating the task of monetary and exchange rate policy and contributing to a
widening trade deficit.
38.
Pushing the structural reform agenda forward remains the main prerequisite for
sustained economic revival. In particular, steadfast implementation of EGPRSP policies will
serve as a test for the government’s credibility. Without a pickup in the reform momentum
leading to a clear improvement in the business climate, prospects for raising investment will
remain limited, the country will continue to lose working-age population, and remittances
will become an even more prominent source of external financing and social protection. A
major stumbling block to structural reform is, however, corruption. Moldova continues to
rate poorly in this area, and tackling the roots of corruption should be high on the reform
agenda.
39.
While acceleration of structural reforms should be the top priority, adjustments in the
current macroeconomic policy mix are also called for to stem inflationary pressures and
underpin long-term growth. The combination of effective implementation of a credible
structural reform program with tighter short-term financial policies would build the track
record essential to future external financing, including from the Fund.
40.
Fiscal policy should, in the short run, buttress the NBM’s efforts to control inflation,
and, in the medium term, secure sustainable public finances. A tighter short-run fiscal stance
would support monetary and exchange rate policies and help make room for current external

- 28 -

debt service. At the same time, additional external financing could allow for a more relaxed
medium-term stance. Moreover, on the revenue side, continuing improvements in tax
administration should go hand-in-hand with measures to broaden the tax base, including by
removing exemptions. To ensure medium-term fiscal sustainability, budgetary planning
should become more forward-looking, increasing the importance placed on medium-term
expenditure plans, on detailed analysis of longer-term implications of spending decisions,
and on realistic revenue projections.
41.
Monetary policy should place greater emphasis on the inflation objective. Against the
background of an expansionary fiscal stance, rapid credit growth, and strong foreign
currency inflows, the NBM should tighten its stance to counteract rising inflationary
pressures. While recent efforts to sterilize remittances inflows are encouraging and the
buildup of reserves from low levels is desirable, the NBM should let the exchange rate
appreciate if these inflows continue to grow rapidly. More generally, going forward, a more
flexible exchange rate policy would serve Moldova well in absorbing possible external
shocks, particularly from terms of trade and remittances.
42.
Despite Moldova’s relatively open statutory trade regime, the promise of export-led
growth remains constrained by de facto trade restrictions and high business costs. Moreover,
although trade with the EU has gathered pace, exports are still concentrated in a few
commodities and markets. Improving and maintaining long-term competitiveness calls for
removing impediments to trade and accelerating structural reforms.
43.
While financial sector indicators are largely positive, existing vulnerabilities in the
financial sector need to be addressed. Of particular importance are efforts to reduce the
government’s role and administrative interference in the sector, allowing for increased
competition. Together with the recent credit boom, the opaque ownership structures of
financial institutions and corporations creates risks to the sector, requiring intensive

44.
The authorities’ recent external debt negotiations have met with significant success.
Along with currency appreciation, the recent restructuring and reschedulings have alleviated
the external debt service burden and improved the debt profile. The resumption of interest
payments to Paris Club creditors is an important step toward normalizing the debt situation,
but the outstanding arrears still need to be tackled. External creditors will be looking for a
credible change in economic policies before committing to debt relief.
45.
Moldova’s official statistics are provided on a timely basis and are generally adequate
for surveillance and program monitoring. Some shortcomings still remain, notably regarding
price and national accounts statistics. The authorities have made good use of technical
assistance from the Fund and are encouraged to build on the progress achieved to date.
46.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation be held within the regular
12-month cycle.

Disbursements made after November 28, 2000—with the exception of disbursements of
emergency assistance and loans from the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility—are
expected to be repaid on the expectations schedule. Countries may request the IMF
Executive Board to make repayments according to the obligations schedule if their external
payments position is not strong enough to meet the repayment expectations without undue
hardship or risk. Please note: Repayments under the Supplemental Reserve Facility are
scheduled to be repaid on the expectations schedule.

APPENDIX I

Safeguards Assessments:

Under the Fund's safeguards assessment policy, the National Bank of Moldova (NBM) was
subject to a full safeguards assessment with respect to the PRGF Arrangement that expired
on December 20, 2003. The safeguards assessment was completed on June 12, 2002, and
determined that the NBM's procedures and controls to manage resources, including IMF
disbursements, were not adequate in all areas of the IMF's safeguards framework. Therefore,
specific remedial actions to address identified vulnerabilities were recommended to the
authorities and all priority measures identified have been implemented.
VIII.

Exchange Arrangement:

Moldova’s exchange rate regime was reclassified to managed floating with no preannounced path for the exchange rate on June 30, 2002; previously it was classified as
independently floating.
Prior to the introduction of the Moldovan leu on November 29, 1993, the Russian ruble
(supplemented by NBM-issued ruble denominated coupons) was the legal tender in
Moldova. The government introduced the leu at a conversion rate of one leu equal to
1,000 Moldovan rubles and an exchange rate of one dollar equal to lei 3.85. The leu
remained broadly stable around MDL 4.75/$ until mid-October 1998. It has since depreciated
against the dollar and traded at MDL 12.46=$1 on December 31, 2004.
Foreign exchange was initially traded on the Chişinău Interbank Foreign Currency Exchange
(CIFCE). Operations of the CIFCE started at the beginning of 1993, and daily auctions
commenced in early February 1995. An active foreign exchange cash market exists within
authorized banks and foreign exchange bureaus. From November 16, 1993 through endOctober 1998, the U.S. dollar exchange rate established in the CIFCE was the official
exchange rate quoted by the NBM. Since November 2, 1998, the official rate as announced
by the NBM is determined as the weighted average of all daily market transactions. The
NBM quotes exchange rates of the leu for other currencies on the basis of the leu-U.S. dollar
rate and the cross-rate relationships between the U.S. dollar and the currencies concerned in
the international market.
IX.

Article IV Consultation:

Moldova is on a 12-month consultation cycle. The last Article IV consultation was concluded
on January 26, 2004 (Country Reports No. 04/39, and No. 04/40).
X.

FSAP Participation:

Moldova received an FSAP mission in May 2004; the FSSA will be presented to the Board at
the time of the 2004 Article IV discussions.

APPENDIX I

Use of Fund Resources:

On February 4, 1993, Moldova purchased Fund resources totaling SDR 13.5 million,
equivalent to 15 percent of quota under the Compensatory and Contingency Financing
Facilities (CCFF). This was followed by a first drawing under the Systemic Transformation
Facility (STF) of SDR 22.5 million, equivalent to 25 percent of quota, which was approved
by the Board on September 16, 1993. On December 17, 1993, the Board approved a purchase
of Fund resources under a stand-by arrangement (SBA) in the amount of SDR 51.75 million
and the drawing of the second tranche of the STF totaling SDR 22.5 million. On
December 19, 1994, Moldova made a second purchase under the CCFF totaling
SDR 12.2 million, equivalent to 13.5 percent of quota, in conjunction with the second review
of the SBA that expired at end-March 1995. The Board approved a successor SBA for
Moldova in an amount totaling SDR 58.05 million (equivalent to 65 percent of quota) on
March 22, 1995 (Press Release No. 95/15, 3/22/95). Three purchases, totaling
SDR 32.4 million (equivalent to 36 percent of quota), were made under the arrangement. An
Extended Arrangement amounting to SDR 135 million (equivalent to 150 percent of old
quota) was approved by the Executive Board on May 20, 1996 (Press Release No. 96/25,
5/20/06). At the time of the third review, the program was extended by one year to May 19,
2000. While the fourth review was completed (www.imf.org), the program expired on
May 19, 2000 without the completion of the scheduled last review because parliament
rejected twice an important program condition. Five purchases totaling SDR 87.5 million
(equivalent to 97 percent of old quota) were made under the EFF arrangement. A PRGF
arrangement was approved on December 21, 2000 (News Brief No. 00/122, 12/21/00) in the
amount of SDR 110.88 million (equivalent to 90 percent of quota). SDR 9.24 million was
disbursed on December 29, 2000, followed by SDR 9.24 million on February 23, 2001, and
SDR 9.24 million on July 26, 2002. The arrangement expired in December 2003 with only
one review completed.

MOLDOVA—IMF-WORLD BANK RELATIONS
(As of November 30, 2004)
Country Director: Mr. Paul Bermingham

Telephone: +380 44 490 06671

A. Partnership in Moldova’s Development Strategy
1.
The government and other major stakeholders consider poverty reduction to be the
major development challenge facing Moldova. The government has welcomed the PRSP
process as the primary mechanism for orienting and coordinating government and
development partner activities. An Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP) was
presented to the Boards of the IMF and IDA in December 2000. The change in government
in March 2001, however, delayed progress towards the full PRSP. The new government
submitted an updated I-PRSP and PRSP Preparation Status Report to the Boards of the IMF
and IDA in April 2002. The Joint Staff Assessment at that time noted that the delay was
understandable and concluded that progress on the development of the full PRSP was
satisfactory and provided a sound basis for continued access to concessional assistance.
2.
Since then, the government has completed a full PRSP, calling it - the Economic
Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (EGPRSP) to emphasize the centrality of
growth to poverty reduction. The EGPRSP, which was adopted by the government in May
2004, describes the participatory process underpinning the development of the strategy,
provides a diagnostic of poverty, and presents sector programs and policy measures for
sustainable economic growth and poverty reduction. The Joint Staff Advisory Note assessing
the EGPRSP was discussed by the Boards of the World Bank and the IMF in
November 2004.
3.
The IMF has taken the lead in assisting Moldova in promoting and maintaining
macroeconomic stability through prudent monetary and financial policies. In this regard the
Fund has encouraged the Moldovan authorities to implement a policy reform agenda that
would attract the needed level of concessional foreign financing from bilateral and
multilateral creditors and encourage the international community to reschedule Moldova’s
external debt to enhance debt sustainability. The Fund has supported Moldova’s economic
reform program since 1993. A three-year program under the PRGF facility was approved in
December 2000. The first PRGF review was not completed until Mid-2002 as a result of
disruptions stemming from a change in government in early 2001. Several attempts to
complete the second review have failed owing to the incomplete implementation of agreed
actions. The program expired at the end of 2003, leaving ¾ of the available funds
undisbursed.
4.
The World Bank has taken the lead in the policy dialogue on a number of structural
issues relevant to economic growth and poverty reduction, including private sector
development, infrastructure, social protection, and agricultural sector reforms. A range of

- 43 -

APPENDIX II

instruments is used to conduct this dialogue. Since 1994, three structural adjustment
operations have been carried out, which aimed at supporting structural reforms in the areas of
financial discipline, cash privatization, de-monopolization and privatization of the energy
sector and telecom, and urban and rural land markets. The First Structural Adjustment Loan
($60 million) was approved in December 1994. The Second Structural Adjustment Loan and
Credit ($100 million, of which IDA credit of $45 million) was approved in 1997. The third
tranche was cancelled and replaced with a $40 million Structural Adjustment Credit
(approved on June 24, 1999). The second tranche of the SAC was accompanied by a
$10 million budget support grant from the Dutch Government. A supplement of $5 million
was disbursed in December 2001 to help the government fill a financial gap created by ice
storm damages of November 2000. A Third Structural Adjustment Credit ($30 million) was
approved in June 2002. Lack of progress in structural reforms resulted in the credit expiring
in September 2003 with 2/3 of the credit undisbursed. Adjustment operations have been
combined with sector projects in rural finance, energy, agriculture, environment, health,
education, social protection and private sector development. Recent analytical work of the
Bank includes A Public Expenditure Management Review, an Investment Climate
Assessment, a Country Procurement Assessment Review, a Country Financial Accountability
Assessment, a Trade Diagnostic Study and the second Poverty Assessment.
5.
The next section describes the Bank program and the division of responsibility
between the two institutions. In a number of areas—social sectors, environment,
infrastructure—the Bank takes the lead in the dialogue and there was no cross conditionality
in the IMF-supported program. The Bank also is leading the dialogue on private sector
development and agricultural sector reform and Bank analysis serves as input into the Fund
program. In other areas—trade and customs reform, financial sector policies, public sector
management—both institutions work together and share conditionality. Finally, in areas like
fiscal, monetary, and exchange rate policies, and tax administration, the IMF takes the lead
with little Bank involvement.
B. IMF-World Bank Collaboration in Specific Areas
Areas in which the World Bank leads
6.
Areas in which the Bank leads the policy dialogue are social sectors, infrastructure,
and environment. In the social sphere, the Bank has carried out Poverty Assessments to
monitor and evaluate progress in alleviating poverty. A second poverty assessment has
recently been completed . A Social Protection Management Project supports the
implementation of comprehensive reform of the public pension system and the introduction
of a regulatory framework for private pension funds. The project also supports the
implementation of the new organizational structure for social insurance. The Bank has also
supported a Social Investment Fund Project to assist in the building of local community and
municipal capacity and skills through the rehabilitation of social infrastructure. The fund also
focuses on improving the delivery of social services, creating short-term employment and
opportunities in rural areas by financing small-scale public works and supporting micro-

- 44 -

APPENDIX II

business development. A second Social Investment Fund Project was approved by the
Bank’s board in June 2004.
7.
In health, the Bank is focusing on improving the allocation of resources to ensure a
more equitable and efficient orientation of healthcare resources to enable the government
achieve a better utilization of finances and to appropriately meet the health needs of the
population. The ongoing Health Investment Fund Project is focused on improving the health
status of the Moldovan population and increasing the quality and efficiency of public health
services by improving access to essential services by the poor. The Moldova TB/AIDS
Control Project aims at improving Moldova’s health status and assists in achieving the
health-related Millennium Development Goals by reducing mortality, morbidity, and
transmission of HIV/AIDs.
8.
In education, the General Education Project supports the introduction of new
general education standards. It develops, tests and implements: a new curricula; teaching
materials; textbooks; teaching methodology; and teacher training. The technical assistance
activity, Reconciliation Through General Education in the Transnistria Region, addresses
the issue of access to mother tongue education through the rehabilitation of school
infrastructure in schools affected by military conflict and promotes reconciliation and
integration of communities separated by civil strife.
9.
With regards to infrastructure development, the Bank is concentrating on upgrading
basic utility services impacting the population at large and the poor in particular. The Energy
II Project has two main components: (i) power system infrastructure—investments to
upgrade and rehabilitate metering, dispatch and communications, selected priority
rehabilitation of the electricity of the electricity transmission network, and institutional
development and regulation of the electricity market; and (ii) heating supply and
consumption—investments in improving heating supply and energy efficiency in selected
public buildings. A Pilot Water Supply and Sanitation Project is aimed at enhancing the
welfare of the population living in some of the poorest rural areas and medium-sized towns
and cities by improving the quality, efficiency, and sustainability of water supply and
sanitation services by rehabilitating and improving operations of selected water and sewage
systems to increase service quality and efficiency, improving the financial viability and
commercial practices of the participating utilities, and involving the private sector in the
sector.
10.
The Bank has supported a number of environmental projects. The Agriculture
Pollution Control Project focuses on significantly increasing the use of environmentally
friendly agricultural practices by farmers and agro-industry thereby reducing nutrient
discharge from agricultural sources into the Danube River and Black Sea. A number of
technical assistance activities are also under implementation. A Biodiversity Strategy
Development is assisting the government in implementing Articles 6 and 8 of the Convention
on Biological Diversity. The project also supports the formulation and adoption of strategies
and actions for the protection and sustainable use of bio-diversity, through a participatory

- 45 -

APPENDIX II

process involving the public and private sectors and local NGOs. Similarly, the Biodiversity
Conservation Project addresses existing national environmental priorities of improved water
quality and habitat management on the Nistru River.
11.
In the area of rural and agricultural development, the Bank’s First Cadastre
Project has initiated the first cadastre, implemented a rural land registration system, and
helped develop the institutional framework to complete and manage the legal cadastre in
urban areas. The project helped establish a system of clear and enforceable ownership rights
so as to promote the privatization of land the development of real markets in Moldova. The
Rural Investment and Services Project increases rural incomes and living standards by
promoting rural entrepreneurship, agricultural production, economic diversification, and
trade in the rural areas. The project provides public investment support to alleviate key
institutional constraints in farmer’s group formation, supporting development of marketing
institutions and infrastructure for improved access to input and output markets, and
developing a rural advisory service. The project also provides investment and working
capital at commercial terms to support a broad range of agribusiness. A Supplement to the
Rural Investment and Services Project was made effective in August 2004.
12.
While the Bank has taken the lead in the areas described above, the IMF has a strong
interest in these areas since many of these reforms are critical to achieving macroeconomic
stabilization and enhancing growth prospects. Accordingly, there is a high degree of
consultation and coordination between the two institutions on these matters.
Areas of shared responsibility
13.

The Bank and Fund are working jointly in a number of areas:

14.
Private Sector Development. While substantial progress in improving Moldova’s
business environment has been made, a challenging reform agenda remains. Both the Bank
and the Fund have focused on this agenda in their assistance programs, including SAC III
and PRGF and the surveillance exercise. The Bank has undertaken a number of studies,
including the Investment Climate Assessment, the Business Environment and Enterprise
Performance Survey (together with EBRD), a Diagnostic Review of the Environment for
Foreign Investment, and a number of Costs of Doing Business Surveys, to gauge ongoing
developments in this area and determine the most important impediments to private sector
development. The Bank’s Private Sector Development II Project strengthens the
competitiveness of private and public enterprises in Moldova through the hands-on training
of local managers abroad (human capital investment) and creation of a Competitiveness
Center (market information and benchmarking). The IFC has promoted financial sector
development by extending credit lines to a number of private banks for on-lending to private
sector. The Fund has focused on policies needed to maintain a stable macroeconomic
environment and remove obstacles to growth, thus encouraging private sector activities. The
PRGF program included a number of structural benchmarks that focused on promoting a
liberal trade regime and eliminating excessive state intervention in the economy. A number

- 46 -

APPENDIX II

of technical assistance missions have been undertaken to improve banking legislation and
banking supervision, including the joint Financial Sector Assessment Program.
15.
In the area of Public Sector Management, the Bank’s Public Economic
Management Review, Country Procurement Assessment Review and Country Financial
Accountability Assessment examine fiscal adjustment and reform efforts in the social sectors
and suggest policy measures to strengthen public expenditure management and actions
needed to build capacity for increased government effectiveness. The Bank’s project, Trade
and Transportation Facilitation in Southeast Europe (part of the Stability Pact initiative),
aims to strengthen and modernize the Customs Administration and other border control
agencies with the objective reducing non-tariff costs to trade and transport and preventing
smuggling and corruption at border crossings. The Fund has also provided technical
assistance to improve custom and administration, government financial statistics, and public
expenditure policies.
Areas in which the IMF leads
16.
The Fund takes the lead in the formulation and execution of fiscal and monetary
policies, external policies, and issues involving economic and financial statistics. In the
budgetary area, the Fund leads the dialogue on fiscal matters, taking the lead on tax policy
and reforms.
17.
In these areas the Bank takes into account the policy recommendations of the IMF
and ensures that its own policy advice is consistent.
C. The World Bank Group Strategy
18.
The Bank’s last full Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for the period 1999 to 2001
was discussed by the Bank’s Board in May 1999. The Bank had initially planned to prepare a
full CAS for Board discussion in FY02 but decided to wait until Moldova’s full PRSP was
ready to ensure that the two documents were fully consistent. In the interim, the Bank
presented a CAS Progress Report for the period 2002–2003 to its Board June 2002. The
Bank has developed a full CAS for the period FY04-FY08. The main objective of the new
CAS is to support the implementation of the government’s EGPRSP and capitalize on the
gains of previous assistance programs. Board presentation of the new CAS took place in
December 2004.

APPENDIX III

MOLDOVA—RELATIONS WITH THE EBRD
(As of November 30, 2004)
The EBRD’s strategy in Moldova is aimed primarily at supporting private sector
development in the country, and increased policy dialogue with the authorities. The EBRD is
providing support to (i) the financial sector through credit lines, the participation in the
equity of local banks, expansion of its trade facilitation program, and the provision of new
financial products, such as leasing and mortgage financing; (ii) private enterprises through
credit lines and co-financing with local banks, offering privatization and post-privatization
support, and the expansion of programs that provide advisory services; and (iii) public
utilities with a special focus on improvement of the regulatory and operational environment.
In the context of implementing Moldova’s Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction
Strategy, the Bank is working with other institutions in increasing its policy dialogue with
the authorities on improving the business climate in the country. The EBRD’s Early
Transition Coutnry (ETC) Initiative, announced in June 2004, is directed toward seven
countries, including Moldova, where post-Soviet transition from command to market
economies and democracies has been slowest.
To date the total value of projects supported in Moldova, in whole or in part, amounts to
around €280 million.
Thirty two projects have been signed totaling €165 million of EBRD resources, including: (i)
a wine export promotion project, which is targeting the main Moldovan wineries and glass
producer, through restructuring of the sector (€23.6 million) and equity investment into a
glass producer (€6.4 million); (ii) an energy efficiency project for upgrading the heating
distribution networks in Chisinau (€7.5 million); (iii) several credit lines and equity
investment for Moldova-Agroindbank for on-lending to small and medium enterprises
(€28 million in total); (iv) several credit lines and equity investment for Victoria Bank
(€9.9 million in total); (v) a project for linking Moldovan satellite earth stations to the
Eurovision Network (€0.8 million); (vi) a road rehabilitation loan (€9 million); (vii) partial
financing for construction of a new oil terminal at Giurgulesti (€9.1 million); (viii) credit
facilities for micro enterprises through four local banks (€2.5 million); (ix) rehabilitating
Chisinau’s water services (€16.5 million); (x) Chisinau Airport Modernization (€7 million);
(xi) trade facilitation program for Victoriabank, Moldova-Agroindbank, Moldindconbank,
and Mobiasbanca (regional TFP - €8.3 million in total); (xii) equity participation in and a
loan to the micro-lending company (€2 million); and (xiii) equity participation and loan
financing for three privatized power distribution companies (€25.6 million).
In addition to banking projects, some 65 Technical Cooperation projects have been
completed or approved (totaling €10.5 million).

APPENDIX IV

MOLDOVA—STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Although generally adequate for surveillance and program monitoring, Moldova’s
official statistics still have shortcomings, especially regarding the national accounts and price
statistics. The lack of an updated census also hampers statistical analysis in several areas.
Data for monitoring macroeconomic developments are provided by the Moldovan authorities
in a timely manner (see attached matrix). Moldova is a participant in the GDDS. In
December 2004 the Moldovan authorities requested a ROSC Data Module mission in 2005.
2.
National accounts statistics are prepared in accordance with the 1993 SNA
methodology. Estimates do not include the Transnistria region for which data have not been
collected since 1991. GDP is estimated from the production and the expenditure sides, on
both an annual and quarterly basis. The data are prepared in current and constant (previousyear) prices, and annual data are revised—in two stages—as updated information becomes
available. However, the quarterly data remain unadjusted, thus limiting their consistency
with the revised annual data. Overall, the national accounts statistics need improvement in
the following areas: (i) compiling annual and quarterly GDP in constant prices; (ii)
benchmarking the annual and the quarterly data; and (iii) estimating the consumption of
fixed capital in line with international standards.
3.
Price statistics still have various shortcomings. Price collection for the CPI and PPI
is limited geographically and missing data are not imputed following a standard procedure.
The weights of the CPI basket, which currently are derived primarily from the Household
Budget Survey, need to be improved to represent all segments of the population.
4.
Labor market statistics remain inadequate for analyzing macroeconomic
developments: (i) unemployment data following ILO methodology are not available; and
(ii) wage data do not include fringe benefits, which form an important part of workers’
compensation.
5.
Fiscal statistics. A 1999 GFS statistical mission assisted the authorities in resolving
data issues and provided technical assistance in the classification of accounts. Mission
recommendations that still need to be implemented are: (i) improving the consolidation of
general government data; (ii) reclassifying the financing data by type of debt holder and by
type of debt instrument; and (iii) reporting by the MoF to STA for inclusion in International
Financial Statistics of discrete monthly fiscal data, based on correspondent accounts at the
National Bank of Moldova (NBM). In addition, World Bank technical assistance was
provided to improve the budgetary reports of local authorities as well as the Social Fund. The
authorities reported data in the GFSM 2001 format for publication in the 2003 GFS Yearbook
which could not be published due to serious data issues. Data reported for publication in the
2004 GFS Yearbook still have problems, but can be published.
6.
Balance of payments. The compilation methodology follows the fifth edition of the
Balance of Payments Manual. Date problems that remain relate to the: (i) under-reporting of
imports and exports; (ii) collection of data on services; (iii) measurement of private capital

- 49 -

APPENDIX IV

inflows, including direct investment data; and (iv) treatment of transactions with
Transnistria. Moldova disseminates quarterly data on its international investment position.
7.
Money and banking statistics have improved, following a series of technical
assistance missions from the Fund. A new chart of accounts for the National Bank of
Moldova (NBM) was introduced in 1996 and commercial banks adopted a new chart of
accounts and moved to the International Accounting Standards (IAS) with effect from
January l, 1998. The monetary and financial statistics mission in April 2004 found that, while
monetary data were broadly in line with international statistical standards and of a generally
good quality, shortcomings remained in the compilation of some monetary aggregates.
Therefore, in order to improve the analytical quality of monetary data compiled by the NBM,
the mission made recommendations on several methodological issues, especially (1) the
definition of money and monetary base; (2) the treatment of nonoperating banks; (3) foreign
assets and foreign liabilities of the NBM; (4) the valuation of government securities; and (5)
the classification of shares and other equity. The mission also advised that the balance sheets
of other financial corporations should be periodically reviewed and, if necessary, the
institutional coverage of monetary data should be expanded to include those financial
institutions that may collect deposits or issue deposit substitutes.

APPENDIX V

MOLDOVA—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
D. Background
47.
Total external debt (public plus private, including energy arrears) declined in 2004,
notably in terms of GDP. This decline is mainly a consequence of the sharp real appreciation of
the leu. For end-2004, total external debt is estimated at about $1,635 million, compared to
$1,752 million at end-2003, or 63 percent of GDP at end-2004, compared to 90 percent at end2003 (Table 1a). External debt service indicators have also improved. As exports grew rapidly in
2004, the NPV of debt-to-export ratio is estimated to have fallen to 102 percent at end-2004,
compared to 138 percent at end-2003.
48.
Total public external debt stock was also reduced thanks to buybacks and rescheduling
agreements. The most significant agreement (in May 2004) was with Gazprom, involving the
buyback of promissory notes with a face value of $114.5 million for a cash payment of about $50
million, financed by the NBM. The authorities also finalized a buyback with Hewlett-Packard and
agreed on a rescheduling with Romania and the Export Credit Bank of Turkey. As the leu
appreciated significantly in real terms in 2004, the reduction of debt as a share of GDP was more
dramatic. At end-2004 public and publicly-guaranteed (PPG) debt including the IMF was about
$930 million or 36½ percent of GDP (compared to about 50 percent at end-2003) (Table 2a).
49.
Public domestic debt increased by 1 percentage point to about 11½ percent of GDP in
2004, mainly due to a large loan from the NBM to finance the Gazprom buyback operation. The
government is planning to start paying pack that loan in 2005 with only limited net-issuance of Tbills on the open market, which would lead to a gradual decline of public domestic debt in terms
of GDP.
E. Outlook
50.
Moldova seems to face more of a liquidity problem than a structural debt sustainability
problem. Under the baseline scenario, as described in section IIA, debt indicators would continue
to improve. By 2012, public debt service would have reached 4 percent of exports, down by 4½
percentage points from 2004. To gauge the robustness of the baseline scenario results, stress tests
were conducted. These did not alter the general conclusion from the baseline scenario (Tables 1b
and 2b, and Figures 1 and 2).
51.
Nevertheless, the government faces a serious liquidity problem in the next few years.
Renewed involvement by IFIs, leading to additional financing in the form of concessional loans
and grants, and possibly further debt rescheduling would make it easier to close projected
financing gaps. Although in the debt sustainability analysis financing gaps are assumed to be
financed by external borrowing, the results suggest that debt indicators would still improve in the
medium-term.

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline, while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.

Statement by Jeroen Kremers, Executive Director for Republic of Moldova
February 7, 2005

The Moldovan authorities appreciate the staff report and the accompanying Selected
Issues paper, which reflect the open dialogue between staff and the government and give an
accurate account of economic developments in the country and the challenges ahead. This
Board discussion on the 2004 Article IV Consultation is important to shape views on the
possible reengagement of a new PRGF arrangement. The authorities attach great value to a
program relationship with the Fund, not only because it may pave the way to the Paris Club
and unlock donor financing, but also because it is vital for enhancing domestic and
international credibility and investor confidence. I would like to transmit the readiness and
willingness expressed by the Moldovan authorities to enter into a new agreement with the
IMF during the year 2005, that can contribute to bringing their economy to international
standards, in line with market practices and also with their intention to move towards joining
the European Union.
Medium- and long-term development goals, as well as the strategy to achieve them
are set out in the Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (EGPRSP), which
the Executive Board considered to be a comprehensive document containing crucial steps for
attaining sustainable growth and reducing poverty. The authorities acknowledge that major
changes in economic and social policies are critical for that purpose, and in the EGPRSP they
express their commitment to prudent macro management and a sound reform agenda. The
implementation of the strategy has been slow so far, but its pace is likely to pick up after the
parliamentary and presidential elections, scheduled for early spring.
Growth
Macroeconomic developments in 2004 were favorable. Growth was robust at
7.3 percent. Inflation, although exceeding the projected rate of 10 percent, exhibited a
downward trend. Export growth was strong, international reserves expanded considerably
reaching USD 470 million compared to USD 302 million in 2003, and investments, both
domestic and foreign, increased.
Moldova’s growth strategy puts special emphasis on revitalizing agriculture - the
sector that employs more than 40 percent of the workforce, accounts for about 20 percent of
GDP and 60 percent of exports, but currently operates at only half of its capacity. In line with
the commitments made in the EGPRSP to increase efficiency and expand agricultural output
by creating a favorable environment for the sector and promoting reforms, the authorities
have recently launched a new € 2.8 billion program “Moldovan Village”. Its goal is to
support development and improve the quality of life in rural areas over the next decade. The
program calls for rehabilitation and upgrade of infrastructure, water and natural gas supply,
development of small and medium-sized businesses, restoration of vineyards and the food
processing industry, and environmental protection. This is an ambitious plan, and the
authorities are likely to seek financial and technical assistance from the international
community and investors.

-2-

The authorities recognize that the Moldovan economy continues to depend heavily on
worker remittances. It is positive that these raise disposable income and thus provide at least
minimal social protection to many Moldovans; they are also one of the major sources of
foreign currency inflows helping to build up reserves and partially offset the large trade
deficit. On the other hand, remittances fuel liquidity growth and put upward pressure on the
exchange rate, posing difficulties to monetary policy implementation. They may raise the
reservation wage lowering labor participation, and boost consumption and imports more than
domestic capacity and income, and hence raise prices. As a consequence, over-dependence of
the economy on remittances may increase external vulnerability. A useful chapter on
remittances in the Selected Issues paper provides a detailed account of the scope and the
complexity of the issue. The authorities share the staff analysis and recommendations and
intend to address the issue in two ways. First, by enhancing the business climate and making
domestic employment more attractive to so as to reduce incentives for emigration. This is
critically important from the perspective of growth and capacity building since emigration
tends to drain a qualified and skilled labor force. Second, by trying to in part redirect
remittances from consumption to investment so that the large inflows are put also to more
productive use.
Structural issues
A difficult business climate remains the main obstacle to private sector development
and growth. The poverty reduction strategy of Moldova acknowledges that the problems to a
large extent are of a structural nature related to weak governance, corruption and excessive
government regulations. Institutional and structural measures in these areas coupled with the
strengthening of the rule of law are the cornerstone of the authorities’ reform agenda, which
they intend to pursue aggressively throughout 2005 and beyond. Downsizing the government
together with organizational adjustments followed by restructuring of the compensation and
motivation system are considered important measures for attracting professional and highly
qualified staff, increasing efficiency of the civil service, and curbing corruption. Possible
ways of addressing these issues are being discussed. As a first step towards a compact and
streamlined public sector, structural reorganization of the state chancellery has already been
launched and reforms in other branches of the civil service are also planned following the
upcoming elections. As noted in the staff report, a national anti-corruption strategy has been
recently approved, which the authorities are committed to make an effective tool against
power abuse and entrenched vested interests.
The authorities have indicated their intention to break with the past practices of
excessive regulation and state intervention, and to implement market reforms. With the
objective of making Moldova an attractive place for domestic and foreign investments, they
plan to deregulate entrepreneurial activities, simplify business licensing and registration
procedures, streamline the functions of supervisory bodies and promote fair competition. In
this context, as a result of launching the Regulatory Reform in February 2004, the Law on
implementation of the ‘guilliutine’ principle was approved in December 2004. According to
this law, during a 7-month period, all the relevant by-laws are to be revised according to a set
of principles, after which the assessed acts will be included in a special Register. This

-3procedure implies an interaction between the public and private sector, as well as the
participation of the society. As a result, the necessary prerequisites for the optimization of the
core legislation and of the institutional system of the authorities in charge of regulating the
entrepreneurial activity are being set up. The new mechanism and the principles of
entrepreneurial activity’s regulation will be incorporated in a new law. Additionally, the new
Law on investments in entrepreneurial activity has been adopted, that envisages offering
national treatment to foreign investors, the latter having equal rights with the local investors.
With regard to deregulating entrepreneurial activity, it should be mentioned that in
accordance with the Law on modification and completion of some legislative acts (no. 432XV, as of December 24, 2004) the Parliament of the Republic of Moldova approved the
amendments to the “Law on regulation of repatriation of funds, goods and services obtained
from external economic transactions”. One of the goals according to these is to ensure a more
simplified repatriation procedure for both legal entities and commercial banks. Commercial
banks, the National Bank of Moldova and the Centre for Preventing of Economic Crimes and
Corruption were exempted from the control on repatriation. The control function on
repatriation will be transmitted from these institutions to the State Fiscal Authority, which
will carry out verifications on repatriation within on-site inspections of the legal entities’
economic activity, conducted in accordance with the legislation in force. At the same time,
the mentioned Law stipulates extension of general repatriation periods of funds, goods and
services up to one year and the reduction of the fine the legal entities have to pay in case of
delay of repatriation. The exemption of commercial banks from the control on repatriation
will increase the effectiveness of the banking system, as commercial banks are eased from
additional burden and accordingly from extra costs.
The authorities also plan to revamp the privatization process. Actual progress in these
directions in the near future will demonstrate the degree of ownership of the EGPRSP. It
should also be mentioned that the Republic of Moldova became member of the European
Charter for Small Enterprises. The first country report was submitted at the end of 2004, and
has been placed on the European Commission’s site.
Fiscal Policy
Revenue performance in Moldova has been on an upward trend for a number of
years. In 2004, the tax revenue-to-GDP ratio is estimated to have further increased by about
1.1 percentage points reaching 29 percent, which is one of the highest in the region. In order
to ease the tax burden and stimulate business activity, as part of a broader tax reform
strategy, the authorities have made the decision to gradually lower corporate and personal
income tax rates. With persistent efforts to strengthen the administration, they believe that
losses from tax cuts will be more than fully compensated through the expanded tax base as
lower rates are expected to reduce incentives for tax evasion. Moreover, once the new
parliament is elected, the government intends to propose abolition of certain tax concessions
that the legislative body did not approve last year.
Given widespread poverty in the country, the budget is geared towards the poor, and
the expenditure priorities in the coming years will be guided by the poverty-reduction and

-4social objectives of the EGPRSP in line with the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework. In
the absence of a social safety net, the increase in the minimum pensions is intended to
provide at least minimal social protection to the most vulnerable. The authorities agree with
staff, that profound social reforms will be needed to ensure sustainability of the country’s
social system. Similarly, the increase in wages of the public sector to attract and retain
qualified staff will be considered in the context of the planned civil service reform.
Good progress was made to normalize relations with creditors and mitigate
vulnerabilities stemming from the large external debt. Buyback operations with Gazprom and
Hewlett Packard have been finalized, agreements on debt rescheduling with several bilateral
creditors have been reached and arrears considerably reduced. The reduction in arrears was
strongly favored by discount obtained on the debt buyback. However, arrears to Paris club
creditors still remain and need to be addressed in the near future for bringing the overall debt
burden to a sustainable level. At the same time, Moldova continued to remain current on all
interest payments and its obligations to multilaterals. Consequently, the external debt and
debt service indicators have notably improved.
The authorities realize that strong revenue performance and sound expenditure
management will be essential to meet their social goals and to continue honoring other
domestic and external liabilities. With the established track record in tax administration and
additional efforts to curb the shadow economy, they feel confident that their fiscal objectives
will be met in 2005.
Monetary policy
Large inflows of remittances have posed challenges to monetary policy
implementation. With price stability as an overriding objective, the National Bank of
Moldova (NBM) has been trying to strike a balance between reserve money growth and
exchange rate appreciation. Interventions in the foreign exchange market have been
instrumental in smoothing exchange rate fluctuations, building up international reserves and
preserving competitiveness, which has contributed to export growth. The authorities share
staff’s view that monetary policy can only have short-term effect on competitiveness and that
in the longer-term perspective this objective should be pursued through structural and policy
measures aimed at strengthening productivity. However, they also believe that this could be a
lengthy process, and meanwhile letting the exchange rate appreciate more rapidly could
damage the fragile export sector and dampen growth. Mindful of mounting inflationary
pressures due to an expanding money supply, the NBM sterilized part of its foreign exchange
interventions through more active use of monetary policy tools including the outright sale of
its holdings of discount treasury bills. In addition, to further improve the efficiency of its
operations in the money market, the NBM has recently launched a new instrument - the
NBM certificates with maturities of 14, 28 and 56 days. These securities were welcomed by
the markets and are expected to play an important role in liquidity management.
In closing, I would like to note that the Moldovan authorities consent to publication
of the staff report, the Selected Issues paper, the statistical appendix and the Financial System
Stability Assessment.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
February 17, 2005

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Concludes 2004 Article IV Consultation with the Republic of Moldova
On February 7, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with the Republic of Moldova.1
Background
Economic activity benefited from a favorable external environment in 2003-04. GDP grew by
6.3 percent in 2003, advancing to 6.5 percent (y-o-y) in the first half of 2004. Large and rising
workers’ remittances underpinned consumption-led growth, helping consolidate Moldova’s
recovery from the 1998 regional crisis. While strong economic performance in neighboring
countries encouraged exports, the contribution of net trade to growth was negative.
Notwithstanding the recovery, Moldova is lagging considerably behind its neighbors, partly as a
result of the Transnistria conflict. Moreover, productive capacity has weakened with the steady
exodus of working-age Moldovans following the 1998 crisis.
Twelve-month Consumer Price Index inflation peaked at 17 percent in October 2003, reflecting
a transitory flare-up in food prices, but moderated to about 11 percent by October 2004. The
appreciating leu has helped attenuate the impact from higher oil prices, but domestic spending
pressures and a tighter labor market have kept non-food goods price inflation up, while rapid
money and credit growth have rekindled inflationary expectations.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2Despite a substantial real exchange rate appreciation, international competitiveness remains
favorable. Dollar wages are well below those in neighboring countries, and exports have been
growing briskly. Although the real effective exchange rate appreciated by 11½ percent (y-o-y)
during the first three quarters of 2004, it remained below the end 2000 level. The official current
account deficit widened markedly to 6.8 percent of GDP in 2003, but the actual deficit is likely to
be smaller on account of unrecorded workers’ remittances, underinvoicing of exports, and
overinvoicing of imports.
Following a general government surplus in 2003, the fiscal stance loosened considerably in
2004. While tax revenues remained buoyant, owing to more aggressive tax collection efforts
and higher-than-expected inflation, projected nontax revenues and grants fell short of
expectations, and primary expenditure exceeded original budget projections. The budget was
revised in October 2004, and now staff projects a general government deficit of 1.1 percent of
GDP for 2004, compared to a deficit of 0.4 percent of GDP in the original budget. With limited
fresh external financing and lower-than-expected privatization receipts, the government
increased recourse to bank financing and continued to run up arrears to some bilateral
creditors, but resumed interest payments to the Paris Club. Recent external debt restructuring
agreements—notably a buyback of Gazprom promissory notes—together with the leu
appreciation, resulted in a marked decline in the external debt/GDP ratio.
Monetary policy was also expansionary in 2004, on account of continued large inflows of
remittances. With inflation moderating in 2004, the National Bank of Moldova (NBM) stepped up
its foreign exchange purchases and, as a result, international reserves hit a record high of
US$392 million at end- September, finally reaching pre-1998 levels. Despite more intense
sterilization efforts, by end-October both reserve and broad money were growing at over
30 percent (y-o-y).
Progress in structural reforms remains slow, while high transaction costs continue to hold back
private sector-led growth. Some progress has been registered in fiscal reforms, and in revising
the legal framework affecting investment, microfinance, audit, accounting, and leasing.
Nevertheless, despite efforts to simplify licensing and business registration, there has been no
significant improvement in the business climate. Moreover, the privatization program has
stalled, while corruption remains widespread and governance weak. Government interference in
the private sector—including formal and informal restrictions on exports of certain agriculture
goods—casts doubt over the authorities’ commitment to market-oriented reforms.
The completion of the Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy (EGPRSP) is a step in
the right direction, but implementation has been slow and uneven.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors welcomed the recent recovery of the Moldovan economy, the moderation of inflation,
and the strengthened external position. At the same time, Directors expressed concern about
the fragile basis of the recovery, and agreed that the key challenge ahead is to create an
environment supportive of private sector development and foreign investment that will help
promote sustained growth, domestic job creation, and poverty reduction. Accordingly, Directors

-3urged the authorities to assign top priority to revitalizing structural reforms and reducing
government intervention in the economy, while ensuring that macroeconomic policies are
geared to stem inflationary pressures and underpin long-term growth. Directors also highlighted
the importance of efforts to resolve the conflict in Transnistria.
Directors observed that Moldova’s recent rapid economic growth has benefited from a favorable
external environment as well as from large and rising workers’ remittances. While the short-run
outlook remains positive, they pointed to the risks of excessive dependence on remittances, as
well as to impediments to sustained growth in the medium term. These include: emerging labor
shortages and increasing capacity constraints resulting from large-scale emigration; rising
inflationary pressures from strong inflows of remittances and rapid wage growth; a difficult
business environment; and vulnerability to external shocks.
Directors stressed that the acceleration of structural reforms will be crucial for sustaining the
economic recovery and improving external competitiveness. They noted that structural reforms
have stalled, and urged the authorities to speed up implementation of the structural policies
envisaged in their Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy, with a view to
encouraging investment, reversing the current emigration trend, and channeling remittances
into productive use. This will need to involve decisive efforts to reduce government intervention
in the economy, revamp the privatization process, phase out excessive regulation, and reform
the public sector, with a view to improving service delivery. While the recently approved
anti-corruption strategy is a step in the right direction, Directors stressed that strong
implementation of this strategy will now be essential to demonstrate ownership and underpin
the reform effort.
Directors recommended a tighter fiscal stance than that envisaged by the authorities.
This would support the central bank’s efforts to control inflation and make room for current
external debt service, thereby preventing a further accumulation of arrears. To ensure
sustainability, fiscal policy would benefit from a more forward-looking perspective and greater
emphasis on a medium-term expenditure framework that provides for adequate resources for
poverty-related purposes. Directors commended the authorities’ efforts to strengthen the
budgetary process and improve tax administration, and also emphasized the need for measures
to broaden the tax base, including through the removal of tax exemptions. The importance of
efforts to strengthen the long-term viability of the pension system was also highlighted.
Directors recommended that monetary policy place greater emphasis on the inflation objective.
Given the recent rapid credit growth and strong foreign currency inflows, it will be important for
the National Bank of Moldova to tighten its stance, including through greater sterilization efforts,
if needed, to counteract rising inflationary pressures. Ensuring the independence of the National
Bank of Moldova would help achieve the low-inflation objective. While the buildup of reserves
from low levels was desirable, a number of Directors suggested that a nominal exchange rate
appreciation would be appropriate if foreign exchange inflows continue to grow rapidly, and that
going forward, a more flexible exchange rate policy would serve Moldova well in absorbing
external shocks. However, some Directors expressed reservations about allowing the exchange
rate to appreciate at this time, based on concerns about competitiveness and uncertain flows of

-4remittances. To improve competitiveness, Directors called for further efforts to remove
remaining impediments to trade.
Directors were encouraged to note that Moldova’s financial sector indicators are largely
favorable, but urged the authorities to address remaining vulnerabilities in line with the FSAP’s
recommendations. In particular, they called for a reduction in the government’s role and
administrative interference in the sector, for more transparency in the ownership structure of
financial institutions and corporations, and for efforts to address remaining weaknesses in the
AML/CFT framework.
Directors commended the authorities for successfully restructuring some of Moldova’s external
debt and reducing the overall debt burden. They welcomed the resumption of interest payments
to Paris Club creditors, but stressed that the outstanding arrears still need to be resolved, and
looked forward to continued efforts to normalize relations with external creditors.
Directors noted that Moldova’s official statistics are generally adequate for surveillance.
They encouraged the authorities to address the remaining shortcomings—notably regarding
price and national accounts statistics—with support of Fund technical assistance.
Directors looked forward to maintaining a close policy dialogue on the reform priorities with the
Moldovan authorities in the period ahead. They emphasized that the effective implementation of
a credible and well articulated reform program in line with the EGPRSP, together with restrained
short-term policies, will be essential for building the track record necessary for securing possible
new financing from the Fund.
