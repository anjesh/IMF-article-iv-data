THE GAMBIA
Staff Report for the 2003 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2003 Consultation with The Gambia
(In consultation with External Relations, Finance, Fiscal Affairs, Legal, Monetary and
Financial Systems, Policy Development and Review, and Statistics Departments)
Approved by Menachem Katz and Matthew Fisher
February 20, 2004
•

Discussions for the 2003 Article IV consultations were held in Banjul during June 23-July 11 and October
2-16, 2003, and in Washington DC on October 28 and December 9-10, 2003. The missions met with the
Vice President, the Secretary General, the Secretary of State for Finance and Economic Affairs, the
Governor of the Central Bank, other Secretaries of State (Trade, Tourism) and senior officials of The
Gambia. The missions also met with the majority and minority leaders in the National Assembly,
representatives of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), donors, and members of the business, finance,
agriculture, fishing and labor sectors.

•

Mission members were Messrs. Shields (head), Jacoby, Harjes, Bougha-Hagbe, Ms. Silman (administrative
assistant) (all AFR), Ms. Alexandraki (PDR), and Mr. Dalton (MFD). The missions worked closely with
parallel World Bank missions and other international agencies and donors.

•

The program supported by the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) approved by the Executive
Board on July 10, 2002 in an amount equivalent to SDR 20.22 million (65 percent of quota) is now far offtrack. Missions in October 2002 and February 2003 were unable to conclude the first PRGF review because
of a failure to meet several quantitative performance criteria and benchmarks, critical policy slippages, and
serious concerns about data reporting and other governance issues.

•

This report covers Article IV issues, including concerns about data reporting which severely aggravated the
assessment of the economy and the formulation of policy advice (see Executive Summary). The Managing
Director is reporting separately to the Executive Board on noncomplying disbursements to The Gambia
under the 1998-2001 PRGF arrangement (www.imf.org).

•

The political situation in The Gambia is stable. President Jammeh was reelected for another 5-year term in
October 2001, and his party secured all but three seats in parliamentary elections in January 2002. Both
elections were considered broadly fair by international observers.

•

Economic pressures and governance issues have recently led to a number of changes in the cabinet and the
dismissal of most of the central bank’s senior management, including the Governor. Charges of fraud in
connection with foreign exchange transactions in Swiss francs have been levied against the former
Governor and other former and current officials of the central bank.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Gambia’s PRGF-supported program is far off track. During 2002–03, excessive
fiscal deficits, central bank losses, and poorly conducted monetary policy led to rising
inflation, spiraling debt-service costs, and a depreciation of the exchange rate in terms of the
euro of over 60 percent. Accentuating the impact of the policy lapses, agricultural output
fell by one-third in 2002, following an unfavorable rainy season.
An insufficient commitment to contain public spending, compounded by weak
governance, lay at the heart of the policy shortcomings. Substantial quasi-fiscal spending,
including losses on questionable foreign exchange transactions by the central bank, together
with fiscal deficits (excluding grants) of 8.1 percent of GDP in 2002 and 6.0 percent in 2003,
led to a growth in reserve money of 34 percent during 2002 and 63 percent during 2003.
The authorities have acknowledged that data have been systematically misreported to
the Fund. Two PRGF disbursements in 2001 may have been noncomplying. Public
spending, estimated at equivalent to 7 percent of GDP, and which was financed directly out
of the foreign exchange reserves, was not recorded in the accounts of the central government
or international reserves in 2001. In addition, foreign currency, which was until recently
frequently purchased at extremely high premiums, was sometimes not delivered to the central
bank.
The recently concluded Fund safeguards assessment, which found severe weaknesses at
the central bank in all risk categories, recommended a special audit of foreign exchange
transactions to determine more precisely the magnitude and time path of hitherto
unrecorded transactions. It also outlined a series of improvements that are urgently
required in the internal organization, procedures and control mechanisms of the central bank.
The reestablishment of macroeconomic stability will require resolute actions to improve
governance, reduce the sizable prospective fiscal deficit for 2004 and restore external
budgetary support. Recent actions to tighten fiscal and monetary policies have included
overall cash ceilings on allocations for discretionary public spending and an increase in
treasury bill yields to 31 percent, considerably above current recorded CPI inflation of about
18 percent. At the same time, spending on poverty-related activities has been below the
objectives of the PRSP, and one-third of current expenditure is devoted to debt interest
payments.
The Gambian economy remains highly vulnerable to external shocks. Although capacity
and arrivals in the tourist sector are rising sharply and the reexport trade remains buoyant,
little progress has been made in increasing value added in tourism or in diversifying other
parts of the economy beyond groundnuts and other agricultural production. As a result, even
if macroeconomic stability and budgetary support from donors were quickly restored,
only modest GDP growth is in prospect in the medium term. To achieve more substantial
improvements in living standards and reductions in poverty, and take advantage of the recent
gains in external price competitiveness and the possible exploitation of offshore hydrocarbon

-5-

deposits, quick and effective action will be required to strengthen governance, upgrade the
currently inadequate infrastructure, implement well-targeted and coherent agricultural
policies, and encourage innovative approaches to private finance.
Although substantial technical assistance has been provided by the international
community in recent years, including under the Technical Cooperation Action Plan
(TCAP), implementation has been weak, in particular at the central bank and in
statistics. Planned reforms in public expenditure management and improvements in
accountability have been impeded by the slow pace of work on updating, closing, and
auditing government accounts.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
The Executive Board concluded the 2002 Article IV consultation with The Gambia
on July 10, 2002. Directors noted that economic performance in 2001 continued to be mixed,
with positive developments on real GDP growth and inflation counterbalanced by fiscal
slippages and a widening of the external current account deficit. They urged the authorities to
adhere to plans to achieve cumulative reductions in the overall fiscal deficit up to 2005 and to
develop a medium-term expenditure framework. Steps to contain public expenditure—
particularly from below-the-line accounts—and enhanced transparency and accountability
should be supported by improvements and reforms in tax administration. Welcoming the full
poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP), Directors stressed the importance of refining
sectoral priorities, strengthening governance, and improving macroeconomic and social data.
2.
Substantial errors have since been notified to staff in data reported to the Fund for this
period (Box 1). The Managing Director has issued a report to the Executive Board on
misreporting and associated noncomplying Fund disbursements under the 1998–2001 PRGF
arrangement.1
3.
In 1993, The Gambia accepted the obligations under Article VIII, Section 2(a), 3, and
4 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement. The Gambia maintains an exchange system that is
free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current transactions. Summaries of The
Gambia’s relations with the Fund, World Bank Group, and African Development Bank are
contained in Appendices I, II, and III, respectively. Outstanding statistical issues are
discussed in Appendix IV.
II. DATA REVISIONS
4.
The data revisions notified to staff in October 2003 imply a sharply different
performance of the Gambian economy during the latter part of the 1998–2001 PRGF
arrangement than was previously reported to the Executive Board (Box 1). Few
objectives of the program now appear to have been achieved. Inclusion of previously
unrecorded payments of US$28.5 million in 2001 would raise the level of public expenditure
from 24 percent to 31 percent of GDP and the fiscal deficit (excluding grants) from 8 percent
to 15 percent of GDP (Table 1A and Figure 1).2 Corrections to the previously reported level
of gross official foreign exchange reserves for unrecorded public spending, commission
payments and undelivered foreign exchange would reduce estimates of import cover at end
2003 to around 4½ months of imports, compared with the 7 months of imports implied by
previously provided data.

The authorities have more recently indicated that unrecorded payments were made in 2002 as well
as in 2001. They did not specify whether these were part of the US$28.5 million associated with 2001
or were additional to them.

-7-

5.
The remainder of this report incorporates the main implications of these data
revisions. However, as the staff is not yet in a position to confirm the precise magnitude or
time path of the previously unreported transactions (see Section V below), the related
assessments must be regarded as provisional.
Box 1. Revisions by the Central Bank of The Gambia to Data for the
Foreign Exchange Reserves and Lending to the Central Government

Officials of the Central Bank of The Gambia (CBG) notified staff on October 28, 2003 of substantial revisions to
data on foreign exchange reserves and lending to the central government submitted to the Fund during 2001-03,
reflecting three major errors:
•

No account had been taken in 2001 of payments made by the CBG of US$28.5 million in foreign
currencies on behalf of the government. This had led to an overstatement of gross foreign exchange
reserves since the end of 2001 by 45 percent of the revised end-2001 level and an understatement of public
spending and fiscal deficits equivalent to 6.8 percent of GDP.

•

The international reserves had erroneously been credited, during 2001 and subsequently, with currency
purchased from foreign exchange bureaus that had not been delivered. As a result, the reserves had been
further overstated by up to US$16 million.

•

The CBG had paid an additional, unrecorded US$1.84 million from the foreign exchange reserves in 2003
to finance commissions on recent foreign currency transactions. These transactions included a loan for
US$28 million from a commercial bank in the United States from March-May 2003 to secure a U.S. dollar
deposit in order to mask the shortfall in the reserves.

III. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND PERFORMANCE UNDER THE PRGF-SUPPORTED
PROGRAM
6.
The Gambia achieved an encouraging average GDP growth rate of 6 percent
and an average inflation rate of below 3 percent under the 1998–2001 PRGF
arrangement, largely reflecting a succession of good harvests (Figure 1). This favorable
performance was expected to be maintained under the macroeconomic framework of the
poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP), supported by the PRGF arrangement approved in
July 2002. 3
7.
Performance in 2002–03 fell a long way short of the PRSP assumptions. GDP
contracted in 2002, following a failure of the groundnut and other harvests, and recovered
only to 6 percent above the 2001 level in 2003. Consumer price inflation surged, reaching
21 percent on a 12-month basis in August 2003. The exchange rate depreciated in terms of
the euro by 60 percent in the two years to end-December 2003 (Figure 2).
8.
The declining internal and external value of the currency resulted largely from
the poor execution of monetary and fiscal policy, reflecting serious deficiencies in
governance. Economic imbalances, which reemerged in the latter part of 2001, coinciding
with presidential and national elections and substantial unrecorded public expenditure
payments, worsened in 2002–03. Critical quantitative performance targets and
benchmarks under the PRGF-supported program were missed (Table 10). Large fiscal
deficits, supplemented by quasi-fiscal spending including substantial losses on questionable
foreign exchange transactions by the CBG, led to average rates of growth in reserve money
of nearly 50 percent (Figure 1). Action to tighten monetary policy was late and inadequate.
Downward pressure on the exchange rate was accentuated by the impact on external
budgetary support and investor confidence of concerns about policy implementation and
governance.
9.
The vulnerability of the economy to external shocks remained largely
unaddressed. Tourism, the reexport trade, and groundnuts continued to provide the main
domestically generated sources of foreign exchange, and only in the hotels and restaurants
sector were there indications of a positive response to the improvement in external
competitiveness (Figure 4). Most of the population remained dependent on groundnut
farming and, hence, highly susceptible to weather variations.
10.
In October 2003, President Jammeh launched Operation No Compromise to address
concerns that unfair business practices and corruption were disrupting the economy and
leading to an unwarranted depreciation of the exchange rate. The informal foreign exchange
market was restricted; businesses and individuals were pressured to deposit or surrender all

rating (from Fitch Ltd).

-9-

foreign currency holdings; and some retailers were forced to reduce their selling prices for
essential goods. Subsequently, charges of tax evasion and fraud were reportedly laid against
several prominent businessmen and alleged collaborators in the public sector, and five
officials and former officials of the central bank were indicted on offenses related to Swiss
franc transactions by the CBG.
A. Macroeconomic Performance in 2002
11.
Real GDP shrank by about 3 percent in 2002. An unusually short rainy season led
to a halving of the groundnut harvest and a drop of nearly one-third in the output of other
crops. Strong growth was confined to the construction, utilities, and the hotel and restaurants
sectors (Table 2A).Within the small manufacturing sector, groundnut processing benefited
from additional capacity and the availability of a good crop in 2001.
12.
Reflecting the continuing high rates of monetary growth, the nominal effective
exchange rate index declined by 34 percent during the year, and consumer price inflation
rose to 13 percent on a 12-month basis.4 Although exports of processed groundnuts were at
near record levels, project-related imports rose and the balance on factor services deteriorated
as official interest receipts and private remittances declined; the current account deficit
(excluding grants) is estimated to have been equivalent to about 13 percent of GDP in 2002
(Table 7A and Figure 3).
13.
The overall fiscal deficit (excluding grants) reached 8.1 percent of GDP in 2002,
compared with a target of 5.0 percent5 (Figures 5 and 6). Most of the overshooting
reflected stronger-than-expected foreign-financed capital spending and higher debt interest
payments resulting from the exchange rate depreciation and the rise in treasury bill yields
(Figure 7); the basic primary fiscal surplus for 2002 fell only slightly short of its target level,
at 2.7 percent of GDP (Tables 3A and 4A).
14.
Reserve money grew by 34 percent during 2002, a substantial proportion of
which appears to have resulted from liquidity injections by the CBG associated with
losses on foreign exchange transactions. (Table 5A). These losses arose in part from
currency transactions with local foreign exchange bureaus involving exceptionally wide
spreads (at times well in excess of 10 percent). The rapid depreciation in the dalasi exchange

4

Actual inflation was probably much higher than official consumer price index (CPI) figures, which
are based on an outdated (1976) spending basket for the low-income urban population in the Banjul
area and give a relatively small weight to exchange rate sensitive items, such as fuel.

As indicated in footnote 2, no revisions have been incorporated in fiscal data for 2002 although the
authorities have indicated that some spending in that year may not have been recorded.

- 10 -

rate also led to losses from seasonal smoothing operations and the provision of foreign
currency to oil importers at a rate based on lagged-average dealing rates.6
15.
The lax monetary conditions gave rise to a 72 percent increase in credit to the
private sector during 2002, fuelling an increase in broad money of 35 percent and
providing an opportunity for speculation in real estate and foreign assets. In response,
the yield on treasury bills was raised in steps from 15 percent in July to 20 percent in
December (Figure 1). The government also instituted corrective fiscal measures in October
2002 . Budget execution was shifted to a cash basis, and a new National Emergency Fiscal
Committee (NEFCOM) was created to monitor and approve expenditure allocations. Fuel
prices were doubled to eliminate government subsidies (see Box 2), increases were
announced in selected excise taxes, and administrative fees were raised.
Box 2. Petroleum-Pricing Mechanism
The supply and pricing of petroleum products in The Gambia is determined by the authorities.
Importation is confined to a single contractor, chosen by a competitive government tender based on the
narrowest margin over the Platts reference price. Domestic pump prices are fixed intermittently taking
account of the landed cost of petroleum in dalasi, with allowances added for financing costs, duties,
excises, and trading and transportation margins. The financial consequences of sustained misalignments,
such as during the 2001–02 election cycle, are borne by the government. Since October 2002, the
authorities have sought to prevent costs falling on government by ensuring that dealers’ margins fully
reflect costs and adjusting pump prices quarterly.

B. Macroeconomic Performance in 2003
16.
Real GDP is estimated to have grown by 8.8 percent in 2003, on the basis of a
provisional report by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of a full recovery
in agricultural output following abnormally heavy and sustained rains.7 Production and
exports of groundnut products nevertheless dropped precipitously as a result of the failed
crop in 2002, and the external current account deficit is estimated to have widened slightly
despite higher tourism earnings and reduced imports for domestic use as a result of the real
depreciation of the exchange rate. The dalasi declined by a further 34 percent in nominal
effective terms in the 12 months to October 2003, and the official CPI rose by 18 percent
during 2003.
17.
The fiscal deficit (excluding grants) declined to 6.0 percent of GDP in 2003,
compared with a budget target of 4.5 percent. Domestic revenue is estimated to have

GDP.

- 11 -

undershot the budget by 2.7 percent of GDP, almost entirely due to weak customs
performance, but this was offset in part by the impact on noninterest current expenditure of
the tight cash ceilings imposed by NEFCOM.
18.
Monetary growth escalated further in 2003. With questionable central bank foreign
exchange transactions continuing in the first quarter, and the entire financing of the fiscal
deficit (including grants) being provided by the central bank (Figure 8 and Table 6A), reserve
money grew by 63 percent during the year. Holdings of treasury and central bank bills by the
private sector declined. Broad money grew by 43 percent, reflecting credit expansion of
48 percent to the private sector (which included finance for several major investment
projects, as well as rising household overdrafts).
19.
The authorities progressively increased interest rates, and treasury bill yields
reached 31 percent by September 2003. As part of the monetary tightening, starting in
April 2003, minimum reserve requirements were extended to include foreign currency
deposits and were increased in two steps from 14 percent to 18 percent. However, the
effectiveness of these measures was diluted because penalty mechanisms for shortfalls in
required reserves were not properly implemented until July 2003.
C. Structural Issues
20.
Weaknesses persisted in all areas of fiscal management. Although the Central
Revenue Department successfully took over the administration of the sales tax from the
Customs and Excise Department, collections performance in respect of customs duties
deteriorated further as a result of ineffective management and excessive use of discretionary
exemptions. The planning, execution and monitoring of public expenditure continued to be
impeded by the failure to close the fiscal accounts beyond 1999 and the lack of progress in
finalizing the general ledger, for which entries were not made beyond November 2001.
However, the elimination of the majority of below-the-line accounts and imposition of cash
budgeting under NEFCOM helped to restrain unbudgeted spending. Despite considerable
technical assistance, public expenditure management systems remain well below the standard
required for reliable reporting on HIPC and other poverty and program monitoring. The
finances of public enterprises are also not subject to effective monitoring or control. A draft
organic budget law, which should help to clarify procedures and responsibilities for public
sector fiscal management, was presented to cabinet but has not yet been approved for
submission to the National Assembly.
21.
Implementation of other structural reforms has been slower than planned,
although three out of five structural benchmarks under the first annual program under
the PRGF arrangement were completed before time, and a new household survey was
launched (Tables 11 and 12). To facilitate export growth, the Trade Gateway Project was
launched with World Bank support and The Gambia Investment and Free Zones Authority
was established. However, poor progress was made under the Technical Cooperation Action
Plan, particularly on central bank governance and statistics (Table 13), and little was
achieved on privatization.

- 12 -

D. Other Sectoral Issues
22.
The banking system in aggregate appears to be reasonably healthy, with the
overall capital adequacy ratio declining only marginally from 10.9 percent a year earlier to
10.6 percent at end-2002, well above the regulatory requirement for individual banks of
8 percent. Other indicators of financial sector stability, such as nonperforming loans and
provisioning, also remained stable. However, there was a sizable increase in household
overdrafts, which are not classified as non-performing if in default (Table 9). The regulatory
environment of the financial sector has been strengthened through passage of the Financial
Institutions, Insurance, and Money Laundering Acts.
23.
The Gambia has retained its generally open external environment. Imports are
subject to a maximum tariff of 18 percent. Export taxes are restricted to fish and fishing
products (10 percent), and gold and diamonds (3 percent).8 Although The Gambia has been
part of the exchange rate mechanism of the West African Monetary Zone (WAMZ) since
April 2002, the exchange rate regime has been flexible in practice, with intervention
generally limited to seasonal smoothing operations.9
24.
The real effective exchange rate declined by 46 percent between December 2001
and October 2003 (Figure 2). The improvement in underlying external competitiveness may
be considerably less than implied by this figure (because of measurement problems relating
to the CPI and delayed pass-through of price increases), but The Gambia’s relative cost
structure would now appear to provide considerable incentives for expansion of exports of
goods and services. However, apart from tourism-related activities, there are few signs yet of
an increase in export-related activity.
E. Poverty Reduction Strategy and HIPC Initiative
25.
In 2001, The Gambia ranked 149th on the human development index. Although
few quantitative indicators are available to assess progress toward the Millennium
Development Goals, it is likely that poverty has increased markedly since 2001, owing to the
crop failures of 2002, rising inflation, and limited provision of income support and social
services. Some of the priority social policy areas addressed in the PRSP have, however,
shown improvement in recent years, including gross school enrollment rates at lower basic
and secondary levels, particularly for girls, and immunization rates and the coverage of basic
health facilities (Table 14). The substantial donor support which was offered at the Geneva
roundtable in September 2002 has not as yet resulted in additional financing for the PRSP,
partly because of unresolved issues over macroeconomic performance and governance. The
first progress report on the PRSP is scheduled for completion in early 2004.
8

Further details of the trade regime and the outlook for exports are in Selected Issues (forthcoming).

9

The exchange rate regime is formally classified as a “managed float.”

- 13 -

26.
The Gambia reached the decision point under the enhanced Initiative for
Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) in December 2000 (www.imf.org), at which
time creditors committed themselves, in aggregate, to debt relief of US$66.6 million in net
present value (NPV) terms at the completion point. Interim assistance has been provided by
the IMF, World Bank, African Development Bank, European Investment Bank, and the
OPEC Fund, and, as of January 9 2003, by the Paris Club in the form of a flow rescheduling
on Cologne terms.10 However, since the PRGF-supported program went off track, the Paris
Club has informed the authorities that the second tranche of the rescheduling, covering the
period July 2003-July 2004, will not be enacted. Interim assistance by the Fund ceased on
January 1, 2004. The HIPC Initiative completion point cannot now be reached until
2005, at the earliest (Table 15).
IV. ECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND POVERTY REDUCTION
27.
The immediate economic outlook is poor. Despite a stabilization of the exchange
rate in the last quarter of 2003, inflationary pressures remain very strong in the wake of
persistently high rates of monetary growth. The fiscal deficit is projected to increase in 2004
and its financing—which relied entirely on the central bank in 2003—will be made more
difficult by the current withholding of donor support because of concerns about policy
implementation and governance. The debt outlook will worsen significantly and essential
improvements in infrastructure and other structural measures will be further delayed.
28.
Decisive action to correct the growing macroeconomic imbalances and
governance concerns could, however, mitigate some of the longer-term effects of the
poor performance. With The Gambia’s generally liberal economic environment, the recent
substantial improvement in external competitiveness, and the possible exploitation of
offshore hydrocarbon deposits, offer considerable potential for achieving the overdue
diversification of the economy beyond its four basic industries (production and processing of
groundnuts, reexport trade, and low-value-added tourism).
29.
The economy is therefore at a critical juncture. Accordingly, two contrasting
outlooks are explored below:
•

Scenario A (Tables 1A to 8A) is based on a continuation of the current policy stance.
No additional fiscal measures are assumed in 2004 beyond the budget proposals, but
monetary policy is tightened further to limit the extent of accumulation of inflationary
pressures. Some additional fiscal action is assumed in later years.

•

Scenario B (Tables 1B to 8B) assumes a more comprehensive policy response.
Additional fiscal measures are incorporated in 2004 (2.1 percent of GDP), monetary
policy is tightened substantially early in the year, and improvements are effected in

10

The rescheduling covers the period from July 17, 2002 through July 17, 2005.

- 14 -

governance and data provision. These actions are assumed to lead to a resumption of
donor budgetary support and the HIPC Initiative completion point is reached during
2005.
30.
Under scenario A, with no resumption of disbursements under the July 2002 PRGF
arrangement or of external budgetary support, domestic financing is projected to surge to
9.6 percent of GDP in 2004 and remain high in later years. (Tables 3A and 4A). As a result,
high inflation and the depreciation of the dalasi would persist. Foreign exchange reserves
would gradually be depleted by capital outflows and high external debt service associated
with not reaching the HIPC Initiative completion point. Debt sustainability would be
threatened, and external arrears might start to accumulate in later years. This adverse
macroeconomic scenario would further delay realization of delayed structural reforms,
inhibit financial sector innovation, and discourage domestic savings. Although GDP growth
rates might succeed in reaching to about 4 percent, the persisting uncertainty vis-à-vis the
macroeconomic environment would exact a long-lasting toll on productive capacity.

31.
Under scenario B, the beneficial impact of resumed external budgetary support and
fiscal measures on domestic financing, interest rates and exchange rate depreciation would
lead to lower debt-servicing costs in 2004 and the fiscal deficit (excluding grants) would
decline below 3 percent of GDP. Domestic financing requirements would be limited to
2 percent of GDP in 2004 (Tables 3B and 4B). Monetary growth would decelerate, which
would help contain the nominal depreciation of the exchange rate. Even with no further fiscal
measures, 12-month consumer price inflation could than be brought to below 5 percent by
end-2005, allowing a restoration of stable macroeconomic conditions in subsequent years.
However, under the enhanced HIPC Initiative, the NPV of public sector external debt would
fall only to about 200 percent of exports by end-2008 from 300 percent at end-2003.
32.
Even under scenario B, however, the bulk of the population would remain
dependent in the medium-term on agriculture, particularly groundnuts. This
dependence would limit the speed at which living standards could be expected to improve
and probably imply a continuation of real GDP growth at around 4-5 percent. To achieve
sustained GDP growth at rates of 6 percent, as envisaged in the PRSP for 2002-05 and,
hence, to have a better prospect of progressing toward the Millennium Development Goals,
would require an absence of adverse shocks, together with sharply favorable trends in donor
and expatriate inflows and foreign direct investment, accompanied by an expansion in
regional trade.
V. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Governance and Data Revisions
33.
Discussions on the performance of the economy and options for macroeconomic
policy were severely constrained by concerns about the integrity of key macroeconomic
data and a series of unresolved governance issues. Despite several requests from mid-2003
onward for information about apparent data inconsistencies, the staff and management were
informed only at end-October 2003 that data on fiscal transactions and foreign exchange
reserves had been substantially misstated for the period 2001–03. The audited financial
statements of the central bank for 2001 and 2002 also became available only at this time, and
the IMF safeguards assessment mission in November 2003 (Box 3) expressed serious
concerns about their quality.
34.
In response to the staff’s requests for elaboration and explanation of the data revisions
and measures taken to prevent a recurrence of these problems, the authorities explained that:
•

The newly recorded government spending of US$28.5 million from the foreign
exchange reserves in 2001 was related to additional spending on infrastructure, social
priorities, agriculture, and national security, made in anticipation of unspecified donor
support that did not subsequently materialize. The payments made in 2001 had been
retrospectively classified as a foreign currency loan by the central bank to the central
government, repayable in domestic currency over 15 years from June 2004 at an
interest rate of 4 percent.

- 16 -

•

The nondelivery of foreign currency that had been purchased from foreign exchange
bureaus reflected “undesirable” arrangements. The outstanding amounts, which had
declined to about US$11 million by end-June 2003, had been retrospectively
classified as loans to the private sector. No interest charges had been applied, but full
repayment would be required by end-October 2003.

•

Spending of at least US$0.8 million had been incurred in arranging a short-term
US$28 million loan from a foreign bank in February 2003. No details were provided
of the classification of this payment.

•

Oversight of foreign exchange transactions at the CBG would henceforth be the
responsibility of a committee chaired by the General Manager. Changes had been
made in the senior management of the CBG, including the Governor and the heads of
the Foreign, Financial Control and Research Departments.

35.
The staff also sought more information, unsuccessfully, about foreign exchange
swaps apparently executed by the CBG since June 2002 and about instructions by the
government to the CBG to lend US$5 million to a newly created public enterprise in
March 2003 for a three-dimensional seismic survey of offshore oil deposits, which had not
been anticipated in the PRGF-supported program.
36.
The staff noted that, in addition to the serious governance issues implied by the
unprogrammed and unrecorded payments, and the inadequate supporting information, the
loans to the central government and foreign exchange bureaus appeared to contravene aspects
of the Central Bank of The Gambia Act, which places requirements on the time period, size,
and interest rates charged for such loans.
37.
Management and staff have advised the authorities that a special audit of foreign
exchange activity at the central bank since December 2000, conducted under an agreed
terms of reference, would be a critical step toward establishing comprehensive
information on the unprogrammed government expenditure and necessary revisions to
the fiscal accounts and foreign reserve positions. It would provide essential material on the
basis of which a resumption of discussions towards a possible Fund-supported program
might be initiated.

- 17 -

Box 3. Safeguards Assessment
The safeguards assessment concluded that there were severe vulnerabilities at the CBG in all five areas
assessed (the external audit mechanism, the independence of the bank and the legal structure, the
financial reporting framework, the internal audit mechanism, and the internal control system). The
principal recommendations proposed by the staff included the following:
•

A new external auditor with proven experience and expertise in central banking operations
should replace the current auditor.

•

A special audit should be conducted by the new audit firm to ascertain the nature and
magnitude of possible misreporting to the Fund.

•

The new audit firm should reaudit the 2001 and 2002 financial statements.

•

The CBG should agree to retain future disbursements under the current or a new PRGFsupported arrangement in the SDR holdings account and to commission quarterly audits of
essential quantitative performance criteria under such a program, until adequate controls are in
place.

•

International accounting standards (IAS) should be adopted as the permanent accounting
framework of the CBG.

•

A review of internal controls should be commissioned and an action plan developed to remedy
observed weaknesses.

The authorities agreed with the findings of the report and committed to implement some of the
recommendations with regard to adoption of international accounting standards and establishment of an
independent audit committee to oversee audit processes and internal controls. However, they made no
commitments on any of the critical recommendations, including the first three items listed above.

B. Macroeconomic Policies and Developments
38.
In light of staff’s concerns about the need for urgent and resolute action to restore
macroeconomic stability, discussions focused on possible fiscal policy measures, the
appropriate settings for monetary instruments, and central bank governance.
Fiscal policy
39.
The staff suggested urgent consideration of quick-acting revenue measures to
reduce a fiscal financing gap for 2004 that was projected at about 9 percentage points of
GDP in the absence of external budgetary support. 11 In seeking to minimize the adverse
distributional effects of any tax increases, staff suggested broadening the base of the sales tax
11

The projections included increases in public sector wage rates of 10 percent.

- 18 -

and raising the rate applied to imported goods in line with that of domestic services.
Measures might also be considered which impacted particularly on spending and profits in
the tourism and reexport sectors, bearing in mind the beneficial impact on these sectors of the
exchange rate depreciation. Amongst other possible measures, the staff also advocated
stronger enforcement procedures to collect revenue arrears and to redress serious
shortcomings in customs procedures and duty exemptions, together with accelerated
privatization, and continued tight control on discretionary expenditure through NEFCOM,
although the adverse consequences of cash budgeting for spending prioritization would need
to be addressed.
40.
The authorities expressed reservations about possible new measures aimed at the
tourism sector, or measures with a direct effect on the domestic price level. They argued
that exporters should retain both windfall rents and larger future margins as an incentive to
expand their activities, noting concerns that prices paid in foreign currencies to hotels had
been squeezed by foreign tour operators, and that measures with a direct negative impact on
living standards could cause an adverse social reaction. However, the authorities confirmed
that NEFCOM’s mandate would be continued through 2004 (with more flexible monthly
limits) and that measures to collect tax arrears and improve customs performance would be
reinforced.12 The latter step would be facilitated by the accelerated establishment, by mid2004, of the new Revenue Authority, which would benefit from the use of private sector
expertise and well-targeted incentives, and by the creation of a large taxpayer unit, using
technical assistance from the IMF and World Bank. In addition, the budget presented to the
national assembly on December 19, 2003 proposed that some government charges, licensing,
and other fees be increased and additional parcels of land sold (together yielding an
additional 0.7 percent of GDP in 2004).
Monetary policy
41.
The staff welcomed the further tightening in monetary policy since February
2003, which was viewed as overdue. However, noting the overshooting in the monetary
aggregates, the prospective fiscal deficit, the reluctance of the private sector to increase
holdings of government bills and the continued expansion in private credit, the current level
of interest rates was unlikely to be sufficient to achieve the required restraint in monetary
growth.
42.
The staff expressed concern regarding the deficiencies that had been exposed in
the operating procedures of the central bank, including the lack of separation of backoffice from dealing functions, the absence of clear policies guiding investment operations in
foreign exchange, and the ineffectiveness of internal control procedures; these factors may
have contributed to the high costs incurred in foreign exchange transactions, the resultant
12

A recent high-profile case, involving Youth Enterprise Development, has attracted considerable
media attention.

- 19 -

surge in monetary growth, and the nonrecording of payments from foreign exchange reserves
on behalf of the government. Attention would need to be focused urgently on the operation of
control mechanisms in the central bank, the overdue review of the Central Bank of The
Gambia Act, and ways of ensuring that the central bank acts in practice with due
independence from the central government, but with full accountability.
43.
The staff provided calculations indicating that the high cost of foreign exchange
transactions by the CBG may have been responsible for over half of the 34 percent
increase in reserve money in the 12 months to December 2002. 13 While accepting the
thrust of the staff’s calculations, the then Governor of the CBG disputed the magnitudes
involved and pointed out that the foreign exchange had been provided to oil importers on
explicit government instructions.
44.
The staff expressed concern about the implications for the conduct of monetary
policy of the dependence of liquidity management on the primary issuance of treasury
bills for monetary policy purposes. This exposes the central bank to pressure from the
central government in the determination of interest rates and opens the possibility of
unwarranted spending from the “sterilization account” into which proceeds from treasury bill
issues are placed. The authorities indicated that current arrangements are under review.
C. Structural Reforms
45.
The staff noted that The Gambia’s open trading environment and improvements
in external competitiveness and preferential market access14 offered considerable
opportunities for diversification of the economy, including into horticulture, fishing,
upscale tourism, and extraction of offshore oil and other mineral resources.15 This would
require that infrastructure deficiencies be addressed, particularly in the provision of
electricity and water, as well as in the availability of private finance. The rejuvenation of the
privatization program, encouragement of the relatively undeveloped microfinance sector, and
certain aspects of land reform could play key roles. Improvements in governance and the
working of the judicial system would also be crucial so that investors would have confidence
that property rights could be respected and enforced and disputes resolved.
46.
The staff noted the authorities’ concerns about the impact on The Gambia’s
reexport and transit trades of actions by Senegal regarding border closures, restrictive
13

The Gambia is eligible for preferential access under the European Union’s Everything But Arms
initiative and, since January 2003, under the U.S. African Growth and Opportunity Act.
15

A fuller discussion of measures to encourage diversification of the economy is in Selected Issues
(forthcoming).

- 20 -

transport regulations, and other apparent nontariff barriers. While the effect has in the
past been relatively small because of the informal—and thus highly flexible—basis on which
much of the trade has operated, recent reductions in Senegal’s external tariffs, which have
brought them close to those applying in The Gambia, have reduced the relative profitability
of informal imports through The Gambia. The potential development of the port of Banjul,
and associated freight-related businesses, might therefore be usefully facilitated by further
progress in recent bilateral discussions over customs-related and other issues.16
47.
Although the groundnut harvest seemed to have recovered well in late 2003, the
staff observed that there had been substantial shortages of good-quality groundnut
seeds and other inputs in the planting season. This appeared to have reflected insufficient
coordination within and between government departments, compounding the impact of
ineffective extension services. In the longer run, irrigation could play a vital role in
mitigating the vulnerability of groundnuts to weather variations. To encourage further
agricultural diversification, steps to promote the development of vegetable gardening,
horticulture, and sesame are under consideration, including by strengthening marketing and
transportation links with the tourism sector.
D. Data Issues
48.
The staff stressed the urgency of implementing the improvements in data
production and dissemination recommended by Fund technical assistance missions.
Data are often late and of inadequate quality, and methodological problems or outdated
weights limit the usefulness of time series on real activity and prices. Data have been
perceived in the past as generally adequate for Fund surveillance, but recent substantial
revisions, apparent internal inconsistencies, and delayed submissions raise serious questions
about data reliability and integrity and whether the provisions of IMF Article VIII Section 5
are being satisfied. These issues will be further addressed during future staff missions. The
staff is also concerned that macroeconomic data are now being published only once a year—
in the budget speech—and only in partial form.
VI. STAFF APPRAISAL
49.
Policy and governance shortcomings in the last two years have taken a heavy toll
on the economy and set back the country’s medium-term development strategy.
Performance has fallen well short of the targets envisaged in the PRSP’s macroeconomic
framework. Poverty has probably increased, GDP growth has been erratic, inflation has risen
strongly, and the exchange rate has depreciated very sharply. The completion point under the
enhanced HIPC Initiative cannot now be reached until 2005, at the earliest.

16

The recent agreement to process much of Mali’s transit trade through Banjul may increase port
activity by 25 percent.

- 21 -

50.
The fiscal slippages of 2001, which undermined progress made under the 1998–
2001 PRGF arrangement, continued throughout the period, amplified by quasi-fiscal
spending, including through central bank losses associated with the conduct of
questionable foreign exchange transactions. Measures to restrain the resultant excessive
growth in the money supply were late and inadequate.
51.
A detailed assessment of economic performance and policies has, however, been
hampered by the absence of a complete and verified set of data revisions following the
recent acknowledgement by the authorities of serious misstatements in data previously
provided for the period 2001–03. Also, the fiscal accounts have neither been closed since
1999 nor audited since 1991. Regular provision of data to the Fund, particularly by the CBG,
during the period of the PRGF-supported program was deficient in coverage, quality and
timeliness.
52.
The resumption of discussions on a possible Fund-supported program will
require that these concerns, which involve the integrity of key macroeconomic data, be
addressed. A special audit of the foreign exchange transactions of the CBG and reaudits
of the 2001 and 2002 financial statements would be major steps in this direction.
Considerable external technical assistance is potentially available to improve the quality and
production of essential statistics, including under the Technical Cooperation Action Plan,
assuming the authorities demonstrate their ability to use such assistance effectively.
Systematic publication of economic data should be resumed.
53.
Execution of monetary policy has been unsatisfactory throughout much of the
period. The conduct of certain foreign currency transactions by the CBG contributed to a
sharp acceleration in the growth of reserve money. There was also an unprecedented growth
in private sector credit. The delayed policy response—increasing interest rates and raising
minimum reserve requirements—was not sufficient to stabilize monetary conditions.
Further strong action will be required to rein back excessive monetary growth rates.
54.
Improvements are required in the CBG’s internal organization, procedures, and
controls to address the severe vulnerabilities identified in the Fund safeguards
assessment. Monitoring of monetary data should be enhanced and arrangements for
determining the issue of treasury bills should be subject to further consideration. The
review of the Central Bank of The Gambia Act to conform to modern central bank law is
overdue.
55.
More recently, implementation of fiscal policy has improved. Control of outlays
on discretionary items by NEFCOM has imposed more rigid spending discipline on
departments and has successfully restrained overall noninterest expenditure despite
unprogrammed wage increases. Tax revenue administration is also being tightened.
Nevertheless, the prospective fiscal deficit for 2004 is too large. To provide the basis for a
return to macroeconomic stability, additional fiscal measures will be required, together
with actions that will allow the resumption of external budgetary support.

- 22 -

56.
No sustained improvement in economic conditions will be possible without a
fundamental enhancement in governance. Action is urgently required to prevent further
unprogrammed public expenditure and unauthorized action by the CBG, tighten customs
procedures and tax exemptions, and scrutinize effectively the actions of public enterprises.
57.
Medium-term prospects, in particular for raising the living standards of the
poor, will continue to depend largely on the performance of agriculture, including
groundnuts. While weather-related shocks are inevitable, a coordinated policy approach to
ensure the security of high-quality seed supply and other agricultural inputs, and improved
marketing arrangements (as well as irrigation), could lessen substantially the adverse impact.
It will also be important for access to finance to be improved for smallholders, as well as,
more generally, for small and medium-sized enterprises. The recent sharp decline in the real
exchange rate has substantially increased export incentives, improving prospects for the longoverdue diversification of the economy.
58.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held in accordance with the
provisions of the decision on consultation cycles approved on July 15, 2002.

this would not be possible before late 2005. The NPV of debt for 2000-2004 shows only the effect of interim assistance.

1/ Valued at current exchange rates.
2/ Excluding advances to the government in foreign currencies.
3/ These advances reflect previously unrecorded public spending and borrowing in 2001, financed by the Central Bank of The Gambia (CBG),
and previously unrecorded depletion of foreign exchange reserves in 2001-03 as reported by the authorities on October 28, 2003.
4/ In March 2003, the government instructed the CBG to lend the equivalent of D 137 million in U.S. dollar to a newly created public enterprise
for a seismic survey of offshore oil deposits.
5/ Claims on foreign exchange bureaus reflect the delayed delivery of foreign currency purchased on a spot basis.

Sources: The Gambian authorities; and staff estimates and projections.
1/ Valued at current exchange rates.
2/ Excluding advances to the government in foreign currencies.
3/ These advances reflect previously unrecorded public spending and borrowing in 2001, financed by the Central Bank of The Gambia (CBG),
and previously unrecorded depletion of foreign exchange reserves in 2001-03 as reported by the authorities on October 28, 2003.
4/ In March 2003, the government instructed the CBG to lend the equivalent of D 137 million in U.S. dollar to a newly created public enterprise
for a seismic survey of offshore oil deposits.
5/ Claims on foreign exchange bureaus reflect the delayed delivery of foreign currency purchased on a spot basis.
6/ Reserve requirements are assumed to be lowered to 16 percent in 2005, and to 14 percent in 2006.

1/ Currently, the banking sector in The Gambia consists of six banks: the Standard Chartered Bank, Trust Bank,
International Bank for Commerce, Arab Gambia Islamic Bank, Guaranty Trust Bank and First International Bank.
In 2001, the data include the Continent Bank, a small bank that catered mainly to lower-income customers,
which was put into liquidation by the CBG in January 2002.
2/ The large increase in loans outstanding since December 2001 reflects both several major investment projects
(new ferries and a new ferry terminal, a large loan to Gamtel, oil sector loans) and a sizable increase in
household overdrafts.
3/ Overdrafts in default are not included in NPLs.

Poverty reduction

Preparation of a full PRSP through a participatory process and satisfactory
implementation for one year.

PRSP launched mid-2002. First full-year
progress report due in early 2004.

Improvement of the poverty database and monitoring capacity, as evidenced
by progress in restructuring the Central Statistics Department (CSD) or
developing its capacity.

Making progress. CSD has developed a
restructuring strategy and is receiving technical
assistance from the World Bank and IMF. The
household survey and census are being
conducted; the economic census will be launched
in 2004.

Macroeconomic stability

Continued maintenance of macroeconomic stability, as evidenced by
satisfactory implementation of the PRGF-supported program.

PRGF-supported program off track.

Governance

Progress in strengthening public expenditure management, as evidenced by
the issuance of annual public reports on the overall budget execution and
semiannual reports on the use of interim HIPC Initiative debt relief.

First two semiannual reports submitted in May
and November 2002; no subsequent updates.
National budget reports annual budget execution
with a two-year lag.

Social sector reforms

Budgetary savings from interim HIPC debt relief to be used in accordance
with the annual budgets approved by the Task Force and the HILEC.

was introduced, and since then the exchange rate has been determined by market forces.
Effective June 30, 2002, the exchange arrangement of The Gambia was reclassified to
managed float with no preannounced path for the exchange rate, from independently floating.
At end-December 2003, the midpoint exchange rate in the interbank market was D 30.96 per
U.S. dollar.
The Gambia has been part of the exchange rate mechanism of the West African Monetary
Zone since April 2002.
Last Article IV Consultation
The 2002 Article IV consultation (www.imf.org) was concluded by the Executive Board on
July 18, 2002. Since the conclusion of the first review under the PRGF arrangement was
delayed, the next Article IV consultation was due by July 2003, with the usual three months’
grace.

APPENDIX II

The Gambia: Relations with the World Bank Group
(As of November 17, 2003)
The World Bank, through IDA, has assisted the Gambian government in pursuing four main
objectives: (i) establishment of a macroeconomic and sectoral environment conducive to
economic growth; (ii) rehabilitation and development of infrastructure; (iii) development of
human capital through the provision of more efficient social services; and (iv) capacity
building in departments that have a key role for economic management. Instruments used in
supporting these objectives have been sector-based investment projects. Currently, there are
no adjustment credits, although there were two structural adjustment credits in the past,
Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL) I and SAL II. In February 2003, the Bank’s Board
approved the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for The Gambia for fiscal-years (FY)
2003–05, which is currently under implementation.
As of November 17, 2003, IDA had approved 30 credits worth a total amount of about
US$271 million, of which about US$60 million remain undisbursed. The current portfolio
consists of six projects in health, HIV/AIDS, education, poverty alleviation (infrastructure),
capacity building for economic management, and private sector development (trade
gateway), totaling US$99 million.
In health, the Participatory Health/Population/Nutrition operation was approved in March
1998. It aims at improving the quality of services related to reproductive health, infant and
child health, and nutrition for women of reproductive age, infants, and children. It also aims
at improving the quality of management and implementation of a family health program. An
HIV/AIDS Rapid Response operation was approved in January 2001. The project aims at (i)
containing the HIV/AIDS pandemic; (ii) reducing the spread of the pandemic and mitigating
its effects; and (iii) increasing access to prevention services, as well as treatment, care, and
support for those infected and affected by HIV/AIDS.
In education, the Third Education Sector Project was approved in September 1998 to support
the implementation of the second half of the government's Education Sector Policy
Framework, 1988–2005, and its accompanying investment program.
A Poverty Alleviation and Municipal Development operation was approved in March
1999, with the following objectives: (i) to reduce the backlog in public infrastructure
development and improve the maintenance of public assets; (ii) to alleviate poverty through
the creation of temporary jobs and improvements in the selection of small and medium-sized
investments, which should aim at upgrading the living environment of the poor; and (iii) to
strengthen the technical and managerial capacity of local authorities (with an emphasis on
their financial situation), local private firms (namely, consultants and contractors), and
Gamworks (a procurement agency).
A Capacity Building for Economic Management Project was approved in July 2001 to
help (i) build government capacity for economic planning, policy formulation, and execution,

- 60 -

APPENDIX II

and (ii) build the capacity of the judicial and financial systems to facilitate private sector
development.
A Trade Gateway Project was approved in February 2002 to help the country establish itself
as a globally competitive export and processing center by laying the foundations for
expanded private investment, export-oriented production, and employment through the
establishment of a free zone and an improved institutional environment.
The next education and health projects, as well as a community-based rural development
project, are being prepared, with expected Board approval in FY 2005.
As of April 30, 2002, the IFC’s portfolio had two investments with a balance of about
US$0.6 million. The current portfolio includes investments for a medical clinic (Ndebaan)
and commercial fishing (Lyefish).
IDA, MIGA, and the IFC will continue to coordinate their respective roles to support
development activities in The Gambia. These activities are being enhanced by the IFC’s
office in Dakar, which also oversees the IFC’s activities in The Gambia.

APPENDIX III

The Gambia: Relations with the African Development Bank
The African Development Bank (AfDB) Group began lending operations in The Gambia in
1974 and has since approved 46 projects (11 of which financed by grants) in the transport,
social, public utilities, agricultural, and industrial sectors. As of September 2003, 23 projects
had been completed while 18 projects were ongoing, amounting to total commitments of
UA 79.7 million (US$103.6 million.) The AfDB is also a major participant in The Gambia’s
enhanced Initiative for Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC Initiative) program, under
which it is due to grant debt relief of US$15.7 million in net present value (NPV) terms
(23.6 percent of the total debt relief under the program.)
The AfDB’s most recent strategy for The Gambia covers the period 2002–04 and aims at
assisting the country in its efforts to meet the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by
addressing specific institutional and human capacity constraints. The plan is based on The
Gambia’s poverty reduction strategy (SPA-II), and the base-case scenario focuses on the
following lending and nonlending (grant) interventions.

1/ 1 UA = US$1.3.

If the current policy and institutional framework for The Gambia improves—as
proxied by the country’s performance in implementing the IMF’s Poverty Reduction and
Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement, the fulfillment of some required conditions for
reaching the completion point of its HIPC Initiative program, and improvement in the
implementation of the AfDB Group portfolio—the country will move to a higher-case
scenario, and an additional UA 4.38 million will be allocated to the country for financing an
agricultural-related project. Conversely, the low-case scenario will apply if there is a
deterioration in the current policy and institutional framework, in which case The Gambia
will qualify for only UA 1.74 million of its basic allocation. Under this scenario, the already

- 63 -

APPENDIX III

appraised policy-based operation will not be granted. The Gambia’s AfDB strategy for 2005–
07 will be prepared in early 2005.
Implementation of the AfDB’s strategy is achieved through lending and nonlending
activities. The extent of the former is dependent on a satisfactory performance under the
IMF-supported PRGF, progress made toward reaching the HIPC Initiative completion point,
advances in strengthening public expenditure management, and improved performance of the
AfDB-sponsored projects themselves. Intervention through the nonlending program aims at
strengthening policy dialogue with the government and stakeholders and focuses mainly on
studies, funded through grants, to improve governance, mainstream gender, fight HIV/AIDS
and communicable diseases, and improve energy supply.

- 64 -

APPENDIX IV

The Gambia: Statistical Issues
There are substantial weaknesses in The Gambia's economic and financial statistics,
especially in the national accounts, balance of payments, and external debt statistics. The
poor quality of some of the data and complete lack of others have hampered recent analysis
of economic developments. Data reporting by the authorities to the Fund has become
increasingly irregular over the past year. The Gambia participates in the General Data
Dissemination System, and its metadata have been posted on the Fund’s Dissemination
Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB) since May 2000.
Real sector
The annual national accounts are compiled using the production approach only. They rely
heavily on indicators, in the absence of more comprehensive information. Accordingly,
following Statistics Department (STA) assistance on national accounts since 1998, a program
has been prepared by the Central Statistics Department (CSD) focusing on (i) strengthening
the quality of source statistics by improving and expanding existing surveys, (ii) improving
the coverage and methodology of the GDP estimates, including the implementation of the
1993 System of National Accounts (SNA), (iii) rebasing the constant price estimates—
currently based on1976/77—to a more recent period, and (iv) developing independent
estimates of the expenditure aggregates. STA assistance has been followed up by regular
visits by a peripatetic adviser, who is also assisting with prices. Currently, the CSD produces
consumer price index (CPI) data based only on the 1976/77 weights for the low-income
population of the greater Banjul area. As with the national accounts, improvements in the
CPI will require that the CSD—which is particularly weak—is provided with adequate
resources in terms of both quantity and quality.
Government finance
The authorities provide the staff with information on central government transactions with a
lag of about five-six weeks for revenue data, and with a lag of up to two months for
expenditure data based on “flash” reporting. Reporting in the treasury ledger is subject to
considerable delay, and central government accounts have neither been audited since 1991
nor closed since 1999. Particular weaknesses also persist in compiling data on an economic
basis, and in tracking foreign-financed expenditure, in particular resources provided in the
context of the enhanced Initiative for Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC Initiative) and
of the poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP) implementation. Data on domestic
government financing are available on a monthly basis with a lag of three-four weeks. The
three-year rolling public investment program has not been updated for some time, and the
execution of public investment needs closer monitoring. The authorities have also
acknowledged that substantial payments were made in 2001 and 2002 but not recorded in the
government accounts.

- 65 -

APPENDIX IV

Monetary data
Data reporting by the Central Bank of The Gambia (CBG) has become increasingly irregular
over the past six months. Monthly balance sheet data of the CBG should be available within
two weeks after the end of the reference month, and data for the monetary survey should be
provided with a lag of about three weeks. The coverage of commercial banks in the monetary
survey is comprehensive, although there has been no follow-up on the recommendations of
the STA mission on monetary statistics in August 2001 regarding the inclusion of
noncommercial bank depository corporations (the Postal Savings Bank and Village Savings
and Credit Associations (VISACAs)) in the monetary survey. The commercial banks follow
a uniform chart of accounts to report financial data to the CBG. Flash reports of key
monetary data are also sent from the banks to the CBG on a weekly basis. Over the past two
years, the CBG has introduced several reclassifications of the monetary accounts in an
attempt to improve sectorization and coverage, as well as to harmonize the data reported to
STA and AFR. Substantial revisions to data on foreign exchange transactions and lending to
the central government for the period 2001–03 have recently been transmitted.
Balance of payments
A large proportion of The Gambia's external transactions, including reexports, are in the
informal sector. Inclusion of these activities in the balance of payments statistics is handled
by using a crude estimation procedure, including the assumption that reexports are a fixed
share of total imports and tourism revenue is a simple function of tourist arrivals. Data on
trade, customs collection, and tourist arrivals are available with long lags. Data on private
capital flows are poor. Official grant and loan disbursements and repayments are relatively
well recorded (with some gaps in project disbursements). Data on the gross and net
international reserves of the central bank are available with short lags, but have recently been
substantially revised for 2001–03.
The Fund provided technical assistance (TA) on balance of payment statistics in June-July
1999 and September 2000. In reviewing progress, the 2000 mission noted that some
advances had been made in the compilation of balance of payments statistics and that several
of the 1999 mission’s recommendations had been implemented. Based largely on the
mission’s recommendations, the CBG established a balance of payments unit, equipped with
computer resources, and initiated surveys of the banking sector, insurance companies, travel
and shipping agents, hotels, and foreign embassies. With assistance from the UK Department
for International Development, the CBG conducted an enterprise survey to collect data for
the International Investment Position. However, several recommendations from TA mission
remain outstanding, and little further progress is being made. These recommendations
include, among other things, obtaining better estimates of the reexport trade by undertaking a
survey of the major importers/exporters, collecting data on foreign-owned construction
enterprises involved in major construction activity, and conducting periodic surveys of
Gambians traveling abroad.

- 66 -

APPENDIX IV

The government has fully computerized its database on the stock of external public debt and
the related debt-service obligations, using the Commonwealth Secretariat’s debt-reporting
and management system with technical assistance from The World Bank. Recently, there
have been some problems in operating the system due to staff changes in the debt unit of the
finance ministry and the data have become unreliable.
Publication
The only regular provision of macroeconomic data to the public is through references in the
annual budget speech. The central bank's annual report and quarterly bulletins, which are
intended to convey much of the nation’s macroeconomic data, have not been published since
2000 and the Central Statistics Department's (CSD) publications have also not been
appearing.
There has been no reporting of data for publication in the Government Finance Statistics
Yearbook since 1993 or in Balance of Payments Statistics and International Financial
Statistics (IFS), other than monetary and CPI data, since 1997.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
March 8, 2004
1.
This statement reports on: (i) the response of President Jammeh to a letter from the
Managing Director concerning internal controls and the auditing of foreign exchange activity
at the Central Bank of The Gambia; (ii) an announcement by President Jammeh about
potential oil reserves and exploitation; and (iii) data on the foreign exchange reserves,
groundnuts production and customs revenue that have been received since the issuance of the
staff report and the Managing Director’s Report on Noncomplying Disbursements. The
authorities have indicated that they would like both these reports to be published. The
information in this statement does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal or the Managing
Director’s recommendation on corrective action.
2.
A letter was received by the Managing Director on February 20, 2004 from the
President of The Republic of The Gambia (dated February 12, 2004) in response to the
Managing Director’s letter of December 9, 2004 (EBS/04/30, Supplement 1). In his letter,
President Jammeh indicated that a number of actions had been taken by The Gambian
authorities in respect of the outstanding foreign currency purchase contracts from foreign
exchange bureaus. President Jammeh also expressed his willingness to meet with IMF staff
in Banjul to discuss (i) a possible change in the auditor of the CBG; (ii) possible reaudits of
the 2001 and 2002 CBG financial statements; and (iii) a possible “separate and independent
examination of the CBG external reserves”. No indication of the prospective timing of the
proposed meeting with the President has yet been received by staff.
3.
President Jammeh announced on February 13, 2004 that the results of a threedimensional seismic survey of the oil potential of 500 square kilometers of maritime territory
had been “very positive”. He referred to the existence of large quantities of oil in
The Gambia, especially in the study area. The President said that it was intended to have a
test well drill before the end of this year.

Weekly data provided by the Central Bank of The Gambia indicate that
The Gambia’s gross international reserves stood at SDR49.0 million on
February 27, 2004 compared with SDR42.0 million on December 31, 2003.

•

The authorities’ current estimate for groundnut production in 2003 is 90,000 tons
compared with the provisional figure from the Food and Agriculture Organization
(FAO) of 127,000 tons used in the staff report. This would imply real GDP
growth in 2003 of about 7 percent, rather than 8.8 percent.

•

The authorities have reported that collection of revenue by the Customs and
Excise Department improved in the last quarter of 2003 and continued at a high
level into January and February 2004.

period, and the need to further stabilize the exchange rate.
The authorities agree to the publication of the staff report.

Introduction

We thank staff for the candid discussions held with the authorities and the set of reports.
Favorable conditions in the agricultural sector during the period 1998-2001, led to an average
GDP growth rate of 6 percent and an average inflation rate of below 3 percent. During 2002,
however, GDP contracted as a result of a fall in groundnut production due largely to
unfavorable weather conditions but it recovered in 2003. The economy remains highly
vulnerable to external shocks.
2.

Developments during 2002 and 2003

In 2002, GDP fell by about 3 percent. However, despite this decline, strong growth was
registered in the construction and the services sector. Tourism, the re-export trade, and
groundnuts provided the main sources of foreign exchange revenue. Most of the population,
however, remain dependent on agriculture which is highly susceptible to the vagaries of the
weather. Within the manufacturing sector, groundnut processing benefited from additional
capacity due to the availability of a good crop in 2001. As a result of high monetary growth,

-2nominal exchange rate declined and inflation rose to 13 percent year on year. The current
account deficit (excluding grants) was estimated to be about 13 percent of GDP in 2002.The
overall fiscal deficit (excluding grants) reached 8.1 percent of GDP in 2002, although the
basic primary fiscal surplus fell only slightly short of its target level at 2.7 percent of GDP.
The authorities shifted budget execution to a cash basis with the creation of the National
Emergency Fiscal Committee (NEFCOM) to monitor and approve expenditure allocations.
Other measures taken by the authorities include the elimination of government subsidies,
doubling of fuel prices, increase in selected excise taxes and the raising of administrative fees
for various services.
In 2003, heavy and sustained rain, which facilitated full recovery in agricultural output led to
real GDP growth of 8.8 percent. However, the local currency, the dalasi depreciated by 34
percent in nominal terms with inflation rising to 18 percent as a result of a drop in groundnut
exports and barriers in the re-export trade due to the border problems with neighboring
Senegal. The fiscal deficit, excluding grants declined to 6 percent due to unfavorable
performance of projected revenue receipts. Monetary growth increased due largely to the
entire financing of fiscal deficit by the CBG. The progressive increase in interest rates
compelled the authorities to take measures to support monetary tightening by extending the
requirements for minimum reserves to include foreign currency deposits.
3.

Structural Reforms undertaken

The Central Revenue Department successfully took over the administration of the sales tax
from the Customs and Excise Department. Majority of the below-the-line accounts were
eliminated. A draft organic budget law, expected to help clarify and put in place procedures
and responsibilities for public sector fiscal management is to be discussed by the cabinet
prior to its submission to the National Assembly. Regulatory reforms in the financial sector
have been strengthened through the passage of the Financial Institutions, Insurance and
Money Laundering Acts. In addition, three out of the five structural benchmarks under the
first annual program under the PRGF arrangement were completed before time. Furthermore,
the Trade Gateway Project was launched with World Bank support and the Free Zones
Authority of The Gambia was established, to facilitate growth in exports.
The authorities launched “operation no compromise” to address unfair business practices and
poor governance. Furthermore, the authorities have taken legal action against tax evasion and
fraud by several businesses as well as alleged collaborators. Five senior officials of the CBG
were also indicted for offences relating to foreign currency transactions.
4.

Macroeconomic Policies and Developments for 2003 - 2005

Suspension of donor support will have adverse impact on the fiscal deficit which is projected
to increase as a result of increased reliance on bank financing. However, the authorities are
committed to taking decisive action to correct the growing fiscal imbalances to be supported
by the recent substantial improvement in external competitiveness, and the possible
exploitation of offshore hydrocarbon deposits that would help in the diversification of the

-3economy. As natural shocks cannot be predicted, favorable trends in donor and external
inflows, foreign direct investment and expansion in regional trade would ensure the
achievement of sustained GDP growth rates at 6 percent as outlined in the PRSP for 20022005, and make it possible to meet targets of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
a.

Fiscal Policy

The authorities, realize the benefits of achieving macroeconomic stability and are committed
to implement revenue measures to reduce the fiscal financing gap projected at about 9
percent of GDP for 2004, in the absence of external budgetary support. They would broaden
the sales tax base and raise the applicable rate to imported goods in line with domestic
services. They will also undertake measures to reduce spending, and increase revenues,
especially in the tourism and re-export sectors, as these will have a positive impact on the
exchange rate. The authorities will also enforce revenue collection measures, especially
collection of tax arrears and would redress the shortcomings in customs procedures and tax
exemption regime. As outlined in the 2004 budget, licensing and other fees will be increased
and it is expected that such action will yield an additional revenue of about 0.7 percent of
GDP in 2004.
b.

Monetary and exchange rate policy

The banking sector remains reasonably healthy. Non performing loans and provisioning
considered as indicators of financial sector stability are also stable. The Central Bank of The
Gambia will continue to tighten monetary policy. The authorities will continue to pursue
measures that would ensure favorable rates of interest to reduce the overshooting in monetary
aggregates including reducing bank borrowing and encouraging the no-banking sector to
increase its holdings of government treasury bills, thereby impacting on expansion in private
sector credit. The CBG will focus attention on streamlining foreign exchange operating
procedures of the bank by separating back-office from trading functions, provision of clear
investment guidelines with regards to foreign exchange and ensuring effective control
procedures.
c.

Structural Reforms

In order to take advantage of the country’s open trading policy that has created opportunities
for diversification of the economy, the authorities are determined to address the deficiencies
in infrastructure, especially in the provision of electricity, water as well as attract private
finance to investors. They will continue with the privatization program, encourage the
microfinance sector and ensure implementation of needed reforms in the land tenure system.
Improvements will also be made in the legal and judicial areas considered crucial to building
investor confidence and the protection of property rights.
They will ensure a speedy review of the CBG Act as well as facilitate the process for the
independence of the central bank from the government with full accountability.
The establishment of the Revenue Authority scheduled for mid-2004 will be accelerated to
enable it to benefit from the creation of a large taxpayer unit with assistance from the IMF
and World Bank.

-45.

The PRSP and HIPC Initiative

Implementation of the PRSP and progress towards meeting targets of the MDGs during the
last two years have been hampered by crop failures of 2002, resulting in rising inflation and
declining resources for spending on social services and poverty reduction. Financial support
from the international community would have ensured that linkages between PRSP
objectives and budget execution are strengthened to achieve growth targets. However, given
the substantial shortfall of donor assistance in the pledges in support of the PRSP the
authorities are facing a big shortage in resources for financing the PRSP priorities, and other
recurrent expenditure needs. This development envisages a delay in meeting the HIPC
completion point.
However, despite the above developments, the authorities have made considerable effort in
financing social priority sectors which have shown marked improvements, namely; gross
school enrollment rates at the lower basic and secondary levels for girls and immunization
rates as well as provision of basic health facilities.
6.

Non-complying disbursement

Weaknesses in the operational accounting and internal control procedures in the CBG were
the primary causes of the misreporting that have led to the non-complying disbursements.
The authorities have expressed their strong commitment to addressing these weaknesses to
ensure safeguarding all resources at the disposal of the Bank. A series of measures have
already been taken to enforce the immediate payment by foreign exchange bureaus of the
overdue foreign currency through imposition of financial penalties. Legal action has been
taken on defaulting forex bureaus and new foreign exchange bureau licensing regulations are
being enforced. Several senior management personnel at the CBG have been replaced,
including the Governor as well as the respective heads of the foreign exchange, financial
control, and research departments. Other measures include the tightening of policy in the
second half of 2003 which has led to a slow down in the rapid depreciation of the dalasi and
moderate inflation.
In order to address the concerns on the quality of the previous audits of the CBG, the
authorities have agreed to invite Fund staff to discuss the re-audit for financial years 2001
and 2002, including a separate and independent examination of the CBG external reserves to
facilitate conducting the special audit.
Given the pattern of very low foreign exchange inflows into the country, particularly during
the June to October 2004 period, and the need to further stabilize the exchange rate, the
authorities are requesting to be allowed a period of twelve months within which to repay the
non-complying disbursement.
7.

Conclusion

The authorities are committed to implementing sound economic policies despite these
unexpected setbacks they are experiencing. They are making efforts to address all issues in
full cooperation with the Fund staff including adoption of an appropriate macroeconomic

-5framework for 2003 and beyond. The authorities intend to intensify efforts to build upon the
gains already made to ensure fiscal prudence, strengthen governance, and implement broadbased economic and financial reforms to reduce poverty and achieve sustainable growth.
They hope they can continue to count on the understanding and support of the IMF and
indeed the rest of the international community in this endeavor.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Concludes 2003 Article IV Consultation with The Gambia
On March 8, 2004, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with The Gambia.1
Background
Economic performance in The Gambia deteriorated substantially in 2002-2003. A collapse of
the groundnut harvest in 2002 led to a contraction of real GDP by 3 percent while also affecting
export revenues in 2003. At the same time, poor execution of monetary and fiscal policy,
reflecting serious deficiencies in governance, caused the exchange rate to depreciate and
inflation to surge: the dalasi depreciated by 60 percent in terms of the euro and by 45 percent in
terms of the dollar in the two years to end December 2003, and the consumer price index rose
by 18 percent in the year to December 2003. Critical quantitative performance targets and
benchmarks under the IMF’s Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement were
missed and the program is now far off track.
In 2002, the reported overall fiscal deficit (excluding grants) reached 8.1 percent of GDP,
compared with a target of 5.0 percent. Reserve money grew by 34 percent during the year,
reflecting both the fiscal deficit and liquidity injections by the Central Bank of The Gambia (CBG)
associated with foreign exchange losses. These losses resulted in part from questionable
currency transactions by the CBG with local foreign exchange bureaus involving exceptionally

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of
the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2wide spreads. The lax monetary conditions in turn gave rise to a 70 percent increase in credit to
the private sector and a 35 percent increase in broad money during 2002.
The government instituted some corrective measures during 2002 and 2003. Fuel prices were
raised substantially from October 2002 to eliminate associated fiscal losses and a new National
Emergency Fiscal Committee was created to monitor and approve expenditure allocations on a
weekly basis. The majority of below-the-line government accounts were also closed. These
actions helped to curtail unbudgeted spending and restrict the growth of noninterest current
expenditure below budget projections. Treasury bill yields were raised from 15 percent in July
2002 to 31 percent by September 2003 and, starting in April 2003; minimum reserve
requirements on deposits held by commercial banks were extended to include foreign currency
as well as dalasi deposits and were increased in two steps from 14 percent to 18 percent.
In 2003, the fiscal deficit is estimated to have declined to 6.0 percent of GDP, compared with a
budget target of 4.5 percent. Domestic revenue is estimated to have undershot the budget in
2003 by 2.7 percent of GDP, almost entirely due to a weaker than expected performance by the
Customs and Excise Department in the first nine months of the year, but there was also
compression in public expenditure. The fiscal deficit (including grants) was financed in full by
the central bank, fuelling an increase in reserve money of 63 percent during the year. Broad
money grew by 43 percent.
The authorities informed the IMF staff in October 2003 of a series of substantial errors in data
transmitted to the IMF for the period 2001-2003: (i) US$28.5 million of public spending from the
foreign exchange reserves had not been recorded in central government or central bank
accounts in 2001; (ii) the foreign exchange reserves had been wrongly credited during 20012003 with receipts of up to US$16 million from foreign exchange bureaus which had not been
delivered, and (iii) nearly US$2 million in payments from the foreign exchange reserves for
commissions on various external transactions had not been reported. Including these items in
government accounts would, inter alia: (i) raise the level of public expenditure from 24 percent
to 31 percent of GDP in 2001; (ii) raise the fiscal deficit (excluding grants) in 2001 from
8 percent to 15 percent of GDP; and (iii) reduce the level of gross official foreign exchange
reserves at end-2003 from around 7 months of imports’ cover to around 4½ months.
Progress with structural reforms in 2002-03 was limited. To facilitate export growth, the Trade
Gateway Project was launched with World Bank support and The Gambia Investment and Free
Zones Authority was established. The Gambia became eligible in January 2003 for preferential
access under the U.S. African Growth and Opportunities Act. However, little was achieved on
privatization or on the improvements in central bank governance and statistics identified under
the Technical Cooperation Action Plan with the IMF.
Weaknesses persisted in all areas of fiscal management. In particular the planning, execution
and monitoring of public expenditure was impeded by the failure to audit the fiscal accounts
since 1991, to close and finalize the fiscal accounts beyond 1999, and to complete entries into
the general ledger beyond November 2001.

-3In 2001, The Gambia ranked 149th on the human development index. It is likely that poverty
has increased markedly since 2001, owing to the crop failures of 2002, rising inflation, and
limited provision of income support and social services. Macroeconomic performance has fallen
well short of the framework laid out in The Gambia’s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP).
The completion point under the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative
cannot now be reached before 2005, at the earliest. The first progress report on the PRSP is
scheduled for completion in early 2004.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors observed that sustained shortcomings in governance and the conduct of economic
policy, compounded by poor weather in 2002, had contributed to a deteriorating macroeconomic
performance in The Gambia in recent years. They noted, with concern that the rising rates of
monetary growth since 2000, reflecting the Central Bank of The Gambia’s financing of high
fiscal deficits, quasi-fiscal expenditure, and central bank losses, had led to a sharp depreciation
in the exchange rate and a surge in inflation. At the same time, policy and governance concerns
held up external budgetary assistance. They saw these conditions as contributing to an
increase in poverty and to setting back the country’s medium-term development strategy.
Directors observed that restoring macroeconomic stability and re-establishing the conditions for
sustainable growth and poverty reduction requires resolute actions on the authorities’ part to
improve governance, without which no sustained improvement in economic conditions is
possible, and to enhance the management of fiscal and monetary policy, and to pursue
structural reforms.
Directors stressed the urgency of combating incipient inflationary pressures by taking immediate
measures to tighten fiscal and monetary policy. They observed that, despite efforts to rein in
public expenditure through cash budgeting, fiscal slippages had continued throughout the
period, boosted by large unbudgeted spending. They saw the need to rein in the budget deficit,
which is projected to rise in 2004, to reduce financing demands on the CBG and crowding out of
private investment.
In this regard, Directors welcomed the recent improvement in the control of cash outlays on
non-interest, non-wage expenditures by the National Emergency Fiscal Committee (NEFCOM)
and measures to strengthen tax administration. They looked forward to passage of the organic
budget law and further controls over spending as well as the formation of the Revenue Authority
and a large taxpayer unit in 2004, reinforced by further efforts to collect arrears and improve
customs procedures and the administration of duty exemptions. Most Directors also
recommended revenue raising measures, including broadening the sales tax base and raising
its rate on imported goods, and enhancing taxation of the tourist and re-export sectors. They
noted the importance of minimizing any potential adverse effects on the poor.
Directors also stressed the need to strengthen monetary policy, and the vital importance of
improving the CBG’s internal organization, procedures, and controls. To help achieve the
monetary growth targets, they recommended that the authorities use greater flexibility in interest

-4rates and strictly enforce reserve requirements. While recognizing the urgent need to increase
holding of official bills by the private sector, some Directors advised separating liquidity
management from government debt management, and in particular, reducing reliance on
primary issuance of treasury bills for liquidity management. Directors underscored the
importance of reviewing the Central Bank of The Gambia Act with a view to ensuring its
conformity with a modern central bank law, and within this context, providing more operational
independence for the CBG.
Directors expressed strong disappointment with the authorities for the serious misstatements in
data previously provided to the Fund for the period 2001-2003, and the inadequate provision of
detailed revisions to Fund staff. They welcomed the recently expressed willingness of the
authorities to discuss measures with Fund staff to verify the CBG’s financial statements and the
foreign exchange reserves, but stressed the need to conduct a special audit covering the CBG’s
foreign exchange activities since end-2000 and a re-audit of the 2001 and 2002 financial
statements. Directors also underscored the need for improvements in management of the CBG
to prevent a recurrence of losses, such as those incurred in recent foreign exchange
transactions.
Directors emphasized that the country’s compliance with the Fund’s safeguards assessment
policy is critical to regaining access to Fund resources. They stressed the need for the CBG to
comply rigorously with agreed disclosure and accounting procedures so that regular monitoring
of monetary developments, including provision of data to the Fund, could be fully resumed.
To further strengthen disclosure, Directors also advocated immediate measures to bring the
recording of government accounts up to date and to close expeditiously the accounts from 2000
onwards; they indicated that there should be no further delay in the auditing of the 1991-99
accounts. As poor economic data have seriously impaired the assessment of recent economic
developments and policy adjustments, Directors emphasized the urgency of improving the
quality of a wide range of economic statistics. They noted also their concern whether The
Gambia is meeting the provisions of Article VIII, Section 5. Directors strongly urged the
resumption of systematic publication of economic data.
Directors noted that medium-term prospects, in particular for raising the living standards of the
poor, would continue to depend largely on the performance of agriculture, including groundnuts.
They observed that a coordinated policy approach to ensure the security of high-quality seed
supply and other agricultural inputs, and extended irrigation schemes and improved marketing
arrangements could lessen substantially the adverse impact of inevitable weather-related
shocks.
Directors also stressed the need for improved access to finance for smallholders, as well as,
more generally, for small and medium-sized enterprises. They assessed that the recent sharp
decline in the real exchange rate had substantially increased export incentives and had thereby
improved prospects for the long-overdue diversification of the economy. They added that a
resumption of the stalled privatization program and the implementation of measures under

-5consideration to provide redress against abuse of property or contractual rights would further
improve the business environment.
Directors regretted that the program supported by the PRGF had gone far off track during 2003,
and that prospect for reaching the completion point under the enhanced HIPC Initiative had
receded. They observed that if the authorities take actions to address the deteriorating
economic situation and major governance issues, this would facilitate a resumption of
discussions, leading to further possible support under a PRGF arrangement.
Directors noted that technical assistance, including that under the Technical Cooperation Action
plan, would help improve the quality of monetary and fiscal institutions, and also of essential
statistics. In view of the assistance the authorities have already received, they stressed that
resolute action is now needed to implement previous recommendations.

Public Information Notices (PINs) are issued, (i) at the request of a member country, following the
conclusion of the Article IV consultation for countries seeking to make known the views of the IMF to the
public. This action is intended to strengthen IMF surveillance over the economic policies of member
countries by increasing the transparency of the IMF's assessment of these policies; and (ii) following
policy discussions in the Executive Board at the decision of the Board. The Staff Report for the 2003
Article IV Consultation with The Gambia is also available.
