KINGDOM OF THE NETHERLANDS—NETHERLANDS
Staff Report for the 2004 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives
for the 2004 Consultation with the Netherlands
Approved by Ajai Chopra and Michael T. Hadjimichael
July 21, 2004
The 2004 Article IV discussions were held in Amsterdam and The Hague during May 27–June 7, 2004, and
included the conclusions and recommendations of the recent FSAP. The staff team comprised Messrs. Feldman
(head), Bell, and Hofman, Ms. Zhou (all EUR), and Mr. Swinburne (MFD). It met with the Finance Minister,
the Governor and other representatives of the central bank (DNB) and financial supervision, senior staff of
several government ministries and agencies, including the Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis (CPB), the
Competition Authority (NMa), and the head of the Social and Economic Council, representatives of labor
unions and employer organizations, banking and pension fund economists, and academics.
After early elections in January 2003, a center right coalition government comprising the Christian Democrats,
Liberals, and the center-left D66 took office in May 2003; its term is through 2007.
In concluding the 2003 Article IV consultation on July 30, 2003, Executive Directors expressed concern about
the significant slowdown in economic activity since 2000 and the sharp deterioration in the fiscal position.
While commending the government for taking measures to strengthen the public finances over the medium term,
Directors identified raising the employment rate and carrying out further product market reform as key structural
issues.
The quality of policies in the Netherlands has been favorably recognized by the Fund for some time. During the
1980s and 1990s, consistent with the Fund’s emphasis on fiscal discipline and structural reforms, it was possible
both to cut taxes and turn large fiscal deficits into surpluses as a result of tight control over public expenditures.
At the same time, incentives to work were enhanced by labor market reforms; wage moderation was supported
by cuts in taxes and social security contributions; competitiveness was thereby strengthened; unemployment fell
sharply as the economy grew; and reforms in financial and other product markets reinforced these positive
outcomes. However, the implementation of measures supported by the Fund in recent years to raise labor
participation and productivity and consolidate the public finances have become all the more important in light of
the depth of the recent economic slowdown and the accompanying deterioration in the fiscal position.
The Netherlands accepted the obligations under Article VIII and, apart from certain security restrictions,
maintains an exchange system free of restrictions (Appendix I). It subscribes to the Fund’s Special Data
Dissemination Standard and data provision is timely and adequate for surveillance purposes (Appendix II).
The authorities released the mission’s concluding statement and agreed to the publication of the staff report.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background and outlook: The economy is beginning to emerge from an extended
downturn. Improving exports are driving the recovery, while domestic demand is expected to
take longer to recover. Downside risks to the outlook for growth, especially from domestic
sources, are a concern in the context of the nascent recovery. Meanwhile, against a
background of soft labor market conditions and economic slack generally, inflationary
pressures are low. With the general government balance deteriorating by almost 5½
percentage points of GDP between 2000 and 2003 and breaching the 3 percent Maastricht
ceiling in the latter year, the authorities are determined to bring the deficit below 3 percent of
GDP in 2004. Various structural reforms are in the works, but discord on certain plans has
led to a marked cooling of the relationship between the government and social partners.
Policy discussions centered on the following key issues:
•
The fiscal policy stance to nurture the emerging recovery while ensuring fiscal
sustainability. Staff estimated that the 2004 deficit will narrow in underlying structural terms
by 0.6 percentage point of GDP. This adjustment would strike an appropriate balance
between the need to consolidate the public finances and avoid disruptions to the recovery. All
agreed on the goal of sustaining fiscal consolidation in the medium term, with a view to
preparing for aging and buttressing confidence.
•
The operations of the expenditure-based fiscal framework. Among recent rule
changes, one is aimed at avoiding the use of cyclical expenditure windfalls to fund permanent
spending increases—as had happened in recent periods. Staff was supportive but preferred a
stronger formulation of the expenditure rule to preclude new spending. Also, staff stressed
that enhancing the transparency of the expenditure ceilings would facilitate their accessibility
to a broader audience, adding an additional element of clarity and discipline to the system.
•
With a view to the challenges of aging, the need to boost potential growth by
raising participation and productivity. Important progress is being made: the authorities
have planned a major overhaul of the disability scheme—a long-acknowledged haven of
hidden unemployment—and the abolition of tax incentives for early retirement (both
effective from 2006). While the mission welcomed these steps, it urged that reforms be
undertaken in a comprehensive way—notably including the unemployment insurance scheme
(where reform plans were more limited)—to avoid shifts from one category of inactivity into
another. Staff also pointed to the potential benefits of reducing the minimum wage and
increasing wage dispersion. The authorities acknowledged the economic reasoning behind
these recommendations, but considered implementation politically difficult in light of a
cultural preference for an egalitarian wage distribution.
•
The health of the financial system. The FSAP found that, overall, the financial
system is sound, resilient to adverse shocks, and well supervised.

-5-

I. BACKGROUND
1.
The Dutch economy has experienced a pronounced boom-and-bust cycle since the
mid-1990s—with the boom accompanied by a build up of macroeconomic imbalances and
a loss of competitiveness. Growth averaged 3.6 percent during 1995–2000, but then declined
steadily to average only 0.2 percent during 2001–03; unemployment and inflation broadly
mirrored this pattern, albeit with a lag (Table 1 and Figure 1). The comprehensive economic
reforms that started in the 1980s helped lay the foundation for robust growth by raising
incentives to work, expanding the labor force, and buttressing competitiveness. This
contributed to buoyant export growth while capital spending expanded sharply. However, by
the end of the 1990s, the economy was overheating: the unemployment rate fell below the
estimated NAIRU of about 4 percent; and wage pressures—long pent-up under successive
economy-wide wage-moderation agreements—surfaced in force in the late 1990s, fueling a
significant bout of wage inflation (Figure 2). This put upward pressure on consumer prices
(with inflation peaking at over 5 percent in 2001) and weakened external competitiveness—
though trade shares have been fairly stable since the mid-1990s (Figure 3).
2.
The unwinding of imbalances, along with a weakening external environment,
contributed to the sharp slowdown of activity in recent years—with growth turning
negative in 2003 for the first time in twenty years. Investment declined significantly as the
rapid growth earlier was based on what now appears to have been unrealistic expectations of
future economic growth (Figure 4). The collapse of equity prices (Figure 5) weakened
corporate balance sheets, another factor dampening investment. Meanwhile, export growth
fell off sharply as the impact of weak external demand was accentuated by the appreciation of
the euro and especially the lagged effects of the rapid growth in wage costs. As wage growth
moderated and social security contributions were increased, private consumption growth also
fell and became negative in 2003, also reflecting uncertainties over pensions, future reforms,
and employment prospects.
3.
Wealth and policy effects amplified the cycle. Wealth effects were larger than in
most other countries in the euro area, with the DNB estimating that asset and housing price
increases added an average of 1–1½ percentage points to real GDP growth between 1998 and
2000. This was a key factor explaining the comparative resilience of Dutch private
consumption through 2001. Meanwhile, the private sector became increasingly indebted
(Figure 6). Rising housing prices, the low interest rate environment, and mortgage products
which maximize tax write-offs by delaying principal repayments led to households raising
their debt ratio from 109 percent of disposable income in 1995 to some 200 percent in 2002.
On the policy front, the sensitivity of pension fund regulation to market conditions in
assessing solvency, and the pension funds' exposure to equities, may have also amplified the
cycle: contribution rates were cut during the stock market boom of the late 1990s, only to be

-6-

hiked during the bust in recent years.1 This exacerbated the adverse effect on labor costs
arising from the delayed response of wages to labor market conditions.2 While the monetary
stance is broadly appropriate for the Netherlands’ at the current economic conjuncture, it was
too loose through much of the late 1990s, contributing to the boom.3

Inflation is now tame, and there is little

disability and unemployment benefits and early
retirement. While agreement for 2005 has now collapsed because of discord on some aspects
of these reforms (discussed later), the appreciated euro, generally subdued pace of economic
activity, and slack labor market conditions are expected by the Dutch authorities and staff to
keep a lid on price and wage pressures. The latter will have favorable effects on
competitiveness.
5.
The fiscal balance deteriorated markedly. Between 2000 and 2003, the general
government balance worsened by almost 5½ percentage points of GDP as a result of both
cyclical and structural effects (Table 2). Structural effects—amounting to roughly
2 percentage points of GDP—included the 2001 tax reform and increases in health care and
education spending. The deficit in 2003 was larger than the initial target of 2.3 percent of
GDP and ended up breaching the 3 percent Maastricht ceiling. Slower-than-expected growth
reduced revenue and, after years of running close to balance, the local governments
1

Average contribution rates were increased by 4 percentage points from 2001 to 2004, to
some 14 percent.

2

While delivering wage moderation on average, the Dutch wage bargaining system has
tended to react sluggishly to changes in economic circumstances. This was analyzed in Wage
Bargaining in the Netherlands (IMF Country Paper No. 03/240).

Compared with current Taylor-rule estimates of a broadly appropriate monetary stance for
the Netherlands, the OECD estimates that short-term interest rates in the late 1990s were
3 percentage points lower than indicated by a Taylor-rule relationship.

-7-

surprisingly recorded a deficit of 0.6 percent of GDP in 2003. In addition, although the
spending ceilings were met through 2002, temporary expenditure windfalls were used to fund
permanent increases in other spending. As a result, in the new coalition agreement in 2003,
there was a modest ratcheting up of the ceiling, which was also exceeded by a small margin.
II. REPORT ON THE POLICY DISCUSSIONS
6.
Discussions focused on the key short- and medium-term challenges of nurturing
the emerging recovery and enhancing prospects for growth and fiscal sustainability in the
face of an aging population. While fiscal policy needs to be well anchored in a convincing
medium-term framework to bolster confidence, an important near-term issue, in light of
short-run fragilities, was striking the right balance between needed fiscal adjustment on the
one hand and avoiding disruptions to the recovery on the other. All agreed on the longer-term
benefits of raising both the labor participation rate and productivity. Decisively implementing
reforms to achieve these objectives would be mutually reinforcing in creating employment,
enhancing competitiveness, boosting potential growth, and achieving fiscal saving to ensure
adequate resources for an aging population. The authorities, as described below, are in fact
moving ahead with important reforms, though political resistance is a damper to the more
extensive efforts recommended by staff.
A. Economic Performance and Near-Term Outlook
7.
There was consensus that the long-awaited recovery is now in train—but with slow
growth expected at least through the current year. Staff projected growth of about 1 percent
in 2004 and about 1¾ percent in 2005. The latest growth projections (released after the
mission) of the CPB and the DNB appear somewhat wide ranging: the central bank forecasts
¾ and 2 percent, respectively, for 2004 and 2005; the CPB 1¼ percent for both years. The
difference mainly reflects diverging views on the strength of private consumption. In all the
projections, improving exports, with needed support from continued wage moderation, were
seen as the main driver—contributing to a gradual pickup in investment.4 Moreover,
macroeconomic policy settings were considered appropriate: notwithstanding fiscal
tightening (see below), the ECB policy rate (Figure 8) was seen as broadly in line with the
requirements of the Dutch economy (being, as noted before, Taylor-rule consistent).
8.
Various uncertainties to the outlook were acknowledged, with staff emphasizing
downside risks. In the staff’s view, downside risks from domestic fragilities were especially
pronounced. In particular, staff pointed to households’ exposure to income and interest rate
risk, noting that a combination of faster-than-expected increases in interest rates and
unemployment could trigger a drop in housing prices. More generally, with weak near-term

levels. The possibility of a stronger-than-expected external recovery was also recognized,
with the authorities additionally indicating that investment could surprise on the upside
because of this and if business confidence were to remain buoyant (Figure 9). Nevertheless,
the authorities concurred that even if upside and downside events were about evenly
balanced, the potential impact of the downside was relatively larger in magnitude and a
matter of concern.
B. Fiscal Policy
9.
The authorities have taken a series of measures to comply with the 3 percent
Maastricht ceiling in the current year (text table). These included various packages to try to
bring the 2004 deficit from an estimated 3.8 percent of GDP at the time of the budget was
published (in September 2003) to 2.3 percent. However, as shown in the table and discussed
in ¶5, the outturn for 2003 (a deficit of 3.2 percent) was worse than envisaged when the 2004
budget was prepared. This, along with slower-than-expected growth in 2004, resulted in a
revised projection for the 2004 deficit (of 3.4 percent). Thus, additional measures were taken
in the 2004 spring budget memorandum to just meet the 3 percent ceiling. Overall, measures
of close to 2 percent of GDP barely stabilize the deficit at the 3 percent ceiling. The measures
do lead to a ½ percent of GDP narrowing of the structural deficit. The balance is taken up by
a ½ percent of cyclical weakening and 1 percent of structural weakening (health care, local
authority spending, and shortfalls in corporate tax receipts). The staff viewed the correction
of the structural deficit as striking an appropriate balance between the need to consolidate the
public finances and avoid disruptions to the recovery.

10.
The authorities are addressing certain risks to the execution of the 2004 budget.
They explained that they were caught off guard by the deterioration in the local authorities’
overall fiscal balance. To better coordinate the execution of the central and local
governments’ budgets in 2004, they have established regular contacts with large
municipalities, especially on their net lending activities (mostly related to net purchases of
land). Staff noted that the large rises in health care spending amid a shift to a more demanddriven system raised other concerns. In addition to recent measures to contain health care
costs (for instance, benchmarking and higher co-payments), staff therefore also welcomed the
suggestion in last year’s coalition agreement to consider reimposing direct budgetary controls
on health care spending if necessary.
11.
With a view to bolstering confidence and taking advantage of the cyclical upturn to
prepare for the cost of aging, there is a need for sustained fiscal consolidation in the
medium term. In this context, the authorities had stipulated in the initial 2004 budget that the
structural deficit should not exceed 0.5 percent of GDP in 2007 and targeted cumulative
underlying adjustment of 0.7 percentage point of GDP between 2003 and 2007. Measures
included modest base-broadening tax policies, a cut of 10,000 civil servants, a general cut in
subsidies, a reduction in the coverage of the basic public healthcare package, and compulsory
private health insurance starting in 2006. While the fiscal position has worsened since the
budget was prepared, the government has not yet revised its target. Staff, for its part,
advocated structural adjustment of at least 0.5 percentage point of GDP per year through the
government’s term (2007), also with a view to the longer-term aspects of aging (see ¶12).
This would imply aiming for about structural balance by the end of the current government’s
term in 2007 and a limit of about 1 percent on the average growth of real primary expenditure

- 10 -

during 2003–07, compared with actual average growth of 3.2 percent in the four years
to 2003.5 In identifying additional measures, staff encouraged the authorities to consider areas
that would improve incentives for work and offer complementarities to product and labor
market reforms, including through the tax-benefits system and phasing out mortgage interest
deductions over the medium term, which could also limit rent subsidies.
12.
The authorities’ fiscal strategy on aging for the medium and longer term entails
running down debt to use the saving on interest payments to cover higher aging costs.
Appendix III presents long-term debt and fiscal sustainability scenarios in the context of this
and other strategies, finding the situation is manageable but requires sustained fiscal
adjustment.
13.
The discussions turned to the operations of the fiscal framework and possible
avenues to help secure continued adjustment, anchored by the medium-term expenditure
ceilings.6
●
The authorities pointed to recent improvements: the decision, welcomed by staff, to
devote revenue windfalls solely to debt reduction, thus avoiding a procyclical bias from the
past; and the intention that cyclical expenditure windfalls (related, for example, to
unemployment and other social spending) will not be used to fund spending on other items
without further consideration. While recognizing the difficulty in determining whether
spending windfalls are cyclical, staff preferred a stronger formulation of the latter to preclude
new spending.
●
With a view to reinforcing fiscal discipline, staff also supported the authorities’
renewed intention of not allowing reallocation across the spending subceilings—an approach
that has not been followed consistently in practice as below-ceiling expenditure in one
category has been used to accommodate overspending in another.
●
Staff considered that enhancing the transparency of the ceilings would facilitate their
accessibility to a broader audience, adding an additional element of clarity and discipline to
the system. In this regard, staff saw merit in aligning the spending ceilings more closely with
national accounts concepts, and focusing the ceilings solely on spending by discontinuing the
practice of treating nontax revenues as negative expenditures. More transparent and
accessible ceilings would also help in communicating policy, with the potential advantage of

5

While such an expenditure limit would be tough, it would be less stringent than might first
appear because it rebases to the high growth of preceding years.

enhancing confidence.7 The authorities saw staff recommendations on the latter point as
worthy of further consideration. It was also noted that significant revisions to the system
would best be made every four years when a new government sets out to explain its fiscal
policy intentions.
●
Wide-ranging health sector reforms, to be introduced in 2006, carry the prospect of
greater choice and efficiency in meeting the needs of patients. However, in light of the
uncertainties over how resource demands will evolve in practice and the experience with
overruns in the past, staff was of the view that cost control may continue to be a budgetary
issue. There was general agreement on the need to reduce reporting lags in the health sector,
with the authorities indicating that efforts were already underway in this connection.
C. Boosting Potential Growth
14.
Fiscal consolidation aside, meeting the challenges of looming population aging
would be helped by boosting potential growth. The authorities and the staff agreed that
recent growth performance was weighed down by low participation of specific groups in the
Dutch labor market as well as a secular decline in productivity growth.
Raising labor market participation
15.
While low participation has been persistent for particular groups, some proposed
reforms are stretching the limits of the “polder” model of social consensus. The tight labor
market of the late 1990s and its attendant adverse implications for competitiveness highlight
the importance of boosting labor supply. Participation is especially low among older, partially
disabled, and low-skilled workers, and the authorities and staff viewed policies related to
disability and sickness benefits, early retirement, and inactivity traps as particularly relevant.
Administrative aspects of benefits systems were also seen as important. In this regard, the
authorities reported on the success of the recent decentralization, which reduced inflows into
welfare, as an encouraging illustration of the potential gains from setting the right incentives.8
Most government officials and staff also agreed on the merits of undertaking reforms in a
comprehensive way, notably including the unemployment insurance scheme, to avoid the risk
of shifts from one category of inactivity to another. However, initiating such reform is already
proving difficult in the context of the consensus-oriented policy model: the debate within
7

For example, there was concern that the string of deficit-reducing spending measures
enacted over the last two years could be misinterpreted as an over tightening of policy. The
interpretation would more likely be in line with policy intentions when seen as responding to
an initial loosening and bringing spending back within rising expenditure under the pre-set
ceilings.

8

These included incentives to favor reintegration into the labor force over welfare benefits as
municipalities could keep unused funds from their social welfare budget.

- 12 -

government on reforming unemployment insurance is still ongoing; and, following recent
discussions on the reform of early retirement, the government’s relationship with the social
partners has cooled to the point that the labor unions have withdrawn from their commitment
to a wage freeze in 2005.
16.
The government is moving ahead with the removal of fiscal incentives for early
retirement. In addition to making participation in collective early retirement schemes
voluntary, the government intends to implement its original plan to fully abolish the tax
deductibility of early retirement savings and has announced its intention to suspend the
administrative extension to unorganized firms of those parts of wage contracts that require
participation in early retirement schemes. While staff saw the changes as fostering greater
intergenerational and actuarial fairness in early retirement arrangements, these plans had
caused major upset with the trade unions, who saw disadvantages for older workers.9 In a
broader context, the mission suggested that the official retirement age (currently 65, with the
effective retirement age around 61 years) take into account changes in life expectancy
(Figure 10).
17.
Disability is a long-acknowledged haven of hidden unemployment and the sheer
size of current disability schemes underscores the urgency of implementing reform plans.
Disability schemes harbor close to one million beneficiaries, equivalent to about 13 percent
of employment. The authorities considered that some partial reforms over the last few years
(for example, the introduction of a gatekeeper function and so-called experience-rated
insurance premia based on firms’ existing participation in disability schemes) had contributed
to the recent decline in new applicants. They were also planning a more sweeping overhaul,
which aims to restrict access only to the fully disabled while introducing stricter criteria and
examinations. For the partially disabled, incentives to work would be substantially
strengthened, to foster their reintegration into the workforce.10 The mission welcomed these
plans, stressing that in addition to durably and significantly reducing new inflows, it would be
important to rigorously reassess the existing stock of cases on the basis of the new criteria as
planned.
18.
The authorities have plans to further limit the generosity of unemployment
benefits. They have phased out the so-called follow-up unemployment benefit. This benefit
9

Collective early retirement schemes are more costly for younger workers because
contributions are paid over a longer period and assessed at a flat percentage rate of the
individual wage.
10

Under the new scheme, partially disabled who work would be entitled to a wage subsidy
bridging 70 percent of the difference between the old and new wage. By comparison, when
unemployed, the partially disabled would receive regular unemployment benefits and, after a
time, welfare.

- 13 -

had added another 2½ years to the (up to) 5 years of main benefits available and thereby had
acted as a channel to effectively retire at 57½ years of age. In addition, the authorities plan to
eliminate short-term benefits and tighten the eligibility requirements for the main
unemployment benefits. Staff encouraged the authorities to follow through with these plans.
However, it noted that further reform—in particular with respect to the relatively long
duration of the main unemployment benefits—would be beneficial.11 While further
buttressing incentives to work, such action would also tend to diminish the risk that a
tightening of other social security arrangements would result in a rise in applications for
unemployment benefits.
19.
Female participation is high, though associated with a large share of part-time
work. Workers are legally entitled to work part time with regular benefits and staff asked
whether, in the presence of fixed labor costs, such arrangements elevated the overall cost of
labor. The authorities, and various employers with whom staff talked, felt that part-time
arrangements were working very well. However, to raise hours worked, the authorities
stressed the need to strengthen certain incentives, notably through better and more available
childcare.
20.
High replacement rates and means-tested benefits imply significant inactivity traps
at the lower end of the wage scale. To reduce inactivity traps, the authorities are gradually
increasing the earned-income tax credit. However, in light of the associated high budgetary
costs and the still high (effective) marginal tax rates for low-wage earners who take a job,
staff suggested further measures, including a redesign of rent subsidies. Staff also pointed to
the potential benefits of lowering the minimum wage, which forms both the basis for
determining the level of several social benefits and directly limits labor demand at lower skill
levels. In particular, the mission argued that lowering inactivity traps and stimulating not only
labor supply but also the demand for low-skilled labor would seem particularly relevant in the
context of an aging population and the likely associated increase in demand for personal
services. The authorities noted the complex economic and political aspects of such a
comprehensive reform package and highlighted their plans to abolish certain local benefits
for specific groups as an area where there already was political consensus and administrative
capacity for substantial reform.

11

This is consistent with recent research by Coles and Masters (2004), “Duration-Dependent
Unemployment Insurance Payments and Equilibrium Unemployment,” Economica, Vol. 71,
who demonstrate adverse effects from a longer duration of unemployment benefits, even if
the overall generosity of unemployment insurance stays unchanged.

Reversing the decline in productivity growth
21.
In addition to raising participation,
potential growth would be enhanced by an
acceleration of productivity growth. While the
exact extent of the slowdown in productivity
growth is difficult to measure and the overall
level of productivity is comparatively high,12
the authorities and the staff agreed that
reversing the secular decline in productivity
growth would be an important element in
lifting the economy’s capacity to cope with
population aging.

With a view to recommending policies
that would boost innovation, productivity, and growth, the authorities have established the
high-level “Innovation Platform” under chairmanship of the Prime Minister. The mission
suggested that an important item on the agenda should be the removal of obstacles to a
quicker reallocation of resources into innovating sectors. In this context, the mission
welcomed the authorities’ stepped-up effort to reduce the administrative burden and
supported their intention to extend the focus of this effort to revising the specific content of
regulations.
•
The mission also suggested that focus be placed on labor markets where liberalization
efforts have in general lagged behind product market reform. Employment protection is still
at a comparatively high level, hinders flexibility, and serves as an implicit tax on new hiring.
Greater wage differentiation would, among other things, open a channel to realizing returns
from investment in human capital—a relevant complement to the government’s attempts to
raise the importance of private financing of higher education. It would also be helpful in
attracting labor to higher productivity companies and sectors.
•
While the authorities appreciated the reasoning behind these suggestions,
implementation was considered politically difficult, with traditional preferences for an
egalitarian wage distribution running counter to introducing greater wage differentiation.

12

An accompanying selected issues paper analyzes productivity developments in detail.
Among its findings are that productivity growth tends to be particularly low in heavily
protected sectors. The paper also notes evidence that Dutch companies engage in less risky
experimentation than, say, U.S. firms, which in turn may affect innovation and reflect the
regulatory burden in the Netherlands.

- 15 -

22.
The benefits from further improvements in the functioning of product markets
were also discussed. The staff and the authorities considered the Netherlands as being at the
forefront of product market reforms in Europe, including through the comprehensive opening
of most network sectors. Nevertheless, some sectors, for example construction and nontraded
services, have remained protected while also recording particularly weak productivity growth.
Against this background, the recently established competition agency (NMa) has quickly
gained credibility and begun to focus its enforcement efforts on these sectors. In addition, the
authorities saw benefits in persevering with efforts to open new avenues for competition in
markets with strong existing incumbents. Examples included the approval of new electricity
generation facilities and international transmission lines, and efforts to unbundle network
transmission and production. To further improve NMa’s effectiveness, staff supported
proposals to strengthen the agency’s powers to investigate and its ability to impose penalties,
including, importantly, on individuals within companies rather than just the companies
themselves. Against a backdrop of recent corporate scandals, an improved corporate
governance framework has been introduced and is expected to be adopted in legislation soon
(the so-called Tabaksblat code).
D. Financial Sector Assessment
23.
Overall, the financial system is sound, resilient to potential adverse shocks, and
well supervised. The Dutch financial system is dominated by a small number of large
complex financial institutions (LCFIs) which are sectorally integrated—offering, for
example, both banking and insurance services—and internationally oriented. The FSAP
found that the banking sector is well capitalized and diversified, with asset quality and
profitability holding up relatively well in the recent slowdown. Potential risks from high debt
levels and house prices, or from the international environment, appear comfortably within the
capacity of the banks to manage them. Indeed, the authorities noted that the prospect of a
steeper yield curve would tend to favor banks on balance, given the factors mitigating the
effects of higher rates on local borrowers. While insurance companies and especially pension
funds remain exposed to any significant fall of equity prices, they have remained reasonably
liquid and are now in a rebuilding phase, underpinned by firm supervisory action.
24.
The FSAP appraised pending financial supervision legislation and made
recommendations to help preserve long-term financial stability. A significant overhaul of
legislation is underway, with a view to further strengthening the domestic supervisory regime
and formalizing the organizational restructuring of supervision on a sectorally-integrated
basis. The authorities confirmed that the preparatory work is well in hand. Staff welcomed
the planned legislation, which is particularly appropriate given the challenges arising from
the local systemic importance of LCFIs and the substantial international character of their
activities, which places an added premium on supervisory coordination across sectors and
borders. The most important recommendations are summarized in Box 1. The authorities
broadly concurred with the recommendations. They noted that some measures had already
been taken to limit mortgage interest tax deductibility, but that a further phasing out,
notwithstanding potential benefits, would be a challenge politically.

- 16 -

Box 1: FSAP: Summary of Key Recommendations 1/
●
Spelling out clearly the role of the Minister or Ministry of Finance, as applicable, in
those few areas where autonomy is not fully delegated to the supervisor.
●
Ensuring that the Authority for Financial Markets has the power to cooperate with
securities supervisors internationally even when there is no “domestic interest.”
●
Continuing to work with cross-border counterparts to further improve securities
settlement arrangements.
●
Ensuring that the new pensions supervisory arrangements allow sufficient flexibility
in the specified timeframe for making up shortfalls in the coverage ratio, to prevent
procyclical effects, but without allowing unduly prolonged adjustment.
●
Continuing the development of the framework for dealing with crisis situations, both
through further work with other supervisors internationally, and through completing the
review of the domestic deposit guarantee scheme.
●
Continuing the development of macro prudential surveillance to help strengthen the
early identification of risks and vulnerabilities.
●
Over the medium term, phasing out tax deductibility of mortgage interest, preferably
in a gradual fashion to avoid disruptive effects.

Financial System Stability Assessment (FSSA).
E. International Trade and Development Assistance
25.
The Netherlands has a solid track record in supporting multilateral trade
liberalization and meeting the U.N. target for Official Development Assistance (ODA).
The authorities welcomed the increased stature of middle- and low-income countries in
multilateral trade negotiations—noting that improving these countries’ negotiation capacities
has been an area for Dutch technical assistance. Concerning the Doha round, the authorities
still saw a window (albeit small) for concluding negotiations in the current year on the
coattails of the EU’s initiative on agricultural trade liberalization. Moreover, as a large
exporter of high-value agricultural goods, they felt the Netherlands could compete well in a
more liberalized agricultural trading system. Notwithstanding the difficult budgetary situation
as of late and the need to consolidate the public finances, the Netherlands has consistently
exceeded the ODA target of 0.7 percent of GNP.

- 17 -

III. STAFF APPRAISAL
26.
While the Netherlands’ success in the 1980s and 1990s demonstrated the virtues of
strong policies, the sudden and sharp reversal of economic fortunes since the beginning of
the decade is now dominating the economic policy debate. Annual growth has declined
steadily since 2000, while an aging population and decline in productivity growth have raised
concerns about falling potential growth looking ahead. Meanwhile, the public finances
weakened significantly during 2000–03, for structural as well as cyclical reasons. And the
fiscal deficit breached the 3 percent Maastricht ceiling in 2003. The depth of the recent
economic slowdown and deterioration in the fiscal position underscore the need for fiscal
consolidation and structural reform.
27.
The authorities have begun to deal with fundamental issues to ensure a healthy
economy, but more actions are required. Structural reforms to raise both labor participation
and productivity are key to boosting longer-term economic prospects and are in the works.
These reforms will also help to deal with the challenges of population aging, as will the fiscal
adjustment initiated by the authorities. However, stronger and more concrete medium-term
fiscal consolidation plans and structural reform are needed.
28.
The government’s determination to hold the 2004 fiscal deficit to just under
3 percent of GDP is commendable and fits well with economic circumstances. While some
of the structural weaknesses in spending might have been guarded against, the budget has
clearly been hit by shocks that would have been difficult to foresee. Against this background,
the authorities’ determination to offset these structural weaknesses was appropriate. Looking
forward, a recovery is expected but growth is projected to be slow through this year and
downside risks, especially from domestic sources, are a concern. In this context, fiscal policy
strikes the right balance between needed fiscal adjustment on the one hand and the
confidence effects this would engender, and avoiding excessive tightening and associated
disruptions to the recovery on the other. Moreover, based on announced measures, the deficit
target seems achievable. However, risks stem in particular from health care costs and the
budget situation of the local governments. Closer cooperation between the central and local
governments should help keep the deficit of local governments in check. Recent measures to
contain health care costs—through, for example, benchmarking and higher co-payments—are
also welcome, but the suggestion in the coalition agreement to reimpose direct budgetary
controls may still be needed.
29.
Continued fiscal adjustment is essential and the authorities should adopt ambitious
medium-term fiscal targets that ensure fiscal sustainability and deal with the impact of
population aging. The broad outline of the authorities’ strategy of using debt reduction to
save on interest payments to cover the cost of aging is sensible. However, the fiscal slippage
over the last few years, including structural expenditure increases, and the upward revision to
future health care costs since the strategy was articulated, clearly call for more determined
efforts to ensure fiscal adjustment over the medium term. Structural fiscal adjustment of at
least ½ percentage point of GDP per year through the government’s term would take

- 18 -

advantage of the cyclical upturn to prepare for the cost of aging while also being sufficiently
ambitious to bolster confidence. Thus, even with the budget deficit below the 3 percent
ceiling, it is important to be diligent in pursuing continued underlying consolidation of the
public finances. In identifying measures, the authorities are encouraged to consider a gradual
phasing out of mortgage interest deductions and areas that would improve incentives for
work, including the tax-benefits system. Structural reforms to raise labor productivity and
participation would also help to deal with the costs from aging.
30.
The multi-year fiscal framework, anchored on medium-term expenditure ceilings,
is an important instrument for securing fiscal adjustment over time. Thus, recent efforts to
strengthen the framework are commendable. These include the authorities’ decision to devote
revenue windfalls solely to debt reduction, thus avoiding a pro-cyclical bias. Their rule to not
use cyclical expenditure windfalls to fund spending on other items without further
consideration is another move in the right direction, but should, in practice, be strengthened
to preclude new spending. Fiscal consolidation would also be supported by avoiding the past
practice of allowing over performance under one subceiling to raise spending under another.
Thus, the authorities need to follow through with their renewed intention of avoid such
reallocations. While wide-ranging health sector reforms, to be introduced in 2006, carry the
prospect of greater choice and efficiency in meeting the needs of patients, cost control may
continue to be a budgetary issue. Consequently, further budgetary safeguards could be
needed. Finally, enhancing the transparency of the expenditure ceilings would facilitate their
accessibility to a broader audience, adding additional clarity and discipline to the system,
while helping in communicating policy and reinforcing confidence.
31.
Decisive implementation of structural reforms to raise labor participation and
productivity would be mutually reinforcing. This would be the case, in particular, in creating
employment, enhancing economic growth, boosting competitiveness, and achieving fiscal
savings to ensure adequate resources for an aging population. Without significant action in
these areas, the kind of support that society would like to provide to an aging population may
simply not be possible without unduly burdening future generations.
32.
While the authorities have initiated important reforms to raise participation, a
more comprehensive approach would be beneficial. The authorities’ determination to
reform existing disability schemes is welcome in light of the excessive number of
participants, and it is essential to follow through with plans to restrict access to the fully
disabled, use stricter criteria and examinations, strengthen work incentives for the partially
disabled with a view to reintegrating them into the workforce, and rigorously reassess
existing cases on the basis of the new criteria. Plans to remove fiscal incentives for early
retirement are another important step to foster higher labor participation. However, to avoid
shifts from one category of inactivity to another, reforms should be done in a comprehensive
way, to include especially further reducing the generosity of unemployment benefits. Both the
demand for and supply of low-skilled labor would be increased by lowering the minimum
wage and addressing inactivity traps. The latter includes reforming the benefits and tax
system with a view to making work pay. In addition, the recent decentralization of the

- 19 -

provision of welfare benefits highlights the potential gains from setting incentives right and
underscores the importance of how benefits systems are administered. In determining the
retirement age, the authorities are encouraged to take into account changes in life expectancy.
33.
In addition to boosting participation, raising the economy’s potential will require
an acceleration of productivity growth. While the overall level of productivity is
comparatively high, its growth rate has slowed considerably in recent years. It is therefore
encouraging that the government has embraced the challenge of boosting productivity growth
through establishing a high-level “Innovation Platform,” while stepped-up efforts to reduce
the administrative burden, including by revising the content of regulations, are clearly very
helpful in this regard. Nevertheless, more needs to be done to facilitate resource reallocation.
Employment protection is still at a comparatively high level, hindering flexibility and
implicitly taxing new hiring. Greater wage differentiation would, among other things, be
helpful in attracting labor to higher productivity companies and sectors and in opening a
channel to realizing returns from investment in human capital—a relevant complement to the
government’s attempts to raise the importance of private financing of higher education.
34.
While the Netherlands has been at the forefront of product market reform in
Europe, some nontradable sectors have remained protected and their productivity record
has been particularly weak. Against this background, the recent enforcement efforts of the
competition agency are welcome. However, that agency’s effectiveness could be improved
further by broadening and strengthening its powers to investigate and impose penalties.
Regulators should also persevere with efforts to open new avenues for competition in
markets with strong existing incumbents. The introduction of an improved corporate
governance framework is welcome.
35.
While the financial system is sound, resilient to potential adverse shocks, and well
supervised, FSAP recommendations are relevant for pending legislation and preserving
longer-term financial stability. In those few areas where autonomy is not fully delegated to
the supervisors, new legislation should spell out clearly the role of the Minister and the
Ministry of Finance as applicable. Other relevant actions should include ensuring that the
Authority for Financial Markets has the power to cooperate fully with securities supervisors
internationally; continuing to work with cross-border counterparts to improve securities
settlement arrangements; allowing sufficient flexibility for making up shortfalls in the
coverage ratio of pension funds to prevent procyclical effects, but without unduly prolonging
adjustment; continuing to develop the frameworks for crisis management and macroprudential surveillance; and phasing out tax deductibility of mortgage interest over the
medium term, in a gradual fashion to avoid disruptive effects.
36.
The authorities’ support for overseas development assistance and trade
liberalization is commendable. Even in the face of budgetary pressure and consolidation, the
Netherlands still exceeds the United Nations’ target of 0.7 percent of GNP.

- 20 -

37.
While data are adequate for surveillance, it would be helpful to shorten the lag with
which annual fiscal data, consistent with the national accounts, become available, and to start
compiling such fiscal data on a quarterly basis.
38.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with the Netherlands remain
on the 12-month cycle.

APPENDIX II

The Netherlands: Statistical Data Issues
The Netherlands publishes a wide range of economic and financial statistics. Specifically,
annual and quarterly national account data are provided by the Central Bureau of Statistics;
financial and balance of payments data are provided by De Nederlandsche Bank; and fiscal
data are provided by the Ministry of Finance. These data are increasingly available in
electronic form. Macroeconomic data are generally of high quality. Although the overall
government balance is reported monthly, broader fiscal data are not available on a quarterly
basis and national accounts consistent government accounts are only published with lengthy
delays. There are also discrepancies between data compiled by different statistical agencies.
The frequency and timeliness of the availability of the core statistical indicators for Fund
surveillance purposes are summarized in the attached table. The authorities subscribe to the
Special Data Dissemination Standard, providing information about their data and data
dissemination practices on the IMF Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board, with hyperlinks to
national data systems.

APPENDIX III

Aging and the Public Finances in the Netherlands
The Netherlands is in a reasonably good situation to deal with the problem of population
aging. Its population is relatively young (its old-age dependency ratio is among the lowest in
Western Europe and will remain so in the next 50 years, according to the OECD); and its
debt level is below the euro area average (54 percent of GDP in 2003 compared with
70 percent). Importantly, the Netherlands underwent a substantial fiscal consolidation during
the 1990s, which led to a significant improvement in the budget balance and a large reduction
in public debt. According to a study by Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis
(CPB) in 2000, entitled Aging in the Netherlands, the cost of aging and its implications for
long-term fiscal sustainability is manageable.
The existence of the large second pillar helps alleviate, though not eliminate, the burden of
aging on the public finances. The fully funded second pillar accounts for more than 40
percent of pension income, and includes occupational pension schemes, which are mandatory
for workers in the public sector and for more than 90 percent of the workers in the private
sector. Moreover, the taxation of private-sector pension income would provide a substantial
offset to the fiscal cost of aging. The Netherlands (together with the United Kingdom) has by
far the largest amount of private pension fund assets in EU countries. Assets of the Dutch
occupational pension funds amounted to 121 percent of GDP in 2001, and could increase to
nearly 200 percent of GDP by 2040.
To deal with the fiscal cost of aging, the CPB’s study articulated a strategy of swift debt
reduction, which has been supported by Fund staff. According to official estimates, rising
life expectancy and a stable fertility rate are expected to nearly double the old-age
dependency ratio during the next 40 years. Public spending on pensions and health care are
projected to increase by more than 9 percentage points of GDP between 2001 and 2040, when
the projected fiscal cost of aging peaks. However, the taxation of private-sector pension
income could provide a substantial offset to these costs, projected by the CPB to raise
revenue by more than 5 percentage points of GDP between 2000 and 2040. Thus, the fiscal
costs, net of this revenue increase, would rise by about 4 percentage points of GDP by 2040.
These costs, under the strategy, would be covered by the savings on interest payments, thus
avoiding the need for tax hikes.
The methodology used in the study for analyzing the sustainability of the public finances
was based on the generational accounting framework and it aimed to ensure that the
government’s intertemporal budget constraint was satisfied. Thus, in present value terms,
government revenues (T) would be sufficient to cover expenditures (E), including the
liabilities associated with aging. Age-specific benefits from the government minus agespecific tax payments to the government were calculated for the base year and extrapolated to
estimate future revenues and expenditures. If the intertemporal budget constraint were not
satisfied, revenues (expenditures) would need to rise (fall), with the permanent adjustment
required to close the gap equal to (r – g) (E – T)/GDP, with r = the interest rate and g = the
growth rate of GDP. A key idea is to hold tax rates constant over time in order to minimize

deadweight loss. The argument, laid out in Barro (1979),13 is that the distortionary cost of a
tax rises more than proportionally with the tax rate, implying that the total distortion is
minimized when the tax rate is constant.14
The authorities in 2000 set a fiscal target consistent with this strategy. In particular, the
overall budget balance would reach a surplus of 1¼ to 1¾ percent of GDP in 2007 and public
debt would be eliminated by 2025. The underlying macroeconomic assumptions were that the
real interest rate (4 percent), the inflation rate (2 percent), and average labor productivity
growth (1¾ percent) are exogenous and constant; potential GDP growth declines gradually to
about 1.5 percent by 2030 as the labor supply falls, but rises to 1.8 percent by 2050.
However, recent developments suggest the need for revisions. Projections of future health
care costs have been revised upward. Moreover, with the rapid fiscal deterioration since
2000, achieving the above objective would now require an unrealistic reduction of public
expenditure in the next three years on the order of 4 percentage points of GDP.
If recent expenditure trends were to continue through 2007 (with real spending growing by
2½ percent a year), the budget deficit would expand in the next few years and have a
significantly negative impact on debt dynamics. Based on staff estimates, the stock of public
debt by 2025 could be close to 50 percent of GDP (Panel A), and longer-term debt dynamics
would raise concerns. This would necessitate, to restore fiscal balance, tax increases which
could impair economic performance at a time when labor force reductions from aging would
reduce the potential growth of the economy, or other cuts in spending. Furthermore, the
experience of the last few years suggests that the assumptions on labor productivity growth
may be optimistic, underscoring the need for decisive structural reforms.
The CPB has undertaken a partial update of the 2000 study. Taking into account revised
projections for health care expenditures and a new target for the fiscal balance (a primary
surplus of 0.4 percent of GDP in 2007), a new sustainable debt path was estimated.
Consistent with the notion of tax smoothing, this was accompanied by assuming a permanent
increase in taxes of 1.8 percent of GDP in 2008 (Panel B). Under this scenario, after
declining through 2030, the debt would start to rise (albeit modestly), with the fiscal deficit
reappearing and its size reaching about 1.0 percent of GDP by 2050.
Staff prepared an alternative scenario, also consistent with fiscal sustainability. In this
scenario, the goal was to ensure fiscal balance around zero in the long run, which would also
be consistent with the general principles of the stability and growth pact. The scenario also

This rule is not equivalent to equalizing the tax burden across generations.

considers another policy option—namely no further increase in taxes in light of the potential
costs due, for instance, to the increasing international mobility of the tax base or intensifying
international tax competition. To meet these objectives, the scenario envisages structural
adjustment of 0.5 percentage point of GDP per year during the current government term
through expenditure restraint (Panel C). This would imply reaching a primary general
government surplus of about 1½ percent of GDP in 2007, with the underlying structural
position near balance; with a zero fiscal balance, the ratio of debt to GDP would fall. Of
course, efforts to reduce distortions in the labor market that boosted potential growth and
productivity by more than the baseline would alleviate some the aging problem and, in this
sense, the urgency of fiscal adjustment.

On GDP:

•

According to Statistics Netherlands, real GDP growth on a year-average basis was
revised for 2001–03 as shown in the table below. Average growth during these years
was therefore slightly stronger than previously thought: 0.4 percent, up from
0.2 percent.

Regarding the current year, the second quarter GDP figures were, on balance, in line
with staff’s overall forecast of about 1 percent real growth in 2004. The preliminary
data for that quarter indicated that real GDP fell by 0.2 percent quarter-on-quarter
(seasonally and working-day adjusted), but grew by 1.1 percent year-on-year.
Investment dropped and was weaker than expected, but the contribution of the foreign
balance was stronger than expected.

3.
In the area of fiscal policy, a new package of multi-year fiscal adjustment measures
was announced, amounting to a cumulative €750 million by 2007 (equivalent to 0.2 percent
of estimated 2004 GDP). The measures, which are aimed at making some further progress
toward narrowing the fiscal deficit over the medium term, are mainly in the areas of
infrastructure, education, and health care. While a step in the right direction, the package,
given its modest size, does not go far enough in terms of meeting staff’s call for stepping-up
the medium term fiscal consolidation effort.
4.
In other developments, recent indicators are consistent with the slow recovery
forecasted for this year. While both consumer and producer confidence have recovered from
their lows of the summer of 2003, these indicators have failed to show significant further
improvement in recent months. Year-on-year HICP inflation fell to 1.2 percent in July,
despite higher oil prices.

IMF Concludes 2004 Article IV Consultation with the Kingdom of
the Netherlands—Netherlands
On September 8, 2004, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV Consultation with the Kingdom of the Netherlands—
Netherlands.1
Background
The Dutch economy is starting to recover from a period of weak performance. Following
several years of rapid expansion, GDP growth averaged only 0.2 percent during
2001-03, and turned negative in the latter year for the first time in twenty years.
However, growth has strengthened in recent quarters, and staff expects the economy to
grow by 1.1 percent in 2004 and by 1.8 percent in 2005. Improving exports are the main
driver; domestic demand is expected to take longer to recover. Meanwhile, given soft
labor market conditions and economic slack generally, price and wage pressures are
likely to remain subdued for the period ahead.
In the context of the nascent recovery, downside risks to the outlook for growth are a
concern with those stemming from domestic sources especially pronounced. Near-term
growth is unlikely to make a significant dent in still rising unemployment, so even
relatively minor changes to the wage and employment outlook could prompt a
reassessment of income and therefore consumption plans. High household debt
accentuates income risks, including those associated with higher interest rates.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions
with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and
financial information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments
and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the
basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the
Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive
Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities.

-2-

The fiscal balance deteriorated markedly. Between 2000 and 2003, the general
government balance worsened by almost 5 ½ percentage points of GDP, resulting in a
breach of the 3 percent Maastricht ceiling in 2003. While part of the deterioration
reflected the working of automatic stabilizers, another part—amounting to roughly
2 percentage points of GDP—was structural. The policy measures announced by the
authorities should bring the deficit down to just under 3 percent of GDP in 2004. Risks—
which, to avoid another breach, would need to be addressed if they were to
materialize—stem in particular from health care costs and the budget situation of the
local governments.
On the structural front, the authorities have plans for a number of key reforms in the
period ahead. The disability scheme is to be reformed by restricting access only to those
fully disabled, while introducing stricter criteria and examinations, and strengthening
work incentives for the partially disabled. Also, fiscal incentives for early retirement are
to be fully removed, while participation in collective early retirement plans is to be made
voluntary. In the area of unemployment insurance, follow-up benefits (which had added
2 ½ years to the maximum of 5 years of main benefits available) have already been
phased out. The authorities plan to eliminate short-term benefits as well, and tighten the
eligibility requirements for the main unemployment benefits. To reduce inactivity traps,
the earned-income tax credit is being gradually increased. The Netherlands has
generally been at the forefront of product market reform in Europe, although some
sectors (e.g., construction and nontraded services) have remained sheltered.
Over the past year, the Netherlands took part in an IMF Financial Sector Assessment
Program (FSAP). During this period, the authorities were in the process of concluding a
substantial overhaul of the institutional setup for financial stability policy by moving to a
new cross-sectional structure of supervision by objective (prudential and conduct of
business) and revising the laws that underpin financial supervision.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that the Dutch economy is emerging from an extended
downturn, with continued low inflationary pressures contributing to increased external
competitiveness. Directors expressed concern, however, over the depth of the
downturn, the significant weakening of the public finances in recent years, and the
prospect of falling potential growth if slowing productivity growth were to continue at a
time when the population is aging. Directors therefore commended the authorities for
their efforts to restore fiscal balance and to strengthen the foundations for a broadbased growth. They emphasized the need to sustain such efforts, especially those
geared to raising potential output growth through reforms to labor and product markets.
In light of the Netherlands’ earlier record of sound fiscal and structural policies, which
underpinned economic success, Directors were confident that the authorities would
continue to pursue appropriate policies in these areas. While expressing concern about
some of the recent structural increases in spending, they concurred that fiscal policy
seems to be on the right path and praised the government’s determination to hold the
deficit in 2004 to below 3 percent of GDP.

-3-

Directors observed that, while a recovery is in train, growth is expected to be slow this
year, and downside risks, from both domestic and external sources, are a concern.
In particular, Directors were concerned about the rapid increases in house prices and
household debt, and their potential impact on income and consumption. Against these
downside risks, they viewed fiscal policy in 2004 as appropriately balanced between
needed fiscal adjustment in structural terms and avoiding excessive tightening.
However, in view of possible fiscal slippage, Directors supported measures to limit
public spending through closer cooperation between the central and local governments
and, if necessary, direct budgetary controls on health care spending.
Directors pointed to the benefits of an ambitious medium-term fiscal adjustment,
recommending a structural improvement of at least half a percentage point of GDP per
year through the government’s term. They considered that such an adjustment would
put fiscal policy on an appropriate path toward ensuring fiscal sustainability and dealing
with the impact of population aging, while also bolstering confidence. Directors were in
broad agreement with the authorities’ emphasis on debt reduction to save on interest
payments to cover aging costs, but stressed that stronger and more concrete mediumterm fiscal consolidation plans are needed. In identifying measures, they encouraged
the authorities to improve incentives for work, including measures in the tax-benefits
system. Some Directors favored a gradual phasing out of mortgage interest deductions,
though these Directors and others stressed the need to consider carefully the impact of
this measure on the housing market and the financial system.
Directors commended the broad features of the fiscal framework, particularly the
emphasis on medium-term expenditure ceilings, but noted the importance of
strengthening certain aspects. In this context, they welcomed the decision to devote
revenue windfalls solely to debt reduction, thus avoiding a procyclical bias. Directors
also urged the authorities to eschew spending cyclical expenditure savings. In addition,
they stressed that enhancing the transparency of the expenditure ceilings and the ability
to monitor them would strengthen clarity and discipline in the system.
Directors were encouraged by the authorities’ efforts to reform the labor market.
They welcomed important reforms to raise labor force participation and work effort,
including the envisaged abolition of fiscal incentives for early retirement and the plan for
a major overhaul of the disability scheme, supported by tight enforcement of any stricter
disability criteria. However, while acknowledging the difficulties in building consensus for
reform, Directors cautioned that reforms should also include the unemployment
insurance scheme, to avoid having workers shift from one category of inactivity to
another. Directors also urged the authorities to address inactivity traps, including by
adjusting the minimum wage, which would also enhance the demand for low-skilled
labor. To further raise participation, Directors stressed the importance of taking into
account changes in life expectancy in determining the retirement age.
Directors were encouraged by efforts to raise productivity growth, noting that while
overall productivity is high, its growth has slowed considerably in recent years.
They therefore welcomed the establishment of the high-level Innovation Platform, the

-4-

efforts under way to significantly reduce administrative burdens and improve corporate
governance, and the work of the competition agency. Nevertheless, with a view to
facilitating more efficient resource allocation, Directors felt that overly stringent
employment protection hindered flexibility and implicitly taxed new hiring. In addition,
Directors noted that greater wage differentiation would be helpful in attracting labor to
higher productivity companies and sectors and in opening a channel to realize returns
from investment in human capital. Directors also urged regulators to persevere with
efforts to open new avenues for competition.
Directors welcomed the analysis of the FSAP and agreed with its conclusion that the
financial system is sound, resilient to potential shocks, and well supervised.
They commended the pending new financial supervision legislation, which will further
strengthen the supervision system and account for the cross-sectoral nature of financial
institutions. To prevent procyclical effects, Directors also felt that the authorities needed
to allow sufficient flexibility for making up shortfalls in pension fund coverage ratios
without unduly prolonging adjustment. More generally, they encouraged the authorities
to continue with their commendable efforts to strengthen securities settlement
arrangements and the financial stability policy framework. Directors welcomed the
implementation of strong AML/CFT measures.
Directors applauded Dutch support of trade liberalization and strongly praised the
generosity of their overseas development assistance, even in the face of budgetary
pressures.
