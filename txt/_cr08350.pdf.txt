The 2008 Article IV Consultation discussions were held in Vientiane during
April 30−May 13 with Minister of Finance Duangdy, Bank of Lao P.D.R. Governor
Khamphounvong, other senior officials, and private sector and donor representatives. The staff
team comprised Mr. Cowen (Head), Ms. Mineshima, Mr. Wu (all APD), Mr. Shin (FAD), and
Ms. Ogawa (OAP), and was assisted by Mr. Bingham (Senior Resident Representative) and
Mr. Ngaosrivathana (Country Manager). Mr. Ludlow (FAD), as part of a World Bank-led
mission on customs administration, also participated in several meetings. Ms. Vincelette and
Mr. Painchaud (both World Bank) worked with the team on the debt sustainability analysis.
Ms. Sucharitakul, Alternate Executive Director, and Mr. Eng, Advisor to the Executive
Director, participated in the discussions.

•

Prior consultations: The conduct of fiscal policy has been mostly in line with recent IMF
advice, although the composition of spending should be more supportive of growth and
poverty reduction. Monetary policy, including prior recommendations to develop basic
instruments for managing domestic liquidity, has been less effective, but exchange rate
management generally reflects recent advice. The pursuit of banking reform has been mostly
consistent with earlier recommendations, notwithstanding rapid expansion in bank credit
recently, which could undermine progress.

•

Exchange rate system: Lao P.D.R.’s exchange rate regime is classified as a managed float.
Currently, it maintains no exchange restrictions under the transitional arrangements of
Article XIV, Section 2, but does maintain restrictions for the preservation of national or
international security notified pursuant to Decision No. 144-(52/51) and a restriction subject to
IMF approval under Article VIII (tax payment certificates are required for some transactions).
Staff advised the authorities to eliminate the latter restriction before accepting the obligations
under Article VIII.

•

Economic statistics: Further improvements are needed in the quality, coverage, and timeliness
of macroeconomic and financial data to enhance the effectiveness of surveillance.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Macroeconomic performance remains strong, but possible overheating could dampen
near-term prospects unless properly managed. So far, global economic weakness and
financial turbulence have had little direct impact on Lao P.D.R. Real GDP growth was nearly
8 percent in 2007, and is expected to be near the same in 2008 on favorable mining and
hydropower activity. However, headline inflation began accelerating in mid-2007, initially
reflecting global energy and food price trends, but now also local demand pressures. Fueling
demand is rapidly accelerating credit growth, with monetary conditions lax owing to large
external inflows associated with the natural resource sector.
The medium-term outlook remains positive, but hinges on sound development of the
resource sector and other steps to strengthen competitiveness. The resource sector is
expected to continue as a major driver of growth, but it poses potential fiscal risks and
remains vulnerable to external shocks. More balanced and sustained high growth will require
accelerated structural reforms, strengthened human capital, and sound infrastructure
development, supported by enhanced capacity in macroeconomic and resource management.
Policy discussions focused on near-term challenges to maintaining macroeconomic
stability, as well as on a few key structural issues. The main staff recommendations, with
which the authorities generally agreed, are:
•

More decisive action is needed on the inflation front to preserve hard-fought
stability gains. Monetary tightening is warranted, supported by further exchange rate
appreciation. However, available tools may be inadequate and transmission channels
weak, requiring monetary policy be backed by tighter prudential regulation and
enhanced bank supervision. The authorities recognized these challenges, but viewed
recent credit growth as less a factor in possible overheating. Nonetheless, they agreed
close monitoring was needed of state-owned commercial banks, given rapid growth
in their lending and with these banks’ restructuring still at an early stage.

•

A low fiscal deficit is necessary given a still high level of public external debt and to
help contain aggregate demand. Resource revenues have been a major contributor to
recent consolidation, but given their uncertainty, maintaining a sound fiscal stance
necessitates steady progress on recentralizing fiscal authority, enhancing budget controls,
and broadening the tax base—including through a well-executed value added tax.

•

Sound development and management of the resource sector requires a
comprehensive strategy to help contain macro-financial risks. An immediate
priority should be to ensure a framework is in place to properly manage external
inflows, expected budget windfalls, and new debt obligations arising from sector
development, including close scrutiny of those needed to finance the government’s
own equity participation.

I. MACROECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
1.
The Lao economy has performed well in recent years, reflecting generally
stable macroeconomic conditions and a rapidly expanding natural resource sector.
The fiscal position has further improved, on rising resource and more recently
nonresource revenues. Despite a sharp widening in the external current account deficit,
the overall external position has strengthened, given large inflows associated with
resource sector development. However, these inflows are also increasingly driving
monetary and exchange rate developments, presenting new challenges for policy makers.

Overall, the economy continued to expand at an elevated pace in 2007, with

reaching 21 percent (y/y). Demand for kip loans was especially strong owing to local
construction activity and government’s effort to encourage kip use. Kip deposits also
grew rapidly, driven by further currency substitution and a widening kip–dollar interest
rate differential.
4.
The fiscal outturn in 2006/07 was generally positive, notwithstanding some
expenditure slippages. Based on staff estimates, the overall budget deficit declined by
around 1 percentage point to 2¾ percent of GDP in 2006/07 owing largely to higher
resource revenue (Table 4 and Figure 2). A modest reduction was also achieved in the
underlying (nonresource) deficit, even though spending slightly exceeded the budget
target.2 The deficit continued to be financed through external concessional borrowing.
For 2007/08, the final budget plan targeted an overall deficit equivalent to 3¾ percent of
GDP—about the same as the previous year’s budget plan. Resource revenue would
continue rising, but recurrent expenditure would also increase, largely due to a higher
government wage bill.3 However, capital expenditure would be lower than in recent
years, in part because of the near-completion of the Nam Theun 2 project, but also given a
more cautious approach by donors in line with government capacity.

Credit growth reached 48 percent

government pressure to lend to small- to medium-scale enterprises, including agriculture.
Wage pressures may also be rising, given the recent pace of economic expansion and
greater demand for skilled workers. The kip has been allowed to further strengthen
against the U.S. dollar and more recently the Thai baht, given large inflows and to offset
inflation pressures.

Greater exchange rate flexibility in

Domestic agricultural conditions have been
conducive to relatively low food price
inflation. Agricultural output expanded by
2.9 percent in 2007 (and rice production by
3.9 percent)—up from 2.1 percent the
previous year. Rice production is also
primarily glutinous rice, which has a
limited export market (rice exports were
US$14 million in 2006/07 (October–
September)—only around 3 percent of the
annual crop). The government encourages
producers to sell in local markets, although
no export duties or controls exist on rice.
Food imports also tend to be low, reflecting
the government’s policy of food selfsufficiency. The recent rise in food prices
appears more likely driven by higher input
costs, including fertilizer and transport.

Several factors may explain lower inflation in
Lao P.D.R. than other parts of the region.

Regional Inflation Indicators

Jan-04

Inflation has been rising in Lao P.D.R. since
mid-2007, but the headline rate remains
considerably lower than in neighboring
Cambodia and Vietnam. As elsewhere, food
and energy price increases are a leading cause
in Lao P.DR. However, food prices have risen
less and been a smaller contributor to overall
inflation than in other parts of the region. Retail
petroleum prices in Lao P.D.R. have generally
increased in line with world oil price
movements, with diesel and gasoline up 51 and
25 percent (y/y), respectively, as of end-May.

7
II. OUTLOOK AND RISKS
6.
Growth is projected by staff at 7½ percent in 2008, but downside risks have
emerged with the recent acceleration in inflation. 4 Driving growth are similar factors as
last year, as well as higher mining output. However, measures may be needed to reduce
overheating, mainly by curbing credit growth. Staff still expect inflation will stay in the low
double digits this year—but well above the government’s target of 6 percent, with recent
global trends pointing to further upside pressure. Notwithstanding high mineral prices, the
external current account deficit is expected to widen to around 18 percent of GDP in 2008
on continued large oil and capital imports. However, the overall external position should
improve on strong inflows, in particular those for hydropower development.
7.
The medium-term outlook for Lao P.D.R. remains favorable, but rests on
sound development of the resource sector and steps elsewhere to strengthen
competitiveness. Staff’s growth projections are in line with the government’s target at
7.5–8.0 percent per year (Table 5), led by resource activity (Box 2). Underlying
(nonresource) growth is also expected rise to 6 percent over the medium term, but this
requires a more dynamic financial sector, better investment climate, and further trade
integration in the region and beyond, as well as human capital and infrastructure
development. The current account deficit should begin to decline significantly starting in
2012, assuming resource project-related imports moderate, world oil prices stabilize, and
new hydropower projects come on stream as planned, including the large Nam Theun 2
project from end-2009. Under this scenario, external vulnerability is reduced, with the
reserve cover reaching nearly six months of nonresource imports over the medium term.
Despite this positive outlook, substantial risks remain going forward. The
most immediate threat would be a further rise in oil and food prices. A higher oil import
bill could also offset rising mining export receipts. Over the medium term, large inflows
could result in “Dutch disease” absent reforms noted above needed to ensure more
balanced and sustained growth. On the other hand, a persistence in tight global credit
conditions could raise borrowing costs and cause start-up delays in resource sector
projects, with negative fiscal and growth consequences. Demand for raw materials,
fueled by emerging markets, could also come down sharply if global prospects further
soared.

The official projection for is 7.9 percent, with the authorities expecting a greater contribution from services.

Box 2. Resource Sector: Medium-Term Outlook
Under the current baseline, hydropower is
expected expand rapidly, with installed generation
capacity projected to increase nine-fold by 2014,
provided current plans are fully implemented.
Investment in this sector alone could reach
US$5.2 billion over the next five years (averaging
the equivalent of around 14 percent of GDP a year).

Resource revenue is expected to level off at

This projection may appear conservative based on
recent trends and does not account the spillover
effects to other activities. In addition, it could
change significantly depending on the extent of the
government’s equity stake in resource projects
above current expected levels. Resource revenues
also remain subject to volatile commodity prices
and an uncertain external environment.

III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
9.
Policy discussions focused on three key issues: (i) improving monetary
management, including as a complement to banking reform; (ii) pursuing a sound fiscal
stance, supported by strengthened public financial and resource revenue management;
and (iii) managing resource-related investment effectively.
A. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy and Near-Term Stability
10.
Under current conditions, staff indicated more decisive action was needed to
contain excess liquidity arising from external inflows. Monetary tightening was
advised, including allowing for further exchange rate appreciation. In particular, stricter
control was recommended over growth in net domestic assets (NDA) of the BoL. This
would likely need to come through higher reserve requirements (kip and foreign currency),
given the lack of available instruments.5 Open market operations could also be employed,
possibly through the issuance of monetary stabilization bonds, as the BoL is now better
able to bear the financial costs associated with indirect instruments. To increase policy
effectiveness, staff again emphasized the need to develop an interbank money market. As a
first step, a more efficient payments and settlement system is required, so that banks can
avoid holding excess reserves at the BoL and manage their liquid balances more
effectively, including through interbank activity.
11.
The authorities recognized the challenges posed by current conditions, but
were reluctant to tighten monetary policy to stem the recent credit growth. At the
same time, the BoL would consider ways over time to improve capacity in monetary
control, including foreign reserves management, and continue pursuing a flexible
exchange rate policy. The authorities noted that bank credit in Lao P.D.R. was small by
most measures (8 percent of GDP at end-2007) and needed to increase rapidly to sustain
growth. Staff indicated these factors should be weighed against the risk of undermining
macroeconomic and financial stability.
12.
In line with greater exchange rate flexibility, more efforts are needed to
deepen the foreign exchange market. Formal intervention by the BoL appears limited
mostly to smoothing short-term volatility and so as to keep the official market rate
(i.e., the exchange rate band around the BoL’s daily reference rate) in line with the

5

Staff also noted an earlier recommendation to develop a standing deposits facility (i.e., through remunerated
excess reserves).

10
parallel market rate.6 However, the lack of trading in the interbank markets requires the
BoL to step in on occasion to help banks manage their foreign liquidity needs. Staff noted
that greater interbank trading could be facilitated by better information sharing between
banks, including through more automated transactions. Related to this, consideration
should be given to widening the daily trading band.
B. Fiscal Policy and Resource Management
13.
Initial indicators point to further fiscal consolidation in 2007/08 on continued
revenue gains. The overall budget deficit is projected to fall to 1.7 percent of GDP—
significantly outperforming the official target. Revenue is expected to be boosted by still
buoyant mining taxes and royalties and improved tax administration. However, overall
performance will be tempered by fiscal measures taken to mitigate the impact of high
energy price. Starting in May 2008, caps were placed on the dutiable price of petroleum
imports, effectively providing tax relief on gasoline, diesel, and kerosene in the event of
further price rises.7 The authorities generally agreed that any further measures, including
on food, would be well targeted and minimally distorting, with a limited impact on the
overall fiscal position, including in next year’s budget.
14.
Based on preliminary budget preparations, the government is expected to
continue pursuing a moderately low fiscal deficit in 2008/09. Staff supported this
move, given the size of public debt and to help contain aggregate demand pressures.
However, it needs to be complemented by further efforts to broaden the tax base,
improve revenue administration, and strengthen expenditure management, in line with
the government’s public finance management strengthening program (PFMSP). Despite
long delays, staff also urged caution in proceeding with a value-added tax (VAT) planned
for January 2009 and recommended postponement, if necessary, given work to be done
on taxpayer registration, refunds, and education. To meet the targeted date, the authorities
noted a limited rollout might be considered by raising the compulsory VAT threshold,
but staff noted this could present further administrative challenges by restricting the

Currently, commercial banks must limit the bid-ask spread on their daily foreign exchange transactions to
±0.25 percent of the BoL’s daily reference rate (reduced from ±0.30 in August 2007). The BoL typically uses
this daily trading band as well as regional currency trends to set the next day’s reference rate, although on
occasion the reference rate is set outside the band to account for broader (i.e., parallel) market conditions.
Spreads between official and parallel market rates fluctuate, but generally remain less than 1 percent.

7

At the time, staff estimated the cost of this measure was about 0.3 percent of GDP in foregone revenue in
2007/08. However, given most petroleum taxes are collected on an ad valorem basis, total collections for the
year should more than exceed the budget target owing to much higher-than-anticipated petroleum import prices.

11
number of taxpayers.8 On expenditure, staff recommended caution on any further large
wage bill increases, including to avoid crowding out critical spending on operations and
maintenance and in key social sectors. Plans to expand the civil service would also be
weighed carefully against the existing budget envelope.9 The authorities also concurred
with staff on the need to show spending and financing for the 2009 SEA Games
transparently.
15.
Discussion also focused on progress made in strengthening budget execution
and performance. Under the PFMSP, focus remains on recentralizing fiscal authority and
improving overall accountability in line with the revised Budget Law (2006), with support
from the World Bank’s Poverty Reduction Support Operations (PRSO) and other donors.
•

On recentralizing tax and customs administration, government instructions have
been issued guiding the process, with initial pilots establishing central authority
through regional customs offices and provincial tax offices now under way in
several larger provinces. More resources are also being devoted to developing and
staffing a large taxpayers unit.

•

To strengthen inter-governmental fiscal relations, an implementation decree was
issued in early 2008 guiding the framework on revenue and expenditure
assignment. However, considerable work remains in setting budget norms to
ensure adequate spending in priority areas with shared revenues.

•

New budget nomenclature has been approved consistent with GSFM 2001, and a
revised chart of accounts is expected to be introduced for fiscal year 2008/09.
Regulations are also being devised for introducing a Treasury Single Account
framework over the next few years to strengthen cash management and control.

16.
The staff encouraged the government to develop a comprehensive strategy
for resource management. The need was reiterated for a medium-term fiscal framework
that accounts for potential volatility in resource revenues and ensures expenditure
priorities are properly funded. Underpinning this would be a transparent fiscal regime,

The VAT replaces the turnover tax for large taxpayers and introduces a standard 10 percent rate. Under current
plans, compulsory registration will be required for those enterprises with annual turnover of more than kip
400 million (US$45,000)—around 1,800. Based on staff’s estimate, postponement of the VAT in 2008/09
would result in lower revenue by 0.2 percent of GDP.

9

The government indicated it plans to increase the number of civil servants between now and 2010 by around
4–5 percent a year, mainly to hire new education and health workers, but also to establish a new agency to cover
water and environment issues.

12
which a revised Mining Law is expected to contain for that sector when finalized later
this year. With a State Accumulation Fund (SAF) for resource revenues now operating,
staff also urged the accounting for and use of the SAF remain on-budget, consistent with
the IMF’s Guide on Resource Revenue Transparency. Staff also noted that any strategy
should lay out the conditions for government equity ownership in the resource sector, to
ensure they are consistent with maximizing revenue and limiting risk exposure. Closer
monitoring was also urged of new debt-creating obligations for public entities in the
hydropower sector, including on-lent funds to and direct loan guarantees for Lao Holding
State Enterprise and Electricité du Laos (EDL).

The authorities agreed with the staff assessment that the value of the kip is
broadly in line with fundamentals. CGER-type estimates indicate scope for a further
modest appreciation, although these results should be interpreted cautiously.10
Recognizing this, more should be done to strengthen external competitiveness. A major
component of the World Bank’s current PRSO is aimed at improving the investment
climate and lowering business costs, including streamlining licensing for business startups and harmonizing the investment regime for domestic and foreign investors—all
consistent with the Enterprise Law

Based on total trade and nonresource balances for the period 1991−2007, the estimated results suggest the real
effective exchange rate (REER) is undervalued by 7½ percent and 1 percent, respectively, relative to the mediumterm level of its fundamental determinants. However, their robustness may be limited given major structural
changes to the Lao economy, weak and incomplete macroeconomic data, and a limited number of observations.

require timely interventions by the government through forthcoming working party
meetings and additional work on amending regulations to be WTO compliant.
18.
The debt sustainability analysis for Lao P.D.R. continues to show the debt
stock well above policy-based indicative thresholds, suggesting a high risk of debt
distress. Nonetheless, debt indictors have become more favorable in recent years,
supported by strong economic growth, a more stable macroeconomic environment, and
favorable external conditions. The total stock of external public and publicly-guaranteed
debt was US$2.4 billion at end-2007, or 60 percent of GDP. Debt sustainability continues
to depend on sustained high growth, as well as on improved external competitiveness and
largely concessional borrowing. Strong control over quasi-fiscal risks arising from the
state sector will also be necessary, including borrowing and guarantees for resource
sector projects, as noted above.
D. Banking Sector and State Enterprise Reforms
19.
Banking reform should continue to be pursued vigorously, given the
financial recovery of SOCBs is still at an early stage. Nonperforming loans (NPLs)
have been reduced noticeably at the larger SOCBs, but weak capital positions still leave
these banks vulnerable (Box 3). Interest rate spreads also remain large, suggesting the
need for improved operating efficiency and greater competition. To bring the banks up to
the minimum stipulated capital-adequacy ratio of 8 percent in the next few years, staff
encouraged the authorities to continue carefully recapitalizing the SOCBs, improving
their profitability, and seeking possible strategic investors. The SOCBs viewed rapid
credit expansion as key to increased profitability. However, staff cautioned that given the
current pace and with risk controls not yet fully tested, these banks continued to warrant
close monitoring to avoid new NPLs. Efforts are also needed to develop a credit
information system and strengthen the payment culture. As a complementary move, staff
urged stricter enforcement of the existing prudential and regulatory framework, including
through more off-site monitoring. In support, the authorities indicated plans to issue soon
a full set of implementation regulations for the commercial bank law. Staff also noted
that better disclosure of banks’ financial condition, including through development of
financial soundness indicators, was essential to safeguarding the banking system.12
20.
Further progress has been made on state-owned enterprise reform. Under the
World Bank’s first series of PRSO, the larger SOEs began undergoing external audits in

12

The BoL will require banks to publish annual reports starting in 2009.

14

Box 3. Banking Sector Reform
Lao P.D.R. has pursued a reform program since 2003 aimed at strengthening banking oversight and
restructuring the state-owned commercial bank (SOCB) sector. It also seeks to level the playing field for
private and foreign banks and encourage their entry, given the small size of the banking system and dominance
by the SOCBs (which accounted for 63 percent of total system assets at end-2002, compared to 54 percent as of
April 2008). Reforms were necessitated by a sharp deterioration in the quality of SOCBs’ balance sheets as a
result of poor risk management and large directed lending (particular to state-owned enterprises). Conditions
were exacerbated by weak monetary discipline and lapse bank supervision.
Following initial delays, some progress has been
made, with donor technical and financial support
mainly from the Asian Development Bank (AsDB),
as well as the World Bank.

•

•

•

The Law on Commercial Banks approved in
2006 aimed at strengthening bank governance,
with prudential regulations in line with Basel
Core Principles. The law also allows majority
foreign ownership of banks.
Non-performing loans (NPLs) have declined
significantly at the SOCBs. Progress has been
achieved through loan work-outs and write-offs,
but some NPLs are off-balance sheet awaiting
final resolution. Banks have increased loan-loss
provisioning, but their loan-to-deposit ratios has
also fallen sharply, limiting profits.
Improvements in SOCBs’ capital positions
have lagged. By official estimates, each SOCB
remains insolvent but this, too, is changing. Since
June 2006, the government has issued kip
350 billion of a planned kip 600 billion in
recapitalization bonds. The rest is expected by
late 2008, which should further strengthen
SOCBs’ capital base.

•

Oversight of all banks has also been
strengthened. The BoL has increased its on-site supervision and off-site monitoring, although capacity
remains weak. Branch lending caps and lending limits on related parties and single borrowers have been
imposed, but the recent increase in the latter limit from 10 to 25 percent of Tier 1 capital merits close watch by
the BoL. The two large SOCBs now undergo external audits consistent with governance agreements between
them and the BoL. However, the BoL continues as both SOCB regulator and owner, which creates potential
conflicts.

•

A small policy bank was created in early 2007 as a spin-off from an SOCB. However, the government
continues to pressure SOCBs to lend to certain sectors, which could compromise their financial recovery.

The government has indicated interest in attracting strategic investors for SOCBs, including foreign
banks. Consideration is also being given to transforming the two large SOCBs into publicly-held companies at
the targeted launch of a stock market in 2010. Competition from private and foreign banks is also increasing.
Since 2003, 4 new deposit-taking institutions (2 local and 2 foreign banks) have been licensed, bringing the total
to 15, with 3 more foreign bank expected this year. Nonbank activity remains limited, although three insurance
companies were licensed over the last year and a private leasing company is being formed.

15
early 2008. EDL’s financial performance has also improved through further clearance of
government arrears (with plans now in place to settle those through fiscal year 2005/06)
and more frequent adjustments in electricity tariffs. In furtherance of the
commercialization of SOEs, staff supported efforts to create an operational body to
monitor their financial performance, including debt management, as well as to transform
or liquidate non-strategic or loss-making enterprises.
E. Other Issues
21.
A government decree is being prepared authorizing the removal of exchange
restriction on tax payment certificates, as a possible precursor to accepting the
obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement.
No firm timetable was given, but the authorities noted the decision to remove the
restriction was in conjunction with plans to ratify the World Customs Organization’s
revised Kyoto Convention on simplifying and harmonizing customs procedures.
22.
On macroeconomic and financial data, shortcomings remain that hamper
surveillance. Priority should be placed on strengthening balance of payments (BOP)
statistics and national income accounts, as well as external public debt (including
guarantees) and subnational fiscal accounts. Better measurement of BOP-related activity,
in particular, would enhance policy formulation in managing inflows and containing
vulnerabilities. Automation of customs procedures is expected to improve trade statistics
over the next few years, but more coordination among statistical agencies, greater use of
banking data, and a direct survey of foreign-invested activity are also needed.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
23.
The Lao economy has entered a critical stage of development, as it opens to
large-scale inflows and creates conditions for sustaining high growth. A combination
of favorable commodity price trends and growing electricity demand in the region are
expected to help sustain growth and strengthen external position over the medium term.
While much more remains to be done to improve competitiveness, the government’s
reform agenda appears supportive of these objectives. Maintenance of a stable
macroeconomic environment will also be important to lowering business costs and
attracting foreign investment, including outside the resource sector.
24.
The economy remains resilient to global economic slowdown and financial
turbulence, but inflation pressures present a growing challenge to the authorities.
More decisive action is needed to counter these pressures, given their current sources and
potential costs, in particular to the large number of impoverished households in
Lao P.D.R. Exchange rate appreciation has helped mitigate some of the impact, and a
further strengthening of the kip could ease pressures. However, rapid expansion of credit
growth is fueling demand pressures, which risks reversing recent stability gains.

16
25.
Under these circumstances, monetary tightening is warranted, but the
effectiveness of the BoL will depend on how quickly it moves to improve its capacity
for managing domestic liquidity. Over the near term, consideration should be given to
using available indirect instruments as recommended in this staff report and earlier ones.
Absent effective monetary operations, tighter prudential regulations may be necessary to
contain credit growth, in particular by still-fragile SOCBs. The government should also
resist pressuring these banks to lend to certain sectors. Staff views the move to greater
exchange rate flexibility as appropriate, in facilitating a tightening of monetary policy
and enhancing the economy’s resiliency to external shocks. Given the REER appears
somewhat undervalued, a more flexible exchange rate should also allow quicker
adjustment to the equilibrium level and reduce spreads between official and parallel rates.
26.
The fiscal stance is broadly appropriate, with maintenance of a low deficit
consistent with reducing external vulnerability and containing demand pressures.
To this end, the authorities will need to remain vigilant in recentralizing its fiscal
authority, to ensure it can avoid past problems with weak revenue collections and
spending oversight. Full implementation of the VAT should proceed carefully, including
formulation of a reasonable timetable and with sound technical advice. The government
should also carefully consider the size of its wage bill to ensure it is consistent with the
available budget envelope and does not crowd out more critical spending priorities. The
new SAF could potentially be used to address longer-term expenditure needs, but this
should be guided by a sound strategy for managing and using funds and anchored by a
medium-term fiscal framework.
27.
External viability and sustained growth will depend on sound development
and management of the resource sector. The potential rewards are large, but so are the
risks if poor sector governance comes with reduced external competitiveness, excessive
government indebtedness, or increased vulnerability to shocks. The authorities recognize
these challenges, but will also need to develop sound fiscal, legal, and regulatory
regimes, as well as environmental standards, to maximize gains from sector development.
28.
Important steps have been taken on banking reform, but the challenge
remains in ensuring banks further improve their financial soundness. Avoidance of a
costly recurrence of NPLs and disintermediation by the banking system necessitates a
commitment on the part of SOCBs to ensuring lending decisions are guided by proper
risk management and controls. On its part, the BoL will need to ensure its regulatory and
supervisory framework and capacity are supportive of developing a sound financial
system. To this end, adherence to the banking reform strategy developed with donor
partners and implementation of the new commercial bank law are key.
29.

It is recommended that Lao P.D.R. remain on the 12-month consultation cycle.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
LAO PEOPLE’S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
Joint IMF/World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis 20081
Prepared by the staffs of the International Monetary Fund and
the International Development Association
Approved by Daniel Citrin and Adnan Mazarei (IMF)
and Carlos Braga and Vikram Nehru (IDA)
July 7, 2008
This document presents the joint IMF-World Bank debt sustainability analysis (DSA) for
Lao P.D.R. using the Debt Sustainability Framework for Low-Income Countries (LIC).2
Lao P.D.R. is currently rated a weak performer with regard to its policies and institutions.3
This DSA assesses the impact of various exogenous shocks on the sustainability of external
and public sector debt under the baseline scenario.
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
The LIC DSA for Lao P.D.R. indicates that the country continues to face a high
risk of external debt distress. The public external debt service ratios are expected to remain
relatively low, owing to the concessionality of most of Lao P.D.R.’s official external
borrowing. However, the public external debt stock indicators are still well above the policydependant indicative thresholds, and could increase further depending on the macroeconomic
performance and the concessionality of external borrowing.

1

This DSA was prepared jointly by the IMF and World Bank. The staffs also consulted with the Asian
Development Bank’s office in Lao P.D.R. The debt data underlying this exercise were provided by the
Lao P.D.R. authorities.

Implications” (http://www.imf.org/external/np/pdr/sustain/2004/020304.htm and IDA/SECM2004/0035, 2/3/04)
and “Debt Sustainability in Low-Income Countries: Further Considerations on an Operational Framework,
Policy Implications” (http://www.imf.org/external/np/pdr/sustain/2004/091004.htm and IDA/SECM2004/0629,

In the LIC-DSA framework, the quality of a country’s policies and institutions is measured by the World
Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) index and classified into three categories: strong,
medium, and weak.

II. BACKGROUND AND ASSUMPTIONS
2.
Lao P.D.R.’s external public and publicly-guaranteed (PPG) debt stock remains
at elevated levels, but debt indicators have become more favorable in recent years,
supported by strong economic growth, a more stable macroeconomic environment, and
favorable external conditions. The total stock of external PPG debt in nominal terms was
US$2.4 billion at end-2007, or 60 percent of GDP, down from 77 percent at end-2005 and
66 percent at end-2006. It also declined as share of exports of goods and nonfactor services,
from an estimated 244 percent at end-2005 to 165 percent at end-2007. At these levels,
Lao P.D.R.’s debt stock indicators are still significantly above the policy-based indicative
thresholds (Figure 1). However, debt service ratios remain below the indicative thresholds,
reflecting the high degree of concessionality (see table below).
3.
Around 70 percent of PPG debt in Lao P.D.R. is held by multilateral creditors
(see table below), mainly the Asian Development Bank (AsDB) and International
Development Association (IDA). Slightly more than 25 percent is held by bilateral
creditors—mainly Russia, China, and Japan. New emerging market creditors are increasing
their presence in Lao P.D.R., necessitating the government ensure appropriate
concessionality from these lenders, given its current indebtedness. The remaining 5 percent is
estimated to be external debt incurred by public entities on nonconcessional terms and
guaranteed by the government, mainly for hydropower development and electricity
generation, including to finance equity stakes. In addition, some of this debt reflects
financing provided by multilateral and bilateral creditors to the government on concessional
terms and on-lent to state enterprises on nonconcessional terms.

4.
The size of domestic public debt is comparatively small. At end-fiscal year
2006/07, the stock of domestic public debt amounted to 1.8 percent of GDP. Total public
debt, including both domestic and external, was at 62.6 percent of GDP.
5.
Under the baseline scenario, the main underlying assumptions reflect the
continued pursuit in Lao P.D.R. of sound macroeconomic and financial policies and
structural reforms in support of growth and poverty reduction, and reduced external
vulnerability (Box 1).

3

Box 1: Main Assumptions for the Baseline Scenario (2008–28)
•

Real GDP growth is projected to average 7½ percent a year during 2008–13, with a modest pick-up
in nonresource sector growth (mainly from agriculture, light manufactures, and tourism and other
services) and continued strong resource sector growth. Over the longer term, growth is projected at
7 percent a year, given an expected leveling off in resource sector growth, but a further rise in
nonresource sector growth, including from a broader export base. Growth prospects are predicated
on the maintenance of macroeconomic stability; implementation of envisaged financial, trade, and
regulatory reforms; and improvements to public infrastructure and services, helping to raise
productivity. Prices of key commodities are broadly in line with the current WEO assumptions.1

•

The external current account deficit is projected to decline from 18–19 percent of GDP a year
during 2008–10 to 8½ percent by 2013 and further to 1 percent by 2025. Over the medium term,
resource project-related imports moderate, world oil prices stabilize, and new hydropower projects
(with large exports) come on stream. In the long run, nonresource export and services growth also
picks up, although staffs assume after reaching around 30 percent of GDP in 2015, total exports
would decline to around 25 percent by 2025, then begin to rise again, based on a conservative
forecast of mining output. However, nonresource export growth requires strengthened
competitiveness and regional integration, through improving the investment climate, streamlining
business regulation, and meeting trade commitments. The overall external position is expected to
stay reasonably strong reflecting private capital and official inflows. However, foreign direct
investment declines significantly starting in 2013, given fewer new mining and hydropower projects,
but picks up again in the outer years as foreign investment in the nonresource sector overtakes that in
the resource sector.

•

External financing is assumed to be largely on concessional terms.
¾ Multilateral creditors: For 2008–09, projected loan disbursements (including existing loans)
average around US$80 million. Thereafter, they are assumed to grow (in U.S. dollar terms) at
5 percent a year.
¾ Bilateral creditors: For 2008–09, projected loan disbursements average around US$125 million a
year. During 2010–14, they increase to an average of US$145 million in part to reflect new
financing expected for electricity development (see below), but thereafter fall back slightly to an
average of US$135 million.
¾ Commercial creditors: Staffs assume that two-thirds of planned investment in Electricité du
Laos’s (EDL) Power Development Plan 2007–2016 will be executed. One-half of the external
financing requirement is assumed to be met through government on-lending to EDL’s of funds
received from bilateral and multilateral creditors. The rest is assumed to be borrowed directly by
EDL on nonconcessional terms, but guaranteed by the government. Finally, a small amount of
nonconcessional borrowing is assumed for non-EDL related energy sector projects, as well as by
non-energy related state enterprises.

•

Macroeconomic stability is underpinned by a moderate fiscal stance. The overall deficit is
expected to stay in the range of 1–1½ percent of GDP over the medium term, mostly financed
externally (on concessional terms). Revenue would rise by about ¾–1 percentage point to around
16 percent of GDP by fiscal year 2012/13 (October–September) on increased tax buoyancy and a
broadening of the tax base. Resource revenue is projected to come down slightly and level off at
around 3 percent of GDP by 2010/11, but driven increasingly by electricity output and exports.
Grants would stabilize around 1.2–1.3 percent a years from 2008/09, based on the latest government
projections. Expenditure would rise slightly over the medium term to around 18¼ percent of
GDP—with about one-third as capital outlays.
_________________________

Copper prices for 2010–13 are assumed to be higher than the current WEO assumptions, based on discussions with
mine operators in Lao P.D.R. From 2010, the price per metric ton is kept constant at US$5,000.

III. EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
6.
Under the baseline scenario, external debt stock indicators will remain at
elevated levels over the medium term, but are expected to decline below the relevant
indicative thresholds within the projection period (Figure 1 and Table 1). The net present
value (NPV) of public external debt is expected to decrease from 46 percent of GDP at
end-2007 to 34 percent at end-2013, and to 14 percent of GDP by 2028, crossing the 30
percent indicative threshold by 2016. The debt service ratios (both as a share of exports and
government revenues) are expected to remain well below the indicative thresholds for the
entire projection period.

7.
External debt sustainability is most vulnerable to real exchange rate and export
price shocks (Tables 2a and 2b). In particular, real exchange rate shocks (including from
shocks to the GDP deflator or the nominal exchange rate) have the largest impact on the NPV
of debt-to-GDP as well as the NPV of debt-to-revenues ratios.4 Compared to 2008, a onetime 30 percent nominal depreciation of the kip exchange rate relative to the baseline would
raise the NPV of public external debt-to-GDP by 10 percentage points over the medium term,
and it would only fall below the 30 percent threshold in 2021. Similarly, a decline in export
value growth (including from commodity price shocks) in 2009–10, by one standard
deviation below its historical average, would raise the NPV of external debt-to-exports by
about 60 percentage points over the medium term before falling back below the threshold in
2021.
8.
Under an alternative scenario, Lao P.D.R.’s external debt situation could
deteriorate if expected returns to large resource project-related investments (mainly
hydropower) do not fully materialize (Figure 1 and Table 3), especially given the
nonconcessional nature of borrowing for this purpose. Assuming the volume of mining and
hydropower exports is 25 percent below the baseline and the value of nonresource exports 10
percent below from 2009 onward, the NPV of public external debt-to-GDP ratio would only

The most extreme stress test is defined as the bound test resulting in the most extreme deterioration of the debt
burden indicator after 10 years.

5
cross the 30 percent indicative threshold by 2019.5 The achievement of other thresholds would
be similarly delayed.
IV. PUBLIC SECTOR DEBT SUSTAINABILITY6
9.
The trajectory of public debt is expected to follow closely that of external debt,
as much of public debt is from external creditors (Figure 2 and Table 4). The NPV of
public debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to decrease from 50 percent at end-fiscal year 2006/07
to 39 percent at end-2012/13, and to 16 percent by end-2027/28.
10.
Public debt ratios are particularly sensitive to a real kip depreciation (Figure 2
and Table 5). Compared to 2007/08, a one-time 30 percent real depreciation of the kip
exchange rate would raise the NPV of public debt-to-GDP and the NPV of public debt-torevenue ratios by around 6 and 25 percentage points by 2012/13, respectively. A 10 percent
of GDP increase in other debt-creating flows would result in a sustained increase in the NPV
of public debt-to-GDP ratio by about 4 percentage points over the medium term.
V. CONCLUSION
11.
While Lao P.D.R. has made significant progress in reducing its external and public
debt burden, it still faces a high risk of debt distress. This reflects current and planned largescale investments in hydropower and mining projects that will only deliver returns over the
medium term. The outlook is particularly sensitive to changes in export and real GDP growth,
highlighting the vulnerability of debt dynamics in Lao P.D.R. to potential shocks and the
continued need to maintain macroeconomic stability and deepen structural reforms. Lao P.D.R.
could also further guard against these vulnerabilities by ensuring that any external borrowing is
obtained on concessional terms and by carefully managing fiscal and quasi-fiscal liabilities.
12.
Continued prudent debt management as well as cautious assessment and
monitoring of large-scale projects will be required to mitigate the risks posed to external
and public debt sustainability. Fiscal risk could arise if these projects fail to generate the
expected returns, including to the government’s own equity stake. Better disclosure of the
government’s medium-term borrowing plans, including for resource sector activity, would
greatly enhance the assessment of debt sustainability.

5

Nonresource exports are presumed to be affected by similar factors to those that might lower growth in
resource exports—lower-than-projected demand for final output; higher-than-expected costs for new projects,
reducing their scale and efficiency; fewer improvements to supporting infrastructure; etc.

6

In this section, ratios are stated on the basis of the fiscal year (ending September 30).

Includes both public and private sector external debt.
Derived as [r - g - r(1+g)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and r = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
Assumes that NPV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the NPV of new debt).

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock
(implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and r = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that NPV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the NPV of new debt).

Implementation of Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative (HIPC)

Lao P.D.R. is eligible for assistance under the HIPC Initiative. However, to date the authorities
have indicated that they do not want to avail themselves of this facility.

VIII.

Safeguards Assessments

A safeguards assessment of the Bank of Lao P.D.R. (BoL) was completed in April 2003 with
respect to the PRGF arrangement approved in 2001. The main findings, recommendations,
and progress thereon were reported in EBS/03/127 and SM/04/391. Progress on safeguards
recommendations has been slow. The authorities indicated that they were not in a position to
implement an earlier agreement to undertake a joint audit of the BoL’s 2003 and 2004
accounts by the state auditor and an international audit firm. These audits have subsequently
been completed by the state auditor, but the joint audit issue remains unresolved.
IX.

Exchange Rate Arrangement

In September 1995, Lao P.D.R. adopted a managed floating exchange rate system. The BoL
sets a daily official reference rate, based on the weighted average of the previous day’s
commercial bank and interbank rates. Effective September 2007, banks are allowed to adjust
their buying and selling rates within ± 0.25 percent of the BoL’s daily reference rate for the
U.S. dollar (previously ± 0.30 percent). Adjustment to other exchange rates are
correspondingly limited by adjustments to the U.S. dollar. Under the IMF’s current
classification scheme, the exchange rate arrangement is now a managed float with no predetermined path, with occasional interventions by the central bank.
X.

Exchange and Payments System

Lao P.D.R. no longer maintains restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for
current international transactions under the transitional arrangements of Article XIV,
Section 2, but maintains restrictions imposed for the preservation of national or international
security, which have been notified pursuant to Decision No. 144-(52/51), and a restriction
subject to IMF approval under Article VIII (tax payment certificates are required for some
transactions). A joint LEG/MCM mission in August 2004 conducted a review of the
exchange system to establish the remaining measures that would facilitate Lao P.D.R.’s
acceptance of the obligations under Article VIII, including the elimination of an exchange
restriction on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions.
XI.

Last Article IV Consultation Discussions

The last Article IV consultation discussions were held in Vientiane during April 25–May 7,
2007. The staff report (SM/07/271) was discussed by the Executive Board on August 3, 2007
and was published on November 7, 2007.

ANNEX II. LAO P.D.R.: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP1
IMF-World Bank Collaboration
The IMF takes the lead in advising the government of Lao P.D.R. on macroeconomic policy.
The support covers tax, fiscal, monetary, and exchange rate policies, and economic statistical
issues. The World Bank takes the lead in supporting the government in formulating a growth
and poverty reduction strategy and implementing structural reforms, such as in public finance
management; state-owned enterprise (SOE) restructuring; private sector development; trade,
legal, and judicial development; and natural resource management. The Bank and Fund
coordinate their work on some structural issues that have important implications on
macroeconomic performance, namely financial sector reform, public expenditure management,
trade policy, and poverty reduction strategy.
IMF and Bank Joint Role in Policy Dialogue
Poverty Reduction Strategy. The Bank and the IMF, together with the United Nations
Development Programme, have provided assistance to the government’s process of
formulating its medium-term poverty reduction strategy. In 2003, the government prepared
the first full Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, the National Growth and Poverty
Eradication Strategy (NGPES). The Bank and the Fund’s Joint Staff Advisory Note (JSAN)
of the strategy was presented before IDA and IMF Boards in November 2004. In 2006, the
government prepared the Sixth National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006–2010)
(NSEDP) with a strong poverty focus and through wide consultations with key domestic
stakeholders in Vientiane and provinces, as well as the Bank, IMF, and donors. The NSEDP
was presented by the government to its development partners at the 9th Round Table Meeting
in November 2006 and an annual progress report was provided at a Round Table
Implementation Meeting in November 2007.
The Bank is supporting the implementation of NGPES and NSEDP through the Poverty
Reduction Support Operations (PRSOs). The focus of PRSOs includes public finance
management reform, including in social sectors, and regional integration and private
sector development. PRSO-1 ($10 million) was approved in March 2005, followed by
PRSO-2 ($8 million) in April 2006 and PRSO-3 ($10 million) in June 2007. The next cycle
of PRSOs was approved by the Bank Board in June 2008.
Public Expenditure Management. The Bank has provided extensive technical assistance in
developing and implementing the government’s multi-year Public Expenditure Management
Strengthening Program (PEMSP). The Bank completed a Public Expenditure Review jointly
with the IMF, other donors, and government, and a Public Expenditure Tracking Survey

(PETS) for education and health sectors in 2006. The Bank is also assisting the government
in the preparation and implementation of a Government Finance Statistics Manualcompatible Chart of Accounts and the new Budget Law, focusing on improving intergovernmental fiscal relations.
Financial Sector Reforms. The Bank and the IMF have worked closely to support the
government in developing and implementing a banking reform program. The Bank has
supported restructuring of state-owned commercial banks (SOCBs) and drafting of banking
sector legislation, and is supporting the drafting of the Financial Sector Strategy.
Trade Policy. The Bank led preparation of the Diagnostic Trade Integration Study (DTIS),
jointly with the government, and other Integrated Framework donors. A Multi-Donor Trust
Fund (to be administered by the Bank) is currently being set up to support the action matrix
in the DTIS, and a Customs and Trade Facilitation Project is being designed in close
collaboration with the IMF to support customs modernization through implementation of an
automated customs system.
The Bank’s Key Roles in Policy Dialogue
State-Owned Enterprises. The Bank has supported the government’s SOE reform and
restructuring program, aimed at improving transparency by institutionalizing the reporting
and recording of annual performance of all SOEs and through international standard audits of
large SOEs, restructuring them to reduce losses or raise profits for public utility SOEs and
reforming their pricing policies in water, power, and telecoms. The SOEs are indebted to
SOCBs and a source of non-performing loans.
Private Sector Development. The Bank supports the development of the private sector, both
economy-wide and in the sectors, based on a joint AsDB-World Bank Investment Climate
Assessment of manufacturing and tourism firms, a review of key regulatory procedures and
business laws, and local government initiatives on private sector promotion. The Bank is also
a lead coordinator of a donor working group on macroeconomic and private sector
development issues, through which it conducts policy dialogue to improve the climate for
private investment, both domestic and foreign.
Forestry Development. The government is involved in a continuing process of reforming its
forestry sector and improving the implementation of forestry programs and projects. The Bank
is trying to ensure that the government’s strategy and objectives for forestry are consistent with
the NGPES, Rural Development Program, and Agriculture Development Strategy.
The Nam Theun 2 Hydropower Project. The Bank has supported the project through an
International Development Association (IDA) partial risk guarantee, an IDA grant for
environmental and social mitigation, and a Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency
(MIGA) guarantee, all done in March 2005. The World Bank decision to support the project
was based on a “decision framework” with the following three pillars: (i) Lao P.D.R.
establish and implement a viable development policy framework, characterized by concrete
performance, and national programs for poverty reduction and social and environmental

7
protection; (ii) the technical, financial, economic, and implementation aspects of the project,
as well as the design and implementation of sound safeguards policies; and (iii) wider
understanding and broader support from the international donor community, and global and
local civil society for Lao P.D.R.’s development framework and the project. The Bank is
supporting and monitoring the implementation of NT2, and its progress remains good; it is
expected to be operational in early 2010.
Bank Strategy and Lending Operations
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). The full CAS was presented to the Bank’s Board in
March 2005, and the CAS update (and extension through 2011) in May 2007. The CAS
selectively targets key NGPES priorities, including: (i) sustaining growth through linking to
and capitalizing on regional opportunities and better natural resource management;
(ii) improving social outcomes through strengthening financial management and service
delivery capacity; (iii) strengthening management capacities, partnerships, and monitoring
for NGPES implementation; and (iv) implementing the NT2 program as a model for
supporting sustainable growth, improving social outcomes, and building key development
capacities. The updated CAS consists of a lending and non-lending program, with a notional
amount of about US$170 million in new commitments (credits and grants) during
July 1, 2005 to June 30, 2011 (subject to the IDA Performance Based Allocation system).
Lending Operations
As of January 1, 2008, a total amount of US$863.9 million equivalent of IDA credits and
grants had been approved. This included support for adjustment operations, rural
development, forestry, transport, energy, telecommunications, education, health, industry,
capacity building, and risk guarantees. In the last three years, IDA support has focused on the
CAS objectives, with an average disbursement of US$41.9 million per year.

ANNEX III. LAO P.D.R.: RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK2
The Asian Development Bank (AsDB) has extended development assistance to Lao P.D.R. since
1968. In the 1970s and 1980s, AsDB assistance was focused mainly on economic growth projects
involving infrastructure development in the transport and energy sectors, as well as agriculture. AsDB
has been active in the development of the financial sector since the latter part of the 1980s, and
broadened its assistance to Lao P.D.R. to include rural development, social development, and
environment in the 1990s. AsDB has focused its activities on poverty reduction since the late 1990s.
AsDB’s new Country Strategy and Program (CSP) for Lao P.D.R. for 2007–11 is anchored in and
closely aligned to the Lao P.D.R.’s Sixth National Socio Economic Development Plan, 2006–2010
(NSEDP). A results-based strategy, the CSP focuses on promoting sustainable pro-poor sustainable
growth, strengthening governance, developing government’s capacity, improving social inclusiveness
and gender, enhancing regional cooperation and integration, managing the environment, and supporting
private sector (including banking) developments. These strategic foci are shaped by the country’s
specific requirements and capabilities after extensive stakeholder consultations. The CSP is designed to
achieve high impact and sustainable development results, and to contribute to the government’s
Millennium Development Goals and sector-specific commitments as set out in NSEDP, with specific
goals, targets, and progress indicators for AsDB interventions.
Lao P.D.R. is a key actor in the Greater Mekong Sub-Region (GMS) program as a land-link among
the other GMS member countries. The AsDB will aim to explore various options to maximize the
benefits to Lao P.D.R. from sub-regional cooperation. To enhance the development impact of projects
and ensure their close monitoring, AsDB’s interventions will focus primarily on the poor northern
regional provinces and along the East-West economic corridor that links Thailand to Savannakhet in
Lao P.D.R. and to Vietnam.
Since 1970, the AsDB has approved 73 loan and grant financed projects for a total of $1.18 billion—
of which 25 projects were currently active―and 228 technical assistance projects for a total of
$116.1 million (as of end-December 2007).
In 2007, AsDB program operations shifted to 100 percent grant. Three new grants were approved in
2007 comprising of the health systems program grant, the private sector and SME development
program grant, and the Greater Mekong Subregion transport network improvement program
(co-financing with $10 million from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries fund,
$14 million (grant) from Australia, and $23 million from the Republic of Korea). In addition, four
technical assistance projects amounting to $3.1 million were approved.

ANNEX IV. LAO P.D.R.: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Macroeconomic and financial data provided to the Fund have serious shortcomings
that significantly hamper surveillance. Priority should be placed on strengthening
balance of payments statistics and national accounts, as well as external public debt and
subnational fiscal accounts. Greater coordination between the various agencies responsible
for compiling macroeconomic statistics is needed. While a General Data Dissemination
System (GDDS) coordinator has been appointed, the authorities have yet to finalize the
GDDS metadata and a strategy for statistical improvement. Macroeconomic and financial
data are published in periodic reports by the National Statistical Center (NSC) and the Bank
of Lao P.D.R. (BoL).
National Accounts
National accounts comprise annual estimates of GDP by activity at current and constant
1990 prices, broadly following the System of National Accounts 1968. The lack of regular
surveys and use of inadequate methods to collect and compile comprehensive data on current
economic activities limit the coverage and reliability of the GDP estimates. The estimates
rely heavily on production and volume indicators collected by line ministries. With support
from the Swedish International Development Agency, the Lao Expenditure and Consumption
Survey 2002–03 (LECS) was finalized and released in 2005. In recent years, the NSC has
made some progress in improving the quality of source data, including the implementation of
annual enterprise and household surveys. In late 2006, a Statistics Department (STA)
regional advisor identified data gaps in the source data and issues on data quality, which need
to be addressed as well as in estimates of deflators and expenditures.
Prices
The NSC compiles a monthly CPI, with the latest basket introduced in January 2006 using
the results of the 2002/03 LECS. Similar to earlier CPI series, the consumption basket only
includes goods and services purchased in the market (i.e., excludes own consumption).
Government Finance
The Ministry of Finance’s (MOF) Budget Department produces monthly, quarterly, and
annual revenue and expenditure statistics. Most data are recorded on a cash basis. Data on
external and domestic debt are compiled by its External Financial Relations Department and
Budget Departments. Debt data are comprehensive and available by type of debt holder and
instrument. Efforts are being made to further improve coverage, particularly relating to
state-owned enterprises’ debt.
Overall, government finance statistics remain weak, with significant scope to improve their
accuracy, coverage, and timeliness. Annual budget and outturn data are also not disseminated
according to international standards. Greater decentralization in 2000/01 further complicated

11
the timely reporting of fiscal data, as province monitoring systems are weak and skilled staff
limited. The social security fund and off-budget activities are also not included in fiscal data.
In 2004, an STA mission recommended improvements to the quality of fiscal statistics and
developed a roadmap for eventual migration to Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001.
Currently, no fiscal data are reported for publication in the Government Finance Statistics
Yearbook or International Financial Statistics.
Monetary Statistics
The monetary and financial statistics mission in 2004 identified a number of problems in the
compilation of monetary statistics and made further recommendations on sectorization,
classification, and valuation. It also proposed improvement in the chart of accounts for BoL
and commercial banks, and reconciliation of monetary and government finance statistics.
Many of the recommendations of the mission have yet to be implemented, including those
related to sectorization of the commercial bank balance sheet. In addition, the authorities
have not submitted test data in the format of Standardized Report Forms that embody the
methodology of the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual.
Balance of Payments
Balance of payments (BOP) statistics are compiled on a quarterly and annual basis by the
BoL, with inputs from the NSC, MOF, and Ministry of Planning and Investment, as well as
commercial banks. Currently, certain major activities are unreported, with improvements
needed in all major categories of the current account, as well as foreign direct investment and
private capital flows. Data reconciliation as reported in the fiscal accounts and BOP on
external loans and grants also needs to be strengthened.
New customs procedures adopted in 2000 by the MOF’s Customs Department (with Fiscal
Affairs Department technical assistance) have yet to produce more accurate trade data on a
regular basis, due to technical reasons. More timely and accurate BOP estimates also require
improved coordination among agencies involved in their compilation. The government of
Japan is providing technical assistance to address some of these issues.
The BoL reports to the STA quarterly BOP data once a year in a highly aggregated format
that makes difficult their re-dissemination through STA’s publications (International
Financial Statistics and Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook). The last published data
correspond to 2001.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on Lao People’s Democratic Republic
July 30, 2008
The information provided below has become available since the issuance of the staff report.
The thrust of the staff appraisal remains unchanged.
1.
Headline inflation was virtually unchanged in June 2008—at 10.2 percent (y/y), held
down by a further appreciation of the kip and partial pass-through of world oil prices. Since
the beginning of 2008, the kip has been allowed to strengthen by around 7½ percent against
both the U.S. dollar and Thai baht. Retail pump prices were increased in Lao P.D.R. on
July 1, but at the time were 8–10 percent below full pass-through prices.
2.
Broad money growth was 32 percent (y/y) in May 2008, continuing to be fueled by
external inflows. Bank credit accelerated to 54 percent (y/y), with growth still mostly
attributable to the state-owned commercial banks. Gross official foreign reserves were
US$717 million at end-June 2008 (4.4 months of prospective nonresource imports)—in line
with staff’s projection for year end.
3.
The government presented its 2008/09 budget (October–September) to the National
Assembly in early July 2008. Both total revenue and recurrent expenditure are now expected
to be higher (as a share of GDP) than originally budgeted, but the overall deficit is broadly
unchanged. While the revised revenue target is now closer to staff’s projection for 2008/09,
higher recurrent spending appears associated with a larger-than-envisaged increase in
government wages. Under current plans, the wage bill would be equivalent to 5.2 percent of
GDP in 2008/09, compared to staff’s projection of 4.6 percent of GDP. Finally, the budget
does not appear to account fully for the capital costs associated with hosting the Southeast
Asia Games in 2009, which could now run as high as 1½–2 percent of GDP, but in part are
expected to be donor financed.
4.
The government has also indicated to the National Assembly that further measures
are being considered to limit food price inflation. These include establishing a rice reserve
and placing price controls on select agricultural inputs, as well as providing subsidies on
energy used and increasing credit available for food production.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
August, 19, 2008

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with the
Lao People's Democratic Republic
On July 30, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with the Lao People's Democratic Republic.1
Background
Lao P.D.R.’s economy has performed well in recent years, owing to generally stable
macroeconomic conditions and a rapidly expanding natural resource sector. Real GDP growth
has averaged more than 7 percent since 2004, with the resource sector (mining and
hydropower) now accounting for more than half of total investment and exports. Inflation has
moderated, and the kip has been allowed to strengthen. Despite a large external current account
deficit, the overall external position has improved, given a sizable increase in private and official
inflows. External public debt, as a share of GDP, also continues to decline in part due to
improved fiscal performance and given strong economic growth.
In 2007, real GDP growth was nearly 8 percent, fueled by the resource (investment), tourism,
and trading activity. Inflation picked up slightly, mainly reflecting global food and energy price
trends, with the headline rate at around 5½ percent (y/y) at year end. The external current

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every
year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country's
economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for
discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board,
summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities.

2
account deficit widened to more than 17 percent of GDP given a sharp rise in oil and capital
imports, the latter associated with large resource projects. Gross official reserves increased to
$539 million, or the equivalent of 3.7 months of prospective nonresource imports.2
Growth is projected to reach 7½ percent in 2008, driven by similar factors as last year, as well as
higher mining output. So far, global economic weakness and financial turbulence have had
limited impact on Lao P.D.R., but inflation pressures have continued to build. Headline inflation
was 10¼ percent (y/y) in June 2008 and is expected to stay in the low double digits through the
rest of the year, given recent trends in oil and food prices, but with aggregate demand pressures
also now a factor. Monetary conditions have become more lax since 2007, due to large external
inflows. Credit growth has also picked up considerably the past year—at 54 percent (y/y) in
May 2008—with much of the growth attributable to state-owned commercial banks. However,
fiscal performance continues to improve, with the overall budget deficit expected to decline by
1 percentage point in 2007/08 to 1.7 percent of GDP on higher resource and nonresourcerelated revenue.
Progress has been made on structural reforms, but much remains to be done. As a centerpiece
of the government’s banking reform strategy, the state-owned commercial banks continue to
undergo an operational and financial restructuring, with non-performing loans declining sharply
and banks beginning to recapitalize. Under the public finance management strengthening
program, initial steps have been taken to recentralize fiscal authority and improve overall
accountability, in line with the revised Budget Law. The government is also seeking ways to
improve the financial performance of large state-owned enterprises, including through external
audits.
The medium-term outlook for Lao P.D.R. remains positive, but hinges on sound development of
the resource sector and other steps to strengthen competitiveness. The resource sector itself is
expected to continue as a major driver of growth, although it poses potential fiscal risks and
remains vulnerable to external shocks. Despite increasing mineral and electricity exports, the
current account deficit is also projected to remain large over the next few years, on further
increases in oil and capital imports, before beginning to moderate. More balanced and sustained
high growth will require accelerated structural reforms, strengthened human capital, and sound
infrastructure development, supported by enhanced capacity in macroeconomic and resource
management. Under these conditions, external debt indicators should also continue to improve.

Nonresource imports exclude those imports associated with large mining (gold and copper) and hydropower projects.

3
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Lao authorities for their prudent macroeconomic
management and further progress on structural reforms, which have helped make the economy
more resilient to the global slowdown and financial turbulence. Growth has continued to be
strong, fueled by large-scale inflows into the natural resource sector, and the fiscal and overall
external positions have improved further. Directors noted that a combination of favorable
commodity prices and growing regional demand for hydropower is expected to help improve the
current account balance and sustain strong growth over the near to medium term. Nevertheless,
they recognized that the authorities face new challenges as Lao P.D.R.’s economy enters a
critical stage of development.
Directors stressed that longer-term growth prospects and job creation, particularly in the nonresource sector, will hinge importantly on a stable macroeconomic environment and a business
climate that is conducive to foreign investment. They encouraged the authorities to persevere
with sound macroeconomic policies and a strong reform agenda to help lower business costs,
attract foreign investment, and improve competitiveness. Given the risks associated with the high
level of external debt, Lao P.D.R. remains vulnerable to a deterioration in external conditions.
Directors accordingly underscored the importance of prudent debt management, including by
refraining from contracting non-concessional loans and strengthening control over quasi-fiscal
risks.
Directors recognized the difficult challenge of maintaining macroeconomic stability amidst the
rising oil and food prices. Large capital inflows have led to significant monetary expansion and
rapid credit growth, adding to demand pressures and risking stability gains. Directors generally
agreed that exchange rate appreciation has helped ease the burden of higher import costs, but
encouraged the authorities to take further steps to tighten monetary policy in order to reduce
inflationary pressures. In the near term, Directors recommended the use of the available indirect
instruments to manage domestic liquidity, coupled with tighter prudential regulations to contain
credit growth, in particular at state-owned commercial banks (SOCBs). They considered that the
more flexible exchange rate policy, complemented with measures to deepen the foreign
exchange market, will help underpin monetary tightening and enhance the economy’s resilience
to external shocks. Directors noted the staff’s assessment that the real effective exchange rate is
broadly in line with fundamentals.
Directors agreed that the fiscal stance aimed at further consolidation is broadly appropriate, and
will contribute to reducing external vulnerability and containing demand pressures. This should
be complemented by further reforms to broaden the tax base, and strengthen revenue
collections and spending oversight. Directors encouraged the authorities to remain vigilant in
recentralizing the government’s fiscal authority. They suggested that the implementation of the
new value-added tax should proceed carefully, underpinned by a reasonable timetable and
sound technical preparations, and building on a broader reform of the tax system. It will also be
important to reform the civil service and ensure that the government’s wage bill is consistent with
the available budget envelope and does not crowd out critical spending priorities.
Directors considered that sound development and management of the resource sector will be
crucial, given its potential contribution to external viability, debt sustainability, and overall growth.
Appropriate fiscal and regulatory regimes, as well as proper environmental standards, will help to
maximize gains from sector development and improve governance. Directors accordingly called

4
for the development of a comprehensive strategy for resource management, anchored in a
medium-term fiscal framework, and welcomed the operationalization of the State Accumulation
Fund as a resource for addressing longer-term expenditure needs. Directors suggested that Lao
P.D.R. participate in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative.
Directors welcomed the substantial progress in banking reform, notably the passage of the
commercial bank law and the reduction of nonperforming loans (NPLs) at SOCBs. Further steps
will be necessary to restructure SOCBs and put in place proper risk management and controls to
avoid a costly recurrence of NPLs and disintermediation by the banking system. Directors
encouraged the central bank to continue to strengthen its regulatory and supervisory framework.
Key elements in further progress will be the full implementation of the banking reform strategy and
of the new banking law. It would also be important to bring the AML/CFT framework fully in line
with international standards.
Directors noted that data deficiencies have hampered the surveillance process. They called on
the authorities to give priority to improving balance of payments, national income, and external
debt statistics, and to strengthen coordination among statistical agencies.
