DISCUSSIONS

KEY MESSAGES
Setting. Discussions took place for the first time since the handover of Macao SAR from
Portugal to China in 1999. Prudent macroeconomic management has underpinned rapid
development in the territory, which is now the world’s largest gaming center. As a small,
open and tourism-dependent economy, Macao SAR is currently also benefiting from loose
global monetary conditions and a Mainland-related boom.
Outlook and risks. Growth should stay strong over the next few years at 8–10 percent
buoyed by gaming exports and investment, with inflation remaining around 5–5½ percent.
However, the economy is vulnerable to external shocks, in particular a slowdown in tourism,
due to shocks in the Mainland or Hong Kong SAR or other setbacks to the global recovery.
The buoyant property market could also correct if demand fundamentals shift or interest
rates rise abruptly with the withdrawal of unconventional monetary policy abroad.
Macroeconomic policies. The policy stance is appropriate, with scope for further
tightening of macroprudential policies should property prices continue to rise sharply. If
downside risks materialize, targeted fiscal stimulus should be used to buttress growth. In
the event of a severe property downturn, some countervailing measures could be
cautiously unwound. The currency board is the best arrangement for Macao SAR.
Financial stability. Important progress has been made in strengthening financial stability in
line with the 2011 FSAP recommendations. Prudential measures should focus on managing
potential credit and liquidity risks from a gaming slowdown and the property sector, as well
as spillovers from shocks in the Mainland and Hong Kong SAR.
Longer term challenges. Looking further ahead, Macao SAR’s public finances face a
moderation in gaming revenues juxtaposed against spending needs from population aging.
A sovereign wealth fund to manage part of the territory’s fiscal reserves and medium-term
budgeting could therefore be useful. As the gaming sector matures, economic
diversification toward other services will be key for stable growth.

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA—MACAO SAR

CONTEXT
1.
After more than 400 years of Portuguese rule, Macao SAR returned to China’s
sovereignty at the end of 1999. Discussions took place with the consent of the Chinese authorities.
They were the first since the handover, although the IMF has maintained a relationship with Macao
SAR, focused mainly on technical assistance and training (including an FSAP in 2011). Like
neighboring Hong Kong SAR, Macao is a Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of
China. With its economic and social systems remaining unchanged for 50 years under its governing
constitution (The Basic Law), the territory is a free port and separate customs jurisdiction.
2.
Macao SAR is a small and highly open economy, with a population of around 600,000 spread
over only 31km2. Its economic fortunes are driven by tourism, mainly related to the gaming industry.
Visitors originate mostly from the Mainland and Hong Kong SAR, and rose to a record-high of 29 million
in 2013. Gaming directly accounts for four-fifths of exports, three-quarters of fiscal revenue, one-quarter
of employment, and more than half of GDP at current producer prices (Figure 1 and Appendix II).
3.
A decade-long gaming boom has lifted per capita incomes near global highs. For the first
three years after the handover, the economy was mired in deflationary growth in the aftermath of a
property slump, a sharp rise in bad loans, and dwindling tourism due to the Asian crisis and SARS.
After February 2002, liberalization of the casino industry and relaxation of tourist travel policies by
the Mainland revitalized the economy. By the middle of the decade, Macao SAR had overtaken Las
Vegas as the largest gaming center in the world. However, inflationary pressures—both consumer
and property prices—have picked up, and inequality has remained a concern during this period of
rapid growth.
4.
Prudent macroeconomic management has enabled Macao SAR to navigate global and
regional shocks, to which it is exposed due to its openness and narrow base. The policy framework
has served Macao SAR well in maintaining financial stability and a strong external position, while
successfully weathering several external shocks, including the recent global crisis. It is anchored by
the combination of a currency board pegged to the Hong Kong dollar (and hence indirectly the U.S.
dollar), flexible markets, and a commitment to safeguarding fiscal discipline and financial stability.


Monetary conditions. Under the currency board arrangement, domestic liquidity grows in line with
international reserves and monetary conditions are tied to those in Hong Kong SAR (and thus
ultimately the United States). The domestic currency, the pataca, is more than 100 percent
backed by foreign assets.



External position. Macao SAR is a net external creditor, with a sizable current account surplus,
large foreign reserves, and no exchange restrictions on current and capital account transactions
(Figure 2). The real effective exchange rate has appreciated in recent years, mirroring
developments in the U.S. dollar.



Public finances. Owing to the boom in the gaming sector and cautious management of public
finances, Macao SAR has enjoyed large fiscal surpluses in recent years. It has no public debt and
holds fiscal reserves of nearly 60 percent of GDP, serving as a key buffer against external shocks.

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA—MACAO SAR



Financial system. At nearly 250 percent of GDP, Macao SAR’s financial sector is large, bank
dominated, and mainly foreign owned (Figure 3). Local banking operations have strong balance
sheets, are flush with liquidity through domestic deposits, and benefit from the financial and risk
management support of their parent banks. There are no organized capital markets and about
60 percent of financial assets are external.

5.
Supportive policies in the United States and the Mainland also helped Macao SAR
rebound from the global crisis. After averaging 14 percent during the preceding six years, growth
fell to low single-digits in 2008 and 2009, as tourism plummeted following a tightening of visa
policies by the Mainland and the onset of the global recession. Growth recovered quickly thereafter,
lifted by two major forces. First, the loosening of monetary conditions in the United States, which led
to a corresponding fall in domestic interest rates, facilitated rapid credit growth aimed at both
domestic and external borrowers, and increased foreign inflows into Macao SAR’s property sector.
Second, the strong recovery in the Mainland and its supportive measures toward the territory—
including speeding up cross-boundary infrastructure projects and facilitating greater economic and
financial integration—helped boost investment and service exports.
6.
The outlook is bright, but Macao SAR needs to prepare for future shifts in the global
and domestic landscape. With the United States beginning to withdraw from unconventional
monetary policy as its economy gains strength and the Mainland engaging in major structural
reforms to rebalance its growth, Macao SAR will face a different global environment. This will bring
opportunities for further development of services that Macao SAR should position itself to seize.
At the same time, macroeconomic and prudential policies may need to be recalibrated as these
shifts may heighten volatility. Over a longer horizon, growth could slow as the gaming sector
matures and the population ages. As a result, Macao SAR will need to preserve its traditional
strengths by bolstering financial soundness, ensuring external stability, maintaining fiscal prudence,
and diversifying the economy. These issues formed the basis of the discussions, as described below.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
7.
The economy has continued to perform strongly over the last year. Growth rose to
11.9 percent in 2013 from 9.1 percent the previous year, driven by a pick-up in gaming exports (Table 1).
Robust activity and low unemployment kept inflation relatively elevated at 5½ percent.
Notwithstanding some countervailing measures by the government, property prices increased by
nearly 40 percent again last year, supported by rising incomes and low interest rates. The banking
system remains in solid health, with robust growth in both deposits and loans.
8.
Under the baseline global outlook, Macao SAR’s prospects are highly favorable (Table 2).
Growth is likely to remain robust, at 8-10 percent through 2017, on the back of gaming exports as
the global economy strengthens and continued investment related to several casino expansion
projects, including construction of hotels and large entertainment complexes. Amid brisk activity and
historically low unemployment, inflation should stay around 5-5½ percent. At the same time,
demand for property will continue to be supported by strong economic growth and low, albeit
slowly rising, interest rates. The current account is expected to decline as a share of GDP, as the
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

5

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA—MACAO SAR

services surplus narrows due to capacity constraints in the tourism sector while the merchandise
trade deficit rises somewhat due to capital and raw material imports associated with high
investment. Meanwhile, the capital and financial account should remain in deficit as the public
sector accumulates assets overseas due to rising fiscal reserves and banks continue to lend abroad,
taking advantage of rising external demand and interest rates as the global recovery gains
momentum. In 2018 and 2019, private investment will contract as work on expansion projects is
completed. As a result, growth is likely to moderate to mid-single digits. The current account surplus
should tick up, reflecting a slowdown in goods imports and a pick-up in service exports as new
capacity comes on line.
9.
However, given the economy’s narrow base, a potential sharp drop in tourism and
gaming revenues is a core risk. Such a decline could stem from a renewed downturn or protracted
stagnation in the United States and euro area that stalls the global recovery, a severe slowdown in
the Mainland or Hong Kong SAR or a fall in visitors due to visa policy changes in the Mainland or
any weaknesses in Macao SAR’s AML/CFT framework (see risk matrix in Appendix I). In addition to
hurting growth and fiscal revenue, such shocks could lead to liquidity strains and deterioration in
banks’ asset quality.

growth or a sharp rise in interest rates, due to
faster-than-anticipated withdrawal of unconventional monetary policy abroad or increased financial
market volatility in its wake (mirroring developments in the United States due to the currency
board). A severe downturn in the property market could have a significant negative impact on credit
quality, fiscal revenue, and overall economic performance. Construction accounts for around
80 percent of fixed capital information, around 4.7 percent of GDP in value-added terms, and nearly
10 percent of employment. The financial sector is also exposed, with mortgages and the
construction sector together accounting for almost half of private domestic credit.

Authorities’ views:
Outlook and risks. The authorities agreed with the baseline outlook. While acknowledging that
Macao SAR is susceptible to external shocks, they felt that risks were receding, particularly with
the global recovery in train and the Mainland’s strong reform plan for rebalancing its economy.
On balance, the authorities view the normalization of US monetary policy as beneficial for
Macao SAR, since it should normalize domestic interest rates, cool property prices, and contain
imported inflation as the exchange rate strengthens with the U.S. dollar. They noted that global
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA—MACAO SAR

financial markets expect the exit to be gradual and well-executed with interest rates only rising slowly
over time, and therefore do not anticipate significant volatility. Even in the extreme event of a bumpy
exit, they felt Macao SAR’s vulnerability is reduced by the paucity of short-term capital inflows, owing
to the persistent surplus position of the public and private sectors and lack of domestic money or
capital market instruments. Nevertheless, they recognized that there could be a more tangible impact
on domestic credit conditions and the property market.


Property market. The authorities felt that the rise
in property prices was reflective of fast income
growth, very tight supply of land, and loose
global monetary conditions. While it was hard to
determine the fair value of housing in this
environment, they were concerned about
worsening affordability and focusing attention
on containing any financial stability risks that
may arise. They were encouraged that measures
implemented in the last few years—including

duties—have helped cool the market by slowing transactions, lowering the share of property-related
loans, and reducing foreign speculative activity. On the latter, they noted that the share of
nonresidents in the total value of property purchases had fallen from over 20 percent in 2011 to less
than 5 percent in 2013. Notwithstanding the territory’s space constraints, supply is also being
mobilized to help meet rising demand, with 19,000 public housing units completed in the last few
years and plans for reclaiming around 3.5 km2 of land.
1

CALIBRATING MACROECONOMIC POLICIES
12.
Under the baseline, current macroeconomic policies are set to continue. Maintaining the
authorities’ cautious approach to fiscal management, the 2014 budget is based on conservative revenue
projections and another sizable surplus is expected (Table 3). The fiscal stance and recent surpluses provide
a cushion to withstand any future downturns. This is especially important given the absence of monetary
policy discretion under the currency board arrangement.
13.
Macroprudential policies remain focused on strengthening the resilience of the
banking sector to risks from a slowdown in gaming and rapidly rising property prices. The
gaming sector is predominantly financed overseas, but banks are indirectly exposed through
lending for gaming operators’ working capital and related industries (such as hotels and
construction), as well as the sector’s importance to the wider economy. Bank exposure to the
property market is significant, and debt service on mortgage loans is around 25 percent of household
incomes based on newly-approved mortgage data. The banking system has buffers to cushion shocks
through solid profits and strong capital positions, as well as potential support that foreign banks could
provide to their branches or subsidiaries operating in Macao SAR. To further mitigate these risks and
identify potential weak points, industry-wide stress testing that captures both domestic and external

shocks and dynamic provisioning should be established. At the same time, close scrutiny of the drivers

prudential measures. The authorities have taken a

quarters.

14.
If shocks materialize, fiscal and prudential policies will need to be deployed as the
main defense. In the first instance, automatic stabilizers should be allowed full play, although these
are fairly small. If growth slows more significantly, Macao SAR could undertake rapid fiscal stimulus
to shore up domestic demand through targeted tax relief and direct transfers to vulnerable
households, support for SMEs, and accelerated infrastructure spending. Should the growth
slowdown be accompanied by significant financial strains, liquidity and capital support could be
temporarily made available to banks, as was announced during the onset of the global crisis. If
domestic monetary conditions tighten suddenly due to the withdrawal of unconventional monetary
policy, there may be scope for a macroprudential response, including using capital buffers to avoid a
procyclical contraction in lending and monitoring market developments to decide whether and
when measures should be recalibrated. In particular, if the property market experiences a sharp
downturn, some prudential measures that were tightened during the upswing could be selectively
and judiciously unwound, in line with dissipation in systemic risks.
15.
Authorities’ views. The authorities agreed that the fiscal surplus envisaged for 2014 was
appropriate, bolstering resources available to withstand any future shocks and underpinning
confidence in the currency board. Given that property prices continue to rise, they remain vigilant to
further acceleration, and could consider additional measures aimed at constraining housing credit supply
and speculative demand to contain systemic risks. If shocks materialize, they concurred that fiscal and
prudential policies would be the main tools to buttress growth and contain risks to financial stability.
While they viewed the sudden tightening of monetary conditions as a low-probability event, they
would continue to monitor closely market developments, notably with regard to the property
sector. With banks having strong buffers—the average capital adequacy ratio stands at around
15 percent—and average household debt service-to-income ratios of around 30 percent, they felt
that the economy should be able to withstand some price correction under such a scenario. If prices
fell more precipitously, they were open to the idea of unwinding some housing-related measures
enacted in recent years, They emphasized that they would only consider such unwinding provided it
did not pose systemic risk, for instance by attracting less creditworthy buyers as the cycle turns, and
thus harming household balance sheets and potentially weakening financial stability in the future

BOLSTERING FINANCIAL SOUNDNESS
16.
Macao SAR’s financial system is bank oriented and foreign owned, with virtually all banks
being either subsidiaries or branches of overseas banks. Banks fund themselves primarily through
domestic deposits, placing the majority of their excess liquidity with their parent banks and offshore
affiliates. If needed, branches can borrow liquidity from their parent banks. Macao SAR’s banking
system is dominated by Mainland and Hong Kong SAR-owned banks—together, they account for
almost 85 percent of total bank assets. The financial system appears competitive, featuring
26 commercial banks, two offshore banks, a postal savings bank and other credit institutions,
insurance companies, finance companies, securities dealers, and pension funds.

systemic financial stability. In this context, staff’s Financial Stability Map suggests that the improving
global economy and strong domestic growth have increased risk appetite, while low global interest
rates and expanding money supply have eased monetary and financial conditions. As a result, Macao
SAR is facing elevated risks from potential inward spillovers and market and liquidity shocks, and
low to medium ones with regard to the macroeconomy and credit quality.
1

18.
Financial system resilience has been bolstered by the progress made on key
recommendations from the IMF’s 2011 Financial Assessment Program (FSAP) (Box 3 and
Table 4). The FSAP concluded that banks generally enjoy robust capitalization and adequate
profitability. In line with its recommendations, progress has been made in further strengthening the
supervisory framework, including by enhancing off-site analysis and improving communication with
parent financial institutions. In addition, the financial safety net has been bolstered by the
introduction of a deposit insurance scheme. Increasing the de jure operational independence of the
Monetary Authority of Macao (AMCM) and developing a rapid remedial action framework to
facilitate an orderly approach to addressing banking problems are being considered in the ongoing
review of the Financial System Act, and Macao SAR plans to adopt fully the International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS) to enhance the transparency of banks’ financial reporting. It is important
to implement these remaining recommendations expeditiously.
19.
Given heightened exposure to a few jurisdictions, close monitoring and co-operation
with their home supervisors will help guard against adverse cross-border financial spillovers

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

9

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA—MACAO SAR

Counterparty risk is high, given that banks place the bulk of their surplus liquidity with banks
abroad. At the same time, concentration risk has also risen due to increased bank exposure to a few
jurisdictions, although mostly with high sovereign ratings and strong fundamentals. In particular,
there are risks from lending to Hong Kong SAR, Portugal and the Mainland (together accounting for
around two-thirds of external interbank assets). Credit and funding shocks emanating in these
jurisdictions could have a significant impact on the domestic banking system (Box 4). To identify
emerging risks, the AMCM should stress test and closely monitor banks’ foreign exposures,
including through closer cooperation with home supervisors and an assessment of financial stability
developments in those jurisdictions, while ensuring that banks maintain prudent underwriting
standards and hold adequate buffers against potential risks. Publicizing more details about the
nature of these exposures—including granular information on lenders, borrowers, and risk
implications—would also provide useful information to supervisors, the market and the public.
20.
Steps to strengthen further the AML/CFT framework are welcome. In 2007, Macao SAR
underwent a mutual evaluation of its anti-money laundering and combating the financing of
terrorism (AML/CFT) framework by the Asia Pacific Group on Money Laundering (APG). The areas
found to have room for improvement included customer due diligence measures on financial
institutions and designated nonfinancial businesses and professions (DNFBPs), confiscation and
freezing of criminal assets, targeted financial sanctions required by UN Security Council resolutions,
regulation and supervision of DNFBPs, measures on cross-border transportation of cash and bearer
negotiable instruments, and international cooperation. In light of the information in Macao SAR’s
progress reports to the APG and of the risks faced by the gaming sector, remaining measures
needed to safeguard integrity in the gaming sector should be steadfastly implemented, in particular
to bolster customer due diligence requirements in line with the Financial Action Task Force (FATF)
standard, and to strengthen oversight of all market players, including junket promoters and their
associates.
21.
Authorities’ views. The authorities noted that significant progress has been made in
bolstering financial stability in recent years, in line with FSAP recommendations. In addition,
banks conduct regular reviews on the effectiveness of their risk management practices, internal
controls and business strategies, and submit them to the AMCM on an annual basis. Any
deficiencies identified by the AMCM require prompt remedial measures. Banks are also required to
conduct their own stress tests and AMCM is working toward implementing sector-wide stress
testing. In terms of cross-border financial spillovers, they pointed out that linkages with Hong Kong
SAR and Portugal are long-standing and reflect limited domestic lending opportunities. More
recently, lending to the Mainland has risen briskly to around 20 percent of banks’ overseas portfolio,
spurred by increased integration and interest differentials. They noted that two Mainland banks
account for the majority of these exposures, which are mainly related to trade financing, backed by
collateral and letters of guarantee from their headquarters, and not to potentially more risky
segments of the Mainland financial system (including “shadow” banks). If necessary, banks also have
the discretion to off-load bad assets to their headquarters under local banking regulations. These
features reduce credit risks. Nevertheless, as exposures will rise further with Mainland integration
and given liquidity/counterparty risks, the authorities agreed that maintaining close cooperation
with Mainland supervisors and publicizing more detailed information on exposures would be
worthwhile. In terms of bolstering the AML/CFT framework, they noted that several steps have been
10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA—MACAO SAR

taken in light of the APG recommendations. In particular, guidelines for financial institutions have
been revised, junket promoters have been incorporated into customer due diligence measures, and
the Financial Intelligence Unit has strengthened its ability to cooperate with its foreign counterparts.

ENSURING EXTERNAL STABILITY
22.
Macao SAR’s external position is broadly consistent with medium-term fundamentals and
desirable policies (Box 5 and Table 5). Exchange rate valuation models yield a broad range of
estimates, which is not surprising given the uncertainty in such assessments for offshore centers like
Macao SAR, whose gross exports and external assets are considerably larger than in other
economies. The current account surplus mainly reflects the on-going gaming boom rather than any
fundamental misalignment of the exchange rate or other undesirable policies. As a result, there is no
convincing evidence of misvaluation. That said, in the event that the government were to scale up
spending on health and education over the medium term (see below), this could lead to a somewhat
lower national savings rate, requiring the real exchange rate to adjust to a more depreciated
equilibrium level.
23.
The currency board linked to the Hong Kong dollar is the best arrangement for Macao
SAR and should be maintained. Given its small and very open economy, the system has provided a
crucial nominal anchor for Macao SAR, helped maintain economic and financial stability, and kept
the real effective exchange rate broadly in equilibrium. It has also overseen generally good
economic performance. Macao SAR meets the pre-requisites for sustaining a currency board,
namely flexible labor and product markets that prevent sizable or persistent misalignments, fiscal
discipline, prudent management of foreign exchange reserves, and robust financial sector regulation
and supervision (Table 6). As with all currency board arrangements, adjustment to shocks has had to
take place through price movements, such that both headline and property price inflation have been
higher and more volatile than in economies with

Authorities’ views. The authorities agreed that the currency board is the most desirable
arrangement for Macao SAR. They also felt that the link with the Hong Kong dollar was appropriate,
particularly given strong real and financial linkages with Hong Kong SAR. In terms of the renminbi,
they concurred that the Mainland’s capital account restrictions complicate its viability as a peg,

including in terms of honoring unlimited convertibility and as a store of value for absorbing Macao
SAR’s large surpluses. The authorities also broadly shared staff’s external assessment, with the
territory’s flexible prices keeping the real exchange rate in equilibrium and a medium-term current
account surplus of around 40 percent of GDP justified by the present gaming boom.

SUSTAINING FISCAL PRUDENCE
25.
Macao SAR’s traditionally healthy fiscal position may face pressures over the longer
term. Macao SAR has no public debt and holds significant fiscal reserves that should be sufficient to
offset shocks without an accumulation of public debt. However, the government is heavily
dependent on gaming revenues, which are volatile and will slow as the sector matures and faces
greater competition from online gaming and other venues in Asia. At the same time, spending
pressures will mount due to population aging—with the old-age dependency ratio forecast to rise
from 10 to 30 percent by 2030—and the possibility of increased social spending and investments to
diversify the economy (Figure 5). Currently, these are addressed through ad-hoc measures, such as
cash transfers to citizens and public injections into the pension fund.
26.
To ensure the best use of resources over time, consideration could be given to
embedding a longer horizon into fiscal policy decisions.


Establishing a medium-term budget framework. Macao SAR currently has a one-year horizon in
its budget, with limited forecasting of expenditure and revenue. The main items are for the most
part based on the previous year’s budget and there is no multi-year costing of expenditure
programs, such that outcomes tend to be significantly different. Moving toward a medium-term
budget framework would help promote transparency, support fiscal discipline, and ensure that
growth in spending is consistent with development and fiscal objectives. Without such a
framework, there is a risk of procyclicality in spending that could exacerbate the impact of
shocks and harm fiscal sustainability. Based on international experience, consideration could be
given to building capacity for formulating forecasts for revenue, spending and the fiscal balance
over a 3–5 year horizon that are embedded into the annual budget. These could be prepared by
the Ministry of Finance in consultation with other government agencies. Over time, based on the
experience of other countries facing population aging, a Long-term Fiscal Report covering the
next few decades may also be a useful device to inform the public about future fiscal pressures,
and develop and evaluate policy options. Both these exercises should incorporate the likely
slowdown in gaming revenues as well as potential spending obligations associated with
population aging, promoting economic diversification, and addressing inequality.



Setting up a sovereign wealth fund. There may be merit to allocating some part of the fiscal
reserves to a sovereign wealth fund (SWF) with a clear mandate to achieve better risk-adjusted
returns over a long-term horizon, including through a more diversified asset allocation strategy.
This would help build sustainable buffers that could be used to offset the impact of potential
adverse shocks and set money aside to fund long-term aging expenditures. International
experience suggests that a variety of institutional arrangements are possible for a SWF, including
having the monetary authority manage the assets, often with the help of external fund managers
(Box 6 and text table). In terms of the governance of SWFs, the Santiago Principles developed in

27.
Authorities’ views. In light of the impending aging of Macao SAR’s population, the authorities
agreed with the need for incorporating a longer-term horizon into fiscal policy decisions. They noted
that preserving fiscal discipline was of paramount importance, as enshrined in the Basic Law. In particular,
they acknowledged the desirability of boosting returns on the fast rising fiscal reserves associated with
the current gaming boom. From this year, the AMCM has decided to invest around 10 percent of the
reserves in equities, including with the help of external managers. They were willing to contemplate
further moves in this direction, such as by establishing a sovereign wealth fund under government
control for part of the fiscal reserves. However, they emphasized that these would need to be backed by
a clear increase in risk tolerance and willingness to judge performance over a long-term horizon.

DIVERSIFYING THE ECONOMY
28.
Economic diversification is crucial for sustaining Macao SAR’s growth over the longer
term. Much of the territory’s recent strong growth has been concentrated in the tourism sector. Even
within tourism, it is predominantly considered a gaming center and a daytrip destination for residents of
the Mainland and Hong Kong SAR. Looking forward, economic growth will likely moderate as the
gaming sector slows to a more sustainable pace amid capacity constraints, government controls on
expansion of gaming tables, and external competition. In addition, this narrow concentration leaves the
territory vulnerable to external disturbances, as well as crowding out resources from the rest of the
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA—MACAO SAR

economy. Therefore, diversification is a key policy objective and could provide the economy with an
additional growth engine. In this context, the following strategic options could be further explored:


Nurturing comparative advantages. Given Macao SAR’s small size, there are limits to how much the
economy can be diversified, especially with respect to manufacturing since land and unit labor costs
are high. Nevertheless, increasing public investments in infrastructure as well as in social sectors will
help reduce capacity constraints, lower inequality, and build the human capital required for modern
nongaming services. Public spending on health and education, as well as the percentage of the labor
force with tertiary education—at around 1¾ and 2½ percent of GDP, and 25 percent, respectively—
are relatively low by international standards. In addition, addressing labor shortages may call for
some relaxation of policies related to importing workers and further facilitation of workers
commuting from neighboring parts of the Mainland. Further financial development, including SME
financing, could also help tap new service industries.



Broadening linkages with the Mainland. The

Authorities’ views. Diversification of the economy toward nongaming services is a key goal
of the government. Key policy measures include promoting competition and diversification in existing
industries, upgrading transportation and logistics, fostering a more favorable business environment, and
encouraging development and growth of nongaming services. The Mainland’s 12th Five-Year Plan
(2011–15) also supports Macao SAR’s development into a world tourism and leisure centre and as an
economic and trade co-operation platform for China and Portuguese-speaking countries. Progress is
being made in several areas. For instance, the transport network should improve in the coming years
with the completion of light-rail system, labor and visitor flows from the Mainland are being facilitated
through new cross-border checkpoints, and 5 km2 of land in Hengqin island has been reserved for joint
development of an industrial park. The authorities hoped that further development of the nearly 100km2
Hengqin island could help alleviate Macao SAR’s significant land constraints. In addition, they saw
opportunities for further RMB business, particularly capital raising by entities from Portuguese-speaking
countries.

STAFF APPRAISAL
30.
Macao SAR has come a long way since its handover to China in 1999.
Prudent macroeconomic management—anchored by a currency board, flexible markets, and a
commitment to fiscal discipline and financial stability—has seen the territory make significant strides.
Together with a gaming boom, it has lifted average living standards to among the highest in the world
and enabled Macao SAR to successfully weather external shocks, including the recent global crisis.
However, inflationary pressures have picked up and inequality remains a concern.
31.
As the global recovery gains momentum, Macao SAR will need to adapt to a shifting
external backdrop. Macao SAR’s rebound from the global crisis benefited from the loosening of
monetary conditions in the United States, which led a corresponding fall in domestic interest rates and
facilitated rapid credit growth, as well as strong growth in the Mainland. With this benign landscape
shifting as the United States withdraws from unconventional monetary policy and the Mainland engages
in major structural reforms to transform its economy, Macao SAR will face both opportunities and
challenges. Looking ahead, preserving Macao SAR’s traditional strengths by bolstering financial
soundness, ensuring external stability, maintaining fiscal prudence, and diversifying the economy will be
critical for stable growth.
32.
The outlook is strong but the economy’s narrow base leaves it vulnerable to external
shocks. Growth should stay at 8–10 percent over the next few years buoyed by gaming exports and
investment, with inflation remaining around 5–5½ percent. However, growth rates are vulnerable to
external shocks. Risks mainly stem from a slowdown in tourism, due to shocks in the Mainland or
Hong Kong SAR or other setbacks to the global recovery, or a fall in visitors due to visa policy changes
in the Mainland or any weaknesses in Macao SAR’s AML/CFT framework. The main domestic risk is a
sharp property market correction if demand fundamentals shift or interest rates rise sharply, reflecting
faster-than-anticipated withdrawal of unconventional monetary policy abroad or increased financial
market volatility in its wake.
33.
The current macroeconomic policy stance is appropriate. The fiscal stance envisaged for
2014 and recent surpluses are sensible, with fiscal reserves providing a cushion to withstand any future
downturns. This is especially important given the absence of discretionary monetary policy. There is
scope for a further tightening of housing-related taxes and macroprudential policies if property prices
continue to rise sharply. The currency board arrangement with the Hong Kong dollar link has served
Macao SAR well and should be maintained. Given its small and very open economy, the system provides
a crucial nominal anchor and has overseen good economic performance, including keeping the real
exchange rate broadly in equilibrium.
34.
Fiscal and prudential policies will need to be recalibrated if shocks hit the economy. If
downside risks materialize, automatic stabilizers and targeted fiscal stimulus could be used to shore up
growth. To ease any significant financial strains, liquidity and capital support could temporarily be made
available to banks. In the event of a severe property downturn, countercyclical measures enacted in
recent years could also be cautiously unwound, without undermining prudent management of financial
and systemic risks.
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA—MACAO SAR

35.
Financial stability has been bolstered in recent years, and attention must now be focused
on strengthening the resilience of the banking system to potential risks from the gaming and
property sectors, as well as from cross-border financial spillovers. Progress in implementing the
2011 FSAP recommendations and further strengthening the AML/CFT framework is welcome, and
remaining work should be expedited. Prudential measures to manage credit and liquidity risks from a
gaming slowdown and the property sector are particularly important. Banks are in a relatively strong
position and the supervisory framework is sound. To further mitigate these risks and identify potential
weak points, industry-wide stress testing and dynamic provisioning should be established. Given
significant lending to the Mainland, Hong Kong SAR, and Portugal, it will also be important to manage
spillovers from potential shocks in these jurisdictions. To identify emerging risks, the AMCM should
stress test and closely monitor banks’ foreign exposures, including through closer cooperation with
home supervisors and an assessment of financial stability developments in those jurisdictions. Publicizing
more details about the nature of these exposures would also be useful.
36.
To ensure that public finances remain on a sound footing in the coming years, a
medium-term budget framework and sovereign wealth fund could be useful. Looking ahead,
Macao SAR’s public finances confront a likely slowdown in gaming revenues and a rise in spending
needs from population aging. To help secure sustainability, promote transparency and ensure that
growth in spending is consistent with development and fiscal objectives, a medium-term budget
framework could be useful. In addition, the authorities are appropriately devoting more attention to the
sound management of the territory’s fiscal reserves. In this context, consideration could also be given to
allocating some part of the reserves to a sovereign wealth fund with a clear mandate to achieve better
risk-adjusted returns over a long-term horizon, including through a more diversified asset allocation
strategy. As in some other countries, such a fund could continue to be managed by the AMCM, with the
help of external managers for parts of the portfolio.
37.
Over the longer term, diversification will help provide an additional growth engine and
bolster the economy’s resilience. Growth could slow over time as the gaming matures and faces
greater competition from other jurisdictions. The economy’s narrow concentration would also leave
Macao SAR susceptible to external shocks. Therefore, diversification—particularly into nongaming
services—will be key for stable growth over the long term. The authorities are taking several important
steps in this regard and there is scope for exploring further opportunities, including through broader
integration with the Mainland, financial development, and public investments in infrastructure and
human capital.

Box 1. Is There a Housing Bubble in Macao SAR?
Macao SAR’s property price growth path has
been steeper than in a number of regional and
international comparators. Between 2008 and
2013 alone residential property prices more than
tripled, while household disposable income is
estimated to have increased by about 1.5 times.
As discussed below, two empirical approaches
were used to relate residential property prices in
Macao SAR to a set of fundamentals.

By this measure, house prices in Macao SAR may currently be above the benchmark.

Box 2. Macroprudential Policies: What Can Asian Experiences Imply for Macao SAR?
Macroprudential policy measures (MPPs) are aimed at promoting systemic financial stability by
constraining the incentives for excessive risk-taking. They are usually classified into three types: credit-related
(e.g., caps on the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio), liquidity-related (e.g., reserve requirements), and capital-related
(e.g., countercyclical/time-varying capital requirements). Their objective is to limit the risk of widespread disruptions to
the provision of financial services and thereby minimize the impact of such disruptions on the wider economy. The focus is
on the financial system as a whole as opposed to individual components.
Asian countries stand out globally as heavy users of MPPs in recent years, with the bulk of measures focused on
stability risks arising from overheating property markets. In particular, LTV caps for mortgage loans and
debt-to-income limits have been used in China, Hong Kong SAR, India, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, and
Thailand, often together with other real estate lending restrictions and real estate taxes. To address broader-based
banking system risks, several economies have also imposed capital measures (Australia), and tightened provisioning rules
(India and Sri Lanka), and reserve requirements (China, India, and Sri Lanka).
The choice of instruments depends on country circumstances—notably the degree of economic and financial
development, the exchange rate regime, vulnerability to certain shocks, and accompanying macroeconomic policies. For
instances, countries with fixed or managed exchange rates tend to use these tools more since the exchange rate
arrangement limits the room for conventional interest rate policy.
Among the various macroprudential measures, housing-related instruments have generally had a tangible
impact—particularly caps on LTV ratios and the taxation of housing transactions. In particular, such instruments have
helped lower credit growth, slow house price inflation and dampen bank leverage in Asia (April 2014 Asia and Pacific
Regional Economic Outlook).
Policymakers in Macao SAR have also used some policy tools explicitly focused on system-wide risks.
Macroprudential guidelines on mortgage lending were established in December 2010, including lower caps on LTV and
debt service ratios. Their coverage was extended and a special stamp duty (10–20 percent) imposed in April 2011 and the
LTV ratio recommended in the guideline further tightened in October 2012, especially for nonresidents. More recent
macroprudential measures include curbs on developer presales, an extension of the special stamp duty to commercial
properties and parking spaces, and an additional stamp duty (10 percent) on corporate and nonresident buyers.
These measures helped to somewhat cool the local property market. The market moderated in the first quarter of
2013 and trading activity shrank visibly in the third quarter both on a quarterly and yearly basis. Transactions by
nonresidents contracted relatively more sharply, and the LTV ratio witnessed gradual declines. Nevertheless, prices have
continued to trend up.
Given the ongoing withdrawal of UMP, policymakers could at some point reconsider these measures to prevent
excessive deleveraging in the downward phase of the financial cycle, particularly if it coincides with a weak phase of
the economic cycle. Preserving financial stability should be the primary criterion in deciding whether to unwind countercyclical prudential measures. Timely easing of MPPs may reduce the likelihood of, and damage from, credit or house price
collapses. On the other hand, easing regulation as the economy enters a downturn could lower resilience and jeopardize
financial stability going forward. Ultimately, the scope for rolling back will depend on the severity of the financial cycle
downswing, the soundness of bank and borrower balance sheets, and the specific MPPs in place. In the case of housingrelated tools, the case is stronger if there is adequate capacity for servicing household debt, taking into account likely
mortgage rate normalization in the medium term.

Box 3. Progress on Key Recommendations of 2011 FSAP Assessment
Main Recommendations

Steps Taken

1. Grant operational independence to AMCM, including
appointment terms of Chairman, independence over budget, and
final decision making authority in implementing corrective or
remedial action to assure timely and effective bank resolution.

These issues require major legislative changes and an overhaul of
the administrative structure of the Macao SAR Government.
Currently, the FSA is under review for any necessary revisions to
cope with the continuous healthy development of the financial
market and the relevant international supervisory standards. In
the review, areas in relation to the final decision-making
authority in granting and revocation of licenses, and
implementing corrective or remedial actions to assure timely and
effective bank resolution will be considered.

2. Give AMCM authority over key regulatory and supervisory
decision affecting the insurance system, including the licensing
approval process, the regulation of tariffs and sanctions.

Background and authorities' views. The Financial System Act (FSA)
and the Charter of the AMCM (Decree Law No. 14/96/M)
authorize the AMCM with power of supervision over banks,
including the ability to inspect banks, assess applications for
licenses, establish regulatory rules, sanction banks, etc.
Operationally, the AMCM makes its own decisions on all
regulatory and supervisory matters that fall within its scope of
statutory competence. For those matters that the AMCM gives
advice to the Macao SAR Chief Executive, like proposing
corrective actions in the event of banking problems or sanctions
for contraventions, the track record indicates that the Chief
Executive has been in favor of the AMCM and that no regulatory
or supervisory action has been delayed.

3. Complete the onsite inspection manual for banking.

Onsite inspection manual has been completed. New areas of
focus have been added as the banking industry has developed.

4. Amend regulations on related parties to include a guideline
that exposures to related parties may not be granted on more
favorable terms than to nonrelated parties.

The on-going review of the FSA is considering this issue. The
authorities note that this is de facto a standing practice adopted
by Macao SAR banks.

5. Enhance offsite analysis of AMCM by deepening the trend
analysis for individual banks (including financial condition of the
parent) and collate this information into a systemic risk framework
for analyzing overall banking vulnerabilities. The Banking
Supervision Department should modify its banks returns for credit
risk analysis purposes as it would benefit from greater detail
collected on outstanding loans.

Credit risk returns have been revised, and offsite analysis has
been enhanced by reinforcing the trend analysis for individual
banks. Furthermore, good communication with their parent
financial institutions and participation in supervisory colleges
organized by home supervisors has strengthened these areas.

6. Develop a formal process that underpins the current bank
resolution measures in place, including defining possible remedial
actions at trigger points. Specify under what conditions liquidity
will be provided by the AMCM and the role of the government in
the event of possible deposit payout.
7. On insurance supervision, carry out full scale onsite inspection
and develop onsite inspection manual. Offsite supervision should
incorporate an analysis of claims performance and trends.

The on-going review of the FSA is considering this issue.

AMCM completed the “On-site Examination Procedures Manual
for the Insurers” in mid-2013 and since 2009, examiners from the
Insurance Supervision Department have attended periodical
trainings relating to on-site and off-site supervision topics
(organized by the International Association of Insurance
Supervisors (IAIS) and others). Findings of the on-site inspections
were communicated to the insurers concerned, and follow-up
actions taken by the insurers were continuously monitored.
Relating to the analysis of claims performance of nonlife insurers,
the AMCM has developed a framework to collect the ‘claims
triangle for nonlife insurers relating to the major classes of
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA—MACAO SAR
insurance’ and such data shall be collected annually from locally
incorporated insurers starting from 2014. These data shall enable
the AMCM to analyze the claims performance and trends in its
off-site supervisory regime.
8. AMCM should arrange MOUs with the insurance regulators in
the jurisdictions where no such arrangement exists.

Since 2009, three new MOUs have been signed with overseas
insurance regulators, bringing total MOUs to 12. Also, in line with
the initiatives of the IAIS to enhance information exchange and
cooperation among its members, the AMCM signed a MOU with
the IAIS in 2011.

9. To enhance transparency and credibility of accounting system,
adopt the IFRS system in full.

Macao SAR has selectively adopted individual IFRSs into its
accounting framework as Macao Accounting Standards (MASs),
which became compulsory after January 2007. The Macao SAR
Government plans for a full adoption of the IFRS and the
relevant works are in progress. To date, Macao SAR has adopted
1 IFRS and 15 IASs.

10. Consider introduction of a deposit insurance scheme.

The Deposit Protection Scheme was officially launched in
October 2012, with the compensation limit set at
MOP500,000 per depositor per bank.

Box 4. How Vulnerable is Macao SAR to Financial Spillovers?
Network analysis is used to identify systemically important banking systems for the domestic banking
sector in an economy. Based on the methodology of Espinosa-Vega and Sole (2011), it assumes extreme tail
risks, that is, the failure of the banking system of a country, in tracking the contagion paths of hypothetical
shocks across countries in the global banking network. It exploits data on cross-border claims and
economy-specific measures of banking system resilience.
The analysis models the domino effects of two types of shocks: a credit shock triggered by the default of a
banking system’s interbank obligations, and a funding shock triggered by the distress of a banking system that
leads to a liquidity squeeze and associated fire sale losses in countries dependent on funding from the
distressed system.
Despite its extreme assumptions, network analysis is useful in ranking risks from different banking
systems and identifying channels of potential spillovers. The analysis considers scenarios that allow for
interbank exposures. The analysis performed for Macao SAR banks includes 27 banking systems, using BIS data
on cross-border interbank exposures.1 For the credit shock, a loss given default rate of 80 percent is assumed.
For the funding shock, 35 percent of the lost funding is assumed to be irreplaceable and a loss of 80 percent
from fire sales is assumed. The results suggest that:



Credit shocks from the Mainland, Hong Kong SAR, and Portugal represent by far the three biggest
potential risks for the Macao SAR banking system. This is not surprising given the rapid expansion in
Macao SAR banks’ exposure to these three jurisdictions. Australia represents another tier of risk to the
Macao SAR banking system.



Compared with a credit shock, the potential capital loss from a funding shock is smaller, reflecting
Macao SAR banks’ relatively limited dependence on offshore funding. Nevertheless, Hong Kong SAR and
Mainland China represent the biggest risks from a funding shock.

Network analysis can also be used to estimate the outward spillovers of a credit or funding shock
originating in Macao SAR. Similar to the case of inward spillovers, the impact of a credit shock is larger than
that of a funding shock. For credit shocks originating in Macao SAR, the impact seems greatest on Hong Kong
SAR. For funding shocks originating in Macao SAR, the impact would be largest for Portugal, followed by Hong
Kong SAR.
Several policy implications can be drawn from this analysis:



Cross-border collaboration—especially with Mainland China, Hong Kong SAR, and Portugal
supervisors—is important. Due to large exposures and potential spillover risks detected in our analysis,
continued close collaboration with Mainland, Hong Kong SAR, and Portuguese supervisors would be
especially useful. Collaboration with Australia is also important.



Ensuring financial stability in Macao SAR will require continued careful surveillance of potential
vulnerabilities overseas, especially in the Mainland and Hong Kong SAR. Financial spillover risks from
Chinese and Hong Kong banks are already large, and are likely to increase as Macao SAR banks expand in
this region.

–––––––––––––

Bilateral exposure data come from the BIS consolidated banking statistics and are available as of end-September
2013 (Table 9D of BIS statistics) except for three countries—China, Korea, and New Zealand, who do not report consolidated
banking statistics to the BIS. Their exposures are inferred from the foreign claims and liabilities of other countries. Data on
banking sector capital are obtained mainly from IMF’s Financial Soundness Indicators database (www.fsi.org) and country
authorities. A consistent definition of capital (Tier I) is used, as of end-September 2013 or latest available data.

Box 5. External Sector Assessment
Staff assesses Macao SAR’s external position to be broadly consistent with medium-term fundamentals and desirable
policies. This finding is supported by empirical estimates of the real exchange rate, as well as consideration of the
balance of payments and the dynamics of its net foreign assets position.
International asset position and foreign reserves. Macao SAR has significant net foreign assets of around
170 percent of GDP. External sector sustainability is likely to be maintained owing to the persistent balance of
payments surplus over the medium term. As in other financial centers, Macao SAR has large gross external financial
assets (over two times GDP) and liabilities (around the same size as GDP). A slight valuation change could affect
NFA levels without hampering external sustainability. At the same time, Macao SAR has built up reserves (around
30 percent of GDP) in a nondiscretionary manner through the operation of the currency board. This build-up also
helps provide cover against volatile shocks, to which the economy is highly vulnerable due to its openness and
narrow base. In addition, the government has fiscal reserves of about 60 percent of GDP, sufficient to cover
50 months of public spending. Part of the fiscal reserves could be set aside for meeting future spending needs.
Real exchange rate. The REER appreciated by

surprising because financial centers are more
prone to valuation changes, given their large gross external asset and liabilities positions. Based on these
considerations, the real exchange rate is assessed to be broadly consistent with medium-term fundamentals and
desirable policies.
Balance of payments flows.


Current account. The current account surplus briefly fell below 20 percent of GDP on income repatriation and
a drop in tourist arrivals following the global financial crisis but has since recovered to around 44 percent of
GDP, reflecting strong gaming exports. As the gaming sector slows to a more sustainable pace and domestic
demand continues to grow, the current account surplus is expected to moderate toward 35 percent of GDP.
The merchandise trade deficit should rise and the income balance remain in deficit, reflecting the strong profits
of (nonresident) casino operators.



Capital and financial accounts. As a small open economy and offshore center, gross inflows and outflows
are large relative to the economy (at over 15 and 50 percent of GDP, respectively). However, Macao SAR is a
large net exporter of capital and has not experienced major non-FDI capital inflows, owing to the persistent
surplus position of the public and private sectors and lack of domestic money or capital market instruments.
Macao SAR’s strong financial institutions, together with robust regulation and supervision, help contain risks
from capital flows. As a result, Macao SAR has been able to maintain external sustainability with a fully open
capital account and its currency board regime.

Box 6. Sovereign Wealth Funds: What Could International Experience Imply
for Macao SAR?
Over the past decade, Macao SAR has experienced a rapid accumulation of foreign exchange and fiscal reserves.
This reserves buildup, its sources, and future outlook raise important policy questions in terms of making
appropriate investment decisions that are in line with Macao SAR’s macroeconomic goals.
Sovereign Wealth Funds: International Experiences
International experiences show that foreign exchange and fiscal reserves are most often managed in
two major ways. One option is to manage reserves on the central bank balance sheet with a long-term
perspective. Often reserves are split into tranches, such as a liquidity tranche and an investment tranche, and
the latter could be amplified and its mandate expanded to a longer horizon. For instance, the Hong Kong
Monetary Authority separates foreign reserves into two portfolios, the Backing Portfolio and the Investment
Portfolio. Another option is to set up Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWFs), which are special-purpose investment
funds or arrangements that are owned by the general government for macroeconomic purposes. SWFs hold,
manage, or administer assets to achieve financial objectives, and employ a set of investment strategies that
include investing in foreign financial assets.
SWFs have been created by governments for different objectives. Five types of SWFs can be broadly
distinguished based on their main objective: (i) stabilization funds, where the primary objective is to insulate
the budget and the economy against commodity (usually oil) price swings; (ii) savings funds for future
generations, which aim to set aside funds for the future needs of the economy, or of specific groups such as
pensioners, or for future generations; (iii) reserve investment corporations, whose assets are often still counted
as reserve assets, and are established to improve the potential return; (iv) development funds, which typically
help fund socioeconomic projects or promote industrial policies that might raise a country's potential output
growth; and (v) pension reserve funds, which provide (from sources other than individual pension contributions)
for contingent pension liabilities on the government's balance sheet.
The asset allocation of SWFs varies widely depending on many factors, such as the objectives, type,
investment horizon, funding source, and asset-liability management framework. For instance, stabilization
funds should generally have conservative asset allocation, using shorter investment horizons and low
risk-return profiles. By contrast, saving funds may seek to maximize return by having longer investment
horizons and riskier investment strategies, and pension reserve funds can derive their investment horizons
from the timing of the future anticipated liabilities falling due, which can be decades in the future.
SWFs may diversify their asset across two spectra: asset class and geography. Assets can be diversified to
four classes: cash, fixed income, equities, and alternative assets. On average, SWFs tend to have a portfolio with
a split of about 45:25:30 between equities, bonds, and alternative assets. Geographically, SWFs gradually have
begun to shift assets away from investments in industrial economies and toward those in emerging economies.
A variety of institutional arrangements are possible for SWFs. SWFs could be established simply as central
government accounts managed by the central bank (as in Norway and Kazakhstan), or as agencies managing
international reserves under the government’s direction (Government of Singapore Investment Corporation,
Korea Investment Corporation), or set up as separate public entities (Temasek in Singapore, Kuwait Investment
Authority). Regardless of the institutional arrangements, the operational management of the SWFs should be
conducted on an independent basis to minimize potential political influence or interference that could hinder
the achievement of its objectives.
Implications for Macao SAR
Supported by a growing service-trade surplus associated with the gaming boom, Macao SAR has
rapidly accumulated international and fiscal reserves over the past decade. By 2011, Macao SAR’s foreign
exchange reserves reached US$ 34 billion, equivalent to over 90 percent of GDP. In 2012, Macao SAR adopted

24

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA—MACAO SAR

Box 6. Sovereign Wealth Funds: What Could International Experience Imply
for Macao SAR? (concluded)
the fiscal reserve law and transferred some international reserves to fiscal reserves, which reached
US$30 billion as of January 2014, or nearly 60 percent of GDP. Fiscal reserves are split into a basic reserve and
excess reserves, with the former meant as a buffer to cover 18 months of central government expenditure and
the latter’s mandate being expanded to a longer horizon.
The foreign exchange and fiscal reserves have achieved a relatively good return since the handover.
During 1999-2013, the average return of the Macao SAR foreign reserve and reserve funds has been higher
than Macao SAR’s inflation and the average inflation in the United States, euro area and Hong Kong SAR.
Illustrating the trade-off between risk and yield, returns since the onset of the global crisis in 2008 have been
less volatile but, at annual average of 1½ percent, somewhat lower than for a number of sovereign wealth
funds worldwide. To further improve reserves management, the AMCM has taken a more proactive approach
to investing fiscal reserves. The AMCM introduced more investment vehicles and diversified asset allocations,
such as holding RMB bonds and obtaining Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (QFII) status for investment
in the Mainland. Since this year, the AMCM has decided to invest around 10 percent of the fiscal reserves in
equities by exploring further investment opportunities in the Mainland and overseas equity markets,
diversifying asset allocations, and optimizing the portfolio weights to increase the medium- and long-term
investment return.
Looking ahead, the ongoing reserves accumulation, increasing aging-related expenditures and the
possibility of a prolonged period of low global real interest rates may impose more pressure to improve
investment return. First, further accumulation of fiscal reserves, along with the gaming boom, would
necessitate more effective management of the incoming resources. Second, increasing aging-related
expenditures creates a need to secure future welfare or finance the future obligations. Third, according to IMF
staff research in the April 2014 World Economic Outlook, global real interest rates could stay low in the medium
term, which would place a further premium on undertaking a prudent search for yield.
In this context, one option may be to assign a portion of the excess fiscal reserves to a SWF, which
could continue to be managed by the AMCM. Setting up a SWF with a clear mandate to improve
risk-adjusted returns over a long horizon, subject to a well-defined tolerance for risk, would help to better
smooth intertemporal consumption and redistribute wealth across generations. The long-term investment
horizon should help diversify strategic asset allocations and achieve higher risk-adjusted returns over the
medium term, albeit at the cost of periods of short-term volatility. In the case of Macao SAR, it may be more
cost-efficient to have such a fund managed by the AMCM. This institutional arrangement would not impact the
AMCM’s income and balance sheet, and could make use of existing infrastructure and human resources,
including experience in hiring and monitoring external managers.
Operation, accountability, and reporting lines should be clear and consistent with international best
practice, as outlined in the “Santiago Principles.” Regardless of the institutional arrangements, operational
independence should be embedded in a clear legal foundation and internal governance structure, where the
decision making framework and oversight function are clear and the relationship between the principal (owner)
and its agent is well established. Moreover, timely and accurate reporting of investment activities to the owner
helps ensure that the operation is integrated into the macroeconomic policy making process with full
accountability and transparency.

Nature of Threat

Likelihood

Impact

Recommended Policy Response

Surges in global financial market volatility
related to UMP exit

High

Medium. Macao SAR has not experienced a surge in non-FDI capital inflows since the onset of the
crisis, owing to the persistent surplus position of the public and private sectors and lack of domestic
money or capital market instruments. It runs a sizeable balance of payments surplus. Nevertheless,
domestic interest rates and the real effective exchange rate could rise sharply, mirroring
developments in the United States. This could in turn slow domestic activity and tourism, resulting
in capital outflows that further tighten monetary conditions, straining household debt servicing
capacity (and perhaps precipitating a property downturn, see below).

If growth falters, allow automatic stabilizers full play and deploy fiscal stimulus to support domestic demand while
helping to shield low-income and vulnerable households. Options include targeted tax relief and increased
transfers to households, support for SMEs, and accelerated public infrastructure (including housing).
Ensure regulatory and supervision standards and risk management practices remain sound. To ease any significant
financial strains, liquidity and capital support could temporarily be made available to banks. Having a rapid
remedial framework for an orderly approach to resolving bank problems in place ahead of time would strengthen
the financial safety net.

Protracted slow growth in advanced
economies (due to deleveraging) and
emerging economies (due to incomplete
structural reforms)

Medium

High. As a small, open economy that relies heavily on tourism, Macao SAR would be heavily
impacted, both in terms of growth and fiscal revenue.

Support domestic demand, provide liquidity/capital support to banks as needed, and diversify the economy by
judiciously using fiscal reserves without jeopardizing sustainability, including through increased spending on
infrastructure, education, and health as well as support for SMEs.

Sharp slowdown in the Mainland or Hong
Kong SAR over the medium-term

Medium

High. Trade, FDI and financial linkages with both jurisdictions are high. Tourism would plummet,
gaming revenue dwindle and bank balance sheets suffer both because of lending to these
jurisdictions and the knock-on impact of slower growth on domestic loans (although most benefit
from support of their parent banks abroad).

Monitor risks in these jurisdictions through increased communication with home supervisors. Shore up domestic
demand through automatic stabilizers and fiscal stimulus (as above) while accelerating policies to diversify the
economy toward other sectors and territories, including through judicious use of fiscal reserves.

Disorderly correction of housing prices

Medium

High. Prices have risen sharply through the global crisis, buoyed by low interest rates and strong
income growth, but there are signs of over-valuation. A reversal in these factors could trigger a
correction in prices, straining bank balance sheets―given high exposure to property (a third of total
loans)―and triggering negative feedback loops through adverse wealth effects.

In the absence of associated systemic risks, cautiously unwind countervailing macroprudential measures
implemented in recent years—including by raising caps on LTV and debt service ratios, and reducing stamp
duties. Support the construction industry by building more public housing and boost demand by selectively
easing purchase restrictions (including on foreigners). Ensure adequate supply of land and public housing in the
medium-term.

Policy changes in Mainland China or
regulatory weaknesses in Macao SAR that
reduce flow of tourists

Low

High. Changes to Mainland visa policies or remaining weaknesses in the AML/CFT regime could
Improve the AML/CFT measures in the gaming sector, in particular with respect to customer due diligence and

economy.

Medium

Low. Direct trade and financial linkages with Russia and Ukraine are low. To the extent that global
commodity prices rise as a result, Macao SAR, which is almost exclusively externally dependent for
its food and energy supplies, could be hit, both through higher imported inflation and a
deterioration in terms of trade. However, the service-based nature of the economy would limit the
damage. Effects could be larger if they spill over to major advanced economies, the Mainland or
Hong Kong SAR.

If growth falls significantly due to spillovers to major trading and financial partners, use automatic stabilizers and
deploy targeted fiscal stimulus. If property sector also falters, judiciously unwind macroprudential measures.

Successful implementation of reforms to
rebalance the economy in the Mainland over
the medium term

Medium

High. This would support gaming revenues as household incomes in the Mainland continue to
grow, and also provide opportunities for diversification toward other services that consumers in a
rebalanced and more open Mainland would demand (including education, health, recreation,
financial, legal, accounting, and environmental).

Position Macao SAR to take advantage of the Mainland's transition by undertaking reforms and public investment
to enhance human capital, upgrade infrastructure, and make resources and financing available to new sectors.

Las Vegas Strip, Nev.

As the world’s biggest gaming market by
revenue, the economy of Macao SAR is
heavily reliant on the gaming industry.
Gaming revenue in 2013 rose by nearly
19 percent to MOP 360.7 billion or 87 percent
of GDP, around seven times larger than in Las
Vegas. The tax collected from the gaming
sector in 2012 accounted for 83 percent of total
government revenue.

Macao SAR’s gaming boom started with the

end of a 40-year monopoly in 2002. The
government undertook a bidding process for gaming concessions, which were granted to one local
incumbent and five new gaming operators (all foreign-owned or with foreign partners): SJM
Holdings, Galaxy, Sands, Wynn, MGM and Melco Crown. Today, Macao SAR has 35 casinos,
5,750 gaming tables and around 13,106 slot machines. The only part of China where gaming is legal,
almost 87percent of the clientele originates from the Mainland and Hong Kong SAR.
Gaming companies pay a special gaming tax equivalent to 35 percent of their gross revenue.
In addition, they also pay 1.6 percent of gross revenue to the Macao Foundation for social, cultural,
and economic development, and 1.4 to 2.4 percent of gross revenue for the development of urban
construction, tourism, and the Social Security Fund.
Their profits rely heavily on gaming activities. Nongaming activities only contribute about
10 percent of total revenue, significantly lower than casinos in other jurisdictions. This can be
attributed to the business model of casinos in Macao SAR that relies on operation of VIP rooms
targeting high roller customers and involving junket promoters, who can lend to and gamble with
customers directly. Furthermore, junket promoters could be associated with a dense network of
collaborators or agents located in and outside Macao SAR, which adds to the challenge of
overseeing their activities. Although the Individual Traveler Scheme introduced by the Mainland
government in 2003 helped boost the mass market, the VIP or significant players continues to
contribute around two-thirds of total revenues.
The authorities are looking to encourage more nongaming elements. Responding to concerns
about the economy’s reliance on gaming and the lack of alternative employment options for Macao
SAR residents, the authorities have required the concessionaires to devote most of their property to
nongaming segments such as restaurants, hotels, retail and event space in the context of the midterm review of the effective concessions, which will expire in 2020-2022.

Appendix III. External Sector Debt Sustainability Analysis
Macao SAR has no public debt. All of the economy’s external debt is private, with the majority of loans
undertaken by the gaming industry. At 102 percent of GDP, external debt is around two-fifths of gross
foreign assets. It is expected to remain sustainable given the moderate expected increase in interest rate
costs as global rates normalize and the continued strong growth of the tourism industry. Under the
baseline scenario, external debt is expected to decline to around 70 percent of GDP by 2019, close to
pre-crisis levels. Even under the most stressed scenarios, external debt would remain on a downward
trajectory or—under the growth shock and combined shock scenarios—remain relatively unchanged as a
share of GDP over the forecast horizon.
Under the baseline scenario, external debt is expected to decline steadily over the medium
term. Owing to the boom in the gaming sector, Macao SAR’s external debt—all of which is private—
reached 102 percent of GDP in 2013. External debt financing grew in the aftermath of the
liberalization of the gaming industry. About three-fourths of total external loans are related to
gaming, with the remaining portion

about 70 percent of GDP by 2019.

1

The projected improvement in external debt is primarily attributable to Macao SAR’s large current
account surpluses, and holds even under stress scenarios. Macao SAR faces favorable prospects, as
the global recovery is expected to strengthen the demand for its service exports. Several expansion
projects are planned for 2015–17 by the hotel and entertainment industries, which are likely to generate
additional debt liabilities. However, given land and labor supply constraints in the tourism sector, private
gross fixed capital formation along with new debt accumulation is expected to decline by 2019. Despite
the expected moderation of the current account surplus, it should continue to remain well above 30
percent of GDP. The economy also maintains large gross foreign assets, whose build-up partly explains
the residuals in Table 1. Thus, amid continued current account surpluses, large fiscal and foreign reserve
accumulation, and a slowing number of expansion projects undertaken by the tourism industry, external
debt is likely to follow a downward trajectory. Even under the most stressed scenarios, debt would fall
or—under the growth shock and combined shock scenarios—remain relatively unchanged as a share of
GDP over the forecast horizon.

FUND RELATIONS
Membership Status
As a Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China, Macao SAR is not a member of the
Fund. The only previous Article IV consultation discussions were concluded on March 25, 1999 before
the territory’s handover from Portugal to China at the end of that year. However, the Fund has
maintained a relationship with Macao SAR, focused mainly on technical assistance and training. STA
provided technical assistance with compiling FSIs in 2013 and on the balance of payments in 2008,
MCM completed an FSAP in 2011, and LEG provided advice on AML/CFT issues resulting in new
legislation in 2006.
Exchange Rate Arrangement
Since 1989, Macao SAR has been operating under a currency board arrangement. On April 7, 1977,
the exchange rate of Macao SAR’s currency, the pataca, was formally delinked from the Portuguese
escudo and linked to the Hong Kong dollar at a central rate of MOP 1.075/HK$, and the transaction
rates were allowed to deviate from this rate as long as they were within a band of +/-1 percent of
the central rate. Effective January 1979, the central rate of the pataca was set at MOP 1.038/HK$, and
in September 1983, was adjusted to MOP 1.03/HK$, and the transaction rates were to take place
within a narrow band on either side of the central rate. This arrangement continued through May
1987.
Since then, the pataca has been tied to the Hong Kong dollar at a rate of MOP1.03/HK$, and is
therefore also in effect linked to the US$, at around MOP8/US$. Notes are issued by two banks,
which deliver Hong Kong dollars to the AMCM in return for noninterest bearing certificates of
indebtedness, which serve as the backing for the banknote issue. The Hong Kong dollars are then
counted as part of the official foreign exchange reserves held at the AMCM. Under the currency
board arrangement, the pataca is 100 percent backed by foreign assets. There are no exchange
restrictions on current and capital account transactions. With capital freely mobile, monetary
conditions in MSAR are strongly influenced by conditions in Hong Kong SAR and the United States
market.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision is adequate for surveillance purposes. Macao SAR has been participating in the IMF’s
General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) since August 2007.
National accounts. Macao SAR compiles quarterly and annual estimates of GDP by expenditure
category, at current prices and in volume terms. The volume measures are derived using annual
chain linking methods. The estimates by type of activity are compiled in current prices only, due to
the unavailability of relevant deflators. A major revision of the compilation process was undertaken
in 2010. The key changes include the adoption of chain linking to derive volume estimates and the
introduction of data from the 2007/08 household income and expenditure survey to estimate
private final consumption expenditure. Macao SAR reports annual and quarterly GDP to the IMF for
publication in International Financial Statistics (IFS). STA has not provided technical assistance in
national accounts to Macao SAR over the past ten years.
Price statistics. Macao SAR compiles a monthly consumer price index (CPI) with a base period of
April 2008 to March 2009. The index is rebased every five years and has been available since
October 2009. The weights were derived from the 2007/08 household income and expenditure
survey. Macao SAR releases a composite CPI, which reflects price changes for the general population
of households, CPI-A that covers households with an average monthly expenditure of MOP 6,000 to
MOP 18,999 (about 50 percent of households), and a CPI-B that covers households with an average
monthly expenditure of MOP 19,000 to MOP 34,999 (about 30 percent of households). Macao SAR
submits CPI data to the IMF for publication in IFS.
Government finance statistics. Macao SAR reports detailed annual consolidated general
government accounts (budget, 39 extra budgetary units, and one social security fund) in the GFSM
2001 format for inclusion in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook, along with summary
quarterly general government accounts for publication in IFS. These data could be usefully
augmented by the reporting of a financial balance sheet, as outlined in the 2010 Board decision
regarding government finance statistics to strengthen fiscal analysis.
Monetary and financial statistics. The Monetary Authority of Macao (AMCM) reports, on a timely
basis, monthly monetary data to STA for publication in IFS. These data are reported in the format of
the Standardized Report Forms (SRFs) for central bank (1SR) and other depository corporations
(2SR), monetary aggregates (5SR) and interest rates and share prices (6SR), which embody the
IMF-recommended methodology for compiling monetary statistics.
Financial sector surveillance. In the area of financial soundness indicators (FSIs), the AMCM has
compiled selected time series of FSIs, which are published in its semi-annual publication Monetary
and Financial Stability Review. A statistics mission on FSIs visited AMCM in July 2013 and assisted
the authorities in establishing procedures for compiling FSIs in accordance with the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

3

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA—MACAO SAR

IMF-recommended framework. The authorities have, since May 2014, regularly reported FSIs to STA
for dissemination on the IMF website.
External sector statistics. The AMCM compiles and disseminates annual balance of payments
(BOP) statistics. IIP statistics are not available. Since 2012, the BOP of Macao SAR has been compiled
following the methodology and classification of the sixth edition of the Balance of Payments and
International Investment Position Manual (BPM6). BOP data for 2002–11 were originally compiled
under the format of the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5) and converted to
the BPM6 format. Although, external sector statistics are not yet compiled on a quarterly basis,
Macao SAR participates in major Fund Statistical Initiatives, such as the General Data Dissemination
System (GDDS), the Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS), and the Coordinated Direct
Investment Survey (CDIS). Direct investment abroad by Macao SAR household sector is not covered
in external sector statistics. Household financial investment abroad (portfolio and other investments,
except deposits abroad that can be collected from the BIS data) only covers those transactions
going through local authorized financial institutions, and hence, transactions outside the local
financial channel are not recorded. In addition, compensation of Macao SAR employees earned
abroad is not covered in the BOP. Due to the implementation of the BPM6 methodology in 2012,
personal effects, financial assets, and liabilities of persons changing residence are no longer covered
by a capital transfer in the capital account.

Press Release No. 14/360
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
July 24, 2014

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with the People’s Republic of
China––Macao Special Administrative Region
On July 16, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the Article
IV Consultation1 with Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR). The Consultation took place for the
first time since the handover of Macao SAR from Portugal to China in 1999.
Prudent macroeconomic management has underpinned rapid development in the territory, which is now
the world’s largest gaming center and has one of the highest levels of per capita GDP in the world. The
policy framework—anchored by the combination of a currency board pegged to the Hong Kong
dollar (and indirectly the U.S. dollar), flexible markets, and a commitment to safeguarding fiscal
discipline and financial stability—has served Macao SAR well in maintaining financial stability and a
strong external position, while successfully weathering several external shocks, including the recent
global crisis. As a small, open and tourism-dependent economy, Macao SAR currently also benefits from
loose global monetary conditions and a Mainland-related boom.
Growth rose to 11.9 percent in 2013 from 9.1 percent the previous year, driven by a pick-up in
gaming exports. This enabled a large fiscal surplus of 23.3 percent of GDP and another current
account surplus estimated at around 44 percent of GDP. Robust activity and historically low
unemployment kept inflation relatively elevated at 5.5 percent. Notwithstanding some measures
taken by the government that have slowed transactions and nonresident inflows, property prices
increased by nearly 40 percent again last year, and credit growth remained brisk, up by over
30 percent. Given limited domestic lending opportunities, banks also continued to increase their
foreign assets. Meanwhile, the health of the banking system strengthened further, with the average
capital adequacy ratio rising to nearly 15 percent and the non-performing loan (NPL) ratio ticking
down to only 0.1 percent.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually

every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with
officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA—MACAO SAR

The outlook is bright. Growth should stay strong over the next few years at 8–10 percent buoyed by
gaming exports and investment, with inflation remaining around 5–5.5 percent. However, Macao SAR
needs to prepare for future shifts in the global and domestic landscape, including implications from
the unwinding of unconventional monetary policy by the United States and the Mainland engaging
in major structural reforms to rebalance its growth.
While Macao SAR may benefit from further developing services demanded by a changing global
environment, the narrow base of the economy makes it susceptible to external shocks, including a
potential slowdown in tourism, due to shocks in the Mainland or Hong Kong SAR, or other setbacks
to the global recovery. The buoyant property market could also come under pressure if demand
fundamentals shift or interest rates rise sharply, due to faster-than-anticipated withdrawal of
unconventional monetary policy abroad or increased financial market volatility in its wake. Credit
risks may also arise from cross-border lending to the Mainland, Hong Kong SAR, and Portugal. Over
a longer horizon, growth could slow as the gaming sector matures and the population ages. As a
result, Macao SAR will need to preserve its traditional strengths by appropriately calibrating
macroeconomic policies while bolstering financial soundness, ensuring external stability, maintaining
fiscal prudence, and diversifying the economy.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended the authorities for their prudent macroeconomic management,
which has lifted living standards to one of the highest levels in the world and enabled Macao SAR to
weather external shocks successfully. Directors noted, however, that, while the outlook remains
strong, the small open economy is susceptible to shocks arising from a narrow economic base,
booming property prices, and a shifting external environment. Accordingly, Directors recommended
persevering with the prudent policies, and welcomed the authorities’ determination to take all
necessary steps to safeguard macroeconomic and financial stability.
Directors welcomed the progress in bolstering financial stability, including by implementing
recommendations from the 2011 Financial Sector Assessment Program and enhancing the regime
against money laundering and the financing of terrorism. They encouraged the authorities to
address the remaining vulnerabilities and to further strengthen the resilience of the banking system
to potential risks, including from the gaming and property sectors as well as from cross-border
financial spillovers. To identify emerging risks, Directors highlighted the importance of industry-wide
stress testing and close cooperation with supervisors in other jurisdictions. Directors welcomed the
authorities’ efforts to manage rising property prices with macroprudential measures and
recommended continued vigilance.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views

of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any
qualifiers used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

Directors took note of the staff’s assessment that the currency board with the Hong Kong dollar link
has worked well for Macao SAR and should be maintained. The system provides a crucial anchor to
expectations and supports economic activity, including by keeping the external position broadly
consistent with medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies.
Directors commended the authorities for their fiscal prudence. To ensure that public finances remain on a
sound footing as the gaming sector matures and the population ages, they recommended the adoption of
a medium-term budget framework. Consideration could also be given to allocating some part of Macao
SAR’s ample fiscal reserves to a sovereign wealth fund with a clear mandate to achieve better risk-adjusted
returns over a long horizon, including through a more diversified asset allocation strategy.
Directors underscored that economic diversification holds the key to unlocking additional growth engines
and achieving greater economic resilience over the longer term. They commended the authorities’ focus
on promoting nongaming services, and encouraged them to explore more opportunities, including
through broader integration with the Mainland, further financial development, and greater public
investments in infrastructure and human capital.

Statement by Tao Zhang
Executive Director for the People’s Republic of China—
Macao Special Administrative Region
July 16, 2014
On behalf of the Macao SAR authorities, I would like to thank staff of the Article IV team for the
candid and constructive dialogue held during the mission, and their thoughtful assessment and
advice. The Macao SAR authorities appreciate this consultation with the Fund, which has been the
first for Macao SAR since its establishment in December 1999. I broadly agree with staff’s assessment
of the economic outlook and macroeconomic policies, and endorse staff’s recommendation to place
Macao SAR on a 24-month Article IV cycle. I am pleased to confirm the authorities’ intention to
publish the staff report.
Economic development and outlook
Between 1999 and 2013, the Macao SAR economy experienced a compound growth rate of
11.8 percent per annum. The slowest growth rate of 1.7 percent was in 2009 due to the global
financial crisis, but it rebounded strongly with a record-high growth of 27.5 percent in the subsequent
year. This pattern of relatively large swings in growth was shared by some emerging market
economies. Since 2010, the Macao SAR economy has grown strongly and consistently. Real GDP rose
by 11.9 percent in 2013 while nominal GDP per capita reached an all-time high of US$87,306, which
was the fourth highest in the world. In terms of PPP-based per capita GDP, Macao SAR ranked the
second highest in the world, just behind Qatar. A high degree of resilience and sustained growth are
two outstanding features of the Macao SAR economy.
In 2014, continuous growth in both domestic and external demand is expected to underpin a steady
development in economic activities. Gross fixed capital formation would expand faster, driven mainly
by private tourism-related construction projects and public sector infrastructure investment. Net
external demand would grow at a positive-yet-slower pace upon rising visitor arrivals, which reached
29.3 million in 2013. In the medium term, the Macao SAR economy is likely to ride on an
expansionary trend, primarily attributable to new tourism and infrastructure facilities to be established
within the next few years.
The general price level of Macao SAR is rising. The domestic factor has been a major driver of
inflation over the last few years, along with a limited supply of domestic production resources in a
growing economy. The unemployment rate fell to a historical low of 1.8 percent in 2013 from
6.8 percent in 2000, uplifting employment earnings. Foreign workers, which took up 38.2 percent of
employment in 2013, have been playing a major role in alleviating labor shortage. Furthermore, both
prices and rentals of commercial properties have risen at a fast pace. All these factors have pushed
operating costs of local businesses up and swiftly passed onto prices of final products and services in
a buoyant economy. Macao SAR’s consumer price inflation is likely to stay above 5.0 percent for
2014, while the unemployment rate would be below 2.0 percent.

2
Economic diversification
The Macao SAR economy has been mainly driven by exports of tourism services, while the share of
the tertiary sector in GDP has been close to 95.0 percent. The authorities agree with staff’s
assessment that economic diversification is beneficial to Macao SAR as it mitigates the concentration
risk of the economy by nurturing new sources of growth to promote sustainable development.
The authorities have set a policy agenda to develop Macao SAR into a world tourism and leisure
center, aiming at a balanced development in a variety of services. Policy priorities have been given to
accelerate the development of nongaming entertainment, conventions and exhibitions, cultural and
creative businesses, commercial and trade services, and traditional Chinese medicine. The ongoing
rebalancing of the Mainland economy and Macao SAR’s increasing integration with neighboring
economies would help create a demand for these new services, while the continuous liberalization of
China’s capital and financial account would promote the RMB and other financial businesses in
Macao SAR.
Institutional mechanisms have been put in place for regional integration, with a view to capitalizing
on the expanded production capacity and the consistently strong growth in the region. The Mainland
and Macao Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA) and its supplement agreements have
been playing a significant role in creating new opportunities for local businesses. Under the
Framework Agreement on Cooperation between Guangdong and Macao, the Macao SAR authorities
have commenced intensive collaboration with Guangdong province, including further liberalization of
services trade between the two places and joint development of the province’s Hengqin Island.
Taking advantage of Macao SAR’s historical background, the authorities are strengthening Macao
SAR’s unique role as the commercial and trade platform between China and Portuguese-speaking
countries (PSCs). Major initiatives include hosting the Ministerial Conference of the Economic
Cooperation Forum between China and PSCs; providing exchange and training programs for
personnel from PSCs; and establishing a Cooperation and Development Fund for relevant projects
and business transactions.
The authorities agree to staff’s recommendations about nurturing Macao SAR’s comparative
advantages for economic diversification by investment in infrastructure, social sectors, and human
capital, given the consistently large surplus in the fiscal accounts.
Linked exchange rate system and external sustainability
The authorities welcome staff’s strong endorsement for the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) as
the best arrangement for Macao SAR, which is properly managed under a credible currency board
arrangement. The positive assessment by staff on Macao SAR’s fulfillment of the prerequisites for the
LERS would help strengthen public confidence in the LERS and, hence, the monetary stability of
Macao SAR.
The authorities agree with staff’s assessment that Macao SAR has been able to maintain external

3
sustainability with a fully open capital and financial account and exchange rate regime. The current
account surplus is expected to sustain over the medium term with a strong travel account of the
balance of payments. Macao SAR is a net exporter of capital and has not experienced major non-FDI
capital inflows due to the persistent surplus position and lack of domestic money or capital market
instruments. Macao SAR’s real exchange rate is assessed to be broadly in equilibrium, owing to
sufficient price flexibility. It has a strong net foreign assets position for both the public and private
sectors, which serves as an effective buffer against external shocks. Macao SAR’s healthy financial
institutions, together with robust supervision and macroprudential regulation, also help contain risks
from capital flows.
The authorities agree with staff’s analysis of Macao SAR’s external debt sustainability and its
projections, under both baseline and most-stressed scenarios, of a downward trajectory of private
external debts in GDP terms over the medium term.
Fiscal policy and Fiscal Reserve
Fiscal prudence, as stipulated in the Basic Law of the Macao SAR, is the key principle for the Macao
SAR authorities to formulate its fiscal policy. It is also a requirement for a credible LERS. The Macao
SAR authorities have reported fiscal surpluses, on an annual average of 11.5 percent of GDP in its
central account over 2000–2013. The contractionary fiscal stance of the surplus budget, under the
LERS, is deemed as appropriate for the macroeconomic situation of strong growth, relatively high
inflation, and extremely low unemployment.
The balance sheet of the public sector has been strengthening due mainly to a continuous
accumulation in fiscal-related assets and debt-free position. Accumulated fiscal surpluses had been
part of Macao SAR’s foreign exchange reserves. In February 2012, Macao SAR established a
standalone Fiscal Reserve, which solely absorbs surpluses in the public accounts. The Fiscal Reserve,
currently with an asset amount equivalent to about 400.0 percent of total government expenditure of
2013, serves as a strong cushion for future cyclical downturns and financial backup for long-term
fiscal commitments in an aging society.
The Fiscal Reserve, which is now separated from foreign exchange reserves and has its own legal
mandate as specified in the Fiscal Reserve Act, has acquired certain institutional characteristics of a
Sovereign Wealth Fund, as pointed out by staff. The authorities agree to staff’s suggestion to raise
the risk-return profile by adopting a more aggressive investment strategy for a portion of the Fiscal
Reserve that has a longer-term horizon, higher toleration of risk, and a better return target. The size
of the portfolio with a more aggressive investment strategy shall be consistent with the principle of
prudent fiscal management and the legal framework of Macao SAR’s Fiscal Reserve System. The
authorities started to invest in equities through external fund managers in 2014 and would continue
to diversify asset allocation of the Fiscal Reserve with the objective of raising the returns in the long
term and, hence, strengthen the fiscal buffer. The authorities also reckon the importance to work out
the uses and sources of public funds based on the Macao SAR authorities’ medium-term budget

4
projections with allowance for stress scenarios.
Property market
Property prices have sustained their upward trend over the last decade. The rapid growth pace has
been underpinned by strong economic fundamentals, scarce supply of land and housing units, as
well as the loose global monetary condition since 2009. The rise in property prices has been
particularly pronounced in recent years, with the average growth outpacing nominal GDP growth and
employment income growth. The housing affordability has correspondingly deteriorated.
Property-related credit activities remain a significant portion of bank lending, although their growth
has moderated. The share of property-related loans in total private-sector loans dropped to
38.1 percent at end-2013 from 43.5 percent at end-2009. In addition, the asset quality of these loans
holds up well in line with the strong economy. The delinquency ratio of property-related loans edged
down from 0.21 percent at end-2009 to 0.05 percent at end-2013, while the amount of negative
equity and write-off ratios both stayed at negligible levels.
Following the implementation of macroprudential and demand management measures since 2010,
trading activities have shrunk and nonresident buyers have withdrawn from the market with their
share in transactions dropping from over 10.0 percent a few years ago to less than 5.0 percent. On
the supply side, the recent completion of public housing units has helped met the demand for
dwellings of the low-to-middle-income group of Macao SAR residents. The supply of new private
housing units is also expected to pick up in the coming years.
The authorities will stay vigilant of the risk of overvalued properties upon shift in demand
fundamentals and abrupt rise in interest rates. We agree with staff’s recommendations that
adjustments in policy measures should be promptly implemented in response to any significant rise
in downside or upside risks to be observed in the future through close monitoring of market
developments.
Financial sector
While the Macao SAR banking sector is currently in solid health with reference to key financial
soundness indicators, the authorities agree with staff that risks associated with rising property prices
and increasing external exposures of banks to a few jurisdictions would require close and continuous
monitoring, especially against a background of withdrawal of U.S. unconventional monetary policy
and slowdown in emerging market economies in the region.
A sharp correction in the property market is unlikely, given the strong economic fundamentals.
Nevertheless, the authorities will stay vigilant and fine-tune the macroprudential and demandmanagement measures whenever deemed necessary to safeguard financial stability. For risk control
and regulatory compliance, Macao SAR’s banks have conducted stress tests, particularly on mortgage

5
loan portfolios and liquidity under certain crisis scenarios.
With an anticipated exit from unconventional monetary policy in advanced economies, the global
monetary condition would be normalized and interest rates would rise at a gradual pace. It could
bring about a certain impact on Macao SAR banks’ Mainland-related exposure and households’ debtservicing ability for personal lending, including housing loans. However, alongside the developments
of cross-border cooperation and implementation of “going abroad” strategy by the Mainland
authorities, loan portfolios of Macao SAR banks have been increasingly diversified. It is also noted
that some Mainland-related loans are approved by the head offices of Macao SAR banks and, hence,
according to Macao SAR’s regulatory practices, the authorities could request those loans to be
transferred out from the books of local banks, if necessary.
There have not been a significant flow of funds from advanced economies to Macao SAR as a result
of the unconventional monetary policy. However, as the MOP maintains a stable exchange rate
relationship with the U.S. dollar under the LERS, ultra-low U.S. interest rates have created lending
business opportunities for Macao SAR banks. Coupled with a close economic relationship between
the Mainland and Macao SAR, Macao SAR banks, particularly those with Mainland background, have
utilized their close connections with parent/head offices and affiliates, and have expanded their
lending associated with evolving financial and credit environments in the Mainland.
There have been loans granted, mainly trade-orientated, in US$ and RMB for companies referred by
banks’ parent/head offices or affiliates in the Mainland. As part of the ongoing monitoring process,
the authorities conduct regular examinations on banks’ lending policies and risk management
practices to check if loans are granted for real economic purposes, and if the collateral is duly
formalized and enforceable. Any banks with relatively high concentration in Mainland-related loans
will be called upon to diversify its loan portfolios and to reset a more appropriate portfolio-based
limit for Mainland-related exposure. So far, the authorities have not observed any major heightened
risks on this front. For supervisory purposes, the authorities have established internally a three-tier
monitoring system of banks’ capital adequacy ratios to help ensure that Macao SAR banks’ capital
positions are in good shape.
It is expected that the low interest rate environment and strong economic growth will continue to
support lending businesses. For personal credit, the debt-servicing ratio and portfolio-based limit
could be introduced by the authorities if significant risks are observed. Meanwhile, a study on
constructing a database for sharing customer credit data within the banking industry has been
initiated. This could effectively help banks to assess borrowers’ repayment ability, which would be
useful for banks in monitoring and containing their credit risks.
Efforts on anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism
The authorities share staff’s views on the importance of persistent strengthening of the anti-money
laundering (AML) and combating the financing of terrorism (CFT) framework. Macao SAR is assessed

6
to have achieved substantial progress on this front and such efforts are conducive to Macao SAR’s
long-term development. Macao SAR would continue to promote international AML/CFT standards
and requirements through various channels, including legislating laws, drafting and revising
guidelines, participating in international organizations and forums, and organizing training
workshops/meetings for relevant parties.
