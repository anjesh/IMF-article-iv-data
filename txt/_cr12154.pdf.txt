STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
June 4, 2012

KEY ISSUES
Context. Sweden’s recovery from the global crisis has been spectacular but underlying
growth has now slowed sharply, unemployment remains above pre-crisis levels and the
outlook is clouded given weaknesses in European trading partners.
Focus. Discussions centered on the economic policy mix to manage near-term risks and
to buttress the resilience of Sweden’s outsized financial system.
Financial stability. Staff emphasized the importance of, alongside Sweden’s
commendable strive to adopt higher capital requirements than provided under Basel III,
ensuring that supervisors are able to make effective use of "Pillar 2", strengthening
early intervention and resolution powers of the supervisors, assessments (as for capital)
of the adequacy of international liquidity standards for Sweden, extension of resolution
planning to all major banks, and deepening regional supervisory coordination and crisis
management under the Nordic-Baltic arrangements.
Near-term macroeconomic policy mix. Given Sweden’s strong fiscal position
automatic stabilizers are rightly left to operate unimpeded. And given tail risk of large
jumps in public debt, this budget stance also retains appropriately large fiscal buffers.
On the monetary side, policy should continue to be set according to the baseline
scenario, as it can be adjusted rapidly if tail risks are realized. Macroprudential
instruments should be deployed further if the housing market reflates once again.
Medium-term policy frameworks. The framework of fiscal rules targeting 1 percent of
GDP surplus over the cycle and nominal expenditure ceilings remain appropriate.
However the tax structure could be more “growth friendly” and better targeted to
vulnerable groups. The monetary framework also remains credible but could be
improved by greater clarity on the Riksbank’s financial stability mandate as well as
publication of market-rates-based forecasts.
Structural reforms. With labor market entrants particularly exposed to European tail
risks, steps being actively considered by the social partners to increase the
accommodation of new entrants in employment contract structures are strongly
supported. And in the housing sector, deregulation of rental market could reduce
shortages and improve employment prospects, notably in the main cities.

THE SETTING
1.
Sweden’s macro financial performance over two decades has been strong: robust growth,
low inflation, declining trend unemployment, and rising incomes, low government bond yields,
and strong external positions. But there are vulnerabilities and concerns looking ahead.
2.
In particular, growth prospects in coming years in its major trading partners Germany,
Norway, the United Kingdom, the United States and Denmark—are in question. In Advanced
Europe, cyclical recovery appears to have already run its course and estimates of trend growth
have been lowered from pre-crisis. And in the United States, the cyclical recovery is weaker than
usual after recessions. And while there are upside risks associated with these global projections—
notably progress towards a durable resolution in the Euro Area (EA)—the risks are largely to the
downside: a possible sharp resurgence of strains in the EA; or/and a « lost decade » of growth
there; and in either context, possible further oil supply shocks. And despite some improvement,
the global financial system remains vulnerable (See the Risk Assessment Matrix). In this light, can
Sweden’s strong performance continue?

SWEDEN

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

There are reasons for concern
3.
Sweden’s record has largely been achieved in the context of a buoyant global economy.
Sweden is small and open, and so is highly exposed to its trading partners, notably Europe, which
purchases some 70 percent of its exports of goods and services. Furthermore, the particular
composition of Swedish exports—dominated by investment and intermediate goods—exposes it to
the most cyclical components of demand in the European and global economies, which up to 2008,
were in upswing. But trend and cyclical external prospects have weakened (Box 1). Furthermore, as
an oil importer, global oil supply shocks matter (despite being an European Union leader on
renewable energy), directly and—if oil shocks compound global weakness—indirectly.
4.
And Sweden features an outsized financial sector, some 5½ times GDP. Though direct
exposure to the EA periphery is low, Sweden’s assets are dominated by claims on core EA and the
Nordic-Baltic region, both of which are vulnerable to tail risk strains in the EA. And well over half of
banking liabilities are wholesale, exposing Sweden directly to liquidity shocks in global financial
markets (Box 1).
5.
Furthermore, even the strength of Sweden’s sovereign may be proving to be a mixed
blessing—by causing appreciation of the krona. The fiscal rules targeting a 1 percent of GDP surplus
across the cycle alongside multi-year nominal expenditure ceilings, all scrutinized by a stridently
independent fiscal council, are long established and credible. And the downward trajectory for debt
they imply is resilient to standard shocks (See Box 2 and the 2011 Selected Issue Paper). But this is
attracting capital inflows. Though not yet to the extent of Japan or Switzerland, these inflows have
recently taken the krona to historic highs vis-à-vis the dollar and euro, further curbing export
prospects.
And recent developments underscore the spillovers from the global economy
6.
As global demand recovered, Sweden grew by 6.1 percent in 2010 and 4 percent in 2011.
And reflecting the small employment gap and a negative output gap (estimated by staff at around
¾ percent for 2011), headline Consumer Price Index (CPI) has remained above the 2 percent target.
But, as elsewhere in the region and Advanced Europe, momentum has weakened. After growing by
a cumulative 2.1 in the first three quarters of 2011, Sweden's Q4 2011 GDP surprised markets on the
downside by contracting1.0 percent in Q4, and then by growing 0.8 percent in Q1 2012.

7.
In particular, exports, which surged back in 2010, softened through 2011 (albeit with a
similar volatile quarterly path as GDP in Q4 2011 and Q1 2012)—with high frequency indicators
suggesting that this overall muted performance continues. Alongside, fixed investment has also
eased from 2010. Though the level of private consumption has not fallen, its growth remains
lackluster despite resilient employment and incomes into the early part of 2012—in part reflecting
that unemployment remains elevated relative to the immediate pre-crisis period. Excluding 2008–09,
household confidence is low historically, while household credit growth has slowed by over
3 percentage points from a year earlier to 5½ percent. Declining wealth and a low confidence have
led to further increases in household saving rates.
8.
At the same time, while both temporary and permanent employment increased in 2010, with
permanent jobs numbers now significantly surpassing pre-crisis levels, job creation seems to have
slowed. And both labor force participation and unemployment remain high (the latter at around
7½ percent—some 1½ percentage points above 2008 levels). Within this, the proportion of young,
older and long-term unemployed in total unemployment have all increased considerably relatively
to pre-crisis, with flexibility—including via increasing use of temporary employment agencies—at a
premium in hiring.
9.
These output and labor market trends have also affected fiscal developments. Strong growth
in 2011 was reflected through automatic stabilizers in a strengthening of the overall balance in 2011
by 0.2 of a percentage point of GDP, shifting to a small surplus of 0.1 percent from a deficit of
0.1 percent GDP in 2010. In this context, the temporary fiscal stimulus measures were phased out,
including support to municipalities and county councils and investments in infrastructure and
training. This, combined with the ongoing effects of previous reforms (including the reduction in
sick-leave payments), reduced expenditure by 1.1 percentage points of GDP.
10.
But the underlying fiscal stance remained supportive—notably reflecting the tax reduction
for pensioners in 2011—with staff calculations suggesting that the 2011 outcome fell short of the
1 percent structural surplus target by 0.8 percentage points. Data for the first months of 2012 show

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SWEDEN 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

a slowdown in central government tax revenue compared to the previous year, indicating that
economic slowdown in the last quarter of 2011 is already taking a toll on revenues.
11.
Meanwhile, demand for credit has held up. Corporate credit has recovered, albeit slowly,
from the credit slump in the aftermath of the Great Recession. In the household sector, credit
growth was very strong, but has decelerated to around 5 percent over the past year, reflecting in
part the tightening of macroprudential regulations—such as LTV regulations, applying interest rate
surcharges on loans above 85 percent of LTV.
12.
In 2011 inflation averaged around 3 percent but underlying inflation measured by the CPIF
(that is the CPI with a fixed mortgage rate) was lower at 1.4 percent, while CPIF excluding energy
was lower still averaging around 1 over the year. The annual rate of increase of the CPIF amounted
to only ½ percent in December 2011—as the economy slowed and the krona gained strength. The
gap between the various measures of inflation remains wide as mortgage rates have led the CPI to
increase more rapidly than the CPIF.
13.
In line with these developments, following a series of steps between January and July 2011
that brought the repo rate from 1.25 to 2 percent alongside various macro prudential actions to cool
housing markets, the Riksbank paused in August-September as Europe sovereign debt market strains
intensified. It then lowered the policy rate by 25 basis points both in December 2011 and February
2012, reflecting the deteriorating external environment and benign inflation indicators. The passthrough of these actions to households’ mortgage rates has been less than complete, however
(Box 3).
14.
In that context, inflation expectations remain anchored near the target, and inflation fell
below 2 percent Jan-Mar 2012—while core inflation (measured by the CPIF excl. energy) has
averaged 1.1 percent. Growth in unit labor costs has been low, although it picked up slightly in the
second half of 2011, reflecting a pause in the upward trend in labor productivity since the recovery
began.
15.
And conditions in Swedish banking markets have tracked the ebb and flow of those in
European banking. Swedish banks’ risk-weighted capital ratios remain relatively high with negligible
exposures to strained EA countries. In addition, earnings have increased—thanks to increased
lending on the back of strong domestic growth—and loan losses have fallen to low levels—mainly
reflecting an improved situation in the Baltic countries. As a result, access to international capital
markets has remained secure.
16.
But as stresses again mounted in Europe, CDS spreads and expected default frequency
measures rose. This was most notable for Nordea, the largest Swedish bank, reflecting its exposures
to the region and core advanced Europe. And in May 2012, Moody’s downgraded the long-term
debt ratings for Nordea and Handelsbanken by one notch to Aa3, in part reflecting their reliance on
wholesale funding. Moreover, generally poor capital market conditions have hit non-bank financial
institutions, such as insurance. The average solvency ratio of life insurance firms has fallen sharply
since the middle of 2011, although its level remains around 8 times minimum requirements.

17.
On the external side, with weakening global demand since mid 2011, Sweden’s trade surplus
shrank to its narrowest in more than a year at the end of 2011—as exports of goods fell after the
summer. Nevertheless, with imports of investment goods also weak, Sweden’s current account
remains positive (in 2011 Q4 at 7.2 percent of GDP), albeit still weaker than 2007 levels. In part, this
is because the positive net income contribution has increased following a rebound in returns on
portfolio investment in Europe.
18.
In the financial accounts, capital inflows were concentrated into portfolio investment in
government and corporate securities, balancing large but falling outflows through FDI and other
investments. This shift seems to reflect growing uncertainty about Europe, strong confidence in
Sweden’s macroeconomic policies, and ample global liquidity.
19.
These recent macrofinancial developments all underscore the importance of spillovers into
Sweden. But developments in capital flows and hence in the krona underscore that indeed “this time
may be different”. In particular, with portfolio inflows strong, the krona was little changed vis-à-vis
the euro during the first four months of 2012, after strengthening 1.6 percent in 2011, a marked
contrast to 2008–09 when the krona weakened sharply as external conditions softened. While
apparently still in the neighborhood of levels suggested by medium-term fundamentals—but
indeed possibly with room for further appreciation—the contrast to 2009 in the krona’s response to
deteriorating external circumstances could not be more marked (Box 4).
20.
So continued weakness of activity is likely in 2012. Staff projects GDP growth to drop from
4 percent in 2011 to 1 percent in 2012, then to rebound to 2 ⅓percent in 2013, broadly tracking
projections for activity in Advanced Europe and somewhat more optimistic than the Riksbank’s
projection and consensus (both around ½ percentage point less, but based on information prior to
the release of the Q1 2012 National Accounts).
21.
Activity in 2012 is projected to be sustained by steady personal consumption (despite
moderating house prices and some rise in unemployment, accommodative fiscal conditions,
continued non-residential property investment, and strong international non-oil commodity prices).
But net exports and business investment will remain sources of weakness, reflecting global demand
and actions to tighten domestic bank regulations. Overall, the output gap is estimated at around
zero in 2011 Q4, and under these projections, will open up again in 2012 (-0.4 percent), subduing
core inflation.

22.
For 2013, stronger European and global growth alongside continued momentum in
consumption are projected to lift growth, closing the output gap again by end 2013. Inflation is
expected to remain contained throughout the projection period thanks to a small and slowly-closing
output gap.
23.
Potential growth is projected to recover gradually to around 2½ percent, after falling an
estimated ¾ of a percentage point from the pre-crisis trend, owing to the sharp decline in
investment in 2009. Thereafter, the catch-up for investment “lost” during the crisis is expected to
raise potential growth further.
24.
But even apart from the strength of the krona, two elements in the domestic economy could
amplify the impact of external slowdown and downside tail risk.


First, price-to-income ratios in the housing market remain elevated, with staff estimates
suggesting overvaluation in the region of 10 percent. Thus, domestic housing fragilities
could amplify the macroeconomic effects of external developments (Box 5).



Second, and despite some strengths—including the covered bond arrangements and the
tier 1 capital ratios—the financial sector remains a concern. The system is large,
concentrated, complex, and reliant on short-term wholesale funding. It also has significant
domestic and regional exposure to real estate, with elevated level of household debt in
Sweden (170 percent of disposable income), softening house prices, and a high share of
interest-only mortgages. Furthermore, curbs in welfare insurance in recent years could make
mortgage lending less secure than formerly. These fragilities could raise the prospect of
increased credit losses in the event of a sustained regional recession.

THE IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICY
25.
The core issue is the extent to which policies should now be set to anticipate downside tail
risks or the central slow-growth EA scenario. The former would call for aggressive further accrual of
buffers now in fiscal and financial sector policies while the latter would call for an accommodative
stance now.
26.
Policies have been set to address both near-term weakness and downside tail risks. In
particular, in the financial sector, various steps have been taken to bolster resilience, with more
underway. Alongside, the government budget remains firmly guided by its medium-term rules,
thereby allowing stabilizers free rein to reflect the economic cycle. And with medium-term inflation
expectations anchored at the target, the monetary policy stance remains accommodative with the
policy rate negative in real terms. Both fiscal and monetary policy instruments have room to make
decisive adjustments should tail risks materialize.

A. Financial Stability
27.
Given the large size of the sector and its direct exposure to core EA countries, the financial
sector represents a key contingent fiscal risk, given European tail risks. Efforts to contain the impact
of these risks on Sweden are nested within the Basel III and broader EU initiatives, including CRD IV,
while acknowledging that Swedish financial sector contingent risks may not be fully reflected in EUwide prescriptions.
28.

The system has a number of strengths:



In domestic markets, historically low mortgage losses, limited buy-to-let markets, openended personal liability, and well-developed welfare and social security systems (albeit some
erosion in recent years), all curtail risks of major credit losses.



Externally, direct exposures to the most vulnerable peripheral countries are small, and
market indicators also suggest small spillover risks arising from these countries.



Furthermore, over the past few years, banks increased capital ratios including through rights
issues, retained earnings, and reductions of higher risk assets. As of end March 2012, under
the Basel II definition, core Tier 1 capital ratios range between 12 and 16 percent, and even
under much stricter new Basel III definition, common equity Tier 1 capital ratios are
estimated to be between 11 and 15 percent.



And banks have strengthened overall liquidity—including as indicated by the Riksbank’s
short-term liquidity measure—by increasing longer-term funding and liquid assets.



A stability fund was established in 2008, and the Deposit Insurance System was reformed in
July 2011 to be fully consistent with the revised EU Deposit Insurance Directive.

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SWEDEN 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

And the 2008–09 crisis confirmed that the authorities’ crisis readiness is high.



29.
Nevertheless, given heightened European tail risks, recognition of large fiscal contingent
liabilities, and lack of a common European backstop, the authorities have not rested, moving ahead
of European norms in some areas. In particular, in November 2011, the financial regulator (FI)
proposed that the common equity Tier 1 capital requirements for four major banks would be at least
10 percent from the beginning of 2013, and 12 percent from the beginning of 2015. The move
preceded the recent CRD IV consensus. Further, since July 2011, banks have been subject to new
liquidity reporting requirements, which enable the authorities to monitor Basel III-type liquidity
indicators. The next step planned is the introduction of the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR)
requirements in total currency position and for euro and US dollar currency positions separately in
January 2013. Resources of the FI are being raised over the next few years, while legislative
amendments have been made to clarify FI autonomy. And the Council for Cooperation on
Macroprudential Policy (CCMP), comprising the Riksbank and the FI has been established to
strengthen cooperation among supervisors and held its first meeting in February 2012. One of the
CCMP’s tasks includes coordinating Sweden’s response to recommendations made by the ESRB and
Basel committees.
30.
In this light, the authorities’ recent stress tests suggest that even under severe EA recession
scenarios, banks would be able to maintain a 10 percent core Tier 1 capital ratio under the Basel II
definition— although one bank’s common equity Tier 1 capital ratio could go under 10 percent
under the Basel III definition. This coincides with the broadly reassuring assessment provided by the
2011 FSAP Update.
31.
However, while standard stress tests reassure the resilience of the Swedish banking system,
current European circumstances suggest that a shock beyond historical experience could not be
disregarded. Furthermore, the comfort of high risk-weighted assets is qualified by the fallibility of
the measure. Raw common equity ratios are as low as 4 percent for some banks, while risk weighted
assets continue to fall to around 25 percent of total assets—among the lowest in Europe. Further,
direct and indirect exposures to the core EA and associated tail risks are significant. And despite
progress, banks liquidity risks remain substantial, due in part to reliance on short-term funding,
including on their US dollar books. Likewise, household debt continues to rise and is now 1.7 times
disposable income, as highlighted in the 2012 EC Alert Mechanism Report.
32.
Accordingly, further progress is needed urgently beyond simply focusing on capital ratios, to
bolster financial system resilience:
Strengthen bank capitalization further, specifically by raising risk weights


High risk-weighted capital ratios in part reflect low risk weights for residential mortgages—
reflecting Internal Rate Based (IRB) models. But these may overlook tail risks outside of
historical experience, and so exaggerate resilience. Joint efforts by the regulators and the
private sector to review the appropriateness of risk-weight calibration are underway. In this
light, as a potential measure, imposing a regulatory floor on risks weights on residential

mortgages can be considered. More broadly, the appropriate use of IRB models should be
under constant scrutiny by supervisors, and disclosure of methodology and assumptions can
be further enhanced.

Strengthen liquidity requirements


A step following the planned introduction of the LCR regulation in 2013 includes preparation
to introduce a Basel III net stable funding ratio (NSFR)-type measure in the medium term.
Meanwhile, banks should continue to raise their NSFRs towards 100 percent and publish
them. But the pace of balance sheet adjustments to meet the NSFR should be set in light of
a review of their short-term impact on banks’ ability to collect deposits and issue longer
debts and on the availability of “safe” assets under regulatory rules. In this regard, there are
merits of reviewing the adequacy of Basel III liquidity standards for Sweden but any issues
should be addressed in the context of ongoing international review of the Basel III
standards.



Going forward, the stability fund may be reformulated to introduce a risk-based contribution
so that a bank taking a higher risk should bear appropriately higher contributions. This
should discourage banks from risky activity. However, this should be coordinated with EUlevel initiatives.

All these regulatory reform actions should be coordinated regionally


All major Swedish banks operate extensively in the Nordic-Baltic region, with Swedish
authorities as the home supervisor. Sweden’s approach to regulatory reform is most
advanced in comparison with other regional supervisors. Thus, notably with respect to the
EU, the practice of extensive prior consultation and coordination with other authorities
should continue, especially when regulatory standards are set beyond the ex-ante agreed
margins, to minimize unintended regulatory arbitrage and to anticipate consequence to
other jurisdictions.

And supervision intensity and crisis management needs to be further upgraded



If there are legal impediments to the FI’s authority to use Pillar II, these should be removed.



In addition, as recommended in the 2011 FSAP Update, legal certainty related to the FI’s
power to take corrective and remedial against a weak bank should be resolved, while a
special resolution framework for non-systemic financial institutions should be established.



With increased resources, the FI should further increase its accountability on resource uses.
At the same time, a common understanding is needed that the additional resources should
maybe used for FI’s financial stability mandate, rather than being driven into other areas
including into the international regulatory reform agenda.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SWEDEN 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT



There are merits of formalizing the meeting procedures of the Domestic Standing Committee for
crisis management, including by regularizing meeting schedule.



On the cross-border side, various bilateral and regional Memoranda of Understanding (MOU)
and EU-wide arrangements provide the basis for cooperation. Importantly, the 2010 Nordic-Baltic
MOU provides the principles of burden sharing. However, this has not been tested. As
recommended in 2011 FSAP Update, the authorities are developing a framework to assess how
the burden-sharing principles work, especially taking account of fiscal positions of each country.
In this light, “war games” could be conducted.



But given that the existing cross border arrangements, mostly based on various MOUs, are not
legally binding, more assurance is needed. And the ongoing efforts to establish “a resolution and
recovery plan” for the largest Swedish banks can be extended to other major banks.

Extension of the CCMP is needed


Developing a macroprudential policy institution involves a learning-by-doing process. Given
establishment of the CCMP, next steps include establishing a formal macroprudential authority,
with a clear financial stability mandate, a set of authorized tools, and accountability obligations.
The merits of including a mechanism to reflect regional perspectives are also worth considering.



To the extent that the sum of these initiatives slows credit supply and growth, monetary policy
should take it into account in the setting of the repo rate and fiscal policy should also
accommodate it via automatic stabilizers (see below).

B. Fiscal Policy Framework
33.
Given that output is close to potential, strong sovereign access to markets, alongside
downside external risks and the modest deviation of the fiscal balance from its structural surplus

SWEDEN

target, the appropriate setting for 2012 would be a mildly supportive stance anticipating a phased
return to the structural surplus target thereafter. Along this trajectory, automatic stabilizers would
operate in case of moderately weaker/stronger than anticipated activity, with scope to reset the
structural fiscal trajectory as well if the global economy deviates markedly from projections.
34.
This fiscal stance would not only support near term activity in the face of downside risks, but
also boost fiscal buffers by further lowering the public debt-to-GDP ratio in the central case. This
would further increase the capacity of the Swedish economy to cope with a sharp and sustained
shock by further increasing the likelihood that the sovereign could maintain market access even
under severe adverse scenarios (See Box 2).
35.
This fiscal trajectory is planned by the authorities. For 2012, as a result of the deceleration of
growth and new discretionary measures being introduced as part of the 2012 Budget Bill, thebudget
balance is expected to remain at -0.3 percent of GDP in 2012. Revenues would remain subdued in
line with weak employment and consumption trends. Expenditures would rise modestly, driven
mainly by higher social benefits. The structural balance would on the authorities’ estimates fall to
1.2 percent of GDP implying a stimulus of 0.2 percent of GDP. Based on staff estimates, the
structural balance falls to -0.3 percent of potential GDP, implying a stimulus of 0.5 percent of
potential GDP. The difference between staff and authorities’ estimates reflects different output gap
estimates and different methodologies to calculate the structural balance.
36.
Alongside, they have increased the expenditure ceiling between 2014–15 by SEK 20 billion.
With this, the expenditure ceiling is expected to increase by 1½ percent in nominal terms over the
next four years, which would leave a budgetary margin of about 1 ½ percent of GDP, based on the
authorities’ assumptions.
37.
Overall, the Budget Bill contains measures of about 0.4 percent of GDP, partly offset as some
previous measures expire. Some of this relates to reforms enacted in 2011 which were reinforced by
ancillary measures in Budget 2012. The main expansionary measures for 2012 are a lowering of the
VAT rate for restaurant and catering services, extra funding for infrastructure investment and a
package of active labor market measures (Box 6). Spending will continue to be reined in part due to
the non-indexation of key expenditures, a further phasing out of temporary stimulus measures, a
decline in unemployment expenditure as the economic recovery takes hold, and the effects of
previous reforms (such as reforms of the sickness insurance system).

1/ Structural balance takes into account output and employment gaps.
2/ Overall balance adjusted for the output gap, based on authorities' measure.

38.
Over the medium term, the authorities plan for revenues as a percentage of GDP to remain
largely unchanged, with the fiscal balance strengthening to target due to a declining expenditure
ratio—in line with the 4-year nominal spending ceilings. The overall balance would exceed 1 percent
of GDP by 2014, and continue to strengthen further over the medium term.
39.
Alongside, the authorities have outlined a number of additional measures, contingent on the
availability of fiscal space, that focus mainly on increasing labor supply and include further
strengthening the “in-work” tax credit and further raising the lower threshold for the state income
tax. They also propose reviewing corporate taxation, and tax cuts for pensioners.
40.
In this context, the tax structure can be further improved to support growth in the more
challenging global context. Tax expenditures are considerable—including multiple VAT rates which
significantly curb VAT collections despite one of the highest standard VAT rates in the OECD. With
distributional concerns attenuated by strong Gini coefficient scores of 0.23 and the possibility of
direct support to low-income households through targeted spending, a restructuring of the VAT
could improve the efficiency of the tax system. The resulting additional VAT collections would create
room to implement reforms that reduce further the overall wedge between employers’ gross pre tax
labor costs and real take-home pay.
41.
Tax and expenditure measures aimed at supporting employment of vulnerable groups
should be better targeted. Though it is too soon to measure the employment impact of recent
reductions in employer social security contributions for young workers and of the VAT on
restaurants, measures more specifically designed to affect workers with greater difficulties in
entering the labor market would likely be more effective.
42.
Additional measures could be put in place to reduce the procyclicality of local governments’
fiscal position. In view of the balanced budget rules at the local level, the authorities should consider

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

SWEDEN

the merits of allowing them greater flexibility to establish and manage rainy-day contingency funds.
This is particularly important if, under current policy, the structural surplus target rule for the central
government is procyclical ex-post (with the actual structural surplus exceeding historically the
1 percent target).
43.
More generally, adherence to the fiscal surplus target rule over the medium term remains
fully appropriate. Absent shocks, the rule will keep debt on a downward trajectory, but this is
unlikely—as simple extrapolation might suggest—to make the Swedish sovereign a net creditor.
Instead, that trajectory will be disturbed by standard business cycle downturns, pushing debt back
up, and may be further disturbed by tail risk shocks. As evident from the global crisis, several
countries with large financial systems experienced leaps in public debt, both reflecting the impact of
automatic stabilizers and direct financial sector support. With those tail risks still evident in Europe, it
remains appropriate for Sweden to maintain a determined effort—as reflected in its surplus target
rule—to build buffers to increase its ability to withstand such risks, until those risks are eliminated
(See Box 2). The Fiscal Policy Council continues to play an effective role in promoting public
awareness of fiscal issues. Further increases in its resources and its focus on sustainability would
reinforce the credibility of the fiscal framework. These fiscal policy settings would also allow
monetary policy to respond to possible external developments—easing if capital inflows continue
alongside weak external demand, and tightening if activity and domestic inflationary pressures
surge.

C. Monetary Policy and Framework
44.
With the repo rate above the lower effective bound and a fully flexible exchange rate and
the krona likely to depreciate in an adverse tail risk scenario, monetary policy instruments have
room to make decisive adjustments should tail risks materialize. Monetary policy should thus
continue to be set according to the baseline scenario.
45.
Under that baseline scenario, for now, given the benign inflation outlook, modest cost
pressures and the prospect of a temporary slowdown in demand, the repo rate is appropriately set
at 1½ percent. The rate path should, however, be adjusted to reflect the potential impact of stricter
banking regulation and fiscal withdrawal as long as economic slack persist. Macroprudential
instruments—e.g. tightening LTV rules further, adjusting risk-weighted assets, limiting loans’
length—should be deployed further if the housing market reflates once again.
46.
The monetary and free floating exchange rate frameworks remain credible, as indicated by
inflation expectations and recent reviews. However, persistent deviations of market forward rates
(and survey expectations) from the projected official rate have occurred. Although inflation
expectations have remained firmly anchored around the Riksbank’s medium-term target, continued
credibility relies on markets believing the monetary authorities, to ensure an effective transmission
of the short term policy rate to market rates, other asset prices, and the real economy. For these
reasons, persistent and significant disbelief concerning the authorities’ projected policy rate outlook
could, eventually impair the monetary transmission mechanism and, possibly, undermine broader
credibility.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SWEDEN 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

47.
To address this issue, the Riksbank could start publishing macroeconomic forecasts
conditioned on market-implied domestic and foreign forward rates, in addition to forecasts
conditioned on its preferred path for the policy rate, and keep the commitment to publish its
expected policy rate path under review (See Chapter III of the Selected Issue Paper).
48.
Alongside, and in the context of initiatives to establish a macroprudential council, consensus
on the mandate of the Riksbank with regard to asset prices and financial stability should be sought.
And the Riksbank should raise its research efforts further in the area of equilibrium unemployment,
including analysis of its composition, and of macrofinancial linkages as key inputs into policy rates
setting.
49.
And while gross international reserves are 50.4 USD or 344.7 SEK billion, some 23 percent of
imports, and 14.8 percent of short term external debt, the liquidity gap approach developed by staff
last year suggests that there is a case to increase foreign exchange reserves now.1 In particular, the
probability that reserves might be exhausted in the context of a tail risk event, such as default by
one of the European sovereigns now under market pressure, has risen relative to that likelihood a
year ago. Should this probability rise further, the authorities should match their efforts to boost
resilience in other areas by raising reserve cover also.

D. Structural Reform Policy
50.
Sweden’s extensive structural reforms since the early 1990s have boosted trend growth and
employment, as well as strengthening resilience to shocks. Thus, increases in unemployment in
2008–09 fell far short of expectations, and employment recovered promptly thereafter. And
participation rates held up throughout, in contrast to a number of OECD countries.
51.

However there are areas of concern:



The reforms could be better targeted at helping those particular groups of workers facing
the most challenges, including workers with weak attachment to the labor market (for
example, the reduction in payroll taxes for new entrants applies to the entire population of
young potential workers, but only a fraction of these needs help in finding a job).



Recent reforms also reduced the scope and resources for active labor market policies. But
shortfalls in the effectiveness of these programs likely reflected their particular design—
elsewhere, such as in Denmark, reforms have better focused these initiatives rather than
curtailing them.

52.
In contrast to broad initiatives in other sectors, the Swedish housing market is substantially
unreformed, notably the rental and sub-let markets which are subject to severe regulations. Given
Sweden’s fast and ongoing urbanization trend, particularly toward the greater cities (Stockholm,
1

See the chapter in the Selected Issues Paper by Kotaro Ishi.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

SWEDEN

Gothenburg and Malmo), the lack of rental property on the market has been one key determinant of
house price surges (and house price resilience) over the past years. In this light:


Deregulation of rental markets could reduce shortages and improve employment prospects
as well as skill shortages, particularly in the main cities, with likely impacts on potential
output growth in the medium term;



This would help to raise investment in residential property—where Sweden scores amongst
the lowest in the EU. This will require initiatives at the local and central government level to
raise the amount of land available for construction, in order to ensure that supply rises in
line with fundamentals and to prevent a further acceleration in prices.

THE AUTHORITIES' VIEWS
53.
The authorities agreed with the overall assessment of economic developments in Sweden
and internationally, and the implications for policy including in the financial sector.
54.
More specifically, they noted concerns with the macrofinancial implications of high
household debt, and in this context sought early strengthening of bank capital and various
improvements in the macroprudential policy architecture. In addition, they emphasized need to
build fiscal buffers further, while, in that context, also seeing scope for free application of automatic
stabilizers in the near term. This stance, and the recent relaxation of monetary policy would support
activity, with macroprudential measures in place to stabilize the housing market. Policymakers stand
ready to adjust policy settings in the event of a major global shock.
55.
Within that overall agreement, however, some differences of emphasis from the staff were
noted:
Financial Sector Policies


The authorities do not see strong evidence that the quality of new mortgage lending raises
prudential concerns because borrowing households have sufficient capacity to repay debt
even under macroeconomic stress scenarios, while more marginal borrowers are unlikely to
have access to credit—so that, for instance, increases in temporary employment contracts in
recent years would not materially affect overall risk of credit losses. Nevertheless, these
matters would remain under close scrutiny.



The authorities agreed with staff that the status quo of the macroprudential supervisory
architecture is not satisfactory, but they noted that the proper role of the Ministry of Finance
in any better structures remains open. While all agree that the Ministry should be
deterministic in resolution and crisis management, and that it should not be responsible for
making stability assessments and recommendations at other times, there is not yet
agreement on where to draw the line between those two circumstances, nor on how that

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SWEDEN 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

line should be drawn. The matter will be considered further in the "Government
Investigation on Financial Crisis Prevention and Management Issues” (the Franzén
Commission), though the authorities intend, in the meantime, to put the Consultation
group2 on a more solid footing.


The fiscal authorities emphasized need make progress to further reinforce financial sector
stability but also cautioned that steps taken should not risk, inadvertently, causing disorderly
adjustments in credit markets or financial institutions. In securing this balance, they inclined
to proceed in a sequence, with initiatives phased according to the strength of economic
conditions—accelerating in good times when markets could more easily absorb them, and
being prudently paused otherwise.

Fiscal Policy and Framework


The authorities estimate a stronger underlying fiscal position than the staff for 2011–12. This
reflects the authorities’ use of the OECD aggregate elasticity of 0.55, in contrast to the staff’s
disaggregated adjustments using both output and employment gaps. Specifically, the fiscal
authorities’ estimates of the cyclically adjusted balance in 2011–12 are 0.7 and 1.2 percent of
potential GDP, respectively. Meanwhile, staff’s estimates are 0.1 percent of potential GDP for
2011 and -0.4 percent of potential GDP for 2012.



In contrast to staff's view that further stimulus in 2013 should be contingent on weaker than
expected activity, the authorities indicated that they see scope, partly reflecting their
estimate of the structural surplus, to implement discretionary measures in 2013, specifically
to undertake greater investment spending.



The authorities see recent measures to address youth unemployment, such as the reduction
in employer social security contributions and the reduction of the rate of VAT on restaurants,
as a way to increase the opportunities of young workers entering the labor market, while
staff believes that better targeted measures would be more appropriate.

Monetary Policy and Framework


The authorities see the existence of a large and persistent wedge between their projected
official rate and markets’ implied interest rate expectations as somewhat problematic, while
emphasizing that measurements of implied expectations are inherently imprecise and
uncertain. The wedge is not seen as harming the central bank’s credibility on the grounds
that inflation expectations continue to remain anchored around the inflation target. They
intend to continue publishing their own preferred policy paths, as it has served well as a
communication tool.

The Consultation group was established in accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding signed in 2009 between the
Government Offices (Ministry of Finance), Sveriges Riksbank, Finansinspektionen, and the Swedish National Debt Office regarding
cooperation in the fields of financial stability and crisis management.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT



The current understanding in the majority on the MPC is that it is appropriate to take into
consideration financial stability issues. This stance will be reviewed in the context of
initiatives to establish a macroprudential council.



The monetary authorities have participated in a domestic discussion on estimates of the
long-run sustainable rate of unemployment. Further analysis will be made, even though the
returns in terms of improved information for rate setting are seen as low.

STAFF APPRAISAL
56.
Sweden has long secured strong growth, low inflation, declining government debt, rising
incomes, and a strong external position. But trade and financial linkages mean that prospects are
closely tied to those of Europe—reflected in the V-shaped passage through the Great Recession,
and rising stresses in the banking system and declining underlying growth momentum since mid2011.
57.
Monetary and fiscal policies have responded well to this cycle, both tightening appropriately
as output recovered in 2010–11 and easing in the latter parts of 2011. And on the structural side,
various actions were launched in support of employment. Nonetheless, with exports likely soft,
muted annual GDP growth is projected in 2012, albeit with activity regaining steam from mid-year,
with European fragilities implying significant tail risks.
58.
Policies are well calibrated. In particular, the government budget remains firmly guided by its
medium-term rules, thereby allowing automatic stabilizers to operate. And with medium-term
inflation expectations anchored at the target, the monetary policy stance remains accommodative.
And policies have room to make decisive adjustments should tail risks materialize.
59.

But the challenges are extensive.

60.
On the financial stability side, though direct exposures to strained Euro Area economies are
negligible and risk-weighted bank capital is high, the financial system is large, directly exposed to
Europe, highly concentrated, and reliant on wholesale funding, with low raw capital ratios.
Furthermore, vulnerabilities are apparent in elevated household debt, the soft housing market, and
employment and income uncertainties. While standard financial sector stress tests reassure, shocks
could go well beyond the historical norms they assume.
61.
In this light, the EU-wide banking regulations under the Fourth Capital Requirements
Directive will be key. Given the common floor, the particular risks in Sweden and the lack of a
common European banking backstop argue for full use of the flexibility for national regulators given
in that agreement to implement country-specific macroprudential policies.
62.
So the authorities rightly plan to raise capital requirements for the four major banks in steps
in 2013 and 2015, augmented by needed increases in risk weights for mortgages, alongside tighter
liquidity regulations and strengthened supervisory resources, focus, and coordination. In this

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SWEDEN 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

context, the practice of extensive prior consultation and coordination with European partners should
continue.
63.
But considerably more remains to be done. Additional steps include ensuring that
supervisors are able to make effective use of "Pillar 2", and securing an appropriate application of
the additional regulatory resources that have been provided. Other necessary steps include
strengthening early intervention and resolution powers of the supervisors, assessments (as for
capital) of the adequacy of international liquidity standards for Sweden, extension of resolution
planning to all major banks, and deepening regional supervisory coordination and crisis
management under the Nordic-Baltic arrangements. Establishment of a macroprudential authority is
under consideration. It will be key to have clarity on the stability mandate, decision-making
structure, tools, and accountability—all respecting the independence of the Riksbank and bank
supervisors.
64.
On the fiscal side, output close to potential, strong access to market financing, risks tilted to
the downside, and the credibility of the medium-term fiscal rules framework all call for and allow for
the automatic stabilizers to operate unimpeded. And given tail risk of large jumps in public debt,
this budget stance also retains appropriately large fiscal buffers.
65.
In this context, both the modest relaxation of the fiscal deficit in 2012 which leaves public
debt on a downward trajectory, and the framework of rules targeting 1 percent of GDP surplus over
the cycle and nominal expenditure ceilings are appropriate.
66.
In addition, the tax structure could be more “growth friendly”, notably via better-targeting of
tax and expenditure measures. And actions to bolster further the Fiscal Policy Council—notably by
further increasing its resources and its focus on sustainability—would reinforce the credibility of the
fiscal framework.
67.
On the monetary side, the stance is appropriately accommodative given the benign inflation
outlook, modest cost pressures, and a temporary slowdown in demand. Monetary policy should
continue to be set according to the baseline scenario—offsetting any drag on activity emanating
from prudential actions while slack in the economy remains. The stance of policy can be adjusted
rapidly if tail risks are realized. Macroprudential instruments should be deployed further if the
housing market reflates once again.
68.
The monetary and free floating exchange rate frameworks remain credible. However, given
persistent deviations of market forward rates from the projected official rate, the Riksbank could
also start publishing macroeconomic forecasts conditioned on market implied forward rates, and
keep the commitment to publish its expected policy rate path under review. Alongside, consensus
on the role of asset prices and financial stability in monetary policy objectives should be sought.
69.
And on structural reforms, with labor market entrants particularly exposed to European tail
risks, steps being actively considered by the social partners to increase the accommodation of new
entrants in employment contract structures are strongly supported. And in the housing sector,

Box 1. Should Sweden Be Concerned of Adverse Inward Spillovers from Europe?
So far Europe’s sovereign debt turmoil had modest financial and trade effects on Sweden. While Sweden’s stock
and credit market volatility increased as the crisis erupted in the summer of 2011, corporate bond spreads have
increased modestly since early September, and short-term funding markets have been largely unaffected, owing to
the economy’s relatively strong fundamentals. In addition, government yields have declined benefiting from
investors’ flight to quality. However, in the last quarter of 2011, Sweden’s trade account has been significantly
impacted by the European crisis due to its considerable exposure to European trade.
Going forward, a scenario of increased financial market stress in Europe, could trigger larger effects. With 70
percent of Swedish total exports going to the EU, Sweden’s direct trade exposure is large. In addition, spillovers of
Europe to the rest of the world may affect Sweden’s exports indirectly. Further developments could increase
uncertainty of the global recovery, soften the EU demand for Swedish exports, and dampen global demand for
commodities—which Sweden exports.

Despite recent pressures in European banking markets, there have been no material dislocations in Swedish
financial markets. Sweden’s banks’ total financial claims on peripheral European economies are modest as a share
of assets and Tier-1 capital. Claims on smaller European economies (like Denmark and Finland) linked to the Euro
Area as well as on larger European economies, including the U.K., are significantly larger, however.

Box 2. Fiscal Buffers: How Big Are They? How Big Should They Be?
Fiscal buffers are adequate if the Swedish sovereign is able to maintain market access through and after a “large” shock.
This critically depends on the impact on public debt of the shocks that could occur, and the threshold debt level at which
market access is lost.
In this regard, a useful exercise is to replicate the experience of countries severely affected by the global financial crisis, within
the Swedish fiscal framework. Specifically, the exercise entails using as macroeconomic assumptions for the fiscal

forecast the observed growth, employment, consumption, financial sector support, and real exchange rate
developments of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Iceland since 2008. The main advantage of this approach
is that the shock is plausible (and has in fact taken place elsewhere recently, in the contest of the global turmoil) and
would allow each macroeconomic factor to respond in a distinct manner to the shock. This exercise does not assume any
type of fiscal policy response, either to contain the decline in growth or to reverse the deterioration of the fiscal accounts.
Table 1 shows the projections. If economic activity were to behave as it did in the United Kingdom and the United States,

the fiscal deficit would deteriorate by about 3 percentage points of GDP, through a combination of lower revenues as
consumption contracts, and higher expenditure in response to the decline in employment. Debt to GDP would rise to
about 50 percent of GDP, including the cost of the banking sector support.
In contrast, the impact of a shock like that faced by Iceland would be more severe. The fiscal balance would deteriorate by
about 8½ percent of GDP, mainly due to a collapse in consumption and employment. In this case, debt to GDP would

rise above 80 percent of GDP, including the financial sector support (assumed to be only half that of Iceland, in
proportion to the size of Sweden’s financial sector).

The second step in the analysis is to consider at what level of public debt Sweden risks losing market access. Determining such
a threshold is difficult. Sweden’s experience during the 1990s crisis showed that the sovereign was able to retain market

access with debt to GDP ratios close to 75 percent, but at a high cost. This suggests that debt ratios beyond this level
could result in market pressures. Furthermore, under a tail scenario affecting Europe in coming years, this threshold
could well be optimistic, as many countries would simultaneously be seeking to finance large borrowing requirements in

the context of disorderly global financial markets.

This analysis has clear implications for the authorities’ current policy stance. While Sweden would be able to
accommodate a shock similar to that recently faced by the United Kingdom and the United States without losing market
access, it is unlikely to be able to absorb a shock as large as seen in Iceland. In this light, the authorities’ preference to
continue to build buffers is cautious, but given the scale of the impact of possible European tail risks, appropriately so.

Box 3. How Strong is the Pass-through from Repo Rates to Mortgage Rates in Sweden?
As emphasized by analysis by the Riksbank in the February 2012 Monetary Policy Report, the pass-through
of monetary policy impulses from the policy rate to mortgage rates has weakened according to various
measurements over the past year. When assessed relative to before the crisis this phenomenon is milder but
still not equaled in peer countries, with the exception of the United Kingdom.
Prior to the crisis, mortgage pass-through, measured by the simple correlation coefficient between the repo
rate and the effective interest rate on housing loans to households and NIPSHs, indicated that Sweden had a
very strong transmission to long-term rates in this category of lending. The correlation coefficient of 0.99
compares favorably with the U.K. (0.82) and well above that of the U.S. (0.67) and Germany (0.65).
Since 2008Q1, the pass-through in Sweden (measured by the correlation coefficient between the policy and
mortgage rates) has dropped marginally, though, according to this metric (to 0.96), even if it remains higher
than that of any of the comparators.

Box 4. Competitiveness and the Equilibrium Real Exchange Rate
Since September 2008, the Swedish krona has fluctuated substantially, and the krona has now (end March
2012) appreciated in real effective terms by over 25 percent since its trough in early 2009 (and by around
30 percent against the euro).
According to OECD PPP-measures of February 2012, the krona is at its highest level for 40 years.
However, staff’s estimates based on the IMF’s new External Balance Assessment (EBA) methodology, suggest
that the krona remains undervalued relative to its long-run equilibrium, broadly in line with the assessment
arrived at using the IMF’s old CGER methodology using data up to Fall 2011.

There are caveats to these results:
1. Staff’s longstanding finding of undervaluation sits uneasily with the absence of distortions and no
foreign exchange rate intervention for over a decade
2. Pension and other social protection reforms—notably a phased shift to defined contributions pension
scheme and a progressive shrinkage in transfers, like unemployment benefits—since the mid 1990s have
raised household net saving—but these factors are not reflected in the CGER or EBA.
3. While the EBA is based on a NFA of 20 percent of GDP, the cumulative sum of current account surpluses
over the past decade suggests NFAs around 100 percent of GDP—qualifying Sweden as a financial centre.
This would raise its CA/GDP norm in the EBA analysis.
4. So great caution is needed when inferring krona misalignments based on the sustainability of the
country’s NFA/GDP trajectory. Alongside other indicators the staff assessment is that the currency is
competitive, although there are wide margins of uncertainty.
In line with these considerations, the staff’s overall assessment is that Sweden’s structural current account is
now around 2–4 percent higher than what suggested by medium-term fundamentals, which, in turn, have
been strong relative to the Euro Area, including from wage moderation, and safe-haven flows.
The strength of the external sector suggests an undervaluation. However this likely reflects some structural
factors such as higher savings rates following the phased-in pension reform, which are unlikely to adjust
quickly.

Box 5. How Vulnerable Is Sweden’s Housing Market?
The residential real estate cycle may have reached its long-predicted peak in Sweden. Housing starts halved
over 2011 while the real prices dropped substantially in the second half of 2011 (-3.5 percent cumulatively)
and remained flat in 2012 Q1 (q-o-q). The surge in late 2010 and early 2011, following the decline through
2008, appears to have been due to buyers taking advantage of the low interest rate environment and to
the abolition of the real estate tax in 2008 in favor of a municipal tax set at the lower of SEK 6,825 (around
969 euros) or 0.75 percent of the property's assessed value. Indeed, in the two years to 2011 Q2, residential

Going forward, several factors may
indicate further downward pressure
on house prices. First,

ratios remain 1.1 and 1.4 standard
deviations respectively above
historical averages. Second, staff’s
model-based estimates from the

Countries (VEA) suggest an
overvaluation around 11–12 percent,
exceeding the 10 percent threshold.
(The EWE real estate model combines
these three indicators to create a
heat map for house price valuation.)
Moreover, the predicted path of
house prices based on WEO income
projections suggests a decline of
almost 5-6 percent through 2017.

These indicators put Sweden among the advanced countries where a house price correction is most likely
to take place. Yet, the point estimate for the house price disequilibrium (the difference between actual
prices and estimated equilibrium or long-run prices) is not large by historical standards, and Sweden ranks
only 9th among 22 advanced economies in the VEA sample in terms of potential overvaluation.
Furthermore, other components of residential real estate vulnerability (namely, potential impact on GDP,
household balance sheets, and mortgage market characteristics) remain moderate or low in Sweden,
compared to other advanced economies. That said, with most mortgages being “rollover” mortgages with
terms of at most five years, any future interest rate increases could put additional strains on already highly
indebted households.

Box 6. Key Measures in the 2012 Budget Bill
With ongoing global uncertainty, the 2012 Budget Bill announced the implementation of temporary
measures that balance the need to address the slowdown in economic activity while keeping public finances
in good order. These measures, some of which are temporary, are estimated at about 0.4 percent of GDP for
2012 and 2013. The measures with the largest fiscal impact include:
Lowering of VAT rate of restaurant and catering services: Reduction of the VAT rate from 25 percent to
12 percent. This would bring it in line with the VAT rate on food and hotel services.
Infrastructure investment: Temporary augmentation of funds for infrastructure maintenance and investments
on road and railway networks, giving priority to the most economically important routes.
Labor market measures: Structural measures to improve employment services and monitoring of job seeking
activities, and more places in labor market programs for people at risk of long-term unemployment.
Temporary increases in the number of employment training and work experience places, and in the number
of places in vocational education.
Tax measures of business and savings: Simplification of taxation of foreign experts, changes in the rules of
closely held companies (3:12 rules), introduction of investment savings account, changes to the taxation of
endowment insurance, and increase the deduction for research and development expenditure.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

SWEDEN

ANNEX I. SWEDEN: MEDIUM-TERM PUBLIC DEBT
SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
1.
Sweden’s fiscal position is expected to remain strong in the baseline scenario. As
economic activity strengthens over the medium term, in line with an improvement in world
growth, consumption and employment are expected to recover fully. This would improve tax
collections, raising the revenue to GDP ratio, although still below the pre-crisis level due to the
implementation of tax cuts in the interim. Expenditures to GDP would decline gradually over the
medium-term, in part as a result of previous reforms. As a result, Sweden’s overall balance would
remain at a strong surplus of about 2½ percent of GDP over the medium term, bringing debt to
GDP to 22 percent in 2017.
2.
However, macroeconomic risks remain, emanating mainly from ongoing uncertainty
regarding global growth and developments in the euro area. Sweden’s exports depend critically
on global demand for consumer durables, capital goods and inventories, and therefore are
highly sensitive to global growth prospects. Continued strains in some euro area countries and
banking systems, with potential spillovers to the core, could translate into significantly lower
growth in Europe and the rest of the world, which would translate into weaker activity in Sweden
and a deterioration of its fiscal position.
3.
Standard scenarios show that debt in Sweden would continue on a downward trend even
under less favorable conditions. Figure 1 illustrates a series of scenarios, including a permanent
½ standard-deviation shock to growth, interest rate and primary balance independently and a
¼ standard deviation shock to the three combined, a one-time 30 percent depreciation of the
REER, and a one-time 10 percent of GDP shock to contingent liabilities. Under all scenarios,
public debt remains on a downward trend and the increase in the level of debt compared to the
baseline is moderate. Under the worst case scenario, based on a shock to growth, gross debt
would reach 35 percent of GDP in 2017, which would still be below the 38.4 percent of GDP
observed in 2011.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with
Sweden
On June 18, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Sweden. 1
Background
Sweden’s recovery from the global crisis was swift reflecting its strong position at the onset of
the crisis, a supportive macro policy response, a flexible exchange rate, and robust demand for
its exports from Germany, Asia, especially China, and other emerging markets as well. As
global demand recovered, Sweden grew just under 6 percent in 2010 and 4 percent in 2011.
And reflecting the small negative output gap (estimated by staff at around ¾ percent for 2011),
headline Consumer Price Index (CPI) has remained above the 2 percent target.
But, as elsewhere in the region and Advanced Europe, momentum has weakened. After
growing by a cumulative 2.1 in the first three quarters of 2011, Sweden's GDP declined by
0.1 percentage points on average in the subsequent two quarters (comprising a contraction of
1.0 percent in Q4, and an expansion of 0.8 percent in Q1 2012).

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
And though the level of private consumption has not fallen, its growth remains lackluster despite
resilient employment and incomes into the early part of 2012—in part reflecting that
unemployment remains elevated relative to the immediate pre-crisis period. Excluding 2008–09,
household confidence is at its lowest since 1996, while household credit growth has slowed by
over 3 percentage points from a year earlier to 5½ percent. Declining wealth and a low
confidence have led to further increases in household saving rates. At the same time, while both
temporary and permanent employment increased in 2010, with permanent jobs numbers now
significantly surpassing pre-crisis levels, job creation seems to have slowed.
Macroeconomic policies have been set to support growth. While the temporary fiscal stimulus
measures adopted during the global financial crisis were phased out, including support to
municipalities and county councils and investments in infrastructure and training, the underlying
fiscal stance remained supportive—notably reflecting the tax reduction for pensioners in 2011—
with staff calculations suggesting that the 2011 outcome fell short of the 1 percent structural
surplus target by 0.8 percentage points. On the monetary policy side, faced with a benign
inflation outlook and an appreciating krona, the Riksbank lowered the policy rate by 25 basis
points both in December 2011 and February 2012, reflecting the deteriorating external
environment.
The economic outlook remains clouded, and the risks to growth are tilted to the downside. On
staff projections, real GDP growth is expected to drop from 4 percent in 2011 to 1 percent in
2012, then to rebound to 2 percent in 2013, broadly tracking projections for activity in Advanced
Europe and somewhat more optimistic than the Riksbank’s projection and consensus (both
around ½ percentage point less, but based on information prior to the release of the Q1 2012
National Accounts). Key downside risks are a possible sharp resurgence of strains in the euro
area; or/and a “lost decade” of growth there; and in either context, possible further oil supply
shocks. In this context, international funding markets could also exhibit significant strains.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended Sweden’s sustained strong macroeconomic performance,
which has been underpinned by prudent policies and effective institutions. Nonetheless,
Directors noted that significant downside risks weigh on the near–term outlook, and lingering
vulnerabilities call for adaptive policymaking and further structural and financial reforms.
They welcomed efforts to strengthen the macroprudential framework and financial sector
oversight through tighter capital and liquidity requirements, and encouraged the authorities to
further their cross border collaboration with regional banking regulators. More broadly, Directors
underscored the importance of strengthening “Pillar 2” of the Basel supervisory framework, as
well as bank resolution and crisis management arrangements. An accountable macroprudential
authority with a clear stability mandate and decision making structure would also buttress
macrofinancial stability.

3
They supported the planned modest relaxation of the fiscal stance this year in the context of
rules targeting a structural fiscal surplus over the business cycle. They agreed that automatic
stabilizers should be allowed to operate unimpeded as activity slows, but a number of Directors
saw also scope for discretionary counter cyclical stimulus in 2013. Directors considered that
better targeted tax and expenditure measures could make the planned medium term fiscal
adjustment more “growth friendly,” and that the credibility of fiscal plans could be enhanced by
greater authority of the Fiscal Policy Council.
They considered the monetary stance appropriately accommodative, given the benign inflation
outlook and the slack in the economy. Nonetheless, they encouraged the authorities to adapt
policy flexibly as the conjuncture evolves. In particular, the monetary stance may need to be
adjusted rapidly if external risks materialize, or macroprudential policies may need to be
tightened further once the housing market reflates. Most Directors agreed that expanding the
communication strategy with the publication of projections based on market interest rates could
further boost the credibility of the monetary and exchange rate frameworks.
They commended Sweden’s track record in implementing structural reforms to boost growth
and employment. They welcomed efforts underway to improve the functioning of the labor
market, in particular measures to increase the absorption of new entrants. Directors agreed that
deregulation of the rental market could stimulate residential investment, reduce shortages, and
improve employment prospects.

Statement by Benny Anderson, Executive Director for Sweden
and Martin Holmberg, Advisor to the Executive Director
June 18, 2012

The Swedish authorities would like to express their appreciation of staff’s comprehensive
and in-depth analysis on the Swedish economy conducted during the 2012 Article IV
consultation. Overall, the authorities agree with the main findings presented in the report.
Short-term outlook and risks
The authorities broadly share staff’s assessment of the economic developments in Sweden
and internationally. After an unexpectedly large GDP fall at the end of 2011, there are some
positive signs in the Swedish economy. GDP growth in the first quarter of 2012 amounted to
0.8 percent. Consumption and investment growth are expected to continue to rise in the
coming periods, but at a somewhat lower rate than normal. The labor market is expected to
weaken temporarily, and resource utilization is lower than normal. Underlying inflation is
currently low as a result of low cost pressures in recent years. Inflation is projected to
increase gradually to 2 percent in the next few years. The repo rate remains at 1.5 percent and
the Riksbank’s repo rate path indicates that it will remain at this low level for around a year.
The authorities agree with staff that considerable uncertainties about the outlook remain. The
situation in the euro area is fragile and sovereign debt problems could worsen. This would
also have a negative impact on the Swedish economy. In such a situation, the repo-rate path
may need to be lowered. At the same time, confidence in economic developments could
return sooner than expected among households, companies, and financial markets. This
would lead to higher domestic demand and to higher inflationary pressures, calling for a
higher repo-rate path.
Sweden’s public finances are sound. The Government has emphasized that the sovereign
debt crisis in Europe means that there is still a need for strong safety margins in public
finances. Over the past year, the growth in household indebtedness has continued to dampen
due to the slow-down in the housing market, the rise in mortgage rates, and the introduction
of loan-to-value regulation. Household debt is now expected to increase at a moderate rate in
the coming period, albeit still slightly faster than households’ disposable incomes.
Financial Stability
The authorities concur with staff’s assessment that the main risks to financial stability in
Sweden lie in the developments in the euro area. The Swedish banks’ direct exposures to the
fiscally weak euro-area countries are small. However, given the banks’ large usage of shortterm wholesale funding, in particular in US dollars, the Swedish banks are vulnerable to
market disruptions and liquidity risks. Financial stability could thus be affected from indirect

2
channels should the sovereign debt crisis in the euro area worsen. At the same time, Swedish
banks are currently well capitalized from an international perspective, giving them an
adequate cushion if risks were to materialize. According to the recent Riksbank stress tests,
Swedish banks would only suffer a limited decline in capital ratios should a severe recession
scenario develop. Moreover, the Swedish authorities have accelerated the implementation of
Basel III capital requirements, and proposed higher capital requirements on the four largest
banks. While the accelerated implementation of higher capital requirements is warranted,
further macroprudential measures should be sequenced in a way that takes due account of
economic conditions.
The authorities are currently reviewing the capital adequacy requirement for mortgages in
Sweden. This will probably lead to higher risk weights for Swedish mortgages, and
consequently lower capital ratios, all else being equal. Nevertheless, the capital ratios are still
expected to be adequate and meet the required levels.
The authorities will also build upon the Swedish experience of early implementation of
enhanced liquidity reporting by introducing LCR in all currencies, in aggregate, as well as in
euro and USD separately, by 2013. In addition, the Riksbank recommends banks to reduce
their structural liquidity risks and approach the minimum level of NSFR as well as improve
the transparency on comparable key figures for public reporting on liquidity risks.
The Pillar 2 mandate for the Swedish FSA (Finansinspektionen, FI) is expected to be
widened through the introduction of CRR/CRD IV (article 99a). This will allow FI to require
higher capital charges, not only for idiosyncratic risks but also for risks to the system, even if
the preferred option is to do so through Pillar 1. FI is also in the process of developing a more
transparent process for Pillar 2, where information will be publicly available.
The argument that high house price-to-income levels present downward pressure on house
prices going forward, needs further backing. The fact that the ratio is above historical average
does not in itself imply that there is a long-term equilibrium below current levels. The priceto-rent ratio may be inappropriate as a measure of house price fundamentals due to the rent
control regulation in Sweden.
Regarding the suggestion to establish a formal macroprudential authority with a clear
financial stability mandate, a set of authorized tools and accountability obligations, the
Swedish authorities would like to note that an inquiry committee – the Government
Investigation on Financial Crisis Prevention and Management Issues – is currently looking
into these issues. Regarding the suggestion to consider regional perspectives, the authorities
would like to note that this is well in line with the cooperation within the Nordic-Baltic
Macroprudential Group that has been further developed during the recent financial crisis.

3
Recently, a process to enhance cross-border cooperation has been started. Specifically, in
accordance with the FSB agenda, the work on a cross-border cooperation agreement on crisis
management for Nordea, the only Swedish G-SIFI, has been initiated, involving the relevant
authorities in Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland.
Cross-border cooperation is likely to be enhanced further and extended to other financial
institutions with the implementation of the forthcoming EU Directive on recovery and
resolution of credit institutions and investment firms.
Fiscal Policy and Framework
The authorities broadly agree with staff’s view of the Swedish fiscal position and the fiscal
policy stance, even if our assessment of the structural saving ratio is somewhat higher at
present. As is pointed out by staff, Sweden’s fiscal position is strong which makes it possible
to continue to support output in the short term without jeopardizing long-run sustainability or
the ability to respond properly, should a downside external risk materialize. Sound public
finances are also a corner stone in the work to achieve full employment and greater welfare.
The authorities welcome staff’s opinion on the importance of retaining appropriately large
fiscal buffers. By following a responsible policy where the surplus target is maintained and
the expenditure ceiling is not exceeded, at the same time as automatic stabilizers are allowed
to work freely, economic growth is supported and a basis created which will enable Sweden
to meet future challenges from a strong position. As staff rightly points out, there is still
considerable risk of new waves of international economic and financial unrest. Maintaining
adequate safety margins in the public finances in order to have sufficient resources to manage
a possible intensified crisis is a priority in Swedish fiscal policy making.
According to the Government’s assessment, some scope for reform will likely emerge in
2013, and this will be compatible with a mildly supportive fiscal stance. Future reform efforts
will primarily focus on structurally warranted measures that will strengthen Sweden’s longterm growth prospects by increasing employment, decreasing unemployment and improving
the functioning of the economy. However, as staff points out, a number of risks remain
which, if realized, may affect the economy negatively. Any reform ambition is therefore
conditional on a sustainable scope for new measures.
The authorities also agree with staff on the importance of a tax system which supports
employment and growth. Full employment is a prerequisite for Sweden to remain a
competitive country with long-term sustainable growth. Continuing to make jobs a priority in
designing policy is of the utmost importance to the Government. To this end, a number of
measures have been taken in the last few years, such as the introduction of an in-work tax
credit and a reduction in social security contributions for young people. As staff points out,
the Government views the reduction of the rate of VAT on restaurants as a way to increase
the opportunities of young workers entering the labor market. This reform will be closely

4
evaluated both from a tax and an employment perspective. So far it has shown promising
effects on both prices and sales in the restaurant sector.
In line with staff recommendation, a proposal to reduce the risk for pro-cyclicality in local
governments’ finances was recently presented. The proposal means that local governments
will be allowed to build balancing reserves, which makes it possible to use a portion of their
surplus from good times to cover deficits incurred as a result of a recession.
Monetary Policy and Framework
The authorities welcome staff’s assessment that the monetary and exchange rate framework
remain credible. In the discussion of the monetary policy framework, staff notes the recent
deviation of the interest expectations embedded in some asset prices from the Riksbank’s
published interest path, arguing that this deviation could eventually impair the monetary
transmission mechanism and potentially undermine credibility. We note that measuring
markets’ interest rate expectations is difficult and any estimate imprecise and uncertain,
especially in times of turbulence in asset markets. Inflation expectations, nevertheless,
remain firmly anchored at around 2 percent and against that background, the difference
between expectations estimated from asset prices and the Riksbank’s published path is not
viewed as harming credibility. The Riksbank endeavors to ensure that its communication is
open, factual, comprehensible and up-to-date. This makes it easier for economic agents to
make sound economic decisions. It also makes it easier to evaluate monetary policy. In this
context, publishing the interest rate path has served as an effective communication tool.
Staff raises the issue of asset prices and financial stability in monetary policy decisions. In
connection with every monetary policy decision, the Executive Board of the Riksbank makes
an assessment of the repo-rate path needed for monetary policy to be well-balanced. A wellbalanced monetary policy is normally a question of finding an appropriate balance between
stabilizing inflation around the inflation target and stabilizing the real economy. According to
the Sveriges Riksbank Act, the Riksbank’s tasks also include promoting a safe and efficient
payment system. Risks linked to developments in the financial markets are taken into account
in the repo rate decisions. With regard to preventing an imbalance in asset prices and
indebtedness, the most important factors, however, are effective regulation and supervision.
Monetary policy only acts as a complement to these. In this context, the authorities look
forward to the recommendations of the above-mentioned Government Investigation on
Financial Crisis Prevention and Management Issues. However, regardless of the outcome of
this investigation, it seems unlikely that monetary policy will not have a role in addressing
financial stability issues going forward.
Staff proposes that the Riksbank should raise its research efforts in the area of equilibrium
unemployment. Continued and enhanced analysis will be conducted as part of the regular
analysis.

5
Structural Reform Policy
The authorities agree with staff that the structural reforms undertaken have boosted trend
growth and employment. Staff also highlights some areas of concern, for example targeting
of reforms towards groups with weak attachment to the labor market. The Government
argues that broad and general reforms that increase incentives to work is the most effective
way to improve labor market outcomes, including for groups with weak attachment to the
labor market. But there are also extensive reforms undertaken directed towards vulnerable
groups (including for example youth, immigrants, disabled and long-term unemployed).
Hence, the general remark in the staff report concerning bad targeting seems somewhat
misplaced. In general, there is a trade-off between simplicity and being able to pinpoint the
most problematic groups. It is the Government’s view that the reduction in pay-roll taxes for
youth increases employment among this group.
In line with empirical evidence concerning active labor market policies (ALMPs), the
Government has focused on job-search early in the unemployment spell, with access to
training, education and subsidized jobs when necessary to enhance employment probabilities.
Recently, a profiling system has been put in place which aims to identify those individuals
who are in need of training early in the unemployment spell. It is the Government’s view that
active labor market programs are organized in an effective way. During the crisis, and also
recently, extra funds were allocated to maintain quality and effectiveness in the setup of
ALMPs.
Housing Policy
The Government has in the Spring Budget for 2012 announced changes in the sub-let market
for owner occupied dwellings. This is expected to both increase the volume of rental
apartments, and the flexibility in the housing market, thus improving the situation in large
cities and fast growing regions where demand for housing is strong.
Also in the Spring Budget for 2012, the Government announced measures that are expected
to increase the housing production. These include a prolongation of the time when rental
apartments cannot be subject to a review of the rent in the “Rent and Tenancies Tribunal”,
and an exemption from real estate tax for newly built houses during the first 15 years. There
are also two ongoing investigations that look at the municipal land designation policy in
order to improve the availability of land for housing. We note that the average number of
persons in each apartment in Sweden is about 2.1 (slightly higher in for example Stockholm),
which is quite low compared to the situation in peer economies.
