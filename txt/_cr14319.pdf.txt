STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
October 24, 2014

KEY ISSUES
Outlook and risks: Growth is projected to reach 2.4 percent in 2014, while core inflation
remains close to the target. Strong export demand has boosted manufacturing
production and employment, and construction activity is starting to recover, supported
by an expansion of public infrastructure spending. The main external risk is a rise in
capital flow volatility caused by uncertainties related to the unwinding of the U.S.
monetary policy stimulus or heightened geopolitical tensions. The main domestic risk is
the effectiveness of implementation of the structural reforms.
Structural Reforms: Major reforms in the areas of energy, education, anti-trust,
telecommunications, and the financial sector have been approved in the past year and a
half. The legislative process for the energy and telecommunications reforms has been
completed recently, clearing the way for implementation. Staff estimates suggest that
the reforms will boost potential output growth by ¾ percentage points to 3½–4 percent
per year.
Macroeconomic Policies: The current policy mix of easy monetary policy and broadly
neutral fiscal policy has helped the recovery this year. The authorities plan to reduce the
fiscal deficit gradually in the medium term, with the goal of setting public debt on a
downward path. A steady and transparent implementation of the structural reforms will
be critical to maintain investors’ confidence and boost potential growth in the medium
term.
Advice from previous Article IV Consultations: The ambitious structural reforms are
consistent with Fund advice from previous consultations. A number of key
recommendations in the 2011 FSAP Update have been implemented, including
strengthening of consolidated supervision.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
1.
Mexico has completed the legislative process underpinning its comprehensive
structural reforms agenda. Important reforms have been approved in the last year and a half in the
areas of energy, telecommunications, anti-trust, labor markets, education, and the financial sector.
Secondary laws for the energy and telecommunication reforms were recently approved by Congress,
clearing the way for implementation. The energy reform opens the door to private investment in the
sector, ending a 75-year state monopoly in oil and gas production and distribution. The first round
of bidding for oil and gas fields will be launched in early 2015, with contracts expected to be
awarded starting in the second half of that year. By enhancing competition, reducing labor market
frictions, and encouraging investment, the reforms are expected to boost the annual growth in
output over the medium term to 3½–4 percent.
2.
After a sharp slowdown in 2013, growth is projected to recover to 2.4 percent this
year. Real GDP grew 1.1 percent in 2013, reflecting weak external demand and a decline in
construction activity. After a slow start of the year affected by a bad winter in the United States,
economic activity has accelerated in recent months. The strong recovery in the US in the second
quarter of 2014 has triggered a rebound in Mexico’s manufacturing production and exports
(especially in the automotive sector). In addition, construction activity is firming up, supported by a
rebound of residential investment and an increase of government spending on infrastructure
(Figure 1). The recovery is increasingly broad-based, with activity in the service sectors picking up as
well.
3.
Labor market indicators suggest that the economy continues to operate below
potential, helping to contain inflationary pressures. Total employment has grown only modestly,
by about 1 percent year-on-year in the first half of 2014, although there has been a notable shift
from informal to formal sector employment. The unemployment rate has inched up since early 2013,
and real wage growth has been subdued. Headline inflation rose to 4½ percent year-on-year in
January 2014, reflecting one-off effects from tax changes (estimated at about 40 basis points). It is
expected to stay around 4 percent in the remainder of 2014, driven by increases in livestock and
government-administered prices, before declining gradually in 2015. Core inflation remains close to
3 percent and long-term inflation expectations are well anchored (Figure 2).
4.
Macroeconomic policies have turned more accommodative. The Bank of Mexico reduced
the policy rate by 50 basis points to 3 percent in June 2014 in the context of limited inflationary
pressures. Fiscal policy is projected to be neutral in 2014, with the structural fiscal balance broadly
unchanged from 2013.1 The fiscal outturn for the first half of 2014 has been broadly in line with the
Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR) budget target of slightly over 4 percent of GDP. On the
revenue side, stronger-than-expected VAT and import tax collection in the first half of the year has

more than offset weaker oil revenues due to declining oil production. The higher revenue has been
matched by higher-than-budgeted public investment spending (Figure 3 and Table 2b).
5.
Mexico’s external position remains broadly consistent with fundamentals. The current
account deficit widened to 2.1 percent of GDP in 2013, reflecting higher net factor payments, while
the trade balance remained stable and moderate. The current account balance and the real effective
exchange rate are broadly in line with fundamentals and desirable policy settings according to staff’s
assessment (Box 1 and Annex I). In 2014, the current account deficit is projected to remain
unchanged with an improving trade balance offset by a continued increase in factor payments. The
nominal and real effective exchange rates have depreciated modestly since end-2013. The current
level of foreign reserves is adequate for normal times according to a range of standard reserve
coverage indicators (Table 6). Gross portfolio inflows have rebounded after a sharp slowdown in Q2
of 2013. Private corporations and the government have taken advantage of the renewed investors’
risk appetite to issue foreign-currency bonds at favorable rates (Figures 4 and 5). In February,
Moody’s raised Mexico’s foreign currency sovereign rating to Aa3, citing the expected positive
impact of structural reforms on potential growth. Looking forward, the structural reforms in energy
and telecommunications are expected to attract significant foreign direct investment.
6.
Commercial bank credit growth has moderated. Commercial bank credit growth slowed
down to about 8 percent year-on-year in nominal terms in the first half of 2014. Among corporate
borrowers, the deceleration has been concentrated in construction: banks reduced sharply lending
to the sector after financial difficulties of the three largest builders surfaced last year. On the
household side, consumer credit growth moderated to 8 percent (from 16 percent last year)
(Figure 6). Growth of mortgage credit by the publicly-owned institution Infonavit (which accounts
for more than a half of the mortgage market) has decelerated to 2 percent in 2014, as lending for
new low-income houses declined over the last year (Box 2).
7.
In contrast, lending by the publicly-owned development banks is growing rapidly. The
financial sector reform has given the development banks a new mandate of promoting more actively
micro-financing and lending to underserved sectors, including small and medium-sized enterprises.
As a result, credit and guarantees extended by these banks have grown rapidly though from a low
base (currently development banks account for only 15 percent of total bank lending or 3¼ percent
of GDP).

OUTLOOK AND POLICY DISCUSSIONS
8.
Real GDP growth is projected to accelerate to 3.5 percent in 2015. Export demand from
the US is expected to remain strong, underpinning the recovery of manufacturing production and
related services. Construction activity should continue to strengthen, supported by the expansion of
public investment in infrastructure and changes in Infonavit’s lending policies.2 Business investment
is expected to recover as spare capacity diminishes and business sentiment improves after the
recent approval of secondary legislation for the energy and telecommunications reforms (Box 3).
Consumption growth would be supported by strengthening labor demand as activity picks up. The
negative output gap—estimated by staff at around 1 percent as of mid-2014—is expected to close
gradually over the next year. Headline inflation should decline toward the 3-percent target in 2015
as tax-related base effects dissipate, food prices return to normal, and fuel price adjustments
moderate.3

A. Structural Reforms: Unlocking Potential Growth
9.
The wave of structural reforms should increase potential output over the medium
term. Overall, the broad package of reforms is expected to stimulate growth through increased
investment, the introduction of new technologies, reduction of business costs, and a rise in
productivity. Preliminary staff estimates, reflected in the baseline projection, suggest an increase in
potential growth to 3½ to 4 percent in the medium term (potential growth is estimated at around
2¾–3 percent in 2014, while actual growth in Mexico has averaged 2½ percent over the last fifteen
years), (Box 4). The external current account deficit is projected to deteriorate slightly in the coming
years as inward foreign direct investment picks up, leading temporarily to higher imports of
machinery and equipment, but should narrow in the medium term as export growth strengthens.
Both oil and non-oil exports should see a boost, reflecting higher hydrocarbons production and
more competitive manufacturing production in the context of lower electricity prices.4
10.
The authorities believe that the reforms could have an even greater impact, boosting
annual growth to the range 4–5 percent. They expect that the energy reform will have a more
significant effect on energy costs and growth as investment is likely to increase rapidly and the
entrance of private sector companies with new technologies would boost efficiency and
productivity. The financial reform could have a large impact given Mexico’s relatively low levels of
2

The large state mortgage lender Infonavit announced in July that it will raise the maximum amount it can lend by
76 percent (to US$65, 700). It will also increase the maturity of its fixed-rate loans to 30 years. The resolution of the
three large homebuilders is expected to be completed in 2015, which should reduce uncertainty and increase the
availability of credit to the construction sector.
3

Starting in 2015 government-regulated gasoline prices will be raised broadly in line with expected inflation (with
the discretion to apply faster increases if world prices rise above those in the domestic market). This is expected to
reduce the rate of headline inflation by about 0.4 percentage points (in the past increases have averaged 10–
11 percent a year).

bank credit to GDP. Finally, the authorities expressed optimism that synergies across the various
reforms will amplify their effects significantly.

B. Managing Risks
11.
The near-term growth outlook remains subject to significant risks. The U.S. economy
appears to be on a steady path to recovery, which is positive for Mexico. However, the risk of
renewed volatility in financial markets remains elevated, recovery in the euro area and Japan has
stalled, growth in many large emerging economies is slowing down, and geopolitical tensions have
increased.




A surge in global financial market volatility. The baseline growth projection is predicated on
a smooth process of U.S. monetary policy normalization, accompanied by strengthening
activity in the United States (Box 5). However, a resurgence of financial market volatility
cannot be ruled out. Potential triggers include an earlier or sharper-than-expected rise in
U.S. interest rates (for example due to an unexpected rise in inflation or a rapid
decompression of U.S. term premia),5 increasing geopolitical risks, or investors’ reassessment
of sovereign risks more generally. A materialization of this risk could lead to capital flow
reversals from emerging markets (including Mexico), reduction of market access, and a sharp
increase in the volatility of asset prices. A protracted period of financial market instability
could also affect the confidence of long-term investors, lead to lower-than-expected FDI
inflows, and slow the implementation of structural reforms.
Domestic risks. Domestic risks are mostly on the upside in the near term: business and
consumer confidence may recover faster than expected, boosting domestic demand. In the
medium term, the main risks relate to the implementation of structural reforms and their
effect on growth.

12.
Staff and the authorities concurred that, while Mexico’s integration in global financial
markets confers important benefits, it also increases exposure to external shocks. Gross capital
inflows have increased significantly in recent years, particularly portfolio inflows. Foreigners now
hold 37 percent of all local-currency public debt (and about 55 percent of the most liquid segment
of local-currency denominated sovereign bonds, Mbonos, and short-term paper, Cetes). The rise of
foreign participation in the local market has helped reduce funding costs for both the government
and corporations, providing an impulse to growth. Nonetheless, staff analysis suggests that foreign
mutual funds active in Mexico have been somewhat more prone to herding behavior during past
episodes of market stress than domestic investors (Box 6).6 Shifts in investors’ portfolios could
induce heightened volatility in asset prices.
13.
Nonetheless, Mexico’s credible policy frameworks and adequate buffers strengthen its
resilience and ability to deal with financial market stress. There was agreement that Mexico’s

bright growth prospects and prudent macroeconomic policies would help sustain investor
confidence. The authorities reiterated that Mexico is fully committed to maintaining strong policy
frameworks, including a flexible exchange rate and an open capital account, a credible inflation
targeting regime, and fiscal discipline underpinned by the Fiscal Responsibility Law. In case of
renewed bouts of volatility in financial markets, exchange rate flexibility will continue to act as an
effective shock absorber. Staff agreed that foreign exchange intervention, liquidity provision, and
debt duration management strategies would remain useful tools in cases of significant currency
overshooting or dysfunctional market conditions. The current level of reserves (about
US$190 billion) can provide a buffer against temporary stress in foreign exchange markets. The FCL
arrangement is an important complement to the country’s buffers, providing insurance against tail
risks. The authorities also highlighted their continued efforts to encourage the development of
financial markets and provide a broad range of instruments to allow investors to hedge exchange
and interest rate risks, which should reduce incentives to disinvest from Mexican assets.

C. Monetary Policy
14.
The stance of monetary policy remains appropriate. Despite the increase in headline
inflation driven by temporary factors, the annualized quarter-on-quarter growth of core prices has
remained stable around 3 percent and

15.
Staff noted that risks to the inflation outlook are mostly on the upside. Slack in the
economy may diminish faster than expected. In addition, an eventual increase in the minimum wage
could affect wages more broadly, putting upward pressure on prices.7 The central bank reaffirmed
its commitment to adjust the policy rate as needed to keep inflation in line with the target.
Following some temporary shocks, the authorities expected inflation to converge to the 3 percent
target by mid-2015, in the absence of second round effects arising from the adjustment in relative
prices and in view of the current slack in the economy. Nevertheless, going forward they expected
7

There have been proposals to raise the minimum wage up to 20 percent. A commission has been formed to
consider the economic implications of a significant increase in the minimum wage. The commission will announce
their official proposal in 2015. Meanwhile, bills have been submitted to Congress detailing plans to de-index various
contracts (including social security and Infonavit mortgages) that are currently linked to the minimum wage.

the output gap to close as the ongoing economic recovery takes hold. They also noted that the
credibility of the inflation targeting regime has brought important benefits, including greater
stability of inflation expectations, lower exchange rate pass-through, and a reduction in inflation risk
premia that have implied more degrees of freedom for monetary policy implementation.

D. Strengthening the Fiscal Framework
16.
The 2015 budget proposal implies a mild withdrawal of fiscal stimulus next year. In the
budget proposal sent to Congress in September, the fiscal deficit in 2015 is projected to narrow
slightly relative to 2014 (from 4.2 to 4.0 percent of GDP). The consolidation is smaller than envisaged
in last year’s medium-term budget projections, reflecting the authorities’ decision to accommodate
a decline in oil revenues of ½ percentage point of GDP. This decline is expected to be temporary as
the energy reform is designed to stimulate oil production in the medium term. Improvements in the
structural balance and the non-oil fiscal balance imply a mild tightening of the fiscal stance in 2015,
with spending projected to decline as a share of GDP. Staff supported the decision to accommodate
the temporary decline in oil production, while cautioning against further delays in consolidation
plans.
17.
Staff strongly supported the authorities’ intention to reduce the fiscal deficit gradually
over the next four years. The 2015 budget projects a reduction of the public sector borrowing
requirement from 4 to 2½ percent of GDP over 2015–18, which will help stabilize gross public debt
at about 49 percent of GDP and put it on a downward path thereafter. The consolidation relies on a
gradual increase in tax revenues related to the 2014 tax reform. The reform has been very effective
in improving tax collection and creating incentives for small enterprises to join the formal sector,
resulting in greater-than-expected tax revenue in 2014. Further increases in the tax intake from
newly formalized enterprises and income from an implicit excise tax on gasoline are expected to
raise non-oil tax revenues by additional 1¾ percentage points of GDP by 2018.8 Expenditure is
projected to remain broadly stable in percent of GDP in the medium term, which implies a
compression of the wage bill to compensate for rising pension expenditure. The consolidation plan
is consistent with past staff advice as it broadens the tax base and prevents cuts in capital
expenditure.
18.
Strong commitment to fiscal prudence will help maintain investor confidence and
keep financing costs low. In that context, staff emphasized that it will be important to adhere to
the announced medium-term fiscal path, and adjust policies if needed. The fiscal projections assume
that the oil production of PEMEX will stabilize at 2.4 million barrels per day starting in 2015, and that
production by private companies will commence in 2016 and increase steadily thereafter. Total oil
output is expected to reach 3 million barrels per day by 2019, but there are significant downside

risks.9 Staff and the authorities agreed that, if production levels continue to surprise on the
downside, it will be necessary to adjust expenditure or raise non-oil revenues to prevent a trend
increase in public debt. Measures would also be needed in the case of persistent shortfalls in tax
revenues relative to current projections.
19.
Amendments to the Fiscal Responsibility Law, approved by Congress in 2014,
strengthen the fiscal framework in several ways. First, the public sector borrowing requirement
(PSBR), which is a broader measure of the public sector balance than the “traditional balance”, was
made an official target for fiscal policy. Second, current structural expenditure in real terms would be
capped at 2 percent per year in 2015–16, and at the rate of potential output growth thereafter.10
Finally, a new sovereign Oil Stabilization and Savings Fund was created to manage oil revenues.
PEMEX and the private oil companies will transfer to the fund all government dues including profit
sharing, royalties, and license fees (except for the corporate income tax which is paid directly to the
central government). In turn, the fund will transfer up to 4.7 percent of GDP to the central
government every year (equivalent to the amount of oil revenues in percent of GDP in 2013).
Revenues in excess of that will be saved in the fund until the balance grows to 3 percent of GDP.11
Staff welcomed the creation of the new fund, noting that it will provide greater stability in oil
revenues for budget purposes, and will ensure that a large share of any future oil income windfall
would be saved.
20.
Staff recommended several further improvements to the framework to enhance fiscal
discipline:


It will be important to strengthen the budget approval and execution process to enforce
more strictly expenditure appropriation limits set in the budget. In the past, positive growth
and revenue surprises have not translated into an improved fiscal position because of
expenditure overruns in the execution phase (actual expenditure has exceeded budget plans
in each of the past 5 years). Going forward, any higher-than-expected oil revenues will be
saved in the new sovereign wealth fund. Therefore, more realistic budgeting of expenditure,
combined with stricter controls on execution, will be needed to ensure that limits on the

9

The baseline assumption for oil production implies that the proven reserve replacement rate rises to an average of
159 percent during 2016–19, significantly above the reported average replacement rate for PEMEX of 90 percent in
the period 2010–13. In a selected issues paper, IMF staff shows an illustrative downside scenario with production
4½ percent below the baseline on average between 2016 and 2019. Such a scenario will result in a fiscal deficit gap
of about ½ percent of GDP by 2019 relative to the current baseline.
10

Structural current expenditure, comprising about 50 percent of total public expenditure, is defined as indirect
capital spending plus current spending minus pensions, electricity subsidies, transfers to states and municipalities
from oil revenue-sharing agreements, and interest payments. It also excludes the expenditures of Pemex and the
state electricity company.
11

After this balance is reached, 40 percent of any additional surplus income will continue to be saved and the rest
will be earmarked for various spending categories (10 percent for the universal pension system, 10 percent for
research and development and renewable energy projects, 30 percent for infrastructure and oil-related investment,
and 10 percent for scholarships and regional development). Once the sovereign wealth fund reaches 10 percent of
GDP, the return on investments will be transferred to the federal government, in addition to the 4.7 percent of GDP.

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MEXICO

growth of spending are respected and that PSBR deficit targets will be met.12 The authorities
agreed that stricter control of expenditure is desirable, while noting that, given the cap on
current expenditure, in the future positive revenue surprises could only be used to increase
capital spending (within the limits of the PSBR target).


There was agreement that the escape clause to both deficit targets envisaged in the Fiscal
Responsibility Law should be invoked only in the case of a growth slowdown, and that deficit
levels should be in line with the estimated output gap. Monetary policy is better-suited to
respond to mild cyclical fluctuations. Staff suggested that stronger independent assessment
of fiscal policy could also be beneficial. A first step in that direction could be to outsource
the calculation of potential output growth and the output gap to an independent group of
experts. The authorities explained that they have just published the methodology for
calculating potential output growth (the average of actual growth for the last ten years and
growth projections for the next five years), which increases transparency and results in a
relatively conservative estimate of potential growth.



Public communication strategies should aim to promote better understanding of the fiscal
framework. Fiscal analysis and reporting will have to start giving more emphasis to the PSBR
and the current expenditure targets. Staff welcomed the effort to compile and report
historical fiscal data in accordance with international standards (GFSM 2001) in the 2015
budget, and encouraged the authorities to report the fiscal projections in line with these
standards as well.

21.
The greater independence granted to PEMEX and the Federal Electricity Company
(CFE) should help improve the efficiency of their operations. As part of the energy reform, the
two large state enterprises will have greater operational independence starting in 2015, including
more freedom in investment and operational decisions. They will be governed by Boards that will
include representatives of the government as well as independent experts. Their tax regime will be
aligned with the tax regime of private oil companies. The federal government has agreed to assume
a share of the pension liabilities of PEMEX and CFE, if they reform their pension systems to reduce
the net present value of future liabilities. Staff supported this plan, which is in line with past IMF
advice, and noted that a gradual move to a defined-contribution pension for the two public
companies would align their pension system with that of federal government employees.
22.
There was agreement that the monitoring and control of state and municipal
government finances need to be strengthened. Several highly-indebted states and municipalities
have had to restructure their obligations in recent years. Although total subnational government
debt is relatively modest at about 3 percent of GDP, deficits and debt have increased notably since
2008. Moreover, the reported debt understates the overall liabilities of subnational governments as
12

A technical assistance mission by the IMF’s Fiscal Affairs Department in April 2014 suggested the introduction of a
formal approval process for authorizing significant mid-year changes in the expenditure envelope to enforce
compliance with budget appropriations.

it excludes credit from private sector providers of goods and services. Staff welcomed the
introduction of a uniform accounting methodology (set in the General Government Accounting Law)
for states’ and municipalities’ finances. Several states have already adopted the new methodology,
and the rest are expected to do so by the end of 2015. Staff suggested that the reported data
should be audited, consolidated, and made publicly available to provide better information on local
government finances. It would also be desirable to adopt a more formal fiscal framework to
constrain the deficits of local governments, along the lines of the Fiscal Responsibility Law for the
federal government. The authorities agreed and responded that a law on local government finances
(Ley Nacional de Responsabilidad Hacendaria y Deuda Pública), which aims to address most of the
above issues, has been sent to Congress last year. Finally, staff noted that the pension system for
state employees should also be reformed to reduce unfunded liabilities.

E. Financial Sector Stability
23.
Mexico’s commercial banks remain well capitalized and profitable. Bank capital levels
are well in excess of minimum Basel III requirements (Figure 6 and Table 6). The share of nonperforming loans (NPLs) in total loans has stabilized, reaching 3¼ percent as of June from
2½ percent in 2012. The increase reflected mostly a rise in impaired loans in the construction sector.

Supervision. Credit growth is expected to recover as economic activity accelerates. The authorities
noted that ongoing stress tests—conducted by the bank supervisory authority (CNBV)—show that
banks are expected to remain solvent under adverse economic scenarios, and that sensitivity to
changes in interest rates is limited.
24.
The non-bank financial sector is also sound. Pension funds, which are the most important
player in local financial markets with assets of about 13 percent of GDP, maintain a conservative
investment profile. Insurance companies, which hold assets of about 6 percent of GDP, are getting
ready to adopt the Solvency II regime in 2015. Simulations done by the insurance regulator suggest
that all insurance companies will satisfy comfortably the capital requirements under the new regime.
Currently, capital in the insurance sector exceeds the minimum capital guarantee requirement by
75 percent, and the technical reserve requirement by 10 percent. Real estate investment trusts
(FIBRAs) have grown in importance since 2011, and now have assets equivalent to about 1½ percent

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MEXICO

of GDP. The FIBRAs are mostly funded by equity, accounting for more than a third of funds raised in
the domestic equity market in 2013. Staff welcomed the recent introduction of leverage limits and
liquidity requirements for the FIBRAs to limit risks.
25.
Corporate balance sheets appear to be resilient, though there has been some increase
in leverage since 2008. Companies have taken advantage of easy global financing conditions in
recent years to issue new bonds, particularly in external markets (Figure 7). The goal has been mainly
to reduce financing costs and extend debt maturities. However, leverage and the share of debt
denominated in foreign currency have also increased, especially in 2013. This could increase
vulnerability to changes in exchange rates or global interest rates, particularly for companies without
adequate natural or financial hedges. In addition, bond issuance by firms with low credit ratings
have also increased in recent years. Staff emphasized that it will be important to continue to
improve the collection and analysis of data on firms’ foreign exchange exposures, including through
derivatives.
26.
With respect to the more active role of development banks, staff noted that care
should be taken to avoid competition with commercial banks or undue relaxation of credit
standards. Public development banks, which in recent years have had a very conservative
investment policy, have been given a more active role in the provision of financial services in the
context of efforts to improve financial inclusion and competition in the banking sector. They extend
both direct loans to customers and subsidized guarantees for SME lending by commercial banks.13
Development banks are subject to the same regulation and supervision as commercial banks (on
their lending activities). At the same time, they are also overseen by the government (on compliance
with procurement rules and public policy). Staff noted that the more active role these banks will play
in reaching out to underserved customers is welcome, though caution should be taken to avoid
deterioration in credit quality or direct competition with commercial banks. Staff emphasized that
lending to subnational governments should be limited to projects with a clear developmental goal.
The authorities responded that the risk that development banks could crowd out private lending is
limited, since they are more active in market segments that tend to be underserved by commercial
banks. They noted that the goal of entering a particular niche is to address market failures, including
lack of competition in the provision of banking services.14
27.
Staff welcomed progress on the implementation of the financial sector reform,
including improvements to the bank resolution framework. The reform has enhanced the
collection of credit information for individuals and businesses through extending reporting
requirements to the credit bureaus to a wider set of entities. Staff noted that it will be important to
ensure equal access to this information by all credit providers. In addition, the legal framework for
13

The guarantees are priced through an auction process and have a very small subsidy component; therefore fiscal
contingent liabilities are small.
14

The 2011 FSAP found that the Mexican development banks played an important countercyclical role in response to
the credit crunch prompted by the global financial crisis, but recommended reducing their balance sheets in an
upturn, to prevent competition with commercial banks.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

MEXICO

bank resolution has been strengthened in line with the 2011 FSAP recommendations (see Annex II).
Another important aspect of the reform was the easing of legal hurdles for banks to repossess
collateral through the creation of specialized federal courts. For the system to function effectively,
sufficient funding needs to be made available for the new courts. The reform also gives new powers
to the supervisors to evaluate bank credit expansion. Staff warned that these powers should be
exercised judiciously to prevent misallocation of resources.
28.
Important steps have been taken to improve the regulation and supervision of large
financial groups. The Financial Group Act was amended in January 2014, setting out new regulatory
guidelines for consolidated supervision. Going forward, financial conglomerates will be overseen by
a committee including all relevant supervisors. One of the supervisors will be designated as a lead
supervisor in charge of monitoring financial accounts, activities, and risks at the group level.
29.
The effects of international financial regulatory reforms on Mexico have been
manageable so far. Over the next five years, commercial banks will phase in the Basel III minimum
liquidity coverage ratio. Other reform initiatives with potential impact on Mexico are still in the
process of discussion by international bodies. Staff noted that the upgrading of reporting
requirements for foreign exchange operators, wire services, and unregulated SOFOMES, should
strengthen anti-money laundering efforts. The authorities were concerned that as foreign banks
decide to opt-out of cross-border transactions, including remittances, as part of de-risking decisions
taken in response to stringent requirements imposed by regulators in connection with AML/CFT
procedures, facilities available to Mexican banks to carry out such transactions will be more limited.
They expressed hope that as banks involved in such transactions, with the support of the competent
financial authorities, are able to establish clear compliance procedures, the restrictions will be
alleviated.

STAFF APPRAISAL
30.
Mexico’s macroeconomic policies and policy frameworks remain very strong. Monetary
policy is guided by an inflation targeting framework in the context of a flexible exchange regime and
fiscal policy is anchored by the fiscal responsibility law. The authorities remain committed to an
open capital account and continuous development and deepening of financial markets. The external
position is in line with economic fundamentals and desirable policy settings.
31.
Mexico has made impressive progress in advancing its structural reform agenda.
Mexico is one of very few countries that have succeeded in achieving political consensus to tackle
long-standing challenges in many critical areas such as energy, education, telecommunications, and
labor. The recent approval of secondary legislation for the energy reform will transform the
hydrocarbons sector by opening the door to private investment in oil and gas production and
distribution, and liberalizing the electricity sector. The reforms should boost productivity and output
growth over the medium term. Going forward, strong implementation is critical for the reforms to
yield these benefits.

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

32.
After a few quarters of slow growth, economic activity has rebounded on the back of
strong external demand. Real GDP is projected to grow at 2½ percent in 2014, and to reach
3½ percent in 2015. The U. S. recovery has provided a boost to manufacturing and related services,
and construction activity is gathering pace supported by the pickup of government infrastructure
spending.
33.
As a highly open economy, Mexico remains susceptible to stress in global financial
markets. A surge in financial market volatility, triggered for example by a disorderly normalization
of U.S. monetary policy, could lead to a reversal of capital flows and an increase in risk premia.
Nonetheless, Mexico’s strong fundamentals, deep and liquid financial markets, and substantial
reserve buffers should help it weather well a rise in volatility. The flexible exchange rate will continue
to facilitate adjustment to shocks. Rules-based foreign exchange intervention and liquidity support
would be useful tools in case of market dysfunction. Finally, the FCL arrangement provides valuable
insurance against tail risks.
34.
Monetary policy will remain geared toward reaching the inflation target. The current
accommodative stance is appropriate as the economy is still operating below potential, and inflation
pressures are contained. Headline inflation is projected to decline toward the target in 2015, as taxrelated base effects dissipate and administered price increases moderate. With spare capacity
expected to diminish gradually in the coming quarters, pressures on wages and prices need to be
monitored carefully.
35.
Further improvements in budget implementations practices would help increase the
effectiveness of the new fiscal framework. The new Fiscal Responsibility Law strengthens the
fiscal framework in important ways. It provides clear fiscal targets, consistent with a sustainable path
for public debt. More realistic budgeting of expenditure, combined with stricter control on spending
execution, will help ensure that PSBR and expenditure targets will be met. Progress on reporting
public sector fiscal data in line with international accounting standards is welcome.
36.
Staff strongly supports the authorities’ plans to reduce the PSBR to 2.5 percent of GDP
by 2018. The planned consolidation will help stabilize public debt and put it on a downward path.
Strong fiscal discipline will help maintain investors’ confidence, enhancing Mexico’s resilience to
external shocks, and would allow the government to cope better with long-term fiscal challenges
related to population aging. Strict adherence to the announced fiscal path will strengthen the
credibility of the new fiscal framework. If medium-term projections for oil production turn out to be
on the optimistic side, resulting in persistent revenue shortfalls, measures should be taken to ensure
that PSBR deficit targets will be met. In the spirit of the escape clauses in the Fiscal Responsibility
Law, discretionary fiscal stimulus should be considered only in the case of a sharp decline in
economic activity. Plans to reform the pension system for the two large state-owned companies
(PEMEX and CFE) are welcome. The reform has the potential to reduce the net present value of
future liabilities for the public sector.
37.
The monitoring and control of state and municipal financing need to be strengthened.
A full adoption of the uniform accounting methodology for the reporting of local government

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

MEXICO

finances would be an important first step. The reported data should be audited, consolidated, and
made publicly available to facilitate analysis of state and municipal finances. It would also be
advisable to introduce a formal legal framework to anchor fiscal policy-making at the local level,
similar to the FRL for the federal government. The pension system for state employees should be
reformed to align it with that for federal employees.
38.
The balance sheets of banks and non-bank financial intermediaries remain strong.
Banks maintain high levels of liquidity and capital buffers and follow conservative lending practices.
Corporate and household balance sheets also appear to be sound, though the rise in foreign
exchange borrowing among some large companies needs to be monitored carefully. Insurance
companies are also well capitalized and profitable. The progress in strengthening the regulation and
consolidated supervision of large financial conglomerates is commendable. The increased role of
development banks in improving financial inclusion and providing credit to underserved sectors is
welcome, though caution is needed to avoid displacement of private bank lending or a significant
relaxation of credit standards.
39.
It is proposed that the next Article IV Consultation with Mexico take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

Box 1. External Sector Assessment
Mexico’s external sector position is broadly consistent with medium-term fundamentals and desirable
policies. The current account deficit widened to 2.1 percent of GDP in 2013, reflecting higher net factor
payments (including higher interest payments, greater profit repatriation, and a rise in reinvested earnings),
while the trade balance remained stable (Figure 4). According to the 2014 Pilot External Sector Report, the
cyclically-adjusted current account deficit is 0.2 percentage points of GDP narrower than the norm
consistent with fundamentals, calculated using the External Balance Assessment model (Annex I). The
nominal exchange rate has remained relatively stable in 2014, and the implied exchange rate volatility from
option prices has fallen to historical lows. The real effective exchange rate is assessed to be slightly
undervalued (with a range of 0 to 10 percent undervaluation). External competitiveness remains strong.
Mexico’s share in U.S. manufacturing imports has increased from 10 to 13 percent over the last five years,
and unit labor costs in manufacturing have declined.
Mexico has seen a surge in capital inflows since 2010, when it was included in Citigroup’s World Government
Bond Index. Favorable global financing conditions have played a role as a “push” factor, though “pull”
factors have also been important. Mexico remains an attractive destination for investors due to its strong
medium-term growth prospects, open and liquid capital markets, and predictable policies. Going forward,
most of the growth in inflows is expected to come from FDI into energy exploration and
telecommunications.
The net international investment liability position
has remained stable at about 40 percent of GDP.
Capital inflows since 2010 have not translated
into external or domestic imbalances, as the
accumulation of gross external liabilities has
been matched by a rise in external asset holdings
(residents’ foreign assets stood at 45 percent of
GDP in June 2014).

markets. The accumulation of reserves reflects
the net balance of the foreign exchange operations of PEMEX (the state-owned energy company) and the
government, which are handled through accounts in the central bank. Mexico has maintained broadly stable
measures of reserve adequacy over time (Table 6). Specifically, net international reserves in terms of months
of imports and in percent of broad money have been stable or rising. However, as foreign holdings of
domestic debt increased rapidly, reserves have declined as a share of foreign portfolio liabilities and
particularly as a share of short-term external debt by residual maturity. Foreign exchange reserves amounted
to 116 percent on the ARA metric in 2013.

Box 2. Recent Developments in Residential Construction and Government
Housing Policies in Mexico
The construction sector has been a key drag on growth
over the last two years. Since entering a downturn in
mid-2012, construction activity (which accounts for
7 percent of GDP) has contracted by 6½ percent. The
decline was most pronounced in low-income housing
construction. Construction employment also fell sharply,
affecting consumer confidence, and spilling over to the
rest of the economy.
Poor financial choices of the largest private homebuilders
and changes in homeowner’s location preferences led to
a collapse in private residential investment. Between 2001
and 2011, the three largest developers in Mexico (GEO,
HOMEX and URBI) took on heavy debt to build sprawls
of low-rise houses in the city suburbs, fueled by
government mortgage credit and subsidies that favored
affordable single homes for low-income people. But the
homes were built far away from jobs in city centers, and
in areas that lacked the basic infrastructure, services, and
amenities. Stuck in poor locations, many residents
eventually abandoned their homes, moving to urban
areas in search for better access to public services and
lower commuting costs. Having over-spent on big outof-town developments where Mexicans no longer
wanted to live, and facing large debt obligations, the
large homebuilders were cut-off from bank credit,
bringing residential construction to a halt. The
bankruptcy of the large homebuilders rippled through
the rest of the sector, as commercial banks retrenched
from credit to other construction firms.

its lending policy toward the purchase of existing—rather than new—houses. Hard hit from the new housing
policies, all three homebuilders filed for bankruptcy in mid-2013.

In an effort to stimulate lending, in March 2013, the government announced guarantees for construction
loans made by commercial banks to the country’s homebuilders. In addition, Infonavit announced in July
2014 that it would broaden access to home mortgages by increasing the maximum amount it can lend to
prospective home buyers by 76 percent and extending maturities of its mortgages. As a result of these
measures, residential construction activity has started to recover in recent months, with a strong pickup in
formal employment in the sector.

The deterioration in business sentiment coincided with a weakening economy and with the initial period of
discussion and adoption of a number of structural reforms. A plausible hypothesis is that a rise in
uncertainty related to weaker growth and to the likely effects of the reforms may have contributed to the
turn in sentiment. While the reforms laid the foundations for higher medium-term growth, in the initial
stages, policy and regulatory uncertainty, particularly related to reforms in the fiscal, telecom, and antitrust
areas, could have had adverse effects on economic activity.1 Faced with an uncertain tax and investment
climate, companies may choose to delay costly commitments that are hard to reverse, waiting for the final
regulations to clarify the new rules. The negative sentiment could have affected particularly dominant firms
in oligopolistic sectors as their market power was about to be contested in the context of the antitrust and
telecom reforms.
Regression analysis suggests that: (i) firms in more concentrated sectors may tend to invest less on average;
and (ii) deterioration in sentiment appears to be associated with larger decreases in investment rates for
firms operating in less competitive industries. The analysis cannot distinguish among the different reasons
for the deterioration in business sentiment. Even if uncertainty associated with the reforms was behind the
deterioration in 2013 and early 2014, it has clearly dissipated after the approval of important secondary
legislation, with investment intentions turning positive in recent months. In addition, the antitrust and
telecom reforms aim at enhancing competition in concentrated industries, which should also give an
impetus to investment.

______________________________
1/
A large body of research, starting with Bernanke (1983), suggests that uncertainty has negative, measurable effects on
corporate investment. Gulen and Ion (2013) estimate that about two-thirds of the 32 percent plunge in corporate
investments in the U.S. during the 2007–10 crisis period was attributable to policy-related uncertainty.

Box 4. Structural Reforms
In less than 2 years, Mexico has enacted an impressive number of structural reforms covering energy,
telecommunications, labor markets, antitrust legislation, financial, education, and the fiscal sector. In
addition, an important political reform was adopted. The complexity of the enacted reforms makes it difficult
to come up with precise calculations of their impact on growth. Staff estimates of the effect of the reforms
over the medium term suggest an increase in potential growth of about 0.75 to 0.9 percentage points to
reach 3½–4 percent over 2016–19 (compared to an estimated potential growth of 2¾–3 percent in 2014).
Synergies among reforms could yield additional benefits, which are difficult to quantify at this juncture.
Energy reform
The reform opens the energy sector to private investment. The reform amended the constitution to end
a 75-year old state monopoly in the oil and gas sector, and allows the state to enter into a wide range of
risk-sharing contracts with the private sector—from production-sharing to licenses. The reform also
increases the autonomy of PEMEX and CFE (the state-owned electricity company), which could help raise
their productivity and efficiency. In addition, the reform encourages greater private participation in electricity
generation and natural gas distribution, and improves the regulation and management of transmission and
distribution.
Impact on growth: Three channels are considered: i) higher oil and gas production, relative to a baseline of
constant production levels, ii) a boost to manufacturing production through lower electricity prices , and iii)
additional value added from higher investment in related services (Annex 3). Staff estimates a cumulative
growth by 2019 of about 1.4 percent, 0.6 percent, and 0.5 percent respectively due to each channel, which
implies about 0.6 percentage point increase in growth on average per year over 2016–19.
Financial reform
The reform aims to increase financial deepening by promoting competition and streamlining
bankruptcy procedures. Specifically, the reform introduces new provisions for credit and checking account
portability, allowing clients to switch banks more easily. It also strengthens the legal framework for
consumer protection. Furthermore, the reform strengthens creditors’ rights by creating specialized courts to
allow for faster processing of collateral in case of default. The reform also increases the role of development
banks in extending credit and credit guarantees to underserved sectors, including SMEs and small
agriculture producers.
Impact on growth: Since 2007, financial deepening in Mexico, measured by the ratio of total domestic
credit to the non-financial private sector to GDP, has increased at a rate of about 0.7 percentage points
annually. Staff’s baseline scenario assumes the pace accelerates to 1.5 percentage points of GDP starting in
2016. This implies closing the gap in domestic credit to the private sector between Mexico and the median
for emerging countries in Latin America in about 12 years. Using coefficients found in the literature on the
link between financial development and growth, staff estimates that this additional deepening could lead to
0.07 and 0.16 percentage points of additional growth per year over 2016–19.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21

MEXICO

Box 4. Structural Reforms (Concluded)
Telecommunication reform
The goal of the telecommunication reform is to increase competition and improve access to services.
The reform created a new independent regulatory agency, Instituto Federal de Telecomunicaciones (IFETEL),
and charged it with regulating broadcasting and telecommunications. IFETEL will have the power to impose
asymmetric regulations on any dominant players in the telecom or broadcasting sectors in order to increase
competition. The reform also opens the sector to foreign investment and creates specialized courts in
broadcasting, telecommunications and economic competition matters. The reform also launched a major
investment program to increase internet connectivity, with the goal of bringing internet connections to the
whole territory of the country by 2018.
Impact on growth: To gauge the impact of the reform, Mexico is compared to the OECD average in terms
of access to broadband internet. If the reform succeeds in closing ¼ of the gap, real GDP would rise by 0.41
to 0.79 percentage point, based on elasticities found in the literature (Koutroumpis, 2009, The economic
impact of broadband on growth: a simultaneous approach, Telecommunications Policy, Vol. 33). Assuming
that the effect is evenly distributed over the next 5 years, the annual output growth rate would increase by
0.08–0.16 percentage points. The increase of fixed line phones and any price reductions in telephone and
internet services would also be positive for growth, but the effects would be relatively small.
Other reforms
The growth effects of reforms in other areas, including labor, education, and antitrust are more difficult to
quantify as they may take time to materialize, and because the main impact may come from synergies with
other reforms. For instance, antitrust legislation is likely to play a crucial role in ensuring an efficient opening
of various sectors to private investment. Similarly, more flexible labor markets may make it more attractive to
foreign investors to invest in the telecom and energy sectors. The education reform introduces a competitive
process for teaching appointments, and standardized evaluations and merit-based promotions for teachers.
The reform should raise the quality of the public education system and, if well implemented, would help
increase human capital and productivity in the long run, while improving the efficiency of public spending.

Box 5. Spillovers from United States
Mexico has close ties to the global economy, and particularly to the United States. Mexico’s manufacturing
sector is highly integrated into the U.S. supply chain, with 80 percent of good exports going to the United
States. The U.S. also accounts for over half of Mexico’s foreign portfolio liabilities and foreign direct
investment. Foreign-owned banks account for about 70 percent of banking system assets, with a large
presence of Spanish banks. There has been a sizable increase in portfolio inflows into the domestic
sovereign bond market since the inclusion of Mexico in the World Global Bond Index (WGBI) in 2010. Based
on BIS data, the Mexican peso is the most actively traded emerging market currency in the world, with a
daily global trading volume of US$135 billion. International investors now hold 37 percent of local currency
denominated sovereign bonds, and 52 percent of total public debt, exposing Mexico to abrupt changes in
investor sentiment.
An orderly normalization of U.S. monetary policy, accompanied by stronger U.S growth would be positive for
Mexico as the increase in trade and remittances will lift growth. The correlation between U.S. and Mexico’s

2013, despite its strong fundamentals. As investors started to differentiate among countries based on
fundamentals, spreads on Mexico’s securities declined.

Box 6. Does Investor Behavior Amplify Volatile Capital Flows in Mexico?
Foreign investors’ exposure to Mexican financial assets has risen rapidly over the last decade, while the
domestic investor base has steadily expanded and diversified. Staff analysis investigates how the volatility of
gross capital flows in Mexico has been affected by the behavior of foreign and domestic investors during
periods of market stress. Specifically, using available aggregate and fund-level data, this study (i) identifies
extreme capital flow episodes in Mexico following the methodology developed by Forbes and Warnock
(2012); (ii) examines the role of foreign and domestic investors (banks, pension and insurance funds, mutual
funds) in amplifying or mitigating global shocks to 10-year Mbonos market during these episodes; and
(iii) assesses whether local and global mutual funds active in Mexico behaved differently during periods of
market stress.
The main findings are as follows:


We found strong evidence of herding and
positive-feedback trading behavior among global
bond funds active in Mexico, especially during
market stress, which have contributed to the
volatility of capital flows and can exacerbate tail
events. Herding and positive trading behavior was
also observed among domestic bond funds, though
to a lesser degree than their foreign counterparts.
These findings have important implications for policy
responses to volatile capital flows:


OLS regressions and multivariate
GARCH models suggest that foreign
participation tended to amplify the impact of
global financial shocks—measured by changes
in the Vix or U.S. sovereign bond yields—on the
volatility of Mexican sovereign bond yields,
more so during periods of market stress.
Domestic investors played some mitigating
role, but the empirical evidence was mixed,
depending on the type of investors and
whether the global shock was an increase in
the Vix or in U.S. sovereign bond yields.

Net Capital Flows

Policy credibility will continue to be key, anchored by
effective policy communication. A deep and diverse domestic investor base can help mitigate the effects of
global shocks by absorbing excess supply of domestic assets in the face of a drop in demand by nonresident investors. In the context of ongoing regulatory reforms in the pension sector, the authorities should
avoid regulations that could induce herding behavior among fund managers. At the same time, the
insurance provided by the FCL remains important to maintain market confidence at times of stress.

Adjustments to Traditional balance 12/

Sources: Mexico authorities; and Fund staff estimates and projections.
1/ Data exclude state and local governments, and includes state-owned enterprises and public development banks.
2/ Revenue and expenditure figures differ from official data due to differences in the treatment of the subsidy excise on gasoline, which is included here as expense
(subsidies).
3/ Interest payments differ from official data due to adjustments to account for changes in valuation and interest rates.
4/ Includes revenue sharing between federal government and state and local governments.
5/ Includes Adefas and other expenses, as well as the adjustments to the "traditional" balance not classified elsewhere.
6/ This category differ from official data on physical capital spending due to adjustment to account for Pidiregas amortizations included in budget figures.
7/ Represents the change in public sector net worth due to transactions; calculated as revenue minus expense (i.e., excluding net acquisition of non-financial assets).
8/ This balancing item is equivalent to the public sector borrowing requirements (PSBR) as defined by Mexican authorities, except for the adjustment to net inflows
of stabilization funds.
9/ Negative of the change in the structural primary fiscal balance, measured adjusting tax revenue for the cycle and oil net exports using a long-term moving average
of oil prices.
10/ Corresponds to the gross stock of public sector borrowing requirements. It is calculated as gross debt, as published by the authorities, plus adjustments to
reflect additional public sector's liabilities not included in the headline official figures.
11/ Corresponds to the net stock of public sector borrowing requirements (i.e., net of public sector financial assets) as published by the authorities.
12/ Includes: Pidiregas, IPAB, budgetary adjustments, net inflows of stabilization funds, FARAC/FONADIN, debtor support, change in capital of development banks,
and nonrecurring revenue.
13/ The 2014 amendment to the FRL introduced a cap on structural current spending real growth. The latter is defined as total budgeary expenditure, excluding: (i)
interest payments; (ii) non-programable spending; (iii) fuel costs of CFE; and (iv) direct physical and financial investment of the federal government.
14/ The cap on structural current spending real growth was set at 2.0 percent for 2015 and 2016, and equal to potential GDP real growht from 2017 onwards.

Annex I. External Sustainability Assessment
Mexico
Foreign asset
and liability
position and
trajectory

Overall Assessment

Background. Mexico’s NIIP is about -39 percent of GDP (gross foreign assets and liabilities are roughly 45 percent and
84 percent of GDP, respectively). Foreign-held portfolio liabilities are about 40 percent of GDP, of which around one third
are holdings of local-currency government bonds. With projected current account deficits averaging less than 2.5
percent of GDP, the NIIP to GDP ratio is projected to remain broadly stable over the medium term.
Assessment. While the NIIP is sustainable, gross foreign portfolio liabilities could be a channel of vulnerability to global
financial volatility, especially through the domestic sovereign bond market.

Current
account

Background. The current account (CA) deficit widened to 2.1 percent of GDP in 2013 (-1.7 percent cyclically adjusted),
amid larger net factor payments. In 2014, the current account deficit is projected to remain unchanged with an improving
trade balance offset by a continued increase in factor payments. The deficit is projected to rise to about 2.2 percent of
GDP, on the back of imports associated with increased FDI in the energy and telecom sectors. Investment is projected to
rise by about 3 percentage points of GDP over the medium term, supported by an increase in public and private saving.
Assessment. Mexico’s CA appears to be slightly stronger than the level consistent with medium term fundamentals and
desirable policy settings. The EBA model estimates a cyclically-adjusted current account norm of -1.9 percent, implying a
positive CA gap of +0.2 percent of GDP (including the upward influence on the CA of fiscal policies of other countries).
The staff assessment is similar, within a gap range centered on that estimate plus or minus 1 percent of GDP. The small
projected increase in Mexico’s CA deficit is consistent with fundamentals, desirable policy settings, and the expected
effects of the growth-enhancing structural reforms on FDI.

Real exchange
rate

1/

Background. The floating exchange rate has been a key shock absorber in an unsettled global environment. In 2013,
the peso became the most widely-traded emerging market currency. As such, it often serves as a port-of-call for
investors taking positions in other EM currencies with less liquid markets or capital account restrictions.
Assessment. The EBA REER regression estimates a small undervaluation of about 6 percent in 2013; this is also consistent
with the EBA estimate that the current account is slightly on the strong side. The staff assesses Mexico’s real effective
exchange rate to be broadly consistent with fundamentals and desirable policy settings (slightly undervalued with a gap
centered on -5 percent, in a range of 0 to -10 percent).
Background. Gross capital inflows by non-residents in the period following the global crisis were broadly offset by
2/
purchases of assets abroad, particularly by the resident private sector. Net capital inflows are expected to continue to
be in excess of the external current account deficit; since 2010, a large share of these flows have been purchases of
3/
locally-issued government paper and other portfolio investments by non-residents. Going forward, the structural
reforms could raise overall inflows and FDI.

Mexico’s external sector position is broadly
consistent with medium-term fundamentals
and desirable policy settings.
The staff assesses the current account as
having been only slightly on the strong
side, and correspondingly the REER to have
been slightly on the weak side. The FCL
provides an added buffer against global tail
risks.
Potential policy responses: As the
external sector position is broadly
consistent with medium-term
fundamentals, there is no reason to alter
the current and planned policy settings.
The authorities have committed to
reducing the public sector borrowing
requirement from 4.2 percent of GDP in
2014 to 2.5 percent of GDP in 2018. The
consolidation relies on a gradual increase in
tax revenues related to the 2014 tax reform.
The central bank will set monetary policy to
ensure that the inflation converges towards
the 3 percent permanent target within the
horizon at which monetary policy operates,
while maintaining a flexible exchange rate
policy.

Assessment. While the local currency denomination and long duration of sovereign debt reduces the exposure of
government finances to depreciation of the domestic currency, the presence of foreign investors leaves Mexico exposed
to a reversal of capital flows and an increase in risk premia. The authorities have refrained from capital flow management
measures, in line with their view that an open capital account reduces policy uncertainty and supports long-term growth.

MEXICO

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Annex I. External Sustainability Assessment (concluded)
Background. The central bank remains committed to a floating exchange rate, using rules-based intervention only to
prevent disorderly market conditions. The central bank did not conduct any discretionary foreign exchange intervention
in 2013 and 2014; it will continue to build its reserve buffer mostly through purchases of the net foreign currency
proceeds of the state oil company.
Assessment The current level of foreign reserves is adequate for normal times according to a range of standard reserve
coverage indicators, and falls in the lower end of the 100-150 percent range of the IMF’s composite reserve adequacy
metric. The current policy of reserve accumulation is broadly consistent with the expected gradual rise in foreign-held
portfolio liabilities. The Fund FCL arrangement has been an effective complement to international reserves against global
tail risks.
Technical
Background
Notes

1/ Following the tapering announcement by Ben Bernanke in May 21, 2013, Mexico’s currency experienced one of the
sharpest depreciations across emerging markets, falling by nearly 8.4 percent by end-June 2013. By the end of April 2014
st
it had depreciated 6 percent with respect to May 21 2013—significantly less than for other emerging market countries.
The nominal and real effective exchange rates have depreciated modestly since end-2013.

3/ In the second quarter of 2013, gross capital inflows from non-residents, especially portfolio investment, fell sharply
from a peak in the first quarter. Residents helped cushion the effects of this shift by repatriating part of their assets
invested abroad, thus leading to a smaller decline in overall net capital inflows. Portfolio inflows bounced back strongly
in the second half of 2013 and first half of 2014.

42

2/ Capital inflows by non-residents in the period after the global crisis did not lead to a significant widening of the
current account deficit. Rather, they translated (in a BOP accounting sense) into a strong accumulation of hard-currency
assets abroad, particularly by the private sector. Outward FDI, foreign bond and equity purchases, deposits abroad and
domestic banks’ loans to non-residents represented two-thirds of the economy’s foreign asset accumulation over this
period.

MEXICO

Annex II. Implementation of Key FSAP Recommendations
Short Term
Increase budget autonomy for CNBV and CNSF; increase resources commensurate with new responsibilities (wider
regulatory perimeter).
Partly implemented. The CNBV’s budget resources have risen by 10 percent a year over the last three years,
although the number of supervised entities has tripled to 5,000 over the same period.
Extend scope of CNBV regulatory and supervisory powers to financial and mixed-activity groups.
Partly implemented. The new Mexican Financial Groups Law establishes that supervision of financial groups
will be conducted on a consolidated basis by a Supervisory Commission (i.e. CNBV, CNSF or CONSAR)
appointed by the Mexican Finance Ministry (SHCP) for each financial group. The Ministry and the Supervisory
Commissions share regulation powers. The former is focused on capitalization requirements and intra-group
activities, among other aspects. The latter will implement regulations related to accountability, financial
information, and disclosure. Additionally, the banking law extends the CNBV’s supervisory and regulatory
powers to mixed-activity groups. The new framework is expected to be fully implemented by year end.
Fully implement Pillar 2 supervisory processes, including ICAAP and criteria to require buffers above regulatory
minima.
In progress. The CNBV has strengthened its powers to require credit institutions to maintain capital above the
regulatory minimum based on the credit institution’s own stress scenarios. To determine such scenarios, credit
institutions must comply with the regulations established by the CNBV, expected to be issued by year end.
Tighten concentration limits (including applicable standards) and introduce capital charge for concentration risk
under Pillar 2.
In progress. The regulation regarding capital charges for concentration risk under Pillar 2 is intended to be
implemented by year end.
Establish emergency contingency funding mechanism for IPAB, guaranteed by SHCP; transfer IPAB’s debt to the
Federal Government.
Not implemented. The authorities noted that under the current Central Bank Law, Bank of Mexico can grant
credit to IPAB without the need for any special arrangement. However, IPAB and the Bank of Mexico have to
work on a Memorandum of Understanding.
Change pension fund investment guidelines and regulatory tools to encourage focus on long term returns,
including using long-term benchmarks.
In progress. The AFOREs’ investment regime has been changed over the years to enhance medium- and longterm investment policies. Recent changes include: First, a distinction in the Net Return Index horizon
(performance measure) by fund type; second, new criteria for benchmark portfolios as well as SIEFORE’s VaR
parameters; and, finally, a new SIEFORE (SB0) specialized on workers close to retirement.
Establish program to address weak and not yet regulated cooperatives.
Implemented. Currently the cooperatives are supervised by the CNBV and subject to prudential regulation,
accounting and corporate governance rules.
Revisit the structure of commissions and ensure bank account contestability to promote access to finance.
Partly implemented. The financial reform established the joint power of Bank of Mexico and CNBV to regulate
fees and commissions related to card payments networks (regulation issued last March), ATMs, checks and
electronic transfers. A regulation networks other than card payments is expected by early 2015.

Improve legal framework for derivatives.
In progress. In May 2014, The SHCP, Bank of Mexico, and CNBV jointly issued amendments to existing
regulations aimed at strengthening and improving transparency in the derivatives market. These amendments
incorporate some of the principles for Financial Market Infrastructures published by CPSS-IOSCO. Specifically,
they aim at: 1) allowing central counterparties to clear over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives; 2) strengthening
corporate governance and risk management for central counterparties; and 3) allowing central counterparties to
offer additional services, such as trade reporting. The new rules also delineate responsibilities for the CNBV and
Bank of Mexico, which jointly oversee clearing members.
Medium Term
Enhance independence and accountability of the CNBV and CNSF (including by revisiting supervisory architecture)
and strengthen the legal protection of supervisors.
Not implemented.
Strengthen powers and increase resources at CONDUSEF and study allocation of responsibilities with PROFECO.
In progress.
Pension contribution rates for private employees should be set to achieve reasonable replacement rates at
retirement.
Not implemented.
Promote greater competition for mutual fund providers by facilitating entry by independent operators.
Implemented. The January 2014 amendment to the Mutual funds law aimed at allowing access to more market
players, in line with the recommendation. Also, the CNBV could authorize electronic platforms for the trading of
all mutual funds, in order to ease entry by independent distributors.
Promote regional integration of capital markets; prepare a medium-term strategy for capital market development.
In progress. Since August 18th 2014, Mexico has become a member of the Integrated Latin American Market
(MILA). The amendments introduced in May 30, 2013 to the securities exchanges regulations allow for
agreements between the Mexican securities exchange (BMV) and other exchanges, to facilitate access to each
other’s trading systems. The CNBV is also working together with NAFIN and BMV to promote the participation
of SME’s in capital markets.

Annex III. Growth Impact of the Energy Reform
To measure the impact of the energy reform, staff considered three components: i) the direct impact
through increases in oil and gas production, ii) the value added from foreign investment flows, and iii)
the impact on manufacturing activity through lower electricity prices.
1.
The no-reform scenario assumes constant oil and gas production while the reform
scenario factors in gradual production increases. Crude oil production remains constant at the
estimated levels for PEMEX for 2015 of 2.4 million barrels a day (see selected issues paper). The
critical assumption is that PEMEX will be able to achieve a 100 percent reserve replacement ratio so
that new discoveries and extraction technologies compensate for declining production in maturing
fields. The reform scenario assumes instead that production of oil reaches 3 million barrels a day
and natural gas 8.3 millions of cubic feet per day by 2019 as new entrants add to Pemex’s output.

2.
FDI flows starting in 2016 would include a large import component. There is large
uncertainty about the size of the import component, which staff assumes at 50 percent, since it can
vary widely depending on the type of oil field (i.e., shallow waters, deep waters, shale). Total FDI
flows are backed out from industry-based comparables of investment costs of achieving the
production scenarios (see selected issues paper). The increase in investment is not uniform across
years reflecting different phases of exploration and extraction.

3.
Substitution of fuel oil for natural gas in electricity generation would lower electricity
prices and boost manufacturing activity. Staff analysis in the companion selected issues paper
estimates an elasticity of manufacturing output to electricity prices of up to -0.28, and a potential
reduction of about 13 percent in electricity tariffs for industrial consumers. This reduction would
follow from increased availability of natural gas derived from increased gas pipeline capacity to
import natural gas from the United States, which can be used to substitute fuel oil in electricity
generation1 The estimated reduction in electricity prices and elasticity of manufacturing output to
those prices imply an impact on GDP of up to 0.6 percent, given the current weight of
manufacturing output in GDP. Staff analysis suggests that it is feasible for GDP to exhibit these gains
over the period 2016-2019. These estimates are subject to upside risks from efficiency gains in the
electricity sector that could yield further reductions in tariffs and bring them eventually to U.S. levels.

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK AND BANKFUND COLLABORATION UNDER THE JMAP
A. Relations with the World Bank
Mexico has had a longstanding partnership with the World Bank Group. The Board discussed in
December 2013 the new Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) covering FY14–19—which was jointly
prepared with the Government of Mexico. This new CPS focuses on the World Bank Group’s twin goals
(ending extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity) and is fully aligned with the Mexico's
National Development Plan (NDP) for 2013–18. It describes the Bank’s engagement with Mexico as a
partnership to achieve development results through selective and tailored packages of financial,
knowledge, and convening services. IBRD lending has remained an important part of this engagement
throughout the years.
As a member of the OECD and the G20, Mexico has maintained economic stability through times of
recent crisis, and increased economic and social well-being over the last two decades. Mexico's exposure
to the IBRD increased with the onset of the global financial crisis as lending surged to US$10.6 billion in
FY10–12. As of July 31, 2014, the World Bank’s exposure was US$15.15 billion which positioned Mexico as
the largest borrower in the world in terms of IBRD debt outstanding. The active portfolio consists of
10 IBRD projects and 7 GEF operations for a net commitment of US$1.4 billion. In FY14, the World Bank
prepared the first sub-national results-based loans to Oaxaca (US$55 million), one of the poorest states in
Mexico, which is bound to be used as a model for other states. For FY15 the pipeline includes five
operations in support of Mexico’s social protection system, the education sector and energy efficiency.
The recent increase of the Single Borrower Limit up to US$19.0 billion provided the Bank with further
financial space to support Mexico's efforts in achieving its development agenda.

B. Bank-Fund Collaboration under the JMAP
The Bank and Fund teams have discussed the following priorities:


A well-funded and effective government. Falling oil revenues and rising public spending needs
require increased tax revenue and more efficient and targeted public spending. This includes
policies that broaden the tax base, narrow special regimes or preferential rates and generate
information flows that facilitate tax compliance and boost tax revenue. Increasing transparency,
operational efficiency and progressivity of public expenditures, improving public sector
performance through better budget and financial management as well as a systemic coverage
and mitigation strategy of fiscal risks are some other areas that require additional attention.



Comprehensive reforms to boost productivity and potential output growth. To increase
productivity and assure that such gains are widespread, focus should be placed on policies and
programs that foster sound financial sector development generate a competitive business
environment, foster innovation and upgrade infrastructure. Sound financial sector development

includes continued financial sector surveillance, an area in which the latest joint Bank-Fund FSAP
took place in the second half of 2011.


Social protection. Mexico’s social security, social assistance and labor market programs face
important equity and efficiency challenges due to fragmentation, weak design and coverage
gaps. Reforms are needed to build a more inclusive, effective and integrated social protection
system that provides protections from income shocks and helps smooth consumption over the
life cycle with due attention for their impact on the labor market. In addition, measures to
increase labor productivity and wages focus on regulations (increasing the benefits of formality),
skills development and employment services.



Climate change and environmental protection. Increasing risks posed by climate change and the
cost of environmental degradation highlight the importance of efforts to reduce Mexico’s
environmental and carbon footprint of growth, including in areas such as energy efficiency and
renewable energy, water management, urban planning, solid waste and natural resource use.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision is adequate for surveillance. Mexico observes the Special Data Dissemination
Standards (SDDS) and its metadata are posted on the Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board
(DSBB). In a number of cases, the periodicity and timeliness of disseminated data exceed SDDS
requirements. A data ROSC update was completed on October 8, 2010 and was published as IMF
Country Report No. 10/330. There are various areas where improvements could be made, as detailed
below. The authorities are aware of this situation and are continuing work in this regard.
The national accounts statistics generally follow the recommendations of the System of National
Accounts, 1993 (1993 SNA). Source data and statistical techniques are sound and most statistical
outputs sufficiently portray reality. A broad range of source data are available, with economic
censuses every five years and a vast program of monthly and annual surveys. For most surveys,
scientific sampling techniques are used. Nonetheless, most samples exclude a random sample of
small enterprises. Some statistical techniques need enhancement. For example, taxes and subsidies
on products at constant prices are estimated by applying the GDP growth rate, a deviation from best
practice.
During 2014 STA conducted a reassessment of the data module of the ROSC that covered national
accounts. As compared with the 2010 ROSC, the reassessment was based on the newest (May 2012)
vintage of the Data Quality Assessment Framework (DQAF) and against those specified in the
Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS). The data ROSC reassessment found that national
accounts statistics are generally of a high quality, adequate to conduct effective surveillance and
adequately meet users’ needs. Since 2010, Mexico has made significant improvements on the
methodological and dissemination aspects of data quality. Nevertheless, areas for further
improvement and refinement exist, in particular, on the resources devoted to collecting state and
local government source data and seasonally-adjusted data, explaining data revisions, and on
compiling data on changes in inventories and on the volume of taxes on products.
INEGI has published annual sectoral accounts and balance sheets following the System of National
Accounts 2008 (2008 SNA) classifications of assets and sectors for the period 2003–2012 in
November 2013. These accounts were revised recently and published on June 30, 2014. STA
conducted a mission during 2014 to assess the possibility for developing quarterly sectoral accounts
and balance sheets and agreed with the Mexican authorities on a work plan for developing these
accounts. INEGI and Banxico agreed to collaborate in the compilation of quarterly stocks and flows
of financial assets and liabilities by institutional sectors.
The concepts and definitions for both the CPI and PPI meet international standards. The PPI is only
compiled by product and not by economic activity. A ROSC mission on prices was conducted in
November 2012.

Although some items of the balance of payments statistics conform to the Fifth edition of the
Balance of Payments Manual, a full transition has not yet been completed.1 Several measures to
improve external debt statistics have been carried out, including the compilation of data on external
liabilities of the private sector and publicly traded companies registered with the Mexican stock
exchange (external debt outstanding, annual amortization schedule for the next four years broken
down by maturity, and type of instrument). In 2014, STA conducted a technical assistance on
external sector statistics. The main purpose of the mission was to assist the balance of payment
statistics compilers in further strengthening their data collection and compilation system for external
sector statistics. In particular, the mission focused on foreign direct investment, financial derivatives,
bank accounts used in foreign exchange operations, capital account, and financial intermediation
services indirectly measured. The mission also assisted in addressing specific issues related to the
adoption of the methodology of the sixth edition of the Balance of Payments and International
Investment Position Manual (BPM6).
The authorities compile fiscal statistics following national concepts, definitions, and classifications
that make international comparison difficult. The statistics are comprehensive and timely, except for
states and municipalities. The new government accounting law mandates accounting standards that
follow international standards for all levels of government, and that take into account the
information needs of international organizations and national accounts. A full adoption of uniform
accounting standards at the sub-national level will be crucial to obtain a precise measure of public
fixed investment in national accounts, among others.
The authorities are committed to reporting government financial statistics in GFSM 2001 format, as
well as data for the GFS Yearbook.
The methodological foundations of monetary statistics are generally sound. However, the recording
of financial derivative and, to a lesser extent, repurchase agreements transactions are overstating the
aggregated other depository corporations (ODC) balance sheet and survey. Availability of data on
other financial intermediaries such as insurance companies and pension funds allow for the
construction of a financial corporation’s survey with full coverage of the Mexican financial system,
which is published on a monthly basis in International Financial Statistics.
Mexico is reporting Financial Soundness Indicators (FSIs) for Deposit Takers on a monthly basis.

Since the release of the balance of payments figures for the second quarter of 2010 (August, 25, 2010), Banco de
Mexico has been publishing a new format that follows the guidelines of the Fifth edition of the Balance of Payments
Manual.

PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Mexico’s gross public debt is projected to reach 47.8 percent of GDP by end-2014, remaining below
the 50 percent of GDP threshold that calls for higher scrutiny according to the new DSA criteria.1 Gross
financing needs are about 11 percent of GDP, declining to 8.3 percent at the end of the forecasting
period. The DSA suggests that Mexico’s government debt is sustainable even under severe shocks.
Given Mexico’s debt structure, the direct interest and exchange rate pass-through to the budget is
relatively low. Only the impact of sustained lower GDP growth rates represents a threat to debt
dynamics; yet, even under such scenario gross debt remains below 60 percent of GDP without
showing signs of an explosive trajectory. While public debt profile indicators are below upper early
warning benchmarks, main risks arise from the large share of debt held by non-residents—about
52 percent of total debt.

Baseline and Realism of Projections


Debt-levels. A higher primary deficit explains the increase in gross debt levels in 2014 relative to
2013; only partially compensated by a higher pace of growth and lower sovereign yields. As fiscal
consolidation plans kick in from 2016 onwards, gross debt levels are projected to decline from
the peak of 49.6 percent of GDP in 2016 to 48.2 of GDP by 2019. Staff projects that gross
financing needs will be 10.9 percent of GDP in 2014—down from 12.2 percent in the previous
year—and will decrease to 8.3 percent of GDP by 2019.



Growth. Past projections of growth outcomes suggest moderate forecast errors, with the only
exception of 2009 and 2010 as a result of the global financial crisis and the stronger-thanexpected recovery that followed. There is no apparent systematic bias in the growth outlook that
could undermine the DSA assessment. On the contrary, current growth projections at 2.4 percent
for 2014 remain below official estimates, which could imply a positive impact on debt dynamics if
growth turns out to be higher than expected.2 Nonetheless, Mexico’s debt dynamics are highly
sensitive to sudden changes in GDP growth, as indicated by the relevance of growth shocks
under the DSA stress tests.



Sovereign yields. Despite the volatility observed in most emerging markets last year, Mexico’s
sovereign yields remain low, with the 10-year local currency bond yield at around 572 basis
points as of August 29, only 130 basis points higher than the historical low. The spread between
this bond and US government bonds of the same maturity has remained on average at 328 basis
points for the last three months. In particular, spreads on foreign currency-denominated bonds
have narrowed and the local-currency sovereign yield curve has shifted down since January.
Given the upward projections for the US Libor rates over the medium-term, the effective nominal

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MEXICO

interest rate on Mexico’s sovereign debt is forecasted to rise from 6.1 percent in 2014 to
7.4 percent by 2019.


Fiscal adjustment. Under the baseline, the structural primary balance (adjusted by the cycle and
oil prices) improves between 2014 and 2019. The consolidation effort is driven by higher oil and
non-oil revenues that follow from the effects of the 2014 tax and energy reform. On the
spending side, the 2014 amendments to the fiscal responsibility law introduced a cap on the
growth of almost 50 percent of total spending (the so called “structural current spending”)
applicable from 2015 onwards. Considering the distribution of fiscal adjustment episodes
provided in the DSA template and pre-2009 Mexican evidence, the maximum projected 3-year
adjustment of the structural primary balance of 1.5 percent of GDP seems feasible.



Maturity and rollover. Given current debt structure (average maturity just under 8 years,
82 percent share of government securities at fixed interest, and only 24 percent of debt
denominated in foreign currency), the direct interest pass-through to the budget is very low. A
100 basis points shock to the yield curve across maturities is estimated to raise the interest bill by
just 0.1 percentage points of GDP. Similarly, a shock to the real exchange rate would only
marginally impact the debt stock, given the large share of debt denominated in local currency.
During the whole period, around 52 percent of marketable debt is held by non-residents, which
keeps rollover risks at a reasonable level.

Shocks and Stress Tests


Primary balance shock. A deterioration of 0.8pp of GDP in the primary balance in 2015–16
shifts up public debt by a similar amount, reaching 49.7 percent of GDP by the end of the
projection period. The gross financing needs also increase moderately. Yet, effective interest
rates on public debt do not deviate significantly from the baseline.



Growth shock. Real output growth rates are lowered by 1 standard deviation, or 2.9 percent, for
2 years starting in 2015. The decline in growth leads to a deterioration of nominal primary
balance compared to the baseline—as nominal revenues fall against unchanged expenditure
plans—reaching -2.4 percent of GDP by 2016. Accordingly, the debt-to-GDP ratio increases to
about 56 percent and then stabilizes around 54 percent at the end of the projection period.
Gross financing needs climb up to 12.3 percent of GDP in 2017 and then stabilize around
10 percent at the end of period.



Interest rate shock. Market concerns about medium-term debt sustainability intensify increasing
spreads by 200 bps starting in 2015. The government’s interest bill climbs reaching an implicit
average interest rate of almost 8.4 percent by 2019, about 1 percent higher than in the baseline.
Similarly, the debt-to-GDP ratio and gross financing needs increase, reaching 49.4 and
8.9 percent of GDP by 2019.



Combined shock. A combined shock incorporates the largest effect of individual shocks on all
relevant variables (real GDP growth, inflation, primary balance, exchange rate and interest rate).
In this case, debt would stabilize at around 59 percent of GDP without showing signals of an
explosive trajectory.

EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Mexico’s external-debt-to GDP ratio continues to be low and sustainable (35 percent
projected for end-2014), and is expected to remain stable over the medium-term. However,
stress tests suggest that some caution is warranted. Under an extreme shock scenario—a 30 percent
real exchange rate depreciation—the debt-to-GDP ratio would increase to 48 percent. Some
mitigating factors include the fact that a larger share of Mexico’s (public) debt is now denominated
in pesos, and Mexico has taken advantage of low interest rates. Moreover, the recognition of its
strong macroeconomic fundamentals by foreign investors has allowed it to lengthen the maturity
structure of its external debt in recent years. However, the large share of foreign holdings of the
peso-denominated government bonds exposes Mexico to sudden shifts in investor sentiment. Other
shocks, including to interest rates, current account and growth, have only a marginal impact on
Mexico’s external debt-to-GDP ratio.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
November 12, 2014

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with Mexico
On November, 7, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation1 with Mexico.
Mexico has completed the legislative process underpinning its comprehensive structural reforms
agenda. More than a dozen reforms have been approved over the last year and a half including on
energy, telecommunications, anti-trust, labor markets, education, and the financial sector. By
enhancing competition, reducing labor market frictions, and encouraging investment, the reforms
are expected to boost productivity and output over the medium term.
After a sharp slowdown in 2013—reflecting weak external demand and a decline in construction
activity—growth is projected to recover to 2.4 percent this year. The strong recovery in the U.S.
in the second quarter of 2014 has triggered a rebound in Mexico’s manufacturing production and
exports (especially in the automotive sector). In addition, construction activity is firming up,
supported by a rebound of residential investment and an increase of government spending on
infrastructure.
Labor market indicators suggest that the economy continues to operate below potential, helping
to contain inflationary pressures. The unemployment rate has inched up since early 2013, and
real wage growth has been subdued. Headline inflation rose to 4½ percent year-on-year in early
2014, reflecting one-off effects from tax changes. It is expected to stay around 4 percent in the
remainder of 2014, driven by increases in livestock and government-administered prices, before
declining gradually in 2015. Core inflation remains close to 3 percent and long-term inflation
expectations are well anchored.
The Bank of Mexico cut the policy rate by 50 basis points to 3 percent in June in the context of
limited inflationary pressures and a weak economy while fiscal policy remains broadly neutral.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2
The fiscal outturn for the first half of 2014 has been broadly in line with the Public Sector
Borrowing Requirement (PSBR) budget target of slightly over 4 percent of GDP.
Commercial bank credit growth slowed down in the first half of 2014 for households and firms.
Among corporate borrowers, the deceleration has been concentrated in construction: banks
reduced sharply lending to the sector after the financial difficulties of the three largest builders
surfaced last year. On the household side, consumer credit growth moderated to 8 percent (from
16 percent last year). In contrast, lending by the public-owned development banks is growing
rapidly, although from a low base, as the financial sector reform gave development banks a new
mandate of promoting micro-financing and lending to underserved sectors, including SME’s.
The share of non-performing loans (NPLs) in total loans by commercial banks has stabilized,
reaching 3¼ in June up from 2½ percent in 2012, reflecting mostly a rise in impaired loans in the
construction sector. However, NPLs have been fully provisioned, and profitability and
capitalization of the banking sector remains strong.
Mexico’s external position remains broadly consistent with fundamentals and desirable policy
settings. The current account deficit widened to 2.1 percent of GDP in 2013, reflecting higher net
factor payments, while the trade balance remained stable. In 2014, the current account deficit is
projected to remain unchanged with an improving trade balance offset by a continued increase in
factor payments. The nominal and real effective exchange rates have depreciated modestly since
end-2013. The current level of foreign reserves is adequate for normal times according to a range
of standard reserve coverage indicators. Gross portfolio inflows have rebounded after a sharp
slowdown in Q2 of 2013. In February, Moody’s raised Mexico’s foreign currency sovereign
rating to Aa3, citing the expected positive impact of structural reforms on potential growth.
Looking forward, the structural reforms in energy and telecommunications are expected to attract
significant foreign direct investment.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed the rebound in economic activity in Mexico, boosted by strong
external demand and a recovery in the construction sector. They also commended the completion
of the legislative process underpinning the country’s comprehensive structural reform agenda.
Directors noted that a potential surge in volatility in global financial markets poses risks. They
expressed confidence in Mexico’s strong policy fundamentals and noted that the FCL
arrangement has provided insurance against tail risks.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

Directors considered that the current stance of monetary policy remains appropriate. They
welcomed the Bank of Mexico’s commitment to adapting monetary policy in case of upward
pressure on prices. Directors took note of the staff assessment that the real exchange rate and the
current account balance are broadly consistent with underlying fundamentals. They observed that
a high level of international reserves in the context of Mexico’s free floating exchange rate
regime, as well as Mexico’s deep and liquid financial markets, should help the country weather
well a rise in volatility.
Directors supported the authorities’ plans to reduce the public sector borrowing requirement to
2.5 percent of GDP by 2018. They emphasized that strict adherence to the announced fiscal path
will strengthen the credibility of the new fiscal framework. Some Directors stressed that boosting
non oil revenues would be needed, especially if oil revenues are lower than anticipated. Directors
encouraged the authorities to improve budget implementation further through more realistic
expenditure budgeting and stricter control of budget execution. Directors welcomed the creation
of an oil stabilization and saving fund, and the plan to reform the pension system of the two large
state owned companies.
Directors observed that the monitoring and control of state and municipal finances need to be
strengthened. Full adoption of the uniform accounting methodology for reporting local
government finances and introduction of a formal legal framework to anchor fiscal policymaking
at the local level would be important.
Directors commended Mexico’s sound financial sector and the progress in strengthening the
regulation and consolidated supervision of large financial conglomerates. They advised careful
monitoring of the rise in non performing loans in housing and foreign currency borrowing among
some large companies. While welcoming the increased role of development banks in improving
financial inclusion, they recommended caution to avoid displacing private bank lending or
relaxing credit standards.
Directors underscored the importance of strong and steady implementation of the structural
reform agenda. Properly sequenced and executed, these reforms would boost productivity and
output growth over the medium term.
