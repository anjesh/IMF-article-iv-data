IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with Swaziland
On December 9, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with Swaziland.
Swaziland’s growth has been recovering since the 2010‒11 fiscal crisis, albeit at a slower pace
recently. Growth recovery following the fiscal crisis was broadly supported by the
manufacturing and service sectors. In 2015, however, growth is expected to slow, owing to
adverse weather conditions and a slowdown in tourism and transport sectors. Swaziland
continues to face significant development challenges, with high unemployment and poverty, and
prevalence of HIV. Inflation has stayed modest (4.5 percent in September 2015), reflecting low
international commodity prices.
Fiscal policy has become expansionary in recent years. Domestic revenue collection improved
with stepped-up administration efforts. Expenditures expanded even further since the crisis,
owing to increased recurrent spending (with fast growth in public sector wages) and a revival of
capital expenditures. Subsequently, after running surplus for two years, the fiscal balance turned
into a deficit in 2014/15. The deficit is expected to further increase in 2015/16 to 5 percent of
GDP due to lower Southern African Customs Union (SACU) revenues, wage adjustments, and
the supplementary budget. As a result, public debt is projected to grow fast in 2015, with heavy
reliance on short-term debt creating high rollover risks.
While international reserves have strengthened since the crisis, they have not reached an
adequate level. A current account surplus was recorded in 2014, supported by robust SACU
revenues and exports (e.g., wood pulp, textile); there were financial account outflows in light of
limited domestic investment opportunities. International reserves stayed at 3½ months of imports
in September 2015, below the authorities’ medium-term target of 5–7 months of imports.
Swaziland’s growth outlook is projected to remain subdued over the medium term, while it is
clouded with downside risks. Growth is expected to slow in 2016/17, followed by a modest

recovery in the following years. SACU revenues are expected to decline markedly in 2016/17,
putting pressures on fiscal and external balance. Furthermore, tighter or more volatile global
financial conditions and weaker growth in South Africa could have negative spillovers to
Swaziland. The recent weakening of the South African economy, together with the expected
revision to the revenue sharing formula, point to downside risks for SACU revenues.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed Swaziland’s recovery since the 2010‒11 fiscal crisis, but they
also stressed that significant challenges remain, including a prospective decline in the revenues
from the Southern African Custom Union (SACU), a weakening regional outlook, heavy
reliance on short-term financing, and large development needs reflected in high unemployment
and poverty and the continued prevalence of HIV. In light of the significant downside risks to
fiscal and external sustainability, Directors urged the authorities to substantially improve their
policy performance to promote macroeconomic and financial stability, rebuild the economy’s
resilience to shocks, and boost inclusive growth.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to shift toward a tighter fiscal stance. They
stressed that enhanced fiscal consolidation is needed over the medium term to ensure fiscal and
debt sustainability, while ensuring that spending for critical social and development is
safeguarded. Directors encouraged the authorities to contain recurrent expenditure, in particular
the wage bill, and strengthen public financial and investment management and domestic
revenue collection, while enhancing the international reserves buffer toward the medium-term
target of 5‒7 months of imports.
Directors called for further efforts to ensure financial sector stability, in light of growing
vulnerabilities and risks. They encouraged strengthening financial sector supervision and
regulation, with a particular emphasis on the nonbank financial institutions. Directors
commended efforts to enhance financial sector development and promote financial inclusion
and access to credit.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to tackle the substantial social and development
challenges, and encouraged stronger efforts to promote more inclusive growth through greater
private sector development. Directors urged the authorities to promote export diversification,
enhance access to financing, and improve the business climate, while the loss of trade
preferences from the United States and prospectively from the European Union underlines the
importance of enhancing broader economic diversification and competitiveness.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
November 24, 2015

KEY ISSUES
Context. Swaziland’s growth has been recovering since the 2010‒11 fiscal crisis, albeit at a
slower pace recently, and its significant development challenges continue, with high
unemployment and poverty. Over the past three years, Swaziland has shifted toward an
expansionary fiscal policy, while revenues from the Southern African Customs Union
(SACU) have declined in percentage of GDP since 2013/14. Hence, after running surpluses
for two years, fiscal balance turned into a deficit in 2014/15. International reserves stood at
3½ months of imports as of end-September 2015.
Emerging shock and risks. Swaziland’s economy faces new challenges. The recent
weakening of the regional economic outlook is likely to have adverse impacts on
Swaziland through trade and financial channels. The SACU revenues, in particular, are
projected to decline significantly in the coming years, raising concerns for fiscal and
external sustainability. These challenges, unless properly addressed, could weaken growth
and adversely affect financial sector stability.
Strengthening international reserve buffer. Maintaining sufficient international reserves
is important to ensure the confidence in the economy. To this end, fiscal consolidation is
needed over the medium term, while protecting spending for critical social and
development needs. Enhanced fiscal reforms―strengthening public financial (and
investment) management and domestic revenue collection―are critical policy agendas.
Safeguarding financial stability. Financial soundness indicators point to generally sound
banking system. A dominant size of the nonbank financial sector—which grew fast in
recent years—calls for strengthening of supervision and regulation for the sector.
Raising inclusive growth. To address social and economic challenges, it is essential to
raise Swaziland’s potential for inclusive growth, while the loss of the Africa Growth
Opportunity Act (AGOA) eligibility points the importance of enhancing economic
diversification and competitiveness. Stepped-up policy efforts in multiple areas are
needed: including improving business climate and export diversification.
Past advice. There is broad agreement with the authorities on macroeconomic policies
and structural reform priorities, but the implementation of past advice has been uneven.
Specifically, although the authorities acknowledge the need to pursue a prudent fiscal
policy stance and rein in current spending, there have been no major policy changes since
the last consultation. Progress on structural reforms (including improving business climate
and accelerating land reforms) has also been modest.

CONTEXT: GRADUAL RECOVERY FROM THE CRISIS
1.
Swaziland is a small middle-income country with close economic linkages to South
Africa. With Lesotho, Namibia, and South Africa, Swaziland is a member of the Common Monetary
Area (CMA). Under the CMA, the Swaziland lilangeni is pegged at par to the South African rand,
which is also legal tender in the country. CMA members and Botswana constitute the Southern
African Customs Union (SACU).
2.
Following parliamentary elections in 2013, the government has formulated a new
development strategy, committing to addressing Swaziland’s development challenges.1 Under
the strategy (“Program of Action” for the period through 2018), the government committed to
reducing poverty and inequality. To this end, while acknowledging difficult fiscal circumstances, the
government’s budget strategy for 2015/16 aims at sustaining economic growth, employment and
poverty reduction, while implementing measures to improve efficiency and lower the cost of doing
business.
3.
Swaziland’s growth has been recovering
since the 2010‒11 fiscal crisis, albeit at a slower
pace recently.2 Following the fiscal crisis, growth
recovered, supported by manufacturing (in particular
food and beverages industries), and construction and
wholesale and retail sectors (helped by increased
government spending). In 2015, however, growth is
expected to slow down, owing to adverse weather
conditions and slowdown in tourism and transport
sectors.3 While the nominal GDP increased by 20
percent as a result of the recent rebasing and
recompilation of GDP, Swaziland continues to face
significant development challenges, with high

Swaziland is an absolute monarchy, where the King holds the executive authority, which may be exercised either
directly or through the Cabinet or a Minister. Parliamentary elections are held every five years, following which the
King appoints cabinet members, 20 out of 30 senators, and 10 out of 65 members of the lower house.
2

The crisis originated in a sharp shortfall of SACU revenue in 2011/12 (by 9 percent of GDP) that deteriorated fiscal
and external balances through significant declines in fiscal revenue and current account transfers. It resulted in a
significant drawdown of international reserves and large domestic financing (including domestic payment arrears),
which weakened the confidence in the economy.
3

Changes in the South African visa and immigration rules introduced in June 2015—requiring travelers with children
to carry an unabridged birth certificate —appear to have affected the number of tourists coming to Swaziland since
mid-2015, as most of them go through South Africa. The South African government has recently relaxed some of the
requirements.

to meet some of the benchmarks set by the US
Government (since then, to regain the access, the Swaziland authorities have been making efforts to
address the benchmarks related to workers’ rights). This has led to a drastic decline in textile exports
to the U.S. market, leading to layoffs, though its impacts on overall growth and exports are modest,
given the relatively small size of the textile sector, and owing to increased exports to the South
African market (as the weakening of South African rand has made Swazi exports more competitive
compared with dollar-priced exports from other countries).4
5.
Fiscal policy became expansionary
after the 2010–11 fiscal crisis, supported by
the rebound of SACU revenues. Domestic
revenue collection continued to improve with
stronger performance by corporate and
individual income taxes and stepped-up
administration efforts (e.g., enhanced efficiency
in VAT collection, and strengthened
compliance).5 Expenditures expanded even
further since the crisis, owing to increased recurrent expenditure (mainly due to fast growth in public
sector wages) and a revival of capital expenditures.6 Subsequently, after running surplus for two
years, fiscal balance turned into a deficit in 2014/15. The deficit is expected to increase in 2015/16 to

Swaziland’s textile exports to the U.S. in 2014 are estimated to have reached US$55 million, equivalent to 3 percent
of the total exports and 1½ percent of GDP. Following the expiration of the AGOA, more than 2,000 workers (about
10 percent of the total textile employment) are reported to have been laid off.
5

In April 2015, the Swaziland Revenue Authority (SRA) introduced a new VAT refund scheme at border posts with
South Africa. It simplifies declaration process (for goods imported from South Africa) and contributes to mitigating
tax evasion. On domestic fronts, the compliance in domestic VAT improved in the sugar industry and the compliance
in import VAT also improved following enhanced post audit for imported goods.

An international convention center and a five star hotel are currently being constructed (at the estimated cost of

5 percent of GDP due to lower SACU revenues, wage adjustments (Text Figure 1), and increased
spending with the supplementary budget.7 As a result, public debt is projected to grow fast in 2015,
with heavy reliance on short-term debt creating high rollover risks.
6.
While international reserves have
strengthened since the crisis, they have not reached
an adequate level. A current account surplus was
recorded in 2014, supported by robust SACU revenues
and exports (e.g., wood pulp, textile), there were
financial account outflows in light of limited domestic
investment opportunities.8 International reserves stayed
at around 3½ months of imports, below the authorities’
medium-term target of 5–7 months of imports.

recently hit historical lows against the dollar. While
different estimation approaches give mixed results, the overall assessment―by properly accounting
for the cyclicality of SACU revenues on the current account―points to a moderate overvaluation (by
1–10 percent).9 The current account, however, might not necessarily improve with the exchange rate
depreciation if the expansionary fiscal policy continues.
8.
The implementation of advice from previous Article IV consultations has been uneven.
There was broad agreement with the authorities on macroeconomic policies and structural reform
priorities. However, despite the acknowledgement of the need to pursue a prudent fiscal policy
stance and rein in current spending, there have been no major policy changes since the last
consultation.

The supplementary budget is expected to amount to about E1.6 billion, including the cost of living adjustment for
wages (E370 million), an increase in budget appropriations for goods and services mainly related to foreign travels
(E265 million), grants for the University of Swaziland (E80 million), and capital projects (E700 million). Most of these
appropriations for goods and services and capital projects are made to meet spending needs on one-off basis.

Net FDI flow turned negative in 2014 as a South Africa-based wood pulp company sold its facility in Swaziland
following its closure in 2010 (owing to adverse market conditions and fire damage). Other outflows were associated
with portfolio and other investments in South Africa.

9.
Swaziland’s growth outlook is
projected to remain subdued over the
medium term, in view of a prospective
decline in SACU revenues, low private
sector activities, and the ongoing impacts
of the loss of Swaziland’s AGOA access.
Growth is projected to slow down in 2016/17,
followed by a modest recovery in the following
years. SACU revenues are expected to decline
markedly in 2016/17 (resulting from
adjustments for overpayments in 2014/15 and
expected slowdown in South Africa’s imports),
followed by a modest recovery over the
medium term. This SACU revenue shock would
put pressure on fiscal and external balances,
adversely affecting Swaziland’s economy
(described later). Increased fiscal imbalances
would necessitate large domestic financing
(owing to limited external financing sources)
and likely crowd out private sector credit,
which, together with the expected monetary
tightening (following the SARB), would
adversely affect the country’s growth.

1. Customs and excise revenue collections within the SACU region
are pooled and disbursed to each member state based on revenue
projections. An adjustment is made after two years, to correct for
discrepancies between the SACU revenues received (based on the
projections) and the level corresponding to the actual customs and
exercise revenue collection.

10.
Furthermore, risks mostly point to the downside. Tighter or more volatile global financial
conditions and weaker growth in South Africa could have negative spillovers to Swaziland
(specifically through trade and financial channels). The recent weakening of the South African
economy, together with the expected revision to the revenue sharing formula, point to downside
risks for SACU revenues, beyond what is captured in the baseline forecast. Furthermore, the rand’s
sharp depreciation may jeopardize price stability, though further declines in oil prices could lower
import costs. Structurally weak growth in key advanced and emerging economies and the removal
of the E.U. sugar quota in 2017 (which could lead to lower European sugar imports including from
Swaziland) may further weaken Swaziland’s growth outlook. In view of the policy challenges with the
expected decline in the SACU revenues, the government will play a critical role, where a strong
policy response could mitigate the impacts, posing an upside risk.
11.
The authorities fully acknowledged the risks and vulnerabilities. They were specifically
concerned of the prospects for SACU revenues and their impacts on fiscal and external
sustainability, in light of the experiences of the 2010–11 fiscal crisis. The authorities agreed with the
prospect for a suppressed level of SACU revenues for a prolonged period, while pointing to
downside risks to the current SACU revenue forecast over the medium term. In light of the risks

associated with the weakening of the rand, they also shared the concern on inflation, and pointed
out that the recent drought could also add to inflationary pressure.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Swaziland’s key challenges are therefore: (i) in the near term, to strengthen its resilience to shocks in
preparation for the expected SACU revenue fall and (ii) over the medium and long term, to achieve
higher and inclusive growth to meet its social and development needs. The 2015 Article IV consultation
focused on how Swaziland can address these challenges.

The experience of the 2010‒11 fiscal crisis
suggests the need to secure the minimum
international reserves of three months of imports.
Given Swaziland’s membership in the CMA, maintaining
sufficient international reserves is important to keep the
confidence in the arrangement. Looking back on the
experiences during the 2010‒2011 crisis, the risk
premium on Swaziland’s T-bill yield started to rise when
international reserves fell below three months of
imports. This level is viewed as an important benchmark
by the authorities, while the medium-term target is set
at 5‒7 months of imports. This target is deemed
adequate, in light of Swaziland’s high vulnerability to
shocks (Annex II).

13.
To address the forthcoming SACU revenue shock, the authorities intend to shift to a
tighter fiscal policy stance and keep international reserves above three months of imports.
Based on the experiences of the last fiscal crisis, the authorities target at keeping international
reserves above three months of imports, through stepped-up fiscal consolidation, without
compromising Swaziland’s growth potential and social needs. In terms of the medium-term reserve
target (5‒7 months of imports), they argue that it should be achieved over a longer term. Fiscal
deficits are targeted at 3‒6 percent of GDP, while allowing a larger deficit in 2016/17 when SACU
revenues would fall markedly. To achieve this, the authorities plan to implement the following
measures:

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KINGDOM OF SWAZILAND

(i)

contain recurrent expenditures, by enforcing procurement reforms, postponing
non-critical spending, and streamlining transfers to state-owned enterprise,10 while
safeguarding resources to health and education sectors as envisaged under the
“Program of Action” for the period between 2013 and 2018,

(ii)

reduce domestically-financed capital spending, by limiting the implementation of new
projects and reprioritizing ongoing projects and donor-funded projects,

(iii)

rationalize the wage bills by cleaning up unidentified workers11, removing allocations for
permanent vacant positions, and postponing the salary review (while allowing annual
cost of living adjustments),

(iv)

enhance domestic revenue collection, by improving taxpayer compliance rate (in income
tax and VAT) and tax collection rate, and enhancing self-assessments,12 and

(v)

Enhance the availability of financing, by (i) reaching out potential investors (in particular
nonbank financial institutions) for the auctions of government securities, (ii) issuing
long-term bonds in floating interest rate, and (iii) exploring to issue long-term bonds
linked to specific capital projects. To manage associated risks, a medium-term debt
management strategy, together with an annual borrowing plan, will be developed, while
improving cash management and forecasting, with technical assistance by the IMF.

The authorities have been working on procurement reforms. The Public Procurement Act was enacted in 2011,
while Swaziland Public Procurement Regulatory Agency commenced operations in late 2013. These reform efforts are
expected to effectively address significant overpricing of government procurement.
11

According to the ministry of public services, the recently finalized payroll audit discovered about 800 unidentified
workers (out of 41,000 public workers).
12

The SRA has been stepping up the tax collection efforts by strengthening physical visits and introducing personal
identification number to increase taxpayer’s registration rate, and by introducing tougher penalties to non-complying
taxpayers to improve tax filing compliance rate.

These efforts, envisaged under the baseline scenario, would help address the revenue
fall to some degree, though vulnerability would remain, with a thin margin of international
reserve buffer above the targeted floor (three months of imports). Fiscal deficits―following a
marked increase to 6 percent of GDP in 2016/17 (with the SACU revenue fall)―would stabilize
between 3¾‒4 percent of GDP over the medium term. This would help contain import demand and
keep international reserves slightly above three months of imports. With this level of international
reserves, however, Swaziland would remain vulnerable to any further exogenous shocks (possibly
stemming from downside risks mentioned above). Public debt―though staying below 30 percent of
GDP throughout the projected period―would increase steadily. Furthermore, the government’s
large domestic financing needs could crowd out private sector credit, adversely affecting private
sector developments and growth.

Policies to Strengthen Resilience
15.
To strengthen resilience to future shocks and crowding in private sector credit,
enhanced fiscal consolidation, through the policy steps below, is called for. Strengthening
resilience to shocks would be particularly important in light of the downside risks.




Contain expenditures, while mitigating
adverse growth impacts. Specifically it is
important to (i) reduce the impact of
the 2015/16 supplementary budget on
fiscal balances by reducing other
spending items under the original
budget, (ii) further contain public sector
wages, purchases of goods and
services, and subsidies and transfer, and
(iii) safeguard critical projects with high
investment returns and postpone less
critical capital projects.13

With enhanced fiscal consolidation (the reform scenario),
expenditures would return to the levels compatible to the
period of low SACU revenues.

essential infrastructure). The enactment
of the Public Financial Management Bill is critical to increase the transparency of the budgetary
process and to ensure that all expenditures are channeled through the appropriate budgetary
procedures, while capital projects should be thoroughly selected based on a well-defined
guideline. Key findings laid out in the Auditor General’s 2013/14 report should be thoroughly
followed up.14 Other key reform measures include preparing a coherent medium-term fiscal
framework and improving cash management and commitment control. Over the medium term,
it is also important to revisit the privatization policies and the rationalization of public
enterprises and realign spending following a comprehensive public expenditure review.

13

Wages could be further contained (beyond the authorities’ current plan), including through (i) limiting salary and
notch increases (to reduce per head cost), (ii) limiting new hiring, while reallocating resources to critical social areas,
and (iii) halting salary review (which could lead to sizable wage increases).

14

The report identified a number of potential irregularities in budget execution.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

KINGDOM OF SWAZILAND



Explore domestic revenue measures, through (i) prioritizing the collection of outstanding tax
arrears15, and (ii) exploring additional measures (such as ensuring dividend payments by profitmaking public enterprises, and increasing fuel tax and excise taxes in tobacco and alcohol to the
level comparable to that of South Africa). Given the low revenue performance (in terms of the
rebased GDP) relative to other countries in the region, a holistic review of domestic revenue
performance is needed (Text Figure 2). In this regard, the authorities are taking steps for a taxexpenditure analysis, a tax-gap analysis, and a review of tax incentives.16



Prepare for the implementation of a fiscal rule, with adequate PFM system. A well-designed fiscal
rule could help deal with the large volatility in SACU revenues and improve household welfare.
Staff analysis suggests that, once the SACU revenues stabilize, a fiscal rule which targets a nonSACU fiscal deficit and saves windfall SACU revenues (similar to the authorities’ plan) could help
ensure fiscal and external sustainability.17

15

As of August 2015, total outstanding tax arrears reached E2.1 billion, of which more than 30 percent is expected to
be recoverable.
16

SRA’s preliminary tax expenditure analysis suggests that the cost of tax exemptions are sizable, which is estimated
to be losses of E2.5 billion on corporate income tax and E0.36 billion on VAT.

A reform scenario incorporating these measures would strengthen the international
reserve buffer, while promoting growth over the medium term. With enhanced fiscal
consolidation, international reserves would stay above 3½ months of imports and reach to 4¼
months of imports by 2020. Fiscal account would be balanced by 2020/21, and government debt
would stay around 20 percent of GDP. The larger consolidation in recurrent expenditure, while
safeguarding budget allocation for critical capital and social spending, could help crowd in private
investment and private sector activities. Growth in the near term would be lower than in the baseline
scenario due to larger fiscal consolidation, but would improve over the medium term, supported by
structural reforms (described later) and crowding in private sector credit. Any upward revision to the
current SACU revenue forecast should be saved to build international reserves, while downward
revision may require enhanced consolidation efforts.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17.
The authorities recognized the need for enhanced policy efforts, while noting the
country’s development needs. They expressed the intention to step up efforts for improving the
quality of spending and enhancing domestic revenue collection, along the lines envisaged under the
reform scenario. They affirmed their intention to improve public financial management (including
through strengthening cash management and following up the auditor general’s recommendations).
In the meantime, the authorities committed to undertaking reprioritization exercise for both
recurrent and capital expenditure, while protecting critical social and development needs. Following
the finalization of the 2016/17 SACU revenue discussion (by end-2015), the authorities plan to
incorporate consolidation measures for the 2016/17 budget and the medium term fiscal framework.
Given that the supplementary budget has already been allocated, however, the authorities
expressed difficulty in fully offsetting it through reallocation.

B. Supporting Financial Sector Development and Managing Risks
18.
Swaziland’s banking system stays sound in general, but some vulnerabilities in the
financial sector are identified. All commercial banks meet the regulatory capital requirement.
Some banks, however, have relatively high nonperforming loans, while the banks have high credit
concentration on large borrowers (Box 1, Table 7). Other vulnerabilities include banks’ almost
unitary business model and the high level of concentration on both sides of banks’ balance sheets.
Nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs)—dominating the financial system in terms of asset size—are
directly or indirectly linked to the banking sector, including through NBFI’s deposits at banks, while
banks do not appear to lend directly to NBFIs.18

Box 1. Structure of Financial Sector 1
Performance indicators suggest that Swaziland’s banking system is functioning well, but with some
structural vulnerabilities.2 Capital ratios are well above regulatory minima (8 percent of risk-weighted
asset) and profitability is high (Table 7). NPLs of the banking system remain moderate on average (6.4
percent of total gross loans), though there is a wide variation among banks, with some banks having
substantially higher NPL ratios (20 percent). The system is also subject to several structural vulnerabilities,
including the almost unitary business model of three of the banks and the high level of concentration on
both sides of banks’ balance sheets.
Swaziland’s financial sector is exposed to several risks. The main risks are external in origin―a sharp
decline in the SACU revenues or a large drop in sugar price. These risks are confirmed by a quantitative impact
assessment, which shows that both the solvency and liquidity of banks could come under pressure if either or
both of the main risks were to materialize (Annex 2).
Furthermore, increasing links between banks and
NBFIs pose risks to financial stability. NBFIs deposits
in banks are the most apparent link between NBFIs and
banks. NBFIs (mostly pension and insurance companies)
place deposits with banks, partly to comply with the
local asset requirement and partly for liquidity
management purposes. Banks estimate that 10 percent
of their deposits are from NBFIs. Banks do not appear to
lend directly to NBFIs. Other indirect links are apparently
growing but harder to measure.

The authorities have made progress in enhancing financial sector stability. The Central
Bank of Swaziland (CBS) recently established a Financial Stability Unit (FSU) to strengthen its
capacity to undertake financial stability analysis and reporting. The FSU—while it is still not fully
staffed—has developed a concrete work program, covering the legal framework for financial stability
and institutional arrangements and reporting on financial stability. The CBS has introduced a riskbased supervisory framework for banks and begun the process of introducing the practice of riskedbased supervision, and it has also recently finalized a self-assessment against the Basel Core
Principles (BCPs). The Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA)—established in 2012—is almost
fully staffed, though it will take time to implement a robust examination process to supervise a large
number of NBFIs. Most of the Savings and Credit Cooperatives (SACCOs) have been licensed, and
on-site examinations for large SACCOs are being conducted, following the IMF TA
recommendations.

Box 2. Macro-Financial Linkages in Swaziland
The impact of SACU revenue fall on the economy could be augmented if the shock also threatens the
financial sector stability. Staff analysis confirms strong macrofinancial linkages in Swaziland, pointing to
adverse macroeconomic consequences of the SACU revenue fall and their impacts on financial sector.
The regression analysis shows that the SACU revenue shock would adversely affect the economy
(including through slower growth and higher sovereign risk premium) and worsen financial
sector stability.



A VAR-based analysis reveals that the SACU shock would adversely affects economic growth.
Growth is sensitive to a reduction in private credit (with a lag of one quarter), while a fall in

SACU revenues could significantly reduce the international reserves, leading to a hike in
sovereign spread and a reduction in private credit growth.


The estimates of the cross-country satellite model—based on a panel data of three SACU countries
(Lesotho, Swaziland, and Namibia)—suggest that the consequences of the SACU revenue fall
(slower growth, higher sovereign risk premium, and increased likelihood for government

arrears for suppliers) would adversely affect the payment capacity of borrowers from
commercial banks, and NPL ratios would rise. The analysis using bank-level data also confirms
that higher sovereign risk premium and stagnant real economy activities (as proxied by the
electricity consumption) would contribute to higher NPL ratios as observed in the past.
The potential impacts of the SACU revenue fall on financial sector could have further
feedback effects on growth. The VAR-based analysis suggests that, with an increase in NPLs, the
bank would deleverage lending in response to the deterioration in the asset quality, leading to lower
growth. The impulse response function in the figures below confirms this feedback channels (from the
bank’s asset quality to the real economy): an increase in NPLs temporarily reduces private credit and
growth (proxied by the electricity consumption growth in the absence of quarterly GDP data).

20.
Staff’s analysis suggests that the SACU revenue shock could threaten financial stability
(Box 2, Selected Issues Paper). The analysis reveals that the SACU revenue fall could worsen the
commercial banks’ asset quality and capital adequacy, mainly through three channels:
(i) triggering higher sovereign spread (and interest rate), (ii) crowding out private sector credit and
adversely affecting growth, and/or (iii) worsening the payment capacity of borrowers in
government-related sector (e.g., construction) and small and medium-sized enterprises, partly due
to the government’s arrears to suppliers and vendors, as observed during the 2010–11 fiscal crisis.
The negative impact on financial sector stability could be significantly augmented should the SACU
revenue fall also trigger payment difficulties of large borrowers.
21.
In light of these vulnerabilities, a set of supervisory and regulatory measures are called
for to enhance financial sector stability, while fiscal consolidation would also help to mitigate
the adverse consequences of the SACU revenue fall.


Strengthening Banking Supervision, through eradicating any shortcomings in risk-based
supervision and remedying gaps and inconsistencies in the legislative framework. Following
the completion of the self-assessment against the BCPs, it is important to make further
progress in addressing any shortcomings and facilitating the move to Basel II, with technical
assistance by the IMF.



Strengthening crisis preparation, through (i) establishing proper lender-of-last resort
functions, (ii) defining cooperation among the CBS, the Ministry of Finance, and FSRA in
crisis situation; and (iii) taking further step to manage possible adverse contagion from
South Africa through, for example, crisis management arrangements with the SARB in
addition to the information sharing MOU.



Softening the adverse impact of SACU revenue shock on financial sector stability, through
fiscal consolidation. It would help (i) build sufficient international reserve (which helps
containing risk premium), (ii) reduce government’s financing needs (allowing crowding in of
private sector credit), and (iii) ease the government’s liquidity situation (reducing the
likelihood of the government arrears).



Strengthening supervision for NBFIs and ensuring financial sector stability. The FSU should
be fully staffed. It is also essential to strengthen the supervision and regulation for NBFIs, fill
data gaps, and improve data sharing with the CBS.19 Systemically important financial
institutions should be identified and placed under close oversight.

22.
The authorities agreed with the staff’s view and shared the importance of further
strengthening financial sector supervision and regulation. As the financial sector strategy is
expected to be finalized soon (following technical assistance from the IMF and the World Bank), the

authorities intend to take further steps to enhance financial inclusion with proper regulatory
oversight. Coordination with the supervisory authorities in the region is being strengthened,
through attending supervisory colleges and enhancing information sharing with South African
authorities (including through the CMA governors’ quarterly meetings). The authorities are also
working on modernizing the legal framework, based on technical assistance by the IMF.

C. Structural Reforms to Enhance Inclusive Growth
23.
Swaziland’s significant development challenges―with high unemployment and
poverty, call for further increase in the country’s potential for inclusive growth, through
private sector developments. Swaziland’s weak growth performance—observed in the past
decades—appears to be associated with its inability to maintain private investment crucial for
sustainable economic development.20 Recent surveys show that investors view access to financing,
inefficient government bureaucracy and corruption as major constraints in doing business, which
may undermine investment and growth. Swaziland is ranked 105th out of 189 countries on the ease
of doing business in the World Bank’s 2016 Doing Business Indicators. 21 Despite some
improvements in recent years, Swaziland still ranks low on the ease of starting business, getting
electricity, and contract enforcement, owing to lengthy procedures. The land tenure system is also
seen as a constraint for investment.22

24.
Furthermore, the loss of AGOA eligibility raises the importance of enhancing economic
diversification and competitiveness, diversification and product quality have declined in
recent years. Swaziland’s export structure has experienced sizable changes over the past 15 years
(Selected Issues Paper). The share of textile exports has halved, and the expiration of Swaziland’s
AGOA qualification implies that the share of textile exports would decline further. This raises the
importance of enhancing economic diversification and competitiveness. Staff analysis suggests that,
though Swaziland’s export basket is relatively well diversified with reasonably good product quality
index compared with its peers, diversification and product quality have declined in recent years.
25.
The government sought to address structural weaknesses but with mixed progress.
The Economic Recovery Strategy and Private Sector Development Strategy point to the needs to
(i) improve regulatory and business environment (including procedural transparency and
administrative coordination), (ii) improve innovation, productivity and competitiveness; and
(iii) introduce a clear investment policy and transparent incentives. The Draft Land Policy (2009)
provides framework for dealing with land management issues and the Draft Land Bill (2013) aims to
address these issues. Implementation of these policies, however, has been slow owing to insufficient
supports by many key stakeholders.
26.
To address Swaziland’s development challenges, policy efforts from multiple
perspectives are called for, particularly in the following areas:


Promote export diversification and quality upgrading, through promoting private sector
development. Specifically, removing the perceived impediments for business (e.g., inefficient
government bureaucracy and corruption) and enhancing human capital are important for
export diversification and quality upgrading. Building on some progress in recent years, the
cost of doing business could be further reduced, including through making it easier to start
a business and enforcing contracts. Other export potentials (e.g., exploring Swaziland’s
mining resources, seeking possibilities to retain AGOA eligibility, diversifying export markets)
should also be explored.



Enhance access to financing, including through: (i) establishing a legal framework for
comprehensive credit information, (ii) establishing a legal framework for secured
transactions and a collateral registry, and (iii) enhancing mobile banking (using simple tools,

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

such as cell phone). These measures would be elaborated in the upcoming financial sector
strategy.


Other structural reforms. Improving education outcomes (in particular raising the low
secondary school enrollment) and training would help attract new (foreign) investment, and
facilitate innovation and inclusive growth. To improve land management, the authorities
should enhance efforts to finalize the Draft Land Policy and the Draft Land Bill.
Strengthening the anti-corruption and anti-money laundering regimes could also support
efforts to improve the business climate.

27.
The authorities generally agreed with staff’s suggestions. To ensure progress in
improving business climate, the government has stepped up its efforts, including through relaunching the Investor Roadmap in 2012 and creating an Investor Roadmap Unit in the Ministry of
Commerce, Industry, and Trade. On financial intermediation, the authorities affirmed their intention
to enhance financial sector developments and access to credit (particularly for small and medium
enterprises), based on the financial sector strategy. They also noted the progress in labor legislation
to satisfy the U.S. conditions, and hope that with additional progress it will allow the country to
regain the AGOA access. The authorities, however, expressed difficulty in undertaking land reforms
pending wider consultations, due to the complexity of the land management issues.

D. Other Surveillance Issues
28.
Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance with some data shortcomings in
fiscal sector. Staff welcomed the authorities’ recent efforts to rebase and update the national
account statistics, based on the new economic survey. On fiscal data, weak cash management is
associated with the lack of proper fiscal monitoring, which resulted in large unidentified financing
(1½ percent of GDP in 2012/13‒2014/15). To this end, it is critical to conduct reconciliation exercises
on a regular basis and strengthen cash management. On balance of payments statistics, sizable
errors and omissions (1.5 percent of GDP in 2014), reflecting the data and capacity constraints (e.g.,
compilation knowledge, source data, and the use of data) to comprehensively cover financial
transactions. IMF technical assistance is being planned for mid-2016.

STAFF APPRAISAL
29.
Though Swaziland continues to gradually recover from the 2010-11 fiscal crisis, its
resilience to shocks has not been sufficiently strengthened, exposing the country to future
shocks. Its growth performance has improved since the crisis, albeit with some slowdown in recent
years. International reserve buffer, however, has not reached the medium-term target, and the
government’s heavy reliance on short-term financing exposes it to high rollover risks. The
government’s recent shift to an expansionary fiscal policy stance also contributed to increasing
pressures on fiscal and external balances. In the meantime, it continues to face serious social
development challenges (with high inequality and unemployment).

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KINGDOM OF SWAZILAND

30.
The recent weakening of the regional economic outlook, likely followed by a decline in
SACU revenues, poses significant challenges for Swaziland. A slowdown in the South African
economy is likely to have adverse impacts on Swaziland through multiple channels. The expected
decline in SACU revenues in the coming years, in particular, is raising serious concerns for fiscal and
external sustainability. Based on the experiences of the last fiscal crisis, it is important to maintain
international reserves above three months of imports, while keeping the medium-term target of 5‒7
months of imports.
31.
Swaziland stands at a critical juncture to address significant economic challenges.
Specifically, its key challenges are: (i) in the near term, to address the expected SACU revenue fall
and manage its impacts on fiscal and external balances and (ii) over the medium and long term, to
achieve higher and inclusive growth to meet its social and development needs.
32.
In view of the near-term challenge (maintaining international reserves above three
months of imports), staff welcomes the authorities’ intention to pursue fiscal consolidation in
coming years. Though fiscal consolidation efforts may temporarily have adverse impacts on growth,
sufficiently strong policy response would strengthen international reserves and help maintain the
confidence in the economy. While staff welcomes the authorities’ intention to shift toward a tight
fiscal policy stance, enhanced consolidation measures would be advisable with safeguarding critical
spending for social and development needs. Specifically, it is important to rationalize both recurrent
and capital expenditures, enhance domestic revenue collection, and effectively implement PFM and
PIM reforms. Enhanced fiscal consolidation—as envisaged under the reform scenario—could help
crowd in private sector credit and facilitate private sector developments.
33.
Staff calls for further efforts to ensure financial sector stability, in light of
vulnerabilities and risks. Specifically, the SACU revenue fall could threaten financial sector stability,
which reiterates the needs for fiscal consolidation to mitigate the adverse impacts of the fall. Further
progress in risk-based supervision for banks is essential in light of the high credit concentration on
large borrowers and external vulnerabilities. In light of the dominant size of NBFIs, strengthened
supervision and regulation for NBFIs are also called for.
34.
To address social and development needs, it is essential to raise the country’s potential
for inclusive growth, through private sector developments. While the recent loss of AGOA
eligibility adversely affected export and employment, Swaziland’s textile producers have explored
alternative export markets in the region (South Africa in particular). Building on this progress, fasttracking policy efforts in multiple areas are needed: to promote export diversification, enhance
access to financing, and improve the business climate. Staff commends the progress in preparing a
financial sector strategy, based on technical assistances by the IMF and the World Bank, and calls for
the implementation of reform measures as envisaged under the strategy. Maintaining the soundness
of the financial sector is also critical for private sector-led growth.

35.
While Swaziland continues to maintain one exchange restriction related to advanced
payments for certain imports (subject to Fund approval under Article VIII), the authorities
have not requested and staff does not recommend the approval of this restriction.
36.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation with Swaziland take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

Nature/source of main risks

Likelihood of realization in the
next three years

Expected impact on economy
if risk is realized

Possible Policy
Response

Tighter or more volatile global financial conditions:
 Sharp asset price adjustment and decompression of credit
spreads as investors respond to unanticipated changes in
growth prospects, Fed policy rate path, and increases in U.S.
term premia, with poor market liquidity amplifying the effect
on volatility.
 Persistent dollar strength. Improving U.S. economic
prospects versus the rest of the world leads to a further dollar
surge, boosting non-U.S. trade but creating balance sheet
strains for dollar debtors.

HIGH

MEDIUM/SMALL

May need to tighten
fiscal policy if financing
becomes problematic.

Structurally weak growth in key advanced and emerging

HIGH (Euro area and Japan)

MEDIUM

MEDIUM (Emerging markets)

Current account would
deteriorate with weaker exports.
Economic growth would also be
affected.

economies (the “new mediocre”):
 Euro area and Japan. Weak demand and persistently low
inflation from a failure to fully address crisis legacies and
undertake structural reforms, leading to low medium-term
growth and accumulation of financial imbalances.
 Emerging markets, including China. Maturing of the cycle,
misallocation of investment and excess corporate leverage
(including in FX) fueled by a prolonged period of easy global
financial conditions, and insufficient progress with reforms
leads to a significant medium-term growth slowdown.
A larger-than-forecasted decline in SACU revenues in
2016/17 and beyond and/or delayed policy adjustment to a
prospective decline in SACU revenue fall

Capital flow reversals in
South Africa could weaken rand
and push up sovereign
borrowing cost, which would
push up borrowing cost in
Swaziland as well.
Weakness of rand could add
to inflationary pressures.

Slower growth in Europe would
adversely affect sugar exports
(one of Swaziland’s key export
items) to Europe.
Slower growth in South Africa
would reduce Swaziland’s exports
to South Africa.

MEDIUM (2016/17)

1

MEDIUM/LARGE

HIGH (2017/18 and beyond)
South African economy, together
with the expected revision to the
revenue sharing formula, point to
downside risks for SACU revenues,
beyond what is captured in the
baseline forecast.

Risks to energy prices:
 Increased volatility due to uncertainty about the persistence
of the oil supply shock and the underlying drivers of the price
decline.

Expedite
structural reforms to
improve business
environment and
promote private
sector development.

MEDIUM

revenue would worsen the fiscal
and external balance, threaten
financial stability, and adversely
affect growth.

Higher fuel prices would add
to pressures on prices and
external balances.

Enhance fiscal
consolidation by
containing spending and
enhancing revenue
mobilization.

May need to
tighten fiscal policy if
the pressures
become problematic.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks
listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and
30 percent, and “high” a probability of 30 percent or more). The RAM reflects staff views at the end of the Article IV consultation mission.

Annex I. Exchange Rate Assessment 1
Staff analysis suggests that Swaziland’s real effective exchange rate (REER) is moderately overvalued compared
to the level that would be consistent with fundamentals. The estimated results are mixed using different
approaches, but overall points to moderate overvaluation.

Buyoed by increased SACU revenues
after the 2010-11 fiscal crisis, Swaziland’s current
account has improved since 2010. The recent
improvement of the current account can be mostly
attributed to a rebound in SACU revenues (after 201011) and improved sugar exports (2013-14). In 2015,
however, the closure of the Ngwenya iron ore mine
and the expiration of access to the African Growth and
Opportunity Act (AGOA) are expected to weigh on
export earnings, leading to a slight decline in the
current account surplus.

2.
Swaziland’s REER has depreciated since its peak at end-2010 and recently moved close to
its historical average. Since the lilangeni is pegged to the South African rand, the depreciation has mostly
followed the rand, although the pace of the recent depreciation was less pronounced for Swaziland. On
average, the REER has depreciated by about 12 percent between end-2010 and end-2014, reversing the bulk
of the appreciation of 2009-10, and currently stands at 2.7 percent below its historical average over
1995‒2015.
3.
Staff assessed the 2014 REER based on the IMF’s EBA-lite methodology. The EBA-lite
methodology extends the EBA approach to a much broader
REER
(2010=100)
group of countries (147 including EBA countries). The EBA130

lite methodology comprises three methods, each based on

however bring important differences relative to CGER in the

that EBA-lite takes into account a much broader set of
factors—including policies, cyclical conditions, and global
capital market conditions—that may influence the current account and real exchange rate.

4.
Based on the original IMF’s CA EBA-lite model, Swaziland’s REER is estimated to be
moderately undervalued (12.8 percent), though this result requires caution. The results of the current
account approach should be cautiously interpreted because the CA-gap is mostly explained by the
regression residuals, while Swaziland has a unique current account structure with significant SACU revenues.
Since the actual current account in 2014 is a surplus of 2.9 percent of GDP and the CA-norm is -1.5 percent,
the CA-gap is estimated to be 4.4 percent of GDP, of which -1.7 percent is due to policy gaps. The estimated
elasticity of the trade balance to changes in the REER is -0.30. Thus, the REER would need to appreciate by
15.2 percent to close the gap between the CA and the CA-norm.
5.
Taking into account the characteristics of the SACU revenues, the assessment now points
to a slight overvaluation (3.5 percent). Though the SACU revenues (about 16 percent of GDP on average
over the last ten years) ―which tend to be highly volatile depending on South African economy and the
needs for adjustments for previous SACU disbursements―are crucial determinants of Swaziland’s current
account, they are not captured by the fundamentals covered in the EBA-lite model. Thus, an ad-hoc
adjustment is made to better account for these revenues. Staff estimates the impact of these revenues on
the cyclically adjusted CA-norm to be 5.6 percent of GDP2, and therefore, the cyclically adjusted CA-Norm is
now estimated at 4.1 percent of GDP (-1.5 plus 5.6). With this adjustment, the new CA-gap is -1 percent of
GDP, suggesting a slight overvaluation of 3.5 percent. The contribution of policy gaps to the CA
misalignment is estimated at -1.7 percent of GDP and is mostly due to a deviation of fiscal policy from its
desirable position. Indeed, the cyclically adjusted fiscal balance in 2014 (-3.6 percent) is judged to be below a
level that would be recommended for the future (2 percent)3 and thus, eliminating this gap would have help
to reduce CA and REER misalignments.

The SACU revenues―categorized as part of current transfer in the balance of payment statistics―are different from other
current transfers as the revenues are recognized as customs and excise revenues collected and distributed by the SACU
member states (Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa, and Swaziland). Nevertheless, the revenues have the economic
characteristic similar to those of aid: (i) the revenues are paid in non-local currency (South African rand); (ii) they are disbursed
to the government account and used to finance fiscal spending; and (iii) they tend to be volatile and are not under the
government’s control. Thus, for the purpose of this exercise, aid is adjusted to reflect SACU revenues.

6.
Similarly, the IMF’s index REER EBA-lite model―while pointing some undervaluation of
the REER (14 percent) in its original version―indicates a REER broadly in line with fundamentals (an
overvaluation of 1 percent) on a SACU revenue-adjusted basis. Based on this assessment, the actual
REER is 4.49 in 2014, compared with its norm of 4.63 (all expressed in logs). Given that the model does not
also capture the impact of SACU revenues, the REER-norm is adjusted down to 4.48.4 With this result, the
adjusted model implies that Swaziland’s REER is broadly in line with fundamentals (an overvaluation of 1%).

7.
The EBA-lite External Sustainability (ES) approach points to a moderate overvaluation of
the REER in the scenario stabilizing the net IIP at its 2014 level (15.8 percent of GDP). In this scenario,
the underlying CA and the CA-norm are -3.3 and -0.3, respectively. Therefore, the CA-gap is -3 percent of
GDP and the REER should depreciate by 10.1 percent to close this gap since the Swaziland’s specific elasticity
of the current account to the REER is -0.30.
8.
In summary, staff analysis points to a moderate overvaluation (by 1-10 percent) at end2014. This is to put in perspective with a further depreciation of 2.8 percent since end-2014.

Annex II. Adequate International Reserves 1
Revised and updated analysis confirms a desirable level of reserve coverage of 5─7 months of imports, as
discussed with the authorities during the 2014 Article IV consultation.
1.
After a strong rebound from the 2010─11 crisis, Swaziland’s reserve coverage has marginally
declined over the past year. Gross official reserves currently stand at 3½ months of projected 2016 imports
of goods and services.

2.
Swaziland’s international reserves are adequate
based on traditional simple adequacy metrics. Reserves are
well above traditional metrics based on import coverage,
short-term debt by residual maturity,2 and broad money (used
to capital flight risks, given that many recent capital account
crises have been accompanied by outflows of residents’
deposits). These metrics are simple and intuitive, but narrowly
focus on a specific aspect and could lead to an underestimate
of vulnerability.

3.
Reserve adequacy is also assessed using the composite IMF metric. The IMF metric (IMF 2015,
2013, 2011) is designed to measure the vulnerabilities that might arise in a country’s balance of payments
during an exchange market pressure event. It captures vulnerabilities from four possible sources: (i) lower
exports (X); (ii) lower rollover rates of short term debt (at remaining maturity) (STD); (iii) non-resident capital
outflows proxied by longer-term debt and equity liabilities (OL), where OL is defined as the sum of portfolio
liabilities and other investment liabilities minus short-term debt (at remaining maturity); 3 and (iv) resident
capital flight proxied by broad money (M2). Specifically, the metric for countries with fixed exchange rate
regime is computed as:
Reserve Adequacy
(billions of emalangeni)

30% of STD+ 20% of OPL + 10% of M2 + 10% of X.
The relative risk weights for each component are
based on the 10th percentile of observed outflows
from emerging market countries during exchange
market pressure episodes. The metric is found to
better predict exchange market pressure and other
crisis events than traditional simple metrics (IMF
2015). This metric is designed for countries with
market access. Although Swaziland’s sovereign

securities are all domestically owned,4 this metric still provides a useful benchmark.
4.
Reserve coverage is barely sufficient using the IMF metric. Reserves in the range of 100–150
percent of the metric are considered broadly adequate for precautionary purposes. Swaziland’s reserve
currently stands at 145 percent of the IMF metric. Reserve coverage at 150 percent of the metric would be
equivalent to 3.7 months of imports or 16 percent of (2015) GDP. IMF (2015) also makes the argument that
in countries with capital flow management measures (capital controls), there are fewer outflows during
exchange market pressure events. For these countries a smaller weight of 5 percent could be applied to
broad money, to reflect the lower risk of resident flight. Swaziland has a capital flow management measure
in place which requires non-bank financial institutions to invest 30 percent of their assets domestically. If the
adjustment for capital control is made, current reserve coverage would rise to 161 percent of the metric.
5.
However, the standard IMF metric does not take into account risks associated with the volatile
SACU revenue receipts. As shown during 2010–11, a large decline in SACU revenues quickly drained
Swaziland’s international reserves, from 4.0 months of imports at end-2009 to 2.3 months of imports at end2011, with the country falling into a fiscal crisis. With another major SACU revenue shock looming next year,
it is important to take into account of the SACU revenue shock into reserve adequacy analysis.
6.
A modified IMF metric incorporating the risk of SACU revenue shock calls higher reserve
coverage. Accumulated decline of SACU revenue during 2010‒11 amounted to 94 percent of the level of
pre-crisis SACU revenue. Applying the same concept in the construction of the standard IMF metric leads to
the following revised metric for Swaziland:
30% of STD+ 20% of OPL + 10% of M2 + 10% of X + 80% of SACU revenue,
where a more conservative 80 percent weight5 is used for the SACU revenue shock. Maintaining a
100 percent coverage of the metrics would require international reserve coverage of 5.1 months of imports,
or 22 percent of GDP.
7.
Swaziland’s reserve adequacy is further examined using a cost-benefit analysis approach. The
analysis is based on Dabla-Norris et al. (2011, also see IMF 2013, 2015), which is intended for low-income
countries and quantifies the optimal level of reserves to prevent and mitigate shocks. Countries choose
reserve level R to maximize the net benefit of holding reserves (NBR):

Large shock events are identified if the annual percentage change of the following variables falls below the 10th percentile in


P represents the conditional probability of a crisis given a large shock event, where crisis is defined as
a sharp drop in absorption. P depends on reserve level R and other variables (W) including fiscal balance and
policy and institutional framework (using the World Bank’s CPIA index), where higher values are associated
with less crisis. Estimated fiscal balance for 2014/15 is used. The CPIA index is not available for Swaziland,
and the value for Lesotho is used as a proxy.

C represents the utility cost of a crisis. It depends on reserve level R and other variables (Z) including
external demand,7 terms of trade, FDI, and aid to GDP ratio. For these variables, the 10th percentile value over
the past 20 years is used.


Finally, r represents the opportunity cost of holding reserves.

8.
The analysis points to higher optimal reserve level for Swaziland than the other methods. The
optimal level of reserves critically depends on the opportunity cost of holding reserves which is however

(weighed average of 3-year and 3-month
securities) and the average real interests on 3-month U.S. T-bill and 2-year U.S. treasury bond. This implies a
cost of holding reserves at 2.0 percent (after correcting for average annual real exchange rate depreciation
over the past 10 years), which corresponds to an optimal level of reserves equivalent to 7.0 months of
imports. The desirable reserve level would be even higher if medium term fiscal balance (a higher deficit) is
used (instead of the 2014/15 value as we did).
9.
In summary, Swaziland needs to further increase its reserve coverage from the current level to
prepare for exogenous shocks. While there are uncertainties to the exact optimal level of reserves, the
analyses using various methodologies suggest that Swaziland should aim to increase its international reserve
to 5-7 months of imports.

Annex III. Debt Sustainability Analysis 1
Though Swaziland’s current public debt level is low, large gross financing needs raise concerns. The debt
sustainability analysis (DSA) indicates that, under the baseline scenario, most of the public debt indicators
remain below their relevant indicative thresholds over the medium term, although high gross financing needs
raises concerns for a continuous accumulation of public debt and rollover risks. Should the SACU revenue fall
significantly (as experienced in 2010–11), the debt level could rise sharply, leaving little scope for absorbing
shocks.
Recent developments
1.
Swaziland’s public debt remains low, although it has risen since the last fiscal crisis. The debt
increased in nominal terms from 11 percent of GDP in 2009 to nearly 14 percent of GDP in 2014, owing to a
large increase in primary deficit (during the fiscal crisis in 2010–2011). Meanwhile, gross financing needs
remain high, at about 11 percent of GDP. Improved SACU revenue after the fiscal crisis relieved pressure on
the fiscal front, leading to a fiscal surplus recorded for 2012 and 2013, though it turned deficit in 2014.
2.
The central government has steadily increased their reliance on domestic debt for its
borrowing needs. In terms of the composition of public debt, the proportion of debt denominated in
domestic currency increased over time, reducing exposure to exchange rate risk. The share of domestic debt
rose from 12 percent of total public debt in 2009 to about 50 percent in 2014. By the end of 2014, treasury
bills account for around 61 percent of the government’s domestic debt.
3.
The country’s external public debt—primarily in the form of project loans from bilateral and
multilateral sources as well as private creditors—is relatively high (53 percent of the total debt), albeit
on a declining trend. While its importance—relative to domestic public debt—has declined, the
composition of external public debt has been quite stable over the past few years.
Medium term public DSA
4.
A heat map suggests that, while the public debt level is not subject to imminent risks, the
country faces risks relating to its gross financing needs and debt profile (Figure 1). Under the baseline
scenario, the gross financing needs would increase continuously and exceed 15 percent of GDP benchmark
level by 2016. All standard macro-fiscal shocks would push the gross financing needs even higher. In
particular, the primary balance shock would significantly raise the gross financing needs compared with the
baseline. The large share of debt held by non-residents—albeit on a downward trend—also highlights
vulnerabilities in the debt profile.
Baseline scenario
5.
The baseline macroeconomic scenario for the DSA is based on the status-quo policies,
consistent with the macroeconomic framework underlying the 2015 Article IV Staff Report.
Specifically, growth is expected to decline below 1 percent per annum in 2016 and remain sluggish (slightly

1

41

KINGDOM OF SWAZILAND

above 1 percent per annum). With a prospective decline in the SACU revenue, the total revenues (including
grants) would decline to about 24.1 percent of GDP in 2016 which would gradually recover to around 25
percent of GDP by 2019. Primary fiscal expenditure would slightly decline but is assumed to remain
expansionary as envisaged under the baseline scenario. Interest payment would increase over time due to
an accumulation of public debt and higher interest rate. As a result, primary fiscal balance would remain
negative and be around 4 percent of GDP in 2016 which is expected to be mainly financed by short-term
borrowing and the withdrawal of government deposits. The realism of this scenario is assessed in Figure 2.
The forecast errors for Swaziland on real GDP growth and inflation have been mostly in line with other
countries, while the forecast track record shows relatively larger forecast errors for the primary balance which
largely reflects the high uncertainty associated with prospective SACU revenues. 2
6.
The DSA under the baseline scenario indicates that the level of public debt would continue to
rise over the medium term, although it remains below the indicative threshold of 60 percent. Under
the baseline scenario, the expected increase in fiscal deficits and an increase in interest payment would lead
to fast accumulation of public debt (Figure 3). Gross public debt would approach 30 percent of GDP by 2020.
As it is expected to be financed mainly domestically by short- and medium-term treasury bills/bond (Figure
4), gross financing needs are projected to grow continuously, from about 11 percent of GDP in 2014 to
about 20 percent of GDP in 2020.
7.
The results under the alternative scenarios highlight the importance of fiscal consolidation to
avoid a continuous increase in public debt and gross financing needs
(Figure 4). Gross public debt and public gross financing needs would be brought down to lower level when
(i) the primary deficit is set to be constant from 2015 onwards (“Constant Primary Balance” scenario) and (ii)
when real GDP, the primary deficit, and real interest rates are set at their historical average (“Historical”
scenario).
8.
The customized stress test, which simulates a SACU revenue shock, results in an accumulation
of public debt-to-GDP ratio (which approaches the threshold level) and a sharper increase in gross
financing needs. The results of the standardized macro-fiscal stress tests (especially the primary balance
shock) similarly demonstrate an increase in gross public debt and public gross financing needs. The
customized stress tests on a further fall in the SACU revenue (by 5 percent of GDP in 2016-17) and on
contingent liability shock are also conducted. Under the SACU revenue shock scenario, gross public debt
would be estimated to rise up to about 40 percent of GDP, and the gross financing needs would approach
30 percent of GDP by 2020. The rapid increase in gross financing needs would potentially crowd out the
private sector credit, as well as posing risks related to the maturity structure and debt roll-over.
9.
The tighter fiscal policy scenario (reform scenario) would help to avoid a constant increase in
public debt and help to revert the gross financing needs to sustainable level (Figure 5). To strengthen
the country’s resilience to exogenous shocks, the reform scenario assumes enhanced fiscal consolidation. As
a result, the primary balance is assumed to turn positive by 2018, leading to the reduction in gross financing
needs (to around 10 percent of GDP by 2020) and public debt stock would be stabilized around 14 percent
2

The medium-term projection of the SACU revenue is revised to reflect latest budget projection by South African treasury on
the total SACU transfer to the revenue pool. The SACU revenue for Swaziland is computed based on the Swaziland’s latest
share of SACU revenue from the total pool.

42

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KINGDOM OF SWAZILAND

of GDP. A similar result would be achieved under the historical scenario where the real GDP growth, the
primary balance, and the real interest rate are set at their historical averages. Under such scenarios, public
debt and gross financing needs are projected to be sustainable over the medium term.
Medium Term External DSA
10.
Swaziland’s gross external debt has remained low and recently declined slightly from nearly
16 percent of GDP in 2010 to 11.5 percent of GDP in 2014. Under the baseline assumptions, gross
external debt is projected to only slightly increase to 12.3 percent of GDP in 2020.
11.
Stress tests, while pointing no imminent concerns for external debt trajectory, indicates
vulnerability to shocks to the non-interest current account and large exchange rate depreciations.
Standardized sensitivity analysis suggests that Swaziland’s external debt is resilient to interest rate and
growth shocks, but a 30 percent real depreciation would raise the external debt-to-GDP ratio to around
17 percent in 2020. A large current account deficit—with 2.8 percentage points of GDP (one-half standard
deviations) larger than projected in the baseline—would likely put the country on an unsustainable path, as
the external debt-to-GDP ratio would increase to 27 percent by 2020. Thus, moderating the non-interest part
of the external current account balance is important for external debt sustainability.
Conclusion
12.
Overall, the DSA indicates that, though the debt level is not posed to imminent risks, high
gross financing needs and projected pace of debt accumulation raise concerns. Both public debt and
external debt are on sustainable trajectories below the debt stock thresholds under the baseline scenario.
Furthermore, should the expected pace of debt accumulation continue over the longer period, Swaziland
would eventually face higher debt distress. In addition, the analysis found that the public debt outlook is
particularly vulnerable to a shock of SACU revenue. Finally, increasing gross financing needs projections—
with excessive reliance on short-term financing—raise concerns for risks associated with distorted maturity
structure and debt roll-over.
13.
Given the difficulty to secure stable external financing sources, shifting toward more prudent
fiscal policy, along the lines envisaged under the reform scenario, is critical for macroeconomic
stability and debt sustainability over the medium term. As presented in the analysis under the reform
scenario, it is important to tighten the fiscal policy stance over the medium term with a view to maintaining
fiscal and debt sustainability over a longer term.

2/ The cell is highlighted in green if gross financing needs benchmark of 15% is not exceeded under the specific shock or baseline, yellow if exceeded under specific shock
but not baseline, red if benchmark is exceeded under baseline, white if stress test is not relevant.
3/ The cell is highlighted in green if country value is less than the lower risk-assessment benchmark, red if country value exceeds the upper risk-assessment benchmark,
yellow if country value is between the lower and upper risk-assessment benchmarks. If data are unavailable or indicator is not relevant, cell is white.
Lower and upper risk-assessment benchmarks are:
200 and 600 basis points for bond spreads; 5 and 15 percent of GDP for external financing requirement; 0.5 and 1 percent for change in the share of short-term debt; 15
and 45 percent for the public debt held by non-residents; and 20 and 60 percent for the share of foreign-currency denominated debt.
4/ Long-term bond spread over U.S. bonds, an average over the last 3 months, 24-Mar-15 through 22-Jun-15.
5/ External financing requirement is defined as the sum of current account deficit, amortization of medium and long-term total external debt, and short-term total external
debt at the end of previous period.

1/ Public sector is defined as central government. All figures are in calendar year basis.
2/ Based on available data.
3/ Long-term bond spread over U.S. bonds.
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year.
5/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as ae(1+r).
8/ Includes asset changes and interest revenues (if any). For projections, includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

the boxes represent average projections for the respective variables in the baseline and scenario being presented.
Ten-year historical average for the variable is also shown.
2/ For historical scenarios, the historical averages are calculated over the ten-year period, and the information is used
to project debt dynamics five years ahead.
3/ Permanent 1/4 standard deviation shocks applied to real interest rate, growth rate, and current account balance.
4/ One-time real depreciation of 30 percent occurs in 2015.

The lilangeni (plural: emalangeni) is pegged at parity to the South African rand, which is also legal
tender. Exchange rates for the U.S. dollar are based on the floating middle rate of the South African
rand against the U.S. dollar. The average rate in September 2015 was E1 = US$0.073. Swaziland
maintains an exchange restriction subject to Fund approval under Article VIII arising from a 50
percent limit on the provision for advance payments for the import of capital goods in excess of 10
million emalangeri.

Article IV Consultation
The last Article IV Consultation was concluded on July 15, 2014. Swaziland is on the standard 12

STATISTICAL ISSUES
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Swaziland is assessed as “Category B” with regards to data adequacy for surveillance
Purposes (data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance). Staff’s
analysis is mainly affected by shortcomings in the national accounts and fiscal sector.
Real sector statistics: Swaziland’s GDP is broadly adequate for surveillance. The Central Statistical Office
(CSO) has been working to compile a new benchmark for 2011 based on contemporary data from
household and business surveys. This data has been used for the 2015 Article IV consultation and is
expected to be published by the end of 2015. Shortcomings remain with regards to the treatment of
Southern African Customs Union (SACU) revenue. Although the SACU group meeting at end-2012
resulted in a common understanding among technicians from the statistical offices, the treatment of
SACU revenue in national accounts has yet to be agreed by member commissions.
CSO publishes labor market statistics with long delays. The most recent unemployment data is for 2010
and the 2013 numbers are only expected to be released by end–2015. For 2016, the authorities are
planning to conduct the third labor force survey (the first was conducted in 2007).
The consumer price index was significantly revised in May 2007 in the context of the GDDS initiative,
incorporating improvements in compilation methodology, market basket coverage, flexibility for
introducing new pricing outlets and new varieties of products, and enhanced processing capabilities.
Four new geographical indices, as well as a national index, with updated market basket weights, are now
available. Monthly consumer price data are published by CSO with a one-month lag.
Monetary and financial statistics: Although some progress was achieved in the reporting of data on the
other depository corporations (ODCs), quality problems remained, particularly in the areas of coverage,
classification, and sectorization. The CBS started to include the Swaziland Building Society into the
monetary data backdated to December 2006. However, the credit and savings cooperatives, representing
about 8 percent of assets of the commercial banks, remain outside the deposit corporations’ survey.
External sector statistics: Quarterly balance of payments statistics are compiled by the CBS according to a
methodology consistent with the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5). However,
shortcomings in the timeliness and availability of trade data impart a certain degree of uncertainty to
external sector statistics and surveillance. The errors and omissions term is sizable and further actions are
required to improve the accuracy and reliability of external sector data.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Participant in the General Data Dissemination

No data ROSC is available.

System (GDDS) since February 11, 2003.
III. Reporting to STA
The CBS reports monetary and financial statistics to STA regularly, although the timeliness of data could
be improved. Balance of payments data are published in International Financial Statistics (IFS) and in the
Balance of Payments Yearbook.

Statement by Ms. Kapwepwe, Executive Director for the Kingdom of Swaziland,
and Ms. Dlamini-Kunene, Alternate Executive Director
December 9, 2015

We thank Staff for the candid and productive engagement during the Article IV mission in
Mbabane. My authorities value Fund engagement and are in broad agreement with the
assessment and conclusions of the Staff report. They share similar concerns on the challenges
facing the country given the volatility of revenues from the Southern African Customs Union
(SACU) and the need to strengthen the country’s resilience to shocks.
Despite recent challenges, the Kingdom of Swaziland has made significant socio-economic
achievements over the recent years. The authorities have enhanced agricultural production by
increasing area under irrigation especially on Swazi Nation Land for small holders by
constructing large and medium-sized dams including, the development of the Maguga dam
and the Lubovane dams under the KOBWA LUSIP Projects respectively. The quality of road
infrastructure has improved connectivity of the major towns, main border gates and rural
settlements. In addition, access to electricity has improved in all parts of the country and
more that 75 percent of the population has access to clean water. The authorities have also
rolled out universal primary school education to grade 7 and access to free Anti-Retroviral
Therapy has more than doubled.
Going forward, the challenge for the authorities will be consolidating these achievements and
ensuring that the pace of growth is commensurate with the desired social and economic
transformation of the Kingdom. Therefore, the focus of the authorities is to build a strong and
resilient economy. In this regard, they concur with staff that the need to pursue a reform path
that anchors fiscal and debt sustainability while supporting growth in the medium to long
term.
Recent economic developments and outlook
Economic activity is estimated to have slowed, with GDP growth rate decreasing from 2.9
percent in 2013 to 2.4 percent in 2014, mainly due to poor performance in the primary sector
and loss of momentum in the tertiary sector. The primary sector is estimated to have
contracted by 3.2 percent in 2014 due to poor crop production, especially citrus, and poor
performance in the livestock sector.

2
The current account continued to improve in the third quarter of 2015 mainly due to higher
current transfers inflows of which SACU accounted for about 63 percent. Gross official
reserves increased markedly in October by 11.8 percent to E9 billion compared to the E8
billion recorded in September 2015 and were enough to cover an estimated 3.9 months of
imports.
The authorities have been exercising prudent borrowing principles. In this regard, while
public debt has edged up slightly in recent months, Swaziland’s public debt remains low
around 18 percent of GDP and significantly lower than the authorities’ 35 percent limit. To
further strengthen debt management the authorities have established a Public Debt
Management Unit (operational since April 2015) to guide Government Ministries and
Agencies on contracting and managing public debt.
Growth in 2015 is expected to slow down to 1.7 percent, mainly due to slower growth in the
secondary and tertiary sectors while the primary sector is projected to grow by 6.5 percent,
benefitting from positive growth in commercial agriculture and forestry. However,
subsistence and livestock farming are expected to be affected by the drought conditions. The
outlook will be compromised by the continued slowdown of the South African economy, the
country’s major trading partner and drought in the region. For Swaziland, the drought will
affect the agriculture and construction sectors. In addition, the projected contraction in SACU
revenue will exert pressure on the fiscal revenues and negatively affect the economy.
Fiscal policy and reforms
After experiencing a fiscal crisis in 2010/11 mainly due to a significant decline of almost
25% in revenues from SACU, the government has undertaken various fiscal reforms and
Swaziland’s budgetary outturn has since improved. At the same time, domestic revenue
mobilization has improved significantly following the establishment of the Swaziland
Revenue Authority (SRA). Domestic revenues have performed better than targets driven by
higher than expected income tax and VAT collections.
The authorities pursued fiscal consolidation for two consecutive fiscal years following the
crisis and adopted an expansionary fiscal stance for 2015/16 to support the implementation of
their development agenda articulated in the Vision 2022. Their main focus was to implement
priority development programs over the medium term, with emphasis on education, health,
agriculture, infrastructure and improving the conditions for private sector investment. The
anticipated decrease in SACU revenue presents additional risks to government revenues. The
authorities are cognizant of these developments and having experienced a similar crisis in
2010/11, are aware of the need to take early precautionary steps and practice fiscal prudence
to safeguard confidence. This would be achieved through measures including by reviewing
spending priorities, containing recurrent spending, rationalize the wage bill, enhance
domestic revenue collection and enhance available financing.
Among the main challenges, the wage bill remains a major concern. The authorities are
exploring all possible measures, including a wage and hiring freeze across all sectors for the
remainder of 2015. In the near-term, deferring and/or closing unused positions. They also

3
intend to minimize expenditure on goods and services to only essential items that
substantially improve government objectives and maximize savings. On the revenue side, the
authorities intend to amend the Income Tax regulations and introduce a levy on alcohol and
tobacco. In addition, an amendment to the Tax Law to reduce tax exemptions has been
submitted to Parliament.
Public finance management
The Public Finance Management (PFM) Bill has been finalized and resubmitted to
Parliament. The Bill is expected to establish a comprehensive and stronger legal framework
for managing public resources, and to empower spending agencies to take full responsibility
and accountability of their budgets. In addition, implementation of a new financial
management IT and accounting system, with the support of the IMF, World Bank and
European Union, will support the implementation and improve transparency and
accountability in the use of public resources. At the same time, the authorities remain
committed to improving efficiencies in the procurement and cash management process.
Monetary and exchange rate policies
As a member of the Common Monetary Area, Swaziland does not have an independent
monetary policy. The Central Bank of Swaziland (CBS) continued to pursue a monetary
policy in line with the monetary stance of the South African Reserve Bank. For the first nine
months of 2015, the CBS tightened monetary policy increasing rates twice by a cumulative
50 basis points. On the exchange rate policy, the authorities view the exchange rate peg to the
South African rand as an appropriate monetary policy anchor. In this regard, they will
continue to maintain official international reserves at above 3 months of imports with the
intention to increase the reserves to 6-7 months of imports in the medium to long term. They
intend to continue to protect the peg by undertaking the necessary fiscal measures that will
strengthen the economy’s resilience against potential external shocks and to further
strengthen policy buffers.
Financial sector developments and policies
The banking sector is liquid, well capitalized, highly profitable and compliant with regulatory
requirements. The quality of banking sector assets has been improving since the 2010/11
fiscal crisis and non performing loans (NPLs) have declined from 10.7 percent during the
crisis to 6.9 percent. Credit extension to the private sector is reflective of the structure of the
economy which is driven by the sugar sector in agriculture manufacturing and services. The
banking system though sound is susceptible to developments in the price of sugar, SACU
revenues which influence the consumer confidence and implications on reserves.
The authorities recognize that given the rapid growth and size, the non-bank financial
institutions (NBFIs) are becoming systemically important and that the strong linkages
between the NBFIs and banks warrant closer supervision. Therefore, to safeguard financial
sector stability the regulatory authorities, the CBS and the Financial Services Regulatory
Authority (FSRA) have strengthened their collaboration. The central bank has established a

4
financial stability unit which liaises with FSRA on stability related issues. The CBS has also
adopted a risk based supervisory framework for banks and has commenced risked based
supervision. In addition FSRA is in the process of strengthening the regulatory framework of
the NBFIs.
Building a strong and resilient economy
In light of Swaziland’s protracted periods of slow economic growth and vulnerability to
external shocks, the authorities acknowledge that the focus should be more on facilitating and
nurturing the private sector to thrive in a stable fiscal environment. They recognize the need
for an attractive investment climate, based on sound macroeconomic policies and fiscal
discipline, leading to accelerated economic growth. They are committed to implementing
structural reforms that will transform the private and public sectors to promote private
investment and an expansion of the tradable goods sector. At the same, they will seek to
enhance the development of the human resources, to create greater labor market flexibility,
and to place a new emphasis on industrial and infrastructural development.
Structural reforms undertaken in the past aimed at improving competitiveness, especially on
trade facilitation have yielded results, as Swaziland’s ranking for the World Bank Ease of
Doing Business improved by 24 places. However, the authorities realize that more still needs
to be done. To harness private sector investment, in particular unlocking private finance for
infrastructure development they have developed a Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) Policy.
In addition, given the prevailing electricity crisis in South Africa, the authorities are
exploring the possibility of increasing energy co-generation by sugar mills, timber producers
and others to supply the national grid. In this context, the authorities are reviewing the legal
framework to provide an enabling environment and incentivize participation both at strategic
generation and distribution levels.
Conclusion
Though Swaziland seems to have recovered from the 2010/11 fiscal crisis, the challenge now
is how to respond to the looming shortfall in SACU revenues, especially when the fiscal
buffers have not been sufficiently restored. The authorities remain committed to supporting
and ensuring a more inclusive and sustainable economic growth. In this regard, my
authorities realize the need to pursue sound macroeconomic policies and undertake structural
reforms that will reduce the country’s susceptibility to external shocks and reduce
dependency on the volatile SACU revenues. They appreciate the ongoing Fund advice and
Technical Assistance.
