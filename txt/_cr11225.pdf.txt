SPILLOVER REPORT FOR THE 2011 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
July 11, 2011

KEY POINTS
Issues. Spillover reports explore the external effects of policies in systemic economies,
focusing on concerns raised by key partners. In the case of the U.K., these mainly relate to
(i) the extent to which the financial sector might be a source or conduit of shocks to the rest
of the world, (ii) the impact of U.K. supervision and regulatory policies on efforts to
strengthen global financial stability.
Findings. The main messages flowing from staff analysis are:


The size and interconnectedness of the U.K. financial sector make it a powerful
originator, transmitter, and potential dampener of global shocks. The U.K.
agglomerates core international financial functions making it a key node in “funding”
liquidity and balance sheet hedging, providing buoyancy to global markets and
acting as a key channel transmitting shocks or stabilizing measures.



The stability and efficiency of the U.K. financial sector is therefore a global
public good, requiring the highest quality supervision and regulation. Significant
efforts to strengthen supervision will help contain the risks to global stability posed
by the sector’s size and complexity. Stronger liquidity, capital and leverage rules
should dampen credit cycles and lower systemic risk, as can the U.K.’s
macroprudential policies.



International co-operation is critical if the U.K. is to fulfill its potential to
support global stability. U.K. financial stability will be weakened (with adverse
spillovers) if EU rules constrain U.K. financial regulations at insufficiently ambitious
levels or if they limit the ability to use macro-prudential instruments to address
emerging risks. Cooperation (both within and outside the EU) would help limit
regulatory arbitrage, while development of cross-border resolution frameworks can
limit shock propagation through the U.K. if tail risks materialize. Effective home-host
co-ordination would also reduce the risk of fragmented pools of liquidity hampering
parent banks’ ability to support branches/subsidiaries in periods of stress.



The U.K. authorities can make a significant contribution to the surveillance of
global systemic risks. The size and role of the U.K. financial sector puts them at an
informational advantage, although data gaps and resources pose challenges.

SPILLOVER REPORTS?
Spillover reports examine the external effects of domestic policies in five systemic economies,
i.e., the S5, comprising China, Euro Area, Japan, United Kingdom, and the United States.
The mere existence of external effects does not imply that policy modifications or collective
action is needed------that depends on many considerations, including the presence of
economic externalities. The aim rather is to stimulate discussion, providing a global
perspective for policy advice in Article IV discussions and input for the Fund’s broader
multilateral surveillance. In each case, key partners are asked about outward spillovers from
the economy in question, on the basis of which staff choose issues for analysis. To facilitate
candor, spillover reports do not cite who raises a specific issue. For this report, the consulted
were officials and analysts from the other S5 and from selected financial centers------Brazil,
Hong Kong SAR, India, Indonesia, Korea, Mexico, Poland, Russia, Singapore, Thailand and
U.A.E.
This report does not try to capture the full extent of the influence of the United Kingdom on
the world economy. Rather, it focuses on a few forward-looking issues raised by partners,
brings to bear relevant analysis, and describes the reactions of the U.K. authorities. Technical
papers underlying the analysis can be found in the Supplement to this paper. A separate
forthcoming report summarizes the themes emerging from discussions with the S5.

I. CONTEXT
1.
This report examines the systemic impact of the U.K.’s economic and financial
sector policies on the global economy. The U.K.’s potential for spillovers is concentrated in
the financial sector. Though the U.K. is the fifth largest economy in the world at about 4
percent of global GDP the potential for systemic spillovers from the real economy is limited
despite the economy’s comparative openness to trade. This is not to deny that real spillovers
to a number of close partner economies could be significant.
2.
Growth spillovers to the other S5 economies are moderate and concentrated on
the euro-area in normal times. Spillovers to other G20 economies also appear moderate

(see Supplement, notes VI and VII). A
structural model suggests that the
peak impulse responses of output to a
range of shocks in the U.K. tend to
increase with geographical proximity
to the U.K., and is larger for financial
shocks than for real shocks. The

strong trade linkages, and there is also
some impact on South Africa (see Figure 1). A sharp but contained increase in U.K. sovereign
bond yields –a scenario simulated across the spillover reports for advanced economies—
would likely have only a limited impact on bond yields and growth elsewhere (see
Supplement, Note VIII). The Article IV staff report suggests that the government’s fiscal
consolidation plan has significantly reduced the risk of such an event.
3.
Spillovers could be much greater for a range of non-systemic economies that
are heavily dependent on trade with the U.K. Model results are unavailable for these
countries, but their high share of exports destined for the U.K. suggests they could face
sizable spillovers. Examples include Ireland, Iceland, Norway, and much of the
Commonwealth. Spillovers through transfers are also likely to be significant to low income
countries (LICs), particularly in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), which derive around 10 percent of
their aid and remittances from the U.K. (See annex 1).

4.
The more substantial systemic spillovers are expected to arise from U.K.
financial sector developments and policies.1 The remainder of the report lays out the
channels through which U.K. markets, institutions, and policies influence the rest of the
world, seen both from staff’s analysis, U.K. partners’ concerns, and the authorities’ reactions.
II. THE U.K. FINANCIAL SECTOR’S SYSTEMIC ROLE
Size and role
5.
The U.K. lies at the center of global finance, with U.K.-based banks playing a
leading role in global financial intermediation. It ranks third world-wide in terms of
external assets, which are mostly loans, debt securities and derivatives. This reflects U.K.based banks’ domination of cross-border lending, particularly to other financial institutions
(See Supplement, Note I). The U.K. also hosts critical markets and financial infrastructure. It is
the center of global foreign exchange (37 percent of global turnover) and money markets
(Libor market) and the dominant location for trading international bonds2 and derivatives.
(see Figure 3 and Supplement, Note II) This agglomeration of financial services has
encouraged the development of trading platforms and supporting infrastructure including
FX clearing and settlement systems, and the world’s largest central counterparties (CCPs).
High capacity to transmit shocks

a significant generator of “funding”

markets. Figure 2, which shows net

Like the companion FSSA, this report takes a broad definition of the U.K. financial sector, financial
institutions based in the U.K.—whether U.K. owned or not—as well as the operations of subsidiaries
and branches of U.K. banks abroad.

more than half of global funding generation during the boom, implying that a shock to their
activity would have large global repercussions.3 This owes in part to the broad capacity to
rehypothecate collateral in the U.K., which helps generate leverage and transmit liquidity
through the financial system (see U.K. FSSA update).
7.
In supporting this generation of liquidity, foreign-owned banks in the U.K.
leverage their balance sheets, but in their deleveraging transmit shocks. The tendency

8.
The global transmission consequent on this deleveraging derives from the high
degree of interconnectedness of the U.K. with the rest of the world—particularly
Europe. A standard approach to network analysis based on BIS data on international claims
Figure 5. Propagation of Shocks
shows the U.K.’s links are strongest with
the Eurozone, but still significant with
the U.S., Cayman Islands (a key offshore
center for U.S. banks) and Japan, and
smaller financial centers (Figure 5).4 The
results are driven by business models of
the large international banks many of
which rely on U.K.-based entities to
intermediate global flows, in particular
those between the U.S. and the EU
(Supplement, Note V).
9.
U.K.-based banks deleveraged early, and accounted for 27 percent of the
decline in cross-border lending through the first half of 2009 (Figure 6).5 Simulation
analysis (see Supplement, Note IX) suggests that such shocks are likely to have a severe
effect on countries that depend on the U.K. for short-term funding, particularly financial
centers (Hong Kong, Luxemburg and Cyprus). There is also likely to be a large impact on
other EU states. Ireland is the most extreme case, with “upstream exposure” (a measure of
countries’ vulnerabilities to rollover risks from direct cross-border bank lending, and lending
by foreign affiliates) to the U.K. exceeding 50 percent of its GDP. But exposure is also
significant (5-10 percent of GDP) for large Euro-Area countries such as France and Spain.

See Understanding Financial Interconnectedness (2010) for further elaboration on the methodology.
Espinosa-Vega and Sole (2010) illustrates how financial interconnections can amplify shocks through
successive reductions in funding.

10.
The bond market represents an additional important channel of transmission of
financial shocks. Structural Vector Autoregression (SVAR) results for 10-year government
bond yields point to a significant role of the U.K. bond market: more than 50 percent of the
initial yield shock in the U.K. spills over to euro area yields, and to a smaller extent to the
U.S. and Japan (Figure 7). Given the finding
reported above regarding spillovers from a
U.K. sovereign shock (paragraph 2), this
result is driven by the large volumes of nonUK sovereign bonds traded in London.
Equity market spillovers, while significant,
are found to be smaller and less persistent.
(Supplement, Note VI)
Impact of shocks from the U.K.
11.
A shock originating in the U.K. would similarly have sizeable cross-border
effects, particularly on global financial centers.6 Changes to the perceived
creditworthiness of U.K.-owned banks, proxied by CDS spreads, might lead to spillovers on
financial institutions that either trade with them or are seen as having similar business
models. The relationship can be quantified through a conditional probability of distress
(CoPoD) approach, which examines how shocks to the CDS spreads of one bank in the U.K.
impact those of financial institutions elsewhere (Figure 8 and Supplement, Note X).

The CoPoD analysis confirms that the larger global U.K.-owned banks have a substantial
impact on the rest of the world, exceeding that of more domestically focused institutions.
They have greatest spillovers on financial institutions in the Euro-Area and emerging Europe,
with less of an effect on Latin America or Asia.
12.
Shocks from the U.K. have also had a large impact on measures of global
financial market risk, explaining

component analysis to estimate the extent to which unobservable shifts in common risk factors contribute to
that this analysis reflects the U.K.’s
role both as a transmitter of shocks and an originator (see Supplement, Note XI).
III. PARTNER CONCERNS
13.
The U.K.’s potential to transmit shocks and to contribute to global financial
stability is recognized in other financial centers. Many of them suffered liquidity drains

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED KINGDOM - 2011 SPILLOVER REPORT

from U.K.-based banks during the recent global crisis. Some financial institutions that had
ready access to the U.K. interbank market when liquidity was buoyant were forced to
deleverage when their credit lines were cut. Strengthened supervision and tighter regulation
in the U.K. were thought likely to contribute to efforts to strengthen global financial stability.
Over and above the U.K.’s own policies, interlocutors also recognized the role played by the
U.K. in forging the intellectual case for ambitious global financial reforms. Outside financial
centers, however, some did not see any exceptionality in the U.K. financial sector and
downplayed its impact on Europe and the rest of the world.
14.
Foreign regulators did not feel that the U.K. should draw back from reform for
fear of losing business to other jurisdictions. Most thought that the pull factor of strong
emerging market growth was the major explanation for the rising share of financial activity
in Asia, with push factors such as regulatory changes of secondary importance. The
agglomeration effects binding financial institutions to the U.K. were seen as powerful, and so
the U.K. could contribute to global stability without unduly undermining its competitive
position. However, market participants warned that should the U.K. exceed materially Basel
III and other international regulatory agreements, some might consider the possibility of
moving activities outside of the U.K. A number of interlocutors were concerned that
measures to address too important to fail (TITF) institutions—such as ring-fencing of capital,
liquidity or retail operations—could strengthen stability in the U.K. at the expense of other
jurisdictions as improving resolvability of the U.K. entity does not necessarily improve
resolvability of the whole entity, could limit resources available to solve problems elsewhere
in the group, and create trapped pools of liquidity.
IV. POLICY SPILLOVERS
15.
The U.K. has embarked on a major financial sector reform program—that could
have important spillovers, at least transitionally. The effort is domestically focused, but
aligned with the imperatives of global stability. Reforms range across supervision, regulation
(including liquidity and capital buffers), and TITF policies. As these reforms impact all “U.K.based intermediaries”, they affect the business models that use the U.K. for global asset and
liability management. The scale and nature of policy spillovers from the U.K. however will be
influenced by the policies of other jurisdictions. Uncertainty about the latter—in particular
how the EU will go about implementing Basel III (under a new directive “CRD4”)—creates
uncertainties about the extent of spillovers from U.K. policies.
16.
Event studies suggest that markets have been keenly aware of the potential
cross-border impact of regulatory changes in the U.K. A systemic risk survey compiled by
the Bank of England in the immediate wake of the crisis indicated that financial institutions

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 11

UNITED KINGDOM - 2011 SPILLOVER Report

saw regulatory and accounting changes as among the top five risks to the U.K. financial
system, and one of the two hardest risks for them to manage.7 While LIBOR-OIS, a common
indicator of liquidity risk, did not immediately react to announcements on changes in U.K.
regulation on liquidity standards, other risk measures moved sharply.8 The average price to
book value of systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs) with a universal banking
and investment banking business model relative to their home country index fell sharply on
key dates coinciding with announcements or changes in the U.K.’s liquidity regulations (See
Supplement, Note XII) . A similar effect is seen in the price of hedging against tail risk in key
currencies used by global SIFIs in intermediation of most markets via the U.K.
Prudential Oversight
17.
Reforms to strengthen supervision will critically help contain the risks to global
stability arising from the size and complexity of the U.K. financial sector. The build-up
of systemic risks in the mid-2000s, including the rise of the shadow banking sector, was
possible in part due to the U.K.’s “light touch” supervisory approach. In response, the
authorities have begun to increase the resources devoted to supervision and strengthen
stress testing, with further efforts required. Maintaining and building upon these
improvements should help contain the risk of distress in U.K.-based banks and potential
collateral damage abroad.
18.
Strong supervision of CCPs is particularly important if tail risks are to be
contained.9 If soundly run and regulated, CCPs could both lower and make more
transparent the level of risk in derivatives (See Supplement, Note II). But CCPs also represent
large risk nodes, that could face severe liquidity needs and potential losses if a large market
participant were to default. Such a situation, if mishandled, could have systemic implications.
Establishing an appropriate resolution framework, while ensuring that CCPs have adequate
risk management and access to sufficient liquidity during crises will support these efforts.

7

Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin, 2009 Q3.

As suggested in the Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin (2009, Q4), this may be the result of Libor
fixings being less indicative of actual transacted rates between banks and as such underestimating
true cost of funding.

8

Adequate regulation and supervision of other critical pieces of market infrastructure is also essential
to prevent adverse spillovers. This includes, for instance, CHAPS, the U.K.’s real-time gross settlement
system, which provides settlement services for CLS (one of the key global clearers of forex payments).

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED KINGDOM - 2011 SPILLOVER REPORT

Liquidity and leverage
19.
The tightening of U.K. liquidity rules will constrain SIFIs, dampen the credit
cycle, and should help lower systemic risks. The new, tougher approach in the U.K.
approximates the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) in Basel III, but the range of assets classified
as liquid is narrower, and the required “stress survival period” at three months is longer.10
Maintaining liquid buffers in several jurisdictions, including the U.K, may raise the aggregate
costs of liquidity for SIFIs. The rules regarding intra-group relationships have also been
tightened, with supervisors factoring them into assessments of liquidity only if the entity can
demonstrate reliable access to group resources. In principle, the new rules should help lower
the probability and severity of possible future global crises, although the magnitude of this
effect is hard to quantify, and seems subject to diminishing returns.11
20.
Such rules, while key to domestic and global stability, may also accelerate
deleveraging, increase intermediation spreads, and lead to tighter credit standards. An
assessment of upstream exposure, highlights very significant levels of funding dependence
for a number of key jurisdictions (Figure 10). As it excludes (due to data constraints)
dependence that arises from branches and subsidiaries, it provides a lower bound on the
impact of a funding shock.
Figure 10. Upstream Exposure to U.K. Banks (in percent of GDP), September 2010

Supervisors are also applying stress tests (using firm-specific and market-wide shocks) to review
firms’ own assessments of liquidity needs.

21.
An unintended consequence of the U.K.’s pursuit of self-sufficiency in liquidity
could be the emergence of trapped pools of liquidity, potentially detrimental to global
financial stability. If the U.K. tightens liquidity standards and other regulators follow suit, it
could become more complicated for global SIFIs to protect subsidiaries in the event of
shocks. This risk may be mitigated, however, if in co-ordination with home supervisors, U.K.
supervisors exercise discretion and modify liquidity requirements in recognition of reliable
access to group resources.
22.
If imposed, a cap on leverage interacting with the policy intention of increased
“self-sufficiency” of U.K. based institutions, could also lower risks. The Basel III
agreement assumes that limits on the leverage ratio would enter into force in 2019, although
it is unclear if the EU will include this measure in CRD4. If introduced in the U.K., it could limit
procyclical expansions in leverage and impose efficiency costs on SIFIs funding themselves
through intra-group transactions. However, the impact would depend upon how it is defined
and calibrated, in particular whether it is applied at the solo level, as well as to consolidated
balance sheets. The former approach could have a more powerful effect by capturing intragroup transactions. A cap on on-balance sheet leverage might also provide an incentive to
financial institutions to increase their reliance on off-balance sheet funding sources
(Supplement, Note V).
Capital
23.
Given the size of balance sheets in the U.K., increased capital requirements
could also contribute to global financial stability. As is the case for liquidity, increasing
capital buffers should lower the risk of and size of crises, although the impact will depend
upon whether they are applied at the solo or consolidated level.12 Increased capital
requirements could also carry benefits in normal times by dampening shocks transmitted by
the U.K. financial sector and lowering the volatility of output.13 New capital requirements for
globally important SIFIs will apply to the nodes in the financial network that can most rapidly
propagate—or potentially ameliorate—the impact of shocks.
24.
The output costs arising from higher capital requirements in the U.K. are likely
to be modest and possibly transitory as banks adjust to the new standards. They arise
from deleveraging, increased intermediation spreads and a tightening in credit standards,
mitigated by changes in bank behavior (Figure 11, see Supplement, Note XIII). Simulations

Macroprudential policies
25.
The U.K. also seems well placed to contribute to the implementation of global
macroprudential policies. The Financial Policy Committee (FPC), the body set up to
implement macroprudential policies in the U.K., while having a mandate focused on
domestic financial stability, is expected to consider the outward spillovers of its decisions, in
particular possible feedback effects on the U.K. financial system.14 The FPC will be
responsible for the U.K. implementation of the Basel III agreement on a countercyclical
capital buffer (the only instrument on which there is international agreement so far), which
will provide banks with more capital to withstand potential losses after a credit bubble.
26.
The FPC can deliver this role through “jurisdictional reciprocity”, a process for
ensuring that macroprudential policies are not arbitraged. As credit cycles vary sharply
across economies, so will appropriate macroprudential standards in each jurisdiction. Any
authority opting to apply measures to credit exposures will inform foreign counterparts so
they ensure that their banks apply them to relevant exposures. The U.K.’s involvement in this
process, whether for credit cycle risks or other systemic issues, would help ensure that
internationally active banks do not, for instance, circumvent rules in one country by booking
transactions through the U.K.

14

The FPC will also analyze financial sector vulnerabilities more generally, and make proposals on
information gathering or microprudential measures complementing macroprudential policies.

Managing Tail Risks: TITF institutions and Cross-border resolution
27.
A number of U.K. initiatives to address tail risks could have spillover effects. A
requirement that banks develop recovery and resolution plans (RRPs, also known as living
wills) could help reduce the risks in the event that a complex institution fails and needs to be
broken up. If adopted, the recommendations of the interim report of the Independent
Commission on Banking could also have a significant impact on the capital requirements
and organization of some internationally active U.K. banks.
28.
However, the absence of an effective cross-border resolution framework raises
particular concerns that U.K.-based institutions could propagate shocks in situations of
stress. At present, EU regulations governing the “single market” and “passporting”
arrangements limit the options for the U.K. (and other member states) to regulate and
supervise U.K. banks that are branches of banks headquartered elsewhere in the EU. Thus, if
a parent experiences distress, there is a risk of its U.K.-based branches causing disruption,
and vice versa. The present system of “home country” control and resolution does not
provide effective incentives for cross-border supervision and resolution, because the
absence of ex ante burden sharing arrangements could induce home authorities to neglect
prudential developments in other member states. This is a particular issue for the U.K.
because it is host to so many branches15, over which the authorities have limited powers.
Nevertheless, it would be hard for the authorities to exercise restraint in the case of an
inadequate response by home states. The absence of harmonized resolution frameworks,
within or beyond the EU, may induce the U.K. to ring-fence in times of crisis resulting in a
suboptimal resolution for groups, exacerbating spillovers.16
29.
New spillover effects could emerge if the U.K. becomes a base for financial
innovation to arbitrage new global regulations. Its track record at creating new financial
products, facilitated by the clustering of services and the depth of markets, makes it a
natural location for such activity. New risks might arise if, for example, provisions in the U.S.
Dodd-Frank act encouraging the spin-off of proprietary trading and derivatives activity;
cross-border differences in margin requirements for derivative trades not cleared through

15

The U.K. authorities have, by contrast, full powers to resolve foreign subsidiaries.

A recent proposal from the European Commission could alleviate some of these concerns. It would
harmonize EU Member States’ legal and institutional arrangements for managing banking crises,
bringing closer an integrated framework for crisis prevention, management and resolution.

CCPs; or, differences in the cross-border application of leverage limits, leads to the riskiest
activity re-emerging in London17 (see U.S. spillover report for evidence of such risk).
V. FACTORS DAMPENING OR MODIFYING FINANCIAL-SECTOR SPILLOVERS
30.
Spillovers could be dampened if financial activity progressively moved to other
jurisdictions. Strong economic growth in emerging markets is spurring a shift in global
financial activity, particularly to Asia. This trend could be amplified by a prolonged period of
uncertainty about U.K. financial sector policies, or if eventual taxation and regulatory
decisions drive a large wedge between operating costs in the U.K. and those of other
jurisdictions. A fragmentation of SIFIs’ activities would diminish the share of global
intermediation falling in the U.K. regulatory net, lead to risks falling between the regulatory
cracks if other regulators do not widen the regulatory perimeter or developing a
comprehensive view of complex institutions becomes more difficult, and complicate the U.K.
authorities’ efforts to assess global systemic risks.
31.
However, powerful agglomeration effects underpin the U.K.’s competitive
position, reducing the incentives to relocate. The academic literature finds that financial
centers are created by clustering effects because of the positive externalities from
information sharing and proximity to customers18; in the U.K.’s case, further externalities
arise from market infrastructure and the availability of skilled labor. The few examples of
precipitous declines in financial centers have resulted either from severe political instability
or a shift in activities from regions to national capitals, rather than regulatory change. So far,
no SIFIs have moved out of the U.K., with relocation to date limited largely to hedge funds
going to Switzerland. While the U.K. will probably lose market share to fast-growing
emerging markets, the pace could be slow, and will depend upon the extent to which any
tightening in regulation is matched by other jurisdictions.
32.
Insufficiently strong or insufficiently flexible EU rules would also hinder U.K.
efforts to strengthen financial sector regulations, leading to potentially larger
spillovers.19 If CRD4 requires common regulatory standards across the EU that are not
sufficiently strong (above Basel III minima) or does not allow sufficient flexibility for national
authorities to use a range of macroprudential tools to mitigate systemic risks (which, to be
effective, requires the European Systemic Risk Board to play a prominent role in ensuring
The U.K. authorities are aware of such risks, and are monitoring the possible consequences of, for
instance, new funding products that comply with revised liquidity regulations, but could create sizable
rollover risks just beyond regulatory horizons (See Bank of England Financial Stability Report (2010)).

home-host coordination and reciprocity), the U.K.’s ability to implement strong regulations
to avoid financial instability will be reduced, increasing the spillovers from such instability.
VI. THE U.K. IN GLOBAL SURVEILLANCE—A UNIQUE LENS
33.
The U.K. has unique informational advantages that in principle could
strengthen the work of fora charged with the surveillance of emerging systemic risks.
The intersection of U.K. oversight of global intermediaries—though lack of information on
the activities of branches is a blind spot— with the hosting of markets and infrastructure
provides the U.K. with unique perspectives on global intermediation. There is considerable
scope to draw further information from existing data sources. As a treasury hub, trends in
cross-border source and use of funds; U.S. dollar and dollar-linked trading; the quality of
collateral being pooled and posted in transactions; the cross-border direction of risk
mitigation strategies; and, developments in the Libor/OIS markets can be gleaned from
operations and markets in the U.K. In addition, the U.K. authorities could potentially observe
some risks in less-regulated areas, such as hedge fund activity, which the FSA periodically
surveys. While in principle, the U.K. could try to dampen global cycles, its impact would be
enhanced though international coordination. As a host supervisor of a subsidiary in a
consolidated group, it has the right to demand even higher buffers if it considers that those
proposed by the national supervisor are inadequate or have not been applied quickly
enough. However, coordination with partner macro-prudential authorities in managing
global risk will likely yield more effective results and help reconcile situations where global
financial stability and domestic stability considerations do not coincide. In addition, the U.K.
could be a major contributor to international work streams monitoring the evolution of use
of Intra-Group Guarantees and the Booking Practices of SIFIs to trace how cross-border risks
relocate. Finally, the U.K. authorities’ capacity to address such risks might be hampered if
CRD4 overly constrains the use of a range of macroprudential instruments in response to
emerging risks.
VII. AUTHORITIES’ REACTIONS
34.
The U.K. authorities welcomed the pilot spillover exercise for the major
systemic economies, which bridges an important gap between the Fund’s bilateral and
multilateral surveillance. The authorities noted the timeliness of the U.K. spillovers analysis
given the changing domestic and global financial landscape. They also recognized that the
report has been a particular challenge because of data limitations, the inherent complexity of
the subject, and the lack of existing empirical work on the spillovers from the U.K. financial
sector to other countries.
35.
U.K.

18

The authorities concurred with the staff analysis that the size and role of the
financial system in global intermediation, underpinned by powerful

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED KINGDOM - 2011 SPILLOVER REPORT

agglomeration effects, has important implications for the origination, transmission
and dampening of shocks to the global financial system. They noted, however, that care
was needed in the interpretation of spillovers emanating from U.K. headquartered
institutions or domestic policy as distinct from the U.K. “host” functions as a recipient or a
global conduit of shocks that originate from elsewhere. The authorities stressed that this
work should serve as a good foundation for more in-depth analysis, for example on the
impact of country-specific policies on the functioning of global liquidity.
36.
The authorities agreed with the staff analysis that the overhaul of U.K.
regulation and oversight, while domestically focused, is appropriately aligned with the
imperatives of global stability, a view that is also consistent with the U.K. FSAP report.
They recognized that the action taken domestically on capital and liquidity policy has an
impact on global asset and liability management, and welcomed the staff judgment that the
resulting benefits to global as well as U.K. financial stability exceed any potential liquidity
efficiency costs.
37.
However, the authorities underlined that the U.K. can only do so much on its
own and that strong cooperation with and reform by global partners are needed to
secure stability. Indeed, they echoed the direct EU-level financial stability risks set out in the
report, which have the potential to cause and magnify spillovers from the U.K. In particular
those risks arising from EU passporting arrangements in the event of less ambitious EU/EEA
standards and from CRD4 limiting the scope for appropriate national discretion in policy
making.
38.
The U.K. authorities agreed that the concentration of activities in the U.K.
presents some coordination and informational benefits compared to a more globally
fragmented financial landscape. However, they emphasized that effective global
surveillance and regulation ultimately requires sustained international cooperation and
action, including by all key global financial centers and through ongoing workstreams and
processes in international bodies like the IMF, FSB and ESRB. The U.K. authorities could also
feed into this through the market intelligence it collects from its regular contact with the
private sector in London. More broadly, the authorities confirmed their intention to continue
taking a strong leadership role in policy discussions in these fora.
VIII. CONCLUSIONS
39.
The size and role of the U.K. financial system allows it to originate, transmit,
and potentially dampen risks and shocks to the global financial system. The
agglomeration of core functions found in the U.K. makes it a central node in “funding”
liquidity and balance sheet hedging, providing buoyancy to global markets (and as such
contributing to the buildup of global risk)—but equally able to withdraw it abruptly, as

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 19

UNITED KINGDOM - 2011 SPILLOVER Report

became evident in the crisis. By the same token, any shock originating from the U.K. financial
sector would have material implications throughout the global financial system.
40.
The stability and efficiency of the U.K. financial sector is therefore a global
public good, requiring the highest quality supervision and regulation. Significant efforts
are underway to strengthen U.K. supervision, particularly of on-site inspections. Stronger
liquidity and capital buffers as envisaged will dampen risks and shocks originated or
transmitted through the U.K. financial sector, as will improved resolution regimes. That said,
given the U.K.'s role, policies that limit leverage and require financial institutions to be more
“self-sufficient” in liquidity will affect business models that use the U.K. for global asset and
liability management, although the stability benefits will likely exceed potential global
efficiency costs.
41.
For optimal results, implementation of this agenda requires cooperation and
coordination with global partners. Cooperation is key with all major financial centers,
particularly so with the EU. U.K. financial stability will be weakened (with adverse spillovers) if
EU rules constrain U.K. financial regulations at insufficiently ambitious levels or if they limit
the ability to use a range of macroprudential instruments to address emerging risks.
Similarly, very close home-host supervisor cooperation is essential to ensure that EU
passporting arrangements do not undermine financial stability in the U.K. Additionally, the
pursuit of “self-sufficiency” in liquidity, if pursued on a strictly national (rather than groupwide) basis, is useful primarily from the standpoint of domestic stability. However, globally
coordinated approaches would be preferable in order to avoid the risk of fragmented,
trapped, pools of liquidity that could hamper parent banks’ ability to support
branches/subsidiaries in periods of stress. These would be inefficient and could even
increase systemic risk. Thus, it will be important for the U.K. to continue the dialogue with
global partners to develop protocols on access to liquidity in periods of stress. Co-operation
is also required to develop cross-border resolution frameworks that would reduce the risk of
U.K.-based institutions propagating shocks in tail-risk situations.
42.
The U.K. authorities, while in principle uniquely placed to contribute to efforts
at enhanced surveillance of global systemic risks, face important challenges in doing
so in terms of data, resources and authority. The FPC can observe emerging stress and
risks that might arise from the nexus of SIFIs, hedge funds and financial market
infrastructure, but remaining gaps in data on systemic risks, including through the activity of
branches, would need to be addressed. In this regard, vigilance will be needed on risks being
pushed out—in response to regulatory reforms in other jurisdictions—or passported into
deep and innovative U.K. markets. Although naturally focusing on domestic stability issues,
the newly established FPC should take international spillovers into account.

I. THE STRUCTURE OF THE U.K. BANKING SECTOR

1

1.

The United Kingdom is both home and host to systemically important financial

institutions (SIFIs). The “U.K. banking sector” could be defined in several ways (Table 1):
one focused purely on the U.K. based assets, either from U.K. banks or foreign banks’



operations in the U.K. (I+II+III);


one focused on all assets of U.K.-owned banks, in the U.K. and abroad (I+IV+V); or



a combination of both. There is no consensus definition, and various analyses of the U.K.
banking sector may include or exclude any of the items above, depending on the focus.

U.K.-owned and incorporated banks hold significant assets abroad, while foreign bank

subsidiaries and branches hold more than half of U.K.-based banking sector assets (Figure 1):


U.K.-based banking assets are dominated by foreign banks, which hold more than half the
total. Of this amount, European banks hold more than half (54 percent), while U.S. banks
account for 15 percent.



U.K.-owned and incorporated banks represent a small share of U.K.-based banking sector
assets. The top five U.K. banks (HSBC, RBS, Barclays, LBG, and SCB) hold 22 percent of U.K.based banking sector assets, while foreign-owned and U.K. incorporated banks (e.g.,
Santander U.K.) own an additional 27 percent.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 3

UNITED KINGDOM 2011 SPILLOVER REPORT—SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

Only two of the six major U.K.-owned and incorporated banks have a strong domestic focus.



Specifically, LBG and Nationwide operate almost exclusively within U.K. borders. Conversely,
the remaining four major U.K.-owned and incorporated banks have more diversified
geographic profiles.
U.K.-owned and incorporated banks hold significant assets abroad. For example, SCB has less

than 5 percent of its business in the U.K., while HSBC Holdings Plc has significant operations
in the Asian region and other emerging market countries (Figure 2). Separately, Barclays has
increased its exposure to the US, following its acquisition of the Lehman Brothers franchise.
The U.K.-based portion of U.K.-owned and incorporated banks’ assets is less than half of those



banks’ total assets. The five major U.K. banks hold 40–45 percent of U.K.-based banking
sector assets. According to the British Bankers’ Association, the Herfindahl index for the
share of total assets of the five largest credit institutions shows that the U.K. is only the
twenty-third most concentrated EU market.
3.

Foreign banks primarily use London as their international funding and trading

platform. London is a major financial hub, offering a broad range of financial and support services,
a deep talent pool, comprehensive market infrastructure, all located in a convenient time zone. For
these reasons, it is an attractive place for foreign banks to conduct their international investment
banking operations.
4.

There are fewer foreign banks providing traditional loans to the U.K. economy.

Santander U.K (a foreign-owned, U.K. incorporated bank) is a prime example of a foreign bank that
grew through the acquisition of local banks to expand its presence in the U.K. retail market.2 Irish
banks are also active in the U.K. retail market, as are Australian and German banks, lending either to
U.K. households or corporates.

2

For example, Santander U.K. is a U.K.-owned and incorporated bank, established via the acquisitions of

U.K. banks Abbey National, Bradford and Bingley, and Alliance and Leicester. See also Box 1 in the Bank
of England Financial Stability Report (London, June 2010).

5.

The structure of the U.K. banking system has important policy implications, from both

regulatory and supervisory perspectives. For instance, EEA banks hold 27 percent of U.K. based
banking assets. Set up as branches in the United Kingdom, (through “passporting” rules), they
remain under the supervision of their home authority, and the U.K. authorities have very limited
oversight powers over them. Conversely, many U.K.-owned banks have significant activities outside
the U.K. While the U.K. authorities retain consolidated supervision powers over these groups,
individual subsidiaries are also subject to host country supervision and local regulations.

Key Characteristics of U.K. Banks’ Business Models
6.

On an aggregate basis, the major U.K. banks are more exposed to international assets

(45 percent of their balance sheet) than to pure U.K. assets (only 19 percent). The sizeable
international portfolio of the U.K. banks makes them sensitive to economic conditions in Europe, the
U.S. and the rest of the world, and highlights their interconnectedness.
7.

Loans, to households, corporate, and financial institutions represent the bulk of U.K.

banks’ assets, and their share is relatively stable over the last 3 years (Figure 3). The share of
derivatives and securities reached a peak in 2008 and has declined since. Overall, RWA increased
until 2008 and has declined since as banks continue to de-risk their balance sheets.

The U.K. banking sector is polarized in terms of geographic exposures. Three banks

have a strong domestic bias, and four are heavily turned toward international activities. Their
geographic footprints would be relevant for determining where vulnerabilities lie.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 7

UNITED KINGDOM 2011 SPILLOVER REPORT—SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

9.

The major U.K. banks also have very different business models. The seven banks under

review are broadly grouped in two categories: domestic retail banks, with a strong focus on
mortgages, and diversified international banks, combining a wider variety of activities, spanning
from retail to investment banking, wealth management, and insurance.

II. U.K. FINANCIAL MARKETS AND INFRASTRUCTURE

3

10.

London is a dominant actor worldwide in most segments of financial markets (see

Table 2). In particular, U.K. markets, infrastructure, and UK-based institutions have a large or
dominant role across a broad range of global cross-border financial operations. Thus while U.S.
equity and bond markets are larger, they are more domestically focused, while London markets are
dominant in secondary market trading of international bonds or foreign equity listings. London
markets closely related with international banking activities—foreign exchange and derivative
markets in particular—are also the most important globally, and some specialist insurance functions
serving internationally active firms are located there (notably in transportation). Finally and directly
related with the presence of these markets and functions, much of the critical infrastructure of
global finance—in the form of central counterparties (CCPs)—is in London.

U.K.-B ased Central Counterparties
11.

Among the financial market infrastructure located in the U.K., CCPs exhibit the highest

concentration of liquidity and credit risks. They provide an integrated range of clearing functions
to market participants, including the netting of positions. Their core service is to become principal to
every transaction that they clear, which implies that market participants no longer have credit
exposures to their trading counterparties, but only to the CCP. Therefore, CCPs concentrate credit
risk and would face large liquidity needs if a participant defaulted—due to the need to fulfill the
settlement obligations of the defaulting participant, potential losses when the cleared position or
related collateral are liquidated, and the cash flows relating to possible hedge transactions.
12.

The number of CCPs operating in the U.K. is increasing. There are four at present, with

one more expected to begin operations in 2011–12:

exchanges and platforms, as well as a range of over-the-counter (OTC) markets, including
derivatives through SwapClear (for interest rate swaps) and RepoClear (for cash bond and
repo trades).


EuroCCP, a subsidiary of the U.S. DTCC, was set up in August 2008 to clear equities from
issuers in 19 markets traded on multilateral trading facilities and stock exchanges in Europe.



ICE Clear Europe, a subsidiary of the U.S. Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), began providing
clearing services for the futures markets of ICE Futures Europe and ICE’s OTC energy markets
in 2008. In July 2009 it launched separate clearing services for credit default swaps (CDS).



In addition, U.K. regulators gave approval in December 2010 to Chicago Mercantile
Exchange (CME) Group to launch clearing for the OTC derivative trades, for which operations
began in London in May 2011, through CME Clearing Europe, a subsidiary of CME.



Finally, NYSE/EURONEXT has announced a plan to provide a dedicated CCP to clear LIFFE’s
transactions by 2012.4

13.

Cross-border and cross-currency clearing is substantial, in particular for OTC

derivatives. LCH.Clearnet Limited operates in U.S. dollars, euros, and sterling and a number of other
currencies5. SwapClear currently clears more than 40 percent of global interest rate swap
transactions, with a total notional principal of US$248 trillion. RepoClear clears 250,000 traded sides
per month in the Austrian, Belgian, Dutch, German, Irish, Finnish, Portuguese, Slovakian, Slovenian,
Spanish, and U.K. markets, representing a nominal value of €11 trillion. Until now, most eurodenominated OTC credit derivatives contracts submitted to a CCP have been cleared by ICE Clear
Europe: from July 2009 through March 2011, it cleared US$4.7 trillion in iTraxx indices and
US$917 billion in single name instruments, resulting in US$633 billion of open interest.
14.

The size, growth, and cross-border nature of U.K. clearing activities means a default

would have a very large global impact. In particular, moving OTC derivatives contracts to CCPs
following the G20 commitment will substantially raise the concentration of liquidity and credit risk,

moving derivatives risks from systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs) to CCPs, which are
becoming ‘risk nodes’ in financial markets. As CCPs are clearing more complex, less liquid, and
longer-term instruments, their potential need for funding support in a tail risk situation is rising. The
failure of a major CCP would affect not only the U.K. domestic financial market, but would also have
a cross-border dimension.

III. THE ROLE OF THE U.K. IN SIFI BUSINESS MODELS

6

15.

Many global systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs) have developed

business models and corporate structures that are heavily dependent on U.K.-based entities.
Through services that these entities provide to the group, they achieve a high degree of global
balance sheet integration, particularly regarding liquidity and risk management. As a result, any
rebalancing of the global balance sheet of the SIFI along with the services it provides to clients, is
linked to the flexibility derived from a seamless interconnection between each SIFI’s operations in
the U.K. and the rest of the world.
16.

A number of factors are behind the U.K.’s integral role in global SIFI’s operations. SIFIs

will normally channel excess liquidity from Europe, and to a lesser extent other financial centers
(such as Hong Kong, Singapore, and the Middle East) to the U.K. Similarly, the centralization of risk
management of global exposures via the clustering of deep foreign exchange and flexible OTC
derivatives markets in the U.K. implies that SIFIs can justify the U.K.’s gravitational pull.
17.

Centralizing liquidity and risk management enables an integrated SIFIs to allocate

liquidity efficiently and to use effectively the risk mitigation markets across multiple
dimensions:
Access to deep and broad-risk-spectrum markets such as foreign exchange, derivatives, and



cash instruments facilitates the use of centralized liquidity to generate cost efficiencies,
which in turn generates additional liquidity. Some firms achieve this by simultaneously using
subsidiaries (to respond to client and market needs), and branch structures (mainly handling
intra-firm needs).
Moreover, the nature of the links through which a SIFI’s global integration occurs via the U.K.



along with the diversity among SIFIs (in terms of asset and regional focus) leads market and
intra-firm interactions, concentrated in the U.K.
18.

The efficiency gains arising from SIFI’s U.K. operations are substantial but difficult to

quantify. For some global SIFIs, around a third of secured funding stems from the U.K., exceeding
the U.K.’s share of global cross-border lending. This means that for SIFIs 30 percent of the market
6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 11

UNITED KINGDOM 2011 SPILLOVER REPORT—SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

clearing cost of funding their global intermediation activities (including risk exposures, the taking
and offering of leverage) is set in the U.K. market.
19.

An example of how such efficiency gains arise is through the large and diverse pool of

collateral (initially posted by clients) that global SIFIs manage through their U.K. entities.
Access to the cash-flows from such portfolios gives SIFIs flexibility in structuring synthetic
instruments or cash flows in response to client and market needs. Moreover, the iterative and shared
use of secured funding collateral (if housed in an omnibus account7) among SIFI’s broker and dealer
entities in the U.K. helps create additional market and balance-sheet liquidity.
20.

Global SIFIs’ reliance on the U.K. makes these operations important for the efficiency

and stability of global markets. This is especially true of derivatives, structured notes, international
debt, foreign exchange, and non-U.S. repo markets. The stability and efficiency of these markets are
interlinked with the stability of the SIFIs themselves, and the efficiency they derive from their U.K.
operations. Consequently, investors and borrowers that depend on SIFIs want them to remain stable
but also continue to meet customer demands in a flexible and cost-efficient manner.

IV. THE U.K.’S ROLE AS A GLOBAL LIQUIDITY
GENERATOR
21.

8

Consistent with its role as a global treasury hub, subsidiaries, and branches of

international banks operating in the U.K., play an important role in cross-border finance. From
a universe of wholesale financial instruments, this note looks at the relative importance of BIS
reporting countries in originating cross-border bank claims—as a proxy for where banks pool
liquidity and acquire cross-border assets.

7

An omnibus account groups together individual client accounts (including those of other brokers, banks,

institutional investors, and Funds). It is a unified account, which does not allow for the retention of information about
the individual accounts. Omnibus accounts are seen as an efficient way to augment inter and intra-firm operations in
different markets and countries. They also allow firms to offer clients the ability to transact via a single firm across
markets and countries.

This measure is a simple proxy, given data limitations. A more accurate measure would require a more complete

dataset including both claims and liabilities of the consolidated and locational balance sheets of domestically
chartered banks, as well as subsidiaries and branches of foreign banks for every jurisdiction. The proxy measure does
not take into account the claims of the consolidated balance sheet of a given country’s banks on their own foreign
subsidiaries, but captures any claims by the subsidiaries on the consolidated balance sheet.

But how did the U.K.’s relative share in G4 liquidity evolve? The chart also shows the

U.K.’s share in G4 GDP and in G4 liquidity (right panel). The 45 degree line gives points where GDP
and liquidity move in tandem. From 2000 to 2004, liquidity and GDP shares grew broadly in line, but
liquidity share picked up from 2004 before falling back during the crisis (blue line). However,
correcting for nominal exchange movements, the U.K.’s share in liabilities in fact grew broadly in line
with the share in GDP until the crisis. Since then the U.K. share’s in GDP has fallen more rapidly than
its share of G4 liquidity with the severity of the recession.

28.

The relatively low leverage ratios of U.K. banks in the post-Lehman period on a

consolidated basis could suggest a limited financial accelerator role by the U.K. in the future.
Specifically, recent data released by the Bank of England (see Chart 4.10 of the December 2010 FSR
reported below) indicate that major U.K. banks have comparable, if not lower, leverage ratios to
those of LCFIs in the U.S. and other European countries. Moreover, domestic ranges appear
narrower in the pre-crisis period and the deleveraging process less abrupt than in other countries,
notably the U.S., given the lower starting base (Northern Rock is not included in the sample).

deleveraging in the past years (see Figure).12 Leverage averaged 50 for subsidiaries of foreign banks
before the collapse of Lehman, against about 27 for U.K.-owned banks. Moreover, in 2008–09,
foreign-owned banks adjusted their leverage ratios more quickly, showing higher procyclicality in
the downturn than domestic banks. Yet, this was not enough to close the difference in leverage
(which still amount to about 10 times equity).13 Among the foreign groups in the sample, Japanese,
Swiss, and Spanish subsidiaries exhibit on average the highest degrees of leverage compared with
domestic banks.
30.

U.K.-based subsidiaries also exhibit higher leverage than their parents, as the result of

balance sheet management strategies at group level and the U.K.’s role as provider of
financial services. The U.K. is a global center for secured and unsecured funding, making available
to its customers a wide range of financial products, particularly for the European market, including
derivatives and other innovative instruments. Banking groups tend to rely on their U.K.-based
activities to lower costs and maximize efficiency gains in their balance sheets.14 As a result, U.K.
subsidiaries of most foreign banks tend to have higher leverage ratios than their group on a
consolidated basis, with the only exception of Germany (i.e., Deutsche Bank) in our sample (see chart
below). These results support a global role for the U.K. system to act as a liquidity provider and
conduit for financial acceleration.

12

Throughout the analysis, leverage is defined as (Total assets) over (Total shareholders’ equity). Total capital rather

than Tier I capital is used given lack of uniform and complete data on the latter. Banks’ coverage varies across charts
due to different data availability for on- and off-balance sheet definitions, as specified in the relevant footnotes to
the figures.
13

Recently released figures for 2010 for some of the banks in sample confirm these results.

VI. A VAR ANALYSIS OF REAL AND FINANCIAL
SPILLOVERS FROM THE U.K

15

31.

An analysis of the impulse response functions from a Structural Vector Autoregression

(SVAR) is used to gauge the relative importance of real and financial spillovers from the U.K.
The Bui-Bayoumi (2010) methodology exploits the reduced uncertainty during the “great
moderation period” (1980–2007) to estimate the contemporaneous correlations for the SVAR.16 The
sample of countries includes the U.K., U.S., Euro Area, and Japan, as well as a “rest-of-the-world”
group including small industrial countries and representative emerging markets to control for
contemporaneous global developments. Results vary depending on the selected estimation period:


During the great moderation period, growth shocks from the U.K. appear to be
concentrated on the euro area, with a contained impact on other countries. The
accumulated impulse response functions (IRFs Figure 5) show a long-lasting impact on the
euro area—with a one standard deviation increase in U.K. real GDP (of about 0.5 percent of
GDP) raising output in the euro area by almost 0.2 percent at the end of a two-year horizon.
However, shocks to other major countries tend to be small and short-lived.

During period of financial stress growth shocks from the U.K. tend to generate more



wide-spread and longer-lasting spillovers through financial channels. The inclusion of
the 2008–10 crisis in the estimation period amplifies the role of the U.K., with a 0.6 percent
shock to U.K. real GDP leading to long-lasting growth spillovers to all major countries (of
about 0.4 percent of GDP).17 A decomposition of the shocks between trade, commodities,
and financial channels shows that the bulk of the growth spillovers from the U.K. during this
period stem from the financial sector. Nevertheless, the size of the shocks is also subject to
higher uncertainty during stress periods, as exemplified by wider confidence bands for the
contemporaneous correlation matrix, especially for Europe and Japan.
The bond market is identified as an important channel of financial spillovers,



consistently with the large share of international bond trading that takes place in the
U.K. SVAR results for 10-year government bond yields—applying the traditional Rigobon
identification method over 2000–2009 at weekly frequency—point to a significant role of the
U.K., with sizable and long-lasting shocks: more than 50 percent of the initial yield shock in
the U.K. spills over to euro area yields, and to a smaller extent to the U.S. and Japan. These
results are consistent with the U.K.’s importance as a global bond trading center, accounting
for an estimated 70 percent of global secondary trading in international bonds (especially
for euro-denominated securities). Similar results for the equity market, while significant,
point to smaller and shorter-lived shocks.

VII. NON-FINANCIAL SECTOR SPILLOVERS

18

32.

Spillovers from the U.K. economy stemming from outside the financial sector are

heavily weighted toward smaller non-systemic economies. Spillovers through trade and
remittances are likely to be small given that the U.K. (even if the world’s fifth largest economy)
accounts for only 4 percent of global output, 3½ percent of global trade, and 2½ percent of global

17

Outward spillovers from the U.S. dominate the “great moderation” period, while they are comparable in size to

spillovers from the U.K. once the global crisis time window is included, despite the different relative size of the two
economies due to the amplified financial channel in the latter.

remittances flows. However, the U.K. economy can have a more sizable bilateral effect on a handful
of countries—mainly former British colonies—that remain reliant on U.K. export markets, or
countries in Sub-Saharan Africa for whom it is the largest source of remittances.
33.

Growth spillovers to the other S5 economies are moderate and concentrated on the

euro-area in normal times, with longer-lasting effects only during periods of stress. A onestandard deviation shock to U.K. output affects Euro-Area output by 0.2 percent over a two-year
horizon; shocks to the U.S. and Japan are even smaller. However, the shocks intensified during the
global crisis, operating through financial channels to all major countries. Financial shocks from the
U.K. stem from both equity and bond markets, although the latter dominates, reflecting the large
share of international bond trading in the U.K. (See Note VI).
34.

The spillovers from the U.K. to other G20 economies also appear moderate. A structural

macroeconometric model19 involving international trade and financial linkages is used to derive the
impulse responses to a range of shocks in the U.K (supply, demand, monetary policy, term premium,
and equity risk premium). The peak
impulse responses of output, based

Average Peak Impulse Response (Relative to United Kingdom)

on an average of these shocks, tend
to increase with geographical
proximity to the U.K., and are larger
for financial shocks than for real
shocks. The highest dependence is
exhibited by Germany and France,
reflecting their strong trade and
financial linkages, although there is
also some impact on South Africa (see

figure).
35.

Spillovers could be much greater to a disparate group of mainly small economies that

are heavily dependent on trade with the U.K, but for which model results are unavailable
(Figure 6). Examples (with the share of their exports targeted at the U.K.) include the following:

VIII. SPILLOVERS FROM A SOVEREIGN DEBT SHOCK

This note presents simulation results for sovereign debt stress scenarios originating in

the U.K. and featuring alternative degrees of financial market contagion. These simulation
results are generated with a refined version of the structural macroeconometric model of the G20

documented in Vitek (2010) (see Figures 7, 8, and 9).21 A similar exercise was performed in the other
spillover reports on advanced economies. It does not reflect a judgment of likelihood of any of the
scenarios examined.
37.

The first scenario assumes an episode of sovereign debt stress contained within the

U.K. A sudden loss of confidence in fiscal sustainability in the U.K. is represented by a positive term
premium shock, which in isolation would raise long-term nominal interest rates in the U.K. by
450 basis points on impact. Heightened risk aversion also afflicts its stock market, represented by a
positive equity risk premium shock, which in isolation would reduce U.K. equity prices by 60 percent
on impact. Finally, loss of confidence by households and firms causes them to postpone
consumption and investment expenditures, decreasing domestic demand by 1 percent, while a fiscal
consolidation by the government reduces it by a further 2 percent. This contained episode is
estimated to generate weighted average peak output losses of 3.6 percent in the U.K., of 0.1 percent
in other advanced economies, and of 0.1 percent in emerging economies.
38.

Under the second scenario, heightened risk aversion in the U.K. spreads to bond and

stock markets worldwide. This scenario augments our first scenario with term premium shocks,
which raise long-term nominal interest rates in all other advanced economies by 30 basis points,
and all emerging economies by 45 basis points. In addition, equity risk premium shocks reduce
equity prices in all other advanced economies by 5 percent, and all emerging economies by
7½ percent. Finally, loss of confidence decreases domestic demand in all other economies by
0.2 percent, while fiscal consolidation reactions reduce it by a further 0.2 percent in other
advanced economies. This contagious sovereign debt shock is estimated to generate weighted
average peak output losses of 3.8 percent in the U.K., of 0.7 percent in other advanced economies,
and of 0.6 percent in emerging economies.
39.

The third scenario combines bond and stock market collapses worldwide with a run on

sterling. It augments the second scenario with an exchange rate risk premium shock, which in
isolation would depreciate the pound by 30 percent in nominal effective terms on impact. The
implied real effective appreciation pressure on other currencies is disinflationary, raising the scope
for monetary policy loosening to mitigate output losses in affected economies. This contagious
21

approach, International Monetary Fund Working Paper, 152. The calibration of the impact of the sovereign debt
shock on U.K. and other markets is based on empirical studies for the United States, scaled by the relative size of the
relevant financial markets.

24

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED KINGDOM 2011 SPILLOVER REPORT—SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

sovereign debt shock is estimated to generate weighted average peak output losses of 3.3 percent
in the U.K., of 0.7 percent in other advanced economies, and of 0.6 percent in emerging economies.
40.

In all the scenarios, the model probably underestimates the overall fallout from

sovereign debt stress, as it does not take into account the impact on bank balance sheets.

IX. UPSTREAM VULNERABILITY EXPOSURE TO U.K.
BANKS

22

41.

Upstream exposure is a summary measure of a borrowing country’s exposure to

rollover risk in the event of a crisis in its creditor countries. It captures the risks from both direct
cross-border lending from banks in upstream creditor countries, as well as lending by foreign
affiliates funded by creditor countries’ parent banks. It does so by combining consolidated banking
statistics (compiled by the BIS) with bank-level data.
42.

A borrowing country j’s upstream exposure is defined as:

Upstream Exposure j  Cross border claims ij  Local claims ij * (1  Min (deposit loan _ ratio ij ,1)
where: Crossborde r claims ij captures the BIS level of direct cross-border claims from country i on
country j; Local claims ij the BIS level of affiliates’ claims of parent banks from country i on country
j; and 1  Min ( deposit loan _ ratio ij ,1) proxies the proportion of loans that are not financed by
local consumer deposits.
43.

The higher the deposit to loan ratio, the lower is the share of local claims financed by

parent bank resources (or wholesale financing, which is implicitly assumed to be correlated
with the parent bank problems). If affiliates’ bank level data are unavailable, the borrowing
country’s national deposit-to-loan ratio is used to widen the sample. Using affiliates’ total assets
minus local deposits as a proxy for how much lending by affiliates is funded by their parent banks
produces similar results—especially among developing countries—but would severely limit country
coverage (e.g. individual bank-level data on branches is not reported in many countries).
44.

Financial centers (e.g. Hong Kong, Luxemburg, and Cyprus) and some other EU

countries (e.g. Ireland, Netherlands, and Belgium) were the most exposed countries (relative
to GDP) to a shock in the U.K. domestic banking system as of September 2010 (see Figure 10).
22

A similar picture emerges (see Figure 11) if exposure is expressed instead relative to host country
banking assets, although this approach also highlights higher exposures in some developing
economies.

X. ASSESSMENT OF SPILLOVERS FROM THE U.K.
BASED ON CONDITIONAL DISTRESS PROBABILITIES

23

45.

This note uses market spreads to analyze the spillovers from financial distress in U.K.

banks. The results are presented in a heat-map showing the sensitivity of banks in other countries
(both developed and emerging markets) to developments in the U.K. The sample consists of banks
from the following countries: France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Brazil, China, Hungary,
India, Japan, Korea, Russia, Turkey, and the U.S. One major bank from each country (apart from the
U.K.) is used.
46.

Spillovers are measured by averages of estimated Conditional Probabilities of Distress

(CoPoD) in banks given distress in five U.K. banks24. The CoPoDs are estimated using linear and
non-linear dependence between CDS spreads25. Averages of CoPoDs from January 2010 to early
2011 are used, which covers a period of market turmoil for many European sovereigns and banks
(particularly in the Euro-Area). Distress is defined as a (hypothetical) credit event that triggers CDS
contracts26. For example, if the CoPoD in Bank A given distress in Bank B is 0.5, CDS market prices
indicate that there is a 50 percent probability of a (hypothetical) credit event in Bank B being
followed by a credit event in Bank A. CoPoDs therefore represent the market’s assessment of
potential spillovers through channels such as direct exposure to governments and banks,
deleveraging or market confidence. CoPods do not convey any information on the direction of
contagion or causation of distress.

23

Prepared by Gavin Gray, Siret Dinc, Mohamed Norat, and Malika Pant.

24

The U.K. banks included in the model comprise Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds, RBS, and Standard Chartered.

25

The CoPoDs are estimated as in Segoviano (2006), “Consistent Information Multivariate Density Optimizing

Methodology,” Financial Markets Group, London School of Economics, Discussion Paper 557, Segoviano (2006), “The
Conditional Probability of Default Methodology,” Financial Markets Group, London School of Economics, Discussion
Paper 557, and Segoviano and Goodhart (2009), “Banking Stability Measures,” IMF Working Paper, WP/09/04.
26

A credit event could be a default or a restructuring in which bondholders are forced to bear losses. The mapping

from CDS spreads to probabilities of distress assumes a fixed recovery rate of 40 percent given distress.

Bank-to-Bank Spillovers
47.

The estimated spillovers from U.K. banks are large, but concentrated on Europe (see

Figure 12). The largest distress spillovers would fall on banks in the Euro-Area, Hungary, and
Turkey. Spillovers to Latin American, Asian, and the U.S. banking systems are smaller but still sizable.
The most internationally oriented U.K. banks (HSBC, Standard Chartered, and Barclays) have the
strongest impact on other banks, while the impact from more domestically oriented institutions (RBS
and Lloyds) is understandably more muted.

XI. CONTRIBUTION OF THE U.K. TO “COMMON RISK”
IN GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS

27

48.

This note develops a methodology for assessing the impact of U.K. financial markets

on global risk perceptions, and concludes that its impact is significant. As the world has
become globalized, financial assets have become increasingly correlated and influenced by
27

Prepared by Silvia Sgherri (SPR).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 31

UNITED KINGDOM 2011 SPILLOVER REPORT—SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

unobservable global “common factors”, also known as “risk commonalities”. Overall, the U.K. is
estimated to contribute up to 20 percent of changes in risk commonalities, a similar effect to that of
the Euro Area albeit smaller than that of the U.S. While the U.K. interbank and stock market have
significant effects, corporate bond spreads appear less significant.
49.

The methodology relies on principal component analysis, which is used to estimate the

extent to which unobservable shifts in common risk factors contribute to observed changes in
asset-specific expected returns. As international investors react to shocks by rebalancing their
portfolios in asset markets that would otherwise be unrelated, any change in investors’ willingness
to bear risk—or any common shock—is deemed to raise the co-movement across asset returns. By
assuming that risk premiums embedded in selected asset yield differentials are determined jointly in
the market and influenced by both asset-specific factors and a common factor, the latter component
can be identified and stripped out. In other words, if there is an increase in the (risk-neutral)
probability of default for all assets considered—which is likely to have happened during the global
financial crisis—this would likely be picked up in the principal component, along with shifts in
investors’ attitude toward risk.
50.

The contribution of U.K. asset markets to the estimated common risk component is

gauged by adding up the contribution to the common risk component of all asset markets in the
region. The analysis also permits an assessment of the extent of volatility spillovers from individual
U.K. asset markets across borders and across markets, once we abstract from “risk commonalities”.
51.

The analysis relies on the set of risk premiums embedded in the following yield

differentials:


U.S. asset-backed commercial paper (versus the 3-month U.S. Treasury bond yield);



3-month U.S. dollar, euro, sterling, and yen London interbank offered rates (versus their
corresponding overnight index swap rates);



U.S., euro-area, U.K., and Japanese high-yield financial and industrial corporate bonds
(versus their respective benchmark 10-year government bond yields);



U.S., euro-area, U.K., and Japanese equities (whose implied risk is computed as the earnings
price ratio versus their respective benchmark 10-year government bond yields);



10-year sovereign bonds (over Bunds) for peripheral euro-area countries (including Greece,
Ireland, Portugal, and Spain);



Asia, Europe, and Latam emerging markets bonds (whose implied risk is given by their
global EMBI+ spread versus the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond yield).

32

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED KINGDOM 2011 SPILLOVER REPORT—SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

52.

The estimated unobserved factor indicates that the common risk component ratcheted

up sharply during Spring 2010 (see Figure 13) as sovereign pressures in peripheral European
countries intensified. But the rise in risk commonalities was not as severe as it had been during the
Lehman bankruptcy. 28

The analysis suggests that U.K. financial markets have played a non-negligible role in

transmitting financial shocks to the rest of the world. In particular, the U.K. is estimated to
contribute to one-fifth of the changes in risk commonalities—which is smaller than the contribution
from the U.S., but broadly in line with the one of the Euro Area and the emerging markets.

28

The importance of risk commonalities varies over time, being greater at time of generalized stress in financial

markets. On average, over the sample August 2007–February 2011, risk commonalities are found to explain about
one-third of the total volatility for the portfolio considered.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 33

UNITED KINGDOM 2011 SPILLOVER REPORT—SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

54.

The U.K. interbank and stock market seem to be characterized by significant volatility

spillovers vis-à-vis corresponding asset markets in the U.S. and—to a lesser extent—the Euro
Area. Specifically, while “raw” cross-market correlations (blue bars in the charts below) indicate that
“observed” volatility co-movements across assets and borders tend to be widespread, an
examination of cross-correlations of spreads where the common risk component has been stripped
out (red bars) reveals that specific volatility to the U.K. interbank and equity markets is more likely to
spread across corresponding markets in the U.S. and the Euro Area than across different markets
(with the exception, perhaps, of spillovers between the interbank markets and the U.S. asset-backed
commercial paper, see Figures 14 and 15). This seems also to confirm the existence of effective
hedging positions in EMBI+ bond markets vis-à-vis stock market risk in the U.K., the U.S., and the
Euro Area.

By contrast, volatility spillovers from the U.K. financial corporate bond market to the

rest of the world appear limited (see Figure 16). Once the common risk component is stripped
out, specific volatility spillovers from the U.K. financial corporate bond market are likely to be felt
only in the bond market of U.K. non-financial corporations, signaling only an interrelation in the
perceived riskiness of the two domestic bond markets.

with sharp reactions in the value of traded equity instruments of global systemically important
banks. Moreover, while commonly used proxies for funding pressures did not immediately react, the
price of hedging cross currency exposures—another indication of market funding pressures—rose
sharply.
57.

Markets reacted to U.K. announcements on liquidity regulation by punishing SIFIs with

universal and investment banking business models. The average price to book value of SIFIs
with a universal and investment banking business model relative to their home country index fell
sharply on key dates coinciding with U.K. announcements on liquidity. On the other hand, the
reaction of equity prices of commercial banks was not as pronounced. An interpretation of this is
that markets viewed changes in U.K. policy on liquidity as having a materially negative impact on the
business models of those banks with business models that rely significantly on the U.K. to efficiently
pool and allocate liquidity on a global scale (see Figure 17.).
58.

Some indicators of U.S. dollar funding pressures exhibited sharp reactions to U.K.

announcements. While LIBOR-OIS, a common proxy indicator of liquidity risk, did not immediately
react to announcements on changes in U.K. regulation on liquidity standards, the cost of employing
the so-called butterfly strategy to hedge against sharp movements in the exchange rate moved
sharply (see Figure 18.). This is indicative of a rise in market’s fear that sharp movements in
exchange rates will directly impact their ability to continue accessing cross currency based funding
sources (see text Box).

Box 1: Alternative Measures of Cross-Currency Funding Risk
In the absence of market distress or excess uncertainty, the price of borrowing U.S. dollars in
the short-term funding markets can be gauged by observing USD Libor fixings. However,
anecdotal evidence suggests that in the wake of the crisis, Libor fixings have become less indicative
of the actual price of borrowing. As a result, commonly used indicators of liquidity risk such as the
spread between Libor and OIS may not be as informative as they once were. By implication, it
becomes a necessity to uncover alternative ways of gauging liquidity risk.
A simple deconstruction of the Libor-OIS relationship (why the spread indicates funding
pressure) implies that the relationship between domestic rates and Libor should remain close
to parity (~ 10 basis points). By extension this parity can be translated into a relationship
between the pricing of short-term funding and interest-rate parity between currency pairs. As such,
an alternative to an outright short term borrowing contract underpinned by a Libor fixing, can be a
currency swap agreement with an implicitly priced “borrowing rate” premium to account for
valuation changes along with other embedded risks. For example a U.S. dollar—Euro currency swap
will normally mean that the swap payer (i.e. the party receiving liquidity upfront in exchange for
periodic payments of rate changes over time) is long U.S. dollar cash and short EUR/USD exchange
rate risk.
Normally, this type of transaction is a hedging vehicle; however, when a currency swap is
used as a funding vehicle it requires a hedging instrument of its own. FX options can easily fill
this role. One particular option based strategy allows a discounted if not costless hedging of FX risk
embedded in the currency swap, namely an FX butterfly. The butterfly allows the party exposed to
exchange rate risk to mitigate large movements in a given currency pair.

percent for advanced economies (reflecting their dependence on credit provided by U.K.-based
banks), and 0.04 to 0.05 percent for emerging markets (see Figure 19). While the U.K. has strong
financial links to the U.S., Germany, and France, the impact on the latter two economies is larger,
suggesting that their more bank-based financial systems will suffer a greater impact from regulatory
reform.

The simulations in this note are derived from an extended version of a macro-

econometric model of the world economy, disaggregated into its 15 largest economies (Vitek,
2009). These scenarios abstract from monetary policy and assume that effects of the increase in
capital requirements are transmitted exclusively via a permanent increase in the spread between
commercial bank lending and deposit rates (calibrated at a 0.12 percent increase in the interest rate
spread per 1 percent increase in capital requirement31). The negative impact on the U.K. economy
spills over to other economies via trade and exchange rate linkages. To capture cross-border bank

lending channels, increases in lending spreads are imposed on the other economies proportionally
to the share of credit provided by U.K.-incorporated banks.
61.

A binding one percent increase in capital adequacy requirements (or equivalent rise in

lending spreads) in the U.K. is estimated to generate a peak output loss of 0.19 to
0.24 percent in the U.K., depending on the speed of implementation. In other advanced
economies, the estimated weighted average peak output loss ranges between 0.04 and
0.06 percent, reflecting their dependence on credit provided by U.K. incorporated banks (see
Figure 20). In emerging economies, this peak output loss ranges between 0.04 and 0.05 percent,
reflecting their trade openness and managed exchange rate regimes.

While the effects are modest, simulations for other economies in the model also yield

small impacts. The U.K. impact is, in fact, disproportionately large considering its relative size in
GDP or trade flows: while U.K. GDP is about a sixth of U.S. GDP, the impact of a capital increase on
other economies in the sample is over 60 percent of the U.S. impact for other advanced economies
and over 70 percent for emerging markets (see figure below). For comparison, and while somewhat
understated by exclusion of the bank lending channel from the model for this simulation, the Euro
area has a smaller effect (it lies to the right of the diagonal). Using trade flows rather than GDP as a
benchmark yields a similar conclusion with respect to the U.K.

These results are subject to a number of caveats. Firstly, the model does not allow for

changes in bank behavior, that may cause them to retrench further in activities or countries
perceived as “noncore” to save capital. It also does not capture the effects of competition in
moderating the impact of a capital increase on lending spreads (though this concern may be
lessened by the fact that banks in many countries will be applying the new rules in parallel), or that
market conditions for bank capital and funding will change over time and have a (possibly much
larger) impact on lending spreads. If higher capital were to induce investors to accept lower returns
on equity, lending spreads would not have to rise as much (see Admati et al, 2011, although market
interlocutors were skeptical this mechanism would operate).32 The model operates through standard
macroeconomic relationships, and thus does not model bank behavior or balance sheets, or capture
other aspects of the transmission of financial shocks.
64.

As noted elsewhere, macroeconomic channels may be relatively unimportant in the

case of the U.K. For example, while raising lending spreads is one channel through which banks
may react to increased capital requirements, they may also more directly restrict the quantity of new
lending, which could have an even larger effect on credit supply and economic activity. Using a
bank-by-bank approach, Francis and Osborne (2009) find that a 1 percent increase in capital
requirements in 2002 would have reduced lending (total risk-weighted assets) by 1.2 (2.4) percent

after four years, although they do not estimate the impact on economic activity.33 Finally, possible
effects on long-run aggregate supply are not captured by the model. These may be small, implying
that modest short-run impact could be counteracted by easier monetary policy, and that costs will
be outweighed by benefits in terms of increased financial stability.34
