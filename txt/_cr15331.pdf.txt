IMF Executive Board Concludes Article IV Consultation with Cameroon

On November 18, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Cameroon1.
The economy has shown resilience in the face of the twin shocks of the oil price slump and
heightened security threats, with the robust growth of 2014 continuing into 2015. Growth is
broad-based and projected to reach 5.9 percent in 2015, buoyed by increased oil production and
the performance of sectors benefiting from the ongoing public investment boom. Annual
inflation is projected at 2.8 percent and has not been significantly affected by the 15 percent
increase in administered fuel prices on July 1, 2014. Total revenue is projected to increase
in 2015, owing to a strong performance in non-oil revenue. However, the fiscal deficit is
expected to widen to 5.4 percent of GDP, as revenue mobilization efforts are hampered by the oil
price decrease and capital expenditure increases further. The reliance on foreign financing for
investment expenditure, including on non-concessional terms, has resulted in a sharp rise (from a
low base) in external public debt, which represented 17.8 percent of GDP at end-2014. The
current account deficit, meanwhile, is projected to increase to 5.1 percent of GDP, reflecting
lower prices for exports and continued strong imports, driven by the growth in investment.
Growth is projected to moderate to 5.2 percent in 2016, as oil production stabilizes. Inflation is
projected to remain low, at 2.2 percent, in line with moderate prices trends for key commodity
imports and low euro area inflation. The fiscal deficit is projected to rise to 7.2 percent of GDP,
reflecting continued strong public investment and increased expenditures to counter security
threats. The external current account deficit is projected to rise to 5.3 percent of GDP, as
continued strong imports and the terms-of-trade shock of 2015 continue to have an impact. The
financial sector remains relatively sound and has excess liquidity, although this has declined
since the onset of the oil price shock and the investment boom. At the same time, nonperforming loans in the banking sector increased from 10.2 percent in June 2014 to 13.1 percent
a year later, with micro-finance institutions showing similar trends. Bank supervision at national

and regional levels has improved. The regional supervisor (COBAC) remains vigilant to
potential stresses to the financial system arising from protracted low oil prices and possible
regional spillovers.
The medium-term outlook has somewhat deteriorated since the last Article IV consultation,
reflecting weaker prospects for oil and other exports, in addition to the security threats. Lower oil
revenues and the costs of countering the security threats are expected to reduce fiscal space
going forward. Against this background, the overall fiscal deficit is projected to remain above
5 percent of GDP until 2018, after which the public investment program returns to more normal
levels and the fiscal balance is projected to improve. The external current account deficit is
projected to rise to 5.3 percent of GDP, as continued strong imports and the terms-of-trade shock
of 2015 continue to have an impact.
Downside risks to the outlook are primarily on the external side, including a deepening of the oil
price slump and an extension of security threats. At the same time, domestic risks, such as
contingent liabilities from state-owned enterprises, could have an adverse impact on public
finances.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed the notable resilience and continued robust growth of
Cameroon’s economy so far in the face of sharply falling international oil prices and heightened
regional security threats. While acknowledging the need to bridge infrastructure gaps, Directors
nevertheless noted that fiscal and external vulnerabilities are rising on the back of the decline in
oil revenue and an ambitious public investment program. Directors stressed that sound fiscal and
debt management policies and more ambitious structural reforms are critical to preserve
macroeconomic stability, boost private sector investment, and promote stronger, sustainable, and
inclusive growth.
Directors stressed the importance of improving fiscal discipline. They encouraged the authorities
to adopt a prudent budget based on a realistic oil price assumption, and to develop a credible
medium-term consolidation strategy going forward. They welcomed recent tax revenue
mobilization efforts and recommended stronger efforts to enhance customs revenue collection.
Directors underscored the need for similar efforts on the expenditure side by strengthening
public financial management. They called for action to eliminate arrears and improve oversight
of contingent liabilities from state-owned enterprises.
Directors emphasized the importance of rationalizing the parallel public investment programs
and to bring them fully into the budget. They also encouraged the authorities to take advantage

of the current low oil prices to eliminate fuel subsidies while developing a social safety net to
protect the poor. Adopting a medium-term fiscal anchor would help mitigate the impact of oilprice volatility and exert better control over public spending.
Directors emphasized the importance of preserving debt sustainability. They encouraged the
authorities to pursue a prudent debt management strategy giving more priority to concessional
borrowing and financing through regional markets. They called for a careful assessment and
prioritization of investment projects on the basis of their potential impact on growth and poverty
reduction and taking into account administrative and implementation capacity.
Directors noted that the financial sector is relatively stable. They encouraged continued close
collaboration with the regional oversight body to enhance financial sector surveillance, including
of micro-financial institutions and the new bank for small and medium-size enterprises. Directors
called for vigilance with regard to rising nonperforming loans.
Directors emphasized that ambitious structural reforms aimed at boosting private sector activity
and economic diversification by creating a business-friendly environment, and easier access to
credit, are needed to lift growth in a sustainable and inclusive manner. They encouraged the
authorities to reinvigorate their efforts to promote regional integration. Directors also called for
further progress in improving the quality and timeliness of data and statistics.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
November 2, 2015

KEY ISSUES
Context. Cameroon’s macroeconomic and security environments have deteriorated since
the last consultation. In 2014–15, the economy has shown resilience in the face of the twin
shocks of the oil price slump and heightened security threats, with still robust growth and
low inflation. However, fiscal performance has weakened and the government continued to
accumulate domestic arrears, as expenditure pressures have shifted from fuel subsidies to
security expenditure. Cameroon’s economic outlook has worsened and proximate risks
have become more dominant. As a result of projected financing gaps and a surge in public
infrastructure investment, public debt is expected to increase rapidly. Growth is projected
to stabilize at about 5 percent in the medium-term, a rate lower than what would be
needed to achieve emerging market status by 2035.
Focus of the consultation and risks. The overarching policy issue is how to weather the
twin shocks and maintain sustainable high growth. The main exogenous risks are a
protracted slump in the global economy and the spreading of regional security problems.
Endogenous risks stem from an expansionary, debt-fueled public investment program,
large contingent liabilities from state-owned enterprises, and increasing non-concessional
debt.
Key policy recommendations:


Rationalize and scale back parallel public investment programs to cut the budget
deficit.



Adopt a path for the non-oil primary deficit to rebuild fiscal space, preserve mediumterm fiscal stability, and support external adjustment.



Eliminate the fuel-subsidy scheme to avoid possible future fuel subsidies.



Improve expenditure control by strengthening public financial management and the
oversight of contingent liabilities from state-owned enterprises.



Promote higher and inclusive growth through a better business climate and measures
to target vulnerable groups.



Strengthen the supervision of the financial sector, especially that of the rapidly
expanding micro-finance sector.

WEATHERING SHOCKS IN THE FACE OF UNCERTAINTIES
The international and regional contexts have dramatically changed since the mid-2014 consultation. So
far, Cameroon has weathered the twin shocks of the oil price slump and security threats, but pressure is
building. Continued robust growth in 2014–15 reflected strong domestic demand driven by accelerated
public investment. This, in turn, has increased the fiscal deficits and the debt burden. Social indicators
continue to lag the authorities’ aim to become an emerging economy in the next 20 years.
1.
Cameroon suffered two major shocks in 2014. First the international crude oil price slump has
reduced government revenue and exports, although the shock was significantly smaller than for other
Economic and Monetary Community of Central Africa (CEMAC) countries. Second, the surge of terrorist
attacks in the Lake Chad region has disrupted economic activity in Cameroon’s extreme north, which
has required large-scale, multinational military operations in response. These operations have
succeeded in reducing the number and severity of the attacks in Cameroon.

Growth in 2015 is projected at almost 6 percent, supported by a surge in oil production
and a further increase in public investment. This contrasts with the projected growth rate of about
2 percent for CEMAC. Oil extraction is expected to rise by almost 25 percent, as new wells come on
stream (Figure 3). Inflation is projected to increase to almost 3 percent, as second-round effects of the
mid-2014 fuel price increase work their way through food and transport prices. Structural
competitiveness issues, including an unpropitious business climate and lack of progress in regional
integration, will continue to hamper private sector development, leading to a medium-term growth
rate of about 5 percent.

Fiscal performance deteriorated in 2014. The fiscal deficit, on a cash basis and including
grants, widened to 4.8 percent of GDP, as the increase in revenue lagged that in expenditure
(Tables 2–3 and 6–9). This outturn would have been worse, were it not for the a 15 percent increase in
retail fuel prices in mid-2014, which helped contain subsidies, as oil prices reached more than US$110
per barrel. Efficiency improvements helped non-oil revenue increase by almost one percentage point
of GDP from 2013, thanks to strong direct taxes and customs income. Conversely, oil revenue dropped
half a percentage point of GDP from 2013, as declining royalties reflected the oil price slump in the
second half of the year. Expenditure was driven by public investment (up by 1.1 percentage points of
GDP over 2013) and current expenditure, notably fuel subsidies (2.3 percent of GDP on an accrual
basis), despite the mid-year price increase. The stock or arrears remained stable at 4.6 percent of GDP
at end-2014, reflecting an increase in arrears to fuel distributors, and a decrease in unsettled payment
obligations.

5.
The medium-term fiscal outlook is threatened by the deteriorating global and regional
environments and expanding public investment. Lower oil prices are expected to reduce fuel
subsidies by 1.2 percentage points of GDP in 2015, but also to cut a comparable amount from oil
revenue. Security operations in the extreme north are expected to drive public expenditure up in 2015
and beyond. New infrastructure projects to accelerate development and revitalize the extreme north
are projected to push capital spending to 10 percent of GDP in 2016. As a result, the fiscal deficit is
projected to peak at over 7 percent of GDP in 2016. The non-oil primary deficit (NOPD) is projected to
follow a similar trend as a percentage of non-oil GDP. Reflecting, inter alia, these fiscal developments,
the government’s net worth is projected to decline in the medium term (Box 1).
6.
Poverty remains high according to the preliminary results of the 2014 household survey.
Although poverty fell by two percentage points between 2007 and 2014 to 37.5 percent of the
population, its level is comparable to that of a low-income country (Text Table 2 and Table 14).3 Its

remained constrained by high fuel subsidies, in spite of the gasoline price increase. Although the oil

security threats in the extreme north have entailed rising expenditure, thus limiting allocations to the
social sectors.

Box 1. Cameroon: Government Balance Sheet
Increasing liabilities and stagnating assets are projected to reduce the government’s net worth by
31 percent in nominal terms between 2013 and 2020. The Box Table shows that despite the projected
steady increase in public capital stock,1 as a result of sustained public investment, total government assets
will stagnate in nominal terms because of a 38 percent decline in the value of oil reserves between 2013
and 2020. This significant fall is due to the depletion of oil reserves (from 230 million barrels in 2015) and
low oil price projections. The overall stability of assets is more than offset by a threefold increase in liabilities,
reflecting the increase in public debt to finance public investment. The large increase in debt is the result,
inter alia, of the higher cost of non-concessional borrowing. It may also be related to low factor productivity
(Box 2).

Cameroon’s public capital stock has been calculated using the permanent inventory method of growth
accounting exercises. Based on the literature on public capital stock (e.g., Kamps, 2004; Arestoff and Hurlin, 2006;
Alrlanalp, Bohorts and Gupta 2011), Cameroon’s estimates appear to be relatively conservative.

7.
With current large borrowing plans and lower oil exports, Cameroon’s risk of external debt
distress has risen from “low” to “high” in the space of less than three years. Public debt is
projected to reach more than 42 percent of GDP by 2020, more than twice its level at end-2013, while
debt service is also expected to double in the medium term. The rapid increase in external debt, the
mostly non-concessional terms of new loans, and the fall in the value of Cameroon’s main exports are
the main factors, which explain the breach of the threshold for the ratio of the present value of external
debt to exports in 2021 (Figure 4 and companion debt sustainability analysis). The breach is
significant—the ratio nears 130 versus a threshold of 100—and is projected to last over the long term.

8.
Cameroon’s nominal and real effective exchange rates (REERs) appreciated between 2012
and 2014. This trend reversed the depreciation experienced in the wake of the global recession
of 2008–09, but represents a continuation of the long-term appreciation witnessed since 1994
(Annex II). Nonetheless, model-based assessments find that the REER is not significantly misaligned
with current account norms. These findings are consistent with the CEMAC regional consultation of
mid-2015, which also concluded that there was no significant misalignment for the regional REER.
9.
Medium-term macroeconomic stability is threatened by growing risks (Annex III).
Cameroon’s outlook is adversely affected by growing external risks: (i) a protracted global commodity
price slump; and (ii) terrorist attacks in the extreme north increasing and overflowing into the rest of
the country. Domestic risks include: (i) contingent liabilities arising from state-owned enterprises (SOEs;
companion selected issues paper—SIP); (ii) a return of fuel subsidies under an unreformed fuel-subsidy
scheme, should international oil prices rise (SIP); and (iii) excessive credit exposure of the national
refinery (SONARA) jeopardizing the banking system and the real sector. The authorities have been
actively seeking international financial and operational support to counter the security threats.
10.
Data provision to the IMF is broadly adequate for surveillance, but important gaps
remain in fiscal and external sectors information. Government fiscal operations, on a commitment
basis, are not available and the timeliness of debt figures should be improved. The quality and
timeliness of balance of payments statistics have improved, but further work is needed to move toward
the 6th Edition of the Balance of Payments Manual.

POLICY DISCUSSION—SPURRING PRIVATE SECTOR-LED
GROWTH
Cameroon’s challenge is to adapt its economy and budget to confront its twin shocks, while switching to
a growth model less reliant on public investment financed by non-concessional debt. Sustaining inclusive
growth also requires a timely implementation of structural reforms to promote private sector activity and
stronger policies designed to address inequality.

A. Fostering Private Sector-Led Growth
11.
The private sector has the potential to overtake the public sector as the engine of
growth. There is strong potential beyond government in key sectors underpinning the economy, such
as energy and construction. The capacity of cement production has more than doubled since the last
consultation, with the arrival of new foreign investors, which is a testimony to the private sector’s
readiness to grow.
12.
Lack of structural competitiveness continues to be a critical issue. Total factor productivity
made a negative contribution to growth in Cameroon (Box 2). The government has taken initiatives to
improve the business environment. However, its initiatives have not led to a significant decrease in the
number of public interventions and discretion by public officials in the conduct of business. Cameroon’s
ranking in the World Bank’s “Doing Business” indicators have deteriorated: it ranks 158th in 2015, versus
148th in 2014. Cameroon’s performance deteriorated in five of ten indicators, stagnated in four, and
improved in one. The most ground was lost in dealing with construction permits and starting a business.
The 2013 law on investment incentives has generated almost 100 agreements, but mostly with firms
already present in Cameroon, rather than with new foreign firms.
13.
Regional integration and the promise of a single CEMAC market remain elusive. Given the
challenges faced by the CEMAC Commission in resuming work in its headquarters in Bangui, Central
African Republic, staff urged the authorities, representing the largest economy in the Community, to lead
a reinvigoration of regional integration by:


Ensuring adequate human and financial resources for the CEMAC Commission.



Pushing for a common external tariff across all product categories for the CEMAC customs union,
mindful of the bilateral Economic Partnership Agreement between the European Union and
Cameroon.



Harmonizing economic and technical standards, such as sanitary standards for perishable products.



Addressing other non tariff barriers, such as burdensome customs procedures stemming from limited
cooperation between national administrations. For example, there is no applicable agreement for
Cameroonian customs to collect import tariffs for merchandise transiting through the region’s main
sea port in Douala and redistribute the proceeds according to the country of final destination.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CAMEROON

Authorities’ views
14.
The authorities expressed confidence in the contribution of large public investment
projects to growth and economic diversification. They felt that the large infrastructure projects
throughout the country that are nearing completion would lift the rate of economic growth
sustainably. Moreover, they were confident that an additional, nation-wide, supplemental investment
program would further boost economic growth and return the country to the path towards achieving
emerging economy status by 2035.4 They concurred with staff’s recommendation to focus on firstgeneration projects nearing completion. They recognized the need to enhance the ability of the private
sector to contribute more to growth and opined that filling the infrastructure and energy gaps was the
best way to achieve this.
15.
The authorities agreed with the need to strengthen competitiveness and remove
obstacles to trade. They shared staff’s views on regional integration, as one of the great opportunities
for growth, especially given the less favorable global economic outlook. As the largest and most
diversified economy in CEMAC, they recognized that they were expected to show leadership in
regional cooperation and integration. However, they noted the generally difficult process of coming to
agreement with other CEMAC partners.

B. Rationalizing Public Expenditure to Preserve Fiscal Sustainability
16. The 2015 budget execution has been thrown into disarray by the fall in oil revenue,
unexpected security spending, and the supplemental investment program. Revenue performance
is expected to deteriorate in terms of GDP compared with 2014. This reflects the steep decline in oil
revenue, which has only been partially offset by stronger-than-expected non-oil revenue performance,
stemming from tax administration reforms and one-off sales of mobile phone licenses. Total
expenditure, in terms of GDP, will remain at the same level as in 2014; however its composition will
change significantly, with current expenditure contracting by 0.7 percentage point of GDP, on account
of lower subsidies, and capital expenditure increasing by the same amount because of expanding
public investment. The overall budget deficit is thus expected to widen to 5.4 percent of GDP. It is
expected to be financed by a mix of domestic and external borrowing and deferred payments. High
capital expenditure is also expected to increase imports of investment-related goods and push the
current account deficit above 5 percent of GDP in the medium term. The authorities are preparing to
issue a US$1.5 billion Eurobond to pay arrears to SONARA and finance the supplemental investment
program.

4

The three-year program (“plan d’urgence”) of infrastructure projects (including hospitals, secondary roads, agricultural
projects) is equivalent to some 1.7 percent of GDP annually.

Box 2. Cameroon: Total Factor Productivity and Structural Competitiveness
Total factor productivity (TFP) in Cameroon has been lagging that of peers. A growth accounting
exercise for 49 African and Asian countries from 1991 to 2012 analyzed the average contribution of capital,
labor, and TFP to growth.1 It showed that TFP made a negative contribution to growth in Cameroon.
Moreover the Box Figure shows that among five groups (WAEMU, African frontier economies, African
emerging markets, Asian benchmark peers, and sub-Saharan African countries) only Cameroon and WAEMU
had negative TFP contributions to growth. The figure also shows that Cameroon had the lowest contribution
of capital to growth (about one percent).
Cameroon’s week structural competitiveness could explain the disappointing contribution of TFP to
growth. The external sustainability assessment (Annex II) shows that Cameroon has a challenging business
environment and governance, which could explain the negative contribution of TFP. In African frontier
economies, which had made considerable progress in improving competitiveness, the contribution of TFP to
growth was significant, despite similarly low levels of contribution of labor and capital to growth.

17.
Rapid growth in non-concessional external debt has become the most important threat
to fiscal sustainability. The sharp and persistent decline in oil revenue and the rapid increase in public
debt require equally decisive and firm measures to ensure fiscal sustainability. On the expenditure side,
most investment projects in the supplemental program are at an early conceptual stage and far from
the financing stage. There are capacity constraints for properly implementing numerous, large, and
complex infrastructure projects simultaneously. There are also long delays between the coming on
stream of new infrastructure and related government revenue generation. All this calls for a
consolidation and rationalization of the authorities’ investment plans and their full incorporation into
the budget. Rather than surging ahead with additional externally financed projects, at a time of fiscal
stress, a commitment to a medium-term fiscal anchor, such as the NOPD, seems warranted, as are
measures to exert better control over capital and security expenditures.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

CAMEROON

18.
Staff encouraged the authorities to tighten the fiscal stance in the absence of additional
revenue or concessional financing. Given the limited prospects of mobilizing large amounts of
additional revenue in the short term, staff made the following recommendations:


Adopt a NOPD that that does not jeopardize fiscal sustainability, with a downward path to below
4 percent of non-oil GDP in the medium term.



Expand the tax base further by creating more decentralized tax offices to facilitate tax payments;
phase out tax and customs exemptions; eliminate the fuel-subsidy scheme; and restore normal
taxation of fuel products. Narrow eligibility under the investment incentives law to new external
investments with a clearly demonstrable impact on growth. Finalize single taxpayer identification
by interconnecting relevant databases in the tax and customs administrations.



Restore the budget to its role as an effective expenditure control mechanism by adopting a
supplemental budget for 20155 and a realistic budget for 2016 to (i) unify, rationalize, and scale
down multiple investment programs and bring them into the budget, while focusing on projects
with a high impact on growth and poverty; (ii) phase in gradually projects for which debt has been
contracted but whose implementation has not yet started; and (iii) bring the full extent of security
expenditures onto the budget.



Focus on projects nearing completion; and allocate appropriate resources for maintenance.



Call a moratorium on new infrastructure projects, in light of the more than US$4 billion contracted
but undisbursed project loans, unless the financing is concessional.



Improve the implementation of the medium-term debt strategy by vesting sole authority for
contracting debt in the Minister of Finance.



Issue regional bonds in local currency in amounts and at a pace consistent with market absorptive
capacity.



Postpone the issuance of the proposed Eurobond, which is likely to be onerous under current
market conditions, because the projects it is intended to finance are insufficiently mature.



Implement the new information technology system under consideration to reconcile the civil
service payroll with the treasury payment system. Elaborate wage bill projections to better inform
the schedule for the proposed hiring of new civil servants.



Strengthen the monitoring of the performance of SOEs, especially SONARA, with particular focus
on contingent liabilities. An annual report should be produced on the financial health of all SOEs
and state-owned banks, and efforts made to clear SONARA’s arrears, including its overdue supplier
credits.

5

This recommendation was made at the time of the consultation in September 2015 when preparations for a
supplemental budget were at an advanced stage at the technical level.

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CAMEROON

Authorities’ views
19.
The authorities were undecided on the need for a supplemental budget. They noted that
they could accommodate deviations from budget allocations without necessarily resorting to a
supplemental budget. They also noted that the supplemental investment program had been approved
by Parliament earlier in 2015, including its external financing. They also thought that by reallocating
unspent money (e.g., fuel subsidies) they could largely meet unforeseen expenditure (e.g., security
expenditure). They considered that unforeseen economic and fiscal developments in 2015 can be fully
addressed in the 2016 budget.
20.
The authorities did not agree that Cameroon had reached a high risk of debt distress.
They pointed out that (i) the value of exports could rebound with a possible rise in commodity prices;
(ii) SONARA’s large external arrears should not be counted toward the total public and publicly
guaranteed debt, because they are suppliers’ credit pending payment; and (iii) the rating of external
debt distress was the result of a breach under only one test among the five standard tests. They
nonetheless agreed that Cameroon’s fiscal sustainability had deteriorated, and thus recognized the
need to improve the cost-effectiveness of public spending. They also committed to improving non-oil
revenue mobilization, in line with the recommendations of FAD technical assistance. As in previous
years, the authorities saw limited merit in a fiscal rule anchored on the NOPD, if only because oil is
expected to fade as a contributor to GDP. They were open to considering the elimination of the fuelsubsidy scheme, but were mindful of the social impact in the event that prices rise too sharply and
considered that this reform was not a priority in times of low oil prices.

C. Improving Expenditure Management
21.
The strain on public expenditure is exacerbating dysfunctions in public financial
management (PFM). The treasury is working in practice through both the state’s single treasury
account and the national hydrocarbon company’s (SNH) “advances” account, contrary to IMF staff
advice. Increasing recourse to cash outlays by the treasury, which are not covered by appropriations in
the budget, and direct expenditures by SNH make ex post regularization in the budget increasingly
difficult, even though SNH’s payments on behalf of the government are periodically reconciled with
the budget accounts. The prospects for more rational budget execution were also undermined by the
extension of the “complementary period” for closing public accounts in 2014 by more than three
months, which allowed commitments on the 2014 budget to be made in 2015. The treasury has,
however, made notable progress in winding down undisbursed balances in subaccounts used to hold
public entities’ expended subsidies.
22.
The budget has ceased to be an instrument to guide and control the public finances. This
hinders progress toward the authorities’ efforts to implement program budgeting. The budget also
suffers from the continuing practice of registering only the net result of offsetting transactions
between the budget and public entities (e.g., subsidies canceled against taxes due). This undermines
budget analysis, transparency, and is a potential source of errors. Moreover, parts of the investment
budget financed from external sources are recorded in the budget with delays of up to two years.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

CAMEROON

23.
Staff encouraged the authorities to restore fiscal discipline by reinforcing expenditure
control through the ex ante verification of budget allocations and the availability of adequate
liquidity. Specific recommendations included:


Accounting for all revenue and expenditure flows on a gross basis.



Limiting the complementary period to one month, and starting to use “carry forwards” for
unspent budget allocations.



Compiling the backlog of pending payments (including toward SONARA) and proceeding to
clear this backlog with cash payments or formal debt obligations.



Ceasing to use SNH as an off-budget, advance expenditure mechanism.



Eliminating various tax expenditures, including by winding down the large number of preferential
agreements—this could yield annual revenues of more than one percent of GDP.



Narrowing the scope of the 2013 investment incentives law to a few strategic sectors.

Authorities’ views
24.
The authorities agreed with the need for better monitoring and more comprehensive
accounting and reporting of public spending. They noted that expenditure reallocations were
always formally approved by the Prime Minister, with a view to regularizing all spending and
communicating a full account of the use of resources to Parliament.
25.
They also agreed to consider IMF staff recommendations to improve commitment
controls and to reassert control over public expenditure. In particular, they pointed to their
implementation of a new information technology architecture that will connect the civil service register
to the payroll. However, they did not see a need to reconsider externally financed public investment
plans, as these were deemed essential for accelerated growth and were in any case fully financed.

D. Promoting Sound Financial Intermediation
26.
Despite the oil price slump and the security crisis, the banking sector appears relatively
sound (Table 13). By end-June 2015, total bank assets grew by 6.2 percent year-on-year, while deposits
and credits increased by 6.1 percent and 13.0 percent, respectively. This performance reflected strong
domestic demand, linked to investment growth. However, banks’ non-performing loans (NPLs)
increased from 10.2 percent in June 2014 to 13.1 percent a year later, as did those of micro-finance
institutions (MFIs). The somewhat improved financial situation of SONARA also lessened the banking
system’s credit risk. Excess liquidity in the banking system ebbed, but remained significant at almost
5 percent of GDP, although the situation varied across institutions. The issue of three small problem
banks remained unresolved and continues to hinder financial intermediation. The new governmentsponsored bank for small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) started operations in July 2015 with two
agencies (in Yaoundé and Douala), but has yet to extend significant amounts of credit.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CAMEROON

27.
After a long period of gestation, mobile transfers almost doubled in 2014. Staff encouraged
the authorities to promote financial inclusion through this modern medium. It noted that mobile banking
has a strong financial development potential, if adequately regulated. Staff recommended updating the
mobile banking legal framework, in coordination with the appropriate regional authorities, to better
meet the business needs of the various market stakeholders (mobile operators, financial institutions).
28.
Bank supervision at national and regional levels has improved. At the national level, the
deployment of the central information database on banks and large MFIs by the national directorate of
the central bank (BEAC) should boost financial intermediation. This tool will also allow the eventual
creation of a credit bureau and of a repository of the balance sheets of credit institutions and major
MFIs. Staff recommended the full implementation of this tool, which could help control financial risks
and improve the performance of the most vulnerable institutions. At the community level, the
institutional capacity of the regional supervisor (COBAC) has strengthened through the doubling in the
number of inspectors and the deployment of a new on-line financial reporting tool. This has improved
the quality of bank supervision in Cameroon as well. However, the slow process of adopting new
regulation delays the modernization of the prudential framework and prevents progression toward a
more efficient supervisory system.
Authorities’ views
29.
COBAC continued to monitor developments in the financial sector. Its representatives noted
that in spite of an increase in NPLs in the banking sector, the situation remained broadly satisfactory, but
there were some vulnerabilities in three small troubled banks. The Cameroonian authorities continued to
explore options to address the troubled banks, which entailed, inter alia, reaching agreements with
shareholders. One key issue was how much the state should contribute to the banks’ recapitalization.
They noted that banks’ NPLs increased because of stricter loan portfolio management in a problem bank
and more stringent risk management in another. They also noted that provisions had increased to reflect
this. They further noted that the increased level of MFIs’ NPLs may reflect better reporting within their
new financial reporting system, rather than an actual increase thereof. They were working on integrating
the reporting of MFIs’ NPLs into the overall financial sector reporting. COBAC is developing regional
regulations to consolidate the MFI sector, including higher minimum capital requirements and new
corporate governance rules.
30.
The authorities expressed concern about possible spillovers from the twin shocks to other
CEMAC countries’ financial systems. They worried about potential inbound financial spillovers from
Equatorial Guinea and the Republic of the Congo, also affected by the oil price shock, through the
subsidiaries of Cameroonian banks in those countries, which could experience a rise in NPLs. They
considered most financial institutions in Cameroon sound, but admitted that the persistence of low oil
prices could put some institutions under stress. They recognized that the fall in oil revenues and the
scaling up of public investment had reduced systemic liquidity, but noted that banks still had ample
excess deposits at the BEAC. The COBAC regretted the delays in the adoption of community-wide
banking regulations, which it thought required better coordination with the BEAC, and a more effective
CEMAC Commission to publish all CEMAC-wide regulations on a timely basis.

E. Reform Scenario
31.
Staff recommended a reform scenario, which would promote more sustainable growth
(Text Table 3, and Tables 10–12). Staff’s policy advice has been incorporated into a moderate reform
scenario with the following features (i) an acceleration of private sector-led growth through faster
improvements in the business environment, the faster completion of new infrastructure, and an
expansion of private sector credit brought about by a reduction in bank claims on SONARA; (ii) the
acceleration of PFM reforms aiming at more effective commitment control and faster improvements in
tax and customs administrations; and (iii) greater fiscal space from a moratorium on the launch of nonpriority new investments, better financial stewardship of SOEs, and improved control over mandatory
expenditures, such as wages and pensions.

The reform scenario could result in higher growth of about ½ percentage point of GDP
per year in the medium term. This would involve the completion and launch of new infrastructure in
a more business-friendly environment, with easier access to credit, easier regional commerce, and the
reallocation of public expenditure toward more productive uses. Inflation would remain subdued. Fiscal
balances would improve: non-oil revenue could be expected to increase by about 1 percentage point
per year in the medium term, supported by accelerated administrative reforms to widen the tax base,
the paring down of tax and customs exemptions, and a narrower scope of the 2013 investment
incentives law. The tighter fiscal path and structural reforms to boost competitiveness would
strengthen external and fiscal sustainability sufficiently to contain the risk of external debt distress
(Figure 5).

The authorities concurred with the objective of higher, sustainable growth and opined
that the planned surge in infrastructure investment would deliver those results. They expressed
confidence that expanded infrastructure would boost economic growth, and yield higher exports and
government revenue, thereby making their development model sustainable. In general, they endorsed
staff recommendations, but insisted on a pace of implementation more in line with Cameroon’s
administrative and social realities.

STAFF APPRAISAL
34.
Cameroon has shown, so far, resilience in the face of adverse international and security
environments. The economy has continued to grow at a brisk space in 2014–15 and inflation has
remained low, in spite of a large increase in administered retail gasoline prices in July 2014.
35.
The lack of adjustment to the oil-price shock has resulted in raising the risk of external
debt distress to “high.” The authorities’ growth strategy has shifted from progressively addressing
the public infrastructure gap to boosting growth by launching an ambitious supplemental investment
program. This program consists of additional large infrastructure projects, financed by nonconcessional debt. Under this approach, Cameroon’s risk of debt distress has been elevated to high.
The outlook for debt sustainability would be exacerbated in the event that a first-time Eurobond were
to proceed. Staff therefore urged the authorities to focus their efforts on projects nearing completion
and to postpone the contemplated Eurobond issue.
36.
The role of the private sector will be critical in supporting the transition from public to
private sector-led development. Staff recommended improving the business environment by
reducing bureaucratic impediments, in particular in the areas of tax payments and intra-CEMAC
trading, increasing anti-corruption efforts, and strengthening the implementation of the anti-money
laundering framework. A realistic and comprehensive budget is also needed for the government to
stay current with its payment obligations to the private sector. Given the difficult circumstances
confronting CEMAC, Cameroon may want to seize the opportunity to revive the stalled regional
integration process, which would support economic diversification and productivity growth in
Cameroon’s non-oil sector.
37.
Substantial risks to the budget need to be urgently addressed. Lower-than-budgeted oil
revenue and unexpected security expenditures are putting stress on fiscal sustainability and are leading
to large financing gaps and a further accumulation of domestic arrears. Contingent liabilities, arising
from SOEs, pose an additional risk, which requires better transparency of their accounts. The potential
for a re-emergence of fuel subsidies, from a possible upturn in oil prices, should be prevented through
the elimination of the fuel-subsidy scheme. At the present juncture, this could be done without
changing retail gasoline prices, with vulnerable groups protected against possible future price rises
through the deployment of a targeted social safety net. A plan to formalize and unwind the web of
cross-debts between the state, SONARA, and its commercial partners should be drawn up and
implemented. PFM needs strengthening beyond renewed efforts to monitor expenditure and the
budget needs to be restored to a rational allocation and an effective control mechanism. Staff
welcomed the forthcoming rolling out of a new tool to reconcile the payroll with the civil service
registers. Staff recommended abandoning the practice of parallel expenditure channels through the
SNH, which undermines fiscal discipline.
38.
Increasing fiscal space will require a combination of improved revenue collection,
expenditure restraint, and judicious financing choices. Staff commended the improved
performance of the tax administration, and emphasized a steadfast continuation of reforms to increase
non-oil revenue. Extending this good performance to the realm of customs, in line with IMF technical
20

assistance advice, is another potential source of increased resources. The authorities need to sustain
the implementation of program budgeting, which should help identify less productive expenditure
items that should be scaled back. Resourcing a consolidated and scaled-down public investment plan
should prioritize concessional loans.
39.
Improvements to financial intermediation are needed for public and private investment.
Although risks to financial sector stability may have abated somewhat, banking sector excess liquidity
has declined—but remains ample—and NPLs have increased. Staff therefore encouraged the
authorities to collaborate with the regional financial sector regulator to strengthen financial sector
supervision, including of the new bank for SMEs. Staff stressed the importance of better supervising
MFIs, as some of these have become very large.
40.
Data are broadly adequate for surveillance, but there are important shortcomings that
need to be addressed. Incomplete and delayed fiscal and balance of payments data can cause the
authorities to miss early warning signals.
41.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation take place on the 12-month
consultation cycle.

Historical and budget figures exclude direct, custom, and VAT taxes due by SONARA which were subject to cross-cancellations against
fuel subsidies due to SONARA (i.e., the revenue is presented on a net basis). From 2015 onward, projections for these taxes are made on a
gross basis.

Historical and budget figures exclude direct, custom, and VAT taxes due by SONARA which were subject to cross-cancellations against
fuel subsidies due to SONARA (i.e., the revenue is presented on a net basis). From 2015 onward, projections for these taxes are made on a
gross basis.

Annex II. Cameroon: External Stability Assessment1
Cameroon’s real effective exchange rate (REER) appears on average to be broadly aligned with relevant
current account norms. The REER is assessed using the three approaches of the Consultative Group on
Exchange Rate Issues (CGER), a methodology adapted to oil-exporting countries; and two “EBA-lite”
approaches.2 The findings are broadly consistent with the 2015 Central African Economic and Monetary
Community’s (CEMAC) external assessment results.3 The analysis of non-price indicators highlights the
continued need for Cameroon to improve its external competitiveness through structural reforms.

A. Balance of Payment and Exchange Rate Developments
1.
Cameroon’s external current account has fluctuated over the last decade. Since 2004,
the current account deficit has averaged about 2.4 percent of GDP (Figure 1.). It registered a surplus

balance has deteriorated from a surplus of
1.6 percent of GDP in 2006 to a deficit of 3.4 percent of GDP in 2014. Net current transfers have
made consistently positive contribution to the current account, through grants, tax revenue from
non-residents, and workers’ remittances. Conversely, the net income account has been making a
systematically negative contribution to the current account, owing to the weight of debt service.

The external stability assessment of CEMAC (IMF Country Report No. 15/222, July 2015) found that CEMAC’s REER
was overvalued, but was within the margin of error, indicating that the REER was broadly consistent with equilibrium
under current policies.

Cameroon’s real effective
exchange rate (REER) depreciated after the global recession of 2009, but reverted to a slight
appreciation in 2013 and 2014

exchange rate (NEER) closely following
this trend. The trend reflects the depreciation and subsequent rebound of the nominal effective
exchange rate of the euro, to which Cameroon’s common currency is pegged.
5.
The current account deficit is expected to widen to 5.2 percent of GDP in 2015–20. The
goods and services balance is also expected to deteriorate from a deficit of 3.4 percent of GDP
in 2014 to a deficit of 4.1 percent in 2015–20. In 2014, approximately 42 percent of export proceeds
came from oil. This share is expected to decline to an average of 37.6 percent of exports in 2015–20.
The current account deficit would be primarily financed by external borrowing.
6.
As a preliminary assessment, and assuming that the purchasing power parity holds for
ten years, Cameroon’s current REER appears to be appropriately valued. The first approach for
assessing the REER is to assume that

approach indicates that REER has been

CAMEROON

broadly in line with the equilibrium value. One important determinant of Cameroon’s LREER is its
terms of trade, which has been on a broadly rising trend since 2009. This indicates that the LREER
may have shifted. In addition, Cameroon’s non-oil current account deficit has been improving
recently (Figure 5), suggesting a possible undervaluation of the REER. Because of these diverging
results, the utility of these approaches may be limited by the strong assumptions on the LREER made
for this preliminary assessment.

B. Model-Based Real Exchange Rate Assessments

The REER is assessed using the three CGER approaches, namely, the macroeconomic

8.
Results from the MB approach suggest that the REER is undervalued in 2015. The
estimated current account norm points to a deficit of 5.3 percent, while the underlying current
account deficit is about 5.1 percent. Accordingly and depending on the current account elasticity
used, the MB approach suggests that the real exchange rate is undervalued by between 1.0 percent
and 1.2 percent. If a country’s current account elasticity with respect to the REER is higher, then the
magnitude of the real exchange rate adjustment that is needed to close the current account gap
would be smaller.
9.
Conversely, the ES approach suggests that the REER is overvalued in 2015. The current
account stabilizing net foreign assets represents a deficit of 1.9 percent of GDP, compared to a
5.1 percent underlying current account deficit. The ES approach therefore suggests that the REER is
overvalued by between 19.1 percent and 21.7 percent, depending on the current account elasticity to
the real exchange rate.
10.
The ERER approach suggests the REER is undervalued in 2015. The ERER is estimated to
appreciate by 5.9 percent, while the underlying REER appreciated by only 0.8 percent. Therefore, in
order to restore real exchange rate equilibrium, the ERER approach suggests that the REER would
need to appreciate by 5.1 percent. The 90 percent confidence interval gives an undervaluation of
between 2.9 percent and 7.3 percent.

11.
To complement the above analysis, the ES approach is tailored to oil-producing
countries.4,5 External sustainability is particularly important for exhaustible natural resource
producers like Cameroon. Therefore an additional external assessment was carried out based on
Bems and Carvalho (IMF, 2012). In the case of oil producers where oil represents a relatively small
share of economic activity, as in Cameroon, it is important to account for oil imports as well as oil

oil revenues is saved to produce a

Sources: Cameroonian authorities and IMF staff estimates.

12.
This tailored ES approach suggests a current account norm of 0.5 percent of GDP
in 2015 under the constant real annuity scenario, corresponding to an overvaluation of
Cameroon’s REER of about 17.6 percent. This result, however, should be considered in light of the
fact that international capital market imperfections and immediate development needs create an
argument for countries to invest in domestic infrastructure instead of investing in savings abroad. In
other words, when external borrowing is constrained, the optimal response to a natural resource
windfall implies a smaller current account surplus than otherwise. However, investment inefficiencies
and absorptive capacity constraints also imply that the ability of domestic investment is limited in
acting as a domestic savings mechanism, consequently warranting larger current account surpluses.
In either case, the transitory nature of oil revenues in Cameroon could suggest investing a larger
proportion of these revenues in safe assets with reasonable yields, be it abroad or at home. The
tailored ES approach is complemented by two “EBA-lite” approaches (Box 1).
13.
Taken together, the assessment of Cameroon’s REER does not indicate a significant
misalignment with the current account norm. On average, the CGER methodologies and Bems
and Carvalho indicate an 8.0 percent overvaluation of the REER in 2015, confirming last year’s
exchange rate assessment. The EBA-lite methodologies show an average undervaluation of
10.1 percent in 2015. It is important to note, however, that the above results are sensitive not only to
the macroeconomic assumptions on which the baseline scenario is predicated, but also to the
assumptions each approach uses, such as the level of elasticity of the current account to the real
exchange rate.

Box 1. Cameroon: EBA-Lite Real Effective Exchange Rate Assessment
The two approaches of the “EBA-lite” model, the EBA-lite current account (CA) and the EBA-lite
index REER (IREER) indicate that Cameroon’s REER is undervalued in 2015. The EBA-lite is not the
most appropriate methodology to assess the exchange rate for oil-exporting countries and it was
not used for the real exchange rate assessment of CEMAC. However, since Cameroon is a small
net oil exporter, EBA-lite estimates were used to shed more light on the exchange rate
assessment. In the CA model, the estimated current account norm points to a deficit of
6.6 percent, compared to the underlying 5.1 percent. Accordingly, with an elasticity of the current
account to REER at -0.15, the approach suggests that REER is undervalued by 9.8 percent. The
IREER approach indicates that REER is undervalued by 10.3 percent (Table 1).

C. Assessment of Structural Competitiveness
14.
Cameroon’s weak institutional indicators point to significant issues in structural
competitiveness. Competitiveness is defined by the World Economic Forum as the set of institutions
and factors that determine the level of productivity of a country. As illustrated below, Cameroon’s
low ranking suggests a weak structural competitiveness and would imply an exchange rate
overvaluation. The surveys considered in this section include: the World Economic Forum’s Global
Competitiveness Index (GCI); the Heritage Foundation indicators of economic freedom; the World
Bank’s Doing Business indicators; and the World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional
Assessment (CPIA).
15.
According to the 2014-15 GCI report, Cameroon ranks 116th of 148 surveyed countries,
losing one place since the 2013–14 report, but maintaining a score of 3.7 of 7 in the
competitiveness index. Within sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), Cameroon ranks 15th of 32, above the
region’s average (Figure 8, Panel 1). The country obtained worse scores than the SSA average in two
of the three sub-indices: basic requirements, efficiency enhancers, and factors of innovation and
sophistication. In terms of the 12 other indicators, Cameroon fares better than SSA only in two
categories: innovation and market size. The two indicators that are ranked the lowest are
infrastructure and technology readiness, ranking 126th and 120th, respectively.
16.
According to the Heritage Foundation, Cameroon continued to score below the world
average in 2015 with respect to freedom from corruption and the protection of property
rights, despite some marginal improvements. Overall, Cameroon slipped in the Foundation’s
40

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CAMEROON

rankings from136th to 146th, losing ten places. At 52.6, Cameroon’s index qualifies the economy as
‘mostly unfree’ and is below the average of SSA’s 120th rank and the West African Economic and
Monetary Union’s (WAEMU) 117th rank, but better than the CEMAC’s 154th rank. In eight of the ten
Heritage Foundation indicators of economic freedom, Cameroon scores lower than the SSA average
(Figure 8, Panel 2). Overall, Cameroon’s total score index worsened slightly from 52.6 in 2014
to 51.9 in 2015.
17.
Cameroon’s business climate, as measured by the 2015 World Bank Doing Business
indicators, has deteriorated since last year and the country’s rank is lower than the average
rank for SSA. The country has lost ten places since 2014, slipping to 158th (out of 189) from 148th
last year. Cameroon has made it easier to obtain a building permit by decentralizing the process and
by introducing strict time limits, but the notification and inspection requirements has made the
process more complex on balance. Cameroon ranks well (52nd) in the time and cost required to
obtain a permanent electricity connection for a newly constructed warehouse. However, except for
registering property and getting electricity, Cameroon’s ranking deteriorated in all other aspects of
doing business compared to last year. The country ranks 181st with respect to paying taxes (Figure 8,
Panel 3).
18.
Cameroon’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) score of 3.2 (out of 6)
in 2014 was the same as SSA’s average and above the average of the CEMAC (2.9), but slightly
below WAEMU’s average of 3.3 (Figure 9). Although Cameroon’s scores in major areas exceed the
scores of CEMAC and are strong in economic management compared with SSA, they lag SSA in
social inclusion and public sector management. Areas for improvement are in property rights
management, rule-based governance, transparency, accountability and, corruption.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most
likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of
the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability
between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability of 30 percent of more). The RAM reflects staff views on the
source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive
risks may interact and materialize jointly.

The MDRI provides 100 percent debt relief to eligible member countries that qualified for the
assistance. Grant assistance from the MDRI Trust and HIPC resources provide debt relief to cover
the full stock of debt owed to the Fund as of end-2004 that remains outstanding at the time the
member qualifies for such debt relief.

Decision point - point at which the IMF and the World Bank determine whether a country

CAMEROON

qualifies for assistance under the HIPC Initiative and decide on the amount of assistance to be
committed.
Interim assistance - amount disbursed to a country during the period between decision and
completion points, up to 20 percent annually and 60 percent in total of the assistance
committed at the decision point (or 25 percent and 75 percent, respectively, in exceptional
circumstances).
Completion point - point at which a country receives the remaining balance of its assistance
committed at the decision point, together with an additional disbursement of interest income as
defined in footnote 2 above. The timing of the completion point is linked to the implementation
of pre-agreed key structural reforms (i.e., floating completion point).
Implementation of Post-Catastrophe Debt Relief (PCDR): Not Applicable
Safeguards Assessments:
Consistent with the safeguards policy requirement for regional central banks, the Banque des
États d’Afrique Centrale (BEAC) was subject to a quadrennial assessment in 2013. It occurred
against the backdrop of significant change at the BEAC to address governance challenges and
control failures that emerged in 2009, and led to close engagement in the period after through
close IMF monitoring of safeguards “rolling measures” in the context of new program requests and
reviews for the Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC) countries. The 2013
assessment found that risks remained elevated and that annual IMF staff visits to monitor priority
recommendations and progress on the BEAC’s reform plan would continue as part of the
safeguards “rolling measures” approach.1 As such, a safeguards staff visit to the BEAC was
conducted in April 2015. Staff concluded that while the BEAC had continued the implementation of
its reform plan, slippages had occurred and the timeframe of the reform and modernization plan
(RMP) had been revised. Progress on implementing the safeguards rolling measures has been
mixed, and priority recommendations on amendments to the BEAC charter and adoption of an
internationally-recognized financial reporting framework (IFRS) are delayed. Strong actions and
close coordination with member states to gain consensus will be needed in the period ahead for
the BEAC to conclude its reforms and the outstanding safeguards recommendations. Progress on
implementation of the latter will remain subject to monitoring by the IMF, as a condition to
continuing new program requests and reviews for CEMAC member countries.

B. Nonfinancial Relations
Exchange Arrangements:
Cameroon participates in a currency union with five other members of the CEMAC and has no
separate legal tender. Cameroon’s currency, the CFA franc, is pegged to the euro at the fixed rate
of CFAF 655.957 per euro. Local currency equivalent: CFAF 749.7=SDR 1, as of
December 31, 2014. Effective January 1, 2007, the exchange arrangement of the CEMAC
countries was reclassified as a “conventional pegged arrangement” and not anymore as an
“exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender.” The new classification is based on the
behavior of the common currency, whereas the previous classification was based on the lack of a
separate legal tender. The new classification thus reflects only a definitional change, and is not
based on a judgment that there has been a substantive change in the exchange regime or other
policies of the currency union or its members.
Cameroon maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers for current international transactions, except for restrictions maintained for security
reasons that have been notified to the IMF pursuant to Executive Board decision 144 152/51.
Article IV Consultation:
The last Article IV consultation with Cameroon was concluded by the Executive Board on
July 9, 2014.
FSAP Participation and ROSCs:
A Financial System Stability Assessment (FSSA) report was issued in May 2000. An update of the
FSSA was completed in February 2009, based on the work of a joint IMF-World Bank mission that
visited Cameroon as part of the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) in June 2007, itself
building upon the CEMAC regional FSAP that was conducted in 2006. A CEMAC regional FSAP
update was conducted in 2015.
The first Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) on fiscal transparency and
transparency of monetary and financial policies for Cameroon was issued in June 2000.
A fiscal ROSC reassessment mission visited Yaoundé, Cameroon, during May 6–18, 2009. Its
report was issued in June 2010.

World Bank Work Program
Strategy: The new Country Engagement Framework calls for a Systematic Country Diagnostic
(SCD) to be conducted to identify the main development constraints of the country to inform
the Country Partnership Framework (CPF). The CPF will identify the areas in which the Bank will
engage Cameroon in 2015–20 in light of its corporate strategy of ending extreme poverty
by 2030 and promoting shared prosperity by fostering income growth of the poor. Although
these analytical endeavors are ongoing, preliminary results indicate that extreme poverty is
endemic in four provinces and growth has not been strong enough to make a dent in poverty
reduction. While the CPF is developed, the Bank will help stimulate more inclusive growth by
improving competitiveness through (i) increased investment in the energy, transportation, and
agriculture sectors; (ii) activities geared toward ensuring the transparent, equitable, and
sustainable use of natural resources; and (iii) promotion of high potential value chains and
improved business climate. For service delivery, the emphasis is on (i) human development
(education, health, and social protection to help develop an effective safety net system based
on targeted programs); and (ii) local development, where the focus will be on increasing access
to basic services through infrastructure upgrading and capacity building for improved local
governance.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
A. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance purposes.
There is scope for improvements in quality, coverage, and timeliness in most macroeconomic
datasets. In recent years, the authorities have taken initiative to improve the macroeconomic
database, particularly the national accounts.
Real sector statistics: The Institut National de la Statistique du Cameroun (INS) has released in
December 2013 a revised set of national accounts estimates including key features of the System
of National Accounts 2008 (2008 SNA). Further improvements could be made in some areas,
including the production index, which should be overhauled and integrated with the
corresponding components of the annual national accounts; the selection of price indices for
deflation of national accounts concepts; and information on employment. The STA missions
in 2009, 2010, and 2011 supported the compilation of improved national accounts statistics,
including quarterly national accounts statistics starting in 2012. A rebasing to 2005 of national
accounts was completed, but has not yet been implemented.
Government finance statistics: The quality of fiscal data is broadly adequate for surveillance, but
has some shortcomings in coverage, periodicity, timeliness, and accessibility. Monthly reports on
the overall budget execution and the investment budget execution have been produced on a
continuous basis. Despite this progress, there is a need for the dissemination of data based on the
Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001). Weaknesses in the fiscal data include:
(i) incomplete compilation of budget implementation data on a commitment and, to some extent,
on a cash basis; (ii) a lack of information on the financial information of local governments;
(iii) poor monitoring of cross-liabilities in the public sector and of public enterprise debt; and
(iv) lack of comprehensive and timely financial information on public enterprises.
The authorities plan to establish comprehensive fiscal accounts on a commitment basis, a
functional classification of the budget and will strive to monitor the float (i.e., the difference
between balances on a cash and on a commitment basis). Moreover, the ongoing audit of
government domestic debt, which will cover cross-liabilities in the public sector and public
enterprise external debt, is expected to strengthen debt data. Efforts to enhance transparency of
financial operations in the oil sector should also improve overall fiscal reporting. Efforts are also
underway to collect data on the operations of the largest 20 public enterprises.
Monetary and financial statistics: Monetary statistics are reported to the Fund by the Banque des
États de l’Afrique Centrale (BEAC) on a monthly basis in the standardized report forms (SRFs), with
delays of up to two months. A key shortcoming of monetary and financial statistics is the lack of
data for interest rates offered by financial institutions to non-financial entities on deposits and
loans. In addition, the depository corporation survey does not include data from deposit taking
microfinance institutions, a fast growing sector in the country.

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CAMEROON

Balance of payments: Since the March 2006 STA technical assistance, the authorities have started
to produce higher quality data, albeit with significant delays, partly due to delays in reporting
financial and capital account data from BEAC. Balance of payments data are reported annually to
STA albeit with some lags. The latest reported data refer to 2011.
External debt: External debt data are broadly adequate for surveillance, but are comprehensive
only for public and explicitly guaranteed debt. Data are collected by the Caisse Autonome
d'Amortissement (CAA), which is responsible for servicing the government's external debt
obligations. The CAA's database is fairly comprehensive, contains accurate stock data, and
produces projected debt-service flows on a loan-by-loan basis. However debt disbursement and
position statements are not regularly received from some foreign creditors, which causes
significant impairment to real-time and comprehensive debt monitoring.
B. Data Standards and Quality
Cameroon commenced its participation in the
General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) in 2001.

No ROSC data are available.

C. Reporting to STA
Cameroon does not report data for publication in the IMF Government Finance Statistics
Yearbook or the government finance statistics section in International Financial Statistics. Data
reporting for publication in the Fund’s Balance of Payments Statistics publications has encountered
delays.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITYANALYSIS

Approved By
Anne-Marie Gulde-Wolf
and Bob Traa (IMF); and
John Panzer (IDA)

The Debt Sustainability Analysis has been prepared
jointly by IMF and World Bank staff, in consultation with the
authorities, using the debt sustainability framework for lowincome countries approved by the Boards of both
institutions.

This Debt Sustainability Analysis finds that Cameroon’s risk of external debt distress increased
from “moderate” to “high” between the last consultation and end-2014. The recent
acceleration in the accumulation of debt, increasingly on non-concessional terms, and the
significant deterioration in the outlook for exports are the main causes of the higher risk
rating. The policy-dependent threshold for the present value of debt to exports is breached in
2021 under the baseline scenario. In addition, standard stress tests result in the breaches of
two policy-dependent thresholds. The risk of total debt distress is also “high.” Rising domestic
borrowing leads to a breach in the policy-dependent benchmark for the ratio of the present
value of total public debt to GDP. The analysis does not reflect the possible issue of a
Eurobond. The inclusion of the Eurobond would reinforce the conclusion of a “high” risk of
external debt distress. To mitigate risks and underpin debt sustainability in the medium term,
significant adjustments in the amounts and terms of both external and domestic borrowing
are necessary.

CAMEROON

BACKGROUND
1.
This Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) of Cameroon’s public debt was prepared jointly by
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. It builds on the 2014 DSA (IMF Country
Report No. 14/212)1 and uses the latest standard dynamic debt template for low-income countries (LIC),
based on data from the authorities for end-2014 (Text Table 1), and the macroeconomic framework derived
from the 2015 IMF Article IV consultation. The assessment is based on data for external and domestic debt
of the central government, as well as implicitly or explicitly guaranteed external debt of public enterprises,2
which are contingent liabilities of the government, amounting to CFAF 527 billion at end-2014. Debt
statistics would benefit from a more comprehensive coverage of the government’s contingent liabilities, and
the liabilities of public enterprises and municipalities.

The draft DSA was discussed with the Cameroonian authorities in the course of the 2015 Article IV consultation. This
DSA follows the IMF and World Bank Staff Guidance Note on the Application of the Joint IMF-World Bank Debt
Sustainability Framework for Low-Income Countries, dated November 7, 2013.

External debt is defined as debt owed to non-residents and issued in a foreign currency. In the case of arrears to
suppliers, these are defined as overdue payment obligations that have not been fulfilled before the standard 90-day
settlement period for such obligations.

Cameroon’s total public debt was estimated at 26.6 percent of GDP at end-2014. This
compares to a ratio of below 10 percent of GDP in 2008, following the completion of the enhanced Heavily
Indebted Poor Countries and Multilateral Debt Relief Initiatives. Total public and publicly guaranteed
debt (PPG) increased sharply in 2014, as the government sought financing to support its expanding public
investment program. PPG accounted for the most significant share of total debt, with private, nonguaranteed debt representing only 5 percent thereof. PPG is broadly made up of two thirds external and
one third domestic debt.
3.
The accumulation of non-concessional external debt was the main driver of the increase in
PPG. New non-concessional PPG was mainly driven by the strong increase in new bilateral disbursements
from non-Paris Club (NPC) members. These accounted for two thirds of all disbursements in 2014. In terms
of disbursed and outstanding debt, new NPC loans increased from 4.3 percent of PPG in 2008 to
25.9 percent of PPG in 2014.
4.
Cameroon’s debt management capacity has shown some improvement in recent years, but
critical shortcomings remain. IMF technical assistance has focused on rationalizing debt management
functions to ensure clearer roles and responsibilities. Since the last DSA, a National Debt Committee, chaired
by the Minister of Finance, has started reviewing externally financed project proposals. However, the
contracting of external debt is still undertaken by both the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economy,
Planning, and Regional Development. At the same time, the timely tracking of loan disbursements is
inadequate, often leading to significant belated upward adjustments in external debt figures.

ASSUMPTIONS
5.
Compared to the 2014 DSA, the macroeconomic framework reflects (i) a significant decline
in export revenues owing, inter alia, to the slump in world oil prices; and (ii) a strong rise in foreign
financing of capital investment. These developments result in a less favorable outlook for exports, fiscal
revenue, and debt accumulation (Text Table 2 and Box 1).


The lower outlook for exports compared to the 2014 DSA affects both oil and non-oil
developments. For oil exports, this reflects the expected decline in oil production, as indicated by
the authorities, combined with the much lower oil price in the 2014 DSA.3 For non-oil exports,
volume growth is expected to remain strong, albeit lower than the projections made in the
2014 DSA, reaching 6.5 percent per annum in the medium term. The downward revision in
projections for non-oil export growth reflects weaker prospects in some key export markets
(e.g., China and Europe).



The profile of external debt accumulation reflects the authorities’ commitment to accelerate their
program of externally financed public investments significantly. The increase in debt is expected

3

The assumptions for the 2015 DSA for the growth of oil export volumes are more favorable than the authorities’ own
projections, which envisage a sharp decline starting in 2017. The 2015 DSA also incorporates liquefied natural gas
(LNG) exports from 2018 onward, with volumes in line with the authorities’ forecast, but with lower prices (based on
prices on the largest LNG market—New Orleans, USA).

to be mainly sourced from the CFAF 2,800 billion stock of signed but as-yet undisbursed loans,
which have mostly been contracted on non-concessional terms.
Against this background, growth in the medium-term is expected to be supported by continued
strong investment expenditure; the coming on stream of large infrastructure projects; and strong
activity in agriculture, energy generation, and transport.
6.
The main financing assumptions remain broadly unchanged, including the terms of new
external borrowing. The discount rate is 5 percent, as approved by the IMF and World Bank Executive
Boards in October 2013. Some contingent liabilities in public enterprises have been left out because their
overall amounts remain hard to quantify. Fiscal financing gaps are assumed to be financed by borrowing,
which in turn leads to an accumulation of domestic debt. The latter, however, does not come into play when
assessing the risk of external debt distress.

Some assumptions have been adjusted marginally. The DSA assigns a larger role to creditors
whose loans are non-concessional, especially in 2015–17, given specific information on undisbursed loans.
New non-concessional creditors, such as China, the IBRD, and the African Development Bank, are projected
to play larger roles than in the past. Non-concessional external borrowing is projected to exceed 80 percent
of new external borrowing in 2015 and its share continues to rise throughout the forecast period (Text
Table 3). The projected financing gaps are assumed to bear a positive interest rate of 1.5 percent on the
resulting domestic debt.

Box 1. Cameroon: Macroeconomic Assumptions for the Baseline Scenario1
Medium Term, 2016–20
Real GDP growth is projected to average of 5.2 percent in the medium term, supported by a strong domestic
demand and large public investments. Annual inflation is projected to remain low, at around 2 percent, in
line with historical trends and below the CEMAC convergence criterion.
The revenue-to-GDP ratio is projected to decline over the medium term, from 17.4 percent of GDP in 2015 to
16.6 percent of GDP in 2020. Oil prices are expected to stabilize at about US$60 per barrel in the medium
term. The technology used to increase aging well production is more expensive and will reduce oil revenue
in proportion.
The external current account deficit is projected to remain marginally above 5 percent of GDP in 2016–20, as
the economy adjusts to the terms-of-trade shock experienced in 2015.2 This reflects, in volume terms, both
falling oil exports and a slowdown in imported equipment goods for infrastructure projects, as the public
investment program slows down. Despite strong volume growth, non-oil export proceeds are expected to be
held back by low prices for traditional exports. As before, the current account deficit is expected to be
financed through external public borrowing and other private capital inflows.
Long Term, 2021–35
Real GDP growth is projected to average 4.8 percent in the long term, as public investment slows down.
The revenue-to-GDP ratio is projected to decrease from 16.9 percent of GDP in 2021 to 14.9 percent of GDP
in 2035. This trend assumes a decline in oil revenue with the gradual depletion of oil reserves, while non-oil
revenue is sustained by improved revenue collection.
The external current account deficit is projected to average about 4.6 percent of GDP in 2021-35. This reflects
slower growth in imports, in line with the lower public investment. Growth in exports of goods is projected to
decline, reflecting falling oil production, which is only partially offset by growth in non-oil exports and
exports of services.
________________________________________
1

The baseline scenario uses the latest IMF World Economic Outlook (WEO) assumptions (August 2015).

2

The outlook for exports is adversely affected by the substantial terms-of-trade shock experienced by Cameroon in 2015. In addition
to the decline in the price of oil, prices for most of Cameroon’s traditional exports (wood, coffee, etc.) also declined. Thus, despite
strong volume growth for both oil and non-oil exports, overall exports of goods are projected to decrease by 6.5 percent in value
terms in 2015. These trends are accentuated by exchange rate movements, which further reinforce the decline in exports when
calculated in US dollar terms. The projections incorporate further declines in prices in 2016 and beyond for some non-oil exports in
line with the WEO.

EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
8.
An assessment of public sector performance, based on the World Bank Country Policy and
Institutional Assessment (CPIA), puts Cameroon in the category of weak policy and institutional
capacity. In line with the standard approach for the LIC DSA, the critical sustainability thresholds depend on
the CPIA. Cameroon’s rating of 3.21 on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high) has remained stable in the past three
years. It is better than the Economic and Monetary Community of Central Africa (CEMAC) average (2.9) and
in line with the sub-Saharan African (SSA) average. The specific thresholds for this category are a (i) present
value (PV) of debt-to-exports ratio of 100 percent; (ii) PV of the debt-to-revenue ratio of 200 percent; (iii) PV
of the debt service-to-exports ratio of 30 percent; (iv) debt service-to-exports ratio of 15 percent; and
(v) debt service-to-revenue ratio of 18 percent (Text Table 4).
9.
The baseline scenario results in the breach of the PV of the debt-to-exports ratio in 2021.
This breach occurs relatively early, is sustained over time, and sees the ratio exceeding 130. This reflects the
combined effects of a further acceleration in external debt accumulation along with weaker export earnings.
The latter is affected by the substantial decline the prices of Cameroon’s main exports compared to
the 2014 DSA. The increasing recourse to non-concessional external financing also has an adverse impact
on the outlook (Table 1, Panel c). A breach of one of the thresholds, as in this case, results in the
categorization of debt sustainability as “high.”
10.
Standard stress tests result in the breach of the policy-dependent threshold for two ratios.
Stress tests bring forward the breach of the PV of the-debt-to-exports ratio to 2017 and result in an
additional breach for the debt-service-to-exports ratio in 2023. This ratio is projected to exceed the
15 percent threshold in 2023 and remain above this level for the remainder of the forecast period.

11.
The authorities are considering a Eurobond issue, which would further increase Cameroon’s risk
of external debt distress. Preparations have been made to issue such a bond for an amount of US$1.5 billion,
which corresponds to about 5 percent of GDP.4 Because it would front-load the accumulation of new disbursed
and outstanding debt, the proposed Eurobond would cause an even earlier breach of the policy-dependent
threshold for the PV of the debt-to-exports ratio under the baseline scenario. At prevailing bond yield levels,
debt sustainability would deteriorate. This assessment is reinforced when costs associated with derivative
hedging instruments are factored in.
12.
Downside risks dominate Cameroon’s external debt outlook. Inadequate checks and balances in
the contracting of new debt, combined with difficulties in tracking disbursements, have led to consistently
higher actual external debt disbursement figures than had been projected initially. Moreover, any refinancing of
external debt payments falling due with new external financing would add to the stock of such debt.
4

According to the authorities, possible terms of the Eurobond issue are a maturity of ten years; a fixed interest rate;
and a bullet repayment in year ten.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PUBLIC SECTOR DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
13.
In line with previous DSAs, public debt is projected to rise significantly faster than external debt,
reflecting continued recourse to domestic financing. Domestic borrowing will also be needed to cover
financing gaps, which are projected to persist over the medium and long terms. Against this background, the PV
of debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to breach the policy dependent benchmark of 38 percent in 2024, whilst
averaging over 45 percent of GDP in 2021–35. The ratio of debt service to revenue and the PV of debt-to-revenue
show similar strongly rising trends. This serves to reinforce the conclusions of elevated debt distress from the
analysis of external debt developments.

CONCLUSIONS
14.
The acceleration in debt accumulation and the less favorable external environment give rise to
an increase in the risk of external debt distress from “moderate” to “high.” This is the result of the breach
of the policy-dependent threshold in the case of the PV of debt-to-exports ratio under the baseline scenario.
This development highlights the growing risks associated with the rapid accumulation of both external and
domestic debt against a background of a structural terms-of-trade shock. Although Cameroon’s current public
debt ratio of 26.6 percent of GDP remains manageable, it is projected to double by 2030 on current trends. The
less favorable outlook for oil prices compared to the previous DSA exacerbates the impact of the rising debt
stock on key debt ratios. Moreover, increased reliance on external financing on non-concessional terms also
entails higher debt service costs. These risks would manifest themselves yet more strongly in the event that the
envisaged Eurobond issue goes ahead. Meanwhile, the projected outlook for domestic borrowing compounds
the risk of debt distress, with the policy-dependent threshold for the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio also breached
under the baseline scenario.
15.
Staffs consider that a reorientation of debt policy is warranted in order to take account of the
less favorable external environment and guard against vulnerabilities. Recommendations to improve debt
sustainability and to reduce the risk of debt distress include:


Anchoring fiscal policy to a pace of debt accumulation that does not cause a breach of any
policy-dependent threshold under the baseline scenario;



Making greater use of concessional borrowing;



Monitoring debt developments more closely, especially for externally financed projects; and



Implementing policies to improve debt management rigorously.

16.
The authorities recognized the risks of debt distress and acknowledged the importance of
enhanced debt management and the need to monitor debt developments more closely. At the same
time, however, they considered that a more robust growth response than the one projected in the DSA from the
public investment program should result in a more benign outlook for debt sustainability. They also undertook
to make more progress in implementing technical assistance recommendations for debt management and
budget reforms.

Key macroeconomic and fiscal assumptions

Grant element of new external borrowing (in percent)

Sources: Country authorities; and staff estimates and projections.
1/ Public sector debt refers to net debt of the central government, augmented with identified publicly gauranteed debt in public enterprises.
2/ Gross financing need is defined as the primary deficit plus debt service plus the stock of short-term debt at the end of the last period.
3/ Revenues excluding grants.
4/ Debt service is defined as the sum of interest and amortization of medium and long-term debt.
5/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.

Statement by Mr. Yambaye, Executive Director for Cameroon
November 18, 2015

My Cameroonian authorities would like to thank staff for the constructive discussions held in
Douala and Yaoundé during the mission, and for the useful analysis and recommendations
highlighted in the report. The Cameroonian economy has shown resilience in recent years amid a
challenging global environment owing to its relatively diversified base. The declining oil prices
and aggravated security situation pose significant risks to the outlook. However, the authorities
remain optimistic on their capacity to continue to weather these shocks.
The authorities are mindful that much remains to be done, including maintaining a robust growth
rate and improving social indicators necessary to fulfill the ambitious 2035 development agenda.
Against this backdrop, the authorities have reservations about the staff’s appraisal, especially as
regards the public investment program and debt dynamics. In this vein, they would like to reflect
further on their decision to consent to the publication of the staff report.
I – Recent Economic Developments
Cameroon’s macroeconomic performance has been significantly resilient against severe oil
prices drop and security challenges related to the terrorist activities of Boko Haram in the Lake
Chad region. Despite this difficult environment, output increased by 5.9 percent in 2014 and is
projected to inch higher in 2015, to 6 percent, well above regional and SSA averages; driven
mostly by large public investments in the context of the 2035 development agenda, and higher
oil production. Inflation remains subdued, below the CEMAC’s convergence threshold of
3 percent.
While the fiscal deficit has increased to 4.8 percent of GDP in 2014, owing in large part to
reduced revenues from the oil price shock and increase in current expenditures, it remains
nevertheless manageable with regards to long-term sustainability.
The authorities concur with staff that developing Cameroon’s growth potential requires
continuous reforms, including in the fiscal and public finance management areas. Likewise, for
the medium term, they will continue to step up their efforts in tackling impediments to growth,
notably strengthening the financial sector, improving the business environment and pursuing
infrastructure development.
II – Medium Term Policies and Reforms
The authorities are optimistic about the medium-term prospects in view of the efforts to improve
macroeconomic indicators and the reform agenda. As regard oil production, the figures for 2015
and forward are set well above the 2014 level and could help offset the effect of the price
decline. Regarding the security situation, the authorities will pursue counter-terrorism operations
while maintaining fiscal sustainability.

2

Fiscal policy will be geared toward increasing non-oil revenue and providing more resources to
priority spending while strengthening public financial management and preserving debt
sustainability. On the spending side, the fiscal program will prioritize projects near completion
over new ones, with an emphasis on private sector-enhancing investments, including in sectors
of power generation and water supply. The continued low oil prices will help bring down further
the petroleum subsidies, thereby reducing current spending.
On the revenue side, non-oil tax and customs revenue are expected to increase considerably on
grounds of enhanced tax and customs administrations, as well as increased activity in
construction. Fiscal reforms will also focus on strengthening public finance management. In that
regards, they agree with staff on the need to improve the monitoring, accounting and reporting of
public spending. Likewise, they see merit in staff recommendations to improve expenditure
control, which they seek to achieve through the implementation of a new information technology
architecture connecting the civil service register to the payroll.
The financial sector remains broadly sound. Banks are highly profitable, liquid and continue to
grow robustly both in terms of assets and credit provisions. The authorities are mindful and
committed to address the non-performing loans (NPLs) in three small banks and microfinance
institutions. They attribute the increase in NPLs to a stricter loan portfolio management in one of
the banks and a more stringent risk management in the second one. The authorities intend to
work closely with local and regional regulatory institutions, including BEAC, CEMAC, and
COBAC to address these vulnerabilities in a holistic manner. In the same vein, they will step up
efforts to adopt the necessary legislations to implement country-wide banking regulations
recommended by the regional banking supervision body (COBAC).
Enhancing public investment, especially in infrastructure, is a core strategy for the authorities to
increase the private sector participation and lay the ground for the country’s progress towards
emerging economy status by 2035. To this end, the authorities concur with staff that projects
near completion should be prioritized. They will also consider other projects previously
identified as strategic investments in their development agenda. They are of the view that the
return on these public investments will outpace costs going forward. The government’s public
investment program will go hand in hand with its effort to improve the other aspects of the
business climate, improve competitiveness and enhance regional integration. In these efforts, the
authorities will continue to monitor and maintain long-term debt sustainability.
The authorities agree with staff on the need for a better monitoring and oversight of state-owned
enterprises, including SONARA, with the view to enhance their contribution to output and put
them on a stronger financial footing. This will also prevent inflows of SOE’s contingent
liabilities to the public budget.
III – Debt Sustainability
The Cameroonian authorities remain committed to maintain debt sustainability and will continue
their efforts to improve debt management, as they move ahead with their strategy to bolster

3

growth and economic diversification. In that regard, while public debt has increased recently due
to the financing of highly needed public investments, it should be noted that external public debt
and total public debt remains relatively low at 21.7 percent and 32.6 percent of GDP in 2015
respectively.
Unlike staff, my authorities consider that this level of debt is sustainable and should not be a
matter of concern. Furthermore, they believe that given the low indebtedness, there is financing
space to pursue a steady implementation of the investment program, and they do not think that
the recent issuance of the Eurobond would affect long-term debt sustainability as the debt ratio
will remain moderate.
As noted above, my Cameroonian authorities remain committed to prudent debt management in
their efforts to achieve sustainable growth. That said, it is worth noting that obtaining financial
grants or concessional loans to finance vital investment projects has become increasingly
difficult. The authorities will, nevertheless, always endeavor to secure concessional financing as
much as possible, and will contract non-concessional loans only in the absence of such
concessional resources and for projects that are of critical importance for the country’s growth
and development objectives. Debt sustainability will also be predicated on a more careful
investment-growth nexus analysis to better gauge the potential effects of the undertaken
investments on growth over the medium to long term.
Conclusion
Cameroon is at a crossroads of significant challenges. The authorities strongly believe that their
development plans are sensible and are based on maintaining strong macroeconomic stability.
They are committed to prudent policies aimed at ensuring strong and inclusive growth. Their
efforts will also encompass addressing forcefully the security issues. In their endeavors, the
authorities appreciate staff advice and useful recommendations.
