Discussions were held in Cairo August 29–September 12, 2007. The team comprised
Mr. Enders (head), Mr. Ilahi, Mr. Billmeier, Ms. Oner (all MCD), Mr. Almekinders
(PDR), Ms. Cebotari (FAD) and was supported by Mr. Sassanpour (Senior Resident
Representative). Ms. Scarlata (MCM) discussed the findings of the May 2007 FSAP
update mission. Mr. Shaalan and Ms. Riad (both OED) participated in the policy
discussions.

•

The mission met with Ministers Boutros-Ghali (Finance), Mohieldin (Investment), and
Osman (Economic Development), Central Bank Governor El-Okdah, and other
government officials and private sector representatives. The mission’s concluding
statement was published (http://www.imf.org/external/np/ms/2007/091207.htm).

•

On January 2, 2005, Egypt accepted the obligations under Article VIII, sections 2, 3, and
4 of the Articles of Agreement. The exchange system is free of exchange restrictions on
the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions and multiple
currency practices.

•

The de jure exchange rate regime is a managed float. While through mid-2007 the
de facto exchange rate arrangement was akin to a conventional fixed peg, in the last few
months it has been akin to a managed float.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Economic Developments
•

Egypt’s economy had another year of impressive performance supported by sustained
reforms, prudent macroeconomic management, and a favorable external environment.
Growth was strong and has become more broad-based, creating record numbers of jobs.
Investor confidence remains high.

•

Inflation returned to single digits after a temporary surge triggered by supply shocks and
administered price adjustments. However, inflationary pressures from strong domestic
demand and rising world food prices persist. Actions to contain fuel subsidies, wage
restraint, one-off receipts, and better cash management produced the lowest budget
deficit in years.

•

Structural reforms continued at an impressive pace: the fourth-largest state bank and a
large department store were privatized, tax administration was strengthened, and import
tariffs were reduced. Procedures for the registration of new businesses and of property, as
well as customs clearance, were streamlined.

Policy Issues
•

Economic policies are geared toward sustaining high growth and creating jobs for a
rapidly growing labor force. Reforms aim to enhance investment incentives by further
improving the business environment, while raising national savings and ensuring
domestic and external stability through continued fiscal adjustment.

•

The government plans to reduce the fiscal deficit gradually to 3 percent of GDP
by 2010/11 to bring public debt on a firmly declining path. This will require a reduction
in energy subsidies, containment of the wage bill, overhaul of the sales and property tax
regimes, and continued reform of the tax administration. Improvements in public
spending efficiency, including on social safety nets, will be equally critical to sustain
growth and strengthen the needed consensus for reforms, especially given the
disaffection of many groups with the lags in the “trickling down” of the benefits of
reform.

•

The recent move toward greater exchange rate flexibility needs to continue to better
support the conduct of a monetary policy aimed at fighting inflation and achieving short
term stabilization, in line with the authorities’ choice of a managed float regime. Staff
estimates indicate that the current account is consistent with external stability and the
exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals.

•

The authorities’ plans for further financial sector reforms are consistent with key
recommendations of the FSAP update. Continued effort is needed to improve bank and
nonbank supervision, complete the bank recapitalization program, enhance the
monitoring of state banks, and undertake complementary regulatory and judicial reforms

4
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Since last year’s Article IV consultation, Egypt’s economy has continued to grow
briskly, and inflation has moderated after a surge in 2006. While the reformist cabinet
continues to press ahead with policy and structural changes, opposition to reform has become
more vocal, fuelled in part by high food-price inflation and some frustration about the lag in
the “trickle down” of the benefits of growth.
2.
Egypt made significant progress on the issues raised in the 2006 consultation.
The authorities implemented a sizable fiscal adjustment, strengthened tax administration,
further liberalized the trade regime, and privatized financial and nonfinancial enterprises.
The exchange rate has become more flexible since July 2007.
3.
Discussions centered around achieving a macroeconomic policy mix that would
support higher growth and investment by ensuring domestic and external stability. The
policies discussed included (i) fiscal adjustment to raise national saving and ensure
sustainable public debt dynamics; (ii) greater exchange rate flexibility in line with the
authorities’ choice of a managed float and the planned move to inflation targeting in an
environment of large capital flows; (iii) a monetary policy stance that keeps inflation low
while accommodating supply shocks and administered price changes; (iv) and further
financial sector reform.
II. BACKGROUND AND DEVELOPMENTS1
4.
The broad-based economic expansion has created many jobs, public finances
have improved, and structural reforms have further liberalized the Egyptian economy.
•

The economy grew at 7 percent a year. Nonhydrocarbon growth surged from 5.8 percent
in 2005/06 to 7.1 percent in 2006/07, broadening to labor-intensive agriculture,
manufacturing, services, and construction. The spike in inflation was largely the result of
one-off factors, but demand pressures and imported inflation also played a role (Box 1).

•

The current growth spurt created about 2.5 million jobs between end-2004 and
March 2007, reducing unemployment from 11.8 percent to 9 percent.2 Skill mismatches
remain a hindrance to job growth, and formal sector employment is hindered by high
nonwage labor costs and expensive firing rules.

•

With surpluses in both the current and the financial accounts, the balance of payments
recorded another large surplus in FY 2006/07 (US$5.3 billion).

•

The central bank largely maintained through mid-2007 a de facto peg vis-à-vis the U.S.
dollar in the presence of strong appreciation pressures. Broad money growth surged after
April to 18 percent as less external inflows were sterilized and money market funds
deposited the proceeds from maturing central bank CDs with commercial banks. Annual
sterilization costs now approach 1 percent of GDP.

•

To rein in inflation, the authorities
raised policy rates in late 2006 but the
monetary transmission through interest
rates was weak. After initially rising
with policy rates, overnight and T-bill
rates fell, driven by foreign T-bill
demand and low budget financing
needs; bank lending rates barely
moved.4

balance, i.e., excluding one-off factors,
improved by about 2 percentage points of GDP, largely from wage restraint and savings
on subsidies, transfers, and interest payments due to cash and debt management reforms
(see text table). A significant increase in domestic fuel prices helped contain the fuel
subsidy bill.3

•

Structural reforms advanced significantly in promoting a private sector driven economy.

Domestic fuel prices were raised in July 2006 for diesel (increase of 25 percent), gasoline and natural gas (30
percent), and kerosene (88 percent).

¾ The weighted average import tariff (excluding alcoholic beverages) was reduced
from 9 to 6.9 percent in early 2007, and tax administration reforms
(modernization of tax and customs procedures, the merger of the income tax and
sales tax departments into a single tax authority, and the setting up of large and
medium tax-payer offices—the latter on a pilot basis) have progressed, with
substantial TA provided by FAD.
¾ Cash and debt management were streamlined by the consolidation of major
government accounts into a treasury single account (TSA) and by the settlement
of circular debts among the central government, the National Investment Bank,
and the Social Insurance Funds.
¾ In July 2007, Egypt successfully issued its first international local-currency bond
(LE 6 billion), seeking to widen the pool of investors and foster the establishment
of a meaningful benchmark yield curve.
¾ Plans to restructure the pension system with World Bank assistance are underway.
¾ The government is putting in place an institutional framework for private-public
partnerships (PPPs). A central monitoring unit was set up and legislation
providing a broad framework for concessions, PPPs, and leasing will soon be
submitted to parliament. PPP projects in the pipeline include building and
maintaining 2,100 public schools, four hospitals, several potable and waste water
stations, and two freeways. These projects are relatively small and would have
only a limited fiscal impact in the next few years.
¾ Recent steps to facilitate business activities included reducing the time, fees, and
minimum capital required to set up a business; sharply lowering fees for
registering property; and cutting further the time needed for imports and exports
to clear customs.

Box 1. What Explains Inflation Developments in 2006/07?
Egypt experienced a surge in inflation between March 2006 and March 2007 (see charts). Inflation began
to moderate after March 2007, with the CPI falling steadily to 8 percent (y-o-y) by July. The CPI rose
again to 8.5 percent in August largely because of an increase in food prices.
Supply shocks: An avian flu outbreak in February 2006 (resulting in the destruction of large chicken
stocks, quickly affecting meat and egg prices) and administered fuel price hikes in July 2006 (raising
prices for various fuels by 25 to 90 percent) had a sharp impact on prices, and headline inflation rose
until early 2007.
Higher world commodity prices: The surge in world prices for several commodities (the global food
price index increased by 10 percent in 2006) also contributed to inflation. Some imported food items
such as wheat, oils, and sugar are heavily subsidized by the government, but these constitute only about
3–4 percent of the CPI basket by weight compared to 40 percent for all food items. Prices of domestic
agricultural produce have also risen because of higher prices for imported fertilizer and seeds.

and unskilled labor is ample, there are
bottlenecks in some input markets—for example,
skilled labor and cement. More generally, as the Egyptian economy has been booming since early 2005,
it possibly went beyond one measure of potential output (estimated long-run trend GDP) in early 2006,
adding to inflationary pressures.

Egypt’s medium term prospects are favorable, provided the external environment
remains supportive, the government reduces the deficit by about 1 percent of GDP per year
as planned, and efforts continue to overcome structural constraints to business development.
•

Growth is projected to remain at 7–8 percent, assuming continued improvement in the
business environment succeeds in raising investment to levels over 25 percent of GDP,
while other reforms improve the quality of public expenditures (Table 4).

•

Foreign capital will play an increasing role in financing investment. Staff projects that
the current account will turn into a deficit of about 2 percent of GDP over the medium
term, to be financed largely by foreign direct investment (FDI) and a small increase in
borrowing.

•

The current account would remain close to norms derived from macroeconomic
fundamentals and the Egyptian pound broadly in line with fundamentals (see Box 2).

6.
The risks from external shocks are low, but a weakening of the reform effort
could harm investor confidence and growth:
•

The probability of a sudden stop of capital inflows is low. While Egypt has seen a
significant increase in capital inflows in the recent past, only a small part is portfolio
investment, while the rest is FDI. Geographically, the origin of the capital is also diverse
(mostly from Europe, the GCC, and the United States).

•

The vulnerability to a sudden stop is also low because the capital inflows have not
been intermediated through the financial system and official reserve levels are
comfortable. Stress tests conducted during the recent FSAP update suggest that the
banking system is mainly vulnerable to a deterioration in domestic credit quality,
whereas vulnerability to exchange or interest rate movements is low.

A weakening of the reform effort could threaten the bright medium-term outlook. The
positive investor view of the Egyptian economy is largely because of the economy’s
continuing liberalization since 2004, and in particular the willingness of the government to
place public debt on a sustainable path. Any dilution of the reform agenda (because of reform
fatigue or adverse political developments) could affect investment incentives and growth.
Without fiscal adjustment, growth would be lower and debt sustainability worse over the
medium term.

13
Box 2. Egypt’s Current Account and Equilibrium REER5
Egypt’s external current account (CA) has been in surplus (but on a declining trend) during the
past six years. The large downward correction of the nominal and real exchange rates during 2001–03
boosted competitiveness, the oil boom in the GCC region has increased remittances, and Egypt has
emerged as a major liquefied natural gas (LNG) exporter. At the same time, the improved availability of
foreign exchange and liberalization of trade facilitated a dramatic increase in non-oil merchandise
imports, from US$13 billion in FY03 to US$34 billion in FY07. Factoring in the full impact of the real
appreciation and reduction in import tariffs in recent years, the present underlying CA balance is
estimated to be in a range of 0 to -1 percent, compared to a projected surplus of 0.8 percent in 2007/08.
Using CGER-type methodologies, the external sustainability (ES) approach and the
macroeconomic balance (MB) approach indicate a range for the long-run equilibrium CA balance
(“norm”) of -½ to -2¼ percent of GDP, close to the underlying balance. Under the baseline scenario,
a CA balance of -0.8 percent of GDP would stabilize Egypt’s net foreign assets (NFA) at about
-9 percent of GDP, the 2005 level, while under the low growth scenario a CA deficit of 0.5 percent
would stabilize NFA. The MB approach, a panel-derived estimate of the CA as a function of a set of
macroeconomic fundamentals, indicates an equilibrium balance (“CA norm”) of about -1.7 to
-2.3 percent of GDP for Egypt, which would stabilize NFA at around -24 percent of GDP.
In the medium term, the CA is projected to turn into a deficit and remain close to the norms.
Strong reforms and a narrowing of the fiscal deficit in line with the authorities’ plans are expected to
result in continued strong growth and higher investment, and the CA balance is projected to move to
-2.2 percent of GDP over the next 5 years. If the fiscal deficit reverts back to 8–9 percent of GDP and
structural reforms lose momentum, growth and investment would moderate over time and the CA would
settle at around -1.0 percent of GDP. Under either scenario, external stability would be expected to be
maintained over the medium term.
Staff estimates suggest that the REER is broadly in line with fundamentals.
•

With the present underlying CA balance
within the range indicated by the various
norms, no REER adjustment is required
to ensure external stability.

Another staff exercise indicates the

existence of a long-run cointegrating

key fundamentals. Similar to results

found in the literature, the equilibrium
1975 1978 1981 1984 1987 1990 1993 1996 1999 2002 2005
REER was found to appreciate with a
strengthening of Egypt’s relative productivity (proxied by per capita GDP relative to trading
partners) and exogenous current account inflows (Suez canal fees, official and private remittances,
net oil exports, and tourism inflows), but depreciate with greater trade openness. Over the last 15
years, Egypt’s equilibrium REER has been on a declining trend mostly driven by relatively weak
productivity growth and more recently higher trade openness. The actual REER deviated at times
substantially from the estimated equilibrium REER, but by 2006, the gap had virtually closed.

See the Selected Issues Paper for greater detail.

IV. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Discussions focused on the authorities’ macroeconomic policy stance which is geared toward
sustaining high growth and creating jobs for a rapidly growing labor force.
A. Getting the Policy Mix Right
Fiscal policy
7.
Fiscal consolidation remains the overarching priority. It is key for raising national
savings to finance the higher investments needed. Given that net public debt is still high at
over 70 percent of GDP, it is also critical for consolidating domestic stability and reducing
any debt overhang effects on investment. Social expenditures are less efficient in improving
health, education, and poverty indicators than in many other countries.6 In particular, food
and fuel subsidies remain high, at about 7 percent of GDP. The under-pricing of energy
promotes excessive consumption with high environmental costs and has little impact on
poverty,7 while attracting investment into sectors where Egypt may not have a long-run
comparative advantage, and implies high effective rates of protection in energy-intensive
industries.
8.
The authorities are committed to reduce the fiscal deficit to 3 percent of GDP
by 2010/11, which would put debt dynamics on a sustainable path and create space for
private sector-led growth (see Table 8 and Figure 3). Planned adjustment measures
include further energy subsidy reductions, including the phasing out, over 3 years, of gas and
electricity subsidies to energy-intensive industrial users; containment of wage bill growth,
among other things by a partial hiring freeze; sales tax reforms aimed at moving to a fullfledged value-added tax (VAT)—by widening coverage to services, unifying rates, and
raising the exemption threshold; and continued improvements in tax administration. In line
with this strategy, the 2007/08 central government budget aims to contain the deficit at
7 percent of GDP, implying an underlying adjustment of more than 1 percent of GDP
(Table 2). Such fiscal consolidation would also support monetary policy in reducing demand
pressures and contain speculative inflows. The rapid introduction of the sales tax reform and
of the planned energy subsidy cuts will be critical to achieve the target.
Monetary and exchange rate policy
9.
The exchange rate is not misaligned, but the de facto peg in place through mid2007 has complicated the task of short-term stabilization. Staff discussed recent estimates
that indicate that the rate is boadly in line with fundamentals (see Box 2). However, staff
underscored the complications arising from attempts to target both inflation and the exchange
rate, especially given Egypt’s growing integration in global capital markets. The authorities
in this context concurred that capital controls would be an ineffective and costly approach to
dealing with short-term inflows.

15
10.
The authorities’ reaffirmed their commitment to a managed float and an
eventual inflation targeting regime. They agreed that allowing greater flexibility need not
preclude the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) from smoothing volatility from one-off flows, but
might help to discourage speculative inflows by forcing investors to internalize exchange rate
risk. They shared concerns about high sterilization costs and noted staff views that any
modest appreciation should help dampen inflation and would be unlikely to affect the
competitiveness of Egyptian exports, especially because of the sharp nominal depreciation
vis-à-vis the euro since end-2005 (Europe is the main export destination). The CBE pointed
to the increased volatility of the exchange rate since July 2007 as evidence of a move away
from the de facto peg.
11.
The CBE intends to pursue its current approach of broadly targeting underlying
inflation. The CBE has been working on constructing “core inflation” measures, which
exclude the most volatile food items as well as items subject to administered prices, and
would constitute a useful gauge of underlying inflation. The authorities believed that their
publication would greatly enhance communication of the CBE’s policy to the public, but
plan to wait for the new CPI data to become available. Staff shares the authorities’
expectation that in the near term underlying inflation will remain in single digits, provided
monetary policy remains vigilant. Should the recent surge in broad money prove less
temporary than thought, and the recent appreciation insufficient to curb inflationary
pressures, some further tightening might be required.
12.
Despite rising rapidly last year, Egypt’s reserves remain broadly in line with
other emerging market peers (Figure 2). However, they do carry rising costs (including
sterilization costs). The authorities see the recent high reserve accumulation largely as a
response to one-off inflows, providing the opportunity to build a cushion against external
vulnerabilities, largely achieved by now. There is a risk that the CBE’s placement of foreign
exchange with commercial banks could fuel growth in dollar-denominated bank credits.
However, the authorities observed that the risk of a dollar-denominated credit boom is low as
commercial banks have deposited most CBE foreign currency placements overseas and
domestic foreign currency borrowing is open only to clients engaging in external trade
transactions. They plan to carefully monitor commercial banks’ use of the CBE’s foreign
exchange placements.
B. Financial Sector Reforms for Growth and Stability
13.
Having progressed well on bank reforms, the authorities are expanding their
reform agenda to other parts of the financial system. Recent reforms (see Box 3) have
revitalized bank lending to both households and corporates. In addition to the planned
privatization of Banque du Caire, the authorities are also focusing on the stock market and

16
Box 3. The 2007 Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) Update
A joint IMF-World Bank mission updated in May 2007 the 2002 FSAP. The mission found that
substantial progress was made since the launch of the government’s 2004 financial sector reform
program especially in building a more efficient banking system, but that major challenges remain—
notably in modernizing supervision and dealing with substantial public ownership.
Progress since the 2002 FSAP
The transformation of the Egyptian financial sector has been underway since the authorities began
implementing the comprehensive reform program; most of the recommendations of the 2002 FSAP are
being implemented.
•

Banking reforms include a new banking law, the exit of several weak banks, large-scale
financial restructuring involving the buy-out and provisioning of nonperforming loans, the
divestiture of state shares in joint venture banks (about 17 percent of banking assets),
significantly enhanced banking supervision, and the privatization of one major public bank
(Bank of Alexandria, 5 percent of banking assets). As a result, the private sector now owns the
majority of banking assets.

•

Reforms in money and foreign exchange markets include the 2004 unification of the various
exchange rates, the removal of several nonmarket restrictions, and further development of
capital markets, which have grown significantly as a result of privatization, regulatory reform,
and foreign interest in equity markets.

Completing Financial Reforms
To ensure the financial sector contributes to sustainable growth of the economy, the next round of reform
should further strengthen bank supervision, develop the nonbank sector, and diversify the financial
system. In particular, it is necessary to
•

improve bank supervision data and analysis; continue to move from compliance-based to riskbased supervision practices; and address, in due course, the potential conflicts of interest in the
transitional arrangements for the composition of the CBE’s board and the accumulation of
management and supervisory functions;

•

assign remaining state banks monitorable goals and performance contracts, and reconsider the
role of the three small specialized state banks, leading to possible consolidation;

•

further improve the collateral regime by expanding the admissible types of securities and better
enforcing the new foreclosure rules;

•

reduce surplus liquidity in the foreign exchange and money markets and remove the end-of-day
foreign exchange clearing facility to allow greater market determination of the exchange rate in
line with the de jure float;

•

further enhance private equity and establish corporate fixed income markets, including by
addressing outstanding regulatory issues such as cumbersome legal procedures that hamper
corporate bond issuance, further privatizations that include public IPOs, strengthening the stock
exchange’s role by clarifying its ownership and governance structure, and building an
institutional investor base;

•

restructure and at least partially privatize state insurers, enact key sector legislation (including
on mandatory third party liability insurance, and allowing market-based premia), and move
further toward risk-based regulation and supervision.

•

ensure a smooth integration of nonbank supervisory agencies, aimed at establishing a common
risk-based approach harmonizing governance, staff skills, and supervisory focus.

17
the nonbank financial sector (mortgage, insurance, public and private pension system) with a
view to enhance financial intermediation, attract savings, and finance economic growth.
While past stock market capitalization gains have mainly come from price effects (as
opposed to initial public offerings), the authorities pointed to the growing role of private
placements.
14.
The authorities plan to complete in the near future the 2004 financial sector
reform program, in line with some of the FSAP recommendations.
•

On restructuring of state banks, they have largely cleaned up Banque du Caire’s
nonperforming loan portfolio and its sale is expected to be completed by mid-2008.

•

A new credit bureau began operations in July and is expected to expand its database
further, significantly enhancing banks’ information set in consumer lending.

•

To enhance the role of equity markets in mobilizing corporate finance, the listing process
is being simplified and the delisting of little-traded companies accelerated. Plans are
underway to establish a small-cap exchange.

•

In insurance, the viable state insurance companies—that still dominate both life and
nonlife insurance markets as well as reinsurance—are being merged to form a “national
champion”—the largest insurer in the Middle East. Later, there may be a partial float of
shares to enhance market discipline.

15.
The authorities expressed concerns about implementing some recommendations
of the FSAP update. On the transition to risk-based bank supervision, the authorities felt the
FSAP assessment did not adequately acknowledge progress achieved in upgrading
regulations and staff skills. On the management of remaining state banks, the CBE
emphasized the importance of proper supervision but did not see a need for performance
contracts.
C. Other Issues
16.
Further improvements in macroeconomic statistics are needed. Egypt subscribed
to the SDDS in January 2005, but data deficiencies persist in many sectors. The mission
urged the authorities to implement the recommendations made in the 2003 data ROSC and
improve the overall production of statistics (Appendix III), attaching particular urgency to
timely and accurate data on the oil and gas sector. Progress in implementing a comprehensive
foreign investment survey needs to speed up.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
17.
Egypt’s economy delivered another impressive performance in 2006/07. Farreaching reforms since 2004 and solid macroeconomic management supported by a favorable
global and regional economic environment are paying off as the economy experiences its
highest growth in years, with substantial gains in employment. A temporary run-up in

18
inflation was partly the result of overdue fuel-price adjustments. While monetary policy
rightly focused on containing spillovers from administered price increases, the effectiveness
of policy implementation was hampered by insufficient exchange rate flexibility. The de
facto peg has also contributed to rising sterilization costs and to the import of global food
price inflation into Egypt, which has triggered increasingly vocal popular concerns that may
complicate future reforms. In staff’s view, the experience of the last 3 years provides some
important lessons that should guide policies going forward.
18.
Reforms have paid off, and continuing the government’s reform agenda is
essential to further reduce high unemployment and sustain high growth. Building on the
impressive gains made since 2004, this will require domestic and external stability anchored
by a consistent macroeconomic policy framework, fiscal adjustment, and legal and regulatory
reform that reduce red tape and facilitate contract enforcement.
19.
The government’s plan to reduce the deficit gradually to 3 percent of GDP
by 2010/11 is appropriately ambitious and would put public debt on a firmly declining
path. In line with this strategy, meeting the 2007/08 central government deficit target of
7 percent of GDP will be important. Achieving the short and medium-term fiscal targets will
require policy measures such as forceful reductions in energy subsidies, continued
retrenchment in the wage bill, reform of the sales and property taxes, and improvements in
the efficiency of cash management and public spending. In particular, the planned phase-out
of gas and electricity subsidies for energy intensive industries, if implemented quickly,
would contribute sizably toward meeting the medium-term targets. While staff sees
considerable scope for delivering better public services in all social areas, energy subsidies
constitute the most glaring example of unproductive public spending and offer ample room
for reducing spending. At the same time, efforts should continue to strengthen social safety
nets to protect the poorest segments of society. PPPs should be introduced gradually to
minimize risks and allow learning from experience.
20.
In staff’s view, the favorable economic environment provides an opportunity to
put the crucial supporting fiscal measures in place early on both to help deliver
the 2007/08 budget target and to enhance the credibility of the reform program, thereby
contributing to a strong and swift investor response. Many of these measures are politically
difficult, and building the necessary consensus, including through transparent
communication, will be important. But the continued increases in international food and fuel
prices, which will drive up the food and subsidy bill, has made strong and timely action even
more pressing.
21.
Staff concurs that the authorities' choice of a managed float regime is an
appropriate framework to deliver macroeconomic stability. A flexible rate acts as a
natural stabilizer in dealing with real shocks, including capital flows—relevant features of
the Egyptian economy. Furthermore, Egypt has the institutions and capacity to implement an
independent monetary policy, and owing to prudential regulations and limited dollarization,
the balance sheets of neither the banking nor the corporate or household sectors appear
particularly vulnerable to currency swings.

19
22.
Staff estimates that the Egyptian real exchange rate is broadly in line with
fundamentals. The recently observed greater flexibility of the exchange rate is a welcome
step toward a more consistent policy framework based on a managed float, consistent with
the planned move to inflation targeting. Greater exchange rate flexibility is essential to make
monetary policy an effective tool for liquidity management, eliminate the one-way bet on the
currency, and lower sterilization costs. The central bank will need to continue to focus on
and respond to developments in available measures of underlying inflation.
23.
Staff strongly supports the authorities’ plans to move ahead with further
financial sector reforms, consistent with recent FSAP recommendations. Over the last two
years, privatization has put about half of the banking sector into private hands and resolution
of NPLs has advanced well. Staff encourages the authorities to build on the good progress
made to date, and continue to improve bank and nonbank supervision along the lines set out
in the banking sector program launched in 2004 and the recent FSAP update. With a
predominantly private banking sector, it will be crucial to impose stringent performance
standards on remaining state-owned banks and improve monitoring to prevent these banks
from defending market shares by taking on higher risks. Complementary regulatory and
judicial reforms—such as setting up specialized economic courts and enhancing the role of
the private sector-led credit bureau—will also help to improve contract enforcement and
creditor protection, thereby addressing key obstacles to bank lending to small and medium
enterprises (SMEs). Given the experience with public ownership, staff is skeptical about the
idea of building a largely state-owned “national champion” in the insurance sector and
believes that it should be gradually privatized.
24.
Economic and financial statistics provided to the Fund are broadly adequate for
surveillance, but efforts to improve macroeconomic statistics need to continue. Egypt
subscribed to the SDDS in January 2005, but data improvements in certain areas are urgently
needed. A new CPI series has been published, but greater details on the underlying
methodology would be helpful. Progress in implementing a comprehensive foreign
investment survey has been slow. Data availability on the production and use of oil and gas
needs to be improved, and greater transparency of EGPC’s financial situation would help in
the rationalization of energy policy. Staff encourages the authorities to implement the
recommendations made in the 2003 data ROSC.
25.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with the Arab Republic of Egypt
take place on the 12-month cycle.

1/ Includes multilateral and bilateral public sector borrowing and private borrowing.
2/ Data before 2004/05 are the CBE data on non-oil FDI augmented by estimates of FDI in the oil and gas sector derived from EGPC annual reports.
3/ In addition to the revisions to the FDI data (see footnote 2), IMF staff make four other adjustments to the official balance of payments data. First, the CBE
estimates record the difference between a headcount-based estimate of tourism-related inflows and the estimates obtained from the International Transactions
Recording System as an outflow in the capital account. The staff estimates here record only the flows based on direct estimates of tourists arrivals with the errors
and omissions line offsetting any upward bias implicit in these estimates. Second, because of large discrepancies between the annual flows of net short-term
suppliers credits and changes in end-of-period stocks in the official data, net flows of short-term suppliers credits are not identified here and are instead absorbed
in errors and omissions. Third, unlike in the official data and in order to preserve symmetry with unrecorded capital outflows on account of currency substitution in
earlier years, reverse currency substitution in 2004/05 is not recorded under other capital inflows, but reflected in errors and omissions instead. Fourth, unlike the
official data, changes in nonresident holdings of domestic currency-denominated treasury bills are recorded under portfolio investment (US$2.9 billion in 2005/06 an
4/ The official data on external debt do not include nonresident holdings of domestic currency-denominated treasury bills (about US$8.1 billion at end-June 2007).

1/ Refers to the general government, including government guaranteed debt.
2/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; a = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of US dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

(e > 0) and a rising GDP deflator.
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both noninterest current account and nondebt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and nondebt inflows in percent of GDP)
remain at their levels of the last projection year.

Egypt accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 on January 2, 2005.

The projection of charges and interest assume that overdue principal at the report date (if any) will remain
outstanding, but forthcoming obligations will be settled on time.

VII.

Exchange Rate Arrangement (As of October 31, 2007):

Prior to January 29, 2003, the Egyptian pound was pegged to the dollar, with all foreign
exchange transactions taking place within a ±3 percent range around the central rate, which
was announced by the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE). Effective January 29, 2003, the
Egyptian pound was allowed to float. As a result, the exchange arrangement of Egypt was
reclassified to the category “managed float with no pre-announced path for the exchange
rate,” from the category “pegged exchange rate within horizontal bands.” In December 2004,
the CBE officially launched the foreign exchange interbank market with no controls on rates,
governed by a formal interbank convention on foreign exchange trading. The CBE stands
ready to purchase foreign exchange in the interbank market for banks to the extent they
exceed prudential limits on net open positions at the prevailing market rate. Effective
February 1, 2005, Egypt’s exchange rate was reclassified to a conventional peg from a
managed float with no predetermined path for the exchange rate. Since July 2007, the de
facto exchange arrangement has been akin to a managed float. Egypt maintains a bilateral
payment arrangement with Sudan which has been inoperative since the late 1990s.

Article IV Consultation:

Consultations with Egypt are on a 12-month cycle. The last Article IV consultation
discussions were held in Cairo from April 3-16, 2006. The staff report (CR/06/253) was
discussed by the Executive Board on July 5, 2006. The 2006 Article IV report, and PIN were
published on July 11, 2006.

Egypt: Relations with the World Bank
1.
Partnership for Development. Key development objectives of the government of
Egypt as expressed in its development plan are to achieve high and sustainable growth by
enhancing the role of the private sector in the development process; focusing the public
sector on delivering public goods; and strengthening the social safety net system. Within the
context of a lending program (outlined in the Country Assistance Strategy of FY2002-2004)
which was modest in relation to the size and importance of the country, the Bank assisted the
Government in addressing its development challenges. During that Country Assistance
Strategy period, the Bank and the Government also collaborated on several pieces of
analytical work that led to both a better and a shared understanding in such areas as poverty
trends, gender achievements and education sector needs. The spirit that marked this
collaborative effort bodes well for the future as the shared understanding feeds into policy
and project design as well as leads to faster implementation of Bank interventions.
2.
World Bank Country Assistance Strategy. The current Bank assistance is
anchored in a Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for the period FY2006–FY2009, which the
Bank’s Board of Directors endorsed on June 16, 2005. In line with the Government’s
development and reform agenda, the CAS identified and implements interventions that will
facilitate private sector development, enhance the provision of public services, and promote
equity.
3.
IMF-World Bank Collaboration in Specific Areas. The Bank and IMF continues
to collaborate efforts in supporting the Government in the areas of macro-economic
framework and management; budget and public expenditure management; public sector
reform; and private and financial sector development.

World Bank/IDA Portfolio
4.
As of September 30, 2007, the Bank approved for Egypt 116 projects valued at about
$6.3 billion (excluding grants and cancellations) of which about $5.5 billion have been
disbursed. The current portfolio has 15 active projects with commitment value of about
US$1.3 billion and an undisbursed balance of about US$841.5 million. The sectoral
composition of these 15 projects (by value) is as follows: 53 percent for infrastructure,
3 percent for financial sector, 28 percent for agriculture, and 16 percent for social sector.
International Finance Corporation (IFC) Investments
5.
As of September 30, 2007, IFC's total committed portfolio was $409 million for 34
projects for its own account. The portfolio is diversified and includes investments in the
financial sector, power, export-oriented manufacturing, ports, oil and gas, metals,
agribusiness, mining, IT, and health care. In FY07, IFC committed US$310 million in
Egypt, more than triple the FY06 commitments of US$81 million. IFC's investment work in
Egypt has been strongly supported by the Public Enterprise Partnership (PEP-MENA)
advisory work in the areas of business start-up simplification, SME access to finance and
management training, microfinance, corporate governance, and training of women
entrepreneurs. Cairo is the regional HQ of IFC’s MENA Department and is the hub for
IFC’s investment activity in eight Middle East countries of the MENA Region.
Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) Exposures
6.
MIGA's portfolio in Egypt, as a host country, consists of one project, sponsored by a
Spanish investor, in the waste management sector. Earlier, there were two claims, filed by
the investor with regard to the project, which have since been resolved. The outstanding
gross exposure from this investment stands at $6.4 million. As an investor country, MIGA is
currently sponsoring an Egyptian investor in support of two telecom projects in Pakistan and
Bangladesh, with a combined gross exposure of US$ 152.2 million. As of the first quarter of
FY08, MIGA has not received any requests to provide coverage of projects in support of
development in Egypt.

Appendix III. Egypt: Statistical Issues
1.
National accounts. National accounts data are compiled on an annual fiscal year
basis and a quarterly basis by the National Accounts Department within the Ministry of
Planning in current and constant prices, using the 1993 System of National Accounts
(SNA 1993). The data have a number of shortcomings, including inconsistencies with the
balance of payments and the absence of a reliable series on GDP and its uses, at constant
prices (the base year is often changed without an overlap for the series with different
base). Shortcomings in terms of annual and quarterly data timeliness, reliability, and
availability weaken the accurate and timely analysis of economic developments. There
are discrepancies between quarterly and annual GDP figures. The October 2003 data
ROSC mission found that there is scope for improving national accounts statistics,
including the need for a more critical review of source statistics. There are no periodic
user surveys or an oversight body to provide guidance on the quality of national
accounts.
2.
Price and labor market statistics. An updated CPI with new weights according
to the 1999–2000 household expenditure survey was first published in April 2004. The
2003 ROSC found that various constraints, including computer resources, curtailed much
needed innovations in the CPI, and the index may not have been adequately accurate.
Price statistics were revised without providing an explanation in August 2005. The
Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics (CAPMAS) plans to release a new
Consumer Price Index (CPI), referenced to January 2007, in late 2007. The new CPI
weights will be based on consumer spending in 2004/2005. It will reflect new methods
that include a modified formulation that allows new items to be more easily introduced
into the index and aggregation of regional indices based on expenditure, as opposed to
population shares. There remains a need to expand the sample of outlets from which
prices are collected. The authorities are currently involved in projects to improve the
sampling of outlets for the CPI and to complete development of the PPI with technical
assistance from METAC in close cooperation with the STA. These actions are
complemented by a training program in price statistics to be delivered by the U.S. Bureau
of Labor Statistics. There are plans to improve the external trade price indices (the latter
are unreliable and available only annually).
3.
Balance of Payments (BOP) statistics. BOP statistics are compiled and
disseminated by the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) in accordance with the BMP5. The
2003 data ROSC mission noted that balance of payments statistics face problems with
source data. Because merchandise trade statistics based on customs declarations have
serious problems, compilers have to rely on banks’ foreign exchange records to estimate
exports and imports of goods. However, the coverage and classification of foreign
exchange transactions are declining following exchange liberalization. Source data do not
reasonably approximate accrual basis. Another key shortcoming is the lack of survey data
for direct investment enterprises.
4.
Foreign Direct Investment. A METAC mission in March 2005 provided
technical assistance in measuring foreign direct investment (FDI) to the CBE, the

8
Ministry of Investment (MOI), and the General Administration for Investment and Free
Zones (GAFI). The METAC expert made several recommendations, including proposing
a benchmark FDI survey to collect data on the stocks and flows associated with FDI.
Further, based on discussions with the CBE, MOI, GAFI, CAPMAS, the Ministry of
Petroleum, the Capital Market Authority, and the American Chamber of Commerce,
recommendations were made to the CBE to revise the balance of payments data related to
direct investment, services receipts, income payments, other foreign investments in
Egypt, and other sectors’ assets abroad. These recommendations were consistent with the
ROSC recommendations. Subsequently, the CBE incorporated petroleum investment data
into the balance of payments for the third and fourth quarters of 2004 and first quarter
of 2005.
5.
In 2006 two METAC missions provided further technical assistance on the
compilation of FDI statistics, particularly in survey design, sampling, and constructing a
business register. In consultation with the Joint Committee on FDI statistics, a work plan
was drawn up. A subsequent METAC mission on FDI is planned for the fall of 2007,
depending on the progress made by the authorities.
6.
External debt and the international investment position (IIP). In September
2006 STA provided a seminar on IIP statistics and workshop sessions were held with the
compilers to prepare IIP in the required international format for publication by STA (IIP
data for Egypt are now disseminated through the IFS and BOPSY). The mission identified
gaps in the data and inconsistencies between flows and stock data and the authorities
agreed to work on closing the gaps, to the extent possible. The mission also encouraged
the authorities to submit the reserves template to STA for posting on the Fund’s external
website and consultations are ongoing through the Senior Resident Representative.
7.
Data on external debt meets SDDS requirements. The authorities are drawing on
advice from Fund staff and other outside advisers to design a strategy for strengthening
the reporting system on non-guaranteed debt.
8.
Fiscal data. The authorities are in the process of adopting a new budget
classification (NBC) based on the GFSM 2001, with FAD and STA advice, and several
of the requirements of the GFSM 2001 have already been met. Nonetheless, the
consolidation of general government operations (budget sector, National Investment
Bank, and Social Insurance Funds) under this new classification has not been finalized,
and has been fully applied only to “above-the-line” transactions. Annual data were
recently reported using the GFSM 2001 methodology―on a cash-basis―for the
Government Finance Statistics (GFS) Yearbook for the fiscal years 2003-2007. No data
are reported for publication in the International Financial Statistics (IFS). The
presentation of the fiscal data used to meet the SDDS requirements for general
government operations and central government operations―on a cash basis―largely
conforms to the GFSM 2001 methodology (see Egypt’s National Summary Data Page at
http://www.mop.gov.eg/MOP_META/nsdp.htm).

9
9.
Monetary statistics. The statistics are comprehensive and reported regularly. The
data ROSC for Egypt raised the issue of potential overstatement of foreign assets and
foreign liabilities of the banking sector, as recorded in the monetary statistics, because an
offshore bank located in Egypt is erroneously treated as a nonresident entity. Egypt is
reporting monetary data to STA using the Standardized Report Forms.
10.
Data dissemination. Egypt subscribed to the SDDS in January 2005. Remaining
issues include the timeliness of the labor market data on employment and unemployment,
and the timeliness and periodicity of the labor market data for wages/earnings and data
for central government operations.
11.
Data ROSC. A data ROSC report, based on an October 2003 mission, assessing
the quality of Egypt’s macroeconomic statistics and recommending improvements was
published in July 2005.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
November 28, 2007
1.
The following information has become available since the issuance of the staff report
on November 2, 2007. It does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Inflation—as measured by the old CPI—moderated to 6.9 percent in October (yearon-year basis) after rising slightly in September to 8.8 percent. Since September, the
authorities have also published a new CPI series with updated weights of the consumption
basket. This series covers observations available since January 2007 and involves a greater
weight of food in the basket (a revision in weight from 39 to 44 percent). Under the new
series, monthly CPI inflation in September and October was 2.1 percent and 1.0 percent,
respectively (compared to 1.4 percent and 0.9 percent under the old series).
3.
Balance of payments data for the July–September 2007 period show a somewhat
larger deterioration in the current account (by US$1.5 billion, compared to July–September
2006) than projected by staff (US$1 billion), largely because of higher than anticipated
service payments for transportation and travel. Non-oil exports expanded by 20 percent, but
oil exports fell sharply. The decline in the current account balance was more than offset by
higher FDI inflows, including in the oil sector.
4.
The growth of monetary aggregates moderated somewhat, reflecting some capital
outflow in September—following the global credit crunch—and stepped-up sterilization in
October. The year-on-year increase in reserve money decelerated to 14 percent in October
(from 18 percent in September), while broad money growth in September was 17 percent
(down from 18 percent in August).
5.
The authorities have issued a government decree raising gas and electricity prices for
large industrial consumers (except those in the food processing and textiles industries). Gas
prices will more than double and electricity prices will increase by about 60 percent over a
three year period. Preliminary estimates indicate that these measures could yield over
1 percent of GDP in annual savings by 2009/10.
Preliminary fiscal data for the first quarter of fiscal year 2007/08 suggest buoyant
revenues after adjusting for one-off factors, and expenditure growth broadly in line with
seasonal patterns. The recently enacted energy price adjustment for industrial users should
help reach this year's budget target.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
December 3, 2007

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with
the Arab Republic of Egypt
On November 28, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with the Arab Republic of Egypt.9
Background
Sustained and bold reforms, prudent macroeconomic management, and a favorable
external environment enabled the Egyptian economy to register another year of impressive
performance. Growth remained high and has become more broad-based, creating record
numbers of jobs. Inflation has returned to single digits after spiking during the year through
March 2007. Investor confidence remains high.
Real GDP growth in 2006/07 is estimated at 7.1 percent, the highest in years. The
expansion was broad-based, with a further acceleration in non-hydrocarbon sectors,
including in agriculture and manufacturing. The growth since end-2004 has added
2.4 million jobs as of end-March 2007, reducing unemployment from 10.5 percent to 9
percent.
Strong growth and rising equity and real estate prices have boosted domestic demand,
contributing to strong import growth and a pick-up in underlying inflation. Exports also rose
sharply, along with worker remittances, Suez canal receipts, and tourism revenues. With
record levels of FDI, the balance of payments recorded a surplus of US$5.3 billion in
2006/07, bringing official reserves to the equivalent of more than 6 months of imports of
goods and services. A spike in inflation over the year through March 2007 was driven largely
by the impact of an avian flu outbreak and adjustments in administered fuel prices in 2006;
9

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return
to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive
Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board,
summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's
authorities.

2
but a rise in underlying inflation (one that excludes food and most energy prices) points to
some spillovers and demand pressures as well, along with some imported inflation. After
peaking at 12.8 percent in March 2007, CPI inflation has gradually receded since, to
8.5 percent in August; underlying inflation has also fallen substantially.
Macroeconomic policies in 2006/07 helped contain demand and inflationary pressures, but
were complicated by strong capital inflows. Monetary policy was tightened once spillover
effects of administered price increases became visible, and the nominal exchange rate
allowed to appreciate by 1.1 percent against the U.S. dollar in the year to end-June, with
considerably greater flexibility since then. Through the partial sterilization of external inflows,
broad money growth was kept in the 13–15 percent range until April 2007, but subsequently
surged to 18 percent.
Fiscal imbalances narrowed as there was significant underlying adjustment in 2006/07.
Preliminary data indicate a central government deficit of 7.5 percent of GDP, below the
9 percent average of recent years, largely due to structural improvements in the tax area,
fuel price adjustments, wage restraint, and windfall receipts from a telecom license sale,
with a broadly similar adjustment for the general government (which includes social security
funds and the National Investment Bank, NIB). Combined with privatization receipts and the
draw-down of idle cash balances following the consolidation of most government accounts
into a Treasury Single Account (TSA), budget borrowing requirements fell dramatically,
contributing to a decline in T-bill yields.
Structural reforms advanced significantly in promoting a private sector driven economy. The
fourth largest state bank (Bank of Alexandria) and a large department store chain along with
other assets were sold to foreign investors (about 1.4 percent of GDP). Import tariffs were
reduced in early 2007, and tax administration reforms progressed. Cash and debt
management was streamlined by consolidating government accounts into a treasury single
account and by the settlement of circular debts among the central government, the NIB and
the Social Insurance Funds. Plans are afoot to restructure the pension system with
assistance from the World Bank and the government is putting in place a strong institutional
framework for PPPs. Egypt successfully issued its first international local-currency bond
(LE 6 billion), seeking to widen the investor pool, foster secondary trading and hence
establish a meaningful benchmark yield curve.
Recent steps undertaken to facilitate business activities include slashing the time, fees, and
minimum capital required to set up a business; drastically lowering fees for registering
property; and cutting further the time needed for imports and exports to clear customs.
Egypt’s macroeconomic vulnerabilities seem low. The diversified sources of foreign capital
(mostly from Europe, the GCC countries and North America) and a still-low share of
speculative funds limit the risk of a sudden reversal of capital flows. The vulnerability to any
reversal is furthermore limited as little of these inflows have been intermediated through the
banking system and the CBE’s international reserves are high. Stress testing conducted
during the recent joint World Bank/IMF Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP)
Update highlights that the banking system would be vulnerable mainly to a deterioration of

3
domestic credit quality and much less to exchange and interest rate movements. To date
Egypt has weathered the recent turbulences in global financial markets rather well, some
pullback in the stock and fixed-income markets notwithstanding.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Egyptian authorities’ sound macroeconomic
management and bold economic reforms. Fiscal adjustment and significant achievements in
privatization and financial sector reform have increased market confidence and boosted
investment, thereby helping to sustain a high pace of economic growth. Growth is
increasingly broad-based, contributing to a substantial reduction in unemployment.
Looking ahead, Directors observed that important challenges remain. They pointed, in
particular, to the high government budget deficit, shallow financial intermediation, and
remaining bureaucratic barriers to private sector activity. Furthermore, domestic demand
continues to contribute to the inflationary pressures. Directors also cautioned that the slow
trickle-down of the benefits of economic growth could weaken public support for the reform
effort.
Against this background, Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to reduce the
fiscal deficit to 3 percent of GDP by fiscal year 2010/11. This will help further increase
investor confidence, further improve the economy’s resilience to exogenous shocks, reduce
the public debt, and underpin macroeconomic stability. In this context, Directors
commended the fiscal adjustment achieved last year, including through the reform of tax
administration and public finance management and the reduction of fuel subsidies. They
welcomed the planned further reduction of fuel subsidies, and called for stronger social
safety nets to protect vulnerable segments of the population, as well as more efficient and
better prioritized social spending. Directors looked forward to quick progress on the value
added tax reform, containment of the wage bill, and further broadening of the tax base.
Directors commended the efforts of the central bank to strengthen monetary policy
formulation and improve the interest rate transmission mechanism. They generally
supported the central bank’s pragmatic approach of focusing on underlying inflation to
forestall second-round effects of administered price increases and supply shocks. Directors
cautioned that, going forward, monetary policy will need to be vigilant in light of continued
demand pressures. They welcomed the planned adoption of inflation targeting, which should
be introduced after steps are taken to ensure a competitive banking system and a consistent
monetary policy framework.
Directors welcomed the move to greater exchange rate flexibility since mid-2007, which has
enhanced the coherence of the macroeconomic policy mix. The ensuing exchange rate
appreciation has helped in curbing inflation. Directors considered that allowing a greater role
for market forces in determining the exchange rate would help to deal with pressures arising
from capital inflows and to underpin the move to inflation targeting. They agreed that Egypt’s
current account is consistent with external stability, and that the exchange rate is broadly in
line with economic fundamentals.

4

Directors commended the significant progress in financial sector reform, and welcomed the
authorities’ plans for further reform in line with key recommendations of the recent FSAP
update. They welcomed the successful sale of a major state-owned bank and the efforts to
reduce the nonperforming loans in the banking system. They encouraged completion of the
privatization of another bank in 2008 as planned. Directors emphasized the importance of
improving supervision, completing bank recapitalization, enhancing the monitoring of state
banks, and undertaking complementary regulatory and judicial reforms. Some Directors
called for gradual privatization of the large state-owned insurance company, in line with the
authorities’ overall thrust toward greater private sector participation in the financial sector.
Directors stressed that enhancing the investment climate will be crucial to sustain the growth
momentum. They welcomed the ongoing efforts to reduce barriers to private sector activity,
including through lower import tariffs, reduction of red tape, and a strengthened legal
framework for business activities. They also pointed out that a faster pace of job creation will
require labor market reforms and education to reduce skill mismatches, non-wage costs,
and constraints on hiring and firing.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by A. Shakour Shaalan, Executive Director for the Arab Republic of Egypt
November 28, 2007
Recent Developments
1.
On recent occasions in Board discussions of Egypt’s Article IV consultations, I have
emphasized the authorities’ commitment to the bold and comprehensive set of economic
reforms which were introduced in mid-2004. The momentum of these far-reaching economic
reforms has continued well into 2007, and its dividends, as was the case last year, continue to
pay off. The pace of the fiscal consolidation agenda has been adhered to, underpinned by
important fuel subsidy and tax administration reforms. Structural reforms accelerated, with
the privatization of Egypt’s fourth largest bank and a large department store, further
reductions in tariff rates, and important measures to improve the business climate and
stimulate private sector activity. The monetary policy framework continues to be
strengthened, building up toward an inflation targeting regime in the medium term. Progress
on key prerequisites for inflation targeting has allowed the introduction of greater exchange
rate flexibility since mid-2007, consistent with the authorities’ managed float exchange
regime, which I should add is not a pegged rate as inadvertently implied by the staff in
paragraph 9 of the staff report. They would have been right if they were referring to the past.
2.
Against this background, growth surged in 2005/06 and accelerated further
in 2006/07 to over 7 percent, driven by a significant expansion of non-oil activity, and
generating close to 2.5 million jobs since end-2004. As has been the case in other dynamic
economies, inflation picked up somewhat in 2006/07, but is projected to ease significantly as
the pressures from exogenous supply shocks and fuel price increases dissipate. The
expansion was supported by a strong external sector, as non-oil exports picked up
appreciably, FDI flows registered record peaks, mostly in greenfield investments, and the
reserve position strengthened further to US$31 billion in October 2007. Building on
strengthened investor sentiment and several ratings upgrades, Egypt’s first international
local-currency bond in the amount of LE 6 billion was very well received by the market,
setting an encouraging benchmark for a second issuance that is currently being contemplated.
I should mention two important pieces of statistics that attest to Egypt’s radically improved
economic environment. As shown in Table 1 of the staff report, gross national savings
increased by about 2.5 percent in the four years to 2007/08 and for the same period capital
investment increased by over 6 percent, setting the pace for a brighter outlook.
Outlook and Policies
3.
The authorities share staff’s assessment regarding the strength of the medium-term
outlook. The range of economic reforms initiated since mid-2004 have significantly
improved the economy’s fundamentals and enhanced its resilience to external shocks.
External vulnerability is further mitigated by the country’s net creditor position, with foreign
assets of the central bank and commercial banking sector well in excess of the external debt
stock and about nine times short-term debt.

4.
In addition to focusing on a reduction in price pressures, the authorities are cognizant
that a main challenge in the period ahead is to preserve the momentum of the reforms in the
face of broader disenchantment at the delays in the trickle-down of their benefits. Arguably,
the limited trickle-down of the reforms is not unusual, given that the current expansion is
driven essentially by growing financial integration, which tends to increase inequality by
increasing the premium on higher skills. Trickle-down would, therefore, have to be induced
through a set of well-designed measures aimed at unleashing the benefits of the reforms. To
this end, the authorities are committed to pursuing policies that would enhance the reach and
delivery of public social services, while at the same time persevering with the reform agenda
to safeguard macroeconomic stability. Going forward, the reform agenda will continue to
focus on reinforcing the foundations for a stronger expansion, through further fiscal
consolidation to remove distortions in the economy, second-generation financial sector
reforms to enhance and deepen financial intermediation and access to credit, and structural
reforms to strengthen the business climate in support of higher investment.
Fiscal Policy and Reforms
5.
Fiscal consolidation remains a key pillar of the reform program, with the objective of
bringing the deficit down to 3 percent by 2011 being guided by a range of well-identified
measures that are progressively being phased in. In line with this objective, the overall deficit
for the general government declined by 1.5 percent of GDP in 2006/07. These outturns are
consistent with an even larger adjustment in the underlying balance (excluding one-off
factors on both the revenue and expenditure sides), which improved by close to 2.7 percent
of GDP in 2006/07 to 8.7 percent. The adjustment was essentially expenditure-based,
reflecting a reduction in the fuel subsidy bill and wage restraint.
6.
In the period ahead, the authorities recognize the importance of maintaining a
tightening fiscal stance to remain supportive of monetary policy in containing demand
pressures and dealing with the implications of high capital inflows. The 2007/08 budget
appropriately envisages a further underlying budget adjustment of 1 percent of GDP to bring
the overall deficit down to 7.4 percent, through a balance of revenue-enhancing and
expenditure-reducing measures. On the revenue side, measures will focus on improved
collections from tax administration reforms. Importantly, laws on reforming the sales tax to a
full-fledged VAT will be presented during the current parliamentary session, with
implementation expected during the latter half of 2008. The envisaged VAT will carry a
unified rate, apply to a broader range of services, and increase the exemption threshold,
thereby enhancing buoyancy of the tax system. On the expenditure side, in addition to a
partial hiring freeze that is projected to further contain the drift in the wage bill, a decree has
been issued in September 2007 which rendered effective the phasing out over a three- to
five-year period of gas and electricity subsidies to energy-intensive industries. An important
element driving expenditure consolidation going forward is a reduced interest bill in the
context of lower budget deficits and financing needs.

3

Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
7.
Monetary policy has been focused on price stability and not the level of the exchange
rate, with the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) broadly targeting underlying inflation while
taking into account monetary aggregates and other indicators. In an attempt to rein in
inflation, the CBE raised its policy rates (the overnight lending and deposit facility rates) by
50 basis points in November 2006 and a further 25 basis points in December 2006 to
10.75 percent and 8.75 percent respectively. Policy rates have remained unchanged since,
reflecting easing pressures on both headline and core inflation as the base effect from the
price increases related to earlier supply shocks leveled off. Going forward, and with
continued gradual subsidy reduction envisaged under the fiscal adjustment program, the
authorities’ policies will focus on accommodating one-off effects from administered price
adjustments while aiming to contain second-round effects on other prices. Underlying
inflation will be kept within the single digits, and the monetary stance will remain vigilant
consistent with this objective.
8.
The authorities agree with staff’s assessment that the exchange rate is broadly in line
with fundamentals. They further welcome the convergence of views with staff that the
exchange rate regime is a managed float. The recent increased exchange rate flexibility was
introduced against the background of progress on key institutional prerequisites for inflation
targeting. These include a highly liquid foreign exchange market, improved ability to manage
foreign exchange risk, and enhanced institutional and technical capacity to adopt a credible
alternative nominal anchor. These developments reflect a range of initiatives introduced to
improve the monetary policy framework and support a more effective exchange rate
management. Together with recent efforts at establishing a meaningful yield curve through
global bond issuances at progressively longer maturities, the establishment of the interest rate
corridor has been effective in significantly reducing interest volatility and guiding market
expectations. This is paving the way for a more pronounced transmission channel for interest
rates going forward, as suggested in the Selected Issues paper. Moreover, predictability and
transparency of monetary policy have been enhanced, with the conclusions of the Monetary
Policy Committee, which meets every six weeks to set benchmark policy rates, being closely
scrutinized and guiding expectations of both domestic and international investors.
9.
For this purpose, the CBE has increased its placements of the large balance of
payments surpluses with commercial banks, in an effort to provide foreign exchange liquidity
to the system and strengthen the financial system’s creditworthiness. This strategy has also
helped limit the CBE’s sterilization needs. From this perspective, the authorities see limited
risk stemming from a surge in dollar-denominated bank credits, given that these deposits are
invested in very short-term instruments to preserve the liquidity feature of reserves. The
strengthened reserve position—part of which was on a one-off basis—was in part directed at
building a buffer to guard against the possibility of sudden outflows thereby increasing the
resiliency of the economy. Nonetheless, they will closely monitor commercial banks’ use of
the CBE’s placements of foreign exchange.

Financial Sector Reforms
10.
The Financial Sector Reform Program implemented since 2005 is transforming the
financial landscape in Egypt. Progress is on track on key elements of the reform program. In
particular, the privatization of Bank of Alexandria has been successfully completed, with
further ongoing action to privatize Banque du Caire, Egypt’s third largest bank, by mid-2008.
Together with large scale divestitures of state ownership in several banks, the majority of
banking assets is now held by the private sector. Decisive efforts have been made to clean up
banks’ balance sheets and settle non-performing loans (NPLs). Delinquencies by state-owned
enterprises have been significantly reduced and will be fully settled by end-2007 through
cash injections, sales of their investments, and settlements with private creditors. This should
appreciably bring down the ratio of NPLs. In addition, a comprehensive plan is being
implemented to strengthen bank regulation and supervision and align it with international
best practice by end-2008. Finally, the establishment of a private sector credit bureau,
regulated and supervised by the CBE, should help overcome some of institutional
impediments to bank lending stemming from the credit excesses of the late 1990s and
facilitate access to credit by the private sector.
11.
The non-banking sector has also witnessed equally important achievements. In the
insurance sector, three state insurers were merged into a holding company with the objective
of restructuring their financial and operational profiles for eventual privatization. In addition,
a new pension law has been drafted that overhauls the existing pension scheme completely.
The new scheme is based on a four pillar system comprising a basic pension, a notional
defined contribution account system, a fully funded component, and a voluntary additional
pillar. Moreover, and while still relatively small, the Egyptian stock market has been
expanding steadily, posting one of the best performances in the region. A small cap
exchange, NILEX, was also launched in October 2007, to encourage equity financing for
small- and medium-sized companies.
12.
The authorities are in broad agreement with the recommendations of the Financial
System Stability Assessment Update (FSSA). They recognize the developmental and
forward-looking character of the assessment, given that many of the recommendations
constitute elements of the ongoing reform agenda (2005–08). They take note of the findings
that the banking sector is resilient to exchange rate and interest rate shocks, albeit more
vulnerable to a deterioration in credit quality. While underscoring the depth and breadth of
the restructuring that the banking sector is currently undergoing, the authorities recognize the
importance of enhancing the quality of banks’ asset classification. Efforts to this end are
ongoing, as part of the broader objective of setting up an internal stress testing unit at the
CBE. Moreover, the authorities are aware of the potential conflict of interest associated with
the transitional arrangements during the reform process. Such arrangement was intentional in
view of requirements of the reform plan, and will be discontinued upon completion of the
reforms.

Other Structural Reforms
13.
In an effort to stimulate investment and private sector activity, the government has
also stepped up its privatization agenda, along with reforms to improve the business climate
and reduce red-tape. In this context, a total of 53 acquisitions and joint venture sale
operations were concluded in 2006/07, yielding close to LE14 billion in privatization
proceeds. In July 2007, a Declaration on International Investment and Multinational
Enterprises of the OECD was signed, setting a new stage for attracting foreign investments
and making Egypt the first Arab and African country to sign such declaration. Notably,
Egypt was judged to be the top reformer for 2006/07 according to the World Bank Doing
Business Report. Deep reforms were reflected in improvements along five key indicators:
starting a business, dealing with licenses, registering property, access to credit, and new onestop shops for traders at ports that considerably slashed the time for import and export
transits. In addition, and to address the delay characterizing civil and commercial procedures
in Egypt, an Economic Courts Bill will be submitted to parliament by end-2007 to establish
courts with specialization in commercial matters.
14.
Finally, the Egyptian authorities are committed to the vigorous pursuit of their reform
agenda to achieve a structurally higher growth rate. They would like to express their
appreciation for the extensive and highly valuable technical assistance they are receiving
from the Fund in support of their reform efforts, and thank staff for a productive consultation
and the reasonably balanced set of reports. They look forward to continued close
collaboration with the Fund in the period ahead.
