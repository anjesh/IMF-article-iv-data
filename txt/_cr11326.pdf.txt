STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2011 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
November 1, 2011

KEY ISSUES
Near term outlook and risks. The economy has staged an impressive recovery, with real
GDP expected to grow by 6¼ percent in 2011. The export-led recovery has broadened to
domestic demand, and the unemployment rate has fallen. Looking ahead, weaker
external demand and higher external financing costs will slow the economy, with growth
in 2012 projected at 3½ percent. Risks are clearly on the downside. An intensification of
global financial strains could lead to even weaker external demand and jeopardize
funding. With external conditions worsening, the priority is to reinforce macro stability.
Fiscal policy. The fiscal deficit has narrowed substantially since 2009, mostly reflecting
expenditure restraint. A further reduction in the fiscal deficit to 2.8 percent of GDP in
2012 is essential to put debt on a downward path, reduce financing needs, and preserve
euro adoption aspirations. Attention should be paid to the sustainability of the
adjustment, including by ensuring that any further spending cuts protect the most
vulnerable. Beyond 2012, additional consolidation will be needed to reach the
medium-term objective of a small budget surplus.
Financial stability. While the banking system as a whole appears well-positioned to
withstand adverse shocks, prompt corrective action is needed to address remaining
pockets of weakness. The strong recovery has boosted banking system profitability;
substantial increases in capital have raised the average capital adequacy ratio; and the
average liquidity ratio is well above the regulatory minimum. However, some banks have
made lower loan loss provisions than other banks, despite having higher NPL ratios. In
these banks, it will be necessary to assess risks conservatively, to make adequate loan
loss provisions, and to increase capital if needed.
Sustainable growth. The economy has started a welcome rebalancing towards tradable
sectors. Sustained growth over the medium term will require increased labor
participation, labor reallocation to tradable sectors, and higher investment. To support
the latter, further efforts are needed to improve the business environment.
Political situation. The government has a one-vote majority in parliament. Parliamentary
elections are expected in October 2012.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

REPUBLIC OF LITHUANIA

CONTEXT
A. Recent Developments
1.
Following a sharp output decline in
2008 and 2009, Lithuania has staged one of
the strongest recoveries in Europe. The
economy contracted by a cumulative
18 percent between the second quarter of
2008 and the last quarter of 2009, the fourth
largest peak to trough contraction in the world
after Latvia, Ukraine, and Estonia. But the
revival in exports that started in mid-2009
lifted the economy out of its slump, with GDP
expanding by 1.4 percent in 2010 and by
6.3 percent in the first half of 2011.
2.
Export growth has been the main
driver of the recovery. Exports were
underpinned by strong economic growth in
Lithuania’s main trading partners, including
Germany, Poland, and Russia. Sharp nominal
wage declines helped restore competitiveness,
leaving Lithuania well positioned to take full
advantage of higher external demand. Staff
estimates that the real exchange rate is now
broadly in line with fundamentals (Box 1).
Finally, prices for some of Lithuania’s key
agricultural exports have soared.

3.
Booming exports raised corporate
profitability and improved the labor
market. Higher sales revenue boosted
corporate profitability, with the aggregate
operating surplus and mixed income up by
some 60 percent since early 2010, and almost
back to pre-crisis levels. The unemployment
rate, which rose sharply from mid-2008 until
mid-2010, has started to fall. The ratio of
vacancies to unemployed has risen. As a result,
private sector average gross earnings, which
had fallen by some 12 percent from late 2008
(substantially more in some sectors like
construction), have picked up again, rising by a
cumulative 2.5 percent in the last three
quarters, more than offset by strong labor
productivity growth.
4.
As a result, the recovery has
broadened to domestic demand.
Improvements in the labor market and rising
consumer confidence have fed into private
consumption. Car sales have been especially
strong, reflecting pent-up demand. On the
corporate side, improved profitability and
rising capacity utilization rates led to higher
fixed investment. Gross fixed capital formation,
which contracted sharply until mid-2010, has
risen vigorously. The rebuilding of inventories
also contributed strongly to growth in 2010.
5.
Rebounding domestic demand,
import-intensive exports, and higher
energy prices have boosted imports. With
oil-related products constituting a third of
total imports, the rise in global energy prices
that lasted until mid-2011 was an important
factor. But non-oil imports have also been

The surge in food and energy prices
raised headline inflation, but pressures are
now abating. With food and energy
accounting for 40 percent of the CPI basket,
higher heating costs stemming from the
closure of the Ignalina nuclear plant in January
2010 and the run-up in food prices quickly
translated into higher headline inflation, which
peaked at 5.0 percent in May 2011. Since then,
food and energy prices have been falling on a
m/m basis, in line with global trends, bringing
headline inflation down to 4.7 percent in

September. After more than a year of
deflation, core prices started rising y/y in April
2011. Core inflation was 1.2 percent in
September, led by items such as clothing and
hotels, cafes, and restaurants.

strong, including consumer durables and
capital goods. As a result, the current account
swung from a 1.5 percent of GDP surplus in
2010 to a 1 percent of full-year GDP deficit in
the first half of 2011.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

B. Near-Term Outlook and Risks
7.
Growth is expected to slow sharply.
Given slowing external demand and
uncertainty about prospects, q/q growth (s.a.)
is projected to be only about 0.5 percent
(annualized) in the second half of 2011. For the
year as a whole, this implies growth of
6.3 percent, given the very strong first half. In
2012, the economy is expected to gradually
regain momentum, in line with the baseline
view in the Fall 2011 WEO that tensions in the
global economy will be resolved. Annual
growth in 2012 is projected to be 3½ percent.
As a result, the estimated negative output gap
should narrow from 2.7 percent in 2011 to
1.4 percent in 2012 (compared to 6.1 percent
in 2010).
8.
The external current account deficit
should remain manageable. The current
account deficit is expected to widen a little in
2012, as the slowdown in domestic demand is
projected to be less sharp than that of exports.
In both 2011 and 2012, the modest current

account deficits will be more than financed by
EU capital transfers. In the financial account,
net FDI is expected to be strong, and
repayments of liabilities by domestic bank
subsidiaries to their Scandinavian parents are
expected to decline, in line with recent trends.
9.
The labor market should continue to
improve. The unemployment rate is projected
to fall from 15.5 percent in 2011 (yearly
average) to 14 percent in 2012. Staff expects
average nominal gross earnings to grow by
3.3 percent this year and 4.1 percent next year.
10.
Headline inflation is expected to
moderate going forward. Consumer price
inflation is projected to fall to 3.8 percent at
end-2011, reflecting the easing of food and
energy price inflation, in line with recent
declines in international commodity prices.
Core inflation is expected to rise only
modestly, given still-high unemployment and a
negative output gap. The projected

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 5

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

REPUBLIC OF LITHUANIA

continuation of these trends (low non-core
inflation, core inflation rising slowly up to
2 percent) would result in 2.7 percent inflation
at end-2012 (and an annual average rate of
3.1 percent). While the uncertainties
surrounding inflation forecasts are large, it
appears at this stage that Lithuania may not
meet the Maastricht inflation criterion in 2012,
given the inflation forecasts for other EU
countries.
11.
Risks to growth are clearly on the
downside. Turmoil in the global economy
presents two major risks for Lithuania:




Heightened uncertainty. Both in Lithuania
and elsewhere, heightened uncertainty
could push consumers and firms to defer
investment spending, firms to defer hiring,
and banks to defer extending credit.
Lithuania is particularly exposed as
30 percent of its exports go to the euro
area.
Global financial markets freeze. While
external debt has fallen since 2009 as
foreign-owned banks have reduced
liabilities to their parents, it remains
relatively high. The government has fully
financed current year needs, but increases
in external borrowing costs would weigh
on the country given some 8 percent of

GDP in gross financing needs for next year.
In the banking system, subsidiaries or
branches of Scandinavian banks account
for three quarters of total assets. The
parent banks rely on wholesale markets to
cover about half of their total funding.
However, the Scandinavian authorities are
well prepared to deal with liquidity
pressures on their banks, given their
sizeable reserves, their preparedness to
extend the range of acceptable collateral,
and the possibility of re-activating swap
lines with major central banks.

Authorities’ views
12.
The authorities broadly agreed with
staff’s assessment of the outlook and risks.
They shared the view that growth and inflation
are likely to slow going forward, and that risks
are firmly on the downside. They underlined
Lithuania’s small size and high degree of
integration into the European economy. At the
same time, they considered that the impact of
any global crisis would be smaller than in
2008–09, as large imbalances have been
corrected. The authorities concurred with staff
that there is no remaining competitiveness gap
in the real exchange rate.

POLICY CHALLENGES
A. Reducing Government Debt and Financing Needs
13.
The fiscal deficit has narrowed
substantially since 2009, reflecting mainly
expenditure restraint. The general
government deficit (ESA basis) declined from
9.2 percent of GDP in 2009 to 7.1 percent of
GDP in 2010. In the first half of 2011, it fell by
1 percentage point of GDP compared to the

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

first half of 2010 (Figure 2). Staff projects a
fiscal deficit of 5.1 percent of GDP for 2011 as
a whole, compared to the government’s
original target of 5.8 percent of GDP (set in the
2011 budget) and the revised target of
5.3 percent of GDP (set in the Convergence
Program). In particular:

REPUBLIC OF LITHUANIA





Expenditure. Wage cuts instituted in 2009
resulted in a substantial decline in the
wage bill from 2009 to 2010, and these
gains are being preserved in 2011.
Similarly, social benefit payments—notably
pensions and parental benefits—were
reduced. All in all, staff expects total
expenditure to fall by 3 percentage points
of GDP in 2011, despite higher debt service
costs.





for automatic stabilizers to operate in
downturns. With government debt now
approaching 40 percent of GDP (up from
15.5 percent of GDP in 2008), such room is
limited. A small medium-term surplus
would put debt firmly on a declining path,
regaining some of the fiscal space lost in
the recent crisis.
General Government Debt
(Percent of GDP)

Revenue. VAT and excise duties are
growing fast, consistent with staff analysis
that suggests that VAT yields are procyclical (Box 2). However, direct taxes and
social contributions lagged behind, as
wages and employment have grown less
quickly than nominal GDP.

14.
Looking ahead, the government’s
2012 deficit target of 2.8 percent of GDP
and medium-term objective of a small
surplus are appropriate. In addition to
preserving euro adoption aspirations, a further
reduction in the fiscal deficit is needed to
reduce financing needs, put debt firmly on a
downward path, and prepare for population
aging:
Financing needs. The government has fully
financed 2011 needs. However, the
government has some 8 percent of GDP in
gross financing needs next year, including
refinancing the euro bonds that were
issued in 2002 and 2006. As buffers, the
government has several months of cash
reserves. There may also be scope for
greater domestic financing, given
significant liquidity in the banking system
and limited private demand for credit.
Regaining fiscal space. Given its high
exposure to external shocks and currency
board arrangement, Lithuania needs room



Population aging. Lithuania’s population is
projected to fall by 20 percent between
2010 and 2060, with the dependency ratio
rising from 1-to-4 to 1-to-2. The most
recent EC Sustainability Report projects
that, as a result of aging, government
spending could rise by as much as
6 percent of GDP over the long term. In
addition, rising health care costs could add
a further 4 percent of GDP to spending.

15.
While staff and the authorities
agreed that measures worth
1–1¼ percent of GDP are needed to reach
the 2012 target, staff emphasized that
consolidation be sustainable (Table 5). One
option would be to expand wealth taxation,
given that such taxes are less distortive than
other taxes, are progressive, and are relatively
low in Lithuania. Specifically, the taxation of
property and motor vehicles could be
expanded to include non-commercial usage,
with appropriate thresholds to protect poorer

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 7

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

REPUBLIC OF LITHUANIA

owners. Another option would be to broaden
tax bases. For example, the base of social
contributions could be broadened to include
all earnings categories, CIT exemptions (such
as the investment incentive) could be
eliminated, and pensions could be taxed as
regular personal income. In addition, staff
recommended that any further spending cuts
should aim to protect the most vulnerable, as
well as preserve investment levels.
16.
If downside risks to revenue
materialize, further fiscal measures would
be needed. While additional fiscal adjustment
would be procyclical, the scope for a wider
fiscal deficit is limited, as it would be more
difficult to finance, could shake investor
confidence, and would undermine euro
adoption aspirations. Therefore, the
government should draw up a list of saving
measures that could be implemented quickly if
revenue growth is weaker than expected.

reform. Staff thus supports recent
guidelines on pension reform approved by
Parliament which call for linking future
benefits to demographic factors. In
tandem with these reforms, the basic social
pension could be separated out and
financed from the general budget.


Health care reform. The government is
consolidating hospitals, given the relatively
high number of hospital beds per capita,
and concentrating medical procedures in
fewer, higher-volume centers, so as to
benefit from economies of scale.



State-owned enterprises (SOEs). With SOE
assets accounting for some 25 percent of
GDP, efficiency gains could yield
substantial transfers to the government as
well as benefit the economy as a whole.
With this in mind, the government
completed a major inventory of SOE assets
last year, which has been published. There
is also ongoing work to assess the social
functions of SOEs. Rigorous cost-benefit
analysis should be expanded, as some
operations may be too costly given the
social benefit they provide. Governance
reform is also needed, particularly with
respect to the independence and
professional experience of boards of
directors.



Tax compliance. The government has
launched an ambitious compliance
strategy, supported by Fund technical
assistance. A Commission for Coordination
of Cooperation among State Economic and
Financial Control Authorities has been set
up to provide strategic guidance and
monitor the implementation process.
Following Fund advice, the State Tax
Inspectorate (STI) has improved the

17.
Over the medium term, additional
adjustment will be needed to achieve the
government’s medium-term objective.
Based on announced policies and staff’s
medium-term outlook, cumulative adjustment
of about 2 percentage points of GDP is
required in addition to the 2012 effort. In this
context, structural reforms are important:


8

Pension reform. In June, Parliament
approved a gradual increase in the pension
age to 65 for both men and women, from
62.5 and 60 in the current system,
respectively. This is an important step that
is expected to deliver at least 1 percent of
GDP in annual savings over the long run,
but is insufficient in itself. Because of the
size of demographic changes, and because
benefits are indexed to wages, the system
will not be sustainable without further

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF LITHUANIA

allocation of resources earmarked for tax
inspection, now focusing the majority of its
efforts on a relatively small number of
large and medium-size businesses
representing about half of total turnover in
the country. In addition, STI has put in
place new training programs for tax
inspectors, and legislative changes have
been introduced allowing the government
to collect unpaid taxes from enterprises
facing bankruptcy proceedings. Going
forward, staff supports the authorities’
plans to tighten tax compliance further by
expanding the use of cash registers,
reducing loopholes through which
business licenses can be used for tax
avoidance, and stepping up the fight
against border smuggling.
18.
Improvements to the fiscal
framework would help underpin mediumterm consolidation efforts. Currently under
consideration are amendments to the fiscal
framework which would tighten rules on the
use of Treasury reserves, strengthen the role of
independent evaluation in budget planning
and execution, and introduce an additional
fiscal rule requiring a decline in the headline
deficit of at least 0.6 percent of GDP whenever
the projected output gap is positive. Tighter
access to fiscal reserves would be an important
step, as it would help discipline spending. At
the same time, independent evaluation should
be entrusted to a new body such as a fiscal
council. Also, while the proposed additional
rule provides a welcome focus on countercyclicality, it would be difficult to implement:

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

linking it to the sign of the projected output
gap is hard to manage effectively, and the
setting of a 0.6 percent of GDP fiscal
adjustment whenever the output gap is
positive would seem arbitrary. Instead, it would
be better to complement the existing
expenditure rule, which provides sensible
targets for the forecast horizon, with a “debt
brake,” in line with the objective of bringing
debt down to well below 40 percent of GDP.

Authorities’ views
19.
The authorities underlined their
commitment to the 2012 fiscal deficit
target of 2.8 percent of GDP. However, they
pointed to the difficulty of introducing new
taxes in an election year. Instead, they said
they would meet the target by increasing
non-tax revenue and reducing spending. Given
the strong financial performance of SOEs in
2011, they saw scope for higher dividend
receipts of about ½ percent point of GDP in
2012. In addition, land sales could yield
¼ percent of GDP, and a change in the
valuation method for the land tax
(administered by local governments) could
yield ¼ percent of GDP. They also planned to
reduce ministries’ spending allocations by
2 percent across the board, which would save
another ¼ percent of GDP. Should downside
risks to revenues materialize, they would
consider a supplementary budget to achieve
the 2012 fiscal target. Finally, they said that
work on the fiscal rule is still ongoing and that
they would take into account staff’s
suggestions.

B. Ensuring Banking System Resilience
20.
The strong recovery has boosted
banking system performance (Figure 3).
Nonperforming loans, which rose sharply from

mid-2008 to end-2009, have stabilized. Several
banks, which provisioned aggressively for NPLs
when they were rising, have recently reduced

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 9

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

REPUBLIC OF LITHUANIA

loan loss provisions. Lower loan loss provisions
and higher net interest margins have
supported an improvement in banking system
profitability. Cumulative profits in the four
quarters to 2011Q2 reached €188 million,
compared with €1 billion in losses in previous
four quarters. Return on assets improved from
negative 4.8 percent at end-2009 to positive
1.3 percent in the most recent four quarters,
close to ROA during the boom.
21.
The banking system as a whole is
liquid and well capitalized. Increases in
capital, which in 2009-10 amounted to
3 percent of GDP or 40 percent of bank capital
measured at end 2008, played a key role in
preserving financial stability. Banking system
prudential ratios are now well above
regulatory minima: the average capital
adequacy ratio was at 14.8 percent in 2011Q2,
while the Tier 1 and core Tier 1 ratios were
11.4 percent and 10.3 percent respectively,
above future Basel III requirements. Similarly,
the average ratio of liquid assets to current
liabilities was slightly above 40 percent
(compared to the regulatory minimum of
30 percent); the central bank’s preliminary
calculations suggest that the liquidity coverage
ratio was close to 200 percent, and the net
stable funding ratio was slightly below
100 percent (the Basel III requirements for the
latter two are minima of 100 percent).
22.
The banking system’s strong capital
position suggests that supply factors are
not the main reason behind low credit
growth. Both stock and flow indicators of
credit remain weak, but in staff’s view this
mostly reflects lack of demand as corporations
and households continue to repair their
balance sheets. Recently, greater uncertainty
about global economic developments has
dampened appetite for investment. On the

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

supply side, it is reassuring that banks have
tightened lending standards on construction
and real estate related sectors (where excess
capacity is large) but not on export sectors
(which are growing rapidly). Anecdotal
evidence suggests that there is competition
among banks to provide credit to good
corporate borrowers.
23.
Most banks are well-positioned to
withstand further shocks. While no
Lithuanian bank was included in the EBA stress
tests, recent stress tests by the Bank of
Lithuania (BOL) show that, under a large
decline (13 percentage points) in export
volumes and a sharp spike (260–440 basis
points) in interest rates, aggregate and median
CARs would still remain above 10 percent.
Similarly, the aggregate liquidity ratio would
remain above 30 percent even with a
10 percent deposit drain, and would fall only
marginally below 30 percent with a 15 percent
deposit drain. While foreign-owned banks are
dependent on funding from their parents (their
average loan-to-deposit ratio is still about
150 percent), parents did not curtail funding
abruptly in 2009–10.
24.
Despite generally encouraging
developments, remaining pockets of
weakness should be addressed without
delay. A few banks, which account for
15-20 percent of deposits and do not have
liquidity backstops from foreign parents, have
set aside lower provisions for losses than
others despite having higher NPL ratios. Under
the adverse scenarios in the BOL stress tests,
these banks did not meet minimum capital
requirements. Prompt corrective action is
needed to address these weaknesses before
they get bigger and to minimize any potential
costs. Supervisors should enforce conservative
assessment of risks in these banks,
require adequate loan loss provisions,

REPUBLIC OF LITHUANIA

and demand capital increases when this is
warranted. If the need arises, the law provides
the necessary authority to take adequate
measures. In line with European and global
initiatives, as well as earlier Fund technical
assistance, it is urgent to broaden the range of
resolution tools, for example to include a
purchase and assumption option.
25.
Plans to unify financial supervision
should lead to better identification of risks
and trouble spots. At present, the central
bank is responsible for bank supervision, while
insurance and securities companies are
supervised by an insurance commission and a
securities commission, respectively. A draft law
currently in parliament would unify supervision
(as well as a newly created consumer
protection agency) under the BOL. Unification
of supervision makes sense in Lithuania given
economies of scope, with many insurance and
securities companies owned by banks.
Preparations to implement the new
organizational structure in early 2012 are well
under way. However, the draft law is silent
about the reporting responsibilities of the
head of supervision. It will be important that
this function report directly to the highest
governing body of the BOL. In addition, the
imminent introduction of responsible lending
guidelines (which include limits on loan-to-

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

value and debt service-to-income ratios)
should help contain systemic risk in the future.
26.
More effective insolvency regimes
are needed. A corporate insolvency regime
exists, but is widely regarded as too slow, in
part because the law does not provide
adequate guidance to judges. A new law on a
personal insolvency regime is currently in
parliament. The proposed law is broadly in line
with Fund advice. However, there is room for
improvement in a few areas, notably to allow
creditors (and not only debtors) to initiate
bankruptcy proceedings. The draft law also
lacks collective enforcement mechanisms when
no plan has been submitted to or approved by
the courts, or when proceedings have been
declared terminated. It will also be important
to ensure the availability of advisory services to
debtors on their rights under the new regime.

Authorities’ views
27.
The authorities broadly agreed with
staff’s assessment of financial sector stability
and risks. They said that they are determined
to be proactive in assessing credit quality and
requiring remedial action where necessary.
They do not plan to allow creditors to initiate
personal bankruptcy proceedings, as they
consider that civil courts provide enough
recourse.

C. Sustaining Growth over the Medium Term
28.
Sustaining the recovery over the
medium term will require balanced growth.
During the economic expansion that preceded
the crisis, resources were increasingly allocated
to nontradable sectors, which have little room
for productivity enhancements. Looking
forward, it will be important that resources go
to tradable sectors, which will also help
minimize external imbalances. Early signs are

encouraging (Box 3). The contribution of
tradable sectors to Lithuania’s strong recovery
has been about 50 percent, much higher than
during the pre-crisis boom. In addition, the
sharp depreciation of Lithuania’s ULC-based
REER suggests that international price
competitiveness is not a problem. However,
there is not yet evidence of stronger

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 11

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

REPUBLIC OF LITHUANIA

employment growth in tradables compared to
nontradables.
29.
Sustained growth also requires
strong investment (Box 4). The investment to
GDP ratio fell sharply during the crisis. Under
staff’s central medium-term scenario, lower
investment will lead to lower labor productivity
growth, at precisely the time when the labor
force is projected to shrink due to population
aging and migration. Altogether, staff
estimates potential growth of 3½–4 percent,
which implies slower convergence of living
standards to the EU average than before.

30.
Boosting employment participation
and reallocating labor towards tradable
sectors will be key. Sustaining even 4 percent
potential output growth in the face of lower
investment and a shrinking labor force will
require large increases in the employment
ratio, from around 60 percent currently to
some 65 percent in the medium-term in the
staff baseline forecasts. For this to happen, the
labor market will have to reallocate resources
towards growing sectors in the face of skill
mismatches. To facilitate this process, staff
support plans to make permanent changes to
the Labor Code that allow greater use of fixed
term contracts for new vacancies. Given that
fixed term contracts are imperfect substitutes
for permanent ones, temporary crisis measures
12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

which reduced firing costs on the latter could
also be extended. In parallel, full use should be
made of EU funds to support job schemes,
expand training programs, and enhance the
efficiency of labor bureaus. Finally, proposals
to raise the minimum wage should be
evaluated carefully, as they might slow job
creation, reverse recent competitiveness gains,
and increase government spending at this
difficult time (as wages and benefits are tied to
the minimum wage).
31.
Efforts to improve the business
environment are also important.
Requirements for starting a business (including
registration processes) have been
commendably streamlined, though it will be
important to ensure that the shorter timetable
for obtaining a construction permit is
implemented. The new law on business
inspections is also welcome, as it separates
policy making from policy implementation,
increases transparency, and strengthens
coordination among inspection agencies. Staff
also supports the proposed law on
strengthening the role of the Competition
Council, as it would grant the council authority
to more proactively investigate breaches of
competition rules.

Authorities’ views
32.
The authorities shared the view that
potential output growth has fallen since the
crisis, with their estimate close to 4 percent.
They agreed that sustaining growth will
require reallocating resources towards tradable
sectors despite skill mismatches. They pointed
to initiatives to make the labor code more
flexible, improve the business environment,
and enhance efficiency in SOEs. Regarding EU
funds, they noted that Lithuania has one of the
highest absorption rates in the EU. Finally, the

REPUBLIC OF LITHUANIA

authorities noted that raising the minimum
wage could enhance labor supply incentives
(as it is currently barely above the level of

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

unemployment benefits), improve the
reporting of wages for tax purposes, and help
to reduce income inequality.

D. Euro Adoption
33.
Staff supports the authorities’
intention to meet the Maastricht criteria in
2012. The exchange rate arrangement (both
de facto and de jure) is a currency board
pegged to the euro. Meeting the fiscal deficit
target for 2012 of 2.8 percent of GDP is an
important step towards the MTO, as well as
necessary to preserve euro adoption
aspirations. With regard to the inflation
criterion, price controls should not be used to
reduce inflation.

Authorities’ views
34.
The authorities expressed their
determination to meet the Maastricht
criteria as soon as possible. They
acknowledged that inflation could be above
the criterion in 2012, but said that they had
no intention of taking unorthodox measures
to reduce inflation.

STAFF APPRAISAL
35.
The economy has staged an
impressive recovery, based on a supportive
global environment and determined policy
adjustment. Policy action included sizeable
fiscal consolidation, the maintenance of
confidence in the banking system, and
significant wage adjustment that underpinned
gains in competitiveness. After contracting
sharply in 2008-09, economic activity grew
modestly in 2010 and robustly in the first half
of 2011. The export-led recovery broadened to
domestic demand and employment growth
accelerated.
36.
With the worsening of external
conditions, a further strengthening of
policies is needed. As weaker demand from
the euro area dampens export growth, and
higher external financing costs are passed on
to bank lending in Lithuania, economic growth
will slow sharply in 2012. Risks to the
economic outlook are clearly on the downside.
An intensification of financial strains in Europe

could lead to even weaker external demand
and jeopardize funding.
37.
Further fiscal consolidation is
needed to preserve Lithuania’s good fiscal
record. The authorities’ commitment to
reducing the fiscal deficit to 2.8 percent of
GDP in 2012 is welcome, though some of the
proposed measures (such as extraordinary SOE
dividends and land sales) do not appear to be
sustainable. Also, in implementing spending
cuts, it will be important to protect the most
vulnerable people and preserve the level of
public investment. Looking forward, expanding
wealth taxation and broadening tax bases
remain important options. Given the upside
risk to the fiscal deficit stemming from the
downside risk to economic growth, a
contingency plan consisting of further
measures should be prepared.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 13

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

REPUBLIC OF LITHUANIA

38.
Important fiscal reforms already
underway should be deepened. Given
population aging, further reform of the
pension system to ensure long-term
sustainability is needed. The cost-benefit
analysis of state-owned enterprises’ social
functions should be enhanced and governance
reforms should be developed. Plans to further
improve tax compliance are welcome. The role
of independent evaluation in budget planning
and execution could be expanded, and a
strengthening of the existing expenditure rule
could be considered.
39.
The banking system as a whole
appears well-positioned to withstand
adverse shocks, but remaining pockets of
weakness should be addressed without
delay. The strong recovery has boosted
banking system profitability; substantial
increases in capital have raised the average
capital adequacy ratio; and the average
liquidity ratio is well above the regulatory
minimum. Recent stress tests by the central
bank show that the banking system as a whole
is resilient to substantial shocks to capital and
liquidity. However, some banks have made
lower loan loss provisions than other banks,
despite having higher NPL ratios. In these
banks, it will be necessary to assess risks
conservatively, to make appropriate loan loss
provisions, and to increase capital if necessary.
If the need arises, existing law provides the
necessary authority to take adequate
measures. In line with European and global

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

initiatives, it is urgent to broaden the range of
resolution tools.
40.
The planned unification of financial
supervision under the BOL will strengthen
the authorities’ ability to identify and
address risks to the financial system. The
head of supervision should report directly to
the highest governing body of the central
bank. In addition, the imminent introduction of
responsible lending guidelines to contain
systemic risk is welcome. To ensure that viable
individual borrowers can recover and that
creditors have adequate protection, an
effective personal insolvency regime is needed.
41.
Sustainable growth over the
medium term depends on increased labor
participation, labor reallocation to tradable
sectors, and strong investment. Greater use
of fixed-term contracts could stimulate job
creation. By contrast, raising the minimum
wage at this juncture could slow job creation,
reverse recent competitiveness gains, and
increase government spending. Full use should
be made of EU structural funds to overcome
skill mismatches. To encourage investment,
further efforts are needed to improve the
business environment. The new law on
business inspections and the proposed law on
strengthening the role of the Competition
Council are welcome.
42.
It is proposed to hold the next Article
IV consultation on the regular 12-month cycle.

Box 1. Real Exchange Rate Assessment
The depreciation of the real exchange
rate since 2008–09 has mostly reflected
significant nominal wage declines. Since
the peak, the whole-economy ULC-based
REER has depreciated by 12 percent, and the
manufacturing ULC-based REER by
19 percent. The latter is now back to its 2000
level and some 11 percent below its 2005
level. The CPI-based REER has depreciated
by less, as consumer prices declined less
sharply than wages.

Box 2. Time-Varying Tax Elasticities1
Historical, cross-country evidence suggests that tax revenues grow more quickly than their
underlying bases during expansions and contract more sharply during recessions. The deviation of
short-run tax elasticities from their long-run equilibriums can be driven by short-changes in the composition
of tax bases and cyclical variations in tax compliance. In Lithuania, the VAT elasticity is especially important,
as VAT revenue accounts for about half of total tax revenue. Staff analysis finds that the elasticity of VAT has
fluctuated between 0.5 and 1.5 over the past decade.

Box 3. Rebalancing Growth1
After the boom in non-tradables ended in a crisis,
will the economy rebalance towards export
sectors? The post-crisis recovery has been very much
export driven, and the contribution of tradable sectors
to total growth, at some 50 percent, has been much
higher than in the past. The impressive export
performance has helped Lithuania achieve the second
strongest recovery in central and eastern Europe after
Estonia.

reallocation of resources in the economy?
Lithuanian exports have benefitted from temporary factors, including increases in the global prices of key exports
(especially food products and fertilizers) that could easily reverse. Signs of a more sustained reallocation are
mixed:
 Labor: with the exception of the transportation sector, tradable sectors have generally not contributed
more to employment growth than non-tradable sectors. It may be that exporting firms are uncertain about
prospects, so are delaying hiring new workers.
 FDI: while net FDI as a percent of GDP is lower than before the crisis, the composition of FDI has shifted
towards tradable sectors. FDI flows into real estate or financial intermediation have fallen by some
2½ percentage points of GDP relative to pre-crisis levels, but flows into manufacturing have stayed constant.
In short, there are early signs of a reallocation of resources towards tradable sectors, but this is not yet firmly
entrenched. Going forward, it will be important to ensure that competitiveness is not eroded.

Box 4. Medium-Term Growth Prospects1
Medium-term growth rates in the Baltic countries
will likely be lower than before the 2008–09 crisis.
Empirical specifications based on the growth
literature, which link economic growth to variables
such as initial income, investment, education,
institutional quality, and quality of macroeconomic
policies, suggest that medium-term growth rates in
the Baltic countries will be in the range of
3¼–4¼ percent. This is 4–5 percentage points lower
than during the 2002–07 boom, a decline which is due
to the following factors:

 Growth during the boom was unsustainably
high. Estimating the same models in 2002 would have predicted growth rates about 2–2½ percentage
points below actual growth during the boom.
 Baltic countries are wealthier today than they were in the early 2000s. In all three Baltic countries,
income per capita was higher in 2010 than in the early 2000s, despite the collapse in output over
2008–09. Given conditional convergence (the phenomenon that ceteris paribus poorer countries tend to
grow faster than richer countries), the Baltic countries should be expected to grow more slowly going
forward. Econometric estimates suggest that the convergence effect accounts for about ¾ percentage
point of the projected decline in growth.
 Investment has fallen. In the Baltics, investment ratios were artificially boosted during the boom, but
these gains were more than fully wiped out by the crisis. The decline in investment has not been limited
to construction: non-construction investment also plummeted and is now about half the level seen over
much of the last 15 years. Experience from countries with similar boom-bust cycles suggests investment
could be slow to recover. If investment today was at 1998 levels, ceteris paribus, yearly predicted growth
would be 1 percentage point higher in Latvia and Lithuania, and 1¾ percentage points in Estonia.
Lower investment will imply slower growth of labor productivity and hence a slower catch-up of
living standards with the EU average. Labor productivity is projected to grow between 3¼–3¾
percentage points more slowly than during the boom years. And the slowdown in labor productivity will
come at a time when the labor force is expected to shrink due to population aging and emigration.
Sustaining even 4 percent GDP growth will thus require large increases in employment ratios.

1/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms, g = real GDP growth rate,
e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and rising
inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels
of the last projection year.

Force’s (FATF) 40+9 Recommendations, was
assessed by MONEYVAL, the FATF-style
regional body of which it is a member, in
January 2006. The ensuing AML/CFT
assessment report was adopted by the
MONEYVAL Plenary in November of that same
year. Since then it has produced two progress
reports, the first of which was adopted in
March 2008 and the most recent report was
adopted in March 2010. At the occasion of
Lithuania’s latest progress report the
significant steps taken by Lithuania over the
past years were acknowledged. At the same
time the country indicated that it was still
working on amending its Criminal Code to
unify its money laundering definitions, to bring
this definition in line with the Vienna and
Palermo Conventions and to ensure dissuasive
criminal sanctions against money laundering.
According to the authorities, since the
assessment report was adopted better
customer due diligence (CDD) measures were
introduced, including regarding the
identification of shareholders of legal persons,
and improvements were made regarding the
obligation to transmit suspicious transaction
reports (STRs). They also stated progress was
made in the areas of implementation of UN
instruments and the freezing and confiscation
of terrorist assets.

THE REPUBLIC OF LITHUANIA 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Over the past several years, Lithuania has
made good progress in establishing a
macroeconomic database. Official data for all
sectors are adequate for surveillance purposes.
Lithuania subscribed to the Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS) in May 1996,
and its metadata have been posted on the
Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board
(DSBB) since April 1997. Lithuania meets the
SDDS specifications for coverage, periodicity
and timeliness of the data, and for the
dissemination of the advance release
calendars. A significant amount of economic
and financial information is now available on
various websites through the Internet (see
section on Dissemination of Statistics, below).
A ROSC data module was published in
November 2002.
National Accounts
The national accounts are compiled by
Statistics Lithuania (SL) (the former
Department of Statistics) in accordance with
the guidelines of the European System of
Accounts 1995 (ESA 95). Quarterly GDP
estimates at current and at constant prices are
compiled using both the production and
expenditure approaches. GDP estimates by
production are considered to be more reliable
than the corresponding estimates by
expenditure, but no statistical discrepancies
between these two estimates are shown
separately in the published figures as the
discrepancies are included in the estimates of
changes in inventories. The annual and the
quarterly national accounts are compiled at
previous year prices and chain-linked to 2000.
In general, good data sources and sound

methods are used for the compilation of the
national accounts, but measuring activity in
the current volatile environment is proving
very challenging. Moreover, difficulties remain
in measuring the economic activity of the
informal sector. These estimates are compiled
at detailed levels of economic activity using
fixed coefficients derived from a benchmark
surveys conducted in 1996 and 2003, and
updated in 2006. According to the most
recent updates, the informal sector was
estimated to be 13 percent of GDP in 2008. A
new benchmark survey will be released at the
end of 2011.
Price Data
Since December 1998, CPI weights have been
updated annually. The monthly CPI is available
in the second week following the reference
month. The producer price index is calculated
according to the chain-linked Laspeyres
formula with weights updated every year.
Public Finance
Data on the central government budget
execution are available at a monthly and
quarterly frequency, although these data are
subject to frequent revisions. The ongoing
treasury project is expected to improve fiscal
data quality substantially. However, further
work is needed to clarify the treatment of
public health care providers and of EU
transactions, and the consolidation procedure
for government operations. A new
classification, incorporating the GFSM2001 was
approved in mid-2003. Since then, the MoF
has been reporting to STA general
government’s annual data on an accrual and

DSBB. Since late 2004, the BoL disseminates
quarterly external debt data in the World
Bank’s Quarterly External Debt Statistics
(QEDS) database.

Monetary and Financial Statistics

The authorities publish a range of economic
statistics through a number of publications,
including the SL's monthly publication,
Economic and Social Developments, and the
BoL's monthly Bulletin. A significant amount of
data are available on the Internet:

The Bank of Lithuania (BoL) reports monetary
and financial statistics (MFS) to STA on a timely
and regular basis. The scope, concepts and
definitions of the MFS are broadly in line with
the guidelines of the Monetary and Financial
Statistics Manual (MFSM). Following
Lithuania’s accession to the European Union,
the BoL implemented the ECB framework for
compiling and reporting monetary data
reflecting the ECB regulations and ESA 95 on
sectorization, valuation and classification of
financial instruments.

monthly and quarterly basis) are compiled
using the format recommended in the Balance
of Payments Manual, fifth edition (BPM5). The
monthly data correspond to several key
balance of payments components, compiled
on the basis of a sample survey covering the
public sector, commercial banks, and some
nonfinancial private sector institutions. The

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with the
Republic of Lithuania
On November 16, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with the Republic of Lithuania. 1
Background
The economy has staged an impressive recovery, based on a supportive global environment
and determined policy adjustment. After contracting sharply in 2008-09, economic activity grew
by 1½ percent in 2010 and a robust 6¼ percent in the first half of 2011. The main driver of the
recovery was export growth, underpinned by strong external demand and sharp nominal wage
declines that restored competitiveness. There are early signs of a reallocation of resources
towards tradable sectors, such as rapid growth of employment in the transport sector and an
increase in the share of foreign direct investment going to manufacturing.
The export-led recovery has over the past year broadened to domestic demand, lowered
unemployment, and stabilized wages. With higher domestic demand stimulating imports, the
current account has moved from a slight surplus in 2010 to a small deficit in 2011. External
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.
1

2
debt has fallen since 2009 as foreign-owned banks have reduced liabilities to their parents, but
is still relatively high. Higher energy and food prices pushed up inflation in early 2011, but
inflation has slowed recently in line with international commodity price trends.
The fiscal deficit narrowed from 9.2 percent of GDP in 2009 to 7.1 percent of GDP in 2010,
and has continued to contract thus far in 2011. Fiscal consolidation reflected mostly reductions
in wages and social benefit payments. The government has fully financed its needs in 2011,
but has some 8 percent of GDP in gross financing needs in 2012.
The banking system as a whole is on the mend, but pockets of weakness remain.
Nonperforming loans have stabilized, net interest margins have risen, the average capital
adequacy ratio is above the pre-crisis level, and liquidity has increased. However, a few banks
have set aside lower provisions for losses than others despite having higher nonperforming
loan ratios.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for Lithuania’s impressive economic recovery,
noting in particular the sizeable fiscal consolidation, the maintenance of confidence in the
banking system, and the significant wage adjustment that underpinned gains in
competitiveness. The export-led recovery has broadened to domestic demand and reduced
unemployment. Given heightened uncertainty in the external environment, Directors
underlined the importance of continued vigilance and sustained progress in strengthening
fiscal, financial, and structural policies.
Directors supported the authorities’ goal of further reducing the fiscal deficit, thereby putting
government debt on a downward path. They considered it desirable to rely on sustainable
measures, including the expansion of wealth taxation and broadening tax bases, while
protecting spending on public investment and the most vulnerable people from further cuts.
Directors saw merit in preparing a contingency plan in the event that downside risks to growth
materialize. Over the medium term, Directors recommended further strengthening tax
compliance, the fiscal framework, the pension and health care systems, and the governance of
state-owned enterprises.
Directors observed that the banking system as a whole is liquid and well capitalized.
Addressing remaining pockets of weakness is a priority, including through conservative risk
assessments, appropriate loan loss provisions, and further capital increases where necessary.
Directors also emphasized the need for a broader range of bank resolution tools and more
effective personal and corporate insolvency regimes, along the lines of European and global
initiatives. They looked forward to progress in unifying financial supervision under the central
bank.

3
Directors underscored that enhancing labor participation and facilitating labor reallocation to
tradable sectors are key to sustainable growth. They supported the authorities’ intention to
expand the use of fixed-term contracts and make full use of EU structural funds to overcome
skill mismatches. Directors called for a cautious approach to increasing the
minimum wage, consistent with productivity developments. Further efforts to improve the
business environment are also crucial.

Statement by Mr. Benny Andersen, Executive Director for the Republic of Lithuania
and Mr. Rimtautas Bartkus, Advisor to the Executive Director
November 16, 2011
The Lithuanian authorities highly appreciate the Fund’s economic policy advice and thank
Mr. Morsink and his team for productive discussions and valuable policy insights provided
during the 2011 Article IV consultations in Vilnius. The authorities broadly agree with staff’s
analysis and policy recommendations. The recent years have been exceptional for economic
policy making in Lithuania. The authorities had to steer the economy to a safe landing after
the domestic demand boom burst and when the worsening external outlook provided
additional tailwinds. Supported by determined policy actions and inner flexibility of the
economy, macroeconomic imbalances have been quickly reversed and the economy staged a
quick recovery as the external demand strengthened. During one of the largest economic
adjustments in the country’s history, the society demonstrated unique perseverance and
political stability has been maintained. The economic adjustment in Lithuania is becoming
more structural as the political capital is being increasingly allocated on deepening the
structural reforms that should pave the way for a more sustainable growth model, enhance
fiscal transparency and soundness, as well as financial resilience. Policies pursued by the
Lithuanian authorities are fully aligned with the euro area membership objective.
Economic outlook and risks
The macroeconomic scenario foreseen by the authorities is in line with staff’s projections.
The recently announced data confirm that robust economic expansion continued in the third
quarter of 2011 with real GDP increasing by 6.6 percent year-on-year. Large internal
adjustment and deleveraging that occurred in 2008-09 improved Lithuania’s economic
competitiveness and allowed Lithuania to benefit strongly from the more favorable external
conditions. The signs of economic reorientation have occurred with the tradable sector
playing a more prominent role in the recovery. Significant improvement in unit labor costs
supported export performance and allowed to gain export market shares. The export volume
reached its pre-crisis highs already in October 2010 and strong positive developments in the
export sector continued in the course of 2011 before moderating lately, in line with the
changing economic sentiment in Lithuania’s key export markets.
The export-led recovery that started in 2010 broadened to domestic demand in 2011 and has
eventually become a twin-engine growth. Demand for investment has returned with
improving corporate profitability and higher capacity utilization, whereas increasing
employment strengthened consumer confidence. The strong surplus in the services balance
and increasing current transfers had a positive effect on the current account, but the current
account recorded a small deficit as the demand for imported investment goods picked up
markedly. Going forward, the modest current account deficit will be fully financed by the
capital transfers from the EU. The net FDI flows should also increase as the authorities’
efforts to improve Lithuania’s investment environment should yield higher dividends.

2
While the annual HICP inflation remains at an elevated level, it started to come down lately
following the decline in the global food and energy prices. The core inflation returned to a
positive territory after prolonged deflation, but it remains contained.
The situation in the labor market has started to improve gradually, although the
unemployment rate is projected to stay above its historical average. Observed positive
developments in employment were broad-based and not limited to a narrow set of economic
activities. The employment dynamics have been favorably affected by the improved
economic outlook. The amendments to the labor code that provided better opportunities for
temporary and part-time hiring also contributed to the labor demand as it allowed the
companies to adjust more smoothly to the fluctuating demand for new orders.
Overall, the economy is now in a much healthier condition to withstand potential shocks,
though trade and financial integration constitutes higher spillovers risks for Lithuania.
Acknowledging this risk, the projected economic growth of 4.7 percent in 2012 could be
revised by approximately 1 percentage point downwards.
Fiscal policy and structural reforms
The authorities’ fiscal strategy is geared towards restoring public finance sustainability,
putting debt on a downward trajectory, and preserving market confidence in the
consolidation efforts. The track record of implementation certifies that the consolidation path
is firmly established. The fiscal outturn for 2010 was 1 percentage point better than initially
projected due to stronger revenue growth and maintained strict expenditure control. Taking
into account improved economic outlook, the authorities revised the 2011 fiscal deficit target
to 5.3 percent of GDP and are well on track to secure the final outcome for the general
government deficit even below 5 percent of GDP. The consolidation measures in 2011
included further extension of expenditure cuts on public sector wages and pensions,
reduction of generous parental benefits, and better targeting social support. The reduced
transfers to the private pension funds (Pillar 2) are maintained until the further reform of the
pension system and its privately funded part has been implemented.
The draft 2012 budget is set to achieve the 2.8 percent of GDP fiscal deficit target. The
general government debt is projected to slightly decrease in 2012 to 37.3 percent of GDP and
the financing needs will be met by borrowing in domestic and international markets. The
recent USD 750 million bonds (a tap of the existing USD 750 million bond due in 2021)
issued in international capital markets serves as a pre-funding exercise for the next year and
confirms Lithuania’s access to international capital markets at a reasonable price even during
volatile markets. Under the 2012 draft budget, the public sector wage freeze will be
maintained; appropriations for the ministries will be cut by additional 2 percent; and the
reduced social assistance and unemployment benefits will become permanent. The primary
expenditure excluding the co-financing for the EU supported investment projects will be 1.8
percent lower compared to 2011. Taking into account social vulnerability of the retired
persons, the crisis related cut in pensions will not be extended, though the pensions will
remain below their pre-crisis level in real terms due to absence of indexation. To ensure that
the 2.8 percent fiscal deficit target is met, the budget law will establish an interim

3
expenditure ceiling and introduce the requirement for a supplementary budget if it becomes
clear that the revenue plan is unlikely to be met by the margin of 3 percent.
The authorities’ fiscal consolidation efforts are focused on the fruits that have matured and
on the completion of the structural reforms that have already been started. No significant tax
changes are foreseen for 2012 so far. Building on the success of the tax compliance strategy
that has been developed with the technical support from the Fund, the authorities plan further
measures to increase tax compliance. In addition to the numerical expenditure rule that is
currently in place, the authorities consider further ways to strengthen the fiscal framework.
To reduce possible fiscal risks due to liabilities incurred at the municipality level, the
authorities are also revising the framework for municipalities’ financing. The authorities see
potential for increasing wealth taxation, but it requires broad consensus and the exact
modalities need to be worked out. The government already proposed to change the valuation
method for the land tax, which would be based on the market value.
The structural expenditure reforms in social security, health care, and education sectors are
advancing. The final decision to increase the retirement age was taken in June and the
retirement age will be gradually increased from 2012. The Parliament also approved the
comprehensive pension reform guidelines that aim to strengthen the link between pension
benefits, demographic factors, and contributions. The authorities aim to complete the reform
of the pension system in 2012. The reform of the health care and education sector is
approaching a stage where the number of institutions providing health care and education
services will start to be consolidated. The authorities also expect to reinvigorate the housing
renovation program that will provide further impetus for employment and will yield
significant savings on the imported energy bill, improving the current account balance over
the medium-term.
The authorities underscore the significant transparency and efficiency gains they expect from
reforming the management of state owned enterprises (SOEs). The reform aims to enhance
efficiency of SOEs by setting higher requirements for financial reporting and accountability,
revising management structure, introducing more stringent cost-benefit analysis, and
separating SOEs commercial and non-commercial functions. The reform efforts should yield
considerably higher revenue. Based on the analysis of the available data on the SOEs
financial performance, also taking into account the proposed new rules for the SOEs profit
sharing, the draft 2012 budget includes 0.4 percent of GDP in additional revenue from SOEs.

Financial stability and financial sector policies
As the macroeconomic outlook has improved, the banks operating in Lithuania were able to
achieve higher net interest margins, the level of NPLs started to come down, and the
profitability of the banking system has increased. The Lithuanian banks rely on stable
sources of funding and hold sizeable liquidity buffers to withstand potential shocks. The
liquidity ratio made up 41.7 percent for 2011 Q3 and significantly exceeded the 30 percent
minimum established by the Bank of Lithuania. The share of retail deposits to total liabilities

4
has increased to 60.1 percent in September 2011 and the parent bank funding has decreased
to 30.6 percent of the total liabilities. The rigorous stress tests performed by the Bank of
Lithuania showed that even under the adverse scenario the banking system’s liquidity ratio
would remain close to the regulatory requirement. The capital adequacy ratio of the banking
system stood at 14.1 percent as of 2011 Q3, and substantially exceeded the regulatory capital
requirement of 8 percent. The banking system’s Tier 1 capital ratio increased from 10.9 to
11.2 percent over the year. However, some banks still need to increase loan loss provisioning
and strengthen the capital base. The banks operating in Lithuania have only limited direct
exposure to the sovereign debt of the Southern European countries with the spillovers that
effect demand for export and the conditions for sovereign financing considered being a more
important risk.
In 2011 the authorities advanced a number of important initiatives that will allow for further
strengthening of the systemic resilience in the financial sector:
1)
Seeking to achieve economies of scope in supervising Lithuania’s bank-based
financial system and to ensure better coordination and systemic risk management, the
authorities decided to consolidate the financial sector supervision under the Bank of
Lithuania. The reform foresees transferring the insurance and securities sector supervision
function to the central bank that will also assume responsibility to provide consumer
financial protection services. The reformed supervisory authority will report to the designated
member of the board of the Bank of Lithuania. The financial supervision function will be
financed from market participants’ contributions and the central bank’s resources. The
reform will enhance the institutional, political, operational, and financial independence in
carrying out the financial sector supervision. The necessary legal amendments have been
presented to the Parliament and should be passed into law by December 2011. The
operational preparedness to implement the foreseen reforms from the beginning of 2012 is
well advanced too.
2)
The prudential framework has been strengthened by adopting the Regulations
for Responsible Lending that established clear limits on loan-to-value, loan-to-income, loan
maturity, and strengthened the requirements for banks to inform customers about the
borrowing risks.
3)
Further progress has been made on operational preparedness for cross-border
crisis management. The Lithuanian authorities signed the Nordic-Baltic cooperation
agreement on cross-border financial stability, crisis management, and resolution and
participate in the Nordic-Baltic Cross-Border Stability Group, which was established to
implement the provisions of the agreement. The Lithuanian authorities continued
participation in the supervisory colleges established to supervise the cross-border banking
groups.
4)
With the help of the Fund’s technical assistance the authorities prepared the
law on natural persons’ bankruptcy that should be adopted by December 2011. The law will
enhance the insolvency regime by providing opportunities for orderly natural persons’ debt
restructuring.
