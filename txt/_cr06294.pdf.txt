The 2006 Article IV discussions were held in Damascus April 29–May 16, 2006. The
mission comprised Mrs. Moalla-Fetini (head), Messrs. Dridi and Hasan (all MCD),
Mr. Chua (FAD), Mr. Cossé (PDR), and Ms. Kargbo (staff assistant). Ms. Beidas-Strom
(Sr. Advisor to Executive Director) joined the policy discussions.

•

The team met with a wide range of senior officials and private sector representatives.
Senior officials included Minister Al-Hussein (Finance), Vice Prime Minister Dardari (in
Charge of Economic Affairs and Head of the State Planning Commission), Governor Mayaleh
(Central Bank of Syria), Minister Lotfi (Economy and Trade), Minister Allo (Petroleum and
Mineral Resources), and Minister Al-Kalaa (Tourism). The team also met representatives of
financial institutions, commerce and industrial federations.

•

Significant data weaknesses in terms of coverage, consistency, periodicity, and timeliness
remain. With the exception of notable improvement in the timeliness of fiscal data
(preliminary data for the 2005 fiscal outturn became available during the mission), progress in
addressing serious deficiencies in real sector and balance of payments (BOP) statistics has
been limited (poor quality trade statistics are available for the first six months of 2005 only,
and national account statistics suffer from methodological problems in their treatment of price
subsidies and in capturing the activity of the private sector). These weaknesses continue to
hamper staff’s ability to conduct effective surveillance and to monitor the economy’s response
to the ongoing reforms. Preparation for participation in the GDDS is ongoing.

•

The authorities have shown themselves responsive to previous Board recommendations.
They have continued to make progress in furthering reforms (Annex II), and the recently
adopted five-year plan reflects a deeper awareness of the medium-term challenges highlighted
during last year’s consultation (Annex I).

•

The authorities published the mission’s concluding statement.

•

Syria continues to avail itself of the transitional provisions of Article XIV, and maintains
exchange measures that are subject to the Fund’s approval under Article VIII. The
exchange rate regime is a multiple exchange rate system, with one official rate pegged to the
U.S. dollar and applying to most public sector transactions, another official rate frequently
adjusted to reflect movements in the free market rate and applying to a positive list of private
sector transactions, and a free market rate, which is floating although it has fluctuated almost
exclusively within +/-5 percent around a central parity of Syrian pound 51 per U.S. dollar over
the past ten years.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Recent developments and medium-term prospects
The economy proved quite resilient in the face of the unsettling political developments.
Economic activity picked up steam buoyed by private investment and supported by the oil boom
in the Gulf region. However, growth was accompanied by a rise in inflation, reflecting, in part,
an expansionary monetary policy. The non-oil budget balance improved significantly, although
mainly due to an increase in transfers from public enterprises (PEs). Similarly, the non-oil
current account balance improved, contributing to maintaining external balance despite the
sharp fall in net oil exports. Public and external debts remain moderate, and official reserves
cover close to two years of imports. In spite of the still volatile regional environment, the
recovery seems poised to continue in 2006, supported by stronger private investment.
The surge in international oil prices has provided a short-term windfall but will aggravate the
medium-term outlook when Syria becomes a net oil importer around the year 2010. Based on
the latest projections for oil output, staff estimates that budgetary oil revenues and net oil
exports will deteriorate by more than 10 percentage points of GDP in the next ten years.
Cognizant of the adverse medium-term prospects, the authorities’ recently adopted Five-Year
Plan (FYP) outlines a comprehensive strategy to address these challenges, which is broadly in
line with Fund policy advice.
Policy discussions and key recommendations
Against this background, discussions focused on near-term policy adjustment to rein in
inflation and on fleshing out the reform agenda in critical areas where action is needed in the
next 1–2 years:
•

Sustaining the investment-led recovery will hinge critically on unwavering progress in
deepening structural reforms to improve the investment climate. Controlling inflation calls
for a tighter monetary stance and a restrained wage policy.

•

The magnitude of the fiscal adjustment needed to address the fall in oil revenues over the
medium term requires a fundamental fiscal reform. Introducing a VAT and phasing out
petroleum price subsidies (PPS) should be its main pillars.

•

Based on the broad-based political support for exchange rate unification and following the
adoption of a law to legalize foreign exchange bureaus, the central bank should finalize
preparations to start an interbank foreign exchange market and strengthen capacity to
intervene in the unified market to prevent excessive volatility and maintain a competitive
rate.

•

Accelerating financial sector and trade liberalization, and forging ahead with legal and
institutional reforms to lower the cost of doing business and strengthen competition will be
critical to strengthen the medium-term outlook and achieve the FYP’s 7 percent growth
target.

4
I. INTRODUCTION AND KEY ISSUES
1.
Syria faces daunting economic challenges. The decline of oil reserves poses a threat
to fiscal and external sustainability, and the associated fall in oil revenues will make it harder
to preserve, much less improve living standards. A bulge in labor market entrants will strain
an already precarious unemployment situation and increase pressure to protect redundant
labor in an overstaffed public sector. These challenges are further compounded by political
uncertainties and a volatile regional environment. The political environment, which had
deteriorated in the aftermath of the assassination of Lebanese Prime Minister Hariri, has now
stabilized. The mandate of the UN commission investigating the assassination has been
extended to June 2007, warding off the immediate threat of UN sanctions.
2.
In this context, the recent surge in oil prices has been a mixed blessing. The
immediate impact has been to provide windfall revenues and allow economic activity to
strengthen, benefiting from strong growth and abundant liquidity in the Gulf region. At the
same time, higher oil prices will impose a heavier burden on the balance of payments and
raise costs for producers and consumers—if they are passed through—or, otherwise, on
public finances when Syria becomes a net oil importer in the next 3–4 years. Based on the
latest oil output projections, staff estimates that the proceeds from net oil exports will swing
from a surplus of 3½ percent of GDP in 2006 to a deficit of about 10 percent in 2015. And,
unless petroleum price subsidies (PPS) are curtailed, net oil budgetary revenues would also
become increasingly negative compared to the 10 percentage points of GDP they now
contribute to the fiscal accounts (Figure 1).1

1

Net budgetary revenues from oil are equal to the oil production valued at international prices (net of
production costs) minus the net subsidies on the domestic consumption of petroleum products (Table 7, shows a
budget presentation making PPS explicit).

3.
Cognizant of the adverse medium-term prospects, the authorities’ recently
adopted FYP seeks to tackle the looming fiscal and balance of payment shock. It outlines
a comprehensive stabilization and structural reform strategy,2 broadly in line with Fund
policy recommendations during last year’s Article IV consultation. Moreover, an action plan
specifying concrete policy measures for the next two years has just been finalized. Slow but
steady progress continues to be made in furthering reforms, most notably on tariff reduction,3
as per the commitment under the yet-to-be-ratified Syria/EU Association Agreement
(Syria/EUAA).4
4.
•

Against this background, discussions focused on two areas:
near-term policy adjustment to address rising inflation; and

•

the medium-term reform agenda, with particular attention to the critical areas where
policy action is needed in the next 1–2 years, including the adoption of a fiscal
consolidation strategy—centered around phasing out PPS and introducing a VAT—as
well as exchange rate unification.
II. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
A. Recent Developments, Outlook, and Near-Term Policy Adjustment

Growth and external balance
•

Developments: Non-oil GDP growth may have risen to about 5½ percent in 2005,
from 5 percent in 2004, buoyed by business investment and supported by household
consumption and non-oil exports (Table 1).5 Assuming a much smaller
implementation rate than historically, the surge in investment approvals in 2004
(200 percent) would have led to a strong rise in actual investment (equivalent to close
to 5 percent of non-oil GDP). Private consumption was boosted by rapid credit
growth, a boom in real estate prices triggered by capital inflows, and the large wage
increase from mid-2004. In addition, strong economic activity in the Gulf region and
abundant liquidity boosted exports and the demand for investment opportunities.
Overall, net non-oil exports contributed positively to growth and to an improvement
in the non-oil current account deficit, thereby helping to maintain external balance
despite the sharp decline in net oil exports (Table 2).6

See Annex I for an overview of the FYP macroeconomic objectives, strategies, and supporting reforms.

3

For a list of reforms implemented since the last Article IV consultation see Annex II.

4

The agreement was signed by Syria in late 2004, but the EU council has yet to approve it.

5

Overall growth was limited to 3 percent, given the decline in oil production. The latter is, to a large extent, an
exogenous variable, and has negligible impact on employment.
6

The decline in net oil exports was due to the fall in production, and was further compounded by increased
smuggling, as price differentials with neighboring countries widened.

8
•

The outlook for 2006 is fairly positive. The non-oil GDP growth momentum is
expected to be sustained by robust investment expansion7 and good export
performance, reflecting greater access to regional Arab markets and the benefits from
the concerted policy to promote tourism. This, together with the windfall from higher
oil prices and an increase in foreign direct investment (FDI), will maintain a
comfortable BOP position. However, a slowdown in the pace of economic reforms
could dampen investors’ interest and the prevailing political uncertainties will remain
a source of vulnerability.

•

The authorities were encouraged to see that the implementation of their
broad-based reforms elicited a positive supply response. In their view, Syrian and
other Arab investors felt that a point of no return in reform has been reached.
Furthermore, they welcomed strong interest from domestic and foreign investors
toward the newly opened banking and insurance sectors. On the outlook for 2006,
they were confident that the economy will continue to improve as investors’
confidence in the sustainability of reforms strengthens. They view the risks from the
lingering political uncertainty with great concern.

Inflation and monetary policy
•

Developments: The economic recovery since 2004 has been accompanied by
a steady rise in inflation. Several factors have contributed including: an
expansionary monetary stance (with credit to the private sector growing by some
45 percent (Tables 3 and 4), the depreciation of the exchange rate around the time of
the confidence crisis in September–December (see below); large public sector wage
increases in mid-2004, and an increase in commodity import prices.

After tripling in 2004, investment approvals increased by another 80 percent in 2005. About 30 percent of

in 2004.

•

Outlook/recommendations: Although recent inflation data point to some
improvement, further reductions in inflation are likely to require tighter monetary and
income policies. To this end, credit ceilings, which are still the main instrument of
monetary control, should

policy, pressures to grant further wage increases should be resisted, as the 12 percent
across-the-board public sector wage increase in early 2006 already carries a nonnegligible inflation risk.

•

The authorities viewed the rise in inflation with concern and agreed that the
rapid credit growth had played a role. They also noted other one-off factors—such
as stockpiling of food supplies in anticipation of UN sanctions. They pointed to the
recent evidence of moderating inflation and said that any remaining concerns are
being addressed by measures to tighten credit policy.9

Exchange rate policy
•

Developments: Following a
successful intervention to alleviate
pressure on the exchange rate, the
Syrian pound has appreciated in
recent months. The central bank
took a number of measures
including raising interest rates,
relaxing some foreign exchange
restrictions, and intervening in the
parallel market, to deal with the
pressures on the exchange rate

Seen against the 2¾ percent increase in U.S. dollar interest rates since January 2005, the increase in Syrian

triggered by the politically-driven confidence crisis. The appreciation of the free

likely underlying strengthening of the balance of payments.
Outlook/recommendations: The current level of the real exchange rate appears
broadly appropriate. Price competitiveness is about 20 percent better than in the early
2000s (Figure 2),

•

The authorities agreed on the need for a proactive exchange rate policy in the
future, but preferred to refrain from intervening until after unification, as the current
strength of the currency creates the right political economy conditions for exchange
rate unification (see below).

Over the past few years, corporate taxes have displayed great volatility around a stable level of about
3½ percent of GDP.

13

•

Outlook/recommendations: The 2006 budget, together with subsequent measures,
are expected to yield close to ½ percentage point improvement in the underlying
fiscal position.11 This would reflect 1 percentage point of GDP yield from the
increase in the price of cement and gasoline, half of which was eroded by wage
increases in February. Together with the modest increase in oil revenues due to the
rise in international prices, this tightening should narrow the overall deficit to
3¼ percent of GDP and limit the inflationary and crowding out impact of its domestic
financing. Given the strengthening of the economy, the adjustment in 2006 should
have been more ambitious and, at a minimum, should not be eroded by further wage
increases.

•

The authorities agreed that the sustainability of the surge in PE surpluses is hard to
ascertain given the weak accounting standards in PEs, and that this, therefore,
represents a fiscal risk. They expressed satisfaction with the corporate tax take, which
despite a significant reduction in the top marginal rate (from 65 to 35), did not
decline, suggesting buoyant profits and some success in combating tax evasion. On
wage policy, the authorities stressed the strong pressures to increase wages and said
that a further increase could not be ruled out, particularly in view of the prospective
reform of PPS.
B. Addressing Medium-Term Challenges

5.
Although pleased with the recent improvement of the economy, the authorities
are increasingly concerned with the considerable risks involved in delaying adjustment
and in postponing structural reforms. The huge surge in the oil import bill, up from
negligible amounts in a not-too-distant past, drove home the reality that current policies and
most notably PPS are unsustainable. This has strengthened the political will to undertake
reforms and that is helpful. However, the authorities are facing difficult challenges in their
drive to accelerate reforms stemming from severe capacity constraints and the absence of
social safety nets to mitigate the impact of reforms. Political uncertainties and outside
pressures add to the complexity of the challenges.12 Against this background, discussions

11

The non-oil budget balance reflected in Table 6 shows a deterioration of 0.1 percent of GDP. However, a
0.6 percent of GDP additional increase in revenue resulting from an increase in the price of domestic gasoline,
which is counted in oil-related proceeds, should be added to the non-oil balance for a proper assessment of the
extent of the fiscal adjustment.
12

U.S. financial institutions are required since February 2006 to terminate all correspondent accounts involving
the Commercial Bank of Syria (CBoS) over concerns about “its involvement in money laundering and terrorism
financing”. A number of European banks have followed suit. This is creating difficulties for the public sector to
execute international transactions, which were previously handled by the CBoS. Syria was assessed by
MENAFATF, the FATF style regional body for the Middles East and North Africa region, in May 2006 for

focused on fiscal consolidation, exchange rate unification, and trade and financial
liberalization. The authorities also highlighted the legal and institutional reforms underway to
improve the investment climate and enhance competition.
Consolidating public finances
•

Fiscal policy framework: The FYP aims to contain the overall budget deficit
below 5 percent of GDP and to limit public debt to no more than 45 percent of
GDP by 2010.13 Although the new forward-looking orientation in fiscal policy
is welcome, setting the main objective in terms of the overall budget balance
does not guard against the risk that no adjustment takes place, should oil
revenues turn out to be more frontloaded than anticipated. A more suitable anchor
would be a steady improvement in the non-oil budget balance.14 Moreover, a
7 percentage point of GDP increase in public debt over five years—as envisaged in
the plan—would not be prudent, as room should be left to accommodate contingent
liabilities, such as the cost of bank restructuring.15 The authorities noted that the
7 percent of GDP increase in public debt should not be seen as a target but as an
upper limit with room to maneuver, should the social conditions require it.

•

Composition of adjustment: The required fiscal adjustment calls for major fiscal
reforms. Introducing a VAT and reforming PPS should be its main pillars:16
¾

VAT: With a tax-to-GDP ratio equal to 10½ percent of GDP, increasing taxes
is paramount for the government to continue to provide basic services once oil
revenues taper off. Although improving tax administration can help, this has
limited potential. A well-designed VAT could bring additional revenues
equivalent to 5 percent of GDP—if levied at a rate of 15 percent.17 Although
the authorities have committed to introducing a VAT by early 2008, the tax
administration reform needed to support it is proceeding slowly, in particular
the preparation for introducing self-assessment and the opening of a first large

compliance with the FATF 40+9 Recommendations. The results will be discussed at an upcoming MENAFATF
meeting.
13

Given the projected decline in oil revenues, this would imply a 5–6 percentage points of GDP improvement
in the non-oil budget balance during 2006–10.

14

See IMF Country Report 05/356 and Chapter I of the background paper.

15

In particular, the cost of past quasi-fiscal activities of supporting cotton and cereal production, which was
born by state banks, may be high. See chapter III of the background paper.

taxpayers’ unit. Also, critical choices as to the design of the VAT have yet to
be made.

18

¾

PPS: With most expenditure items at fairly moderate levels and some (such as
social assistance, education and health) underfunded, phasing out PPS, whose
cost is estimated to surge to 14½ percent of GDP in 2006, would be an
essential reform. Beyond large fiscal savings, it would provide significant
efficiency gains, improve equity, entail a smaller negative fiscal impulse, and
contribute to BOP adjustment18 and higher long-term growth. A government
working group has undertaken a comprehensive analysis and has sought
international experts’ advice including from the World Bank. Under
consideration is a proposal that would: (i) focus the reform initially on the
price of diesel (the most subsidized product); (ii) close 60 percent of the gap
vis-à-vis international prices upfront, and phase in the remaining adjustment
by 2010; and (iii) in the absence of a poverty map and means-testing
mechanisms, return to households a certain share of the gross fiscal gains in
the form of a flat per person cash compensation, at least initially.

¾

The authorities pointed out that significant capacity constraints are
hampering progress in tax administration reform, but they still expected
to overcome these obstacles and meet the 2008 target for the VAT. They
reiterated their determination to phase in the PPS reform at the earliest
opportunity. They were in broad agreement with the main elements of the
above proposal, although there is still a debate on the merits of the proposed
flat cash compensation versus other compensating measures.

The impact of increasing petroleum prices will fall disproportionately more on the demand for petroleum
products, minimizing the demand contraction for other goods and generating a greater oil surplus for export.
Phasing out PPS will also reduce pervasive smuggling.

16

Prospects: Staff prepared an illustrative scenario to show that these two key reforms
could go a long way to delivering the FYP’s fiscal consolidation goals (Tables 8, 9,
and 10).19 Under this scenario,

In the absence of fiscal adjustment and structural reforms, the widening macroeconomic imbalances would
lead to a build up of public debt, rising interest rates, crowding out of private investment, low growth, and a
combination of either/or a depreciation-cum-inflation spiral or a rapid loss of official reserves. See IMF Country
Report 05/356.

20

The latter has been calibrated such that the reform would make 50 percent of the population better off,
striking a balance between fiscal savings and political acceptability. Chapter II of the background paper
discusses why the calibration of the PPS reform has to be a function of the level of international oil prices and
why a lower price environment would call for a more front-loaded price adjustment and lower cash
compensation.

Exchange rate unification and current account convertibility
•

Encouraging steps were taken recently towards exchange rate unification and
current account convertibility, including further relaxation of foreign exchange
restrictions, and the adoption of a law to legalize foreign exchange bureaus and a
regulation setting limits on banks’ open exchange position.21 Given the low spread
between official and parallel market rates, the attendant risks appear limited.

•

The authorities stated that there was now broad political consensus in support of
exchange rate unification and that the timing was right given the strengthening of
the currency. The onus is now on the central bank to finalize the preparatory work to
launch an interbank foreign exchange market. The authorities agreed with staff that
continuing to manage the exchange rate tightly will serve Syria well in the near term,
as greater exchange rate volatility could dampen trade flows, given the lack of
hedging instruments, and could weaken the role of the exchange rate as a nominal
anchor. At the same time, the authorities agreed that greater flexibility will be needed
in the future to facilitate adjustment of the real exchange rate, which may well be
required, given the prospective depletion of oil reserves and further trade
liberalization.

21

See Annex III for a description of Syria’s exchange rate regime.

18

Financial sector development
•

Developments/issues: The authorities’ strategy to develop the financial sector by
opening it to private initiative was successful in attracting and expanding private
banking activities. Five banks have already gained 10 percent market share and some
have decided to increase their capital base. Three additional banks are expected to
open in 2006, one of which is the first Islamic bank. Prospects for further
development of a thriving and profitable private banking sector to meet the needs of a
growing economy seem promising. However, the banking system is still dominated
by state banks, which are undercapitalized, unprofitable, and saddled with large
non-performing loans. The latter problem may have worsened by the recent
fast-paced credit expansion.22 Lack of progress in restructuring state banks will hinder
interest rate liberalization and the development of deep and liquid money markets. It
will stifle competition, and would ultimately increase the cost of an eventual
restructuring.23 This, together with the rapid credit growth, calls for the need to
strengthen bank supervision and adopt a prudent licensing policy, and to restructure
state banks.

•

The authorities are confident that adequate banking supervision capacity is being
built up, thanks to the technical assistance provided by the Fund. They agreed on the
need to carry out detailed independent audits before deciding on specific restructuring
options.24 Although they recognize the merits of inviting strategic investors to take an
equity share in some of these banks, they indicated that mergers were not excluded.
The authorities also noted that the soon-to-be-launched stock exchange is another
milestone in their program to deepen financial intermediation.

Trade liberalization and other structural reforms
6.
Trade liberalization, market deregulation, and improving the business climate
are key elements of the authorities’ reform agenda. To this effect, further progress was
made in lowering tariffs, removing import bans (textile and cement), eliminating import
licenses (raw materials), opening markets to the private sector (cement and electricity),
streamlining procedures, and reducing transaction costs. Despite this progress, the trade
regime remains complex and quite restrictive. Staff encouraged the authorities to lower nontariff barriers and stressed the importance of addressing other structural rigidities that affect

the investment climate.25 The authorities noted, in particular, the move to open the textile
sector to international competition and felt confident that this is the way to go to diversify
Syria’s export base and create new engines of growth.26 They also noted that the system of
industrial quotas allowing imports at lower customs rates will be eliminated soon. They
agreed on the need for greater transparency about remaining trade restrictions and committed
to an early publication of the tariff schedule and the negative lists, and for phasing them out
gradually, even if this may imply anticipating the formal implementation of the Syria/EUAA.
Furthermore, key economic regulations (company, commerce, and competition laws) will be
adopted soon.
Statistical issues
7.
The authorities acknowledged the severe data weaknesses and noted the increase in
budget allocation and the decision to participate in the GDDS to address these weaknesses.
They are hopeful that the GDDS framework will be a vehicle to raise the statistical system’s
standards, including by mobilizing additional technical assistance.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
8.
The Syrian economy withstood the increase in political uncertainties and
maintained forward momentum. This achievement has been supported by the oil boom in
the Gulf region and the related increased demand for investment opportunities. However, it
also owes much to the steady progress in implementing reforms aimed at encouraging private
entrepreneurship, promoting market mechanisms, opening the economy, and liberalizing the
financial system. This progress is starting to bear fruit and private investment, which had
stagnated at very low levels in the past, is now showing much greater vitality.
9.
Although the short-term outlook and positive supply response are encouraging,
formidable challenges remain. The surge in international oil prices has provided a
short-term windfall, but will worsen the medium-term prospects when Syria becomes a net
oil importer in the next 3–4 years. Greater vigilance is, therefore, needed in pursuing fiscal
consolidation within a transparent policy framework aiming at a steady improvement in the
non-oil budget balance. Accelerating structural reforms to enhance the incentives for the
private sector to invest and the capability of the financial sector to intermediate will be
critical to creating new sources of growth and income to replace the waning oil wealth.

25

Chapter IV of the background paper take stock of progress to date in trade liberalization and discusses further
liberalization measures.

26

Chapter V of the background paper assesses the potential of the textile sector to be a main driver of non-oil
export growth.

20

10.
A sizable fiscal adjustment will be needed to preserve fiscal solvency. Although,
the level of public debt is relatively moderate, additional borrowing to ease the impact of
fiscal consolidation should be limited, given the possible need to accommodate the cost of
contingent liabilities, such as the possibly large cost of bank restructuring. A front-loaded
adjustment will do much to boost market confidence and should be made easier by the
economic conjuncture.
11.
Introducing a VAT and phasing out PPS should be the main pillars of a progrowth fiscal reform. A broad-based VAT is one of the most efficient taxes, with a
significant revenue-raising potential, and limited impact on production and investment.
Removing PPS and replacing them with a flat cash compensation could generate large fiscal
savings, enhance equity and efficiency, and promote long-term growth by protecting
spending on education, health, and infrastructure. Putting in place efficient social safety nets
will be essential to achieve the authorities’ goal to accelerate the transition to a “social”
market economy. In their absence, concerns about social equity may block reforms and will
continue to be met by distorting the tax and pricing systems.
12.
Both reforms are politically and operationally challenging and steadfast
progress in preparing to launch them is essential. A far-reaching tax administration
reform is needed to underpin the VAT and improve the efficiency of other taxes. The aim
should be a modern tax administration, based on self assessment, with fully automated
business processes, risk-based compliance programs, and skilled and professional staff, all
contributing to an environment characterized by fairness, honesty, and transparency. The
capacity constraints that have hindered progress thus far need to be addressed as a matter of
priority. The challenges in designing and implementing the compensation scheme for PPS
reform and in sustaining the adjustment effort over four years should not be underestimated.
13.
The recent steps toward exchange rate unification and current account
convertibility and the political consensus in favor of unification are welcome. The central
bank should now accelerate preparations to launch the interbank foreign exchange market
and develop the technical capacity to intervene to reduce excessive volatility and maintain a
competitive rate. Although the level of the real exchange rate appears broadly appropriate, its
recent strengthening should be monitored carefully in view of the prospective decline in oil
exports and the need to promote non-oil exports.
14.
To nurture the development of an open, competitive, and resilient financial
sector, the authorities’ attention should remain focused on strengthening bank
supervision and on restructuring state banks. Steady progress in strengthening bank
regulation and supervision and banks’ accounting standards and in carefully screening entry
of new banks will be critical to protect the soundness of the banking system. Structural
weaknesses of state banks will slow the process of interest rate liberalization and the
development of deep and liquid money markets with detrimental impact on the efficiency of
financial intermediation and the growth of private banks. Independent audits should be
undertaken before deciding on restructuring strategies. Staff encourages the authorities to
consider the merits of opening the capital of some of these banks to strategic investors and of

21

liquidating significantly under-capitalized and low-franchise-value banks. Mergers might be
fraught with risks. In all cases, the government should be prepared to deal boldly with the
required restructuring measures, including their related costs.
15.
Despite significant progress, the trade system remains non transparent and
relatively restrictive, and the cost of doing business in Syria is still very high.
Eliminating key nontariff barriers should be the first priority and will strongly signal the
authorities’ determination to address the trade agenda. Implementing the regulatory measures
under the Syria/EUAA will bode well for the future and help progress toward observing
WTO rules and disciplines. By implementing this agenda, Syria will gain in credibility as a
full-fledged trading partner, will establish a solid track record in shifting toward an open
economy, and will boost its potential for a much needed insertion into the global economy.
16.
A top priority should be given to improving the quality and timeliness of
economic statistics, including indicators of short-term activity. Staff welcomes the
authorities’ decision to participate in the GDDS and hopes that this will give a much needed
impetus to a far reaching revamping of Syria’s statistical infrastructure.
17.
Syria continues to maintain exchange restrictions under Article XIV, Section 2
(Appendix I). The staff urges the authorities to eliminate these restrictions as soon as its
balance of payments position permits. Syria also maintains exchange measures subject to
approval under Article VIII (Appendix I). Absent specific measures to eliminate these
exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices in a timely manner, the staff does not
recommend that the Executive Board grant approval of their retention. The staff urges the
authorities to eliminate these restrictions and multiple currency practices without delay.
18.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard
12-month cycle.

1/ Indicate coverage of public sector, e.g., general government or nonfinancial public sector. Also whether net or gross debt is used.
2/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; a
= share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

U.S. dollar terms, g = real GDP growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total
external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic
currency (e > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).

Exchange Rate Arrangement:

The exchange system in Syria is characterized by multiple exchange rates and a foreign
exchange market segmented into public and private sector pools. The private sector has
almost no access to the official pool, sourced by public sector foreign exchange revenues
channeled through the Commercial Bank of Syria, and conducts its transactions on an
unofficial parallel market located in Syria and offshore, sourced by foreign exchange from
tourism, workers’ remittances, proceeds from unrecorded exports, and private capital
inflows. Under the multiple rate structure, there are two official rates pegged to the dollar and
one unofficial (market determined) rate. The parallel market rate for the Syrian pound in
1

Under the Eleventh General Review.

41

other countries in the region averaged about LS/$52.3 in 2004 and about LS/$54.3 in 2005.
Most private sector transactions take place at this rate.
VIII. Article IV Consultations:
Syria is on the annual consultation cycle. The last consultation was held in April/May 2005
and was completed on August 31, 2005.
IX.

Article XIV Restrictions:

Syria continues to maintain, under Article XIV, restrictions on payments and transfers for
current international transactions, including administrative allocation of foreign exchange.
Syria also maintains exchange measures that are subject to Fund approval under Article VIII:
(i) prohibition against purchases by private parties of foreign exchange from the banking
system for some current international transactions; (ii) a multiple currency practice resulting
from divergences of more than 2 percent between the official exchange rate and officially
recognized exchange rates; (iii) a non-interest-bearing advance import deposit requirement of
75–100 percent for public sector imports as well as private sector imports which are not
financed from abroad; and (iv) an exchange restriction arising from the net debt under
inoperative bilateral payments arrangements with the Islamic Republic of Iran, and
Sri Lanka.
The Executive Board adopted the decision No. 13554-(05/75) at a Board meeting on August
31, 2005:
1.
The Fund takes this decision relating to the Syrian Arab Republic’s exchange
measures subject to Article VIII, Section 2(a) and 3, and in concluding the 2005 Article XIV
consultation with the Syrian Arab Republic, in the light of the 2005 Article IV consultations
with the Syrian Arab Republic concluded under Decision No. 5392- (77/63) adopted on April
29, 1977, as amended (surveillance over Exchange Rate Policies).
2.
The Syrian Arab Republic maintains restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers for current international transactions in accordance with Article XIV, Section 2, as
described in the IMF Country Report 05/356. In addition, as described in the IMF Country
Report 05/356, the Syrian Arab Republic maintains measures subject to approval under
Article VIII. The Fund encourages the Syrian Arab Republic to eliminate the restrictions
maintained under Article XIV, Section 2 as soon as its balance of payments permits, and to
eliminate the measures that are subject to approval under Article VIII as soon as possible.

Appendix II. Syrian Arab Republic: Relations with the World Bank Group
(End-March 2006)
1.
In June 2002, Syria settled its overdue service payments to IBRD and IDA, which had
risen to the equivalent of $526 million as of mid-1997, and all loans and credits were restored
to accrual status. Consequently, the country’s eligibility for disbursements was reinstated as
of July 1, 2002.
2.
Subsequent to the agreement on arrears in July 1997, the World Bank began to
provide non-lending services to Syria. Initial activities included support for the Ministry of
Finance and the Central Bank of Syria in accounting and the establishment of an external
debt management system in the form of grants from the Institutional Development Fund;
planning and implementation grants supporting Year 2000 remediation efforts; the Global
Environment Fund biodiversity project; and reviews of the trade regime (including export
promotion), health, roads, urban water and sanitation, and agricultural irrigation sectors.
3.
In the last two years, the authorities have continued to request only non-lending
support from the Bank. Analytical services have focused mainly on the trade and investment
agenda. A trade policy report entitled “Harnessing Trade for Growth” was submitted to the
Authorities in December 2004. A Trade Logistics study was completed in 2003, and
discussed in a large workshop with the private sector in December 2003. An Investment
Climate Assessment survey was carried out in 2003 and 2004, and its result have been
finalized in a report dated June, 2005. The World Bank has also initiated a grant activity
(from April 2005) in collaboration with the Fund and the UNDP to establish a National
Statistical Capacity Strategy.
4.
The Bank program over the next 3 years will be based mainly on knowledge transfer
and analytical services focusing on two pillars: (i) economic reform and transition; and
(ii) human development and social protection.
•

On the first pillar, the program will build on the substantial analytical and survey
work done in the last year that resulted in two trade reports and in the forthcoming
Investment Climate Assessment report that will be presented to the authorities. The
Bank will provide both analytical advice and technical assistance to the Authorities in
their search for a solid and global strategy of economic growth and transition to
private sector-led economy. This would imply integrating within the existing trade
and investment agenda issues linked to fiscal and monetary policy, financial sector
reform, and public enterprise reforms.

•

On the second pillar, the Bank will be focusing on assisting the Authorities in
(i) developing a comprehensive education sector strategy as agreed with the Minster
of Education; (ii) understanding the labor market and designing appropriate policies

44

and programs, and (iii) assessing their social assistance programs and policies and
providing recommendations on reforming the system.

IFC has been active in Syria since 1999 when the Board approved the corporation’s
first investment in the country—a $1 million equity stake in a manufacturer of drip irrigation
systems. Since that time, IFC has made two other investments, including an equity position
in the first private sector bank in Syria and a loan to a chemicals company. The total held
portfolio is $20.2 million. IFC has also conducted technical assistance work, including
studies of aspects of the financial sector.

Appendix III. Syrian Arab Republic: Statistical Issues
1.
The macroeconomic statistics are affected by weaknesses in coverage, consistency,
periodicity, and timeliness, which hamper the staff’s ability to conduct economic analysis
and effective surveillance. Efforts should be directed to address weaknesses in national
accounts, government finance, monetary and financial, and balance of payments statistics.
2.
In the context of Article IV missions, Syrian representatives have expressed an
intention to address the need for statistical improvement. They have agreed that Syria’s
participation in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) would provide a framework
for statistical development. To this end, compilers from the Ministry of Finance,
Central Bank of Syria (CBS), and the Central Bureau of Statistics participated in a GDDS
Workshop in Abu Dhabi during February 27-March 9, 2005 and prepared preliminary
metadata for all macroeconomic sectors. In addition, the authorities have appointed a GDDS
coordinator. A draft description of institutional frameworks, data sources, compilation
methods, and data dissemination practices (metadata) for Syria’s fiscal, financial, and
external sector data was sent to Syria’s GDDS Coordinator in May 2006 with a request to
review and complete the missing information. On May 30, 2006, the draft metadata were
transmitted to the GDDS coordinator to be updated, clarified where needed, and to include
the missing information.
3.

Statistical issues in various sectors of the economy are discussed below.
A. Real Sector

4.
A series of Statistics Department (STA) and Middle East Technical Assistance Center
(METAC) national accounts and price statistics missions over the period 2005-early 2006
found that the Central Bureau of Statistics has made steady progress implementing prior STA
recommendations and updating the base year for the national accounts to 2000. However the
following weaknesses still exist:
•

GDP estimates by the production approach suffer from under-coverage of activities,
particularly in private services while free zone activities are not covered;

•

Syria has a multiple exchange rate system. This imposes implicit indirect taxes and
subsidies that can affect GDP and other national accounts aggregates. Currently, no
adjustments are made to accounts for these factors;

•

estimates of household final consumption expenditures are residually determined and
include the change in inventories, as the latter is not estimated separately. The
authorities have begun to make use of the 2004 Household Income and Expenditure
Survey and to collect data on inventory changes in the public sector;

46

•

consumption of fixed capital is estimated as a constant ratio of output;

•

net income flows between residents and nonresidents derived from the balance of
payments are unsatisfactory. As a result, the estimates of saving, investment, and net
borrowing from abroad are unreliable;

•

consumer price index calculations are nonstandard. Prices for each month are
compared to the same month of the base year; and there are four weighing schemes,
one for each quarter. Consequently, no month-on-month inflation can be derived, and
the annual average inflation is not equal to the sum of the monthly indices. However,
improvements are imminent following technical assistance provided by METAC; and

•

the wholesale price index is compiled and reported annually, but it is not
representative of market determined prices, as most prices are for goods and services
provided by public sector enterprises.

5.
The latest national accounts figures reported for publication in the International
Finance Statistics (IFS) refer to 2002, although the Central Bureau of Statistics published
more recent data in its Statistical Abstract.
B. Government Finance
•

Syria’s government finance statistics (GFS) suffer from major deficiencies with
respect to definitions, coverage, classification, methodology, accuracy, reliability, and
timeliness that generate severe inconsistencies with monetary and balance of
payments statistics. The multisector mission of June 2004 found that compilation of
GFS by the MOF is adversely affected by cumbersome institutional arrangements,
inadequate resource availability and unresolved methodological problems. The
methodology used for compilation does not follow either GFSM 2001 or GFSM 1986.
While budget data are available with very long lags (two years for final budget
accounts), financing data are not available. There is no dissemination of GFS data,
and even access to key data sources by GFS compilers within the MOF, such as the
breakdown of debt service into interest and amortization, is problematic. This
contributes to discrepancies in external financing as reported in the budget and the
balance of payment statistics.

•

The largest, most persistent and volatile discrepancies are between the financing
requirements of the budget, as reported by the MOF, and government financing as
reported by the CBS. The lack of a common and regularly updated coverage of the
government sector between the MOF and the CBS, misclassification of public
enterprises investment expenditure, as well as timing and valuation issues, are mainly
responsible for those discrepancies.

47

•

Other discrepancies between fiscal and monetary accounts relate to the unorthodox
treatment by the CBS of some transactions with government, such as the parallel rise
of government deposits and claims on government in the CBS balance sheet, which is
likely due to government withdrawals being counted as credit and never netted out
against deposits, and profits transferred to government treated as permanent claim on
the government.

•

To address the methodological issues, the June 2004 multisector mission developed a
preliminary bridge table that maps the budgetary source data codes to the GFSM 2001
classification codes, and conducted a seminar to clarify various aspects of the GFSM
2001 methodology to the MOF officials. To help the Directorate of Planning and
Statistics (DPS) implement a proper sectorization scheme, the mission provided an
updated institutional table showing the current coverage of government and public
enterprises―the investment expenditure of public enterprises is included in
government’s capital expenditure―for circulation to all relevant agencies. Moreover,
the mission formulated a detailed work plan centered around the provision of
adequate resources and training for the DPS to fulfill its tasks. The work plan calls for
the DPS to access core source data necessary for compilation―initially on a cash
basis―of annual GFS data according to the GFSM 2001, and for the resumption of
data reporting to STA for publication in GFSY and IFS, together with improved
reporting, in terms of coverage and classification, to the IMF’s Middle East and
Central Asia Department (MCD). The mission also recommended improvement in the
timeliness of annual data, including data on financing, and a start on the compilation
of sub-annual data.

•

Syria stopped reporting annual fiscal data for publication in the Government Finance
Statistics Yearbook. The latest data reported are for 1999. Moreover, the reported data
are partial, overly aggregated, in part misclassified, and do not include extrabudgetary and social security accounts. No data on financing and debt are provided.

48

C. Monetary Accounts
6.
Monetary statistics suffer from major deficiencies which hamper the staff’s ability to
conduct meaningful analysis of monetary developments. The multisector statistics mission in
June 2004 found that while the format of monetary statistics is largely consistent with the
structure of recommended MFSM sectoral surveys, the institutional coverage of monetary
statistics is incomplete, and there are deficiencies in the source data arising from, inter alia,
(i) the use of different exchange rates at the CBS and at the other banks for valuing their
foreign positions; (ii) financial positions are not valued at market prices or market-price
equivalents; (iii) a number of accounting procedures for the maintenance of public sector
accounts cause distortions in the measurement of gross positions; (iv) recently established
private banks as well as banks and bank branches operating in the Free Zones are excluded
from the coverage of monetary survey; and (v) there are disparities between the institutional
coverage of public sector in monetary statistics and the government finance statistics.
7.
To address the source data deficiencies, the June 2004 multisector mission
recommended: (a) the use of a market exchange rate for valuing all foreign currency
denominated positions at all banks, including the central bank, or as an intermediate step, the
use of a single rate closest to the market rate for valuing all foreign currency positions at the
CBS and at the other banks, (b) valuation of financial positions based on market prices or
market price equivalents; (c) inclusion of recently established private banks as well as banks
and bank branches operating in the Free Zones in the coverage of the monetary survey; and
(d) full adoption of the residency principle based on the center of economic interest. Further,
the accounting procedures for the maintenance of public administrative sector’s current
accounts and the classification of the CBS’ profit advances to the government should be
revised to an outstanding stock basis (for example, by ensuring that the deposit accounts are
debited for any checks presented instead of the check amount treated as an advance and
credited to a claim on the check issuer). The institutional lists for public administrative and
economic sectors should be updated for consistency with the recommendations for the
government finance statistics made by the mission, and these lists should be used as the basis
for collecting data and compiling monetary accounts.
8.
Monthly monetary data for the IFS are reported with a considerable lag, only very
recently reduced to about six months.
D. Balance of Payments
9.
Annual balance of payments statistics are compiled by the CBS on a provisional basis
with about an eight-month lag. As of April 2006, the latest balance of payments statistics
reported for publication in the IFS refer to 2004. Trade data are compiled monthly by the
Customs Department and reported quarterly by the Central Bureau of Statistics in local
currency units with a six-month lag. The BOP is presented in BPM5 format, but its

49

compilation method is not entirely consistent with the BPM5 methodology. The June 2004
STA mission observed the following weaknesses:
•

Private transfers do not fully reflect remittances by Syrians working abroad. The
statistics in the BOP for official transfers differ significantly from figures provided
from other sources, such as donors.

•

Data on long-term official capital inflows and amortization are not consistent with the
data provided by the MOF on the external financing of the budget deficit. Data on
private capital movements are incomplete.

•

Data on external debt continue to be incomplete, and external debt service obligations
and arrears are not recorded in the BOP.

•

Military imports are excluded from BOP and external debt data.

•

There is a large discrepancy between reserve flows reported in the BOP and the
reserve flows implied by the monetary survey. In particular, Net Foreign Assets
(NFA) of the banking system are much higher in the monetary survey than in the
international liquidity table derived from the balance of payments.

10.
The mission recommended the adoption of a new foreign exchange form (developed
by the mission) to improve source data—and the establishment of an enterprise register to
estimate foreign direct investment—for the balance of payments statistics. It also
recommended the dissemination of international reserves and external debt data—neither of
which is currently disseminated for reasons of confidentiality.
11.
In February 2006, an STA assessment mission visited Damascus to assess the status
of the work program as a basis for developing a METAC technical assistance program on
external sector statistics. The mission reported minimal progress in implementing the work
program and in addressing weaknesses. The mission recommended the following five
priority areas for technical assistance:
•

compiling reliable import and export data based on information from the banking
system and data sources other than the Customs Department/CBS;

•

estimating FDI data based on information from the Ministry of Planning and/or a
sample of FDI companies;

•

implementing the new reporting form for commercial banks (to improve various
components of the BOP, specifically services);

•

deriving flow data from the balance sheets from commercial banks and the CBS
(financial account transactions); and

•

hands-on training for the new staff.

50

A METAC mission will visit the Central Bank of Syria (CBS) in Damascus during June 26–
29, 2006 to: assess progress in developing the institutional infrastructure for compiling
balance of payments statistics; provide technical advice on implementing the international
transactions reporting system (ITRS) for commercial banks and foreign exchange bureaus;
review the international reserves data; and identify specific areas for further technical
assistance in revamping the data compilation system. The mission will also follow up with
CBS and the central bureau of statistics on finalizing the external sector metadata for the
General Data Dissemination System (GDDS).

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation with the
Syrian Arab Republic
On July 31, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with the Syrian Arab Republic.1
Background
The economy proved quite resilient in the face of the unsettling political developments, following
the assassination of Lebanese Prime Minister Hariri. Economic activity picked up steam buoyed
by private investment and supported by the oil boom in the Gulf region. However, growth was
accompanied by a rise in inflation, reflecting, in part, an expansionary monetary policy. The nonoil budget balance improved significantly by about 2½ percent of GDP, offsetting some of the
pronounced fall in oil revenues. However, this improvement was mainly due to transfers from
public enterprises. Similarly, the non-oil current account balance improved, contributing to
maintaining external balance despite the sharp fall in net oil exports. Public and external debts
remain moderate, and official foreign reserves cover close to 2 years of imports.
The recovery seems poised to continue in 2006 despite the still volatile regional environment.
The non-oil GDP growth momentum is expected to be sustained by robust investment
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of
the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

expansion and good export performance, reflecting greater access to regional Arab markets
and the benefits from the concerted policy to promote tourism. This, together with the windfall
from higher oil prices and an increase in Foreign Direct Investment, will maintain a comfortable
balance of payments. The 2006 budget and measures adopted subsequently, including the
increase in the price of cement and gasoline, is expected to yield close to ½ percentage-point
improvement in the underlying fiscal position. Together with a modest increase in oil revenues,
this fiscal tightening should narrow the overall budget deficit to 3¼ percent of GDP and limit the
inflationary and crowding out impact of its domestic financing. With the recent measures to
tighten credit policy, these developments should help in reining in inflation, if supported by an
appropriately restrained wage policy.
Over the medium term Syria faces daunting economic challenges. The decline of oil reserves
poses a threat to fiscal and external sustainability, and the associated fall in oil revenues will
make it harder to preserve, much less expand living standards. A bulge in labor market entrants
will strain an already precarious unemployment situation and increase pressure to protect
redundant labor in an overstaffed public sector. These challenges are further compounded by
political uncertainties and a volatile regional environment. In this context, the surge in
international oil prices has provided a short-term windfall but will aggravate the medium-term
outlook when Syria becomes a net oil importer around the year 2010 based on current oil price
projections. Based on the latest projections for oil output, staff estimates that budgetary oil
revenues and net oil exports will deteriorate by more than 10 percentage points of GDP in the
next 10 years.
To address these challenges, a number of reforms have already been initiated to encourage
private entrepreneurship, promote market mechanisms, open the economy to the rest of the
world, liberalize the financial system, and begin to strengthen the medium-term fiscal outlook.
Looking forward, the recently adopted Five-Year Plan (FYP) outlines a comprehensive strategy
to deepen these reforms.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Syrian authorities for their steady progress in implementing
reforms aimed at encouraging private entrepreneurship, promoting market mechanisms,
opening the economy, and liberalizing the financial system. The ongoing pickup in economic
activity is testimony to the impact of these reforms on the investment climate. These reforms,
together with the support from the oil boom in the Gulf region, have so far allowed the economy
to withstand the heightened political uncertainties and maintain forward momentum.
Directors noted that, although the short-term outlook and positive supply response are
encouraging, there are important challenges ahead. The short term windfall afforded by the
surge in international oil prices will end as Syria becomes a net oil importer in the next few

3
years, with adverse implications for medium-term prospects. Directors considered that the
newly-adopted FYP reflects appropriately the need to confront these challenges. They
encouraged the authorities to be ambitious in implementing the FYP’s comprehensive reform
strategy, in particular by pursuing strong fiscal consolidation and structural reforms to create
new sources of growth and income to replace the waning oil wealth. Directors emphasized that
putting in place efficient social safety nets will help preserve social equity and engender public
support for the reform efforts.
Directors agreed that a sizable fiscal adjustment will be needed to preserve sustainability, and
in this context observed that the adoption of a transparent fiscal policy framework, aimed at a
steady improvement in the non-oil budget balance, would be key to help maintain fiscal
discipline. They noted that a front-loaded effort, taking advantage of the current favorable
economic conjuncture, would boost market confidence.
Directors agreed that introducing a broad-based value-added tax (VAT) and phasing out
petroleum price subsidies should be the main pillars of the fiscal adjustment. In addition,
phasing out petroleum price subsidies should generate significant efficiency gains, redress part
of the social inequity in the existing policy, and bolster long term growth prospects by enabling
fiscal retrenchment without cutting critical spending on education, health, and infrastructure.
While recognizing the challenges involved and the capacity constraints faced by the authorities,
Directors underscored that steadfast preparation of both these reforms, with technical
assistance support, should be given a high priority. In this respect, they called for faster
progress in implementing the reforms of tax administration needed to underpin a VAT. In
particular, preparations for introducing the tax self-assessment mechanism and opening the first
large taxpayers’ unit need to be accelerated. Directors also noted the work to be undertaken to
ensure that the compensation scheme to mitigate the impact of phasing out the petroleum price
subsidies is carefully designed and implemented.
Directors concurred that a tighter monetary stance, along with wage discipline, is needed to
reduce inflation pressures. Going forward, they called for the development of market-based
monetary instruments. They welcomed the recent steps toward exchange rate unification and
current account convertibility, including the relaxation of exchange restrictions on private sector
imports, and encouraged the authorities to move towards unification, building on the broadbased political consensus. Directors called for steady progress in the central bank’s
preparations to launch the interbank foreign exchange market and to develop the technical
capacity to intervene to reduce excessive volatility. They considered that although the level of
the real exchange rate appears broadly appropriate, its recent strengthening should be
monitored carefully in view of the prospective decline in oil exports and the need to promote
non-oil exports.

4
Directors welcomed the fast-paced expansion of private banking activity and strong investor
interest in the financial sector. They encouraged the authorities to build on the preliminary
assessment of the activities and financial position of the state banks with further steps toward
their restructuring. In this regard, independent audits of state banks could help to guide the
decision on the restructuring options, including opening their capital to strategic investors, or
liquidating significantly undercapitalized or low-franchise-value banks. Directors highlighted the
importance of ensuring that bank supervision keeps pace with financial liberalization, and that
Anti-Money Laundering/Combating Financing of Terrorism legislation is effectively implemented.
Directors welcomed the steady progress made in trade liberalization, and the authorities’
commitment to greater transparency regarding remaining trade restrictions. They urged the
authorities to give priority to eliminating key nontariff barriers in order to signal their
determination to address the trade agenda. Implementing the regulatory measures under the
Syria/European Union Association Agreement will contribute to making progress towards
observance of WTO rules and disciplines. More broadly, Directors encouraged the authorities to
press ahead with reforms aimed at scaling down the state’s involvement in the economy,
improving governance, and fostering private-sector growth.
Directors urged the authorities to improve the quality and timeliness of economic statistics,
including indicators of short-term activity. They welcomed the authorities’ decision to participate
in the General Data Dissemination System, which should give impetus to a far-reaching
revamping of Syria’s statistical infrastructure.
