URUGUAY
Staff Report for the 2006 Article IV Consultation, Fourth Review Under the Stand-By
Arrangement and Request for Waiver of Nonobservance and Modification of
Performance Criteria
Prepared by Western Hemisphere Department
(In Consultation with Other Departments)
Approved by Ranjit Teja and Adrienne Cheasty
June 14, 2006
Last Article IV consultation. On July 11, 2003, Directors recommended (i) continued fiscal consolidation; (ii)
maintaining a floating exchange rate regime; (iii) addressing balance sheet vulnerabilities; and (iv) creating
room for private sector-led growth. An Ex Post Assessment was completed on March 18, 2005.
Developments. Economic recovery since the 2002 crisis has been strong. Export-led growth, prudent monetary
policy in the context of a flexible exchange rate regime, and fiscal consolidation have contributed to a
strengthened external position, low inflation and a sharp fall in public debt. While near-term risks have
declined, significant vulnerabilities remain, related to high public debt and balance sheet dollarization.
Article IV issues. Discussions focused on policies to reduce macroeconomic vulnerabilities further, including
by (i) sustaining low inflation and further building reserves within a flexible exchange rate regime; (ii) reducing
financial sector vulnerabilities linked to high dollarization and large state banks; (iii) sustaining fiscal
consolidation and reducing budget rigidities to lower public debt and improving the public debt structure; and
(iv) trade diversification, labor market reforms, and improving the investment climate to reduce the risks to the
growth outlook.
Fourth review issues. Preliminary data indicate that all performance criteria for this review have been met,
except for approval of the police pension reform, for which a waiver and resetting to October is requested. Final
data will be reported prior to the Board meeting. Approval dates for tax and financial sector reforms, which are
performance criteria, are proposed to be modified within 2006 to reflect the congressional timetable. Also, it is
proposed to revise the June monetary performance criteria to reflect the stronger NIR and to establish the endSeptember and end-December performance criteria.
Staff discussions. Discussions were held in Montevideo during May 3–17. The mission met with Finance
Minister Astori, Central Bank President Cancela, Industry Minister Lepra, Labor Minister Bonomi, other senior
officials, and private sector and labor representatives. The staff team comprised M. Piñón (Head), J. CanalesKriljenko, S. Eble (all WHD), H. Finger (PDR), A. Hajdenberg (FAD), H. Kamil (ICM), G. Gelos (Resident
Representative), S. Ramirez and S. Seelig (MFD). C. Pazarbasioglu (FSAP Head, ICM) and D. Vogel (OED)
participated in some of the policy discussions.
Exchange system. Uruguay has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 and maintains an
exchange system that is free of multiple currency practices and exchange restrictions on current international
transactions. Uruguay has followed an independently floating exchange rate regime since July 29, 2002, but the
authorities have frequently intervened to build reserves and reduce exchange rate volatility.
Stand-By Arrangement. In March, Uruguay repurchased in advance all Fund obligations falling due in 2006
(SDR 434.3 million) as a cash management operation. Outstanding obligations as of end-April 2006 were
SDR 1,261 million (411 percent of quota), and SDR 588.5 million remain to be disbursed under the program.
Data. Uruguay subscribed to the SDDS in February 2004 and its statistical database is generally adequate for
surveillance (Appendix V).

I. BACKGROUND: ASSESSING PROGRESS AND IDENTIFYING VULNERABILITIES
1.
Focus. With the recovery from the 2002 crisis well advanced, discussions focused on
policies to reduce remaining vulnerabilities and sustain growth. Even though near-term risks
are relatively low in the current environment, strong policy implementation is needed to
consolidate macrostability and confidence in the system, reduce further still important
balance sheet vulnerabilities, including from high public debt and dollarization, and sustain
growth over the medium term. The generally favorable domestic and external conditions, and
continued political support for the program, provide an important opportunity.
A. Macroeconomic and Financial Trends
2.
Macroeconomic indicators. Many of those have improved to better than pre-crisis
levels.
•

Economic recovery. GDP has rebounded in the last two years (18 percent), reaching
its 1998 pre-crisis peak, mainly led by exports and investment. Unemployment, while
still high at 12 percent and mainly structural, has declined considerably with the
reduced output gap, with labor participation rates now close to pre-recession levels.
Real wages have started to recover, but are still some 13 percent below the 2001
levels.

•

Exchange rate. The peso has appreciated significantly since the sharp depreciation
that followed its float in mid-2002. Still, it remains some 20 percent more depreciated
in real effective terms compared with pre-crisis levels. In 2005, even as the central
bank took advantage of strong capital inflows to rebuild foreign exchange reserves,
the peso strengthened by 8½ percent vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar. BCU resistance to
further peso appreciation led to a stable exchange rate in early 2006, but some
flexibility has been restored since.

•

Low inflation. Inflation was quickly
brought under control after spiking in
2002, aided by the peso appreciation, and
since 2004 has been in single digits.

•

Improved financial indicators. Soundness
indicators have improved markedly,
including capital adequacy and loan
performance. Credit has started to pick up
slowly, but still amounts to only
50 percent of deposits (70 percent in
2001). Also, the share of sight deposits in
total deposits is now well above that five
years ago.

•

Strengthened external position. With buoyant export growth, the external current
account ended with only a modest deficit in 2005, despite a steep rise in imports
stemming partly from high oil prices and a pick-up in FDI. International reserves
have reached US$3.4 billion, compared to US$3.1 billion before the crisis and a low
of US$0.8 billion in 2002; and NIR has increased by over US$1.5 billion since.

•

Declining public debt. Strong growth, the improved fiscal position, lower interest
costs, and currency appreciation have lowered the public debt-to-GDP ratio from
105 percent at end-2003 to 69 percent at end-2005.

3.
Underlying factors. These results have been driven by solid macro and structural
policies, supported by favorable external conditions. Major policy achievements include:

Substantial fiscal adjustment. The
primary balance has shifted from
large deficits during 1998–2001, to
surpluses rapidly approaching the
4 percent of GDP medium-term
target. The adjustment fell mainly on
expenditures, where wages, social
security benefits and capital spending
have significantly contracted in real
terms (Figure 1). A five-year budget
consistent with the medium-term
primary surplus target of 4 percent of
GDP was approved in 2005.

•

Strengthened public debt management. Following the end-May 2003 debt exchange,
the debt structure has been gradually improved by lengthening maturities, and
increasing the share of fixed rate and peso debt (mostly indexed to the CPI). Still,
some 85 percent of public debt continues to be denominated in foreign currency. A
debt management unit at the Ministry of Finance was recently established to prepare
and implement a strategy to further reduce vulnerabilities.

Monetary policy geared at maintaining low inflation in the context of a flexible
exchange rate. The adoption of a flexible exchange rate regime in mid-2002, after
several years of a crawling band, has been a key accomplishment in allowing the
economy to better adjust to shocks and in providing incentives for de-dollarization.
Also, the new framework of preannounced one-year-ahead inflation target ranges,
pursued by managing base money, has lowered inflation and inflationary
expectations. Facing large private capital inflows, the authorities have intervened in
the foreign exchange market to increase international reserves and slow down peso
appreciation (Figure 2).

•

Financial sector reforms. Prudential norms were tightened to internalize risks from
high financial dollarization and exposure to regional contagion, and to reduce credit
risk. While the state bank BROU has improved some procedures, further progress
with risk management and controls is still needed. The state mortgage bank BHU was

-7transformed into a nondeposit taking institution and is being further restructured to
restore its financial viability. NBC, the bank formed with performing assets of three
of the failed banks was recently privatized. A bill being considered by Congress sets
price stability as a main goal of the BCU and delinks the appointment of its board
members from the political cycle; unifies financial supervision; and creates an agency
outside the BCU to manage the deposit insurance fund and bank resolutions.
•

Sustainable income policies. To channel wage pressures, the new government
reinstated wage councils, where agreements are reached at the industry level, with the
government intervening in case of an impasse. The resulting real wage increases in
2005 of 4–5 percent have been broadly in line with productivity growth. Public sector
wage rules were modified in the last five-year budget, linking increases to inflation
and economy-wide productivity growth, and made conditional on attainment of the
primary fiscal target.

•

Other reforms to lay the foundations for sustained growth are in train. A farreaching tax reform bill currently being debated in Congress, while revenue neutral, is
expected to improve significantly the tax structure and introduce a personal income
tax. A new competition bill is also being considered by Congress and a bankruptcy
framework bill establishing Chapter-11 type procedures is to be submitted shortly.

B. Underlying Vulnerabilities and Sensitivity Analysis
4.
Improvements. The economy’s capacity to weather shocks has increased since the
crisis. In particular, risks have declined as a result of: (i) larger central bank reserves and
commercial banks’ liquidity; (ii) lower exposure to nonresident deposits; (iii) higher export
market diversification; (iv) a strengthened banking system and supervision; (v) policies to
improve the economy’s capacity to adjust to shocks, notably a flexible exchange rate; and
(vi) sound macro policies and structural reforms to set the debt on a downward trend and
foster sustained growth.

¾ System liquidity. Central bank reserves and commercial banks’ liquidity cover now
about 70 percent of banks’ deposits and external short-term debt, compared with
43 percent in 2001. More than twice the level of nonresident deposits is now
covered by commercial bank liquidity, compared with about 80 percent in 2001.
However, with the shift toward short-term deposits, coverage of short-term debt and
sight deposits by commercial bank liquidity is well below pre-crisis levels.
Moreover, high liquidity is also partially explained by the so far slower recovery in
credit than in deposits.

1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005
sight deposits is now even higher than
before the crisis, likely explained by low interest rates on time deposits (linked to
weak credit demand) and past experiences with reprogramming of time deposits in
times of financial difficulties.

•

Dependence. Uruguay’s real and financial linkages to Argentina have been
remarkably tight. For example, Argentine consumption and Uruguayan GDP are
strongly cointegrated, and about 80 percent of fluctuations in Uruguay in a two-year
horizon can be explained by changes in consumption in Argentina. Nevertheless,
Uruguay is making strides in reducing vulnerabilities from changes in the region,
with nonresident deposits representing now a much lower share in the financial
system and a substantial increase in trade outside the Mercosur region. (See Selected
Issues Paper—Uruguay’s Growth Story)

•

Effects on liquidity buffers.
¾ Greater resilience. Several tests show increased resilience: (i) a 20 percent drop
in deposits or 50 percent in sight deposits would reduce banking system liquidity
coverage of deposits and short-term debt to 56–65 percent (similar shocks would
have reduced it from 43 percent to about 32 percent in 2001); (ii) a one-year loss
of access to public external financing (2007) would reduce the system’s coverage
by only 2 percentage points to 68 percent and by 5 percent in central bank’s
coverage to 28 percent; and (iii) a full withdrawal of nonresident deposits would

- 13 lead to a decline in the system’s coverage to 64 percent, which would still be
above pre-crisis levels.
¾ Areas of vulnerability. For instance, a large recovery in bank lending, leading to
a return to the pre-crisis credit/deposit ratio, would reduce the liquidity coverage
back to pre-crisis levels (50 percent). Also, sustained economic growth will be
important to ensure the continued recovery of the financial sector, including by
maintaining healthy loan portfolio and bank profitability.
¾ Fund resources. These still provide important support. While coverage of
deposits and short-term debt by banks’ liquidity and central bank reserves have
increased significantly, excluding IMF resources, the coverage would be only
52 percent.
•

Debt sustainability. The debt-to-GDP ratios are particularly sensitive to the real
exchange rate or a relaxation in fiscal policy—a 10 percent real depreciation or a
sustained 1 percent lower primary balance would increase the debt by 6–7 percent of
GDP by 2012.

•

Capital adequacy. The FSAP found that the capital-asset-ratios in the system would
not be materially affected by a moderate depreciation or an interest rate increase.
However, these shocks are likely to have a larger impact through credit risk, as about
a third of all loans are extended to debtors with unstable foreign-currency incomes.

•

Combined effects. While the economy may be better prepared to deal with single and
moderate shocks, in reality the effects of shocks are likely to be felt through more
than one channel. Stress tests of the FSAP indicate that severe current or capital
account shocks would reduce the capital of many financial institutions below
minimum requirements and in the most extreme case lead to the insolvency of a few
but not systemically important financial institutions.
C.

Medium-Term Outlook and Alternative Scenarios

7.
Macroeconomic outlook. Uruguay is expected to grow on average by 3–4 percent
over the next years—above its historical rate of 2 percent—with inflation stabilizing below
4 percent. This is based on sustained policy implementation in the context of benign external
conditions, with the world economy expanding, and Argentina and Brazil growing at or
above potential rates, in an environment of international interest rates staying broadly at
current levels, while the terms of trade would deteriorate slightly. Under these conditions, the
primary surplus is envisaged to reach its 4 percent of GDP medium-term target in 2007,
which will help reduce the public debt-to-GDP ratio to below 50 percent by end-2012. The
current account deficit is projected to remain modest and only widen temporarily due to FDIfinanced investment for two major pulp mill projects.

8.
Scenarios. Changes in the external and domestic policy environment pose, however,
considerable up and downside risks (Appendix I). Illustrative scenarios show that public debt
by 2012 could be some 10–15 percent of GDP above baseline, assuming: (i) higher
international interest rates in an environment of lower international liquidity; (ii) a sustained
global slowdown of 1 percentage point and lower non-oil commodity prices; or (iii) a
weakening in domestic fiscal policy by 1 percent of GDP. A positive shock related to
stronger growth, however, would further reduce the debt ratio to 40 percent of GDP by 2012.
While these scenarios would not affect materially the financial system, the FSAP presents
more extreme scenarios with severe impact on financial institutions.
II.

POLICY DISCUSSION: THE CHALLENGE OF REDUCING VULNERABILITIES

9.
Focus on vulnerabilities. The authorities agreed to continue increasing buffers and
strengthening Uruguay’s underlying performance, noting that under current strong policies
and expected continued favorable external conditions, vulnerabilities should decline
considerably with time. They also highlighted that the political and institutional stability of
Uruguay and its track record of sound policy implementation were important stabilizing
factors.
A. Exchange Rate and Monetary Policies under Volatile Capital Flows
10.
Large capital inflows. The authorities reiterated their commitment to a flexible
exchange rate, while noting difficult policy trade-offs in light of large (about twice the size of
base money in 2005) and uncertain capital inflows. In particular, they expressed concern
about a possible loss of export competitiveness as a result of excessive appreciation. Against
this backdrop, they had decided to step up foreign exchange purchases since late 2005. Staff

- 15 -

noted that while rebuilding reserves and resistance to appreciation pressures linked to shortterm capital inflows may be appropriate, exchange rate flexibility should be maintained.
Targeting the exchange rate should be avoided in an economy that is highly exposed to
external shocks.

Competitiveness. The strong appreciation of the peso in the past year—while
strengthening the debt sustainability outlook and supporting low inflation— has prompted
some public concern over competitiveness. However, continued buoyancy of exports,
econometric estimates of the equilibrium rate, and labor cost developments in the
manufacturing sector indicate that Uruguay’s exchange rate is not overvalued (Box 1). Staff
and authorities agreed that targeting an exchange rate below its equilibrium level would
eventually lead to higher inflation and that lasting improvements in competitiveness
depended on moving ahead with productivity-enhancing structural reforms.

- 16 -

Box 1. Assessment of External Competitiveness1
Notwithstanding the significant appreciation of the REER since early 2004, several indicators suggest
that Uruguay has remained competitive.

• Exports. Since the 2002 crisis, the current account has remained nearly balanced, with exports performing
vigorously (17 percent volume growth in 2005). Moreover, inflows of foreign direct investment have
increased markedly, pointing to Uruguay’s attractiveness as a location for investment.

• Real exchange rate. The PPI, CPI and ULC-based REERs
have remained substantially more depreciated than before the
crisis, with some 11, 19 and 43 percent below their
respective 2001 averages. The CPI-based REER appears to
be near its long-run equilibrium, with the current rate within
the 95 percent confidence interval of the estimated
equilibrium level (estimate based on a long-term relationship
between the REER, real GDP relative to trading partners,
and net foreign assets). The analysis also suggests that the
exchange rate was significantly more appreciated than its
long-term equilibrium level before the 2002 devaluation.

• Other competitiveness indicators. The ratio of export unit values to unit labor costs, a proxy for profit
margins in the tradable sector, has improved substantially, remaining more than 80 percent above its precrisis level. The ratio of prices for tradable to non-tradable goods, an indicator of competitiveness between the
tradable and non-tradable sectors, has declined since the crisis, but remains 5 percent above pre-crisis levels.
——————————
1/ See Selected Issues Paper—Assessing Competitiveness in Uruguay.

12.
Inflation targeting. There was agreement that monetary and exchange rate policies
should remain focused on achieving the inflation objective, while moving to full-fledged
inflation targeting over time. Achieving the inflation targets would further improve central
bank credibility and over time help reduce financial dollarization. At this point, the
authorities however did not feel ready to move to full-fledged inflation targeting, given
remaining weaknesses in the financial system, high gross financing needs, and the still
incomplete understanding of price formation. Nevertheless, they stressed that the proposed
new central bank law and the planned central bank recapitalization would be important steps
in this direction. Regarding monetary policy instruments, with high dollarization and
remonetization, they have decreased emphasis on monetary aggregates and were monitoring
an array of indicators, but were skeptical about the use of short-term peso interest rates in the
immediate future, given the high degree of dollarization and the shallowness of the peso
money market, and agreed that further development of local markets would be desirable.
13.
Policy transparency. While the current framework has helped in lowering inflation,
to consolidate central bank credibility it would be important that its actions be better
understood by the market, including the mechanisms and rationale of foreign exchange

- 17 interventions and their link to the inflation objective. The authorities agreed that improving
the monetary framework and its transparency was key, and that they would welcome Fund
TA in this area later this year.
14.
Rebuilding foreign exchange. The high degree of dollarization, the government’s
full deposit guarantee of state banks’ deposits, and remaining weaknesses in the banking
system make it important to continue building reserves. The central bank has recently
increased significantly its reserve target for 2006, and intends to build reserves further over
the medium term, as opportunities from capital inflows arise and remain consistent with the
inflation objective. While rules-based preannounced purchases of the central bank would
have clear advantages of transparency, the authorities observed that such a policy had put the
central bank in a weak position in 2005 in a shallow market and reduced the effectiveness of
intervention.
B. Financial Sector Vulnerabilities
15.
Dollarization. The authorities agreed that high dollarization remained an important
challenge for the financial system, with most potential borrowers lacking a stable dollar
income stream. They explained that the immediate vulnerability from high dollarization had
decreased as low credit demand had resulted in high foreign exchange liquidity of banks. In
addition, prudential rules that discourage dollarization and internalize the risks of dollar
lending have been issued, and the deposit insurance scheme and new tax reform provide
incentives to reduce financial dollarization through differential premiums and tax rates
(Box 2). Encouraging the market to develop hedging instruments to transfer currency risk
will also be important.

Imposed capital requirements for FX open position (modified in 2003).

- 18 -

16.
State banks. A more competitive and modern financial system will be key to ensure
more effective financial intermediation, and the current large state-presence in the insurance,
pension and banking sector distorts competition and poses macroeconomic risks. The
authorities argued that given Uruguayan society’s preferences expressed in several referenda,
they were not considering privatizing BROU. They however agreed to consider
improvements in its governance, including making directors subject to fit-and-proper tests,
but noted that significant improvements were already being made through better regulation
and transparency.
17.
New lending. Strong prudential policies and creditor discipline will be instrumental
in ensuring sound financial intermediation, especially when lending starts picking up.
Moreover, BHU loans and the small loans of BROU should be incorporated into the credit
registry to improve credit culture, foreclosure and bankruptcy processes should be shortened

Box 3: Main Findings and Recommendations from the FSAP
Main findings
• Financial soundness indicators—have improved significantly and commercial banks are better prepared than
in 2002 to withstand medium-sized shocks given their high liquidity and capital adequacy. The large liquidity
at public bank BROU, accounting for half of system’s deposits, reduces the fiscal exposure arising from the
full deposit guarantee established in its charter.
• Regulation and supervision of the financial system— has improved significantly since the crisis (see Box 2
above). The bank resolution framework is also being strengthened.
• Stress tests—show that while the system appears prepared to handle moderate shocks, severe current or capital
account shocks would lead to a significant deterioration of the capitalization of several financial institutions in
Uruguay.
• State banks—insufficient resources and the predominance of public financial institutions presents
informational, oversight, and governance challenges. The constitutional status of two public banks (at par with
the central bank) remains an issue. While the supervisor can impose sanctions on these banks and their senior
management, it has no influence on the appointment or removal of directors and management. Several Basel
core principles have been rated materially noncompliant because the BCU cannot apply the full range of
corrective actions. Predatory underpricing practices by some public financial institutions and government
guarantees create unfair competition to private institutions.
• Pension funds (AFAPs)—the market is highly concentrated and government guarantees (including a
minimum investment return in the public AFAP) pose potential risks. Investment regulations governing the
AFAPs allow little asset risk diversification of affiliates’ investments.
• Payments and securities settlement systems— are being upgraded, but their oversight and legal frameworks
need to be strengthened.
• AML—formal cooperation and information exchange mechanisms with other overseas supervisors,
particularly in neighboring countries, are not yet in place.
Main recommendations
• Contingent liabilities. Conduct an independent analysis of the potential contingent liabilities that may arise
from state-owned institutions in banking, insurance and pension fund sectors.
• Supervision. Increase resources for effective supervision, improve information systems and provide training to
staff.
• State banks. Require directors and managers of public financial institutions to satisfy supervisory fit and
proper requirements and to be subject to supervisory corrective actions.
• Prudential policies. Address the factors contributing to the weak credit culture by making the credit registry
easier to use and speeding up incorporation of BHU loans and the small loans of BROU, strengthening the lax
credit and debt relief practices of public banks, and shortening foreclosure and bankruptcy processes.
• Pension funds. Liberalize rules for AFAP investments in nongovernment obligations, including allowing
limited, high-quality offshore investments. Eliminate the government-guaranteed minimum return in AFAP
Republica.
• Insurance system. Any mortgage default insurance system would need to be evaluated carefully and ensure
that underlying risks are priced accurately.
• Payments system. Form a small unit in charge of payments system oversight, separate from systems
operations, and improve the legal framework in the areas of bankruptcy procedures, netting arrangements, and
custody arrangements. Upgrade the RTGS payment system as planned.
• AML. Engage in cooperation and information exchange agreements with foreign supervisors.

C. Sustainable Fiscal and Public Debt Framework
18.
Fiscal policy framework. Sustaining high primary surpluses of 4 percent of GDP
will continue to be at the core of the authorities’ fiscal strategy, but at times of high growth
and strong capital inflows higher surpluses could be targeted, to lower the burden on
monetary policy and further reduce debt. The authorities considered that they would meet
their fiscal targets in 2006, as they had done in 2005, but also noted that the current targets
already imposed considerable constraints. In their view, fostering long-term growth would
also require allocating additional public resources to strengthen infrastructure and making
room for other priority expenditures, including education. Further, while the ceilings in the
recently passed net debt law would allow for a higher than currently targeted debt-to-GDP
ratio, their fiscal strategy would continue to be guided by the budget framework.
19.
Strengthening revenue. There was
agreement that tax administration reforms
were critical for attaining the ambitious
revenue targets and sustaining fiscal
performance into the medium term. The
current practice of setting high tariffs for
public utility services to generate fiscal
revenues is inefficient, and should be
replaced by a more rational tariff-setting
mechanism. However, before tackling this
issue, the plan is to consolidate the tax
reform to minimize fiscal risks.

kick in. On civil service reform, the government
is considering measures to improve the quality
of services and reduce costs, which could over the longer term include changes to the
remuneration schemes and functional restructuring, but the discussion is still in its early
stages.

- 21 -

21.
Public debt structure. There was agreement that implementing the government’s
debt strategy was critical to increase resilience to shocks, with the authorities taking
advantage of favorable market conditions to advance financing plans and improve the debt
structure, including by issuing debt in local currency and smoothing the amortization profile.
They also plan to further develop the local bond market by extending maturities, which
should help to further shift the currency composition from foreign to local currency. Staff
encouraged the authorities to move more aggressively to improve the currency and maturity
composition of debt to lock in the current generally favorable conditions.
D. Growth, Competitiveness, and Diversification
22.
Growth. Sustaining growth into the medium term will be critical to allow the
continued improvement in social conditions, while ensuring fiscal and debt sustainability,
and providing the basis for a healthy financial system. In this regard, the government has
prepared an ambitious reform agenda (see Box 2, Country Report No. 06/197), of which
many elements, such as tax and financial sector reforms, are already advancing. Further, a
new competition bill is being considered by Congress and a new bankruptcy framework bill
introducing a Chapter 11-type of regime would be submitted soon.
23.
Openness and trade diversification. The authorities reaffirmed their commitment to
seek further trade expansion to achieve scale economies, while diversifying to reduce
exposure to the region. They pointed to their active role in the WTO’s Doha round, the
bilateral trade agreement with Mexico since 2003 and increased trade relations with the EU,
and that they would welcome an enlarged Mercosur. Also, they are exploring further ways to
deepen economic ties with the US—consistent with Mercosur— beyond the recently signed
Bilateral Investment Treaty.
24.
Investment climate. Improving the business climate is key for attracting private
investment to sustain growth. The recent work of the growth commission (Compromiso
Nacional) had identified further measures, including establishing an investor relations office
and reforming public procurement, which have been incorporated in the government’s
agenda.
25.
Labor market flexibility. In recent months there has been some public concern
about the increased number of occupations of factories by striking workers and proposed
minimum wage increases. The authorities pointed out that labor regulations were not rigid in
comparison to the region, but acknowledged that strong unions and negotiated agreements
imposed constraints in some sectors, especially in the banking sector. The number of strikes
had actually declined to a decade-low in 2005 and the wage councils had helped bring
stability to labor relations, and the recently discussed increase in the minimum wage of
20 percent would keep it nonbinding except for very few sectors. The government is also
considering to allow for firm-level negotiations within the current framework.
26.
Public-Private-Partnerships (PPPs). With fiscal constraints and limited scope for
privatization, the authorities consider private participation in public infrastructure as
important to close the large investment gap, expand capacity further, and improve the

- 22 -

efficiency of public enterprises. They do not intend to set an overall legal framework for
PPPs at this point, but rather move ahead with a few projects, which would be well-selected,
carefully designed, and their contingent fiscal costs minimized. (See Selected Issues Paper—
Options to Increase Infrastructure Investment in Uruguay).
27.
Public Enterprises. Reform of public enterprises is important to reduce the high
public tariffs and improve service delivery. While privatization is not being considered, the
authorities are studying various options, including increased association with the private
sector, establishing better links between remunerations and productivity, and shifting some of
the enterprises to private law over the medium term.
III. FOURTH REVIEW DISCUSSIONS
A. Recent Developments
28.
Macroeconomic outcomes. Results and policy developments have been mostly
favorable.
•
Growth. With continuous vigorous growth in early 2006, projections for the year
have been revised upwards to 4½ from 4 percent,
•

Inflation. The annual inflation rate increased from 6 percent in April to just above
6½ percent in May, reflecting the pass-through of higher oil prices. It is expected to
return to within the target range by year-end (4½–6½ percent), although emerging
price pressures (including a recent electricity tariff increase) pose an upside risk to
this outlook.

•

Fiscal performance. Preliminary data show a higher than programmed primary
surplus in the first quarter (4.8 percent of GDP against 2.4 percent in the program,
annualized), reflecting higher tax collection and social security contributions, which
more than offset weaker performance by public enterprises; the outcome also reflects
better local government performance and temporary delays in the social emergency
program.

•

Monetary policy. The central bank exceeded the March indicative base money target
by 7½ percent, and raised its 2006 M1 growth target from 12 percent in December
2005 to 28 percent, while leaving its one-year-ahead inflation target range unchanged
from December (4½–6½ percent).

•

Exchange rate policy. Following periods of large central bank foreign exchange
purchases, the exchange rate was constant during some periods in early 2006.
Exchange rate flexibility has since resumed.

- 23 -

•

•

Country risk. With the recent
tightening of international liquidity
conditions, Uruguay’s sovereign
spreads and domestic interest rates
increased in line with neighboring
countries, but the exchange rate was
largely unaffected.

29.

Structural reforms. There has been important progress in the structural area.

•

Tax reform law. This is the key reform priority in the near term. The lower house is
discussing the bill and congressional approval (end-October performance criterion) is
now expected by mid-September (modification proposed to advance approval date).

•

Revenue administration. The social security agency (BPS) is on track to prepare a
plan to strengthen its auditing and collection functions (end-June benchmark). The
authorities have also identified the main elements of the customs reform, and the
preparation of a detailed plan, including institutional and legal changes, is on track
(end-August benchmark).

•

Budget. A government group is working on the institutional budget process and will
be assisted by Fund TA in developing a reform plan (end-August benchmark).

•

Specialized pension schemes. Working groups have been established to prepare draft
legislation for the military and banking employee pension reforms to be submitted to
congress by end-November (performance criterion).

•

Growth. The government published its pro-growth reform agenda in March, and a
timetable for the implementation of the measures was published with a slight delay in
early June (end-March benchmark).

•

Bank restructuring. NBC was privatized in early June (end-June benchmark). BHU
restructuring is progressing well (end-August performance criterion).

•

Bankruptcy law. The draft law was presented for public consultation and will be
submitted to congress in time (end-June benchmark).

30.
Delays. With the government giving priority to passage of the all important tax
reform law, the congressional agenda is being rescheduled to defer consideration of pension
and central bank reforms.

- 24 -

•

Police pension reform law. Approval (end-May performance criterion) is now
expected by end-October (waiver requested). However, the delay will have no impact
on the attainment of the 2006 fiscal targets.

•

Financial sector law. Approval of the law is being delayed (end-June performance
criterion) to give priority to the tax reform, and is now expected by end-November
(modification proposed).
B. Discussions

31.
Monetary policy stance. The authorities view the recent pickup in inflation as
transitory, owing to a drought-related increase in food prices and the recent pass-through of
higher international oil prices, and were confident to attain the end-year target range. Also,
the targeted additional base money increase of 16 percent (equivalent to US$180 million)
would be fully met through foreign exchange purchases, consistent with the observed
remonetization. However, given the increase in inflation and market expectations for 2006
above the target range, uncertainties about continued strength in money demand, a reduced
output gap, and some money market rates negative in real terms, staff argued that the risks to
the inflation outlook have increased. Against this background, it urged the authorities to
initially target a slower base money growth until inflation has settled well within the year’s
end target range. The authorities explained that, while inflation is still within their quarterly
target range (5–7 percent), they are monitoring developments closely and considering to
tighten the stance even ahead of the next review.
32.
Reserve target. The central bank has increased its reserve target for 2006 by
US$410 million—and above original program projections for 2008—owing to larger than
programmed foreign exchange purchases and the decision by the government to forgo
foreign exchange available from forward operations maturing in 2006. The revised NIR
accumulation target for 2005–06 of US$1.6 billion, compares with an original projection of
US$1.1 billion during the three-year program.
33.
FSAP. The authorities recognized that FSAP recommendations would further
strengthen the financial sector and indicated that they would, after a thorough analysis,
discuss incorporation of key recommendations into the program’s conditionality at the next
review. They also explained that the approval of the financial sector law, which is now
expected by end-November, would address several of the issues raised by the FSAP. Staff
stressed that strengthening the authority of the supervisor over public banks, within the
constitutional constraints, was important to meet international supervisory standards.
34.
Fiscal targets. Exceeding the 2006 fiscal targets would be desirable to further lower
the high public debt, help control inflation, and moderate appreciation pressures.. On public
enterprises performance, the authorities are committed to continue fully passing through
international oil prices to protect revenue targets; drought-related shortfalls in the electricity
company would be offset by better performance in the telecommunications company and the
central government. Staff urged to monitor the situation closely and to execute spending
cautiously to prevent slippages.

- 25 -

35.
Revenue administration. It is important to advance with the revenue administration
preparations for the tax reform. Initial steps in the authorities’ action plan include delineating
responsibilities between the DGI and the BPS to administer the personal income tax,
appointing a high level working group to coordinate the actions of the collection agencies,
drafting the regulations for the reform, and restructuring administration processes.
36.
Growth measures. The SBA has already scheduled many important reforms of the
recently published growth agenda, including bankruptcy legislation, tax reform, and bank
restructuring. In addition, it is proposed to include establishing a private sector relations
office by August 2006 and strengthening government procurement procedures by July 2007
as benchmarks in the program.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL—THE NEED TO STAY THE COURSE
37.
Strong policies. Uruguay’s strong policies, supported by favorable external
conditions, have contributed to the sharp recovery since the 2002 crisis. Four years of large
primary fiscal surpluses, financial sector restructuring, and prudent debt management have
contributed to a significant fall in debt ratios and improved debt structure, and a strengthened
liquidity position of the financial system. Careful monetary policy within a flexible exchange
rate regime brought inflation quickly down and has helped stabilize inflationary expectations
in the low single digits. This has been accompanied by important structural reforms,
including in the fiscal, financial sector, and business climate areas and has resulted in a
strengthened market confidence in Uruguay’s prospects.
38.
Remaining vulnerabilities. The economy has generally become more resilient to
shocks—macro policies are stronger; the flexible exchange rate allows the economy to better
adjust to shocks; stricter prudential norms are in place; public banks have been or are being
restructured; and key buffers, such as liquidity and reserve coverage, are higher. However,
while rapidly declining, public debt remains high and largely dollarized, central bank
reserves remain relatively low, and the financial system is still vulnerable. Thus, sustained
strong policy implementation and advancing with structural reforms will be key. Current
favorable global conditions provide a good opportunity to advance with this objective.
39.
Low inflation. This is critical to further improve the credibility of the central bank
and help reduce financial dollarization. Staff commends the central bank for keeping
inflation in check and, while inflation risks have increased, supports the proposed
modification of indicative targets for base money, given the authorities’ commitment to
adjust policies as necessary to meet the inflation objectives. Moving toward full-fledged
inflation targeting could help institutionalize the commitment to low inflation, and the new
central bank law increasing its autonomy will be a significant step in this direction. It will be
important to enhance transparency of monetary policy, strengthen inflation forecasting of the
central bank and develop new instruments to better communicate the stance of monetary
policy. In this context, staff commends the authorities for their ongoing efforts to develop
deeper markets in local currency. The newly established debt management unit should play a
key role in these endeavors.

- 26 -

40.
Exchange rate flexibility. The real exchange rate appears to remain at competitive
levels, as evidenced by strong exports, a near current account balance, and a real effective
exchange rate well below pre-crisis levels. Nevertheless, given the risk that large capital
inflows may not be sustained, some resistance to appreciation may be appropriate, but
interventions should avoid signaling the existence of an exchange rate target. The restoration
of exchange rate flexibility after brief periods of rigidity in early 2006 is encouraging, and
the authorities should also explore methods to make interventions more transparent and better
understood by market participants.
41.
International reserves. Reserves should be increased considerably over the medium
term. While now well above pre-crisis levels, reserve coverage of short-term debt and dollar
deposits is still low compared to other dollarized economies. Continuing capital inflows
provide an opportunity to strengthen reserves in the near future, and the large increases now
expected for 2006, beyond the initial program indicative targets, will be an important nearterm step in this direction. However, large capital inflows also constitute a challenge for
monetary policy to ensure that both the inflation objectives are met and exchange flexibility
is maintained.
42.
State banks. Continued reforms are essential to reduce risks associated with the
public sector’s large share in the banking sector, including because of full deposit guarantees.
The ongoing restructuring of BHU should be completed as scheduled, and selection of
managers in state banks should be subject to fit and proper criteria as set by the
superintendency. Further, strong prudential policies and creditor discipline need to be in
place once lending starts picking up. The recommendations of the FSAP provide useful
guidance in these areas, and should be implemented.
43.
Fiscal sustainability. Achieving high primary surpluses is necessary to bring about
debt sustainability and further enhance the credibility of the overall policy framework.
Stronger economic growth could provide an opportunity to overperform on fiscal targets,
further reduce debt and help in reducing the burden on monetary policy in dealing with
capital inflows. The revenue-neutral and efficiency-enhancing design of the tax reform needs
to be protected. Swift progress in tax administration will be instrumental for successful
implementation of the reform and attaining the ambitious revenue targets. Continuing to fully
pass through in international oil prices will also be important. Public enterprise reform would
also help reduce reliance on high tariffs. While large reductions in pension outlays are
unlikely given Uruguayan demographics, the authorities could study options to improve the
efficiency and reduce costs of the system. Also, a comprehensive civil service reform could
result in important improvements in public services.
44.
Growth. The risks to growth from current account shocks and possible loss of
competitiveness also need to be addressed. Further trade liberalization and diversification of
export markets should help reduce vulnerabilities from regional dependencies. Improving the
investment climate, strengthening the bankruptcy framework and maintaining good labor
relations and a competitive labor market will also be key. Finally, plans for PPPs provide a
good opportunity for upgrading infrastructure but should be initially kept at a limited scale

- 27 -

and be handled cautiously, including by adequately sharing risks with the private sectors and
properly recording of the transactions in the fiscal accounts.
45.
Next Article IV consultation. It is proposed that it will be held on a 24-month cycle,
in accordance with the provisions of the July 15, 2002 decision on consultation cycles for
countries with Fund arrangements.
46.
Completion of the review. In light of the strong performance under the program, and
the positive outlook, staff recommends completion of the fourth review. Available
information suggests that all performance criteria have been observed, except for the
implementation of the police pension fund reform, because of changes in the congressional
timetable, involving early consideration of the tax reform and the postponement of the police
pension and the financial sector reforms. The authorities have expressed their continued
commitment to implement these reforms, and in light of these corrective actions, staff
supports the authorities' request for a waiver for the nonobservance of the end-May structural
performance criterion and its resetting for end-October, and to change the tax and financial
sector reforms test dates to mid-September and end-November, respectively.

APPENDIX I

URUGUAY: PUBLIC SECTOR DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS AND BALANCE SHEET RISKS
1.
Uruguay’s public debt outlook has strengthened significantly from that one right
after the 2002 crisis. At that time, the debt-to-GDP ratio was over 105 percent of GDP,
projected to decline gradually to 75 percent by 2012. After the 2003 debt exchange, the outlook
strengthened further, with the projected debt-to-GDP ratio down to 63 percent by 2012. Since
then, the debt-to-GDP ratio has declined by some 30 percentage points, to an estimated
69 percent by end-2005, and it is now envisaged to decline to 48 percent by 2012. The
improved outlook reflects mainly stronger than previously envisaged growth, recovery of the
real exchange rate, and lower interest rates.
2.
Although the structure of Uruguay’s public debt has improved, it remains highly
vulnerable to interest rate, exchange rate, and rollover risks. Of the total debt, almost
90 percent is exposed to exchange rate risk (mainly the U.S. dollar and SDR rates) and about
40 percent to interest rate risk. Contractual short-term debt has fallen significantly to about
2 percent of total debt, but residual short-term debt remains large (16 percent of total debt).
While projected debt-service has declined further since the approval of the current program in
June 2005, reflecting lower interest costs and refinancing at longer maturities, it remains high
(16 percent of GDP in 2006, declining to 12 percent of GDP by 2011).
3.
Other balance sheet vulnerabilities persist, albeit significantly reduced, which
could pose risks to the public sector debt sustainability outlook. In the 2002 crisis, a large
share of the increase in public debt was attributable to emergency assistance provided to public
banks, which faced sharp deposit withdrawals and an increase in nonperforming loans. Today,
corporations remain still largely liability dollarized, with foreign currency debt representing
65 percent of total liabilities, on average, at end-2005. Also, in the financial system
dollarization and short-term deposits remain high, exposing banks to risks from peso
depreciation, international interest rate increases, and foreign exchange liquidity withdrawals.
However, with high liquidity and capital, banks can withstand important market and foreign
exchange liquidity shocks better. For instance, as buffers against (i) deposit runs, banks hold
75 percent of FX deposits in liquid FX assets; (ii) interest rate risks, banks set short maturities
on FX loans and charge high interest rate spreads; and (iii) peso depreciation, banks hold more
foreign currency assets than foreign currency liabilities (2½ times), factoring in that 30 percent
of the dollar loans are extended to individuals without a stable dollar income stream.
3.
Under baseline assumptions, Uruguay’s public sector debt should decline
considerably over the medium term (Table 1). The baseline scenario assumes a primary
fiscal surplus of 4 percent of GDP, sustained GDP growth of 3 percent a year, a gradual
recovery of the real value of the peso vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar to 85 percent of its pre-crisis
level (from 80 percent at end-2005), and sovereign spreads remaining broadly at current levels
(assuming that less favorable market conditions would be offset by the lower country risk from
a declining debt ratio) over the medium term. Assuming net costs of BHU restructuring of

- 42 -

APPENDIX I

US$0.4 billion1 with no further contingent liabilities from bank restructuring coming due, and
no possible debt reduction from privatization proceeds, public debt would decline to just below
50 percent of GDP by 2012. With nominal debt staying broadly at the 2005 level, this reduction
would be mainly achieved through strong growth and real appreciation of the peso.
4.
Public debt remains on a declining path in the no-policy change scenario, but
when key economic variables are set at their historical averages it jumps up significantly
(Table 2). This is because by 2005, the primary balance had already moved close to its
medium-term target of 4 percent of GDP (from a deficit of 1.1 percent of GDP in 2001 to a
surplus of 3.9 percent of GDP). However, when key variables are set at their historical levels
(primary fiscal balance and growth), the debt-to-GDP ratio would increase by 20 percent
relative to baseline.
5.
Standardized bound tests show that Uruguay is vulnerable to several shocks, but
particularly exposed to exchange rate risk (Figure 1). Assuming half a standard-deviation
shocks to interest rates or growth rates, the public debt-to-GDP ratio would stay at
63–75 percent by 2011 compared to 48 percent in the baseline scenario. However, a similar
shock to the primary balance would leave the public debt-to-GDP ratio at 56 percent by 2011,
as the medium-term primary balance would still remain above 3 percent of GDP. If all three
shocks with a ¼ standard deviation were to take place at the same time, the debt-to-GDP ratio
would end up at 65 percent by 2011. However, if the exchange rate were to depreciate by
30 percent, the debt-to-GDP ratio would jump up to almost 100 percent and only decline to
about 82 percent by 2011, raising debt sustainability concerns.
Tailored scenarios
6.
Tailored scenarios are used to assess Uruguay’s overall vulnerabilities to
macroeconomic shocks. The figures below present illustrative scenarios of external, fiscal and
growth shocks to Uruguay’s debt outlook.

1

This assumes that gross debt of some US$1 billion would be partly offset by the estimated net worth of BHU’s
assets of some US$640 million. This assumes that about 60 percent of BHU’s loan portfolio (after current
provisioning) can be recovered and that cash payment on leases and proceeds from the sale of properties would
increase by about half, as a result of improved management. If asset recovery would be only 30 percent, the debtto-GDP ratio would be some 1.2 percent higher relative to baseline by 2012.

7.
Under all these macroecononomic scenarios, the financial system soundness
indicators are expected to weaken, but overall system stability would not be affected. All
scenarios were stress tested using the FSAP methodology. The findings suggest that while
banks’ profitability and loan portfolios would weaken somewhat, under the current high
liquidity and capital adequacy ratios, overall financial system stability would not be put at risk.
This however assumes that depositor confidence would be maintained.
•

Tighter international liquidity. This scenario assumes a reduction in global liquidity
(but not a sudden stop) and a sharper-than-currently-envisaged increase in U.S. interest
rates (by 200 basis points) which would increase Uruguay’s spread by some 100 basis
points.2 The resulting higher financing costs are assumed to lead to slower growth (by
½ percent relative to the baseline) and a permanent relaxation of the primary balance of
¼ percent of GDP. With lower capital inflows and lower growth the real exchange rate
is assumed to be 10 percent more depreciated than under to baseline. Under this
scenario, the public debt-to-GDP ratio by 2012 would increase to some 15 percent
higher than in the baseline.

•

Slowdown in global growth and lower non-oil commodity prices. It is assumed that
global growth would slow by 1 percent relative to baseline for the years 2006–12,
causing a one-off drop in non-oil commodity prices of 10 percent.3 This would lead to a

2

Dailami et al. (2005) conclude that a 200 basis point increase in short-term U.S. interest rates increases emerging
market spreads by 64 basis points with debt-to-GDP ratios above 94 percent.
3

Uruguay’s exports are mainly in beef, which have been subject to price swings of 30 percent within two years.

- 44 -

APPENDIX I

decline in Uruguay’s exports. It is assumed that domestic growth would slow by
1 percent relative to baseline and in response the primary fiscal balance would weaken
by ¼ percent of GDP. To maintain external balance, the REER would depreciate by
some 5 percent relative to baseline. The public debt-to-GDP ratio however would stay at
58 percent by 2012, 10 percent above baseline.
•

A relaxation of fiscal discipline. This scenario assumes that higher domestic spending
pressures would weaken the fiscal position, implying a primary surplus of 1 percent of
GDP (compared to 4 percent of GDP in the baseline). While this may raise near-term
growth somewhat, the scenario assumes growth in line with baseline, as higher
financing needs and country risk would reduce medium-term growth prospects. Interest
rate spreads are assumed to increase by 200 basis points, and the REER to depreciate by
5 percent relative to baseline, reflecting lower capital inflows. As a result, the debt-toGDP ratio in 2012 would be at 61 percent, 12 percentage points above baseline
projections.

•

A strengthening of the overall growth outlook. This scenario assumes that the
government accelerates the implementation of a comprehensive structural reform
agenda, leading to substantial increases in private investment and an increase of
potential growth by 1 percentage point, to 4 percent. This in turn is assumed to reduce
country spreads by 50 basis points and to contribute to a further appreciation of the real
exchange rate by some 5 percent relative to baseline. As a result, the debt-to-GDP ratio
would decline to 40 percent by 2012.

1/ Net of free reserves and monetary policy instruments.
2/ This does not reflect the planned strengthening of the BCU finances (SB for November 2006) yet.
The overall fiscal position will not be affected as interest costs of the central bank would be shifted to the government.
3/ Includes in 2006 the funding of the deposit insurance scheme of US$20 million and assumption of the BHU liabilities of US$407 million (net),
of which US$895 million are in form of non-cash liabilities and US$488 in form of financial assets (assumed recovery rate of 60 percent).
4/ In 2006: assumption of BHU financial obligations and cancellation of BHU deposits.

1/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.
2/ Framework covers the public sector (net of free reserves and monetary policy instruments).
3/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; a = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
4/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 3/ as r - p (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
5/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 3/ as ae(1+r).
6/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
7/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
8/ The key variables include real GDP growth and primary balance in percent of GDP.
9/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.

Real GDP growth (in percent)
Average nominal interest rate on public debt (in percent) 9/
Average real interest rate (nominal rate minus change in GDP deflator, in percent)
Nominal appreciation (increase in US dollar value of local currency, in percent)
Inflation rate (GDP deflator, in percent)
Growth of real primary spending (deflated by GDP deflator, in percent)
Primary deficit

1/ Shaded areas represent actual data.Individual shocks are permanent one-half standard deviation shocks.
Figures in the boxes represent average projections for the respective variables in the baseline and scenario being
presented. Ten-year historical average for the variable is also shown.
2/ Permanent 1/4 standard deviation shocks applied to real interest rate, growth rate, and primary balance.
3/ One-time real depreciation of 30 percent and 10 percent of GDP shock to contingent liabilities occur in 2006,
with real depreciation defined as nominal depreciation (measured by percentage fall in dollar value of local
currency) minus domestic inflation (based on GDP deflator).

Safeguards Assessment: The authorities have already implemented many of the
recommendations from the safeguards assessment conducted under the current SBA,
completed in September 2005. In particular, (i) Uruguay's total obligations to the Fund
are now included in the BCU's financial statements; (ii) data submitted to the Fund is
periodically reviewed for consistency with the Technical Memorandum of
Understanding; and (iii) the criteria for the selection and appointment of the BCU's
external audit firm have been amended in line with the safeguards recommendation

Exchange Rate Arrangement: The currency is the Uruguayan peso (Ur$). Uruguay has
followed an independently floating exchange rate regime since July 29, 2002. On

Except for 2006, this schedule is not the currently applicable schedule of payments to the
IMF. Rather, the schedule presents all payments to the IMF under the illustrative assumption
that repayment expectations would be extended to their respective obligation dates by the IMF
Executive Board upon request of the debtor country.

June 12, 2006, buying and selling interbank rates for the U.S. dollar, the intervention
currency, were Ur$23.80 and Ur$23.87, respectively. Uruguay’s exchange system is
free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions. The
exchange restriction associated with the reprogramming of time deposits at BROU and
BHU during the 2002 crisis was removed ahead of schedule in April 2005.

APPENDIX III

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
(As of June 9, 2006)
The World Bank Board of Executive Directors approved a new Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) on June 9, 2005. The CAS envisages a base case scenario of up to US$800 million in
new lending over the period FY05–10. The lending program will be modulated on the strength
of the Government’s program and its ability to implement it, as well as the evolution in the
country’s creditworthiness.
The Bank’s strategy in the new CAS is anchored around a series of programmatic
development loans that are expected to be multi-sectoral in focus and support the Government
in key policy areas including public sector management, financial sector reform, and reform of
social programs. The CAS also proposes to rebuild the investment portfolio with new
operations planned to support priority investments in infrastructure, social programs and
innovation. Two investment operations for Integrated Natural Resources and Transport
Infrastructure and Rural Access, in the amount of US$30 million and US$70 million
respectively were approved by the Board on June 9, 2005 together with the CAS.
The previous Country CAS was approved on May 5, 2000 and a CAS Progress Report on
July 25, 2002. Following the 2002 crisis, the Bank increased its financial support, shifting to a
high case lending scenario of US$550 million for fiscal years 2002–04, concentrated in
adjustment lending. A Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL I) and a Special Structural
Adjustment Loan (SSAL I) were approved with the CAS Progress Report, totaling
US$303 million, to assist Uruguay in addressing structural weaknesses and in managing the
economic crisis. On April 8, 2003, another structural adjustment package (SAL II and SSAL
II) was approved totaling US$252.5 million, focusing on improving public services and human
development policies. Progress in implementation of SAL I and SSAL I has been satisfactory,
and the last tranches in an aggregate amount of US$100 million (US$50 million of SAL I and
US$50 million of SSAL I) were released in October 2004.
In the context of the new CAS, the Government has reaffirmed its commitment to the
objectives of SAL II taking into account the results of the 2003 referenda on petroleum
products and water. With regard to SSAL II, the objectives of the program have been achieved
and, with the immediate crisis over and the beginning of a new CAS period, the outstanding
second and third tranches of this operation have been cancelled at the Government’s request.
The social reform agenda continues to be supported by a new development policy loan
(DPL1), approved by the Board of Executive Directors together with the CAS on
June 9, 2005. The DPL1 in an amount of US$75 million supports reform progress in social
policies over the last two years, as well as early but important measures that the new
Government has taken with respect to health, education and social protection. The DPL1 has
been fully disbursed.
The current investment portfolio comprises eight projects totaling US$389.5 million in
commitments, with an undisbursed amount of US$136.0 million as of June 9, 2006. The

- 56 -

APPENDIX III

performance of the investment portfolio has improved significantly in CY04 and CY05, with
disbursements for investment operations aggregating to US$43.8 million and US$58.6 million
respectively. This is a reflection of the substantially improved economic situation, as well
closer portfolio monitoring, with portfolio performance reviews being conducted every six
months.

APPENDIX IV

RELATIONS WITH THE INTER-AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of May 22, 2006)
The Inter-American Development Board of Executive Directors approved a new Country
Strategy for Uruguay on March 15, 2006. The Bank’s Country Strategy supports the
Government’s policy, which seeks to consolidate growth and improve the population’s social
welfare. In support of this longer-term goal, the Strategy focuses on the following priority
areas: (i) improving public sector management, to increase its efficiency and efficacy, while
supporting fiscal and debt sustainability; (ii) enhancing regional and international
competitiveness of domestic output and encouraging private investment in order to promote
sustainable growth; and (iii) reducing poverty and increasing social inclusion.
The implementation of the Bank’s strategy proposes a likely lending scenario of about
US$950 million for the five-year period 2005–09, which together with a normal execution of
the loan portfolio, mainly investment projects, will allow for the net lending flows to remain
relatively neutral. The lending program for 2005–06 and a tentative program for the later
years––2007-09––was agreed with the new authorities during the Bank’s Programming
Mission on August 22, 2005. This program includes lending to support the Government in
the key policy areas of competitiveness, the social sectors, and public sector management. To
this end, during 2005 a loan for a program to support the productivity and development of
new livestock products, for US$15.8 million, was approved in July; a social sector loan for
US$250 million was approved in August, to support the development and implementation of
Government’s social policy aimed at reducing poverty, improving the human resource base
among the poor, and strengthening the sector’s institutional framework; and a loan to support
the public debt management unit for US$2.45 million was approved in November. An
investment project to improve cluster competitiveness for US$9 million as well as a sectoral
program to improve competitiveness for US$100 million are under preparation and are
expected to be approved in 2006 and early 2007 respectively. Within the public sector
management area, a three-year programmatic loan, to support improvements in tax
administration and public sector management, is under preparation, with expected approval
in 2006; the estimated financing for the first year amounts to US$50 million while for the
next two years the amount is to be determined. The lending program also includes investment
projects with new operations planned in the area of microfinance, to support transport
infrastructure, sanitation in Montevideo and social programs such as a neighborhood
improvement programs.
As of May 22, 2006 the Bank’s current portfolio in Uruguay includes loans for the financing
of 15 investment projects; and two policy based operations, for strengthening the banking
sector and for the social sectors. The lending portfolio, which is largely aligned to the
administration’s priorities and consistent with the Bank’s Country Strategy, amounts to
US$1,185..8 million, of which US$509.7 million are pending disbursement. Portfolio
performance in the recent past was affected by the Government’s fiscal constraint, which
entailed cuts in budgetary allocations to levels below the required amounts in order to
maintain a normal pace of project implementation. An important challenge ahead in terms of

- 58 -

APPENDIX IV

portfolio management, for both the Bank and the authorities, will be to ensure that the
projects increase the pace of project execution while setting the stage for a normal
implementation of the new projects within the context of the approved five-year Budget Law.
As part of their debt management strategy, the authorities paid in February, US$100 million
due and in March, pre paid the remaining US$300 million due in August 2006 and 2007,
corresponding to the Social Protection and Sustainability Program, that was approved in
August 2002.

APPENDIX V

URUGUAY: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Uruguay’s economic and financial database is generally adequate for the assessment and
monitoring of macroeconomic policies. Uruguay subscribed to the SDDS in February 2004,
and meets the SDDS specifications. However, Uruguay uses the flexibility option for
timeliness of central and general government operations, and the analytical accounts of the
banking sector.
Real sector statistics
National account statistics have a number of shortcomings, including the use of an outdated
benchmark year (1983), limited coverage of the enterprise survey, long publication lags,
inadequate information on the informal economy, and incomplete quarterly accounts. The
BCU compiles and disseminates annual GDP estimates in current and constant prices by the
production and expenditure approaches, as well as quarterly constant price GDP estimates by
the production and expenditure approaches. Gross national income, gross disposable income
and gross savings are also available annually. A STA multisector mission in November 1999
recommended a range of improvements including completing revision of data and methods
that had already been initiated, introduction of annually chained volume measures,
incorporation of new benchmark survey data, and compilation of quarterly estimates of GDP
at current prices.
The authorities do not provide trade price and volume indices for publication in the
International Financial Statistics (IFS).
Both the consumer and wholesale price indices are reported on a regular and timely basis for
publication in the IFS. The consumer price index has a base period of March 1997 = 100, and
the base of the wholesale price index has been updated to 2001. Coverage of the CPI is
limited to the capital city.
Government finance statistics
Official data on the central administration, the state enterprises and the social security system
are complete and current, but there are problems with the timeliness of the data on local
governments. There are also problems with the timeliness of financing and debt data reported
for inclusion in the Fund’s statistical publications. Information on a monthly and quarterly
basis for financing and debt data respectively, are disseminated on the Central Bank’s
website from 1999 onwards for the central government and total public sector. The
information reported for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook covers
transactions on revenue and expense for the consolidated central government, and the general
government’s operations on financial assets and liabilities, both in terms of flows (financing)
and stocks (debt). However, data on revenue and expense for local governments have not
been reported since 1994.

- 60 -

APPENDIX V

Monetary and financial statistics
Monetary and financial statistics are prepared in accordance with the IMF's Monetary and
Financial Statistics Manual (2000). Authorities have yet to report monetary data using the
standardized reporting forms (SRF).
In April 2003, an STA mission visited Montevideo to assist the authorities in the adequate
recording of the loans funded from the Fund for the Stabilization of the Banking System
(FSBS) in the Central Bank’s balance sheet. The mission’s recommendations have been
implemented and were reflected in the IFS June 2003 issue.
External sector statistics
Balance of payments statements are compiled and published on a quarterly basis. Data are
compiled following the recommendations of the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments
Manual (BPM5). Uruguay compiles and reports to STA quarterly data on balance of
payments and annual data on the international investment position (IIP) for publication in the
IFS and the Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook. The new surveys would also allow for
improved coverage of the private sector in the IIP.
Uruguay started disseminating the international reserves and foreign currency liquidity data
template on the Central Bank’s website in October 2003 and on the Fund’s external website
in August 2005. Monthly information on the data template has been disseminated since
August 2003 on the Central Bank’s website and January 2005 on the Fund’s external
website. The Central Bank also disseminates quarterly external debt statistics on its website,
although not in the compact format envisaged by SDDS.

ATTACHMENT I

June 13, 2006
Dear Mr. de Rato:
1.
Progress. Performance under our program continues to exceed expectations. While
we are raising our 2006 growth projection from 4 to 4½ percent, we continue to expect that
inflation this year will remain within our target range of 4½–6½ percent. Policy
implementation is going well, with solid revenue and prudent expenditure policy resulting in
a strong fiscal outturn for the first quarter; buoyant exports and capital inflows allowing the
central bank to strengthen its foreign exchange reserves beyond program targets; and strong
capital market access further improving the public debt structure. In March, we advanced
payments of all 2006 repurchases to the Fund.
2.
Performance. Preliminary data suggest that all continuous and end-March 2006
quantitative performance criteria were met, some with wide margins; final data will be
available prior to the Board meeting. We have also made significant progress in the
implementation of our ambitious structural reform agenda, including with the recent sale of
Nuevo Banco Comercial and the preparation of a new bankruptcy law, which is about to be
submitted to Congress (both benchmarks for end-June). Also, the timetable for the
implementation of the recommendations of the growth commission has recently been
published (end-March benchmark). Contrary to our earlier expectations, Congress decided to
consider the tax reform prior to the police pension and financial sector reforms. Thus, we
now expect its approval earlier than previously programmed, while the approval of the police
pension reform (end-May performance criterion) and financial sector reform (end-June
performance criterion) will be delayed to the second half of 2006.
3.
Issues for this review. We remain committed to the policies and objectives as
presented in our Letter of Intent and Supplementary Memorandum of Economic and
Financial Policies dated March 13, 2006, and would like to draw your attention to the
following points:
•

Fiscal policy. We are confident to achieve our 2006 primary surplus target of
3.7 percent of GDP. We have identified investment in telecommunication and
highways, as two new projects under the program’s fiscal targets adjustor of
¼ percent of GDP.

•

Monetary policy. We remain committed to the 4½–6½ percent inflation target range
for 2006, in the context of a flexible exchange rate arrangement. With indications of a
continued strength in money demand, we have raised our indicative base money
growth target for December 2006 to 28 percent. However, we will monitor inflation
closely and stand ready to tighten, as necessary. We will reassess the appropriateness
of our money targets at the time of the next review.

- 63 -

ATTACHMENT I

•

International reserves. With a stronger than previously expected balance of
payments, we have increased our end-2006 reserve accumulation target by US$410
million. In addition, we will further increase this target later in the year to the extent
that this can be accommodated within the base money target and without
compromising the inflation objective.

•

Structural reforms. Although the agenda for structural reforms is a busy one, we are
determined to make additional progress in the period ahead. In particular,
•

FSAP. We remain committed to continue reducing financial sector
vulnerabilities, including by further enhancing financial sector supervision. After
we have had a chance to study in detail the recommendations of the Financial
Sector Assessment Program, we hope to discuss new measures in the context of
the next review.

•

Growth agenda. Many of the recommendations of the Growth Commission are
already in the program. As additional measures, we plan to establish a private
sector relations office at the Ministry of Finance and to reform government
procurement procedures.

4.
Waivers and new conditionality. In light of continued strong performance and in
support of the program objectives, we request: (i) a waiver of nonobservance of the
performance criterion on police pension reform and its resetting for end-October 2006;
(ii) modification of the performance criterion on the tax reform, moving the implementation
date to September 15, 2006 and of the performance criterion on financial sector legislation,
moving the implementation date to end-November 2006; and (iii) modification of the endJune monetary performance criteria and targets and setting the ones for end-September and
end-December 2006; and (iv) two new benchmarks in the growth area. The next reviews will
be completed by August and November 2006, covering overall program performance and
observance of the associated conditionality (Tables 1 and 2).
5.
Request for purchase. In requesting the completion of the Fourth Review under the
stand-by arrangement and purchase of SDR 85.82 million, we note that we remain committed
to maintaining a close policy dialogue with the Fund and stand ready to take additional
measures as appropriate to ensure the achievement of the program's objectives. Should the
external position turn out significantly stronger than we currently anticipate, we will consider
making advanced repurchases or treating the arrangement as precautionary in the future.
Sincerely yours,

Statement by the MF Staff Representative
June 28, 2006

Since the issuance of the staff report, the following additional information has become
available. It does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
1.
Performance Criteria. Final data (unchanged from staff report) confirm all endMarch 2006 quantitative performance criteria were observed.
2.
Economic growth. Real GDP grew 6.8 percent in the year ending in March 2006,
suggesting that the 4.6 percent growth rate envisaged for 2006 may be exceeded.
3.
Bankruptcy law. The law is expected to be submitted to congress with a small delay,
in early July, as more time was needed for its legal review and incorporation of comments
received during its public consultation (end-June benchmark).

context of a supportive external environment, strong macroeconomic policies and
implementation of an ambitious structural reform agenda that have resulted in impressive
economic and financial outturns and a return in market confidence in Uruguay’s prospects.
Real GDP is now above pre-recession level, and expected to continue to grow at 4½ percent
in 2006. Cautious monetary management within a flexible exchange rate regime has
contributed to a rapid decline in inflation, but—after falling below the central bank’s target
range of 5½–7½ percent in 2005—inflation has recently picked up, particularly reflecting a full
pass-through of oil prices and drought related food price increases.
Uruguay’s combined public sector primary balance has strengthened rapidly and in 2005
reached 3.9 percent of GDP, well above the 3.5 percent of GDP target. In December 2005,
congress approved a five-year budget consistent with the 4 percent of GDP medium-term
primary surplus target. The strong fiscal performance, combined with a recovery of the peso

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

and strong growth, has helped Uruguay to bring down its public debt from 105 at end-2003 to
70 percent of GDP at end-2005.
Uruguay’s external position has also strengthened considerably. Sovereign spreads have
dropped significantly, and faster than emerging market trends. With strong exports, the current
account only posed a modest deficit in 2005, despite a sharp increase in imports. Favorable
global market conditions and the return of capital have contributed to an appreciation of the
peso, and the central bank has started to intervene to build reserves, which reached
US$3.4 billion in May 2006. The government has also taken advantage of these favorable
external conditions to improve the public debt structure by increasing the share of domestic
currency debt and lengthening maturities, and has already started to prefinance some of its
2007 external financing needs.
Financial soundness indicators have strengthened significantly. The government has made
good strides in restructuring the domestic banking system and enhancing supervision. Overall,
banks are well-capitalized and have excess liquidity, and profitability has started to return, but
state-dominance in the financial system remains large. A Financial Sector Assessment
Program was carried out for Uruguay, the results of which were discussed at the Board.
Notwithstanding these strong performances, which have helped in the context of the favorable
global environment to reduce near-term risks, significant underlying vulnerabilities remain,
including the still high and dollarized public debt, large gross financing needs, as well as
regional dependencies. Also, the banking system remains highly dollarized, banking
intermediation is still well below pre-crisis level and deposits are overwhelmingly at short
maturities. Addressing those vulnerabilities was the focus of the Article IV consultation.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Uruguayan authorities for their strong policies which,
supported by generally favorable external conditions, have led to a vigorous economic
recovery from the 2002 financial crisis and a considerable decline in short-term risks. Directors
were reassured by the authorities’ continued commitment to implement strong macroeconomic
policies in order to help reduce, over time, the declining though still high public debt and
financial dollarization, and thereby address the remaining medium-term vulnerabilities.
Directors stressed that strong primary fiscal surpluses have been central to the authorities’
success in helping to reduce the public debt to GDP ratio and boost market confidence.
Continuation of these efforts will be needed to lower the still high debt ratio to more
comfortable levels. Directors stressed the importance of the impending tax reform, which will
improve the fairness and efficiency of the tax system, and called on the authorities to continue
improving tax administration to meet their ambitious revenue targets in the years ahead.
The decline in inflation to single digits is a major achievement. Directors considered that the
pursuit of a prudent monetary policy within a flexible exchange rate regime has allowed the
authorities to manage successfully the remonetization of the economy and the large capital

3
inflows. They cautioned, however, that inflation risks have increased in 2006, and urged the
authorities to adjust monetary policy as needed to meet inflation objectives. Many Directors
welcomed the proposed new central bank law aimed at increasing its autonomy as a
significant step toward the medium-term introduction of an inflation-targeting framework that
would underpin the commitment to low inflation and thus anchor expectations. More broadly,
Directors encouraged the authorities to increase further the transparency of the monetary and
exchange rate policy framework in order to help the market better understand the actions of
the central bank.
Directors welcomed the restored exchange rate flexibility after periods of rigidity in early 2006.
They regarded some intervention to take advantage of capital inflows as appropriate, as it
allows for an increase in international reserves, which are still low for a dollarized economy.
However, building up reserves should not sacrifice exchange rate flexibility.
Directors stressed that sustaining high growth will be critical to improve social conditions,
ensure fiscal and debt sustainability, and support a healthy financial system. They welcomed
the authorities’ pro-growth agenda and encouraged them to continue improving the investment
climate. Directors supported the authorities’ policies aimed at furthering the expansion and
diversification of trade.
Directors highlighted the significant progress made in the financial sector. They welcomed that
banks have increased their liquidity and capitalization buffers and are significantly more
resilient to market risks. Directors urged the authorities to create a level playing field between
state and private banks, and to develop further their reform agenda in consultation with the
Fund and the World Bank. They looked forward to the early approval of the financial sector
reform law, which would address a number of the vulnerabilities identified by the staff.
Directors also welcomed the passage of AML/CFT legislation.
Directors supported the authorities’ reprioritization of reforms, and encouraged them to
undertake further reforms to improve the effectiveness of public spending and public enterprise
performance. While Uruguayan demographics rule out large declines in pension outlays,
Directors saw scope for increasing the efficiency of the general pension scheme. Some
Directors expressed concern about slippages in reforming the specialized pension funds
schemes. Directors supported the authorities’ plan to improve infrastructure through publicprivate partnerships, while recommending that the authorities start with small projects to build
expertise in managing the associated risks. Directors urged the authorities to continue with
public enterprise reforms to improve service delivery. They commended the authorities on the
steps they have taken to improve public debt management.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Press Release No. 06/146
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
June 28, 2006

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Completes Fourth Review Under Uruguay's Stand-By Arrangement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) completed today the fourth
review under the three-year, SDR 766.25 million (about US$1.13 billion) Stand-By Arrangement
for Uruguay (see Press Release No. 05/136). Completion of this review makes an additional SDR
85.8 million (about US$ 126.2 million) immediately available to Uruguay.
In completing the review, the Board granted a waiver for the non-observance of the performance
criterion on police pension reform and its resetting for end-October 2006; the modification of the
performance criterion on tax reform; and the modification of the end-June monetary performance
criteria and targets.
In commenting on the Board review, Mr. Agustín Carstens, Deputy Managing Director and
Acting Chair, said:
“Uruguay's recent economic performance under the Stand-By Arrangement, and the outlook for
2006, remain strong. Sound economic policies and market confidence in Uruguay’s prospects, a
strengthened external position, and an improved debt structure have helped the economy weather
well the recent volatility in international financial markets. The authorities remain committed to
continue implementing forward-looking policies to address medium-term vulnerabilities,
including the high public debt and widespread financial dollarization.
“Robust growth provides Uruguay an opportunity to strengthen further its fiscal position.
Exceeding the 2006 fiscal target is desirable, as it would help further lower the high public debt,
control inflation, and moderate appreciation pressures. Efforts to strengthen tax administration
and fully pass through international oil prices will also be important in this regard. In addition,
approval of the tax reform, with its revenue-neutral and base-broadening elements, will be a key
step toward improving the efficiency and equity of Uruguay’s tax system.
“Monetary policy has successfully brought inflation to single digits in an environment
complicated by remonetization and large capital inflows. The central bank's focus on building up
reserves, while maintaining appropriate exchange rate flexibility, is well placed. The recent
pickup in inflationary pressures is being monitored carefully, and the authorities stand ready to
tighten monetary policies should developments suggest that the end-2006 target range could be
missed.

-2-

“Financial sector reforms are progressing well. A financial sector bill currently under the
Congress’ consideration will, once approved, address several improvements identified by the
government in consultation with the Fund and the World Bank.
“Looking ahead, Uruguay’s key challenge will be to implement crucial structural reforms over
the next months—including the tax, financial sector, and pension reforms currently before
Congress. Over the medium term, the authorities should continue with the sustained
implementation of strong macroeconomic polices, while persevering with steps to improve the
business climate and strengthen labor market flexibility. Together, these will reduce
vulnerabilities further and lay the basis for lasting growth,” Mr. Carstens said.

Statement by Hector Torres, Executive Director for Uruguay
and David Vogel, Advisor to Executive Director
June 28, 2006
Background
1.
Uruguay’s economy keeps showing a satisfactory performance, which is based on
sound pillars of prudent macroeconomic policies, structural reforms, and proper incentives
established by the authorities’ measures. Thus, Uruguay’s government continues going
forward with its objectives of higher and sustainable growth, high level and better quality of
employment, and more social equity.
Recent Economic Developments
2.
In the first quarter of the year, GDP increased robustly (7.2 percent) compared to the
same period in 2005. In this broad-based growth there have been outstanding performances
as in industry (increase of 18 percent) and construction (16 percent). Meanwhile, investment
(33 percent) and exports (10 percent) are leading the activity expansion. At the same time it
is important to note that private consumption increased by a healthy 6.4 percent, showing
upward trend rates. This reflects higher consumer confidence, consistent with the prudent
expenditure policies that will make possible a new tax system which, whereas permitting a
more equitable and efficient distribution, will not impose a higher tax burden.
3.
Inflation is within the target range established by the Central Bank for September
2006 (5-7 percent). Admittedly, inflation rates have risen in recent months reflecting the full
pass-through of oil prices, along with the effect on food prices of a drought that is currently
receding. However, the Central Bank is following these developments closely and is ready to
take all adjustments in monetary policy that may be needed to meet the Central Bank’s
inflation target. Meanwhile, the authorities are adhering to a flexible exchange rate system,
even though, if necessary, they will intervene to mitigate possible short-term volatility due to
large capital inflows. This approach is clearly supported by the staff’s assessment on
competitiveness. At the same time, we would like to reiterate that our authorities have no
exchange rate target and are determined to avoid signaling the existence of any.
4.
Primary surplus in 2005 exceeded the authorities’ target, and the same behavior has
been observed during this year, with figures approaching to the government’s medium-term
targets. It is important to note that the social emergency plan, although it was not fully
implemented in 2005 because of temporary delays, has been critical to allow the country to
reduce the poverty rate by three percentage points, generating more social inclusion and a
better environment for reforms.
5.
Strong fiscal performance has made possible a steady and ambitious reduction of the
debt-to-GDP ratio that is currently already under the 70 percent figure. Admittedly this is

2
still a high ratio that needs to be further reduced, but it is far below the ratio observed less
than three years ago (105 percent). Meanwhile, the recently created Debt Management Unit
continues to make efforts to further reduce debt cost, increase maturities, and diminish
exchange rate risks.
6.
Our authorities do not fully agree with the staff on some assessments regarding
underlying vulnerabilities. In particular, comparisons among different countries’ reserves
relative to short-term debt and foreign exchange deposits does not take duly into account
different circumstances. For instance, unlike what happened to other countries in the region,
when Uruguay underwent the climax of its 2002 financial crisis, foreign-owned banks
responded to deposit withdrawals with their own reserves. The Central Bank did not have to
assist those banks with its reserves. Moreover, all of the private banks are currently owned
by first rank international banks, accounting for about the half of the banking system assets.
Meanwhile, it is a little bit strange that the staff report underscores the bunching of maturities
on debt exchange falling due 2022 and 2033 as a vulnerability without recalling that the debt
exchange itself was a big success.
Our Authorities’ Firm Commitment to Structural Changes
7.
A long series of efforts over the last sixteen months clearly reflect the government’s
strong ownership of the reforms. In the Uruguayan government’s view reforms must be
lasting and well-implemented, which requires an adequate discussion in Congress, and a
good dissemination and explanation to the people about the benefits that such changes will
bring about. This is the reason why the authorities have preferred to introduce some minor
variations to their comprehensive structural agenda.
8.
As in any democratic country, in Uruguay the Congress is free to schedule priorities
and the time it needs to consider each of the bills that are put forward by the Administration.
In this regard, it has decided to consider our authorities’ core reform, the new tax system,
prior to other reforms. We are confident that the small time adjustment that we are
requesting will help the Congress to better discuss reforms whose architectures are quite
sophisticated.
Further Inserting Uruguay into the Global Economy
9.
Another critical structural issue involves Uruguay’s further insertion into the global
economy. The Uruguayan government gives high priority to trade diversification since it
will allow Uruguay to continue minimizing its dependency on one region. In this respect we
would like to stress the significant improvement made since 1998 when exports to Mercosur
represented 55 percent of total exports in goods whereas this percentage was reduced to just
23 percent in 2005. Consequently, Nafta countries’ share is showing an expansion
(7.5 percent in 1998 and 29 percent in 2005), as is Europe (18 percent in 1998 compared to
20 percent in 2005). Furthermore, since the recent visit of the President of Uruguay to the
United States of America, a process towards deepening trade relations between both

3
countries has begun, which would complement the investment agreement ratified by the
Uruguayan Congress in December 2005. Uruguay has already signed a Free Trade
Agreement with Mexico, and will continue efforts to negotiate trade agreements with many
other countries in order to diversify not only markets but also Uruguay’s export product base.
Reforming and Establishing Proper Incentives in the Financial System
10.
After a deep economic and financial crisis as the one Uruguay suffered in 2002, it
takes some time to rebuild confidence, putting together a strong banking sector with reduced
vulnerabilities. However, there has been a steady and substantial improvement in confidence
and the system is already harvesting benefits from an important number of structural
changes. While the financial system still presents a high proportion of sight deposits, this is
mainly due to the fact that demand for credit is still low. In this context, the banking sector
has not had strong incentives to offer high interest rates to attract longer-term deposits, which
in turn affects depositors’ decisions. This situation is no different from many other
experiences of post-crisis recoveries in which bank credit tends to pick-up with some delay.
In Uruguay, something similar has occurred. While credit is starting to delineate a slightly
positive trend, it is expected that the continuation of macroeconomic stability and,
particularly, the projected reforms in the financial system and capital market (many of which
are included in the staff recommendations made in Chapter IV of the Selected Issues report)
will allow the Uruguayan economy to enjoy a higher access to finance.
11.
Much greater confidence in the system can be observed in some indicators and
events, but we would like to underscore two of them. First, the episode of Cofac – negative
in itself – was isolated and did not have any effect on the rest of the financial system.
Second, the privatization process of Nuevo Banco Comercial (NBC) was successfully
completed. It is important to recall that NBC was created after the 2002 financial crisis with
the good assets of three failed banks, and approximately three years later the process was
concluded after arranging a very convenient operation, considering the buyers’ reputation
and the fair price. As our authorities have underscored, this operation continues to
demonstrate investor confidence in Uruguay, and particularly in its financial system.

12.
We would like to reaffirm that our authorities are fully aware that much more remains
to be done to further improve the financial system and mitigate remaining vulnerabilities. In
this regard, as recognized by the staff, recent efforts include the significant strengthening of
the regulation and supervision of the financial system. Likewise, the government continues
progressing towards critically transforming Banco Hipotecario del Uruguay (BHU) into a
viable institution. Regarding Banco de la Republica Oriental del Uruguay (BROU) our
authorities are setting aside dogmatic approaches (“public banks are intrinsically good, or
intrinsically bad”). For them it is good governance that counts most. The existence of a
strong public bank based on sound pillars should not discourage private competence but

4
rather entice it while serving the interests of the country and its people. In this vein, the
authorities continue making significant advancements, among others, in risk management
and internal controls.
13.
The Uruguayan government aims to reinforce habits of honoring debts and, in
general, accountability on both sides, banks and their customers. It is important to recall that
over the last decades, many laws have been passed establishing debt refinancing with lax
conditions for the generality of debtors. Our authorities have underscored that they are
firmly committed to break these kind of detrimental solutions, and that policies will not
reward those who are unwilling to honor their debts, waiting for the next debt amnesty.
Instead, the reward will be aimed at encouraging people to meet their obligations, hence
avoiding a burden on the whole community.
Further Improving the Investment Climate
14.
Considering the critical need for Uruguay to attract private investment, our
authorities’ strategy is designed to forge a favorable investment climate. As noted by the
staff, after completing the work of the growth commission (Compromiso Nacional), our
authorities have incorporated many of the identified measures in their agenda, which will
help them to fulfill their objectives. In this regard, the creation of an investor relations office
at the Ministry of Economy, and the adoption of a detailed plan to strengthen government
procedures have been incorporated as new structural benchmarks. These will add to other
critical reforms such as a new bankruptcy law.
Conclusions
15.
Despite a not entirely favorable external environment (high oil prices and a drop in
tourism due to occasional blockades of bridges connecting with Argentina) Uruguay has been
showing a very positive performance –outstanding if compared to the country’s economic
patterns during the last decades. Among other things, GDP has grown robustly, inflation has
been within the Central Bank’s target range for September 2006, fiscal performance has
exceeded original projections, and poverty – though still high – has decreased. The
authorities are fully aware that much remains to be done in all of these areas. At the same
time, the Uruguayan government has pointed out that macroeconomic achievements do not
make sense if they are not accompanied by critical reforms included in the authorities’
comprehensive agenda.
