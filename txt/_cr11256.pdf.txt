EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Background. In the context of strong commodity prices, real GDP rose by 4½ percent in
2010, up from 3 percent in 2009. The overall fiscal balance shifted from a surplus of 2.2 percent of
GDP on average during 2007–08 to a deficit of 3.3 percent during 2009–10, pushing public debt up to
21½ percent of GDP at end-2010. In January 2011, the authorities devalued the currency in the
official market by 20 percent against the U.S. dollar, bringing the rate broadly in line with that in the
parallel market. Inflation has risen sharply in recent months, following the devaluation and increases
in fuel prices. The external current account balance is estimated to have registered a surplus of about
1 percent of GDP in 2010, and international reserves stood at 4½ months of imports at end-2010.

Focus of consultation. Discussions focused on the appropriate policy mix both in the
aftermath of the devaluation, with emphasis on containing inflation expectations, and in the medium
term. Staff broadly supported the fiscal stance of the authorities, advising them to aim at a reduction
in the overall fiscal deficit of 2 percent of GDP in 2011. Staff also advised the authorities to improve
the oversight and management of key public utility companies, while implementing targeted social
support programs to cushion the adverse effects of higher inflation on the most vulnerable groups.

Exchange system. In conjunction with the devaluation, the authorities did away with an
existing multiple currency practice (MCP), in the form of a special exchange rate for imports of infant
formula. They also established a band (SRD 3.25–3.35 per US$1), within which foreign exchange
market transactions are allowed to take place. Suriname maintains MCPs subject to Fund approval
under Article VIII, Section 3.

Past surveillance. During the 2009 Article IV consultation, Directors encouraged the
authorities to avoid unsustainable increases in spending and recommended a gradual implementation
of the second phase of the wage reform (FISO-2). In the event, current and capital expenditures rose
significantly, particularly ahead of the May 2010 elections.

Mission. The team that visited Paramaribo during February 6–20, 2011 comprised
Gamal El-Masry (head), Charles Amo-Yartey, Lennart Erickson, and Yi Wu (all WHD).
Eduardo Saboia (OED) participated in the policy discussions. The team met with Vice
President Ameerali; Minister of Finance Boedhoe; Central Bank Governor Hoefdraad; Speaker of the
National Assembly Simons; Minister of Natural Resources Hok; other senior government officials;
and representatives of the private sector, labor, the diplomatic community, and the opposition.

I. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
1.
Mr. Desiré Bouterse was elected President in mid-August 2010, after his party
emerged from the May elections with the largest faction in the National Assembly. He
heads a three-party coalition government with two junior partners which were part of the
previous administration. Mr. Bouterse had previously led Suriname during the 1980s and
early 1990s.
2.
Economic growth is estimated to have risen from 3 percent in 2009 to 4½ percent
in 2010 (Figure 1). This improvement reflected primarily a rebound in the output of
Suriname’s main commodity exports (gold, petroleum, and alumina). Inflation rose from
1.3 percent at end-2009 to 10.3 percent at end-2010, following large wage increases in the
civil service, as well as higher food and fuel prices. The outgoing government implemented
the first phase of the civil service wage reform in 2009 and started implementing the second
phase of this reform in July 2010, when it awarded half of the negotiated increase; the second
half was implemented in January 2011 by the new government. Largely as a result of the
reform, the central government wage bill rose from the equivalent of 9 percent of GDP in
2008 to 10½ percent in 2010 (Box 1).
3.
The overall fiscal deficit is estimated to have shifted from a surplus of
2.2 percent of GDP during 2007–08 to a deficit of 3.3 percent of GDP during 2009–10. A
decline in tax revenue, on account of a sharp drop in corporate tax collections from the
bauxite/alumina sector associated with lower output and weaker consumption tax collections,
was offset in part by higher nontax revenue from

18 percent of GDP in 2008 to 21½ percent in
2010, it remained low by international comparison. In early 2011, the authorities raised the
legal limit for domestic debt from 15 percent of GDP to 25 percent, while lowering the
foreign debt ceiling from 45 percent of GDP to 35 percent. They argued that the new
rebalanced debt limits were more prudent, as they would reduce the country’s potential
exposure to external debt. In recent years, all external debt arrears were cleared, except for
those with the U.S. government (estimated at US$32 million, or 0.9 percent of 2010 GDP),
on which bilateral discussions have been initiated.

4
Box 1: Civil Service Wage Reform—An Update
The first phase of the civil service wage reform (FISO-1) was completed in mid-2010. Following
extensive discussions with civil service unions, in March 2009, the authorities implemented the first
of two wage reform. It aimed at re-grading the civil service along a uniform pay-scale across all
ministries and government agencies, with retroactive effect from January 1, 2008. The exercise
entailed substantive wage increases for most civil servants, who were paid double increments for a
period of 14 months.
In May 2010, the former administration began implementing the second phase of the wage
reform (FISO-2). FISO-2 was intended to decompress the wage bill by granting wage increases of
up to 45 percent to employees in the upper echelons of the civil service. Days before the May 2010
election, the outgoing government announced that FISO-2 would be implemented in two stages, with
no retroactive effect. Half of the agreed increment would be granted to qualifying employees effective
on July 1, 2010, and the second half on January 1, 2011. The fiscal impact of this phased
implementation on the 2010 budget was one-eighth of the reform originally negotiated with the
unions, which was to have been implemented in January 2010 with retroactive effect to January 2009.
Accordingly, in January 2011, the new administration granted civil servants the remaining half
of the FISO-2 wage increment. In 2011, the wage bill is expected to increase by 17 percent. The
cumulative impact of the reforms on the budget has been substantial, with the wage bill rising in
nominal terms by almost 42 percent between 2008 and 2010. Meanwhile, progress has yet to be made
on the much wider objective of streamlining the civil service and increasing its efficiency.

4.
Monetary and credit expansion
moderated in 2010. Reserve and broad money
growth, which surged in late-2009/early-2010, have
subsequently declined, following a tightening in
government spending. Twelve-month private sector
credit growth has slowed since mid-2008, to around
10 percent (y/y) at end-2010. The level of excess
reserves held by commercial banks also declined in
the second half of the year, as banks used some of
these reserves to lend to the government.

The external current account balance is estimated to have improved from a
deficit of 1 percent of GDP in 2009 to a surplus of about 1 percent of GDP in 2010.
Mineral exports have increased substantially, boosted by higher prices for all three main
exports (alumina, gold, and oil). Against the backdrop of depleted bauxite production from
current mines, the improved outlook in the aluminum sector prompted the Suriname
Aluminum Company (SURALCO) to import bauxite from neighboring Brazil, to raise its
alumina production and exports. Gross international reserves rose by US$22 million in 2010,
to US$785 million at year-end (4½ months of imports).

5
6.
In January 2011, the authorities devalued the currency by 20 percent against the
U.S. dollar in the official market, bringing it broadly in line with that in the parallel
market. The Surinamese dollar had

are to take place. In recent weeks, the value of

the Suriname dollar in the informal market has
stabilized, and it has been trading with a small
discount (less than two percent) against the official rate. In January, the authorities
eliminated the existing multiple currency practice in the form of the special exchange rate for
imports of infant formula.
7.
In the aftermath of the devaluation, the authorities introduced a number of
accompanying measures. On January 20, they raised the fuel tax by about 70 percent which,
together with the impact of the devaluation on the import price of fuel, pushed up prices at
the pump by about 40 percent. At the same time, the government extended subsidies to
transport operators. In mid-March, the government raised gasoline and diesel prices by
7½ percent and 10 percent, respectively, to reflect developments in the international market.
Following these adjustments, 12-month inflation rose from 10.3 percent in December 2010 to
18.6 percent in February 2011.
II. OUTLOOK AND RISKS
8.
The main challenge facing Suriname in the near term is to ensure that inflation
expectations return to single digit levels. As noted, the recent devaluation and fuel tax
increases have led to a surge in inflation, while the large civil service wage increases granted
over the past two years have put significant pressure on private sector wages. There is also a
risk that new revenue measures under discussion, which focus on consumption tax increases,
would add to inflationary pressures in the short run. In the context of rising international food
and fuel prices, these factors risk triggering a process of spiraling inflation.
9.
The medium-term economic outlook remains favorable. Staff expects growth to
pick up further in 2011, to about 5 percent, supported by continued buoyant commodity
prices and activity in the mineral and energy sectors. Large investments underway, or

6
expected to begin in the near future, will boost economic activity in the years ahead.1 Over
the medium term, these projects will help strengthen government revenue and improve the
balance of payments.

III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
10.
Policy discussions focused on the need to tighten fiscal and monetary policies to
stabilize public finances, contain inflation expectations, and support the exchange rate.
There was general agreement that the current boom in commodity prices provided the
authorities with an opportune window to correct the fiscal imbalances that had accumulated
during 2009–10. In addition to discussing new revenue measures proposed by the authorities,
staff highlighted the importance of reining in current expenditures—which had risen
considerably during the election cycle—to provide room for priority capital spending. The
discussions also covered the challenge of establishing a credible medium-term fiscal
framework. There was agreement that this framework should seek to save excess mineral
revenues for leaner years and future generations, while ensuring that adequate resources are
invested in human capital and infrastructure to help the economy grow and diversify.
A. Fiscal Policy
11.
Staff and the authorities agreed that achieving an improvement in the overall
deficit of about 2 percent of GDP in 2011 was a desirable objective. The recent
devaluation is expected to help improve the fiscal balance, as higher mineral revenues,
custom duties, and sales tax on imports should more than offset a projected increase in
government spending on imported goods. In addition, the authorities were in the process of
implementing the following policy actions:

1

Projects currently underway include a new refinery being built by Staatsolie at a cost equivalent to about
15 percent of 2010 GDP, while planned investments include the development of new bauxite and gold mines in
Eastern Suriname at a cost estimated at 14–16 percent of GDP.

7

Revenue. On the back of the large recent adjustments in fuel taxes, the authorities
have introduced in the National Assembly a series of revenue measures, some of which are
expected to be adopted by mid-year. These measures include: (a) higher excise taxes on
alcohol and tobacco; (b) an increase in the presumptive tax on casinos; (c) a reactivation of
the motor vehicle tax; and (d) a widening of the sales tax base and an increase in its rate.2 The
first two measures would be implemented immediately upon approval by the National
Assembly and the third one early next year.3 Approval of the increase of the sales tax rate and
the widening of the base may take more time. In addition, the authorities have embarked on a
comprehensive project to register informal gold sector operators and bring them into the tax
fold through a presumptive tax system (Box 2). Staff welcomed the authorities’ plans in these
areas, including in the gold sector, and recommended phasing in the implementation of the
motor vehicle taxes. It also encouraged the authorities to continue efforts to introduce a VAT
system in late-2012/early-2013.

Expenditure. The authorities concurred that it was critical to rein in current
spending, particularly on goods and services. They explained that, since they had taken office
in August 2010, they had tightened current spending considerably and started clearing the
substantial backlog of domestic payment arrears accumulated in late 2009 and early 2010.
Staff encouraged them to continue with their efforts and to introduce social support programs
targeted at the most vulnerable groups, possibly with the assistance of the IADB. The
authorities also explained that, in the wake of the devaluation, they had adopted temporary
measures aimed at offsetting in part the increase in oil prices. These measures, which the
authorities intended to review after six months, are in the form of: (a) fuel subsidies for
bakeries and for bus and boat operators; and (b) the introduction of an income tax credit.
Staff advised the authorities to target the planned income tax credit to ensure that it mainly
benefits low-income groups.

Financing. Given the authorities’ plans to increase foreign borrowing from
multilateral agencies to finance capital projects, the lower deficit level would practically
eliminate the need for central bank financing of the budget. It would also allow the
government to repay domestic arrears, while providing sufficient room for commercial banks
to expand credit to the private sector.

See Appendix I for estimates of additional revenue from these measures and their impacts on inflation.

In the event, the increase in the casino tax was approved by the National Assembly on March 31, 2011.

8
Box 2. Bringing Order to the Informal Gold Sector
In February 2011, the government of Suriname kicked off a comprehensive program to
bring order to the informal gold sector. This program is overseen directly by the President’s
Office, pulling in the resources of the security forces and various line ministries, with a view to
enforcing laws and regulations, educating local operators about the impact of gold mining on the
environment, and asking informal operators to contribute a fair share of their income to the
government. The campaign covers three interrelated areas:


Registration of informal gold operators. Many gold diggers operate without proper
authorization or documentation, as squatters on land licensed to local and foreign companies
and individuals. For a limited period of time, these operators will be invited to come forward
and acquire proper documentation allowing them to operate within the law.



Government extension services. The methods used by informal operators to mine and
extract gold are very destructive to the forest, the environment, and the health of local
communities. In particular, mercury, a highly toxic metal, is widely used by artisanal miners.
It is inhaled as vapor when operators torch gold-mercury amalgam, and is discharged in
rivers and waterways where it accumulates in fish, a staple source of protein for the local
population. The posting of representatives of the Ministries of Health, the Environment, and
Justice and Police closer to local communities is expected to help better serve and educate
registered gold miners in the areas of basic health and hygiene, and introduce more efficient
and less toxic methods of mining. A higher presence of law-enforcement officers should also
help address the communities’ security and judicial concerns.



Taxation. While the informal gold sector is estimated to have exported US$600–700 million
in gold during 2010, it contributed about US$1 million (0.2 percent of gross sales) to the
government, in the form of royalties. The new presumptive tax system introduced by the
government would tax the operators of large and visible mining machines, based on the
average yields of these devices. The objective would be to raise government collections to
4–5 percent of gross gold sales over the medium term.

12.
Staff called for improvements in the management of key public utility
companies. The state oil company Staatsolie, which is highly profitable and an important
contributor to government revenue, has embarked on a large investment program (Box 3).
However, the public water and electricity companies are operating at losses, and their tariffs
have not been raised for many years, despite sharp increases in energy and wage costs. These
enterprises also hold large payments arrears on their books, both to and from other
government agencies, and staff encouraged the government to regularize this complex web of
payments obligations. Staff also recommended that the operations of the public utility
companies be conducted on a commercial basis, including by adjusting their tariff structures
and making them more progressive. The authorities shared staff’s views and explained that,
to this end, they were seeking technical and financial assistance from multilateral institutions,
including the IADB and the European Investment Bank.

9
Box 3. Staatsolie
Staatsolie, the state oil company established in December 1980, is the dominant player in the
petroleum sector in Suriname. It is involved in all aspects of exploration, production, refining, and
marketing of crude oil, and owns a 14-megawatt power plant (operating since 2006). The company is
also working to develop renewable energy sources, such as bio-fuel and hydropower. It acts as the
government’s agent in the petroleum sector and is responsible for assessing and offering open blocks
for exploration to foreign oil companies, negotiating contracts, and supervising their execution.
Staatsolie is a major contributor to fiscal revenue, exports, and GDP. Its total revenue
contributions peaked at US$198 million in 2009 (including a delayed dividend payment), equivalent
to one-third of government tax revenue. Staatsolie’s crude oil output reached 5.9 million barrels in
2009, with proven reserves estimated at 78.9 million barrels as of end-2009. Its exports amounted to
around US$260 million in 2010.1 The oil sector has so far been dominated by onshore production, but
there are active offshore test drillings by foreign companies under production-sharing contracts with
Staatsolie.

Sources: Ministry of Finance, Staatsolie and IMF staff estimates.

Staatsolie has been making substantial capital investments in recent years to expand its
production capacity. Its investment and exploration program for 2008–2012 amounts to
US$1 billion, of which US$330 million were spent during the first three years. About 70 percent of
the investment is to be financed through its cash flow savings, and the remainder through borrowing
(it has raised US$55 million through a domestic placement of U.S. dollar bonds and US$235 million
through a private placement with international banks). About 60 percent of Staatsolie’s investment
will be geared toward the construction of a new refinery and the development of a domestic
distribution network. Other areas of investments include ongoing exploration and drilling,
construction of storage tanks, and power generation.
___________________________
1
About half of Staatsolie’s crude oil production is sold domestically to SURALCO, which uses it to
generate energy to run its alumina refining plant, and the remainder is exported.

13.
With respect to medium-term fiscal policies, staff and the authorities agreed on
the aim of reducing the non-mineral deficit by 4–5 percentage points of GDP. Staff
recommended using the current upswing in the business cycle to strengthen the structure of
public finances. Staff also noted that grant disbursements from the Netherlands Treaty Funds
would run out by end-2012, presenting the authorities with the challenge of generating new

10
sustainable domestic revenues to replace this hitherto reliable source of revenue.4 The staff
elaborated a medium-term illustrative scenario that was predicated on generating additional
revenues, particularly in the non-mineral sector, while maintaining prudent expenditure
policies.5 Saving mineral revenues during surplus years, while allowing for sufficient capital
investments, would help ensure the sustainability of public finances. Given that the current
and planned investments in the mineral sector are expected to raise output levels
considerably over the medium term, it would also be important for the government to save
the expected large increase in revenue for future generation. Staff encouraged the authorities
to initiate a national dialogue with social partners with a view to forging a national consensus
on the structures and institutions that would be established to manage these resources. The
authorities agreed and explained that, to this end, they had started preliminary discussions
and analyses on establishing appropriate reserve funds. In this context, staff welcomed the
authorities’ efforts to strengthen their capacity in managing public finance with the assistance
of CARTAC and the IADB.
B. Monetary, Exchange Rate, and Financial Sector Policies
14.
Given the recent surge in inflation, staff encouraged the authorities to be ready
to tighten monetary policy, if needed. The authorities noted that the price increases in early
2011 reflected primarily the pass-through effect of higher fuel taxes and international oil
prices to the domestic market. They noted that the increase in food prices had remained
relatively small, and observed that the value of the currency in both the official and parallel
markets had stabilized since end-January. The central bank indicated that, if needed, it would
be ready to sell government paper to commercial banks, in an effort to mop up excess
liquidity. Staff noted that, if this were to prove insufficient to anchor inflation expectations,
the central bank should be prepared to temporarily raise reserve requirements on local
currency deposits. The authorities also agreed with staff on the need to develop indirect
instruments of monetary policy. They have requested technical assistance from the Fund in
the areas of liquidity forecasting and the conduct of open market operations.
15.
The authorities were confident that 12-month inflation would gradually abate.
Staff expressed concern that the recent sharp rise in public sector wages could drive up
wages in the private sector. While acknowledging this risk, the authorities were hopeful that
private employers and unions would be mindful of the dangers of spiraling inflation and
would conclude wage settlements that are moderate and forward looking. However, staff
discussions with private sector employers suggested that this risk was also a concern for
them.

4

Grant disbursements from the Netherlands Treaty Funds averaged 1¾ percent of GDP a year over the past
ten years.

5

See also the illustrative medium-term projections and debt sustainability analyses in Appendix II.

11
16.
Staff computations suggest that the new official exchange rate is broadly in line
with fundamentals (Appendix III). Available data indicate that the overvaluation of the
currency estimated at end-2008 has been broadly corrected by the January 2011 devaluation.
As noted, the spread between the official and parallel markets is less than two percent, and
banks have observed a significant increase in the supply of foreign exchange that has been
channeled through the banking system since the devaluation. Staff commended the
authorities for ending the multiple currency practice in the form of the special exchange rate
for imports of infant formula.
17.
Staff encouraged the authorities to move toward a more market-determined
exchange rate regime over the medium term. The authorities noted that the devaluation
and the introduction of a trading band had brought welcome calm to the foreign exchange
market, following a period of considerable volatility. They intended to monitor developments
closely over the next year or so, and were open to considering further reforms, once existing
fiscal imbalances would have been brought under control and indirect monetary policy
instruments would be in place. While staff expressed its broad agreement with the proposed
approach, it encouraged the authorities to remove the remaining MCPs.6
18.
Staff welcomed the authorities’ commitment to promote a gradual dedollarization of the banking system. In recent years, progress has been registered in
reducing the share of bank assets and liabilities

in foreign currency, especially on the credit

side. Commercial banks’ net position in foreign

currency, which has declined in recent years,
56
remains positive, and the authorities are
considering establishing prudential limits on
52
banks’ foreign currency exposures. In
48
December 2010, the central bank raised the
44
reserve requirement rate on foreign currency
Forex credit to total credit
40
deposits from 33 percent to 40 percent. The
36
central bank also plans to strengthen the
enforcement of the legislation that requires
32
Feb-05 Apr-06 Jun-07 Aug-08 Oct-09 Dec-10
commercial banks to make foreign currency
loans only to borrowers who earn revenues in
foreign currency. Regulations issued by the Ministry of Trade and Industry now require that
all goods be priced in Surinamese dollars, and the Ministry of Finance has issued guidelines

6

Suriname maintains MCPs, arising from the spread of more than 2 percent between the buying and the selling
rates in the official market for government transactions and from the possible spread of more than 2 percent
between these official rates for government transactions and those in the commercial market that can take place
within the established band.

12
under which all domestic payments made by the government for the purchase of goods and
services should be made in Surinamese dollars.
19.
Although banks are generally well capitalized and profitable, compliance with
prudential norms remains uneven. At end-2010, banks’ risk-weighted assets-to-capital
ratio averaged 12.2 percent, or above the regulatory minimum. The nonperforming loan ratio
for the banking sector as a whole has stabilized at a relatively high level (around 8 percent),
with noticeable variations across banks (NPL ratios in three small state-owned banks are
substantially higher than the average). Staff encouraged the authorities to inject capital into
two of the small state-owned banks which are undercapitalized. Staff and the authorities
agreed on the need to strengthen the supervision of the financial sector. A new banking
supervision bill is being finalized for presentation to National Assembly. The authorities also
underscored their continued interest in a Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP)
exercise, tentatively scheduled to take place by mid-2012, to help them better identify
potential problems and recommend possible remedies.
20.
In the rest of the financial sector, CLICO-Suriname was acquired by a local
firm, and efforts are underway to strengthen insurance supervision. The acquisition of
CLICO-Suriname by a local insurance company was facilitated by a government loan
(0.4 percent of GDP). CLICO-Suriname’s annuity liabilities were rescheduled at a lower
interest rate, an approach supported by a large portion of policyholders (Box 4). The
authorities concurred with staff on the importance of strengthening insurance supervision. To
this end, work is continuing with CARTAC on a new draft bill—soon to be presented to
Parliament—that would provide proper protection to insurance supervisors and strengthen
regulations on licensing, data reporting, and capital requirements.
C. Structural Issues
21.
The authorities consider that substantial capital investments are needed in the
coming years, including in the public sector, to raise the country’s growth potential.
Staff recognized the importance of the government’s investment program in infrastructure
(including in public utilities) and low-income housing. It advised the authorities to pace these
projects in line with fiscal sustainability and the country’s implementation capacity, and
recommended financing them through grants or concessional loans.
22.
The government is scheduled to restart negotiations with foreign partners on the
development of large gold and bauxite mining fields in Eastern Suriname. Staff noted
the authorities’ plans to enhance Suriname’s share in the exploitation of its natural resources
in future contracts. Suriname’s comfortable foreign reserves and low debt ratio would allow
the government to make sizeable investments in the mining sector. This would give Suriname
an opportunity to increase its share in the exploitation of the country’s natural resources and
ensure a greater flow of government revenue for the benefit of the broad population. At the
same time, staff advised that such investments be undertaken only after careful assessment of

13
their viability and within a long-term comprehensive growth strategy of diversification and
economic and environmental sustainability.
Box 4. Resolution of CLICO-Suriname
CLICO-Suriname turned insolvent when the Trinidadian conglomerate CL Financial (CLF)
collapsed. Large investments that its life insurance branch had made in other subsidiaries of CLF in
The Bahamas and in Trinidad and Tobago became nonperforming. As a result, about 7,500
policyholders of CLICO-Suriname, including banks and pension funds, were at risk of losing their
investments. In June 2009, a court approved a moratorium on all payments for a period of
18 months, following a run earlier in the year by depositors and policyholders of CLICO-Suriname.
The court order provided the authorities with sufficient time to develop a financial plan and
negotiate the sale of CLICO-Suriname with potential buyers.
In January 2010, the operations of CLICO-Suriname were taken over by a local insurance
company. Self Reliance Insurance, a company in which the government has a 40 percent stake,
took over the operations of CLICO-Suriname, backed by a loan from the government of
US$16 million (0.4 percent of 2010 GDP). This loan is non-interest bearing and could be converted
into equity, should Self Reliance’s efforts to recover its investments in CLICO-Bahamas and
CLICO-Trinidad-and-Tobago prove futile.
The annuities of CLICO-Suriname were restructured by lowering the interest rate and
extending maturities. About 80 percent of policyholders, representing 90 percent of investments,
have agreed to a renegotiation of their contracts—a pre-condition for the restructuring of annuities
and the take-over by Self Reliance. CLICO-Suriname is currently still operating as a standalone
entity and is expected to eventually be merged with Self Reliance.

23.
Staff agreed with the authorities on the need to further diversify the economy
and improve the business environment. The government’s current diversification efforts
focus on expanding agricultural production and exports (particularly rice, fruits, and
vegetables). The authorities are also making important efforts to improve the business
environment and, through streamlining of government procedures, the time needed to register
limited liability companies has been reduced substantially.7 Staff welcomed these efforts and
encouraged the authorities to review the legislative framework with a view to ensuring that
remaining unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles for the registration and issuance of licenses for
bona fide businesses and activities are removed. Staff also commended the authorities for
their efforts to improve the quality and dissemination of economic data (see Informational
Annex).

7

Suriname remains in the bottom range of the World Bank’s Doing Business Index. In June 2010, Suriname
ranked 161 out of 183 countries, down from a rank of 160 in the previous year.

14
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
24.
Suriname’s economic outlook is favorable. Growth is expected to be supported by
buoyant commodity prices and large private and public investments in the mineral and
energy sectors and in infrastructure. Over the medium term, these projects should help raise
the country’s growth potential, strengthen government revenue, and improve the balance of
payments.
25.
An immediate priority is to ensure that the recent pickup in inflation is
contained. The authorities have welcomed the narrowing of spreads between the official and
parallel market exchange rates. They are committed to tightening fiscal policy and, if needed,
monetary policy. In this context, staff underscores the importance of ensuring that wage
settlements in the private sector remain moderate and forward looking. It also encourages the
authorities to implement social support programs targeted at low-income households, whose
standard of living has been adversely affected by the rise in inflation. Staff also supports the
central bank’s intention to strengthen its capacity to conduct open market operations, with a
view to making them its main monetary policy tool.
26.
Staff supports the authorities’ plans to significantly reduce the overall fiscal
deficit in 2011. With foreign grant disbursements projected to essentially run out in the
coming years, the sustainability of public finances will require boosting revenue while
exerting control on the expenditure side. The authorities’ decision to increase indirect taxes is
welcome, as are their efforts to enhance tax collections from the informal gold sector. Staff
welcomes the authorities’ commitment to proceed with the introduction of a VAT system by
end-2012 and strengthen their capacity in managing public finance.
27.
The financial situation of key public utility companies needs improvement. Stateowned companies in the electricity and water sectors have been operating at losses for some
time, financed by transfers from the government and the accumulation of a web of domestic
payments arrears. Staff urges the authorities to move ahead decisively to reform these
companies and ensure that their operations are conducted on a commercial basis.
28.
Staff and the authorities agree on the need to strengthen the non-mineral fiscal
balance over the medium term. The authorities’ plans for a greater public share in the
exploitation of Suriname’s natural resources will require careful implementation. Staff
encourages the authorities to initiate a national dialogue to forge a consensus on the
structures and institutions that will need to be established to manage the expected rise in
mineral revenues over the medium-to-long term.
29.
Staff analyses suggest that the new official exchange rate is broadly in line with
fundamentals. Available data indicate that the overvaluation of the currency has been
broadly corrected by the January 2011 devaluation. Staff welcomes the removal of the
existing multiple currency practice and supports the authorities’ approach to review the
exchange rate arrangement over the coming year, once existing fiscal imbalances have been

15
brought under control and indirect monetary policy instruments are in place. In the absence
of a firm timetable, staff does not recommend Board approval of the remaining multiple
currency practices.
30.
Staff supports the authorities’ plans to strengthen banking supervision. Although
the banking system appears strong, nonperforming loan ratios are elevated. In this
connection, staff agrees with the authorities that an early FSAP exercise would help better
assess strengths and weaknesses in the banking sector. The resolution of CLICO-Suriname is
a welcome development, and staff is encouraged by the authorities’ efforts to strengthen the
legal framework for the supervision of the banking and insurance sectors. Staff supports the
authorities’ commitment to gradually reduce dollarization in the economy.
31.
The authorities’ efforts to improve the business environment are commendable.
Progress in this area, including by speeding up company registration and licensing processes,
will facilitate the development of a dynamic private sector. Staff also commends the
authorities for their efforts to improve the quality and dissemination of economic data.
32.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation with Suriname be held
on the standard 12-month cycle.

APPENDIX I. THE INFLATION IMPACT OF THE RECENT AND FORTHCOMING MEASURES

On January 20, the Suriname authorities devalued the official exchange rate against the
U.S. dollar by 20 percent and raised retail fuel prices by about 40 percent. The government
has also introduced a number of additional measures in the National Assembly. This note
estimates the potential impact of these measures on inflation. It should be noted that most
computations do not include second-round effects.

Summary Table (In percent)
Measures
Increase in retail fuel prices of 40 percent
Motor vehicle tax (full implementation)
Increase in sales tax on goods of 2 percent
Exchange rate devaluation of 20 percent
Increase in sales tax on services of 2 percent
New sales tax on water, energy, and gas of 12 percent
Higher sales and excise taxes on alcohol and tobacco

Inflation

1.1

Impact of the devaluation
The devaluation leads to higher customs duty and sales tax collections on imports, and
subsequently higher prices for imported goods. The most affected items in the CPI are (with
weights in brackets): “Food and Non Alcoholic Beverages” (40 percent); “Alcoholic
Beverages and Tobacco” (2.9 percent); “Clothing & Footwear” (3.6 percent); “Household
Goods Furnishings” (4.8 percent); and “Miscellaneous Goods and Services” (10.7 percent).
Assuming that half of the “Miscellaneous Goods and Services” category is composed of
goods, the total weight of these sub-indices is 56.3 percent. The 20 percent devaluation in
January 2011 is estimated to push up custom duties and sales taxes on imported consumer
goods by 20 percent, the prices of imported consumer goods by 5 percent, and CPI index as a
whole by 1.4 percent. 1

1

The computations assume that: (i) half of the goods are imported; (ii) the effective tariff on imports for
domestic consumption averages 20 percent; and (3) the price pass-through is around 100 percent (previous staff
estimates suggest a 90 percent pass-through within three months).

25
Increase in retail fuel prices
The January 2011 fuel price increase of about 40 percent incorporates the devaluation as well
as the increase of about 70 percent in the government fuel tax. The transportation sub-index
of the CPI basket would be directly affected.2 The current weight of the transportation subindex is about 12 percent. Previous
350

episodes of increases in the retail of

index (lef t scale)

fuel price increase would translate
250

into a 4.2 percentage increase in

overall inflation. To capture the
second-round effects, we conducted

a vector auto-regression (VAR)
Oil price

(SRD per liter, right scale)
analysis using the retail price for

index, and the total CPI. The results
0

suggest that a 40 percent increase in
fuel prices would lead to an increase
of about 5 percent in the overall CPI
within three months.
Motor vehicle tax
When fully implemented, the reintroduction of the motor vehicle tax is projected to bring in
SRD 240 million in revenue. There are about 115,000 vehicles currently registered in
Suriname. Assuming that 100,000 of them are operational and will be subject to the motor
vehicle tax, the average annual tax per vehicle is estimated at SRD 2,400. We simulate the
inflation impact by comparing it to the effect of the fuel tax increase on the cost of
transportation. Assuming average fuel consumption per car per year of 2,000 liters, the
higher fuel prices will increase the annual costs to car owners by SRD 2,640, or slightly
higher than the effect of the motor vehicle tax, when fully implemented. Thus, we estimate
the impact on inflation of the motor vehicle tax at about 4.5 percent.
Two percentage points increase in sales tax on goods and services
As discussed above, 56.3 percent of the CPI basket will be affected directly by the increase in
the sales tax on goods. The size of the price pass-through will mostly depend on the pricing
power of businesses. If the economy is weak and the market structure is highly competitive,
then businesses may have to absorb more of the tax increases themselves. Assuming a

2

Higher fuel prices will also push up the cost of electricity generation of the state electricity company, but the
electricity tariff is controlled by the government.

26
complete price pass-through, a sales tax increase of 2 percentage points would lead to a
1.1 percent increase in overall inflation.
Services in the CPI basket that are likely be affected include “Recreation, Education, and
Culture” (weight: 4.1 percent); “Restaurants” (1.4 percent); and “Miscellaneous Goods and
Services” (10.7 percent, assuming half is services). Their total weight in the CPI is
11 percent. Assuming a full price pass-through, an increase in the sales tax rate on services
from 8 percent to 10 percent would push up inflation by 0.2 percent.
New sales tax of 12 percent on water, energy, and gas
The sub-index of the CPI basket that would be affected is “Housing and Utilities,” which
accounts for 14.2 percent of the CPI basket. Assuming that water, energy, and gas account
for half of “Housing and Utilities,” a new 12 percent sales tax would boost inflation by
0.9 percent.
Higher sales and excise taxes on alcoholic beverages and tobacco
The weight of alcoholic beverages and tobacco in the CPI basket is 2.9 percent. We assume
the weight is 2 percent excluding beer, for which there is no tax increase. Staff estimates that
a combined increase of the sales and excise taxes, combined with the devaluation would push
up the price of alcoholic beverages and tobacco by about 21 and 44 percent, respectively, and
overall inflation by 0.7 percent.3
Revenue gains versus inflation impacts
The table below summarizes the revenue gains and inflation costs of each revenue measure.
The inflation costs for some of the measures are smaller than reported above because they are
stripped of the devaluation effects (e.g., on higher fuel prices).

APPENDIX II. ILLUSTRATIVE MEDIUM-TERM PROJECTIONS AND
DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSES (DSAS)
Staff conducted fiscal and external sector debt sustainability analyses, based on a plausible
medium-term outlook that was discussed with the authorities.
A. Government Finances
Key assumptions
Revenue (as percentage of GDP) is projected to remain broadly stable over the next
three years, and increase gradually thereafter, as new mining projects come on stream.
Revenue from the state oil company will be higher after the completion of its new refinery.
Revenue collections will be further boosted by the implementation of a VAT regime and the
government’s expected minority participation in new mining sector projects. Grants,
however, will decline substantially, as the Netherlands Treaty Funds run out in 2012.
The fiscal balance is expected to steadily improve as a result of sustained fiscal
consolidation efforts. Public sector wage bill is assumed to grow only moderately over the
medium term, as the growth of the annual nominal wage is capped at about ten percent.
Spending on subsidies and transfers and especially on goods and services will also be
brought under control. The improvement in revenue collections and the contracting of
concessional external financing will support capital expenditure at a sustainable level of
5¼ percent of GDP. The overall fiscal deficit is projected to gradually decline to 1.2 percent
of GDP in 2013. Thereafter, and once higher mineral revenues kick in, the fiscal balance is
expected to improve rapidly and turn positive in 2015. As a result of improvements in
structure of public finances (e.g., higher consumption taxes, lower current spending, etc.) the
non-mineral balance is projected to improve by 4 percentage point of GDP over the medium
term.
The DSA assumes the continuation of prudent management of Suriname’s public debt.
In particular, external debt is assumed to be contracted at favorable terms and in line with the
country’s implementation capacity.
Assessment of the fiscal DSA
Suriname’s public debt distress is low. Public debt is expected to improve moderately over
the medium term, underpinned by robust growth, a stronger fiscal stance, and prudent debt
management. While the debt burden is sensitive to standard shocks, even under various
distress scenarios, the debt-to-GDP ratio is likely to remain relatively low, at just over
20 percent.

28
B. Balance of Payments
Key assumptions
The medium-term outlook is based on the assumption of a broad continuation of present
policies, amid a sizable increase in output beginning in 2014, as major new projects in the
non-renewable resources sector come on line. The main assumptions are the following:


Medium-term potential output is estimated to be near 5 percent. The economy will be
growing above this rate in the medium term as major capital investments are made in
the mineral sector and infrastructure. Once these investments are completed, higher
production in all three sectors—gold, alumina and petroleum—will spur growth rates
above their present level, reflecting an increase in potential output growth.



The authorities will be successful in their efforts to contain current inflationary
pressures, and inflation will converge towards 5 percent over the medium term.



The increase in imports of capital and intermediate inputs related to the large
investment projects will keep the external current account in deficit through 2014 and
remain close to balance for a few years thereafter. However, the country’s reserves
will continue to strengthen, as large FDI-related capital account surpluses more than
offset the current account shortfalls. Accordingly, the reserve coverage will increase
from about 4½ months of imports at end-2010 to 7½ months of imports by the end of
the projection period.

Assessment of the External DSA
The path of the external debt remains relatively flat throughout the projection period, at
8.6 percent of GDP in 2011, peaking at 10.6 percent in 2014 and falling to 9.3 percent by
2016. While the level of external debt will remain very low, its share within total public debt
will increase over time—reaching about 70 percent of total debt by 2016. The external debt
ratio is particularly sensitive to a non-interest current account shock, given the increasing
current account deficit and financing needs associated with the investments in the nonrenewable resource sector. Should the external current account balance be weaker than
assumed, the external debt would reach 42 percent at the end of the projection period. On the
other hand, a real depreciation shock would only raise external debt to 14 percent of GDP by
2014.

1/ Indicate coverage of public sector, e.g., general government or nonfinancial public sector. Also whether net or gross debt is used.
2/ Derived as [(r - (1+g - g + (1+r]/(1+g++g)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate;  = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;  = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and  = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as (1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.

APPENDIX III. ASSESSMENT OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL EXCHANGE RATE
AND CURRENT ACCOUNT
The January 2011 devaluation took place in the context of an overvaluation of the
Surinamese dollar, also reflected in the
155
parallel market. The real effective exchange
Exchange Rates
145 (index: 2003=100)
rate (REER) appreciated markedly in 2008.
Real effective
While the lower inflation in 2009 reversed this 135
exchange rate
appreciation somewhat, the REER rose again

with the pick-up in domestic inflation in 2010.

First, PPP estimates (based on 2008 data)
point to a noticeable overvaluation of the
currency. A comparison with 156 countries
covering all regions and income levels
suggests that the pre-devaluation exchange rate
was 16 percent above its expected. This
represents a worsening of the 10 percent
overvaluation estimated in the last Article IV
consultation that was based on 2007 data.
Second, balance of payment pressures from
growing mineral exports will put pressures
toward appreciation on the Surinamese in
the medium and long term. In light of its
dependence on mineral exports, Suriname may
wish to increase and save its external current
account (CA) surplus in the coming years. In
order to use the present value of mineral
exports to provide a constant real annuity in
perpetuity, Suriname would need to increase
its CA surplus beyond projected levels so as to

Suriname’s lack of sufficiently long data
series precludes an analysis of the
equilibrium exchange rate based on a
single-country model of the real equilibrium
exchange rate. Using CGER’s estimates to
implement the macro balance approach would
be unsuitable, as these are primarily based on a
sample of non-mineral producers. Therefore,
two other methodologies are applied.

build up a large enough stock of NFA. By accumulating the NFA, the authorities would
counter the upward pressure on the currency that would otherwise arise in the foreign
exchange market. This exercise is merely illustrative, and it assumes that the totality of
Suriname’s mineral wealth would be invested abroad. Nonetheless, this analysis suggests that
the recent devaluation was a step in the right direction towards generating the necessary
savings in the form of medium-term current account surpluses, in line with a sustainable
equilibrium exchange rate.

Nonfinancial Relations with the Authorities
Exchange rate arrangements
The national currency is the Surinamese dollar (SRD), which replaced the Surinamese
guilder in January 2004 at a conversion rate of 1,000 guilders per SRD. On January 20, 2011,
the authorities devalued the currency by 20 percent vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar in the official
market. With the devaluation, the authorities set a band of SRD 3.25–3.35 per US dollar,
within which all official and commercial market transactions are allowed to take place. The
de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as “stabilized.” In conjunction with the

3
devaluation, the authorities also did away with an existing multiple currency practice (MCP),
in the form of a special exchange rate for imports of infant formula. Suriname maintains
MCPs arising from the spread of more than 2 percent between the buying and the selling
rates in the official market for government transactions and also from the possible spread of
more than 2 percent between these official rates for government transactions and those in the
commercial markets that can take place within the established band.
Last Article IV consultation
The last Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on February 3, 2010
(IMF Country Report No. 10/44). Suriname is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle.

APPENDIX II. SURINAME––RELATIONS WITH THE INTER-AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of March 31, 2011)

In 1980, Suriname joined the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB), which at present is
its largest multilateral lender. As of March 2011, Suriname’s outstanding debt to the IADB
stood at US$67 million, mostly on Intermediate Fund Financing (IFF) terms.
The IADB and Suriname are currently transitioning between two strategy periods and the
new Country Strategy, covering 2011–2015, is expected to be approved during the third
quarter of this year. The most recent IADB Country Strategy with Suriname 2006–2010 was
approved in 2007 and highlighted three equally important pillars: development of the public
sector; development of the private sector; and integration of the interior. The new strategy
aims to support Suriname in reducing the risk to its macroeconomic outlook by accelerating
economic diversification, expanding economic opportunities, enhancing the effectiveness of
the public sector, augmenting the role of the private sector in the economy, increasing access
to social services, and setting up an adequate framework for ensuring sustainable
management of natural resources. In so doing, the IADB will support interventions in:
(i) agriculture, (ii) education, (iii) energy, (iv) financial sector (v) natural resources
management, (vi) protection and promotion of human capital, (vii) quality of spending and
management of results, and (viii) transportation (and integration). Issues related to natural
disaster risks, climate change, gender and diversity will be addressed in a cross-cutting
manner. The total lending envelope for the period is still being discussed and will include
policy-based lending in additional to the traditional investment instrument.
The active loan portfolio consists of 12 operations, totaling US$143 million, a year-on-year
increase of 1.4 percent as one new operation (in water) was approved for a total amount of
US$12 million. The average age of the loans in the entire portfolio is 3.6 years. However,
when four operations (Basic Education Improvement Project, Health Sector Facility,
Strengthening of Public Sector Management, and Trade Sector Support Program) exit the
portfolio at the end of 2011, the average age will fall considerably. The undisbursed portion
of the loan portfolio in execution (US$77.4 million) is entirely from the Ordinary Capital
lending window (non-concessional) with IFF subsidy.
The TC portfolio for Suriname comprises of 23 operations (US$10.1 million), of which
46.6 percent has been disbursed. The size of the TC portfolio declined by 17.2 percent since
March 31, 2010, on account of the closing of some old operations.

APPENDIX III. SURINAME––RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
(As of March 31, 2011)
The World Bank is now in the process of re-engaging with the Surinamese authorities after a
30 years hiatus. World Bank involvement in Suriname has been limited and the last
significant activity was a proposal for a hydropower plant in 1980. Currently, at the request
of the authorities an Auditing and Accounting Report on the Observance of Standards and
Codes (ROSC) is being conducted. An Interim Strategy Note (ISN), which sets out the World
Bank Group’s support to the government’s reform program, is expected to be completed and
approved by the Board in September 2011. It has been agreed with the government that
initial World Bank support would focus primarily on technical assistance for institutional
strengthening and capacity building for the Government and the Central Bank. Targeted
investment lending for key sectors such as energy, infrastructure and agriculture, would also
be considered.

8
APPENDIX IV. SURINAME––STATISTICAL ISSUES
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provided to the Fund has some shortcomings, but they are broadly adequate
for surveillance purposes. The authorities are making an effort to improve the quality and
dissemination of economic data. In particular, starting in February 2011, key fiscal and
monetary data are being published at the central bank’s external website.
National accounts: Difficulties in data collection and long delays in the provision of source
data affect production-based GDP estimates. The lack of timely, reliable source data on price
indices for tourism services, transportation and communication also adversely affects
production-based GDP estimates. Component weights of sub-indices within the CPI are not
available.
The expenditure breakdown of national accounts is still limited, and there is also no
reconciliation between the national accounts and the balance of payments, which hampers an
accurate evaluation of the savings and investment balance.
CARTAC has conducted two national accounts missions in October 2010 and January
2011. The primary purpose of these missions was to provide technical assistance to revise the
base year of the GDP from 1990 to 2006. This revision process is expected to improve the
coverage and quality of GDP by production. As per the work program, GDP by production
for the revised base year series will be released during the third quarter of 2011.
Government finance statistics: Public finance statistics are limited to those for the central
government. Estimates for revenue and expenditure components often differ among the
Ministry of Finance, the Central Bank of Suriname, and the Central Paymaster data,
increasing the uncertainty about the true fiscal position. The existence of domestic payment
arrears also adds to the uncertainty.
The institutional coverage of fiscal statistics needs to be broadened to the nonfinancial public
sector so as to better assess the fiscal risks associated with total public sector debt. The actual
number of public enterprises remains difficult to determine, and most of these enterprises do
not produce accounts on a timely basis. Available public debt statistics cover only debt
contracted or guaranteed by the central government.
Monetary and financial statistics: More recently, the timeliness of monetary and financial
statistics has been improved to two weeks for the central bank accounts and two months for
the accounts of other depository corporations. The quality of monetary and financial statistics
continues to improve, and the reporting to the IMF’s Statistics department is regular. The
central bank is working with an external consultant to further improve monetary and
financial statistics and has started to publish regularly monetary and financial data on its

9
external website.
External sector: There still remain significant shortcomings in the area of balance of
payments statistics, such as weak data collection, under-coverage, misclassification, and
deviations from the balance of payments manuals. While trade data are relatively reliable,
data on services and private capital inflows are incomplete and suffer from poor compilation
systems. Estimates of the components of the financial account (especially private external
debt) also need to be improved.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Suriname participates in the GDDS.
No data ROSC is available.
III. Reporting to STA
Suriname currently does not report fiscal statistics for inclusion in either International
Financial Statistics, or the Government Financial Statistics Yearbook.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation
with Suriname
On May 2, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Suriname.1
Background
In 2010, economic growth is estimated to have picked up to 4.4 percent, from 3 percent
in 2009, owing to buoyant activity in the mineral sector. Inflation rose from 1.3 percent at
end-2009 to 10.3 percent at end-2010, following large wage increases in the civil service
and higher food and fuel prices. In January 2011, the authorities devalued the
Surinamese dollar by 20 percent in the official market, bringing it broadly in line with the
rate in the parallel market. At the same time, they raised fuel taxes by about 40 percent
and introduced additional measures of fiscal consolidation. In the wake of these
adjustments, 12-month inflation rose to 18.6 percent in February 2011. The external
current account balance is estimated to have improved from a deficit of 1 percent of
GDP in 2009 to a surplus of about 1 percent of GDP in 2010, in the context of strong
mineral exports. Gross international reserves rose by US$22 million in 2010, to
US$785 million at year-end (4.4 months of imports).
The overall fiscal deficit shifted from a surplus of 2.2 percent of GDP during 2007-08 to
a deficit of 3.3 percent of GDP during 2009-10. Lower tax revenues were only offset in
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return
to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive
Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board,
summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's
authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

part by higher nontax revenue from the state-owned oil company and grant
disbursements. However, both current and capital expenditures rose significantly,
reflecting elevated spending prior to the elections, including on goods and services and
in connection with the civil service wage reforms. In 2009 and the first half of 2010, the
deficit was financed in part by a build-up of domestic payment arrears (estimated at
about 1 percent of GDP at end-2010). Public debt rose from 18 percent of GDP in 2008
to 21.6 percent in 2010.
Growth of broad money (M2), which had surged in late-2009 and early-2010, declined in
the second half of 2010. Year-on-year private sector credit growth also eased, to around
10 percent, at end-2010, continuing a trend started in mid-2008. Dollarization ratios in
the banking sector have continued to decline. The banking sector as a whole appears to
be generally well capitalized, but compliance with regulatory norms varies across the
sector. In 2010, CLICO-Suriname was acquired by a local insurance company.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted Suriname’s favorable economic outlook, supported by
buoyant commodity prices and strong private and public investments in the mineral and
energy sectors and infrastructure. These investments should help raise the growth
potential, strengthen government revenue, and improve the external position. Directors
considered that the main challenge in the near term is to contain rising inflationary
pressures, while further efforts should be pursued to ensure fiscal sustainability over the
medium term.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to tighten fiscal policy and improve
public finances. They stressed the need to rein in current expenditure and avoid the
development of a wage-price inflation spiral, and strengthen social support programs to
target the most vulnerable households affected by the rise in inflation.
Directors noted that, with the expected substantial decline in foreign grants in coming
years, it is important to strengthen government revenue to ensure fiscal sustainability. In
this regard, they welcomed the recent revenue-enhancing measures and encouraged
the authorities to press forward with the introduction of a VAT system and other
measures under consideration. Directors concurred that a credible medium-term fiscal
framework and an improved capacity for managing public finances will be crucial to
ensuring fiscal sustainability over the medium term. They also urged the authorities to
take decisive actions to reform and strengthen the financial positions of public utility
companies.
Directors encouraged the authorities to remain vigilant toward inflationary pressures and
stand ready to tighten monetary policy as needed. They noted the staff’s assessment
that the new official exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals, and supported
the authorities’ plans to review the exchange rate arrangement and consider greater
exchange rate flexibility over time. Directors also welcomed Fund technical assistance to

3
develop indirect monetary instruments and strengthen the central bank’s capacity to
conduct open market operations.
Directors supported the authorities’ efforts to strengthen supervision of the banking and
insurance sectors. They considered that an early FSAP exercise would be useful to
assess the strengths and weaknesses in the banking sector. They also welcomed the
authorities’ commitment to promote a gradual dedollarization of the banking system.
Directors encouraged further progress in improving the business environment to
facilitate the development of a dynamic private sector and help diversify the economy. In
this context, they noted the authorities’ intention to increase the public share in the
exploitation of natural resources and encouraged a national dialogue to help foster
consensus on such investments and the management of the expected rise in mineral
revenues.
Directors commended the authorities for their efforts to improve the quality and
dissemination of economic data, including in the balance of payments.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Paulo Nogueira Batista, Jr., Executive Director for Suriname
and Eduardo Saboia, Advisor to the Executive Director
May 2, 2011

On behalf of the Surinamese authorities, we thank the mission chief and his team for
very constructive meetings in preparation for this year’s Article IV Consultation. The
authorities appreciated the staff report and welcomed many of its recommendations. We also
thank Management for the technical assistance that is being provided to Suriname in several
areas and emphasize its critical role in fostering capacity building in the public sector.
Suriname, a former Dutch colony in South America, has a multiethnic population that
is culturally linked to different parts of the world. The new administration, in office since
August 2010, has expressed a strong interest in better integrating Suriname to its neighboring
countries and in taking advantage of new opportunities arising in dynamic emerging market
and developing countries. In a meeting in Paramaribo, in September 2010, President
Bouterse stressed in conversation with us that he had entrusted economic policy to
professionals (Governor Hoefdraad and Minister Boedhoe) who had been chosen on the basis
of their technical expertise. The governor of the Central Bank is an experienced former IMF
staff member.
Outlook
Suriname, with a population of just over half a million people, is blessed with varied
natural resources and has experienced high growth rates over the last years. The country has
benefited, more than its regional peers, from the ongoing commodity boom, particularly by
the rebound in prices of gold, petroleum, and alumina, which are its top export products.
In the medium term, Suriname’s growth potential could rise to a much higher level
that the current one. Real GDP rose by 4.5 percent in 2010, up from 3 percent in 2009. The
authorities project a 5 percent growth for 2011, and the outlook for the following years is
even more favorable as large private and public investments in the mineral and energy
sectors mature, pushing up the country’s growth potential.
Suriname faces challenges that are typical of commodity-dependent countries.
Increased revenues during periods of commodity price booms have been squandered by
inadequate public financial management and the absence of the right checks and balances in
the system. The Surinamese authorities are well aware of the need to avoid a repetition of
this experience.

2
Fiscal policy
The new administration inherited a difficult fiscal situation. During 2007–2008,
Suriname had benefited from an overall fiscal surplus of 2.2 percent of GDP on average, but
this surplus eroded into deficit of 3.3 percent on average in the following two years. Current
and capital expenditures increased in the run-up to the May 2010 elections. A shortfall in tax
collections from the bauxite/alumina sector also played a part in the shift to a deficit, as
mentioned in the staff report. Higher expenditure was partly financed by a build-up of
domestic payments arrears (1 percent of GDP), a practice that the new administration wishes
to avoid.
The new administration has had to honor the public sector wage increases approved
under the previous government. Half of the agreed increment under the second phase of the
civil wage reform (FISO-2) was implemented in July 2010, shortly before the new
government took office. The other half was made effective January 2011, already under the
new administration.
During the meetings with staff, the authorities described several of the measures
adopted to compensate for the impact of these wage increases on the budget. On the revenue
side, fuel taxes have already been adjusted, to be followed by higher taxes on alcohol and
tobacco, an increase in the presumptive tax on casinos, a reactivation of the motor vehicle
tax, a widening of the sales tax base and an increase in its rate. Also the authorities have
launched a comprehensive project to register informal gold sector operators and bring them
into the tax fold through a presumptive tax system.
The staff argues that current spending, especially in goods and services, needs to be
contained. The authorities agree, but they also note that part of the current spending is related
to a backlog of domestic payment arrears accumulated in late 2009 and early 2010 that they
are starting to clear. Both sides agree that bringing the overall deficit to about 2 percent of
GDP in 2011 would be a desirable objective.
Monetary, exchange rate, and financial sector policies
The authorities are alert to short-term inflationary pressures, as described in the staff
report. They maintain the view that the high inflation in early 2011 reflected primarily the
pass-through effect of higher fuel taxes and international oil prices to the domestic market.
The fact that the value of the currency in both the official and parallel markets has stabilized
since end-January and that the increase in food prices remained relatively small is seen by the
authorities as an indication that inflationary pressures are so far under control. The authorities
are confident that inflation will gradually decline in 2011. However, as stated in the report,
the central bank indicated that, if needed, it would be ready to tighten monetary policy.

3
The Central Bank of Suriname is keen to develop indirect instruments of monetary
policy. They have requested technical assistance from the Fund and from the central banks of
Brazil and Colombia in several areas, including liquidity forecasting and the conduct of open
market operations.
The decision to devalue the currency by 20 percent against the U.S. dollar brought the
official exchange rate in line with the parallel market. The authorities intend to monitor
developments closely over the next year or so, while considering further reforms in the
exchange rate regime.
The report recognizes that banks are generally well capitalized and profitable. But
compliance with prudential norms remains uneven and nonperforming loan ratios high. There
is agreement between the authorities and staff on the need to strengthen supervision of the
financial sector. There is also convergence on the need to gradually de-dollarize the
Surinamese economy. As an input to assess the situation and find solutions, the authorities
are very interested in holding a Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) exercise as
soon as possible. The FSAP was scheduled only for mid-2012, because of personnel
restrictions on the part of the Fund. Our chair believes that greater priority should be given to
countries, even small ones that demonstrate an interest in undergoing FSAPs.
Structural issues
The new administration is stepping up investment in infrastructure, to improve
transport communication and housing for the Surinamese people. The authorities plan to
dedicate more resources towards social welfare, in order to reduce inequalities and eliminate
poverty. They are committed to strengthening the well-being and the physical and intellectual
capacity of the population by heavily investing in health and education.
In the view of the authorities, a strong private sector, respecting the rules as set out by
government, should be the backbone of the Surinamese economy. They are working towards
improving the business environment, including through speeding up company registration
and licensing processes12.
The Surinamese government is fully aware of the fact that for too long the economy
has been relying on the windfalls of high commodity prices for just a limited group of
products. Decade after decade Suriname, like other developing countries, has been riding the
roller coaster from boom to bust. To overcome this vicious cycle, the authorities attach
12

In a footnote to page 13 of the report, staff mentions that Suriname remains in the lower range of the World
Bank’s Doing Business Index. We caution, however, against attaching importance to this classification of
countries which is based on a highly questionable methodology.

strategic importance to diversifying the economy. The government’s focus is on expanding
agricultural production and exports (particularly rice, fruits, and vegetables) and learning
from successful experiences of other developing countries.
The new administration believes that this is the time to improve national institutions
and build capacity to guarantee the proper functioning of the economy, based on sound
macroeconomic fundamentals. The staff’s recommendations on the need to improve the
management of key public utility companies are in line with the authorities’ awareness of the
need to enhance the efficiency of the public sector.
To assist it in its path towards these objectives, Suriname has the intention to increase
foreign borrowing from multilateral agencies, notably the IADB and the World Bank.
Engaging with these institutions, with which Suriname has had a very small portfolio, is seen
by the authorities as a means of ensuring that the national development process is credible
and carefully thought out. In the view of the authorities, incoming FDI and foreign borrowing
should be guided towards those projects which will improve Suriname’s real economy and
create employment, while preserving the environment.
