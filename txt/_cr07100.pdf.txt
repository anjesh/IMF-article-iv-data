EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Focus of the report
The discussions for the 2006 Article IV consultation focused on the macroeconomic and
structural policy adjustments that would be necessary to achieve and sustain higher growth
rates while reducing inflation, which remains entrenched in the double digits.
Background
With high oil prices and a significant policy stimulus, real GDP growth is estimated at
5½ percent in 2005/06 (the fiscal year starts on March 21), and is projected at near 6 percent
in 2006/07. End-of-period inflation declined to below 7 percent in April 2006, but increased
in recent months, reaching 14.7 percent in November. The rial appreciated by over
11 percent in real effective terms from March 2005 to September 2006. The fiscal stance has
been highly expansionary. Although the overall fiscal position (commitment basis) is
projected to be roughly in balance, the non-oil fiscal deficit is expected to increase to
21 percent of GDP in 2006/07, from 15 percent in 2004/05. Broad money and private sector
credit have continued to grow at a strong pace. In March 2006, the authorities lowered the
rate of return (interest rate) on state banks’ lending and set the rate on private banks’ lending,
which was previously freely determined. The external current account and the international
reserves position have strengthened owing to the sharp increase in oil exports.
Views of the authorities
The authorities indicated that their main objective was to use the additional oil revenue to
sustain growth and job creation, with emphasis on addressing social needs. They said that
they would slow the pace of government spending if inflationary pressures were to persist.
The government intends to seek parliament’s approval for a value-added tax (VAT) by
mid-2007/08. The transportation system will be upgraded as a precondition for reforming
energy subsidies. The central bank intends to tighten monetary policy by intensifying open
market operations, and the rial will continue to depreciate at a slower pace to contain
inflation. On the structural front, the authorities have decided to reinvigorate the privatization
program.
Staff recommendations
The staff encouraged the authorities to implement a strong fiscal adjustment supported by a
tighter monetary policy and greater exchange rate flexibility to ease demand pressures and
put inflation on a downward path. It also stressed the importance of addressing the numerous
distortions stemming from the extensive controls on prices and rates of return, and of phasing
out energy subsidies, which are very large. The staff emphasized that, to be successful, the
privatization program needed to be accompanied by reforms aimed at ensuring a
level-playing field for the private sector and improving investor confidence.

6
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
The main challenge faced by Iran is the need to attain and sustain higher rates of
growth to provide employment for its fast growing labor force while lowering inflation.
Every year approximately 750,000 Iranians enter the labor market for the first time, putting
enormous pressure on the ability of the economy to create jobs. Attempts to support
economic activity and job creation through fiscal and monetary stimuli have resulted in
persistent double-digit inflation, which undermines the objective of achieving high
sustainable growth rates over the medium term. Against this background, the consultation
discussions focused on:
•

The adjustments in fiscal, monetary, and exchange rate policies that are necessary to
achieve a significant reduction in inflation.

•

The need to address the distortions caused by extensive administrative controls on
prices and rates of return (interest rates), as well as large subsidies, particularly those
on energy products.

•

The authorities’ structural reform plans, including their decision to reinvigorate the
privatization program.

Fund surveillance in recent years has focused on the macroeconomic imbalances associated
with an expansionary policy stance and structural obstacles to growth and job
creation (Box 1).
Box 1. Effectiveness of IMF Surveillance
Fund advice has concentrated on the need to reduce the non-oil fiscal deficit and enhance fiscal
transparency, improve the effectiveness of monetary policy, and accelerate structural reforms.
On the fiscal side, the authorities have made progress in strengthening the tax administration and improving
transparency, and have established the Oil Stabilization Fund (OSF) to address oil price volatility. However,
containing current expenditures and phasing out subsidies has proven difficult, as the authorities continue to
face strong political pressure to increase spending in order to promote growth and reduce unemployment.
In the monetary and exchange rate areas, the Fund has called for increasing central bank independence,
eliminating administrative controls, and allowing for greater exchange rate flexibility. Although discussions
to strengthen the role of the central bank are under way, the effectiveness of monetary instruments remains
weak and progress in increasing exchange rate flexibility has been limited.
On the structural front, several important reforms were implemented during 2000/01–2002/03, including
exchange rate unification, trade liberalization, tax reform, and the adoption of a new foreign direct
investment (FDI) law. Significant changes have also been introduced in the financial sector through the
adoption of a number of the 2000 Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) recommendations. Progress
has been slow, however, in the areas of privatization and subsidy reform.

7
II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
2.
The government’s economic priorities have been reassessed after the change of
administration. Structural reforms introduced during 2000/01–2002/03 fostered the
integration of Iran in the global economy. Since the administration of
President Ahmadi Nejad took office in 2005, the focus of economic policies has shifted
toward reducing social and regional disparities. This new approach has entailed using much
of the additional revenue from high oil prices to finance higher government spending.
3.
The economy experienced robust growth in 2005/06, but unemployment
remained high. Real GDP growth is estimated at 5.4 percent in 2005/06, boosted by high oil
prices, a weather-related recovery in agriculture, and strong fiscal and monetary stimuli
(Figure 1a and Table 1). Oil GDP growth was modest owing to capacity constraints, while
non-oil GDP growth was broad-based, reaching 6 percent. The tensions associated with the
nuclear issue, however, had some adverse effects on private investment, particularly FDI.
The unemployment rate increased to 11.5 percent in 2005/06 (Figure 1b), before declining to
10.2 percent in the first half of 2006/07.

The fiscal stance in 2005/06 was highly expansionary. The original 2005/06 budget
sought to reduce the non-oil fiscal deficit by raising revenue and keeping government

8
expenditures constant relative to GDP. However, two supplementary budgets passed by
parliament contained additional appropriations to cover higher gasoline imports and food
subsidies, bring teachers’ salaries in line with those of other civil servants, and improve rural
infrastructure. As a result, despite the large increase in oil revenue, the consolidated surplus
of the central government and the OSF (commitment basis) declined from 1.7 percent of
GDP in 2004/05 to 1.1 percent in 2005/06, with the non-oil deficit widening from
15.2 percent of GDP to more than 20 percent over the same period (Figures 3a and 3b).

6.
The fiscal expansion is projected to continue in 2006/07. Notwithstanding a
projected increase in non-oil revenues associated with a strong performance of direct taxes, a
further increase in both current and capital outlays would result in a roughly balanced overall
fiscal position (commitment basis) in 2006/07, with the non-oil deficit rising further to
21 percent of GDP (Text Table 1 and Tables 2 and 3).1 Substantial resources were withdrawn
from the OSF during 2005/06–2006/07 to finance government spending as well as net
lending to the private sector (Table 4).2 As a result, reserves in the OSF rose by only

The original budget for 2006/07 was modified in October 2006 to cover the rising cost of gasoline imports,
and a bill before parliament envisages a further increase in the budget appropriations for wages and salaries and
the execution of investment projects.

The OSF can lend up to 50 percent of its balance in foreign currency to the private sector via the domestic
banking system.

US$1.2 billion in 2005/06, reaching US$10.7 billion at the end of that fiscal year. OSF
reserves are expected to increase further to US$12.4 billion by end-2006/07.
7.
A large portion of the additional expenditures committed in the last budget
amendment for 2005/06 was shifted to 2006/07, which is expected to increase the
pressures on monetary policy. Due to this deferred spending, the fiscal outturn on a cash
basis for 2005/06 was considerably better than that on a commitment basis. As these
resources are spent, a considerable injection of liquidity is expected to take place this fiscal
year.
8.
Monetary policy remains constrained by fiscal dominance and limitations on the
effective use of the available monetary instruments. The large spending out of oil
revenues has continued to challenge the ability of the Central Bank of Iran (CBI) to meet its
monetary targets. Broad money increased at an annual rate of about 35 percent in 2005/06
and the first half of 2006/07, with base money growing even more rapidly (Tables 5 and 6).
Credit to the private sector has continued to grow at a strong pace. The CBI’s efforts to mop
up liquidity by placing central bank participation papers (CBPPs) have been hampered by the
need to obtain parliamentary approval for new issues. Moreover, monetary conditions were
eased in March 2006 by lowering the rate of return for state-owned banks’ lending from 16 to
14 percent and setting the rate of return for private banks’ lending, which was previously
freely determined, at 17 percent.3 In addition, in April 2006 parliament approved legislation
3

The rates of return on deposits were kept broadly unchanged, ranging from 7 percent (short term) to
16 percent (five year). The rate of return on CBPPs had been reduced from 17 to 15½ percent in May 2005; it
has been kept unchanged since then.

that commits the government and the CBI to reduce the rate of return on bank facilities to
single digits by the end of the Fourth Five-Year Development Plan (FFYDP), in 2009/10.

weakened against the euro. Owing to the inflation differential with its trading partners, Iran’s
real effective exchange rate appreciated by over 11 percent from March 2005 to
September 2006 (Figure 4).

Reflecting the sharp increase in oil prices, external indicators continued to
improve in 2005/06. The external

import growth slowed following a
substantial increase in the two previous years (Text Table 2).4 The strong export performance
continued in the first half of 2006/07, with import growth accelerating to over 20 percent.

Although petrochemicals, in particular, have benefited from highly subsidized inputs, most other non-oil
exports have also performed strongly in recent years.

Gross international reserves, including those in the OSF, rose to US$55.6 billion at
end-September 2006 (nine months of imports of goods and nonfactor services), and the
external debt declined to about 11 percent of GDP (Table 8).

12.
Structural reforms slowed during the initial months of the current
administration, but the government recently decided to provide new impetus to the
privatization program. Following the amendment of Article 44 of the constitution, in
July 2006 Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Khamenei issued an executive order to privatize
80 percent of the state-owned companies over the next 10 years (excluding the upstream oil
sector, crucial infrastructure, and some banks). The program has a strong social orientation,
as part of the shares of a significant number of enterprises will be allocated to the poorer
segments of the population (Box 2).
13.
Under a new Capital Markets Law, the authorities have established a Security and
Exchange Commission, and regulations are being developed on investment banking, mutual
funds, and supervision of investment companies.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
14.
During the discussions, the authorities indicated that their policies and reform
strategy continue to be guided by the main directives contained in the FFYDP, adjusted
in light of the higher oil revenues. Specifically, the authorities stated that their main policy
priority was to use the additional oil revenue to sustain growth and job creation, with
particular emphasis on the expansion of the activities of small- and medium-size enterprises,
the reduction of economic disparities among regions, and the social needs of the population.
The authorities also noted that special attention will be given to the completion of a large
number of investment projects.

12

Box 2. Public Enterprises and Privatization
Iran’s economy is state dominated. A large number of state enterprises and quasi-state institutions (bonyads)
are engaged in economic activities in virtually all sectors. Purely private firms are currently found mostly in
agriculture, domestic and foreign trade, small-scale manufacturing, and mining. The private sector’s role in
large-scale economic activity remains negligible.
An initial effort toward privatization began in the late 1980s—largely through stock market offerings. A
second wave of reform in the late 1990s sought to create a more attractive investment environment and
included a new privatization program. However, complicated regulatory and legal structures and weak
political support prevented an effective implementation of this program. The executive order issued in
July 2006 has given new impetus to privatization. Excluded from privatization are the upstream oil sector,
crucial infrastructure, some banks, and a few entities in the insurance, utilities, and transport sectors.
The current privatization program has a strong regional and social orientation. Priority access to subsidized
financial support will be accorded to less developed and deprived regions, which will receive some
30 percent of total privatization proceeds. In the case of a significant number of small profitable enterprises,
some 40 to 100 percent of the shares will be allocated to the poorest segments of the population (justice
shares). The shares will be sold to holding companies or mutual funds, on behalf of the poor, at a 50 percent
discounted price and with a 10-year repayment period. The government will retain 20 percent of the shares
in the enterprises, and the remainder will be offered on the TSE. Foreign investors will be permitted to
participate within a 10 percent limit, with approval of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Finance. A
number of other companies will be offered fully at the TSE.
About 19 enterprises have already been identified for privatization. Of these, 15 small-sized firms have been
fully given away as justice shares, and four large firms have had 40 percent of their shares distributed as
justice shares; another 40 percent will be offered to the private sector at the TSE.
The program envisages an annual privatization rate of 20 percent of state-owned companies, beginning with
small-sized firms. State-owned banks will be privatized in the next 2 to 3 years, and the program as a whole
should be completed by the end of the Fifth Five-Year Development Plan, in 2014/15.

15.
With energy prices projected to remain high and external demand continuing to
support non-oil exports, Iran’s near-term growth prospects look favorable. Real GDP
growth is projected at 5.8 percent in 2006/07 on account of continued strong activity in the
non-oil sector. Though the external current account surplus would decline owing to the fiscal
expansion, the international reserves position is expected to strengthen further. The
continuation of the current macroeconomic policies, however, poses a serious risk of a
further intensification of inflationary pressures, with detrimental effects on Iran’s
medium-term growth and employment prospects.5
16.
The staff encouraged the authorities to address these risks through a significant
fiscal adjustment supported by a tighter monetary policy and greater exchange rate
flexibility, along with structural reforms. Discussions also focused on the importance of
addressing the numerous distortions stemming from the extensive regulations and controls on
5

Other risks include a sharp decline in oil prices in the event of a slowdown in global growth, and a further
escalation of the political tensions associated with Iran’s nuclear program, which would affect adversely
investment and growth.

13
prices and rates of return, as well as the credit targets for specific sectors, and of phasing out
subsidies, in particular those on domestic fuels, to increase economic efficiency and contain
environmental degradation.
17.
The authorities noted that while they attached the highest priority to promoting
growth and job creation, they were also concerned about inflation and intended to lower
it gradually to single-digit levels. They underscored that they would take steps to slow the
pace of government spending if inflationary pressures were to persist.
A. Fiscal Policy
18.
The authorities indicated that, as a medium-term objective, the government
intended to fully cover recurrent expenditures with non-oil revenues. To move in that
direction, the government would seek parliament’s approval for the introduction of a VAT by
mid-2007/08. Steps would also be taken to strengthen tax administration, particularly
controls over large taxpayers, and to gradually reduce subsidies on several consumer items
(e.g., sugar and fertilizers) (Box 3). Owing to the increase in the cost of external borrowing
faced by Iran, the authorities intend to resort to further use of OSF resources, along with
foreign financing.6
19.
The staff encouraged the authorities to take additional fiscal measures
equivalent to 2 percentage points of GDP on an annual basis, starting in the last quarter
of 2006/07, to reduce demand pressures and prevent a large further real appreciation.
This would require adopting a policy of expenditure restraint during the remainder of
2006/07 and intensifying the fiscal effort in 2007/08 by advancing the overdue reform of
energy subsidies. The staff argued that the early adoption of a plan to phase out these
subsidies would not only contribute to improving the overall fiscal position, but would also
provide room for social spending and poverty reduction, including additional resources to
compensate the poor for the impact of energy price hikes.
20.
The authorities indicated that efforts will be intensified to upgrade the
transportation system as a precondition for phasing out energy subsidies. The metro and
bus networks would be expanded, and the use of natural gas encouraged in order to reduce
gasoline consumption. The restructuring and upgrading of the system is expected to take
three years. Once this process is under way, the government will consider a gradual
adjustment of domestic fuel prices. The government also intends to expand domestic refining
capacity, which would require substantial new investments.
21.
The staff prepared a baseline medium-term fiscal scenario based on current
policies and WEO oil prices of early December 2006, including the introduction of the
6

In April 2006, Iran’s sovereign debt was downgraded by Fitch from BB- to B+ due to the perceived increase
in country risk.

14
Box 3. Iran’s Subsidy System
Iran’s social safety net reaches a significant portion of the poor, including through direct cash transfers,
housing, and health and social security coverage. The country also maintains extensive subsidies, including
on energy, food, and bank credit. Implicit and explicit energy subsidies alone reached 17½ percent of GDP
in 2005/06, while total subsidies are estimated at over 25 percent of GDP.
Energy Subsidies
Because of energy subsidies, Iran’s fuel product prices are among the lowest in the world, with gasoline
priced at about 9 U.S. cents per liter. The low prices have led to a rapid growth in domestic consumption,
which has averaged 10 percent a year over the past five years, with adverse environmental implications. As
energy prices are well below those of most neighboring countries, the subsidy system has encouraged
smuggling of fuel products. Although Iran is the fourth largest oil producer in the world, the strong growth
in domestic consumption and a slow expansion of refining capacity have led to a surge in gasoline imports.
Nonenergy Subsidies
Price controls on over 20 goods are currently in place. Administered prices are set by the Consumer and
Producer Protection Organization (CPPO) in collaboration with parliament and the country’s economic
council. The most important subsidized goods include cereals (50 percent of all subsidies); basic
commodities such as sugar, edible oils and baby milk (25 percent); and other goods such as paper,
agricultural machinery, fertilizers and pharmaceuticals (25 percent). The CPPO sets consumer prices below
both border prices and producer prices, and the difference is borne by the budget. Explicit nonenergy
subsidies amounted to US$5.5 billion (about 3 percent of GDP) in 2005/06, and are expected to reach
US$6.1 billion in 2006/07.
Subsidy Reform
Phasing out energy subsidies has been on the government’s reform agenda since the inception of the
Third Five-Year Development Plan (1999/00–2003/04). However, little progress has been made to date.
Since 2005, the government has been working on a four-pronged strategy to phase out these subsidies
involving the introduction of a nationwide rationing scheme, a major upgrading of public transportation,
the conversion of vehicle engines from gasoline to natural gas, and a phased increase in domestic fuel
prices. The first phase of this strategy was expected to start at the beginning of 2006/07, but there have
been delays in deploying the rationing scheme.
The government intends to reduce other subsidies (including those on wheat, sugar, agricultural machinery,
and fertilizers) gradually, by replacing them with cash transfers.

VAT starting in 2008/09, as envisaged by the authorities. The scenario suggests that the
projected non-oil primary fiscal deficit, including the implicit subsidies on fuels, would
remain broadly in line with the sustainable path over the medium term if the long-term real
oil price for the WEO reference basket were to be US$65 per barrel (similar to the WEO
price for 2006/07). If the long-term real WEO oil price were US$55 per barrel, however, the
projected non-oil primary deficits would be above the sustainable path (Text Table 3).
B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
22.
To help reduce inflation, the fiscal effort needs to be accompanied by a tighter
monetary stance. The authorities concurred on the need to intensify open market operations
to absorb part of the excess liquidity associated with the use of oil revenue. To that end,
during the remainder of 2006/07 the CBI intends to place CBPPs in an amount of
Rls 30 trillion (1½ percent of GDP), of which Rls 20 trillion has already been approved by

2/ Consistent with WEO projections for international oil prices until 2011/12, as of early December 2006. For
2012/13 onwards, energy prices are consistent with a constant price of US$65 per barrel (at 2006/07 constant
dollars) for the WEO oil reference basket, adjusted for the composition of the Iranian basket.

parliament. The authorities were of the view that the current rate of return on
CBPPs (15½ percent) should be sufficiently attractive to domestic investors. They also noted
that progress had been made in drafting a new Money and Banking Law providing more
independence to the Money and Credit Council, and that a separate draft law would be
presented to parliament empowering the CBI to place CBPPs as needed for purposes of
managing liquidity.
23.
Preliminary monetary projections prepared by the staff show that it would be
difficult to reduce broad money growth below 30 percent by the end of 2006/07, even if the
authorities are successful in placing the envisaged amount of CBPPs. As a result, inflation is
unlikely to decline. The authorities were more optimistic than the staff regarding the ongoing
process of remonetization and the future path of inflation.7
24.
The authorities viewed the current level of the real exchange rate as favorable to
the tradable goods sector. They noted that growth of non-oil exports remained very strong,
notwithstanding the recent real appreciation of the currency. They also indicated that
exchange rate policy would continue to be geared at containing inflation through a slower
nominal depreciation of the rial against a basket of currencies composed mainly of the euro,
7

The authorities were of the view that the behavior of inflation, which has not been in line with the strong
growth of M2, pointed to a structural change in the relationship between these two variables. However, a
forthcoming working paper prepared by the staff that was discussed with the authorities shows that money
(M1) continues to play a dominant role in inflation in Iran, both in the long and short run.

16
the yen, and the U.S. dollar. The authorities did not favor greater exchange rate flexibility
because of its potential adverse implications on the stability of the foreign exchange market.8
25.
Iran maintains an exchange restriction arising from limitations on the
transferability of rial profits from certain foreign investments set out in the by-laws of
the Foreign Investment Promotion and Protection Act (FIPPA). The Fund has approved
the retention of this restriction through March 10, 2007. Recently, Iran’s Ministry of
Economic Affairs and Finance, which is responsible for implementing the FIPPA, has raised
some questions about the effects of the relevant regulations. Staff are currently seeking to
clarify this issue with the authorities.
C. The Financial Sector
26.
Iran’s financial system remains dominated by large state-owned banks and
extensive regulations, including controls on rates of return, subsidized credit for
specific regions, and a credit target for the agricultural and water sectors.9 The scope for
competition is limited and most banks lack commercial autonomy.10 The staff called for a
gradual elimination of distortionary regulations and controls, which in addition to being
cumbersome, do not favor an efficient intermediation of financial savings and encourage the
development of circumventing mechanisms.
27.
Financial soundness indicators weakened somewhat in 2005/06. Bank profitability
declined, reflecting the narrower rate of return margins, and the ratio of nonperforming loans
to total loans increased to 9.9 percent, from 7.7 percent in 2004/05 (the authorities attributed
this increase to continued improvements in accounting and data compilation). The average
risk weighted capital/assets ratio remained almost unchanged at 9.8 percent, above the
8

The three methodologies developed by the Consultative Group on Exchange Rate Issues (CGER) show no
evidence of a serious misalignment of the rial. The macroeconomic balance approach shows that in recent years
Iran’s current account balance has oscillated around its long-term norm. Similarly, a regression-based estimate
of the equilibrium exchange rate shows no evidence of misalignment, though it suggests that the rial may be
somewhat undervalued. The external sustainability approach shows that a lower-than-projected current account
surplus would be needed in 2006/07 to keep net foreign assets constant, also indicating that there may be some
scope for a real appreciation of the rial.

9

The state-owned banks (which hold 90 percent of deposits) comprise six commercial banks, four specialized
banks, and one postal bank. Since 2001, six private banks have been licensed. All banks operate under Islamic
law principles. Following the adoption of the FFYDP, all sectoral credit targets were eliminated, except for a
target of 25 percent of total credit for the agricultural and water sectors. Bank data show that credit to
agriculture was 18 percent of total credit in 2005/06. A credit target of 35 percent has also been introduced for
small- and medium-sized enterprises at subsidized rates, with the subsidy being covered by the budget.

10

The narrower margin on rates of return has encouraged banks to increase to 35 percent of total lending the
share of profit-sharing agreements (i.e., contracts where the rates of return are determined ex-post and are not
subject to controls). In these arrangements, market risks are borne proportionally to each party’s participation in
the project.

17
regulatory minimum. Two new private banks were licensed in 2005/06, raising the
participation of private banks to 10½ percent of total deposits by year’s end.11
28.
Reforms to strengthen bank supervision have continued, but substantial
additional work is needed in this area. Steps have been taken to move from
compliance-based to risk-based prudential supervision, strengthen the banks’ internal control
mechanisms, and update information technology. In addition, the authorities are working on
bringing more financial institutions under the supervision of the CBI. Looking forward, there
is a need to revise the legal framework in order to provide for CBI autonomy, accountability,
and effectiveness in supervisory matters; refine several prudential regulations; fully integrate
on-site inspection with off-site work; and strengthen regulation enforcement.12
29.
The staff discussed with the authorities the impact of the recent decision by the
U.S. Treasury to cut off Bank Saderat Iran (the second largest state-owned commercial
bank) from direct and indirect access to the U.S. financial system. The U.S. claims that
its decision was adopted on the grounds that Bank Saderat had been involved in the financing
of terrorist groups. The authorities stressed that two external audits of the activities of
Bank Saderat conducted in Lebanon and London had found no evidence of any transaction
involving terrorist groups. They also indicated that as a result of the U.S. decision,
Bank Saderat was currently unable to issue letters of credit denominated in U.S. dollars and
was experiencing slower deposit growth. In addition, several correspondent banks in Europe
and Asia with activities in the U.S. were cutting off the bank from operating in other
currencies. The authorities have sent a note requesting Fund management to ascertain
whether the measure adopted by the U.S. Treasury constitutes an exchange restriction subject
to Fund approval. More recently, the U.S. authorities also cut off Bank Sepah (Iran’s fifth
largest state-owned bank) from conducting any business linked to the U.S. financial system.
The U.S. authorities claim that through its role as a financial conduit, Bank Sepah has
facilitated purchases of sensitive material for Iran’s missile program.
D. Structural Reforms
30.
Discussions on structural issues focused on the authorities’ ambitious
privatization program and on trade issues. To a large extent, the success of the
privatization effort depends on an effective transfer of majority control to the private sector,
which could bring better technologies and management practices to the privatized companies.
Moreover, the privatization program needs to be accompanied by an appropriate regulatory
11

However, new applications by private banks are expected to decline in the future in response to a substantial
recent increase in the minimum capital requirement.

12

An MCM mission visited Tehran in December 2006 to provide technical assistance on bank supervision, and
the World Bank is expected to support the process of bank restructuring and privatization. In addition, an FSAP
update is tentatively planned for 2007.

18
framework and by reforms aimed at streamlining the administrative burden, ensuring a
level-playing field for private sector activities, and improving the business environment.13
The authorities indicated that they were preparing competition and anti-monopoly legislation
to support the privatization effort.
31.
No significant reforms in the trade system are expected in the near future.
Despite substantial progress on trade liberalization in recent years, Iran’s simple average
tariff is still around 25 percent and tariff dispersion remains high. The authorities indicated
that no further trade liberalization measures were envisaged before the negotiations for
accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO), which have been halted for political
reasons, could be resumed. They identified the more favorable treatment given by WTO
members to other WTO countries and competition from Asian countries in textiles and
manufactures as the main obstacles faced by Iranian exports.
E. Medium-Term Scenarios
32.
The staff has prepared two illustrative medium-term scenarios: a “baseline”
scenario that assumes the continuation of the authorities’ current policies, and an
“active” scenario that incorporates the staff’s recommendations (Table 9).14 Under the
baseline scenario, real GDP growth is projected to decelerate gradually to 4 percent a year,
with inflation remaining in the double digits. The non-oil fiscal deficit is projected to decline
from 20.4 percent of GDP in 2007/08 to 17.4 percent of GDP over the medium term, on
account of the introduction of the VAT and a reduction in net lending by the OSF. The
external current account would remain in surplus for most of the period, as high oil prices
would encourage a gradual increase in capacity and provide substantial export revenues, but
the surpluses would decline over time. The international reserves cover would decline below
9 months of imports by 2011/12. A US$10 decline in oil prices relative to the baseline would
reduce the current account surplus by about 4 percentage points of GDP. In this case, the
international reserves position would decline gradually to 3 months of imports by the end of
the period.
33.
The active scenario assumes a stronger fiscal effort through the adoption of
additional fiscal measures equivalent, on a net basis, to 2–3½ percent of GDP over the
medium term. Under this scenario, the non-oil fiscal deficit would decline from 18.5 percent
of GDP in 2007/08 to 13.7 percent in 2011/12. Real GDP growth is projected to slow to
4 percent in 2007/08 and 2008/09 in response to the initial impact of the adjustment effort,
13

The World Bank’s 2006 “Doing Business” report ranked Iran number 119 among 175 countries, compared
with 113 in the previous year.
14

Based on the World Economic Outlook (WEO) projections of early December 2006 (for a world oil price of
US$64.5 per barrel in 2007) adjusted for the composition of the Iranian basket; oil prices for Iran in both
scenarios are assumed to decline slightly from US$55 per barrel in 2006/07 to US$54.2 per barrel in 2011/12.

19
before rebounding gradually to 6½–7 percent a year over the medium term. Inflation would
decline gradually, owing to the impact of phased increases in domestic fuel prices.15 The
external current account would remain in surplus throughout the period, with the gross
international reserves cover increasing to about 12 months of imports.
F. Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT)
34.
AML reforms are ongoing in light of vulnerabilities identified by the authorities.
Iran has taken a number of steps in recent years to develop an AML framework. The
authorities recognize that the current framework needs strengthening and have sought the
Fund’s assistance in this regard. An IMF staff team recently visited Tehran to identify key
strengths and weaknesses in this area and help the authorities develop an action plan.
Although money laundering is not criminalized as a specific offence and there is as yet no
framework AML law in place, the CBI issued in 2002 an anti-money laundering regulation
setting out preventive measures for banks and certain other financial institutions. A number
of provisions and the scope of entities covered by the regulation, however, fall short of the
Financial Action Task Force (FATF) standard.
35.
A draft framework AML law is nearing the final stages of the legislative process.
The new law should provide a firmer basis for an AML legal and institutional framework,
inter alia, by criminalizing money laundering, expanding the list of entities covered by the
AML framework, and authorizing the establishment of a Financial Intelligence Unit.
Although a significant step, the draft law, as it stands, does not adequately cover the
requirements of the FATF standard, and leaves a number of important aspects of the
AML/CFT legal framework to by-laws that have yet to be prepared.
36.
With respect to combating the financing of terrorism, while there are measures
in place to address some of the relevant requirements under the FATF Special
Recommendations, there are important shortcomings. Iran’s criminal code includes
terrorism offences, and the CBI has issued circulars requiring banks and nonbank financial
institutions regulated by the CBI to report the accounts of designated terrorist groups. Lists of
suspected terrorists under UN Resolutions 1267 and 1373 are circulated to the banks, but the
mission raised questions about CBI’s legal authority to freeze or block accounts. Although
not specifically designed for CFT, there is also a declaration system in place for cross-border
cash movements, a regulatory system for remittances, and a legal framework for nonprofit
organizations. However, terrorism financing is not an offence under the law, there is no clear
requirement for financial institutions to report suspicious transactions, and FATF
requirements on wire transfers are not in place. The CBI is currently in the early stages of
developing a draft CFT law to strengthen the legal framework in this area.
15

The active scenario assumes that energy prices will be adjusted gradually over the next five years to above
60 percent of border prices.

20
37.
The authorities indicated that both the AML law and the CFT law are being
revised in line with the staff’s recommendations, and that they are in the process of
requesting further assistance from the Fund as they pursue their efforts to strengthen Iran’s
AML/CFT framework.
G. Statistical Issues
38.
While the data provided to consultation missions are generally adequate for
surveillance purposes, the timeliness and availability of key data in between missions
remains inadequate, especially regarding the fiscal and financial sectors. During the
consultation discussions, progress was made in improving the consistency of fiscal data, but
it was not possible to extend the coverage of the fiscal accounts owing to insufficient
information and data deficiencies. Subscription to the SDDS has been delayed because
current dissemination practices are not yet in compliance with SDDS requirements.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
39.
The Iranian economy continued to register robust growth in 2005/06, with
strong performance of the non-oil sector. Economic activity was boosted by a
weather-related recovery of agriculture and a strong policy stimulus. The external current
account surplus rose sharply owing to the large increase in oil revenues, and international
reserves increased further. The near-term growth prospects look favorable, and the external
position is expected to strengthen further in 2006/07. Inflationary pressures, however, have
intensified in recent months. Major downside risks include a sharp drop in oil prices and a
further escalation of the tensions associated with the nuclear issue, which would affect
adversely investment and growth.
40.
The main challenge faced by the authorities is to attain and sustain higher rates
of growth to reduce unemployment, which is still high, while consolidating
macroeconomic stability. This requires the adoption of a consistent set of macroeconomic
policies to lower inflation. It also calls for deepening and accelerating structural reforms,
improving resource allocation, and fostering investor confidence.
41.
A substantial fiscal effort is needed to ease demand pressures and prevent a
large erosion of external competitiveness. The sharp rise in oil revenues in recent years has
been accompanied by a marked widening of the non-oil fiscal deficit, largely on account of
higher government spending. There is a need to reverse this trend by adopting strong
corrective measures. In this regard, the authorities’ intention to seek parliamentary approval
for a VAT by mid-2007/08, and to gradually reduce nonenergy subsidies is welcome.
However, the fiscal effort should also include the early adoption of a plan to phase out
energy subsidies, which have reached staggering levels. This reform will also provide much
needed additional resources for social spending, poverty reduction, and physical
infrastructure.

21
42.
The role of the budget as the main instrument of fiscal policy should be
strengthened. Frequent recourse to the OSF to finance additional spending and lend
resources to the private sector should be avoided, and consideration should be given to
transferring net lending operations to the budget to improve transparency and strengthen
fiscal management.
43.
Monetary policy should be tightened to help reduce inflation. This requires
greater flexibility in the use of monetary instruments accompanied by a gradual lifting of
controls over rates of return. In this connection, the authorities are encouraged to reconsider
the decision taken earlier this year to lower the rate of return on state-owned banks’ lending
and set the rate on private banks’ lending, which was previously freely determined. In
addition, efforts should continue in the context of the discussions on the new Money and
Banking Law to provide the central bank with greater independence to adjust rates of return
and place participation paper as needed to manage liquidity.
44.
Greater exchange rate flexibility is also desirable. Notwithstanding the recent
appreciation experienced by the rial in real effective terms, the present level of the real
exchange rate appears favorable to the tradable goods sector. Efforts aimed at moderating
further real appreciation by preventing a nominal appreciation of the rial are unlikely to be
successful, as the real appreciation would eventually materialize through higher inflation.
The authorities should therefore consider allowing for further exchange rate flexibility to
reduce inflationary pressures. Looking ahead, the main tools to preserve external
competitiveness are increased fiscal discipline and deeper structural reforms.
45.
In the financial sector, priority should be given to phasing out distortionary
regulations and controls in order to promote a more efficient intermediation of
financial savings. There is also a need to increase competition and reduce the role of
state-owned banks, including through a vigorous implementation of the government’s
privatization plans. In addition, efforts should continue to strengthen bank regulation and
supervision, particularly in light of growing financial intermediation and the prospects of
bank privatization. Close attention should be given to the quality of bank portfolios in view
of the strong growth in credit to the private sector in recent years. It is also necessary to
strengthen the draft AML and CFT laws, and to move ahead promptly with their
implementation.
46.
On the structural front, the authorities’ decision to launch an ambitious
privatization program constitutes a welcome, major shift in the orientation of policies.
Ultimately, the success of the program will depend on an effective transfer of majority
control to the private sector and on the implementation of reforms aimed at creating a
level-playing field for private investment and improving the business climate. Regarding
trade issues, further trade liberalization by lowering high tariff rates and reducing tariff
dispersion, regardless of WTO accession negotiations, would be important to strengthen
external competitiveness.

22
47.
Although progress has been made in improving Iran’s macroeconomic statistics
with Fund assistance, further work is needed to subscribe to the SDDS. In particular, the
dissemination practices for some key macroeconomic indicators fall short of SDDS
requirements.
48.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with the Islamic Republic of
Iran be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

Exchange System

The exchange rate is determined in the interbank foreign exchange market. The exchange
rate regime was reclassified, effective January 1, 2005, from the category of managed float
with no predetermined path for the exchange rate to a de facto crawling peg system. With
effect from September 6, 2004, the Islamic Republic of Iran accepted the obligations under
Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement. Iran maintains one
exchange restriction and two multiple currency practices subject to Fund jurisdiction under
Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3.
a.
The exchange restriction arises from limitations set out in the by-laws adopted to
implement the Foreign Investment Promotion and Protection Act on the transferability of
(periodic) rial profits from certain foreign direct investments.

3
b.

The multiple currency practices arise from:

Budget subsidies for foreign exchange purchases in connection with payments of certain
letters of credit opened prior to March 21, 2002 under the previous multiple exchange rate
system; and
Obligations of entities that had received allocations of foreign exchange at subsidized
“allocated rates” under the previous multiple exchange rate system to surrender unused
allocations to the Central Bank of Iran at the allocation rate.

ANNEX II. Islamic Republic of Iran: Relations with the World Bank Group
(As of November 30, 2006)
1.
As of November 30, 2006, Iran had received 54 World Bank loans totaling
$3,163 million net of cancellations and terminations, of which $2,145 million had been
disbursed. The ongoing portfolio consists of nine loans for a total amount of $1,355 million,
of which $1,001 million remain undisbursed.
2.
World Bank lending to Iran resumed in 2000 after a hiatus of seven years. This
coincided with the revival of the government’s large reconstruction effort. Between 2000 and
April 2005, the Board approved several projects: Tehran Sewerage Project, Second Primary
Health Care and Nutrition Project, two Emergency Earthquake Reconstruction projects
(following the Qazwin and Bam earthquakes), Environmental Management, Ahwaz and
Shiraz Water and Sanitation, Urban Upgrading and Housing Reform, Northern Cities Water
and Sanitation, and Alborz Integrated Land and Water Management.
3.
On May 2001, a two-year Interim Assistance Strategy (IAS) was approved by the
Board of Executive Directors. This strategy followed a two-pronged approach: (a) policy
dialogue on the reform program through nonlending services; and (b) targeted lending in key
social and environment areas consistent with the Third FYDP objectives. During the IAS
period, the World Bank undertook a series of economic studies in support of the
government’s reform efforts, which formed the basis for policy dialogue and analysis. These
included a study on the reform of the Energy Pricing System, a Trade and Foreign Exchange
System Reform Study, a Public Expenditure Review, and a Country Economic
Memorandum (CEM), as well as other sectoral studies. In addition, Policy Review Notes
were prepared for urban water, housing, agriculture, and air pollution control. Work is under
way on the pension system and safety nets.
4.
A new four-year Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) is under preparation. The
overarching aim of the new CAS is to assist the government in implementing the structural
reform agenda, supporting the transformation of the economy, promoting high and
sustainable growth, and creating employment opportunities. The CAS puts emphasis on
poverty alleviation and capacity building for a knowledge-based economy. It envisages a
lending program in water and sanitation, urban transport, agriculture, community-based
development, and education and vocational training. The analytical and advisory program
proposes to include public finance, financial and public sector reform, and labor markets and
human capital development, in addition to recently completed or ongoing work on growth
diagnostics as well as public expenditure and pension strategies. The CAS seeks to align its
policy recommendations with the government’s priorities and the objectives of the Fourth
FYDP. To support Iran’s reform efforts, the World Bank is also intensifying its assistance for
capacity building in the formulation, sequencing, and implementation of economic and
sectoral policies.

5
5.
The International Finance Corporation’s (IFC) support of the World Bank’s program
for Iran will focus on selected investments as well as technical assistance and advisory
services. IFC’s activities will focus on the private sector, supporting higher and sustained
growth and accelerating job creation. IFC will support the establishment of a modern, open,
and competitive financial sector, a cornerstone for private sector development. As of
November 30, 2006, IFC’s committed portfolio in Iran was $29 million, primarily in the
financial sector.
6.
Iran became a full member of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA)
in December 2003. In May 2005, MIGA issued $122 million in guarantee coverage for a
joint venture petrochemical project, its first coverage ever for a project in Iran. MIGA also
provided coverage for a small manufacturing plant in Tabriz, in the northwest of Iran, for an
amount of $5 million in December 2005. There appears to be potential demand for MIGA
guarantees among Iranian investors venturing abroad. As Iranian companies become more
aware of MIGA’s potential value added in South-South transactions, MIGA may see more
requests for coverage, particularly in neighboring countries.

6
ANNEX III. Islamic Republic of Iran: Statistical Issues
Data provision to the Fund is generally adequate for effective surveillance; however, the data
are reported with significant delays. The Central Bank of Iran (CBI) disseminates key
statistical aggregates in its quarterly Economic Trends, also available at
<http://www.cbi.ir/e/>. Since 2002, the Fund’s Statistics Department has assisted the
authorities in their efforts to subscribe to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS).
The progress, however, has been slow and gaps in meeting SDDS requirements for data
coverage, periodicity, and timeliness remain.
Real sector statistics
•

National accounts statistics are reasonably sound. Improvements have been made in
the coverage of the informal economy. However, there is scope for further progress,
especially in the coverage of small-scale industries and services. Also, the CBI and
the Statistical Council of Iran (SCI) have undertaken to review and unify their
respective GDP estimates.

•

Price statistics are sound and released in a timely manner. The official labor market
statistics are released by the SCI, and are based on the definitions recommended by
the International Labor Organization (ILO). The data are based on an urban and rural
population sample of about 100,000 households, and the threshold for considering a
person employed is two days a week. Labor market statistics, however, could benefit
from further improvement, particularly with regard to employment and wage data.

Government finance statistics
•

The data are compiled in accordance with the Government Finance Statistics Manual,
2001 (GFSM 2001) for the core central government operations. Starting 2003/04, the
fiscal data include implicit energy subsidies.

•

Data on central government operations cover the general budget, the special purpose
funds, and certain transactions with the Social Security Organization. These data are
not consolidated. There is a need to expand the coverage of central government to
include the complete transactions of the Social Security Organization, four pension
funds, five procurement and distribution centers, and the OSF.

•

The submission for the 2006 Government Finance Statistics Yearbook included for
the first time data for general and local governments.

•

The existing cash-based government accounting system should be upgraded to enable
recording of expenditures at the pre-payment stage.

7
•

Financing data in the GFS are not broken down by residency of debt holders or by
type of debt instruments. The discrepancy between fiscal and monetary data on deficit
financing has often been relatively large, partly due to foreign currency valuation
problems. There is a need to develop a comprehensive database on domestic public
debt, with a breakdown by domestic creditor.

•

The Bonyad-e-Mostazafan va Janbazan (BMJ, Foundation of the Oppressed and
Injured) could be considered a holding company and classified in the nonfinancial
public corporations sector.

Monetary statistics
•

Monthly monetary data are reported to STA on a regular basis for publication in IFS,
but periodicity has been lagging.

•

Compilation of monetary statistics diverges from international standards in the
application of the residency criterion and in sectorization and classification. The
authorities are undertaking improvements in each of these areas, in line with the
recommendations of two recent STA missions.

•

The measure of broad money employed by the CBI does not include deposits of
public nonfinancial corporations, local governments, or foreign-currency deposits of
residents.

External sector data
•

The accounting system for foreign exchange receipts and payments of the CBI and
banks is being implemented in line with the methodological guidelines of the Fund’s
Balance of Payments Manual, fifth edition (BPM5). This will allow compilation of
balance of payments statistics on a quarterly basis. Annual balance of payments data
up to 2000 have been reported to STA for publication in BOPSY and IFS.

•

Data on the international investment position are compiled, but not disseminated.
Only data on public and publicly guaranteed debt are disseminated, but classifications
do not fully accord with the guidelines of the External Debt Guide. The data template
on international reserves and foreign currency liquidity is not compiled.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
February 23, 2007
This statement updates the information provided in the staff report for the 2006 Article IV
consultation with the Islamic Republic of Iran that was issued on February 1, 2007. The new
information does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
•

Following the downward revision of the WEO oil price baseline on January 22, 2007,
the staff has updated the medium-term macroeconomic projections presented in the
staff report. The lower oil prices would increase the fiscal deficit and reduce the
current account surplus relative to the staff report’s “current policies” scenario by
about 2¾ percentage points of GDP, on average, over the medium term. Gross
international reserves would be $41 billion (4½ months of imports) by the end of
2011/12. These projections are subject to a high degree of uncertainty, as oil prices
remain volatile. Moreover, the authorities are considering significant measures to
strengthen the fiscal position (see below).

•

End-of-period inflation increased to 15.9 percent in December 2006, from
14.7 percent in November. The rial has remained stable vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar in the
past two months. Parliament recently approved the issuance of Rls 10 trillion (close to
4 percent of base money) in central bank participation papers (CBPPs) to help absorb
liquidity. This is in addition to the issuance of Rls 20 trillion in CBPPs, which had
already been approved by parliament.

•

The fiscal outturn for 2006/07 is now likely to be significantly better than projected.
The staff report’s fiscal projections for 2006/07 included an additional budgetary
appropriation of Rls 45 trillion (2¼ percent of GDP), to be financed mainly by
resources from the Oil Stabilization Fund, which was expected to be approved before
the end of the fiscal year. Following parliamentary opposition, the government scaled
down the requested appropriation to Rls 30 trillion (1½ percent of GDP). However,
the proposed amendment bill has been rejected by the Plan and Budget Commission
and has not been approved by parliament.

•

The 2007/08 budget was submitted to parliament in late January 2007. Based on
preliminary information, the proposed budget is based on a conservative oil price of
US$33.7 per barrel, compared with US$46.9 per barrel implied in the new WEO oil
price baseline. The budget proposal envisages a non-oil fiscal deficit of about
14½ percent of GDP, compared with 20½ percent of GDP in the staff report, owing to
substantial cuts in current outlays. In particular, the proposal envisages cuts in the
subsidies on selected nonenergy items and a reduction in gasoline imports, which are
financed through the budget. The reduction in gasoline imports will be supported by
the introduction of a rationing scheme. While the proposed fiscal retrenchment is very
ambitious, the parliamentary discussion of the budget and its implementation are
likely to involve changes.

2

•

The authorities informed the staff that the share of deposits held by private banks rose
from 10½ percent of total deposits in March 2006 to 15 percent in November.

•

The authorities have taken steps to improve the timeliness of data dissemination. In
January 2007, the Central Bank of Iran started disseminating on its website the monthly
electronic publication Selective Economic Indicators. In addition, the Tehran Stock
Exchange plans to disseminate market data and related information, including English
translations of rules and regulations.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
March 5, 2007

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation with the
Islamic Republic of Iran
On February 23, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with the Islamic Republic of Iran.1
Background
With high oil prices and a significant policy stimulus, the Iranian economy continued to grow
strongly in 2005/06 (fiscal year starts March 21). Real GDP growth is estimated at 5½ percent.
Oil GDP growth was modest owing to capacity constraints, while non-oil GDP growth was
broad-based, reaching 6 percent. The tensions associated with the nuclear issue, however, had
some adverse effects on private investment. Unemployment remains relatively high
(10.2 percent in the first half of 2006/07).
End-of-period inflation decelerated to 10.2 percent in 2005/06, owing to a fall in food prices and
a slower rate of depreciation of the rial. After declining further to below 7 percent in April 2006,
the 12-month rate of inflation increased in recent months, reaching 15.9 percent in
December 2006. The rial remained broadly stable in nominal effective terms during the
18 months ended in September 2006. Owing to the inflation differential with its trading partners,
Iran’s real effective exchange rate appreciated by 11 percent over the same period.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
Financial policies have been expansionary during the last two fiscal years. Although the overall
fiscal position is projected to be in surplus, the central government non-oil deficit (commitment
basis) is expected to increase to 17¾ percent of GDP in 2006/07, from 14¼ percent in 2004/05.
Large spending out of oil revenues has continued to challenge the ability of the Central Bank of
Iran to meet its monetary targets. Broad money increased at an annual rate of about 35 percent
in 2005/06 and the first half of 2006/07, and credit to the private sector has continued to grow at
a strong pace. In March 2006, the authorities lowered the rate of return (interest rate) on state
banks’ lending and set the rate on private banks’ lending, which was previously freely
determined. After a sharp correction experienced in 2005/06, prices in the Tehran Stock
Exchange recovered somewhat in April–December 2006.
External indicators continued to improve in 2005/06. The current account surplus rose to
7½ percent of GDP, from 1¼ percent in 2004/05, reflecting higher crude prices and a strong
performance of non-oil exports. Gross international reserves, including those in the Oil
Stabilization Fund (OSF), rose to the equivalent of nine months of imports of goods and
nonfactor services at end-September 2006, and the external debt declined.
Although the pace of structural reforms slowed during the initial period of the current
administration, the government has recently provided new impetus to the privatization program.
Following the amendment to Article 44 of the constitution and an executive order by Iran’s
supreme leader, the authorities intend to privatize some 80 percent of the state-owned
companies over the next 10 years (excluding the upstream oil sector, crucial infrastructure, and
some banks).
With energy prices projected to remain high and external demand continuing to support non-oil
exports, Iran’s near-term growth prospects look favorable. Real GDP growth is projected at
5.8 percent in 2006/07 on account of continued strong activity in the non-oil sector. Inflation is
likely to remain entrenched in the double digits. The external current account surplus is
projected to decline owing to the fiscal expansion, but the international reserves position is
expected to strengthen further during the remainder of 2006/07. An escalation of the tensions
associated with the nuclear program could, however, affect adversely the growth outlook.
The 2007/08 draft budget was submitted to parliament in late January 2007. The proposed
budget is based on a conservative oil price and envisages a reduction in the central government
non-oil deficit to about 14½ percent of GDP in 2007/08, owing to substantial cuts in current
outlays, including subsidies.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended Iran’s continued robust economic growth and improved
external position, which reflected both a strong performance of the non-oil sector and favorable
oil market conditions. Directors expressed concern, however, that macroeconomic policies
continue to be expansionary and this is fueling inflationary pressures. They noted also that the
possibility of a sustained drop in oil prices poses an additional risk to Iran’s fiscal sustainability
and macroeconomic outlook.

3
Directors considered Iran’s main challenges to be the continued transition toward a viable and
efficient market economy, and the attainment of the sustained growth rates necessary to
provide employment for the country’s fast-growing labor force. Directors reiterated that, to meet
these challenges, the authorities will need to tighten financial policies and accelerate structural
reforms in order to ensure macroeconomic stability and external competitiveness, build investor
confidence, and accelerate further the development of the non-oil private sector.
Against this background, Directors called for a more restrictive fiscal stance to ease demand
pressures and prevent an erosion of external competitiveness. They welcomed the authorities’
plans to restrain expenditures in 2007/08, introduce a value added tax in the near future, and
improve tax administration. In this context, Directors underscored the importance of phasing out
energy subsidies while adequately protecting the poor, prioritizing expenditure, strengthening
the role of the budget as the main instrument of fiscal policy, and avoiding frequent recourse to
the OSF to finance spending. Efforts to increase public awareness of the importance of these
reforms will be essential to garner the necessary public support.
Directors also called for a tightening of monetary policy and more effective use of monetary
instruments. In this regard, they stressed that the central bank needs greater independence to
issue short-term paper as needed to absorb liquidity. More generally, Directors encouraged the
authorities to gradually lift controls on banks’ rates of return and phase out remaining credit
allocations.
Many Directors supported greater exchange rate flexibility, noting that it would buffer the
economy against external shocks and increase the effectiveness of monetary policy in
controlling inflation. They emphasized that competitiveness is better enhanced through fiscal
discipline and appropriate structural reforms. Some Directors instead favored nominal exchange
rate stability.
Directors commended the progress made in developing a risk-based prudential framework and
broadening the supervisory powers of the central bank. They encouraged the authorities to
continue strengthening prudential supervision and regulation. Directors also urged that the
impact of ongoing rapid credit expansion on the quality of banks’ portfolios should be monitored
closely. They welcomed the fact that the authorities have recognized that the current
Anti-Money Laundry framework needs strengthening, and encouraged them to reinforce and
quickly adopt the draft laws against money laundering and terrorism financing.
Directors welcomed the renewed momentum to privatize state-owned enterprises, including
some of the largest banks. They urged vigorous design and implementation of an appropriate
regulatory framework within the privatization program to ensure a level playing field and to
enhance competition and efficiency in the economy. They noted that the success of the
program in stimulating private investment will depend, in large part, on the effective transfer of
majority control to the private sector and on the implementation of reforms to improve the
business climate.

4
Directors welcomed recent improvements in the timeliness of macroeconomic data
dissemination. They encouraged further progress on enhancing the availability of data,
extending the coverage of the fiscal accounts, and bringing the dissemination practices for
some key macroeconomic indicators in line with the IMF’s Special Data Dissemination
Standards.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Abbas Mirakhor, Executive Director
for the Islamic Republic of Iran
February 23, 2007
1.
The authorities gratefully acknowledge the work of the IMF mission and appreciate
the policy dialogue with staff. As stated during the Board discussions of last year’s Article IV
consultations, the platform of the then newly elected government focused on: (i) acceleration
of growth aimed at increasing the pace of job creation with particular emphasis on expansion
of activities by small- and medium-size enterprises and enhancing the absorptive capacity of
the economy through public investment to remove infrastructural bottlenecks; and (ii) more
equitable geographic distribution of resources to reduce large and widening regional
disparities. These objectives have been pursued with a strong commitment to the strategic
objective of the Fourth Five-Year Development Plan (FFYDP, covering the period 2004-09)
of developing the non-oil sector of the economy with increasing reliance on the private sector
as the engine of growth and using additional oil revenues for this purpose.
2.
The fiscal stimulus led to faster and broad-based GDP growth of 5.4 percent in
2005/06, compared to 4.8 percent in the previous year. For the sixth year in a row, growth
rate of the non-oil sector, at 6 percent, outpaced the overall growth of the economy; non-oil
exports grew at a significantly faster rate than expected; the current account registered a
five-year high surplus; the outstanding stock of debt declined and its profile, which had been
a staff concern, shifted to longer maturities; and gross official and Oil Stabilization Fund
(OSF) reserves increased. In addition to open market operations, the central bank tightened
access to its overdraft facility and the rate of depreciation of domestic currency decelerated
resulting in a smaller nominal effective depreciation leading to a decline in the CPI inflation
rate to 12.1 percent from 15.2 percent a year earlier. The benchmark ex ante rate of return on
the central bank’s participation paper remained positive in real terms. Credit to the private
sector increased substantially while directed credit remained limited to the agriculture and
water sectors at 25 percent (down from 55 percent in 2003/04), and credit subsidies to
medium- and small-size firms were fully and transparently reflected in the budget.
3.
While the oil-GDP growth has been modest in 2006/07, continued strong growth of
the non-oil GDP has strengthened further the momentum of the broad-based growth of
overall GDP to a projected 5.8 percent. Unemployment declined to 10.2 percent in the first
half of 2006/07, compared to 10.9 percent in the same period of 2005/06; the external sector
has been enhanced; non-oil exports have continued their robust growth, notwithstanding the
real effective appreciation; imports have declined after a sharp increase in the last two years;
and reserves have increased. Fiscal stimulus intensified inflationary pressures in the second
half of 2006/07 as additional liquidity challenged the management of monetary policy by the
central bank which moved to limit the inflationary impact by further constraining access to
its overdraft facility and carried out open-market operations. Moreover, exchange rate policy
continued to support monetary policy through slower depreciation. Additional IRls 10,000
billion of the central bank participation paper have been authorized for sale during the
remaining period of this Iranian calendar year (ending March 20, 2007) to reinforce the
monetary policy stance.

4.
For 2007/08, efforts are being made to offset, as much and as soon as possible, the
inflationary impact of fiscal expansion of the last two years by rebalancing macro policies.
Accordingly, the 2007/08 Budget—submitted recently by the Government to the
Parliament—envisages a significant fiscal contraction of 3.4 percent of GDP in real terms.
Monetary policy is set to support fiscal tightening by absorbing substantial liquidity through
open market operations to the tune of IRls 30,000 billion. Exchange rate policy, within the
context of the managed floating regime, will continue to support disinflation efforts through a
slower pace of nominal depreciation. Early indication is that the Government intends to
maintain a tight fiscal stance through 2008/09 with continued support from strong
performance of the non-oil revenues, as was the case in 2006/07, which is to be further
enhanced after the upcoming implementation of the VAT.
5.
Progress in implementation of the structural reform agenda, envisioned in the
FFYDP, has gained significant momentum with the decision in 2006/07 to amend Article 44
of the Constitution to allow privatization of some 80 percent of state-owned enterprises. The
list includes large-scale industries and banks; eight large companies with a book value of
US$4.6 billion (market value estimated at US$16 billion) are going through the final stage of
privatization as their shares are placed on the Tehran Stock Exchange (TSE). In addition, the
most recent large company being sold (February 3) on the TSE is National Copper
Manufacturing with a book value of US$620 million (market value estimated at
US$2.5 billion). The recently approved by-laws authorizing foreign portfolio investment
should strengthen the operations of the TSE. In conjunction with the decision on massive
privatization, the Government has actively solicited the views of the private sector through
Chambers of Commerce on how best to facilitate the process of empowerment of the private
sector to assume management of the portion of the economy being devolved to this sector
through privatization. A program to improve the business and investment environment and to
reduce the cost of doing business is being designed and articulated. Much has been said about
the urgency to reform the subsidy system and need not be repeated here. Suffice it to say that
the authorities are fully cognizant that the subsidies are inefficient, embody harmful
economic and environmental externalities, and are the Achilles’ heel of the medium-term
fiscal sustainability, undermining the efforts to achieve the full potential growth of the
economy. However, given the more than half a century history of subsidies and their deeply
entrenched nature, the authorities believe that a strong social consensus and significant public
support are needed before undertaking meaningful reforms. They further believe that such
support could be garnered once an effective and efficient public transportation system is in
place that would obviate the need to rely on private means of transportation and cash
transfers to those adversely affected by reforms become a viable option. Meanwhile, they
intend to press ahead with the implementation of the smart card system to limit subsidized
consumption of refined petroleum. As a result, the 2007/08 proposed Budget envisages
substantial reduction in subsidies for higher-income groups. Further efforts will be made to
expand reliance on natural gas as a substitute for petroleum.
6.
In the financial sector, private sector banks continued their robust growth as their
market share has increased to 15 percent (as of November 2006), compared to 10.5 a year
earlier, and licensing applications to establish new banks continued to be submitted to the
central bank despite a sharp and sizable increase in the required level of start-up capital. This

3
trend is expected to accelerate with the privatization of four large state-owned banks. A
recent MCM Department mission, which the authorities welcomed, concluded that
considerable progress has been made by the central bank in strengthening financial sector
supervision and regulation; further improvements are underway through ongoing revisions of
the banking and central bank laws. In addition to enhancing the central bank’s independence
in monetary management, these revisions will broaden the range of financial institutions
subject to its supervision and will increase its autonomy and accountability in regulatory and
supervisory matters. While the non-performing loans have increased by 2 percentage points,
the supervisory authorities believe that much of this increase is due to a recent shift to a more
stringent classification as well as improved accounting, reporting, and transparency
standards. At the authorities’ request, a recent and much appreciated TA mission from the
Legal Department has reviewed progress to date in the AML/CFT reform initiatives and has
made valuable recommendations which the authorities are studying as they revise AML draft
law and prepare CFT legislation.
7.
Regarding recent decisions of the US authorities relating to two Iranian banks, it is
important that the suggestion that these decisions “cut off” these banks “from direct and
indirect access to the US financial system” (paragraph 29 of the staff report) be placed in the
proper context. The comprehensive US sanctions regime in place for more than a decade had
already covered nearly all bilateral financial transactions. The exception, before recent
decisions, had been the so called concept of the “U-Turn,” according to which Iranian banks
could turn around US dollar oil earnings through the US financial system to pay for
international dollar transactions (e.g., payment for medicine purchases from the US permitted
under the sanctions regime). The recent decisions have prohibited U-Turn transactions by the
two Iranian banks, in effect, widening the coverage of the sanctions regime from ostensibly
bilateral to international restrictions on not only these banks’ access to international trade and
financial system, but also on other countries or financial institutions to transact with these
banks in US dollar. The authorities believe these decisions constitute violations of members’
obligations under the IMF Articles of Agreement. They further believe that using
international financial restrictions to settle bilateral political disputes undermines the integrity
and credibility of the international financial system to the detriment of the global economy.
They contend that the IMF, as the sentinel of the international financial system, has statutory
responsibility to protect not only the right of its individual members to unrestricted access to
the international financial system, but also the global integrity of that system.
