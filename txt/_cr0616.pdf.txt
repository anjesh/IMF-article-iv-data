Executive Summary
Germany faces serious economic challenges and needs decisive, forward-looking
policies to raise employment, investment, and output growth. Germany is wealthy but has
a highly regulated economy that is financing a generous welfare state. Rigidities from this
structure impose long adjustment periods after shocks such as unification, rapid regional and
global economic integration, and pressures from aging. Problems manifest themselves in
three interrelated features:
•

Low and declining trend growth, and most recently weak domestic demand despite
strong exports.

•

High and long-lasting unemployment, with high reservation wages and gross labor
costs.

•

Persistent fiscal pressures, and public finances and welfare programs that are not
sustainable under current policies.

Implementing a sound reform strategy with a clear timetable offers the best prospect
for building confidence and revitalizing growth. The staff recommends that the strategy
encompass the following mutually-reinforcing elements:
•

Fiscal consolidation to reach structural balance by 2010 and help secure long run
fiscal sustainability. Emphasis should be on reducing distortions via cutting subsidies
and tax expenditures, recalibrating entitlement benefits, cutting payroll taxes, and
raising the retirement age. Institutional reforms to improve incentives for better fiscal
management are also important.

•

Labor market reforms to reduce high unemployment and raise labor utilization, thus
limiting the effects of aging on growth and public finances. Reforms need to facilitate
job creation and include: allowing wage setting to reflect local labor market
imbalances and productivity differentials; switching central wage bargaining to the
firm level; and cutting employment protection legislation to boost employment of the
most vulnerable workers.

•

Product and services market reforms to boost the effectiveness of labor market
reforms. By increasing competition in product and services markets, wage moderation
will be passed on to lower prices, and result in faster output and employment growth.
Regulations and administrative hurdles need to be reduced to make the business
climate more conducive to job creation, particularly in the service sector.

•

Financial sector reforms to make the sector more dynamic and place it in a better
position to support growth. The banking sector’s continued fragmentation limits
economies of scale and risk diversification. Abolishing limits on intraregional

-6-

competition and opening up public sector banks to private capital would facilitate
market driven restructuring, foster returns to scale, and bolster profitability.
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
The discussions took place against the backdrop of low trend growth, persistent
fiscal pressures, and Chancellor Schröder’s call for early elections. Since the 2004
Article IV consultation, the authorities’ main policy initiative has been implementing the farreaching Hartz IV labor market reforms in January 2005.1 These were part of Agenda 2010,
which provided a forceful start in addressing Germany’s deep seated structural problems
(Box 1). Implementing Hartz IV, however, has proved more challenging than expected and
continued high unemployment has sapped public confidence. Following the ruling coalition’s
loss in the key state elections of North Rhine-Westphalia in May, just prior to the
consultation mission Chancellor Schröder called for federal elections in September, one year
early in the government’s term, to seek a new mandate for reforms. These surprise elections
restricted the depth and specificity of the forward-looking policy discussions. Nevertheless,
the authorities welcomed the opportunity to assess economic policy challenges that need to
be tackled by any future government, and it was agreed that the discussions would continue
in November following the elections. A supplement will report on these follow-up
discussions.
II. BACKGROUND
2.
German exports are flourishing but domestic demand continues to languish,
resulting in a tepid and unbalanced recovery. Weak domestic demand is driven in large
part by necessary adjustments as Germany rebuilds its competitiveness through wage
moderation and other efforts by companies and government to improve efficiency and lower
costs. Considerable progress has been made in this adjustment process, but persistent weak
economic performance—despite strong global growth, accommodative interest rates, and a
broadly neutral fiscal policy—suggests that Germany’s problems are structural rather than
cyclical.
3.
Labor market conditions are difficult and sentiment is weak. The creation of new
jobs continues to be stifled by wage rigidities and regulatory hurdles, and the increase in the
labor force resulting from the Hartz IV reforms triggered a rise in unemployment to
12 percent (5 million persons, national definition; 9.5 percent on Eurostat definition) in
early 2005. This damaged consumer sentiment and muted the government's enthusiasm for
additional reforms. High unemployment continues to restrain wage demands, keeping core
CPI inflation low at 1 percent, although rising commodity prices have lifted headline
inflation to about 2 percent so far this year (Figure 1).
1

The Hartz IV reforms merged the long-term unemployment program and social assistance into a single new
Unemployment Benefits II (UB-II) program, with lower average benefits and expanded means testing and job
search requirements. UB-II is managed jointly by the Federal Labor Office and local governments.

Box 1. Past Fund Policy Recommendations and Implementation
In recent consultations, Directors have welcomed the path breaking reforms of Agenda 2010,
which were in line with longstanding Fund recommendations. At the same time, they noted
that these initiatives needed to be augmented to help overcome the high costs of unification,
cope with globalization, and anticipate the pressures from aging.
Fiscal consolidation: Directors endorsed the objective to reduce the structural deficit by
1.5 percent of GDP during 2004–06, but the structural deficit is projected to decline only by
0.4 percent of GDP over this period. Efforts to cut tax expenditures and subsidies have met
with little success, and discussions by a parliamentary commission to reform Germany’s
complex federal structure and intergovernmental relations were broken off without
agreement.
Labor market reforms: Directors have supported Germany’s sustained wage moderation
and the successive Hartz (I-III) reforms to help overcome the labor cost shock of unification
and strengthen incentives to work. Also, wage determination has become more decentralized
de-facto, but there are still constraints on firm-level bargaining. Employment protection
legislation, although streamlined, continues to be tight. Most recently, the authorities
proceeded with the implementation of the difficult Hartz IV reform. However, political
compromises complicated operational aspects of the reform, including overlapping
responsibilities between different agencies, incomplete enforcement of eligibility
requirements, and some rollback of the reform for elderly workers.
Pension reforms: The introduction of a “sustainability formula” to slow future pension
increases was a central feature of Agenda 2010. However, the formula was suspended
for 2005, its first year of operation, due to a safeguard clause intended to prevent nominal
pension cuts. The recommendation to shift the pensionable age from 65 to 67 has not been
followed up.
Financial sector: Supervision is improving in line with the 2003 FSAP recommendations,
including by strengthening regulations for reinsurance. Directors also called for reducing
impediments to a market driven restructuring of the banking system. Although some
Landesbanken have converted into joint-stock companies, overall restructuring is proceeding
slowly and the system remains segmented. Good progress is underway in bolstering capital
markets, as demonstrated by the fast growth in asset-backed securities.

Exports are the bright spot, based on improved competitiveness and a favorable
product mix (Box 2). Business restructuring, cost cutting, sustained wage moderation, and
low inflation and unit-labor cost growth have helped rebuild competitiveness after the surge
in costs associated with unification. Germany’s export mix—dominated by capital goods—
has been favored by the global upswing in investment, which has been an additional
important factor underlying this success. Moreover, Germany’s exports are oriented to fast
growing and oil producing countries, and have gained market share both outside and inside
the euro area (text charts and Figure 2). The external current account surplus is projected to
be over 4 percent of GDP in 2005.

By contrast, household
consumption remains weak. Slow growth
in household consumption is consistent with
fundamentals as wage moderation
contributed to slow disposable household
income growth and wealth formation was
weak in part due to stagnant real asset prices
(Box 3). At the same time, saving has
increased as households have been lowering
their high debt and scaling down their
earnings expectations in view of
permanently lower growth and cuts in future
entitlement benefits.

Box 2. Competitiveness
Export strength. Germany became the world’s largest exporter in dollar value in 2004, surpassing the
U.S. This development is seen as an indication of recovering competitiveness, following the cost
pressures incurred in the early 1990s with unification.
Improving labor productivity. Labor productivity in Germany has grown faster than the EU-15
average. Combined with sustained wage moderation, this has resulted in Germany’s ULC falling by
8 percent relative to the EU-15 since the start of EMU.
Global demand strength. While adjustment efforts have contributed to slow domestic demand, strong
global demand boosted Germany’s export volume growth to 9 percent in 2004, substantially higher than
the previous year. Econometric estimates suggest that Germany’s exports are more elastic to changes in
global demand than to price and REER developments.1

Favorable trade linkages. In addition to the strength in global demand, Germany’s ties to fast growing
markets were also major factors for Germany’s export success. Germany has greater exposure to new
EU members, Asia, and the U.S. than most EU partner countries.

Box 3. German Consumption Growth—a Regional Comparison
Consumption growth has been slow. In the last three upswings, during a period of six quarters
following the trough, German consumption rebounded by more than 4 percentage points. By contrast, in
the six quarters since the last trough in the fourth quarter of 2003, consumption has stagnated. Other EU
members have had much stronger consumption growth.
Income growth has been weak. During 1996–2004 real disposable household income grew by
0.6 percent a year, reflecting slow employment growth and wage moderation. This underperformed the
euro area by 1 percentage point a year.
Household saving edged higher. Difficult but necessary cuts in entitlement and unemployment benefits
reduced income. Fears about potential job losses may have also led to higher precautionary savings.
Household savings rose by 1.4 percentage point to 10.6 percent between 2000 and 2004. The increase in
the household saving rate in the EU was about 0.6 percentage points through 2003.
Wealth formation in Germany trailed the international average. Net wealth, mainly comprising
housing stock, increased little during 1996–2003, reflecting flat housing prices. In France, Italy, Spain
and the U.K., rising home prices boosted wealth.1
...reflecting slow growth in wealth and income.

Despite improvements in profitability, companies are still cautious about
investing in Germany (Figure 3). Salient factors are:
•

Profit growth is concentrated in large export companies, which are integrating
their operations into global production chains. This has been illustrated by the
steady rise of imports of intermediate inputs for exports. Thus, a growing share of
investment is taking place abroad where cost bases are lower2—and where demand is
expanding faster—thereby dampening the stimulus from exports to domestic demand.

•

Capacity utilization is below average and domestic cost cutting—rather than
demand growth—has been the main factor driving profitability. Against this
background, manufacturers continue to reduce domestic employment.

•

Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have weaker finances and are more
oriented toward domestic activity. SMEs undertake about half of domestic
investment. With low equity, they depend heavily on the banking system for their
financing, which only recently began relaxing lending standards after a period of
tightening with the advent of risk-weighted lending and other structural changes in
the financial sector. SME financial ratios under perform those of large enterprises in
Germany and fall short in international comparisons.3 Thus, adjustment in SMEs
appears incomplete.

•

Balance sheet repair is unfinished. The
business sector debt-GDP ratio has
improved but remains elevated by historical
and international standards. Corporate cash
flow is still mostly used for debt reduction
rather than investment.

Private sector credit has been declining in real terms. Although monetary
conditions are accommodating, survey data suggest that the demand for credit has continued
to decline owing to a combination of weak economic activity and the efforts by firms and
households to reduce debt. Analysis also suggests that banks with weaker capitalization
curtailed the supply of credit in 2003–04, although these constraints are now beginning to
ease.4 More generally, preparation for Basle II has been a force for changed behavior by
German banks, especially the greater focus on risk differentiation. Falling demand for credit,
combined with a renewed targeting by private sector banks of SMEs, has heightened
competition, triggering a narrowing of lending spreads (Figures 4 and 5).
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
9.
In the staff’s view, a comprehensive forward-looking strategy is needed to raise
employment, investment, and output growth. This strategy needs to be decisive, but
implementation could be graduated along a well-specified path, with particular focus on
dealing with aging and consolidating public finances and reducing distortions, especially in
the labor markets. The call for early federal elections, however, constrained the authorities’
ability to outline concrete policy plans for the future. Nevertheless, the authorities agreed that
moving beyond the reforms of Agenda 2010 is imperative to confront the challenges of low
growth and high unemployment and address strains on the generous welfare system from
demographic change, and also to make full use of the opportunities from greater economic
integration both in the expanded EU and worldwide. Moreover, given its size and importance
for the region, firm policy leadership by Germany to tackle structural constraints on domestic
demand would help reinvigorate growth in Europe, contribute to a reduction in global

provided an opportunity to take stock and to discuss the outlines of a possible time-consistent
fiscal and structural reform strategy for the post-election period.
A. The Economic Outlook
10.
There was agreement that growth in 2005 would be subdued and the outlook
was one of only gradual strengthening into 2006. Investment in machinery and equipment
is slowly turning up and rising employment and progress in balance sheet repair are expected
eventually to assist a broader recovery. The staff forecasts growth of 0.8 percent in 2005 and
1.2 percent in 2006 (the authorities project slightly higher growth in both years). Adjusting
for differences in working days, this implies a slow recovery as signs of accelerating activity
are still tentative.5 With continued support from the global expansion (albeit at a decelerating
pace) and low euro area interest rates, domestic demand is projected to become stronger
moving into 2006 (Figures 6 and 7).

11.
The risks to the outlook are broadly neutral, but with domestic demand still
weak there is considerable uncertainty about the projections. On the positive side,
adjustment efforts are beginning to improve the conditions for a recovery and the downbeat
mood might give way to renewed confidence, especially if the elections provide impetus for
reform. Exports could yet spark a stronger response in domestic demand and productivity
gains spurred by recent reforms may also be greater than assumed. On the downside, the
reliance on cyclical exports, combined with the slow response of domestic demand despite
strong foreign demand, amplifies Germany’s vulnerability to external developments. Firms’
wait-and-see stance about new investment may persist. Companies may also wait to see what
effect higher oil prices will have on consumer and external demand.6 Further, despite signs
that the labor market is stabilizing, fears about job security and slow wage growth continue to
hurt consumer confidence. The authorities were in broad agreement with this assessment and
were particularly concerned about the impact of stubbornly high oil prices and a sudden
unwinding of global imbalances and associated risks for German exports. They were also
apprehensive about the euro appreciating and becoming more volatile, but expected that
greater flexibility in Asia’s managed exchange rate regimes might alleviate some of the risks
for the euro.
12.
For the longer term, the most critical element in the outlook is the impact of
aging on potential output growth. A growth-accounting framework shows that on current
policies potential output growth would fall from 1.4 percent a year at present to about
1 percent in the long run, although per capita growth would be more robust at 1-1½ percent a
year.7 This decline is largely due to the forceful headwinds from the aging-related decline in
labor supply and hours worked.8 This is a problem not only of the future but also of the
present, because, in contrast to most other European countries, Germany’s working age
population has already begun to decline.9 Deeper reforms that boosted participation rates and
triggered a sharp decline in unemployment would attenuate the decline in potential output
growth. However, such an outcome cannot be realized with current policies and relative
factor prices. The mission therefore stressed that it will be important for the next government
to build on the Agenda 2010 reforms by improving incentives and fostering higher labor
utilization and potential output growth, which would also ease the strain on public finances.

6

Simulations suggest that a permanent 10 percent increase in oil prices, at constant exchange rates, reduces real
GDP by 0.2 percentage points a year for three years. Progress in reducing the economy’s oil use intensity since
the 1980s and export resilience (including to oil producing countries) so far have cushioned the impact of the
recent steep oil price increases on the German economy.

rate of 8 percent. T he optimist ic/reform scenario assumes the implementation of

B. Fiscal Policy
Fiscal consolidation
13.
Germany’s high fiscal deficit is largely structural, reflecting adverse trends in
the main tax bases and a generous welfare system. The weakness in labor markets and the
need for wage moderation, in the context of an increasingly competitive global environment,
have contributed to a secular decline in the labor share of national income. With two-thirds of
all revenue derived from wage income, there has been a steady erosion of the fiscal revenue
base (Box 4).10 Moreover, social transfers and unemployment insurance costs have increased
sharply in recent years, underscoring the feedback from poor labor utilization to the fiscal
position.
14.
These adverse trends will intensify in the future, making corrective action
urgent. The mission’s projections suggest that, on current policies, the structural deficit will
widen further in the future because of the acceleration in population aging starting in 2010
and the corresponding slowing of the economy. These widening deficits would lead to long-

10

- 23 -

Box 4. Why is Germany’s Fiscal Deficit so Large?
The recent fiscal deficits of 3½–4 percent of GDP are the largest in the last six decades. They are
also larger than in the 1990s during unification. No sudden shocks explain the current deficits, but the
persistent pressures from globalization and aging are changing the structure of production and forcing
firms to contain wage costs. The procyclical fiscal policies during 1998–2000, when growth was
strong, have also contributed to current difficulties.
Changes in Germany’s economic structure have gradually eroded the tax base and caused new
spending pressures. The main tax base is labor income, which yields about two-thirds of all fiscal
revenue. This dependence exceeds even that of the Scandinavian countries. However, the labor income
share in GDP has been declining over time, while the cost of unemployment insurance has increased.
In response, and under German legislation, payroll tax rates have increased from 26 percent in 1970 to
42 percent at present, putting further pressure on labor markets. Employment gains have shifted to
low-wage and part-time jobs, away from full-time/full-benefits jobs. Correspondingly, the number of
jobs subject to social security contributions has declined. As a policy implication, shifting some
revenue collection toward indirect taxes combined with further entitlement reforms could alleviate the
pressure on payroll charges and lower employment costs.

Thus, despite adjustment efforts in 2003–04, the structural deficit remains high. Tight
management of public investment, the wage bill, and other discretionary spending, and the
unanticipated benefit of low interest rates have helped to offset the revenue losses associated with the
income tax cuts. But the additional pressures on the deficit from a changing structure of production
and aggregate demand and aging have not yet been overcome. Efforts to address these new pressures
have included limits on pensions, health, and unemployment benefits. Nevertheless, the structural
fiscal deficit remains over 3 percent of GDP. Without further steps, demographic shifts and rising
interest rates are likely to continue to intensify the fiscal headwinds in future.

run debt sustainability problems. Even in more optimistic scenarios with higher growth and
lower unemployment, as in the authorities’ first Long-Run Fiscal Sustainability Report, the
fiscal gap would still widen sharply, making it necessary to take action to bring public
finances in line with long run sustainability (Figure 8).11
15.
A public sector balance sheet showing the government’s unsustainable
intertemporal position under current policies provides further insight into the size of
this fiscal challenge (Box 5).12 An illustrative balance sheet estimated by the mission
combines information on government assets and liabilities with the net present value (NPV)
of future fiscal deficits from the long run fiscal baseline described above. At over 300 percent
of GDP, the resulting estimate of the net liability position of the public sector underscores
Germany’s unsustainable intertemporal fiscal position and the need to address the issue headon. The long run impact of the measures of Agenda 2010, which are estimated to have
reduced the NPV of future deficits by 70 percent of GDP, is large but insufficient to address
the threat to fiscal sustainability. Nevertheless, bringing this information to the public, with
regular updates, would help to show the long run benefits of such difficult reforms.13
16.
The authorities agreed that future deficit pressures are a serious concern and
have ruled out expansionary fiscal policies to boost growth, but indicated that the
deficit would still remain high in 2005 and 2006. They noted that substantial discretionary
spending cuts had been implemented over the past two years during a period of weak growth
to compensate for tax cuts, but they were reluctant to make significant additional cuts in a
period of slow recovery. On current policies, the staff projects a general government deficit
of 3.9 percent of GDP in 2005 (compared with 3.7 percent projected by the authorities), and
little improvement in 2006. Apart from growth being weaker than originally forecast, the
authorities explained that unexpected developments had complicated budgetary execution
in 2005, resulting in a wide deviation from the original 2005 fiscal deficit objective of
3 percent of GDP:

11

The authorities’ scenarios are more optimistic because of higher growth and lower unemployment, and
because they assume that the government will achieve its financial plan through 2008 (Mittelfristiger
Finanzplan). However, this plan is off-track, making the starting position too optimistic. Both the authorities’
and staff projections assume that higher future entitlement expenditures are not automatically financed with
higher payroll taxes—to avoid negative repercussions on labor supply—even though, under German law, higher
entitlement spending eventually tends to trigger higher payroll tax rates to balance the social security system.
See the selected issues paper “Germany: A Long-Run Fiscal Scenario Based on Current Policies.”

The authorities were beginning to collect more information on stocks of assets and (implicit) liabilities, and
officials of the state of Hesse informed the mission that they were preparing a balance sheet for the state, which
they expect to have ready by 2008.

Box 5. A Preliminary and Illustrative Public Sector Balance Sheet
A public sector balance sheet can be a useful indicator of intertemporal health of the public
finances. The balance sheet is intended to reflect all assets and liabilities of the general government. In
addition, the long-run projections of future fiscal balances can be discounted and their net present value
can be entered in the balance sheet to capture implicit liabilities.
A preliminary balance sheet for Germany suggests intertemporal fiscal inconsistency. Combining
the debt already issued with estimates of the net present value of debt to be issued in the future under
current policies provides information on the intertemporal net financial position of the general
government. This approach suggests a negative net worth of the public sector of 324 percent of GDP.
The balance sheet can provide guidance to policy options. By systematically quantifying the future
impact of fiscal and structural measures, the balance sheet can help to show the costs and benefits of
fiscal and structural measures and thus promote transparency.
It can also help to clarify public debate. The public can assess progress toward safeguarding fiscal
solvency if policy options are presented within the time-consistent framework of a balance sheet.
Without such a framework, the confidence boosting effect of economic policies may be lost, because
the benefits would become visible only in the long run. For example the entitlement reforms in
Agenda 2010 have yet to gain public recognition for their large improvement (some 70 percentage
points of GDP) in net worth between 2003 and 2004.

The Hartz IV labor market reforms turned out more expensive than expected.
Instead of lowering costs, additional outlays of about ⅓ percent of GDP are expected.
Means-testing had been deficient and income support turned out to be more costly
than expected.

•

Weakness in employment subject to social security contributions put pressure on
the pension system. Further, the sustainability formula, designed to decouple growth
in pensions from nominal wages as the dependency ratio rises, had been suspended
for 2005—its first year of operation. As wages have been flat, applying the pension
adjustment formula would have resulted in a reduction in nominal pensions,
triggering a safeguard clause in the legislation to prevent such cuts.

•

The 2004 reform had improved health care finances only temporarily. Current
trends suggest a shift back into deficit in the health care programs in the coming
years.

17.
In view of these pressures, the authorities have resorted to one-time financing
measures to meet the constitutionally-mandated golden rule.14 In the pension system, the
government plans to advance the collection of contributions by half a month in 2006, thus
receiving 13 installments next year. In addition, the securitization of future debt service
payments on Russian Paris Club debt owed to Germany provided cash-flow relief in 2004
and 2005, and the securitization of pension receipts in the postal system will reduce financing
needs in 2005 and 2006. Meanwhile, Länder are benefiting from the reimbursement by the
Landesbanken of their interest subsidies, which were prohibited in the context of the
abolition of public guarantees for these banks. Even though most Länder will return a similar
amount of funds to public banks to avoid their decapitalization, these outlays are registered
as an equity injection on market terms below-the-line,15 resulting in one-off receipts of
¼ percent of GDP over two years.
18.
The mission stressed that such one-off policies should be avoided and replaced
by a comprehensive forward-looking fiscal strategy to deal with the structural changes
in the economy. Specifically, the mission recommended early action to bring the structural
fiscal position to balance by 2010 when aging accelerates, and to forestall adverse market
reactions if structural and fiscal problems remained unaddressed. This goal will require
annual structural fiscal measures of at least ½ percent of GDP, a reasonable pace with the
rate of growth at or above potential. Further fiscal measures would be needed beyond 2010 to
keep the fiscal balance in an appropriate range because expenditure pressures will continue to
grow as aging unfolds. Adjustment should focus on high-quality durable expenditure cuts
rather than increases in tax rates, and take advantage of the important synergies between
fiscal reform, recalibrating entitlements, and reforming the labor market.
Durable adjustment and tax reforms
19.
Future adjustment policies need to put priority on spending cuts and expanding
the tax base. The mission noted that there is room for cuts in all three of the main
welfare/entitlement blocs:
•

Households and workers receive generous benefits including housing and commuter
subsidies, tax exemptions for work on Sundays and holidays. These benefits have grown
over time to become an integral part of the welfare state.

•

Corporate welfare is also a burden, with special depreciation rules, loss carryovers,
energy and sectoral subsidies (e.g., in agriculture).

14

Legislation requires the federal cash deficit to be no more than investment spending.

15

In accordance with Eurostat methodology.

- 29 -

These subsidies and tax expenditures for households, workers, and corporations amount to as
much as 6 percent of GDP (as estimated by the Koch-Steinbrück Commission). They need to
be cut drastically but have proven politically resilient.
•

General entitlement benefits also need further cuts. Options here include cuts in long
term care insurance, new steps to limit growth in health care spending, lowering the high
cost of unemployment benefits, and shifting the pensionable age from 65 to 67 years of
age (as had been proposed by the Rürup Commission). Increasing discounts for early
retirement and premia for delayed retirement to improve the actuarial balances, as in
France, should also be considered. Such steps could help limit the adverse effect on
aggregate demand as they would simultaneously improve labor utilization. The
authorities noted that the effective retirement age is going up gradually, including by
increasing the age at which unemployed workers qualify for early retirement. Raising the
statutory retirement age would need to be considered again by the next government.

20.
There was agreement that significant increases in payroll taxes should be
avoided to combat the erosion in full time employment and bolster labor utilization. The
authorities, however, noted that there are differences of view across the political spectrum
about how this should be achieved. Regarding the funding of healthcare, one proposal is to
widen the contribution base by including capital income and contributions from individuals
presently in private health care programs (Bürgerversicherung). An alternative proposal is to
replace the healthcare payroll tax with a lump sum contribution per adult, while using general
revenue to compensate those with low earnings (Gesundheitsprämie). Draft legislation on
any of these proposals will have to wait until after the elections. The election has also
generated a debate about the pros and cons of raising the VAT to finance a reduction in the
unemployment insurance contribution rate.
21.
Corporate income tax reform has moved higher on the policy agenda. Earlier this
year, the government sought a six percentage points cut in the federal corporate income tax
(CIT) rate (bringing the overall rate to 32 percent), financed by reducing corporate
deductions and exemptions. However, political parties did not agree on how to distribute the
burden of offsetting measures and the proposal was not implemented. Noting that Germany
has a high CIT rate but low revenue yield, the mission said that reform would be worthwhile
but emphasized that any cut in tax rates should be fully compensated as fiscal consolidation
needs to be the top priority. Further, tax reform should be framed in a comprehensive way to
avoid further complicating the tax system, with the emphasis on broadening the tax base. The
authorities noted that the Council of Economic Experts has been asked to prepare a CIT
reform proposal by the end of 2005.

Fiscal institutions
22.
Views differed on whether an independent fiscal council could play a useful role
in fostering sound policies. The mission suggested that an annual review by such a council
that reports to parliament could enhance transparency by vetting the government’s policies
from a long term perspective and also help make the case for reforms. Although the
authorities saw merit in these goals, they noted that Germany already enjoys an extensive
outside review of policies, including by the Council of Economic Experts and through twice
yearly consultations on tax projections with a group of renowned economic research
institutes. Therefore, they felt that installing a fiscal council would add to costs while
offering small benefits. Instead, the government intended to update periodically the new
Long-Run Fiscal Sustainability Report to strengthen communication and transparency. The
mission noted that as macroeconomic and budgetary forecasts generated by non-partisan
entities tend to be more accurate than those produced by governments, they could contribute
to the formulation of more realistic budgets and long-range projections. Further, to be
effective the proposed fiscal council should have a formal mandate, democratic legitimacy,
accountability, and clear channels for policy dialogue and communication.
23.
Amending features of Germany’s fiscal federalism will be essential to strengthen
fiscal management and overcome reform gridlock. The authorities concurred that aspects
of the system had outlived their usefulness and needed to be modernized. Reform proposals
had consistently run into difficulty because of the relative ease with which these can be
blocked in the Bundesrat, which is controlled by the Länder, who have diverging interests.16
16

German federalism was designed after the War to provide strong political checks and balances. However,
with the passing of time, it is now recognized to have led to paralysis and is seen as an impediment to policy
reform.

- 31 -

The mission recommended that modernizing the system should be a priority, with emphasis
on the following areas: (i) reducing the number of laws that need the approval of both
chambers of parliament; (ii) creating some leeway for competition between subnational
governments to make tax and expenditure policies more efficient and to encourage fiscal
consolidation; (iii) strengthening the Internal Stability Pact by including clear commitments
of various levels of government, including individual Länder, to help ensure consistency in
the overall policy framework; and (iv) cutting redundancies and aligning better the tasks
among different parts of government to improve fiscal management.17
C. Labor Market Issues
24.
Higher employment growth holds the key to stronger potential output growth.
Disequilibria in labor markets have been persistent, with significant underutilization of labor
(both in persons and hours worked) because of high costs and rigidities. These employment
barriers and high reservation wages induced by the generous welfare system especially affect
elderly workers, women, and those with lower productivity. Valuable progress has been
made to begin tightening unemployment and welfare benefits and improve incentives to work
with the Agenda 2010 reforms, and large enterprises have taken the lead to begin expanding
the average hours worked per week. The challenge now is to improve structural conditions to
boost the creation of jobs and labor demand.
25.
The Hartz IV reforms have boosted labor supply. The authorities noted that the
merger of the open-ended unemployment assistance and social assistance into a new
unemployment benefit (UB-II) program in early 2005 had brought former welfare recipients
into the labor force. Consequently, labor supply rose by nearly half million persons
(1 percent of the labor force), and the unemployment rate jumped by a full percentage point
in the national definition in the first few months of the year (Figure 9).
26.
However, the Hartz IV reforms on their own appear insufficient to yield durable
improvements in the labor market. Although the government’s perseverance in
introducing these reforms is commendable, employment growth has so far been concentrated
in temporary work and the self-employed. High labor costs and labor market rigidities still
hold back demand for full-time employment. In particular, Germany’s tax wedge on labor
income remains among the highest in advanced countries.

27.
Further reforms are needed to revitalize labor demand. The mission called for
policy adjustments in two areas. First, formal wage determination is centralized and responds
insufficiently to local labor market imbalances and productivity differentials. Second, high
reservation wages supported by the generous welfare system for entry level and low skill jobs
prevent adequate job creation, considering that most of the long term unemployed have low
productivity. Reducing central controls on wage bargaining in favor of more firm level
bargaining should therefore be a priority. The mission also recommended loosening
employment protection legislation (EPL) to boost employment by lowering job turnover
costs and reducing labor court involvement, which has become more prominent over time. In
the authorities’ view, however, wage bargaining has already become more flexible because
of widespread “opening clauses,” resulting in large intersectoral pay differentiation.
Moreover, they noted that EPL had been relaxed in 2004, but considered it too early to draw
firm conclusions about its impact.
28.
The UB-II system created by the
Hartz IV reform has the potential to become
an effective welfare-to-work program. The
authorities explained that of the 4.8 million
participants in UB-II, 40 percent were
employed and received “top up benefits” to
raise their income to a social minimum. The
program thus has some features of a negative
income tax and its design now needs to be finetuned to improve incentives to work. High
marginal income taxes for those that qualify for
UB-II are a disincentive to look for work and

need to be reduced. Moreover, it will be important to apply means testing and job search
requirements more firmly. The mission recommended against diluting the reform by
prolonging the duration of unemployment benefit payments for older workers, as such
actions create uncertainty about the government’s resolve. Nevertheless, the duration of
benefits for elderly workers was subsequently extended to limit social hardship.
D. Product and Service Markets, and Trade Policy
29.
Further deregulation in product and services markets will be essential to
facilitate the structural shift from manufacturing to a more service based economy.18
Numerous studies have pointed to supportive interactions between product and services
market reforms and employment growth. Although Germany’s overall regulations rank close
to the EU-15 average (Figure 10), a specific breakdown suggests relatively high barriers and
impediments in administrative product market regulations, liberal services, and for full time
employment.
30.
The authorities reported progress in reforming markets for network industries.
Past difficulties in the energy sector with respect to network access and high electricity prices
are being addressed. An agency with an expanded mandate to supervise electricity grids, gas
and railway networks is scheduled to become operational in August 2005, and has been
charged to devise incentive-compatible pricing mechanisms. Moreover, the postal monopoly
on letters of up to 50 grams will expire in 2006.
31.
Further efforts to lower barriers to entry in the services sector would improve
the climate for running small businesses and boost job creation. The mission noted that
this is especially important for professional services where the restrictiveness index is
substantially higher than the EU-15 average. Opaque rules in administrative regulation, state
control, and barriers to entrepreneurship also create unnecessary costs and impede entry. The
authorities pointed to progress in the areas of craftsmanship and regulated professions,
especially lowering entry barriers and removing master certificate requirements for 53 out of
94 specific activities. They also explained that negotiations on the EU Services Directive
were continuing. Preliminary estimates by an expert working group suggest that Germany’s
highly skilled engineering, construction, and R&D sectors could benefit substantially from
the Directive by generating increased access to other EU markets. At the same time, the
authorities remained concerned that the country-of-origin principle could lead to a “race to
the bottom” for service sector standards. Hence, they were as yet reluctant to endorse this
principle and were seeking adequate safeguards for quality standards and exemptions for key
sectors such as health care. The mission encouraged the authorities to preserve the countryof-origin principle, while limiting exemptions only to the most sensitive areas and for a
transition period.

32.
Regional integration and the lower cost base of the new accession countries have
been prominent in the domestic debate. The authorities said that the public perceives
increased competition from trade liberalization and migration as a threat to domestic
investment and employment. The mission pointed out that it is insufficiently recognized that
integration provides opportunities to exploit comparative advantage to mutual benefit, with
gains from integration that accrue to consumers as well as exporters in the region over time.
If the focus is on protecting current domestic advantage, the accrual of mutual gains will be
thwarted. Meanwhile, Germany has invoked limits on the free migration of labor from the
new accession countries for a transition period.
33.
The authorities support multilateral trade liberalization. In the context of the
Doha round, Germany has backed a reduction in tariffs, liberalization of trade in services,
and a cut in agricultural subsidies.
E. Financial Sector Developments and Policies
34.
Financial sector performance is improving and there has been some progress in
addressing structural weaknesses. The authorities noted that recovery of banking
profitability has continued into 2005, from the trough experienced in 2003 (Figure 11). Costincome ratios are improving, there has been progress in cost cutting, and buoyant financial
markets are boosting income. Bank capitalization is also improving, partly by disposing of
impaired assets, and provisioning has tapered off. The purchase of Germany’s third largest
private bank by an Italian bank is seen as a breakthrough in financial sector restructuring and
a welcome sign of the German authorities’ openness to such cross-border mergers. The
insurance sector is also recording higher earnings and stronger capitalization. The authorities’
stress tests—using the FSAP methodology—have been encouraging for banks and insurance
companies. Although Germany’s moderate growth might trigger some instances of strain
within the financial sector, the probability of systemic risks are judged to be small.
35.
The authorities also pointed to the important steps taken by the Landesbanken
to prepare for the phase out of state guarantees. To mitigate the immediate liquidity
impact, Landesbanken had stepped up their issuance of long term bonds, which qualify for
grandfathering provisions and lock in guarantees until 2015. Moreover, back office and
product development cooperation between the Landesbanken and the Sparkassen (savings
banks) has been intensifying. The number of Sparkassen and Volksbanken (cooperative
banks) is gradually declining. These developments had been recognized by ratings agencies,
as most Landesbanken had secured ratings in the single-A range, while Sparkassen tended to
be rated somewhat higher.

Notwithstanding these developments, the
mission noted that Germany’s banking sector
performance continues to fall short of international
peers. In particular, the banking sector has been one
of the least profitable in the EU. Further, impaired
loans are over 5 percent of total loans, while
unprovisioned (but typically collateralized) impaired
loans remain high at nearly 47 percent of capital
in 2004 (see table below and also Table 4). The
authorities noted that the secondary market for
nonperforming loans has grown rapidly and is
facilitating the cleaning of banks’ balance sheets.

instances, injections of public funds have

shored up capital, and further
consolidation seems necessary. The
authorities agreed further consolidation is likely, but reiterated that fostering regional
competition among public entities was largely a matter of state, rather than federal law.
38.
A more dynamic banking system would be better positioned to support growth.
The mission reiterated the importance of harnessing market signals to guide restructuring,
noting that several Länder still need to adopt legal frameworks that facilitate the mobilization
of private capital, including by transforming public sector banks into joint stock corporations.
Further, dismantling regional barriers to operating public sector banks would help achieve
greater scale economies and diversify risk. The authorities noted that regional barriers had
begun to soften, as the nascent market for collateralized debt obligations allowed regional
banks to diversify credit exposure. Entry of foreign banks in the retail market had also
already instilled more dynamism. In addition, the authorities noted that silent partnerships—
akin to placing subordinated debt—have facilitated, at least in principle, the entry of private
capital into public banks, but agreed with the mission that private funding is still small.
39.
Further steps are needed in the insurance sector, notwithstanding improvements
in profitability and solvency. These improvements are mainly concentrated in the nonlife
sectors, while a key issue in the life sector remains how to combine strong competition in a
fragmented market with the requirement that at least 90 percent of profits be distributed to
policyholders. The mission reiterated that eliminating the mandatory 90:10 profit split would
provide flexibility to replenish reserves during times of duress, and consumer protection
goals could be achieved through other means, including better disclosure requirements. The
authorities elaborated that capitalization in the insurance sector would be sufficient to meet
higher requirements, which will come into effect with the introduction of Solvency II. At that
time, the mandatory profit split could be rescinded.

- 40 -

40.
The authorities noted that the financial sector regulatory framework had been
further enhanced in response to FSAP recommendations. The number of supervisory
staff have been increased and regulation of the reinsurance sector has been enhanced by
bringing solvency requirements, licensing, investment rules, and other key regulations on par
with direct insurance. The mission welcomed these steps, but noted that financial sector
transparency needed to be raised further. Several FSAP recommendations still needed follow
up, including publishing more timely financial soundness data, in particular on impaired
loans. Adopting minimum quantitative criteria for classifying impaired loans will also be
important and the rules for granting and monitoring loans to related parties need to be
strengthened. The authorities plan to address these two issues with the implementation of
new EU regulations, and have also committed to publishing the full set of core financial
soundness indicators by December 2006 building on the good progress in this area in 2005.
41.
There have been noteworthy advances in capital market development. The
authorities explained that the new Pfandbrief law of July 2005 has leveled the playing field
in the mortgage industry, and is expected to foster a competitive mortgage bond market.19
The market for other asset-backed securities and impaired loans is growing quickly, offering
institutions additional instruments to manage their exposures. The creation of real estate
investment trusts has been held up by tax complications, which are being analyzed. Finally,
developments in funded pension schemes such as the second pillar (corporate) and third
pillar (Riester) pensions are also likely to stimulate the German financial system, as they
have done in other countries.
F. Other Issues
42.
AML/CFT legislation has been strengthened, including with ratification of the UN
Convention for the Suppression of Financing of Terrorism (1999). The Third EU AML
Directive is expected to become part of German law by mid-2007. The German Financial
Supervisory Authority (BaFin) is building up its AML/CFT audit unit.
43.
Germany’s statistics are adequate for surveillance. Collecting national accounts
data on inventories and compiling quarterly accounts for the general government would be an
important enhancement. The authorities are participating in the IMF's Coordinated
Compilation Exercise for Financial Soundness Indicators (FSIs); this exercise should produce
the first data and metadata as of end-2005. In July 2005, the authorities received a STA
mission, which is now preparing a ROSC on statistical and data issues.

19

Pfandbriefe are securitized debt obligations underpinned by mortgages or certain other assets. With the
change in the law, all banks are now permitted to issue Pfandbriefe rather than just a limited number of
specialized institutions.

Germany aims to increase official development assistance from 0.3 percent of
GDP in 2003 to 0.5 percent by 2010, depending on economic and fiscal conditions.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
45.
Germany needs a decisive, forward-looking policy strategy to confront the
serious challenges it faces. Adjustment is making the economy more flexible but substantial
policy challenges remain to boost potential growth and secure fiscal sustainability. First, high
labor costs and rigidities have contributed to intolerable unemployment, especially for the
most vulnerable. Second, Germany is at the cusp of a powerful demographic shift and long
run simulation show that public finances and long-standing welfare programs are not
sustainable under current policies. Third, globalization and the expanded EU offer valuable
opportunities and need to be embraced for Germany’s own advantage. Agenda 2010 was a
forceful start in reforming entitlement systems and labor markets, and will yield sizeable and
lasting benefits. However, the unmet challenges require additional steps that include fiscal
consolidation and a reorientation of policies to reduce distortions, especially in the labor
markets. The strategy must be decisive, with firm implementation and a clear explanation of
the policy steps and their timing. Such an approach offers the best prospect for building
confidence and revitalizing growth. And, given Germany’s size and influence, it would also
set a powerful example for other countries in the region and contribute to a reduction of
global imbalances.
46.
Growth is projected to strengthen in the second half of 2005 and in 2006, but it
remains unbalanced and is highly dependent on the external environment. The corporate
sector is adapting to a more competitive world by cutting costs and wage moderation has
been sustained. As a result, competitiveness has improved and exports have been strong. Yet,
exports have been slow to ignite domestic demand as firms and households remain cautious
about spending. An abrupt unwinding of global imbalances and rising oil prices may yet
frustrate the recovery. Revitalizing demand on a sustained basis will require further progress
in addressing Germany’s domestic impediments.
47.
The fiscal deficit is largely structural and long run projections suggest that
current policies are unsustainable. There has been a secular decline in the largest tax base,
wage income, while high and long lasting unemployment benefits and social transfers exert
pressure on expenditure. More fundamentally, the public debt ratio is projected to increase
sharply as aging raises expenditure on pensions and health care. Corrective action is therefore
urgent. Policies need to be realigned with what a declining population can reasonably deliver,
and expectations on output growth and income need to adjust accordingly. Indeed, important
synergies exist between public finances and labor market and social security reform.
48.
In light of the increasing pressure from aging, policies should aim to eliminate
the structural deficit by 2010. This goal requires high quality measures of at least
half percent of GDP a year, with additional efforts after 2010 as aging unfolds. Resorting to
one-off measures such as assets sales or bringing forward future revenue streams to meet the
golden rule does not address the fundamental fiscal problem and should be avoided. The

- 42 -

fiscal strategy should combine three elements: durable expenditure cuts, adjusting
entitlement outlays, and tax reform:
•

There is ample room to cut subsidies and tax expenditures. Even moderate but
durable cuts can add up to significant savings over a long period.

•

Current entitlements are too costly and will exert growing pressure on payroll
taxes if left unaltered. An equitable recalibration of benefits that includes increasing
the retirement age and shifting health care financing away from payrolls can contain
nonwage labor costs and other taxes. This will also help raise employment and
investment.

•

Tax reform should aim at simplifying the tax code and lowering payroll taxes,
possibly with some shift to indirect taxes. However, as the priority should be fiscal
consolidation there is no room for uncompensated tax cuts. Hence, any plans to lower
tax rates should be fully financed with base broadening and cuts in tax expenditures
and subsidies. Piecemeal adjustments should be avoided as they further complicate
the tax system and reduce yield.

49.
Improved transparency and more effective communication about the need for
reforms would help garner public support and strengthen confidence. The government’s
Long-Run Fiscal Sustainability Report is an important innovation but it uses assumptions that
render its findings too optimistic. Appointing an independent fiscal council to prepare an
annual assessment of the public finances for parliament could provide more realistic forward
looking perspectives and better identify policy successes and failures. Also, preparing and
publishing a public sector balance sheet, which shows the net present value of the path of
future deficits, would increase transparency of the intertemporal fiscal position and help
convince the public of the need for reforms and their long run value in strengthening public
sector solvency.
50.
Efforts to reform intergovernmental fiscal relations should be revived to provide
incentives for better fiscal management. The current system has become outdated and is
hampering consolidation. Reforming federal structures is complex but progress can be made
by creating some leeway for competition at the subnational government level to make tax and
expenditure policies more efficient and to encourage consolidation; strengthening the internal
stability pact by including clear commitments of various levels of government; and cutting
redundancies and aligning better the tasks among different parts of government to improve
fiscal management.
51.
Raising labor utilization is critical to mitigate demographic pressure on growth
and public finances. The government’s perseverance in introducing the difficult Hartz IV
reforms is commendable because the new system has improved incentives to work. However,
by themselves these reforms are not sufficient for durable employment growth as high labor
costs still hold back demand for full time employment. To reap the full benefits of the
reform, its implementation needs to be improved by reducing the overlap of functions

- 43 -

between the Labor Office and local governments, and by tightening means testing and the
enforcement of job search requirements. Further, the new UB-II program can become a more
effective welfare-to-work program by improving incentives for participants to increase labor
income while receiving partial benefits.
52.
As more workers are now looking for jobs, greater emphasis needs to be put on
reforms that increase labor demand. Wage determination needs to respond better to labor
market imbalances and more closely reflect productivity differentials, including by
permitting lower wage floors for entry level and low skill jobs. Lowering the wage wedge
and reducing remaining central controls on wage bargaining in favor of more decentralized
and firm level bargaining will also be essential. Moreover, cutting employment protection
legislation would boost participation and employment, in particular for those with little work
experience or skills.
53.
Product and services sector reforms would reinforce labor market reforms by
increasing competition and enhancing productivity. Establishing a business climate that is
more favorable to creating and running small businesses, particularly in the service sector, is
a priority to boost job creation. This will require a further reduction of service regulations
and administrative hurdles in regulated professions and crafts. Germany’s support for an EU
Services Directive that preserves the country-of-origin principle and limits exemptions to the
most sensitive areas for a limited transition period would also serve the country well because
its high skilled engineering, construction, and R&D sectors could gain by obtaining easier
access to EU countries.
54.
Financial sector profitability is recovering, but a more dynamic banking system
would be better able to support growth. Cost cutting, lower provisioning, and favorable
financial market conditions have improved performance. Changes in the public banking
pillar, including intensifying cooperation between Landesbanken and Sparkassen, are
welcome. Landesbanken have shored up their liquidity by raising long term funding prior to
the withdrawal of state guarantees in July 2005, but they still need to develop viable business
models. Although there may be isolated instances of strain, the likelihood of systemic
difficulties is small. Nevertheless, performance of the German financial system tends to lag
EU partners because of the sector’s continued fragmentation, which continues to limit
economies of scale and growth.
55.
Amending the legal framework to support market-based restructuring of the
banking system remains a policy priority. Consolidation within and across the three pillars
of the banking system continues to be hampered by restrictive Länder legislation. Outdated
regional barriers limit risk-pooling and may be unnecessary to protect local banks, which
enjoy an information advantage with regards to local clients. Moreover, opening up public
sector banks to private capital by transforming them into joint-stock companies more
decisively than has been done so far would facilitate market driven restructuring, foster
synergies and returns to scale, and help direct funds more readily to areas of highest
investment needs.

- 44 -

56.
Supervision and regulation have been strengthened, but there is room to
enhance transparency. Supervisory capacity has been reinforced and regulation of the
reinsurance sector has been strengthened. It will also be important to abolish the mandatory
90:10 profit split between insurers and policyholders as envisaged when the EU Solvency II
comes into effect. The transparency of the system would be aided by publishing more timely
financial soundness data, in particular on impaired loans. The liberalization of the Pfandbrief
law should help further advance capital market development.
57.
Germany’s statistics are adequate for surveillance, and its participation in the
IMF’s Coordinated Compilation Exercise for FSIs is welcome. Collecting and publishing
inventory data would facilitate the monitoring of real sector developments.
58.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month
cycle.

APPENDIX I

Germany: Public Debt Sustainability
Under current policies, Germany’s general government debt/GDP ratio is projected to
increase sharply in the long run. Population aging within the context of Germany’s current
entitlement system poses a serious challenge to fiscal sustainability. Aging and its fiscal costs
will accelerate starting in 2010. Until then, the gross debt is projected to increase to
74 percent of GDP. Germany’s projected increase in the old-age dependency ratio
through 2050 is in the upper range of G-7 countries while the entitlement system and labor
market policies tend to offer generous benefits at a cost of relatively low labor utilization.
Although recent pension, health care, and labor market reforms substantially lowered future
implicit liabilities (already included in the projections), they were insufficient to assure fiscal
sustainability.
A long-term fiscal sustainability analysis illustrates these points:
•

Under a baseline scenario of current policies, the debt/GDP ratio would rise sharply
over the projection period 2005-2050. The main factors are a deceleration of GDP
growth (denominator effect) due to a shrinking working-age population, and higher
expenses—and deficits—for the aging dependent population (numerator effect).

•

Alternative scenarios confirm the likelihood of an unsustainable debt trajectory. More
optimistic growth assumptions relative to the baseline (assuming lower
unemployment in the long run and higher labor utilization) are helpful but not
sufficient to contain debt accumulation. Also, a scenario with key variables (growth,
interest rates, and the primary balance) at their recent historical levels; and a scenario
of a constant primary deficit of 0.9 percent of GDP (its value in 2005)—would both
still result in a steadily rising debt ratio.

Thus, under any scenario, structural fiscal adjustment appears necessary to achieve
intertemporal fiscal consistency.
The authorities agree that pressures from population aging are a concern, but differ in
their assessment of the severity and urgency of the problem. The authorities have
published a Long Run Fiscal Sustainability Report that assumes strong up-front fiscal
adjustment combined with higher growth than in the staff baseline scenario (based on lower
unemployment and higher labor utilization). These assumptions imply a lower debt profile
and postpone the moment when the debt starts accelerating, but they do not assure long run
sustainability. The authorities agree, therefore, that further fiscal measures are necessary to
strengthen the public finances over the long run.

1/ Long term projections reflect a staff current-policies baseline with the long run NAIRU at 8 percent of the labor force.
2/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + αε(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; α = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and ε = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ Real GDP growth at 1.5 percent a year; real interest rate at 5.2 percent; and the primary balance at 0.8 percent of GDP (a surplus).
5/ Optimistic staff scenario reflecting a lower steady-state NAIRU of 3.3 percent, and higher average output growth.
6/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.

Since January 1, 1999, Germany has been a member of the European Economic and
Monetary Union; the deutsche mark entered EMU at a value of DM 1.95583 per euro.
Germany is an Article VIII member and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on
payments and transfers for current international transactions, except for reasons related to
security. In accordance with IMF Executive Board Decision No. 144-(52/51), effective
December 2001, the authorities put into effect a series of measures freezing the accounts of
and banning payments in favor of the Taliban, listed terrorists, and persons and organizations
related to terrorism. Pursuant to UN Security Council resolutions and/or EU regulations,
restrictions are imposed on payments and transfers to Iraq, Libya, Zimbabwe, and certain
individuals in the Myanmar. EU sanctions are maintained against the assets of 13 persons
associated with Serbia and Montenegro.

APPENDIX IV

GERMANY: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Germany’s economic and financial statistics are adequate for surveillance purposes. Germany
has a full range of statistical publications and subscribes to the Fund’s Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS). The authorities make substantial use of the Internet to
facilitate on-line access to data and press information.
Germany adopted the European System of Integrated Economic Accounts 1995 (ESA95)
in 1999. In April 2005, revised national accounts statistics were released to comply with
EUROSTAT requirements. With this revision, Germany adopted chain-linked pricing, allocated
financial intermediation services to the users, and introduced new data (e.g. hedonic pricing).
Nonetheless, four significant gaps remain:
•

Statistics on inventories are unavailable. In the national accounts, inventory accumulation is
derived as a residual and lumped together with the statistical discrepancy.

•

Although explanatory documentation exists, the lack of a table bridging the general
government data in the ESA95 classification and the general government cash data on an
administrative basis is viewed as impairing fiscal analysis.

•

Flow-of-funds data for the 1970s and 1980s remain patchy. Also, flow-of-funds data are
published on an annual basis only and with a nine-month lag.

•

The absence of any pre-1970 ESA95 data complicates time series analysis.

As with other euro-area countries, Germany does not publish quarterly general government
revenue, expenditure, and balance on an accrual basis (ESA95). These data, however, are
disseminated quarterly on a cash-basis, although Germany no longer reports cash data for
publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSY).
Following the adoption of the ESA95 standard for fiscal reporting by member countries of the
European Union, the IMF Statistics Department is collaborating with member states, Eurostat,
and the European Central Bank to develop a fiscal data reporting system that accords with the
accrual methodologies of the ESA95 and the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001. The
Government Finance Statistics Yearbook reports annual data for Germany using the framework
of the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001: These data refer to the central government,
state and local government, and the general government (1999-2001).
The 2003 FSAP mission found that the availability and timeliness of financial soundness
indicators were relatively weak. Germany is participating in the Coordinated Compilation
Exercise for financial soundness indicators (FSIs) in which Germany commits to compilation of
a benchmark set of FSIs that will potentially serve as a basis for regular compilation of FSIs.
A ROSC Data Module mission in July 2005 assessed Germany’s data dissemination practices
and the quality of the main macroeconomic datasets.

GERMANY
Staff Report for the 2005 Article IV Consultation
Supplementary Information
Prepared by the European Department
Approved by Michael Deppler and Adnan Mazarei
December 28, 2005
1.
After a close election in September, a “grand coalition” government took office on
November 22, 2005. The government comprises the Christian parties (Christian Democratic
Union and Christian Social Union) and the Social Democratic Party, and is headed by
Mrs. Merkel (CDU). Mr. Müntefering (SPD) is Vice-Chancellor and Minister of Labor and
Social Security.
2.
As envisaged in the staff report for the 2005 Article IV consultation with Germany
(September 20, 2005), a second round of discussions was held with the new authorities and
staff at the Bundesbank.1 This supplement reports on these discussions, which centered
around the coalition agreement issued by government partners on November 12, 2005.2 An
updated staff appraisal based on these discussions is included in this supplement.
I. THE COALITION AGREEMENT
3.
The coalition agreement sets out the major policy objectives for the
government’s four-year term, although in many areas detailed policies and the
interlinkages between various aspects still need to be crystallized. The key economic
elements of the agreement include:
•

Fiscal consolidation: reducing the deficit below the Maastricht criterion in 2007,
with an increase in the VAT rate from 16 to 19 percent in January 2007 as the main
adjustment measure. A package of new expenditure initiatives equivalent to about

1

The discussions took place on December 12-14, 2005 in Berlin and Frankfurt. Meetings were held with
Finance Minister Steinbrück, State Secretary of Finance Mirow, State Secretary of Labor and Social Security
Anzinger, senior representatives at the Chancellery, the Ministries of Finance, Economy, and Labor and Social
Security, parliamentarians from both major parties, and staff at the Bundesbank. The staff team comprised
Mr. Chopra and Mr. Traa. Mr. Bischofberger, Germany’s Executive Director, attended the discussions.

In addition, on October 18, 2005, the authorities provided an updated Notification of Restrictions Under
Executive Board Decision No. 144-(52/51) concerning certain payments restrictions.

-2-

1 percent of GDP distributed over four years (with some backloading) is to provide
support for selected activities. (See Box 1 for additional information.)
•

Labor markets: reducing nonwage labor costs by cutting unemployment insurance
contributions (financed in part by one-third of the receipts from the VAT increase)
and extending the probationary employment period—i.e., with unrestricted dismissal
rights—in new labor contracts from 6 to 24 months.

•

Product and service markets: implementing further reform in network industries;
tightening licensing requirements for some crafts; and renegotiating the EU Services
Directive.

•

Entitlement reforms: increasing the statutory retirement age from 65 to 67 years at a
pace of one month a year starting in 2012; freezing pension benefits for the
foreseeable future; and increasing the pension contribution rate from 19.5 to
19.9 percent effective January 2007.

•

Federalism reforms: reducing complexity and improving political and financial
governance.

•

Financial sector: implementing the Basel II capital adequacy accord “in a
Mittelstand friendly way;” reviewing governance aspects of the Federal Office of
Financial Supervision (BaFin), including “reducing supervisory regulation to an
appropriate level” to facilitate the extension of credit; and enhancing the role of the
National Development Bank (KfW) to support investment and the market for venture
capital.
II. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS

4.
As the government took office only recently, converting the coalition agreement
into an operational implementation plan is still in its early stages. The authorities
observed that the agreement is the result of difficult negotiations between two parties that had
spent 30 years opposing each other in government. Fiscal consolidation is the fundamental
goal and the area where the strategy is most fleshed out; accordingly, this was the focus of
the staff visit. There is also agreement between the coalition partners that the financing of the
health insurance system and corporate income tax regime need major reform, but, given their
complexity, decisions on these two reforms have been scheduled for 2006 and 2007,
respectively. In other structural reform areas, such as labor, product, and service markets,
where the initial plans are modest, the mission’s interlocutors noted that the coalition partners
would need more time to learn how best to work together and make further progress, and
hence the coalition agreement should be viewed as a stepping stone to further initiatives.
A. Fiscal Policy
5.
The coalition agreement articulates specific policies to reduce the fiscal deficit to
below 3 percent of GDP in 2007. The authorities noted that the general government deficit,
which is projected to remain around 3¾ percent of GDP in 2005, had been too high for too

-3-

long. A new budget for 2006 will be presented in February 2006 and will aim to lower the
deficit by about ¼ percent of GDP (in both nominal and structural terms). Moreover, the
authorities will prepare the ground for additional durable adjustment measures totaling at
least ¾ percent of GDP in 2007, centered around the VAT hike on January 1, 2007. The
intention is to continue with further deficit reduction in later years (the precise objectives will
be spelled out in an updated Stability Program to be submitted to the European Commission
in February 2006), but the detailed policies to achieve this were not available at the time of
the discussions. The authorities noted that the grand coalition has broad support in both
chambers of parliament and felt that using this opportunity to make a determined effort to
reduce the fiscal deficit was already strengthening confidence and improving sentiment.

6.
The mission welcomed the authorities’ commitment to reduce the fiscal deficit,
but also expressed reservations about the fiscal consolidation strategy. Specifically:
•

The consolidation effort in 2006 is insufficient and the mission argued that a small
additional effort to achieve structural adjustment of ½ percent of GDP would not
pinch off growth (see section D on the updated macroeconomic outlook). This would
require adjustment of ¼ percentage points more than planned, which could be
achieved by curtailing new expenditures or advancing the VAT increase by three to
six months. In addition to showing more distinct progress in 2006, this would also
allow a more even consolidation path into 2007. The authorities were mindful of the
lumpy adjustment path, but they felt that the expansion was still fragile and that the
planned approach would provide “backwind” to the recovery, thus placing the
economy in a better position to absorb the large deficit reduction in 2007. They also
noted that in any event the new government had been in office too briefly to be able
to prepare and get approval for major adjustment measures for 2006.

-4-

•

The preannounced VAT increase introduces a time inconsistency risk. If the
recovery is seen as too fragile to tolerate a large VAT increase in 2006, the same
could be true in 2007 if the economy does not pick up significantly. Alternatively, if
the economy is strong at the end of 2006, consolidation measures will appear less
necessary and there will be pressure to scale back the VAT increase. The authorities
recognize this risk and intend to contain it by seeking early legislative commitment to
the VAT increase in 2007 (possibly in a by-law to the 2006 budget) to strengthen the
credibility of the adjustment effort. They felt that the coalition could not afford to
reconsider this key measure as the resources were needed in any event to help comply
with the constitutionally-mandated golden rule (discussed in ¶17 of the staff report).
Further, they view the VAT increase as central to the strategy of putting greater
reliance on indirect rather than direct and payroll taxes.

•

The deficit reduction effort puts more emphasis on increases in tax rates as
opposed to durable expenditure cuts. The authorities explained, however, that the
fiscal challenge could not be tackled with expenditure cuts alone. This would imply
cutting pensions and other entitlements for which there was little political support.
Moreover, they pointed out that the adjustment strategy does contain cuts in tax
expenditures and subsidies that will cumulate to 0.6 percent of GDP a year by 2009—
more in these areas was not politically feasible—and that a sizeable decline in
spending on active labor market policies is also underway. The authorities also
stressed that substantial spending associated with reunification limits the fiscal room
for maneuver.

•

The package of new expenditures offsets the other efforts to cut spending and
some elements could become permanent and introduce new distortions. These
distortions include accelerated depreciation for new investment and new subsidies
(via the tax system) for spending on household services. The authorities explained
that the accelerated depreciation rules would be valid only in 2006 and 2007, after
which the planned corporate income tax reform would go into effect and lower
overall distortions.

•

The fiscal strategy includes measures that require counterpart efforts that have
not yet been fully specified. For instance, it is assumed that subnational governments
will save all proceeds from the higher tax revenue transfers following the VAT hike,
without specifying a mechanism to ensure that this takes place. Also, as
unemployment insurance contribution rates are being reduced, the labor office will
need to find offsetting savings to avoid the need for new subsidies. The authorities
deemed the risk of such leakage to be small. Many subnational governments are
suffering from excessive deficits themselves and need the additional revenue transfers
to bring these down. Further, the coalition partners have broad representation in the
Länder, which will strengthen fiscal coordination. Finally, the authorities said that the
labor office had been lowering costs already and improving its performance, and they
will implement new efficiency measures in 2006 to help offset the revenue cuts.

-5-

7.
The authorities recognize that the small deficit reduction planned for 2006 will
have implications under the revised Stability and Growth Pact rules. They pointed,
however, to their concrete plan to bring the deficit into compliance with the Maastricht
criterion in 2007, which they believe sets them apart from other countries with excessive
deficits. At the same time they emphasized that Germany does not want to be seen as the
country that does damage to the revised Pact, and they are engaged in a dialogue with the
European Commission to reach satisfactory understandings. The mission stressed the
importance of accepting the consequences (primarily intensified fiscal surveillance by the
Commission) under the SGP, noting that resistance would have grave implications for the
credibility of both Germany and the Pact. Instead, Germany could exert much-needed
leadership by accepting the consequences of its policy plans, and then overcome these
difficulties in 2007 with the already-agreed deficit reduction package.
B. Structural Issues
8.
Although the emphasis is on fiscal matters, the authorities stressed that the
coalition agreement also makes important headway on structural issues. In some areas,
they felt that the agreement was farther reaching than appreciated by most observers. In other
areas, it sets out principles of understanding, which now needed to be translated into policy
plans. The discussions focused on the following issues:
•

Increasing the retirement age was seen as one of the grand coalition’s major
achievements. This issue had been taboo, but was now accepted to help bring the
pension finances under control and increase labor participation. The mission agreed
that it is an important step, but recommended that its implementation be accelerated
as the 24-year time span to achieve the two year increase was excessively gradual,
especially keeping in mind that the age limit will likely need to be increased further in
the future in line with life expectancy.

•

Coalition discussions on labor market reforms had been particularly difficult. The
main accomplishments in this area will be the reduction in the wage wedge by cutting
contribution rates for unemployment insurance from 6.5 to 4.5 percent, and the
loosening of employment protection legislation by lengthening probation periods for
new labor contracts. In addition, the authorities noted that drawing on the experience
gained under the Hartz IV reforms, improvements in this important program are
underway, notably in the design of the Unemployment Benefit II program.3 The
mission welcomed these initiatives and appreciated that more time may be needed to
bring the coalition partners together on other essential aspects of labor market reform,
especially to revitalize labor demand (see ¶27 and ¶52 of the staff report).

3

A technical error in the design of the UB-II program had caused a sharp increase in the marginal tax rate for
participants who were transitioning from welfare to work. This distortion had significantly weakened the
effectiveness of the program and raised costs as participants did not make the transition. See also ¶28 of the
staff report.

-6-

•

Proposals in product and services markets reforms fall short of what is needed and
in some aspects go in the wrong direction. Specifically, the mission reiterated the
views laid out in the staff report (see ¶29-32 and ¶53), emphasizing the important
complementarities between labor market and product and services market reforms.4
The authorities are still formulating their views on these matters and their immediate
priority is to continue with reforms of network industries, where they see scope to
partially privatize the national railroad and to reform the postal services when its
monopoly status for letter delivery expires in 2007. At the same time, they believe
that adequate licensing requirements are necessary to assure workmanship of high
quality, and that the EU Services Directive as presently formulated raises concerns
about a race to the bottom in labor conditions and quality of service in some areas.

•

The planned federalism reforms focus on reducing the number of laws that require
upper house approval, and clarifying the responsibilities of different levels of
government (such as environmental policy for the federal government and education
policy for the Länder). The mission welcomed these efforts, but noted that they
should be augmented by deeper second stage reforms as outlined in the staff report
(see ¶23 and ¶50). In this second stage, the authorities should seek possibilities for
small revenue surcharges and independent expenditure decisions at the Länder level,
and a strengthening of the Internal Stability Pact (ISP) with quantitative targets for
different levels of government and penalties for noncompliance. The authorities
responded that there was no support for more competitive federalism at this time,
mainly because of the concerns of the poorer Länder. Options to strengthen the ISP,
however, are being discussed but are still at an early stage.

•

The authorities stressed their commitment to reform the health insurance system
and the corporate income tax regime even though these are areas where the
coalition partners had taken opposing positions in the past. The coalition needed more
time to discuss these reforms and develop a common approach. The health care
reform will be formulated in the course of 2006, and a CIT reform is envisaged to go
into effect in 2008. The mission agreed that these reforms are complex and should not
be rushed. It recommended that the health care reform should seek financing models
that do not increase the burden on payrolls (see ¶20 in the staff report), and that the
CIT reform should endeavor to be revenue neutral with base broadening and a
lowering of tax rates (see ¶21).
C. Financial Sector Policies

9.
The mission expressed concern that the financial sector initiatives described in
the coalition agreement could be taken to imply a relaxation of supervision, including
possibly a reduction in the independence of BaFin. This would be ill-advised, not least
4

See also Berger and Danninger (2005), “Labor and Product Market Deregulation: Partial, Sequential, or
Simultaneous Reform?” IMF Working Paper, WP/05/227, which was prepared as background for the Article IV
consultation discussions with Germany.

-7-

because of the high level of impaired loans in the banking system, low overall profitability,
and some isolated signs of stress as evidenced by the recent difficulties in a large mortgage
bank and a real estate investment fund. The authorities explained that it is not their intention
to weaken financial sector supervision or regulation. Rather, the intention is to implement the
objectives in the coalition agreement in a way that strengthens the financial sector and makes
it more efficient. They also reiterated their commitment to the independence and autonomy
of BaFin, but wanted to review its governance structure and learn from the experience gained
in the three and a half years since the agency was established. On Basel II, they noted that
although the potential burden for smaller banks and companies (which in Germany rely on
bank financing to a greater extent than in other countries) is of concern, good progress has
been made by bank federations to develop centralized risk models and that Mittelstand
companies need to accept that they will be rated. They also saw the KfW as a useful
institution with its own niche in the German capital market, and would explore options to
stimulate investment in smaller enterprises, including through the development of a more
active venture capital market.
D. The Updated Macroeconomic Outlook
10.
Lack of clarity about the timing and size of some of the coalition's policy
measures adds uncertainty to the economic outlook. The coalition agreement does not
provide a macroeconomic framework and many of the economic policies are not quantified.
Further, the implementation timetable for some of the policy proposals has not been specified
and the impact of the preannounced VAT increase on consumer and business behavior is
difficult to quantify precisely. Nevertheless, common views are emerging that the fiscal
strategy and structural policy mix will likely be about neutral on growth and inflation in
2006, but will result in a slowing of growth and a temporary uptick in inflation in 2007. (See
Box 2 for the experience with large increases with consumption taxes in Japan and the U.K.)

11.
Economic growth strengthened somewhat in the second half of 2005, and is
expected to continue firming in 2006. However, growth remains unbalanced with the
expansion still largely based on external demand. Investment in machinery and equipment is
picking up, while construction and consumption have remained weak. Overall, the staff
projects output to expand by 1 percent in 2005 and by about 1½ percent in 2006. (These are
headline growth figures; the corresponding figures adjusted for working days are
approximately 0.1-0.2 percentage points higher.)
12.
The projection for 2007 is subject to more uncertainty, with some advance of
consumer purchases likely at end-2006, in anticipation of the VAT hike, followed by a drop
in consumption in the first half of 2007. Spending is expected to begin normalizing in the
second half of 2007. The fiscal impulse is projected to be negative by at least ¾ percent of
GDP. As a result, output growth is likely to slow, to between ¾-1¼ percent. Consumer price
inflation is expected to remain steady at 1¾ percent in 2006, followed by a one-off increase
to about 2½ percent in 2007 because of the VAT hike.5 On these prospects, employment is
not expected to strengthen significantly and unemployment is expected to remain
comparatively high. The staff’s revised outlook is broadly consistent with the views of the
authorities and most other analysts.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
13.
The coalition agreement contains several economic measures and objectives that
are featured in the comprehensive strategy advocated in the main staff report. At the
core is the vital commitment to reduce significantly the fiscal deficit in 2007, while reducing
the cost of employment and shifting some fiscal revenue from direct to indirect taxes. The
planned increase in the statutory pension age and the move toward reforming the federal
fiscal structure are also important steps in the right direction. Many of the details in the
agreement, however, still need to be worked out. Careful and steadfast implementation of
intended policies, in a way that avoids introducing new distortions, will ultimately determine
their success. In this connection, the short delay in implementing the difficult but needed
reforms in the areas of health care financing and the corporate income tax system is
appropriate, and the time should be used to design bold policies that reduce distortions and
are revenue neutral.
14.
The objective of fiscal consolidation by 2007 is welcome but the path to get there
is too backloaded and there are drawbacks related to the composition of the package.
The consolidation planned for 2006 is insufficient. In addition, the deficit reduction strategy
is heavily weighted toward increases in tax rates rather than expenditure cuts, and a deeper
and broader-based approach to reducing tax expenditures and subsidies would be preferable.
The delayed VAT increase also gives rise to time inconsistency concerns. Further, the new
spending initiatives could lead to permanent costs and distortions and are unlikely to be
5

The VAT increase is expected to be reflected only partially in headline inflation because categories subject to
the reduced 7 percent rate are exempted, and with the wage wedge declining slightly, suppliers do not need to
adjust output prices fully with the tax hike.

-9-

effective. To meet the previously recommended target of annual structural adjustment of at
least ½ percent of GDP, adjustment amounting to ¼ percent of GDP would need to be
brought forward from 2007 to 2006. This could be done by curtailing new expenditures and
dropping those that may create new distortions, or bringing forward somewhat the VAT
increase. Cyclical conditions do not preclude this small additional adjustment in 2006.
15.
More generally, the coalition agreement needs to be used as a stepping stone for
much bolder structural reform and continued fiscal consolidation. The policy measures
on labor, product and services reforms are not strong enough to significantly bolster
competition in the economy and strengthen employment and long-run growth. This partial
approach will limit the full benefits of the policy package in the agreement. Every effort
should therefore be made to augment the coalition agreement in these areas to improve
efficiency and take advantage of the critical synergies between labor, product, and services
market reforms and structural fiscal adjustment. Moreover, the fiscal consolidation package
in the agreement should be considered as a first step toward regaining control over public
finances, and policies should aim to eliminate the structural deficit by the turn of the decade
and reduce the public debt-to-GDP ratio. Various welfare programs also need to be put on a
sound intertemporal footing. In the financial sector, the coalition agreement should be
implemented in a way that does not infringe on the independence of BaFin or weaken
prudential oversight.
16.
In sum, although valuable initiatives have been developed, Germany still has
some way to go in framing a cohesive policy strategy to raise economic performance in
a durable way. The staff report offered a vision for such a strategy with mutuallyreinforcing elements. The strategy should be decisive, with firm implementation and a clear
explanation of the policy steps, their quantification, and timing. A good start has been made
in putting together such a framework, but it will need to be augmented and cast in a
quantified long-run outlook that takes account of looming demographic changes. The grand
coalition government offers a unique opportunity to address these challenges with
determination.

Box 1. Key Fiscal Policy Steps of the Coalition Agreement
Many of the measures in the coalition agreement described below have not been fully quantified and
also some (small) components may already be in the fiscal baseline and would not affect the deficit
path in net terms.
Measures to increase revenue:
•
Increase VAT rate in January 2007 from 16 to 19 percent, yielding about 1 percent of GDP.1
•
Cut tax expenditure and subsidies with savings accumulating to 0.6 percent of GDP by 2009.2
•
Increase pension contribution rate in January 2007 from 19.5 to 19.9 percent, yielding about
0.2 percent of GDP.
•
Increase top marginal income tax from 42 to 45 percent for individuals earning over €250,000
or couples earning over €500,000 a year (small yield from 2007).
Measures that reduce revenue:
•
Cut the unemployment contribution rate in January 2007 from 6.5 to 4.5 percent of gross
taxable wages, costing about 0.5 percent of GDP.
•
Eliminate inheritance tax for qualifying small firms (no yield or timing available).
Measures that increase expenditure:
•
Support package to be implemented over four years from 2006 to fund higher R&D spending,
transportation infrastructure, accelerated depreciation for investments in machinery and equipment,
family assistance, and building renovation and household services, totaling about 1.1 percent of
2005 GDP.
Measures to reduce expenditure:
•
Rationalize active labor market programs from 2006.
•
Cut Hartz IV costs through improved design and administration from 2006.
•
Cut pension contributions on behalf of unemployment benefit recipients from 2006.
•
Cuts in public administration and other from 2006.
•
Cut federal subsidies to health insurance funds from 2007.
•
Extend pensionable age from 65 to 67 at a pace of 1 month a year from 2012.
__________________________

1

One percentage point of the VAT increase is earmarked to fund the reduction in unemployment contribution
rates. A similar amount for this purpose is to be obtained through cost cutting in the Federal Labor Office
(cutting active labor market programs and Hartz IV costs).
2
Cuts in tax expenditure will raise revenue; subsidy cuts (the minor part) will lower expenditure.

Box 2. Large Increases in Consumption Taxes – The Experience of Japan and the United Kingdom

In the United Kingdom, the increase in VAT from 15
to 17½ percent in 1991 was part of a broader
reorientation of fiscal policy. The VAT increase helped
finance a decrease in the corporate income tax rate and
the elimination of the “poll” tax. Other fiscal measures in
the budget, together with a privatization program, were
designed to balance the budget over the cycle. In addition
to the fiscal consolidation, there was significant monetary
tightening in 1990 to slow an overheating economy. Thus,
while consumption fell, several factors alongside the VAT
increase contributed to this result. As in Japan, secondround inflation effects were small.

primarily by external demand, and a VAT increase in this
environment could slow the momentum of economic
recovery. Effects of the VAT increase in Germany may, however, be less severe than either the 1997 increase in
Japan or the 1991 increase in the UK because (i) the fiscal shock is smaller than that in Japan in 1997 and it is
not accompanied by the same degree of financial sector difficulties as in Japan; (ii) fiscal multipliers in
Germany have been estimated to be smaller than in Japan; and (iii) even though the European Central Bank
recently raised its policy rate, the extent of ECB cumulative tightening is envisaged to be much lower than the
doubling of interest rates in the UK in 1990. As in Japan and the UK, second round effects on inflation in
Germany are expected to be small, especially with continued high unemployment.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation
with Germany
On January 11, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Germany.1
Background
Economic activity in Germany is slowly picking up, and there is scope for some further firming
of growth in the course of 2006. The recovery, however, remains unbalanced and strong
exports have yet to feed through into higher household spending. Firms invest cautiously,
with some uptick in spending on machinery and equipment. However, structural labor market
weakness, giving rise to slow employment and wage growth, is inducing cautious consumer
spending. While the risks to the outlook are broadly neutral, an unwinding of global
imbalances and higher oil prices could yet provide headwinds for the recovery. On balance,
headline growth is forecast at 1 percent in 2005 and 1.5 percent in 2006, implying a gradual
recovery in working-day-adjusted terms.
On the policy front, the Coalition Agreement that was issued on November 11, 2005, contains
several valuable objectives, such as lowering the fiscal deficit to below the Maastricht
criterion by 2007, increasing gradually the pensionable age, restarting federalism reforms,
and lowering slightly the nonwage labor costs. Nevertheless, domestic markets remain
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive
Board as expressed during the January 11, 2005 Executive Board discussion based on the
staff report.

-2hampered by rigidities, especially the labor, product, and services markets, and the coalition
partners need to use the coalition agreement as a stepping stone to make further progress in
structural reforms. More attention must be paid to improving the structural conditions for labor
demand.
The fiscal deficit is projected to be about 3¾ percent of GDP in 2005, with a small
improvement in 2006. Revenues have been held back by a secular decline in wage income,
Germany’s major tax base, while costs for labor market reforms and pension outlays were
turning out higher than expected, and savings from healthcare reform were somewhat lower
than expected.
The authorities’ stress tests suggest that the likelihood of systemic difficulties in Germany’s
financial system is small, and confirm that the financial sector is recovering from the
weakness experienced in 2003. Nevertheless, there is a continued need for market-driven
restructuring and defragmentation of the banking sector, which has underperformed its EU
peers.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the new German government’s agenda to meet the
challenges of globalization and demographic change. The authorities have appropriately
placed high priority on fiscal consolidation with the articulation of policies to reduce the fiscal
deficit substantially. Directors welcomed the authorities’ perseverance in introducing farreaching and politically difficult labor market reforms in 2005 that have improved incentives to
work, and their plans to make further reforms in the labor market and entitlement programs.
Successive structural changes in these and other areas are bearing fruit, increasing the
economy’s competitiveness and flexibility. At the same time, Directors noted that, despite
growing signs of economic recovery, substantial challenges lie ahead, as trend growth is low
and unemployment remains high. To secure a durable improvement in economic
performance, and better position the German economy to help support global growth,
Directors urged the authorities to build on the initiatives already announced, and implement a
bold, comprehensive, and mutually-reinforcing set of policies to reduce distortions and
structural rigidities and achieve fiscal sustainability over the medium term.
Directors welcomed the signs that output growth is gaining momentum in 2006.
They commended the ongoing business restructuring, cost cutting, and sustained wage
moderation that have helped rebuild competitiveness and underpin strong export growth.
However, the recovery remains overly dependent on external demand. Although there is still
insufficient support from domestic demand, Directors were encouraged that investment in
machinery and equipment is slowly turning up and labor market trends are improving.
To ensure a broad based and sustained recovery, Directors underlined the importance of
following through with a reinforced and clearly communicated medium-term reform strategy.
Directors stressed the importance of actions to address persistent fiscal pressures, and
welcomed the authorities’ articulation of policies to reduce the fiscal deficit below 3 percent of
GDP in 2007. They took note of the authorities’ consolidation strategy implying a lowering of

-3the structural deficit by ¼ percent of GDP in 2006, and their plans aiming toward additional
durable adjustment equivalent to at least ¾ percent of GDP in 2007. They acknowledged the
variety of considerations that have shaped the authorities’ objectives, including the
importance of securing a political consensus to ensure the achievement of their medium-term
fiscal goals, and of avoiding undercutting the still-fragile economic recovery. At the same
time, several Directors considered that a more ambitious frontloading of fiscal adjustment
could have been contemplated. This is especially so in the current circumstances of an
improved economic outlook, as well as the greater popular acceptance of the need to set the
public finances on a firmer footing on which the new government’s fiscal objectives are
founded. A number of Directors, noting the dampening effect of the preannounced VAT
increase on consumption growth, urged the authorities to rely more heavily on expenditure
cuts.
Directors noted that further deficit reduction, coupled with entitlement reform, will be needed
after 2007 to secure sustainable public finances and safeguard the economic basis of the
German social model. They urged the authorities to eliminate the structural deficit by the turn
of the decade, when the costs of an aging population begin to accelerate. This will require a
sustainable deficit reduction strategy focused on expenditure cuts, especially deeper and
broader reductions in subsidies and tax expenditures. Directors welcomed the corporate
income tax reform planned for 2008, but cautioned that it should be revenue-neutral to avoid
compromising fiscal consolidation goals.
Directors underscored that current entitlement programs will exert growing pressure on
payroll taxes if left unaltered. They welcomed the steps taken under Agenda 2010 to start
reforming the entitlement system, and the authorities’ intention to develop plans to strengthen
health care financing in 2006. While commending the authorities’ recent decision to increase
the statutory retirement age by two years, many Directors viewed the planned pace of the
increase as too gradual, and called for its acceleration. Directors saw scope for recalibrating
entitlement benefits further, and encouraged the authorities to pursue additional steps to limit
spending growth on pensions, long-term care insurance, and health care.
Directors supported the planned federal reforms aimed at clarifying the responsibilities of the
various entities and streamlining the process of passing new legislation. They encouraged
the authorities to build on these by introducing greater leeway for competition between states
and strengthening the internal stability pact, thus further facilitating efficiency and fiscal
discipline. Directors welcomed the Government’s Long-Run Fiscal Sustainability Report,
which will help make the public more aware of the need for reform. With regard to the
possible role of a fiscal council, Directors felt that such a function was already served by a
number of well-regarded institutions in Germany, including the Council of Economic Advisors,
the Bundesbank, and research institutes.
Directors emphasized the need to raise the rate of labor utilization to mitigate the impact of a
decline in the working-age population on growth and the public finances, and in that light they
supported the reforms to boost labor supply. They welcomed several recently announced
initiatives—including those to improve the welfare-to-work aspects of the Unemployment
Benefits II program, reduce the tax wedge on labor, and loosen employment protection

-4legislation further—and they looked forward to the effective implementation of these
proposals. To complement these reforms, Directors called for additional steps to promote
greater wage differentiation and thus help increase labor demand, including by reducing
centralized wage bargaining in favor of more decentralized and firm-level bargaining.
Directors encouraged the authorities to proceed more vigorously in deregulating product and
service markets to foster job creation and reinforce labor market reforms. While good
progress has been made in product market reforms over the years, relatively high barriers
and impediments persist in certain areas. Directors recommended a further
reduction—both domestically and in the EU context—of service regulations and
administrative hurdles in regulated professions and crafts.
Directors noted that financial sector soundness continues to improve, with better bank
profitability and a reduction in nonperforming loans, and they agreed that the risk of systemic
difficulty is small. They welcomed the removal of state guarantees in the banking sector and
the intensified cooperation within the public banking pillar. However, the performance of large
German financial institutions still lags behind that of many of their foreign peers. To improve
banking sector soundness and performance further, Directors recommended amending its
legal framework to support market-based restructuring in both the public and private pillars.
Directors commended the authorities for increasing supervisory capacity in and strengthening
the regulation of the reinsurance sector. They took note of the authorities’ commitment to
ensure strong prudential oversight going forward.
Directors welcomed Germany’s commitment to trade liberalization, and called on Germany to
work with European and other partners toward the successful conclusion of the Doha Round.
Directors commended Germany’s intention to increase its official development aid.
Directors considered that Germany’s economic statistics are of high quality. At the same
time, they saw scope for further improvements, including with regard to inventory data.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to start providing a full set of core financial
soundness data.

Statement by Karlheinz Bischofberger, Executive Director for Germany
January 11, 2006

Fiscal Consolidation and Economic Growth – The Government’s Priorities
1.
The new government has put forward an ambitious agenda designed to meet the dual
and closely inter-related objectives of fiscal consolidation and stronger economic growth
with a strong focus to respond to the challenges of globalization and demographic change.
This agenda consolidates, deepens and extends fundamental reforms already implemented
under Agenda 2010, generally in line with longstanding Fund recommendations. The
implementation of the agenda is now facilitated by solid majorities in both chambers of
parliament.
2.
The new government’s reform agenda includes some major political breakthroughs,
such as an agreement on federalism reforms and an increase of the retirement age. The
agenda is well-sequenced with a clear timetable. The phasing of fiscal consolidation reflects
the need to support the recovery while ensuring medium-term fiscal sustainability. Complex
structural reforms such as health care funding and corporate income taxation will be prepared
diligently in 2006 and 2007; there will be no “quick fixes”. The agenda is comprehensive,
stresses the quality of fiscal adjustment, and pays due regard to the complementarities of
growth-enhancing and deficit-reducing reforms. The implementation of this agenda will go a
long way towards safeguarding and strengthening the economic basis of the German social
model.
3.
Germany has improved its competitiveness considerably through continued wage
moderation. Yet, together with high unemployment and necessary measures to contain
growth in entitlement benefits, this has had a dampening effect on real disposable income
growth and has held back private consumption. Furthermore, the long-term economic effects
of German unification must be borne in mind. The annual fiscal transfers to the New Länder
are projected at about 4 percent of GDP. These factors add to the complexity of the reform
task but will not lead to a slow down of the reform process.
Economic Outlook
4.
There is mounting evidence that the economic recovery is taking hold. Exports
continue to expand strongly, reflecting Germany’s high degree of international
competitiveness and brisk foreign demand for its high-quality products. There are also signs
that the pattern of economic growth is becoming more balanced with domestic demand
beginning to catch up. Private investment has gained significant momentum, the construction

-2sector is recovering after years of contraction, and there are clear indications that consumer
confidence is strengthening. Nevertheless, this process has yet to firmly translate into higher
employment and stronger household consumption.
5.
My authorities broadly concur with the staff’s updated macroeconomic outlook. With
the recovery taking hold and the overall fiscal stance turning only slightly tighter in 2006,
household spending is expected to strengthen over the course of the year, also supported by
some additional expenditures being brought forward in anticipation of the VAT increase
planned for 2007. My authorities are confident that the VAT increase will not derail the
economic upswing in 2007, as the recovery will be sufficiently rooted by then. At the same
time, they believe that a more front-loaded consolidation path, as recommend by the staff,
could jeopardize the recovery and, thus, undermine the environment for the fiscal
consolidation strategy.
Fiscal Policy
6.
The fiscal strategy places considerable emphasis on high-quality expenditure
reduction and on broadening the tax base, while acknowledging that tax increases will be
unavoidable if meaningful consolidation is to be reached. One half of the overall deficit
reduction package (€ 138 billion over the period 2006 to 2009) will consist of expenditure
cuts (€ 34 billion) and the abolition of tax exemptions and tax expenditures (€ 33 billion), the
remaining resources stemming from tax increases (€ 71 billion). Indeed, if one bears in mind
that one percentage point of the VAT increase is earmarked to fund the reduction in
unemployment insurance contribution rates, the overall package becomes weighted towards
expenditure cuts and measures to broaden the tax base.
• On the expenditure side, the package includes, inter alia, reductions in entitlements and
stronger means-testing under the new Unemployment Benefit II (UB-II) program,
savings from streamlining active labor market policies and the administration of the
Federal Labor Office, cuts in the federal subsidy of health insurance funds, in the public
sector payroll as well as in funds for regional development and agriculture.
• Measures to broaden the tax base include in particular the abolition of the home owner
subsidy (Eigenheimzulage) and a significant cut of the commuter tax exemption.
• On the income side, the VAT will be raised by three percentage points to 19 percent (still
below EU average) at the beginning of 2007, and the marginal income tax will be
increased for high income earners.
Legislation for the VAT increase will be passed well before its implementation in order to
remove any uncertainties about the fiscal consolidation path and to bolster confidence. The
planned measures conform with the staff recommendations to shift revenue collection
towards indirect taxes combined with entitlement reforms in order to alleviate the pressure on
payroll taxes.
7.
The economic recovery will be supported by a carefully sequenced fiscal
consolidation. In addition to confidence-building effects of the reform policies, tax reform
and a set of specific growth enhancing measures targeted at priority areas will further
strengthen the growth potential:

-3•

•

A fundamental reform of the corporate income tax regime is planned to go into effect in
2008. The reform will be guided by the objectives of making the tax system more
competitive and less prone to allocative distortions and tax avoidance, and reducing the
volatility of tax revenues.
A package amounting to € 25 billion over the next four years includes, inter alia, the
promotion of research and development in order to maintain and strengthen Germany’s
leading position in many innovative technologies, and improved depreciation rules to
stimulate investment in machinery and equipment (until the corporate income tax reform
is introduced in 2008).

Fiscal Framework
8.
My authorities remain firmly committed to the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) and
are fully aware of the critical importance to safeguarding its credibility. The government’s
consolidation strategy is designed to bring the general government deficit below the
Maastricht limit of 3 percent of GDP in 2007. Details of this strategy will be published in the
update of Germany’s Stability Program to be presented next month.
9.
The envisaged federalism reforms mark an important political breakthrough. They
will enhance efficiency by disentangling competencies of the federal government and the
Länder. Also, the Internal Stability Pact will be strengthened by clarifying the respective
responsibilities of the federal government and the Länder governments in the context of the
SGP. Equally important, the reform will make it easier to pass new legislation by limiting
the number of bills to be approved by the upper house of parliament, where the Länder
governments are represented. Streamlining the currently complex financial relations within
the government sector will be another major area which will be addressed later during the
current legislative period.
10.
The staff propose a new fiscal council to review fiscal policy. My authorities are
skeptical that this would create significant value added in the case of Germany. There are
already a number of well-respected non-partisan institutions in Germany, including the
Council of Economic Advisors (Sachverständigenrat), the Bundesbank, and private research
institutes that effectively perform the role of assessing fiscal policy and perspectives.
Labor Market
11.
The labor market reforms of recent years have brought about important changes, in
particular for labor supply. For labor demand to take off, the most important prerequisite now
is stronger economic growth. The policy strategy is threefold: My authorities will make
improvements to existing labor market reforms, introduce additional reforms affecting both
labor supply and demand, and undertake a wide range of measures to promote the growth
potential and to facilitate job creation:
• The UB-II program, which has already led to a considerable increase in labor supply, will
be streamlined and optimized, including through more stringent means testing in order to
further strengthen incentives to work and to combat misuse. The existing “top up

-4-

benefits”, intended to reduce high marginal income taxes for those who qualify for UB-II,
will be streamlined and combined to make them more effective and more akin to a
negative income tax.
Active labor market policies will be cut back significantly and limited to those of proven
effectiveness.
In order to strengthen the competitiveness of labor, the tax wedge will be reduced
significantly, in particular by lowering the unemployment insurance contribution rate by
2 percentage points from the beginning of 2007. This measure will overcompensate a
small increase of the pension contribution rate by 0.4 percentage points, leading to an
overall reduction in non-wage labor costs to below 40 percent.
Tax deductions for household services and home improvements up to a specific limit will
promote job creation in the service sector. At the same time, this will provide an
incentive to transform already existing informal activities in this area into regular
employment which will be subject to social security contributions.
Enhanced financial support for families and increased investment in child-care and allday schools will contribute to higher labor participation, especially among women.

12.
As regards employment protection legislation (EPL), a careful balance needs to be
struck between enhancing flexibility and avoiding an unwarranted rollback of the social
model. Hence, my authorities will continue their gradual approach to reforms in this area.
Building on the EPL deregulation undertaken in 2004, the probationary period for new
employees will be extended from six months to two years. These measures will also
effectively simplify EPL, thereby reducing costly labor court involvement.
13.
The present system of wage bargaining has been very effective in delivering wage
moderation, but further flexibility is desirable to make room for more wage differentiation.
My authorities welcome the increased use of opening clauses and other arrangements agreed
by social partners in order to allow firm-level bargaining, thereby promoting more pay
differentiation under the present system.
Pensions and Health Care
14.
The introduction of a sustainability formula, capping pension growth in line with the
rising dependency ratio, has been an important step towards inter-generational equity and
long-term sustainability of the pension system. Since 2004, pensions have effectively been
declining in real terms. The sustainability formula will now be further strengthened by an
arrangement which offsets expenditure overruns in future years. Such overruns may occur in
years of overall low wage increases as pensions are related to the general wage development
and are not allowed to decline in nominal terms. These measures on the entitlement side will
be complemented by steps to raise the retirement age. In particular, the new government will
gradually raise the statutory retirement age from 65 to 67 years from 2012 onwards, which is
generally in line with staff recommendations.
15.
The recent reform of the health insurance system has led to a significant surplus of
public health care finances of € 4 billion in 2004. For 2005, another financial surplus is
expected. These results have been instrumental in stabilizing health insurance contribution

-5rates, and thus non-wage labor costs. Yet, renewed financial strains are likely to reemerge,
partly because of sunset clauses attached to recent measures. The new government is
committed to further promoting competition, individual responsibility, and costeffectiveness, while preserving the high quality of the German health care system. A
fundamental reform of the health care system will be worked out in 2006, drawing on
available blueprints and best practices. Furthermore, elements of a funded scheme will be
added to the present pay-as-you-go system of long-term care insurance.
Product and Service Markets
16.
Reforms of product and service markets clearly contribute to higher employment
growth. As noted in earlier Article IV staff reports, Germany has a distinguished track record
of steadfast product market liberalization, but further improvements are envisaged:
• A series of measures will be taken, including a “small company act” providing for a
comprehensive cutback in administrative regulation of SMEs and start-up businesses, and
the general application of simplified and expedited planning processes for construction
and infrastructure projects which have already proven their usefulness in the New Länder.
• In the energy sector, the Federal Network Agency’s mandate was expanded in July 2005
to the electricity and gas sectors with a view to improving the market mechanism and
strengthening price incentives.
• As regards the services market in the EU, my authorities are convinced that a wellfunctioning internal services market is of vital importance. At the same time, they
continue to attach great importance to avoiding an erosion of important social and quality
standards. They will work towards an EU Services Directive that meets both objectives.
Financial Sector
17.
The German financial market has performed well during the past year. The DAX
stock market index gained almost 30 percent and profitability in both the banking and
insurance sectors have improved further. The measures implemented during the past years to
improve the institutional framework governing financial markets have thus started to take
effect. The new government will continue this path of swiftly and fully implementing agreed
EU regulations while gradually modernizing remaining national financial sector laws and
regulations. This will ensure that the German financial system becomes even more efficient,
strong and competitive to act as a growth engine for the other sectors of the economy, while
maintaining strong and efficient prudential oversight. In this context, three and a half years
after its inception the governance and the working methods of the German Federal Financial
Supervisory Authority (BaFin) will be reviewed to ensure that the agency has the structure,
including the necessary independence and autonomy, and the means to optimally fulfil its
mission in an evolving environment.
18.
The German banking system is generally well-placed to support the economic
recovery. Profitability and cost-income ratios have further improved. In particular, the
profitability gaps of the big internationally active banks vis-à-vis international competitors
have narrowed as a result of cost-cutting and a tapering-off of provisioning. Impaired loans

-6are on the decline. Regarding international comparisons of impaired loans presented by the
staff, my authorities would like to note that these are subject to considerable caveats due to
diverging definitions. The definition used in Germany for non-performing loans (NPLs) is
relatively broad, resulting in comparatively higher NPL figures.
19.
Financial sector transparency has increased further. A number of additional financial
indicators has been compiled in September 2005. Germany has also committed itself to
providing the IMF with the full set of Core Financial Soundness Indicators for publication in
December 2006. My authorities are currently exploring ways for an appropriate
dissemination of indicators and metadata in accordance with the IMF Compilation Guide on
Financial Soundness Indicators.
20.
The further development of capital markets remains high on the policy agenda. As
noted by the staff, the market for asset-backed securities is growing quickly. The scope for
public-private partnerships will be expanded. The introduction of real estate investment trusts
is being seriously considered. The provision of venture capital will be promoted further. The
conditions for private equity financing will be improved.
Other Issues
21.
My authorities reiterate their firm support for international trade liberalization and
welcome the recent agreement reached in Hong Kong as an important intermediate step
towards a successful conclusion of the Doha Round. They strongly supported the EU offer to
eliminate all forms of agricultural export subsidies and welcome their phasing out by 2013 as
part of an overall Doha Agreement. They look forward to more progress in liberalization of
industrial goods and services, in particular financial services.
22.
While the successful conclusion of the Doha Round and the associated enhanced
trade opportunities have the potential to significantly improve the income situation of poor
countries, ODA remains important for these countries, too. Germany has agreed to increase
its ODA to 0.33 percent of GNI until 2006 and to achieve 0.51 percent of GNI by 2010 as an
intermediate step towards reaching the goal of 0.7 percent of GNI by 2015. The new
government remains committed to these targets, in particular to support low-income
countries in their efforts to reach the Millennium Development Goals. Given the need for
fiscal consolidation, Germany has stressed the importance of innovative financial instruments
for ODA funding.
23.
My authorities appreciate and support the important role of FSAPs and ROSCs in the
context of Fund surveillance. With the recent conclusion of a data ROSC, which will be
published together with the 2005 Article IV papers, Germany will be one of the few Fund
members for which both an FSAP and all Fund-led ROSC modules have been completed and
published.
