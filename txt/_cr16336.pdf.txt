IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with Vanuatu

On October 21, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the 2016 Article IV consultation with Vanuatu.1
Vanuatu’s economy is gradually recovering from the extensive damages caused by Cyclone
Pam, which hit the country in March 2015, and reconstruction efforts have started to yield
positive results. In June 2015, the IMF Board approved a disbursement of about USD23.8
million under the Rapid Credit Facility and the Rapid Financing Instrument. The IMF’s
financial assistance helped Vanuatu cope with its immediate balance of payments needs and
played a key role in catalyzing critical donor support for the recovery.
The cyclone led to a decline in GDP of about 0.8 percent in 2015, relative to pre-cyclone
projections of 3.5 percent. Reconstruction activity and infrastructure investment pushed
inflation up to 2.5 percent in 2015 from about 1 percent in 2014. The current account deficit
widened to 11 percent of GDP in 2015 from an average of 3 percent of GDP in the previous
three years with sharply increased imports and depressed exports due to severe damages to
tourism facilities and agricultural production.
Near-term prospects are favorable but risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside. Real
GDP growth is expected to reach 4 percent in 2016 and 4.5 percent in 2017 driven by the
recovery in tourism and agriculture, and further ramping-up of infrastructure projects. The
risks to this favorable outlook stem mainly from the uncertainty in the rate of
implementation of the public infrastructure projects. The danger of natural disasters is everpresent, aggravated by the cyclical effects of El Niño’s droughts and La Niña’s heavy
rainfall.
In 2016 government spending is projected to increase by 16 percent of GDP, including
unspent cyclone-related grants received in 2015, resulting in a fiscal deficit of about 10

percent of GDP. Major infrastructure projects have recently started or are in the pipeline
under an ambitious infrastructure investment program. These will be partly financed through
external borrowing, raising central government debt sharply to 33.5 percent of GDP in 2016
and higher over the medium term. The government aims to cover the resulting fiscal gap
with additional grant financing, in particular earmarked for public infrastructure projects.
The current account deficit is projected to widen further to around 20 percent of GDP in
2016 due to cyclone-related spending and the high import content of the major infrastructure
projects. This deficit is envisaged to be financed by donor grants and loans, and foreign
direct investment. Foreign reserves stood at USD 273 million (7.1 months of imports) by
end-2015 bolstered by cyclone-related grants and loans from international partners.
The monetary policy stance has been accommodative in an effort to support growth in the
aftermath of Cyclone Pam and the peg to a basket of currencies has served Vanuatu well in
promoting stability and confidence. Inflation is projected to remain below 3 percent in the
medium term owing to low commodity prices, even though expanding domestic demand
will provide some upward pressure. Banks have fully recovered from the cyclone and are
adequately capitalized and liquid. The financial system is sound, but further progress on
financial inclusion is needed especially in the outer islands.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors noted that Vanuatu’s economy is gradually recovering from the
extensive damages caused by Cyclone Pam, and commended the authorities for their
effective response and reconstruction efforts, which are yielding positive results. Directors
noted that growth is expected to rebound in 2016 owing to the recovery of tourism and
agriculture, and the scaling up of public investment. They concurred, however, that risks are
mostly tilted to the downside given uncertainty in the rate of implementation of public
infrastructure projects and the country’s vulnerability to natural disasters.
Directors agreed that the immediate response to Cyclone Pam has been effective in
alleviating human suffering and restoring economic activity. They emphasized, however, the
importance of improving the country’s resilience to natural disasters by building domestic
and external buffers, promoting resilient infrastructure, and establishing more effective
contingency plans.
Directors noted that major infrastructure projects, which have recently started or are in the
pipeline, may challenge debt and fiscal sustainability. They stressed that a careful selection of
investment projects, revenue mobilization, and fiscal discipline are essential to reduce the

pressure on fiscal accounts. Directors commended the authorities for launching a
comprehensive tax reform initiative, including the introduction of a corporate and personal
income tax. They agreed that additional financing should continue to be sought on grant and
concessional terms.
Directors agreed that the financial sector has been recovering well from the adverse impacts
of Cyclone Pam, and that the Reserve Bank of Vanuatu must take action to secure financial
and price stability by gradually normalizing regulatory requirements for banks and nonbanking financial institutions. They welcomed the authorities’ recent initiatives to address
shortcomings regarding anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism
(AML/CFT) and emphasized the need to accelerate the implementation of the AML/CFT
action plan, including by drawing on technical assistance from international partners.
Directors viewed the accommodative monetary stance and the continuation of the exchange
rate peg as appropriate in supporting economic recovery after the cyclone, while ensuring
price and financial stability. They noted that, considering the weak transmission mechanism,
vigilance is needed to check inflation pressures, and ensure monetary policy remains
consistent with the exchange rate peg and reserve cover goals. Directors encouraged the
authorities to enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy by streamlining policy objectives
and instruments and by deepening financial markets.
Directors noted that a concerted effort to promote private sector investment by further
implementing land reforms and enhancing quality upgrading in the tourism and agricultural
sectors are key to ensure poverty is reduced and prosperity shared. They stressed that
improving access to employment opportunities and financial inclusion should remain a
priority to strengthen households’ resilience to external shocks, especially in the outer
islands.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Context. Eighteen months after Cyclone Pam struck Vanuatu, the economy
continues to recover from the cyclone’s extensive damages. Reconstruction efforts
are beginning to yield positive results, allowing increasing use of Port Vila’s
international airport, the reopening of damaged hotels, and the return of tourists to
the islands. These encouraging developments augur well for a full recovery in the
near future.
Outlook and risks. While damage to infrastructure and production was extensive,
the cyclone led to a decline in real GDP estimated at about 0.8 percent in 2015,
relative to pre-cyclone projections of 3.5 percent. The recovery in tourism and
agriculture, combined with further ramping-up of infrastructure projects, is expected
to propel real GDP growth to 4.0 percent in 2016 and 4.5 percent in 2017. Risks to
the outlook are tilted to the downside. The largest uncertainty is the rate of
implementation of public infrastructure projects.
Key policy recommendations:
 Build resilience to environmental shocks by creating fiscal buffers, promoting
disaster-resistant infrastructure, and putting in place simple but effective disasterresponse mechanisms, drawing lessons from Cyclone Pam.
 Implement the government’s development agenda while safeguarding debt and
fiscal sustainability. This will require careful project selection for public
investment, spending discipline (including by state-owned enterprises), and
mobilizing additional revenues (including by introducing an income tax).
 Maintain an accommodative monetary stance, but be ready to tighten if
inflationary pressures emerge. Despite a mild appreciation, the real effective
exchange rate remains broadly in line with fundamentals and the peg should be
kept at its current level.
 Ensure financial stability by gradually normalizing regulatory requirements for the
banking and non-banking financial sectors. Address shortcomings regarding antimoney laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT),
leveraging support from international partners.
 Support private sector investment by further implementation of land reforms and
by promoting quality upgrading in the tourism and agricultural sectors. At the
same time reinforce social and economic inclusion by improving educational
attainment and enhancing access to banking especially in the outer islands.

BACKGROUND: RECOVERING FROM CYCLONE PAM
1.
Vanuatu is a small island developing state and a low-income country recovering
from Cyclone Pam’s devastating damages. Its income per capita is about USD3,000, with
tourism and agriculture the leading drivers of economic activity. Real GDP growth has floundered
since 2010 with the average of the last 5 years declining below 2 percent per year from above 5
percent in the previous 5 years. At end-2015, Vanuatu experienced moderate public debt (25.6
percent of GDP), adequate reserves (7.1 months of imports), low inflation (2.5 percent), and
relatively high private sector credit (around 70 percent of GDP).

2.
Cyclone Pam struck Vanuatu in March 2015, causing damages estimated at around
60 percent of GDP. The extent of the damages appears to exceed that of any natural disaster
experienced in the region in recent memory. In June 2015, the IMF Board approved a
disbursement of about USD11.9 million under the Rapid Credit Facility (RCF, at zero interest rate)
and an equal disbursement under the Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI; IMF Country Report No.
15/149). This financial assistance was intended to help Vanuatu cope with its immediate balance
of payments needs and to catalyze critical donor support for the recovery.
3.
At the same time the country was facing major political challenges which
contributed to slowing down reconstruction. In October 2015, several members of parliament,
including 5 ministers, were accused of bribery (11 were convicted). As a result, 14 seats in the 52member Parliament were vacated and President Lonsdale dissolved the Parliament and called for
early elections. The last Parliamentary elections in January 2016 produced a fractious legislature
with 17 parties.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

VANUATU

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK, AND RISKS
4.
Recent economic developments are marked by the damages of Cyclone Pam, the
political turmoil that ensued, and the recovery process. Real GDP growth is estimated to have
accelerated from 2 percent in 2013 to 2.3 percent in 2014 with the commencement of several
infrastructure investment projects (Figure 1 and Table 1). However, the impact of the cyclone
induced an estimated decline in real GDP of 0.8 percent in 2015. Inflation had been low and
stable prior to the cyclone, dipping below 1 percent due to falling oil prices and service-related
items. Cyclone-induced shortages, reconstruction activity, and infrastructure projects pushed it
up to 2.5 percent in 2015. The current account deficit widened to 11 percent of GDP in 2015 from
an average of 3 percent of GDP in the three years before, with imports increasing sharply on
account of reconstruction efforts and exports depressed due to severe damages to tourism
facilities and agricultural production (Figure 2 and Table 4). The deficit was comfortably financed
by grants, borrowing, and foreign direct investment (FDI). Foreign reserves rose to USD273
million (7.1 months of imports) by end-2015, with reserves excluding Pam-related grants and
loans at about USD215 million (5.6 months of imports). The fiscal balance recorded a surplus of
about 7 percent in 2015 due to cyclone-related grants received that remained unspent during
the fiscal year (Figure 3 and Table 2).
5.
The outlook for Vanuatu is favorable owing to the momentum around
reconstruction activities and infrastructure investments. A recovery in tourism and agriculture
combined with further ramping-up of infrastructure projects is expected to propel real GDP
growth to 4 percent in 2016 and 4.5 percent in 2017 (Table 5). Inflation is projected to remain
below 3 percent in 2017 owing to low commodity prices, even though expanding domestic
demand will provide some upward pressure. The current account deficit is projected to widen to
around 20 percent of GDP in 2016 and 2017 due to cyclone-related spending and the high
import content of the major infrastructure projects. This deficit is envisaged to be financed by
donor grants and loans, and foreign direct investment. Fiscal accounts are likely to record large
deficits (above 10 percent of GDP) in 2016 and 2017 due to the rise in spending related to
reconstruction and infrastructure projects, and the clearing of past due legal commitments.
6.
Risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside with recurring environmental shocks
posing a constant threat. The largest uncertainty is the rate of implementation of public
infrastructure projects, while the pace of the recovery—in particular, in tourism activities and
agriculture—is difficult to predict (Appendix I). The scale and pace of reconstruction efforts may
fall short of needs if external financing is not sufficient or if implementation capacity disappoints.
On the external front, weaker-than-expected growth in emerging and advanced economies
would have a direct impact on Vanuatu’s agricultural sector via weaker commodity prices and a
knock-on effect on tourism via a slowdown in Australia. A persistent appreciation of the vatu
against the Australian dollar—despite an offsetting depreciation against the U.S. dollar—would
reduce the attractiveness of Vanuatu as a tourist destination for Australians and lower the real

Authorities’ Views
7.
The authorities concurred with the staff’s assessment but saw stronger GDP growth
over the medium term. In light of the positive economic momentum generated by the stable
political environment of the last few months, the authorities are expecting a steadfast
implementation of major infrastructure projects. They also noted that spillover effects of the
construction boom to other sectors could further boost real GDP growth over the next few years.

POLICY FRAMEWORK TO SUPPORT RESILIENCE AND
FOSTER GROWTH
Key areas of policy discussion during the Article IV consultation focused on (i) building resilience to
and coping with natural disasters; (ii) scaling up infrastructure investment while preserving fiscal
space and debt sustainability; (iii) maintaining prudent monetary policy and reserve management
along with exchange rate stability; (iv) securing financial stability and improving the financial
system; and (v) ensuring inclusive growth through diversification and quality upgrading.

A. Building Resilience to and Coping with Natural Disasters
8.
Vanuatu is one of the countries in the world most vulnerable to natural disasters.
The 2015 UN World Risk Index, which measures exposure to natural hazards and the capacity to
cope with these events across 171 countries, continues to place Vanuatu at the top of its
ranking.1 Vanuatu’s limited landmass—aggravated by the double insularity of outer islands—and
high population and infrastructure densities in coastal areas, make it particularly prone to natural
disasters. The cumulative impacts of non-extreme but prolonged weather events, such as the El
Niño’s droughts and La Niña’s heavy rainfall put the country further at risk. As a result, Vanuatu’s
key economic sectors are disproportionately affected by extreme weather events.

1

The index relates the exposure to natural hazards (earthquakes, cyclones, floods, droughts, and sea level rise)
with the likelihood of suffering harm from the disaster and the capacity to reduce its immediate negative
consequences (coping capacity) and to establish long-term strategies for societal change (adaptive capacity). See
http://www.worldriskreport.org/ and http://www.uni-stuttgart.de/ireus/Internationales/WorldRiskIndex/.

9.
Natural disasters happen frequently and when they do, they are very costly. The
probability of a natural disaster happening in Vanuatu in any given year is 65 percent and more
than 99 percent in a five-year period. According to EM-DAT,2 which provides estimates of human
and economic costs by type of disaster, natural disasters caused annual damages equivalent to
2.4 percent of GDP over the 1950-2014 period.3 Cyclone Pam caused damages estimated at
around 35 percent of GDP in physical capital and it affected more than 188,000 inhabitants (in
the most affected southern islands, where some 30,000 inhabitants reside, schools and health
centers are still being held in temporary facilities provided by UNICEF). The main productive
sectors were highly affected, with damages to tourism and transport infrastructure estimated at
11 percent of GDP, and production losses in agriculture and tourism equivalent to 10 percent of
GDP.4
10.
Recovery from Cyclone Pam’s extensive damages has been slower than originally
anticipated but reconstruction activities are now picking up steam (Box 1). Although the
immediate response was quite effective in alleviating human suffering and restoring economic
activity, some of the procedures put in place on project proposals were burdensome and delayed
the implementation of key initiatives. Political instability and capacity constraints likely hindered
reconstruction efforts: political unrest limited the disbursement of donors’ grants and, at the
same time, the country’s capacity constraints to manage the post-disaster phase deferred actual
implementation of reconstruction activities.
Staff’s Policy Recommendations
11.
Staff welcomes the authorities’ strong commitment to make disaster readiness
central to their macroeconomic and development agenda. Responding effectively to natural
disaster risk entails different layers of preparedness:


Strengthening risk assessment and planning. Lessons from Cyclone Pam show a need to
improve on the existing disaster-response plan by making it simpler and more agile, and
by establishing a stronger monitoring and evaluation framework. Understanding the
main sources of vulnerability and the potential costs linked to extreme weather events is
a first step in addressing disaster risk.



Building domestic fiscal buffers. Staff recommends incorporating disaster costs into
national budget planning and making the Response Fund, an ex post provision made
when an emergency is declared, a more proactive rather than reactive instrument. The

2

The EM-DAT database covers natural disasters that meet at least one of the following criteria: (i) 10 or more
people reported killed; (ii) 100 or more people reported affected; (iii) a declaration of a state of emergency; or (iv)
a call for international assistance. See http://www.emdat.be/.
3

Staff calculations suggest that the impact on underlying growth is modest, at around 0.12 percent per annum.
Medium-term growth projections of 3 percent (around ¾ percent in per capita terms) reflect this as well as the
positive impact from prospective infrastructure investments. Medium-term spending projections include an
implicit small annual provision for disaster relief.

Estimates are based on Vanuatu’s Post-Disaster Needs Assessment led by the government.

introduction of a corporate and personal income tax is an opportunity to constitute an
additional buffer.


Securing external buffers. The authorities should complement domestic buffers with
externally financed instruments, such as contingent credit lines with multilateral partners.
Also, the existing strong engagement with key donors, whose financial support in the
aftermath of Cyclone Pam had an immediate humanitarian and economic impact, must
continue and be further enhanced.



Promoting resilient infrastructure and adequate maintenance. Although more expensive,
investing in adaptation (either infrastructure such as seawalls, breakwater reefs, that can
withstand stronger weather events; or through relocating key infrastructure and
conducting disaster mapping) can have positive spillovers. Ensuring the maintenance of
critical infrastructure is adequately funded and part of a medium-term expenditure
framework is critical (e.g., stable allocations for the Infrastructure Maintenance Fund, and
including donor support).

Authorities’ Views
12.
The authorities welcomed staff’s detailed assessment of the experience with
Cyclone Pam and stressed that response delays in the early months were in part due to
development partners’ process requirements. Coordinating the support offered by donors
and civil society organizations posed additional managerial challenges, with competing requests,
deadlines, and procedures. Although cumbersome, the authorities acknowledged that some of
the early hurdles faced helped improve the ultimate allocation of funds to more productive uses.
The authorities are committed to simplify and improve the Recovery Plan established in August
2015.
13.
The authorities argued that while enhancing domestic buffers to combat natural
disasters must be a policy priority, in practice it is challenging to implement given other
competing needs. In particular, the authorities highlighted that the funding needed to pursue
their development agenda, notably via infrastructure investments, is likely to make preparedness
to natural disasters a more challenging task. They reiterated the need for external buffers
through continued support by donors and development partners.
14.
The authorities agreed with the need for additional provisions related to
infrastructure maintenance. The budget for operation and maintenance of infrastructure was
increased by Vt200 million in 2016 (0.25 percent of GDP) and an Infrastructure Maintenance Fund
is being set up with an expected budget of Vt1 billion by 2020 (about 1 percent of GDP).

Box 1. Vanuatu: Lessons from Cyclone Pam1
Eighteen months after Cyclone Pam struck Vanuatu, the economy continues to recover from the cyclone’s extensive
damages. With the benefit of hindsight, we draw some lessons from the experience.
Institutions
Although the immediate response was effective, the recovery and reconstruction plan was overly complex
with some coordination issues with development partners. Since 2013, Vanuatu has a Ministry dealing
exclusively with climate change issues, which houses the National Disaster Management Office (NDMO) in charge
of coordinating preparedness and recovery initiatives. Thanks to a cluster system in place (spanning water and
sanitation, education, agriculture, to name a few) the immediate response was quite effective in alleviating human
suffering, ensuring the population’s access to food items and shelters. The medium- to long-term recovery is
coordinated by the Prime Minister’s Office. The government established a Recovery Committee in August 2015 to
coordinate reconstruction efforts. Composed by high-level officials, the committee in charge of reviewing project
proposals and allocating funds lacked a dedicated technical unit. Some of the procedures put in place were
burdensome and delayed the implementation of key initiatives even if these might have improved the ultimate
allocation of funds.2

Fiscal buffers
Fiscal buffers were very limited. The authorities had established two domestic financing mechanisms in response
to natural disasters. Managed by the Ministry of Finance, the Emergency Fund has an allocation of Vt25 million
(about USD230,000) and the Response Fund can provide up to 1.5 percent of the government’s budget for that
particular fiscal year (about USD2.5 million or 0.3 percent of GDP). The government spent in total Vt390 million
with Pam-related relief and recovery in 2015 (about USD3.6 million or 0.5 percent of GDP), with additional
resources diverted from other priority programs. The Response Fund, which is only triggered in case of a major
natural disaster, cannot adequately facilitate the large needs from such an extreme event. Given the frequent
recurrence of environmental events in Vanuatu, the authorities could consider establishing a preemptive fund that
would reduce the fiscal pressures from higher frequency and lower intensity events, for example, by providing
funding for resilient infrastructure and adaptation activities.
Response

Low

Donor financing
Financial assistance, in particular from bilateral partners, was swift and sizeable though disbursements are
low. In the aftermath of Cyclone Pam, development partners contributed significant amounts of aid-in-kind,
grants, and loans for immediate support and medium-term reconstruction-related projects. The IMF’s financial
assistance via RCF/RFI of about USD23.8 million for balance of payments needs played a key role in catalyzing
critical donor support and was the first to be disbursed among IFIs. The World Bank committed USD50 million and
the Asian Development Bank USD22 million for the reconstruction of roads, schools, and public buildings. At the
bilateral level, the more significant contributions were AUD15 million for immediate response and AUD35 for
recovery from Australia, NZD3.5 million for immediate response and NZD6 million for recovery from New Zealand,
and EUR10.5 million from the E.U. While about USD72 million in grants were received in 2015 and disbursements
are picking up in 2016, absorption capacity is being stretched.

Insurance
Although timely, insurance was not sufficient to cover major disasters. Vanuatu received USD1.9 million from
the Pacific Catastrophe Risk and Financial Insurance (PCRFI). While the authorities acknowledged the fast
disbursement, the payout was insignificant (covering less than 1 percent of damages) for meeting the needs
resulting from Cyclone Pam. Private sector insurance, primarily available to large and established businesses
(resorts, in particular) and in urban areas, covered Vt5.7 billion of Pam-related damages (or about USD52 million).
Despite the adequate payout, there is a risk that insurance premia may rise in the future.

Social safety net
The authorities’ response supported households’ reconstruction needs. The government suspended VAT and
import duties on construction materials for two months after the cyclone, deferred the payments of vehicle
registration fees and VAT payments to the next quarter, and provided subsidies for agricultural seedlings to
affected households. The Vanuatu National Provident Fund (VNPF) allowed its 40,000 active members (mostly civil
servants) to withdraw up to 20 percent of their retirement savings to cover expenses related to Cyclone Pam, with
total withdrawals amounting to Vt1.7 billion (2.1 percent of GDP) for three months following the disaster. The
VNPF was able to withdraw Vt2.1 billion in the domestic banking sector to fund its members’ needs, with limited
financial impact on its books. While the most considerable damages were recorded in the southern islands of
Vanuatu, most VNPF members are located in the three major (and less affected) islands—limiting the reach of the
policy.

Monetary policy
The RBV’s comfortable level of reserves helped alleviate liquidity constraints. The RBV’s policy helped
smooth the impact of Cyclone Pam with measures facilitating the financial sector’s access to liquidity and
supporting the government’s rehabilitation efforts. The RBV took swift action and agreed to tie its policy rate to
the 91-day RBV Note (variable) rate, which implied a decrease from 5.25 percent to about 1.85 percent, and to
reduce the Statutory Reserve Deposit (SRD) requirement, which comprises reserve deposits of commercial banks
held as reserves at the RBV, from 7 to 5 percent. Additional measures were taken, including the activation of an
additional credit facility for commercial banks, an interest rate decrease on the RBV’s Secured Advance Facility and
the inclusion of SRD holdings as eligible collateral as well as the provision of financial assistance relief of Vt40
million to the government and provinces.

Banks fostered the continuity of the payments system with well-targeted business continuity plans. Banks
implemented their business continuity plan to ensure most households and businesses had enough physical
currency to proceed with their daily activities when banks were closed, ATM machines were down, and the only
means of payment available was notes and coins. The largest food and petrol retailers were visited twice daily to
facilitate cash holdings and deposits. A few days after the cyclone hit, banks provided an immediate waiver on
their retail customers’ loan repayments for 2 to 3 months. Banks also delayed loan repayments for 6 to 12 months
to some corporate customers pending an insurance payout and provided additional lending to commence repair

Early warning systems were instrumental. The authorities sent early warning messages through radio and

percent of the service was restored after 4 weeks in Efate island and after 8 weeks in Tanna island). Damages were
assumed by the government but the pass-through to consumers was limited (electricity prices are regulated by
the government and updated monthly). The price of fuel dropped Vt10 per liter on all products a month after the

B. Scaling Up Infrastructure Investment while Preserving Fiscal Space
and Debt Sustainability
15.
In 2015, the government budget recorded an unexpectedly large surplus of 7.2
percent of GDP due to unspent cyclone-related grants received from the international
community. In addition, duties’ collection improved considerably thanks to increased imports.
As a result, domestic revenue was stable, broadly unaffected by the government’s decision to
suspend VAT on construction materials in the aftermath of Cyclone Pam. Government expenses
rose to 23.6 percent of GDP due to immediate relief needs and early election expenses (Table 2).
Capacity constraints and political uncertainties kept reconstruction spending and public
investment low in 2015.
16.
However, in 2016, the fiscal balance is projected to record deficits of about 10
percent of GDP due to large cyclone-related current and capital spending, and overdue
severance payments. The government expects domestic revenue to increase by 2.3 percent
compared to the 2015 budget (19.2 percent of GDP), supported by receipts from the Citizenship
Program and the recently established Vanuatu Economic Rehabilitation Program (launched in
late 2015). Non-donor-related expenses were initially projected at 19.2 percent of GDP, as
provisions for Cyclone Pam’s recovery activities were accounted for. However, a supplementary
budget of 1.6 percent of GDP was passed in July to fulfill part of the overdue severance
payments to civil servants (2.6 percent of GDP). Capital expenditure is projected to rise sharply

starting this year on account of the country’s ambitious infrastructure scale up. Although much of
the spending is financed by grants, external concessional loans, and deposits, long-term
domestic bonds (1.4 percent of GDP) were issued to close the financing gap.

was raised by 18.2 percent from end-2015 level. The RBV’s recent purchase of a Vt1.1 billion 10
year-maturity bond has pushed its credit to the government to the limit. While the new external
debt is highly concessional, repayment obligations may put pressure on fiscal accounts as debt
service is projected to reach USD18 million by 2020.

19.
An updated Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) suggests that Vanuatu continues to
face a moderate risk of debt distress, a move-up from the low rating in 2013 due to postCyclone Pam reconstruction and planned infrastructure projects. While the evolution of debt
indicators remains similar to that obtained in the 2015 DSA, the sizeable infrastructure projects
pose threats to debt and fiscal sustainability when grants and concessional financing are delayed
or become insufficient to cover the investment program. A model-based analysis reaffirms the
need for a concerted effort with the private sector and international financial institutions to more
clearly advocate for careful selection of projects and the need to develop contingency plans in
case expected returns do not materialize, and that financing at concessional terms—in particular
through grants—is available (Appendix III). In addition, another extreme weather event in the
medium term is likely to raise the country’s risk of debt distress, which further reinforces the
need to rely on grant financing. Repeated large-scale borrowing to rebuild from disasters is not a
viable long-term strategy and more emphasis is needed on risk reduction investments.

Major infrastructure projects, including the building of international wharfs and

of the country’s 2015 GDP spread over the next 7 years, with the bulk of the construction to be
undertaken during the 2016-18 period. Five major infrastructure projects started and will be
implemented over the next few years. In addition, agreements have been signed with the Asian
Development Bank and the World Bank to finance, through grants and loans, the reconstruction
of schools and roads damaged by Cyclone Pam.

personal and corporate income tax by 2018, which
would generate additional revenue of about 1 percent of GDP. A Tax Review Committee,
supported by a AusAid-funded resident tax advisor, was formed within the Ministry of Economic
Development and Finance and is expected to start the consultation process with the public soon.

21.
Government Business Enterprises (GBEs) continue to operate under unclear
regulatory framework raising concerns for their transparency and effectiveness. They
represent a significant ongoing fiscal cost to the government including by adding burden to
public debt––government-guaranteed GBE debt amounted to 4.6 percent of GDP at the end of
2015). In comparison with other small island economies the performance of Vanuatu GBEs does
not fare well (Appendix V). The authorities are working closely with ADB to assess their financial
situation and to improve governance.
Staff’s Policy Recommendations
22.
Staff welcomes the authorities’ tax reform initiatives, which are expected to raise
tax revenue, but securing debt sustainability will require efforts in several respects:


Slowing down debt accumulation. With public debt ratios rising sharply in the next few
years, staff urges the authorities to exercise restraint in contracting additional borrowing
in the near future, which would risk debt distress. Therefore, a clear policy priority for the
authorities is to set the debt-to-GDP ratios on a declining path by 2021 and seek grant
financing for the majority of any additional development projects. Staff sees the need for
a concerted effort with the private sector and international financial institutions to ensure
the public investment program yields the expected returns and that financing at
concessional terms—in particular through grants—is available.



Exercising fiscal discipline. Fiscal pressures are compounded by reconstruction efforts and
the authorities’ ambitious infrastructure investment agenda. At this critical juncture,
prudent fiscal policy is key to Vanuatu’s fiscal sustainability and macro stability. To reduce
the need for supplementary budgets and more borrowing, it is important to reprioritize
expenditure and seek synergies between pre-planned infrastructure projects and

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

VANUATU

reconstruction activities. It is also important to incorporate the cost of maintenance in the
recurrent budget to minimize public infrastructure depreciation.


Implementing the tax reform in a timely and orderly manner. Staff commends the
authorities for launching a review of the tax system in 2016. Nonetheless, caution should
be exercised in the planning and implementation stages of the tax reform to ensure the
public and the tax administration are fully prepared to secure the expected revenue
returns and fairness of the system. Close collaboration with the Fund’s tax policy and
administration experts is highly recommended.



Reforming GBEs. The GBEs play an important role in the economy and improving their
efficiency would help safeguard fiscal sustainability and reduce the risk of contingent
liabilities. In this context, staff welcomes the authorities’ plan to submit the GBE law to
Parliament as its adoption would help improve fiscal discipline, accountability, and the
financial viability of GBEs.

Authorities’ Views
23.
The authorities recognized that the ambitious development plan and reform
agenda may cause pressure on debt sustainability. While they view the “big push” in
infrastructure investment as a necessary element of Vanuatu’s development strategy, they are
also mindful of the risks involved, including to debt sustainability. They conveyed their intention
to seek financing at concessional terms for new projects—in particular through grants.
24.
The authorities concurred with the mission’s recommendations for further fiscal
discipline. Given the current juncture of reconstruction efforts along with the scaling up of public
investment, the authorities agreed that prudent fiscal policy should be a priority to ensure ample
fiscal space and macroeconomic stability. They indicated that reducing the need for
supplementary budgets and other unplanned expenditure will be an important fiscal objective.
25.
The authorities expressed their strong commitment to push ahead with
comprehensive tax reforms starting with the introduction of income tax by early 2018. The
authorities emphasized the need to ensure that the reforms result in a tax system that is effective
(yielding sizable additional revenues) but also socially fair especially to the poor. The authorities
requested Fund’s technical assistance (TA) on policy and legislation and providing guidance in
the implementation stage of the reforms.

C. Maintaining Prudent Monetary Policy and Reserve Management,
along with Exchange Rate Stability
26.
The accommodative monetary policy remains appropriate in an effort to support
economic recovery and financial stability after the cyclone. In the aftermath of the cyclone,
the RBV moved swiftly to support economic recovery and financial stability by lowering its policy
rate to be tied to the RBV’s 91-day bill rate, reducing the required reserve ratio, and activating
the RBV’s credit facilities. However, the monetary policy transmission mechanism in Vanuatu

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

VANUATU

remains obscure owning to unclear monetary policy objectives and inconsistencies in the use of
monetary policy instruments as well as shallow financial markets (Appendix VI). In addition, credit
provision to the business sector remains limited in spite of sufficient liquidity in the financial
sector. This is partly due to the large uncertainty around business prospects and stringent
collateral requirements.

To make the monetary policy transmission mechanism more effective, staff
encourages the RBV to clarify further its monetary policy objectives and instruments. Staff
also encourages the RBV to maintain a conservative approach to reserve management as foreign
reserves will be needed to provide foreign currency for debt repayment. It is therefore important
to maintain foreign reserves at above 4 months of imports to provide a necessary buffer against
external shocks.

Dissonant bilateral nominal exchange rate fluctuations have contributed to a mild real effective exchange
rate (REER) appreciation. Over the recent period, the diverging paths between Vanuatu’s major trading partners’
currencies—the Australian dollar (AUD) and the U.S. dollar (USD)—have contributed to the vatu’s appreciation
against the AUD and depreciation against the USD (both around 20 percent since 2013), most of which

differentials with main trading partners).

Vanuatu has been running moderately high current account deficits, yet reserves remain at an adequate
level. Current account imbalances are likely to persist (well above 10 percent of GDP over the medium term) given
post-cyclone reconstruction needs, the high import-content of the major infrastructure projects, and a piecemeal
recovery of tourism receipts—with the external deficit being predominantly financed by external grants,
concessional borrowing, and FDI which is expected to remain at high levels in the medium term due to postcyclone reconstruction activities and infrastructure projects. International reserves, which support the currency
peg, have recently experienced a significant boost and should remain adequately above five months of imports
over the medium term.
Vanuatu enjoys a lower cost of doing business relative to its neighbors and other small developing states
but there is ample room for improvement to boost competitiveness. Vanuatu ranked 94 (of 189) in the WB’s
Ease of Doing Business index, below only two other Pacific Island countries. However, the country lags in several
key aspects: (i) time and cost of starting a business; (ii) cost of dealing with construction permits; and (iii) enforcing
contracts. Land titling was repeatedly referred to as a major hurdle by the private sector. Structural reforms to
remove these bottlenecks and to stimulate investment should be considered, in particular if Vanuatu wants to
expand its production of beef and other agricultural products.
Staff’s exchange rate assessments suggest that the external position is broadly consistent with
fundamentals and desirable policy settings. The External Balance Assessment (EBA-lite) suggests a real
overvaluation ranging from 6.7 to 7.9 percent, highlighting

Staff recommends maintaining the peg at its current level. Despite a mild real
appreciation in the aftermath of Cyclone Pam, the peg to an undisclosed basket of currencies
continues to serve Vanuatu well in promoting stability and confidence. In the future, the
authorities should nonetheless be ready to adjust the level and composition of the peg if
Vanuatu’s external position worsens significantly.
Authorities’ Views
31.
The authorities concurred with the staff’s assessment on the monetary policy
transmission mechanism and on the need to develop policy tools to improve it. The
authorities noted that capacity constraints and shallow financial markets were restricting their
monetary policy options. The authorities agreed to maintain accommodative monetary policy,
but stand ready to tighten should inflationary pressures emerge.
32.
The authorities agreed with the staff’s external balance assessment and on the need
to maintain sufficient reserves to face future commitments. Despite concerns over the recent
Australian dollar fluctuations, the authorities intend to maintain the current peg and consult with
the IMF on any changes. If deemed necessary by new developments in the economy, the
authorities will reassess its level to ensure external stability over the medium term.

in the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) gray list in February 2016 after the authorities agreed
to an action plan to address significant AML/CFT deficiencies. Several measures, including
amendments to the legal framework on AML/CFT and the international companies sector are
being pursued. Though the loss of correspondent banking relationships (CBRs) has not emerged
as a serious issue in Vanuatu, the inclusion in the FATF list and the selloff of Westpac (Australian
bank) to PNG’s Bank South Pacific in July 2016 may pose some difficulties in cross-border
payments, trade finance, and remittances. The cost of transferring funds to Vanuatu has been
trending up since 2014 and is substantially higher than in other PICs.

Staff’s Policy Recommendations
36.
The RBV must take action to secure financial stability by gradually normalizing
regulatory requirements for the banking and non-bank financial sectors. First, the RBV
needs to undertake a diagnostic assessment of banks’ financial situation to be prepared for the
risks stemming from potential tightening of reserve and liquid asset requirements. Staff also
recommends PFTAC’s assistance in reviewing a current credit union act and drafting the
amendments to ensure the effectiveness of supervision on credit unions and to promote credit
unions’ role in financial inclusion.

5

According to staff analysis, large interest rate spreads, which are commonly observed in PICs, result from high
cost and high risk of credit potentially arising from small scale, vulnerability to shocks, and geographic dispersion
in the region (Jamaludin, Klyuev, and Serechetapongse, IMF WP/15/96).

37.
Staff welcomes the authorities’ recent initiatives to resolve the AML/CFT issue and
encourage them to seek further international support. Vanuatu needs to accelerate the
implementation of the AML/CFT action plan and ensure its legal framework is in line with
international standards (e.g., secrecy obligations, bearer shares and share warrants, and
transparency of beneficial ownership information of offshore companies and trusts).6 Several
partners have expressed interest in supporting the authorities on this issue. Benefiting from
Papua New Guinea and Australia’s collaboration, the authorities should leverage this support to
make bold steps to ensure its exit from the FATF monitoring.
Authorities’ Views
38.
The authorities emphasized that the RBV’s prompt policy response after the
cyclone significantly enhanced overall bank liquidity in the domestic financial system. They
further acknowledged that caution is needed to ensure financial stability with the tightening of
reserve and liquid asset requirements when deemed appropriate.
39.
The authorities are proceeding with AML regulations and expect a steady
implementation of the action plan put in place in line with international standards. In
addition to FATF and the Asia-Pacific Group support, the authorities are engaging with other
development partners for technical and legal support, and are committed to enhancing the
overall effectiveness of the AML/CFT regime.

E. Ensuring Inclusive Growth through Diversification and Quality
Upgrading
40.
Vanuatu’s ongoing development
strategy pays particular attention to
poverty and inclusion. A recent study by
the World Bank7 finds that poverty is
widespread in most Pacific islands with
many households living in deprived
conditions. To eliminate absolute poverty
and achieve shared prosperity in Vanuatu,
in accordance with Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs) 1 and 2, three
key conditions must be in place: higher
growth, employment and financial services,
and a resilient social safety net against
external shocks.

SDGs on poverty and respective targets
Goal 1. End poverty in all its forms everywhere
T1.5. By 2030, build the resilience of the poor and those in
vulnerable situations and reduce their exposure and vulnerability to
climate-related extreme events and other economic, social and
environmental shocks and disasters.
Goal 2. End hunger, achieve food security and improved
nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture
T2.4. By 2030, ensure sustainable food production systems and
implement resilient agricultural practices that increase productivity
and production, that help maintain ecosystems, that strengthen
capacity for adaptation to climate change, extreme weather, drought,
flooding and other disasters and that progressively improve land and
soil quality.

Sustainable Development.”

41.
Improving access to employment opportunities and to basic social services is a
priority, especially in the outer islands. Enhancing the educational attainment and skills of the
poor deserve particular emphasis (Table 7). The ability to access external labor markets is a
window of opportunity for poverty reduction and inclusion. Several PICs, including Vanuatu, have
had labor mobility agreements with Australia, New Zealand, or the United States. Expanding
these agreements will prove critical in addressing the country’s unemployment challenges.
Seasonal workers in Australia and New Zealand have increased, raising their living standards and
those of their families at home. However, workers could be marketed more effectively and their
skills enhanced with appropriate training policies. A recent study by the World Bank is assessing
potential benefits for Vanuatu and other PICs from modifying existing labor migration policies by
both sending and receiving countries (Appendix VII).
42.
The authorities are making efforts to promote financial inclusion, but meeting
lending needs by many small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) remains challenging.
The National Bank of Vanuatu (NBV), the only domestic bank in Vanuatu, has played an
important role in providing financial services to the outer islands, including via microfinance and
financial literacy education programs. NBV recorded a 35 percent growth of microfinance lending
in 2015 after introducing the Rural Land and Seasonal Labour Loans to rural residents and
seasonal workers. The financial literacy education program was also very successful in helping
open bank accounts in rural areas. Credit unions have played a complementary role in providing
financial services to rural residents unable to access banking services. Nonetheless, many SMEs
still find it challenging to obtain credit because of stringent collateral requirements, suggesting
that there exists ample room for further financial development (Figure 5).
43.
Quality upgrading and diversification are expected to play a critical role in
promoting inclusive growth. Improvements in connectivity—thanks to the recently completed
submarine cable connection, planned investments in transport infrastructure, and lower fuel
prices—are attracting more and higher quality tourism. Exploring niche markets and tapping on
Vanuatu’s agricultural resources as in input for the tourism industry—agrotourism—will be
beneficial for poverty reduction and inclusion. Efforts to increase agricultural production,
including beef production, provide diversification in domestic activities that can serve the
economy well and provide an additional buffer against external shocks.8
44.
Improving the ease of doing business is an important complement in promoting
quality upgrading and diversification. Enhanced competition would help address the high cost
of doing business in Vanuatu that hinders entry into new lines of economic activity, which in turn
limits opportunities for quality upgrading and productivity boosts. There is room to improve the
country’s standing on the ease of starting a business, registering property, or land titling.9 The

Transformation and Diversification,” (IMF, March 2014).

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

VANUATU

recent reforms to the leasing regime for customary land have caused unexpected delays in the
process of registering land due to some inefficient procedures aimed at improving transparency.
Staff’s Policy Recommendations
45.
Staff encourages the authorities’ efforts to bolster inclusive growth and emphasizes
the following:


Poverty alleviation. Particular emphasis should be placed on preparing the vulnerable
populations for the recurrence of climatic events. The authorities’ commitment to
incorporate these efforts in the new medium-term development strategy is very
welcome.



Financial inclusion. Staff analytical work
shows a strong link between financial
deepening and growth. Therefore,
increasing private access to finance should
continue to be an important priority in
Vanuatu’s development strategy. At the
same time, the authorities need to secure
the soundness of non-bank financial
institutions, which play a crucial role in
promoting financial inclusion especially in
the outer islands.

Quality upgrading. Staff commends the authorities’ efforts to improve quality upgrading
in the agricultural sector, which accounts for about 70 percent of the labor force. New
initiatives by bilateral and multilateral donors to expand opportunities in the agricultural
sector is an encouraging step towards this direction.

Authorities’ Views
46.
The authorities agreed with staff’s view on the importance of financial inclusion for
the long-term development of the country. They expressed their intention to continue their
efforts in promoting access to financial services in rural areas.
47.
The authorities concurred with the staff’s recommendations on poverty reduction,
diversification, and quality upgrading. They noted ongoing efforts to introduce structural
competitiveness measures to reduce the cost of doing business in Vanuatu. The authorities
reinforced the intention of promoting more economic activities in the outer islands, with a
particular focus on agricultural production supported by development partners. The authorities
also agreed to improve the business environment by removing key bottlenecks and focusing on
complementary structural competitiveness measures to stimulate private investment.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

VANUATU

OTHER ISSUES
48.
Engagement with donors. Staff held discussions with international partners on their
engagement with the authorities, especially with regard to the disbursements of grants and loans
for reconstruction efforts and infrastructure projects. The mission emphasized the importance of
making grant financing available to Vanuatu in order to maintain debt sustainability and stressed
the need to support the achievements of the SDGs, in particular goals related to eliminating
poverty and combating climate change.
49.
Safeguard assessment. The first-time RBV’s safeguards assessment has been conducted.
It identified several weaknesses in its governance arrangements, autonomy, transparency, and
audit mechanisms. While the RBV has a recognized accounting framework and an external audit
in place, these could be strengthened. The central bank requires recapitalization. The authorities
are planning to seek assistance in drafting the amendments to the RBV Act and formulating a
recapitalization plan through technical assistance from the IMF.
50.
Statistical issues. While broadly adequate for surveillance purposes, quality and
timeliness remain a concern for some data (see the Statistical Issues in the Informational Annex).
Staff encouraged the authorities to seek further support from PFTAC on compilation, analysis,
and dissemination of national accounts statistics.

STAFF APPRAISAL
51.
Reconstruction efforts are beginning to yield positive results, suggesting that a full
recovery from Cyclone Pam is within reach. Growth is expected to rebound in 2016 thanks to
the recovery of tourism and agriculture, and the construction activity from major public
infrastructure projects. Risks to the outlook are nonetheless tilted to the downside with the main
uncertainty being the rate of implementation of public infrastructure projects.
52.
Although the immediate response to Cyclone Pam was effective in alleviating
human suffering and restoring economic activity, Vanuatu needs to improve its resilience
to natural disasters. Responding effectively to natural disaster risk entails different layers of
preparedness and response: (i) building domestic fiscal buffers and securing reliable external
financial support; (ii) promoting resilient infrastructure and adequate maintenance; and (iii)
establishing a simple but actionable contingency plan.
53.
Major infrastructure projects have recently started or are in the pipeline posing
sizeable threats to debt and fiscal sustainability. With public debt rising fast, fiscal discipline
and revenue mobilization will be essential. The authorities are commended for launching a
comprehensive tax reform initiative which will help raise additional revenue and reduce the
pressure on fiscal accounts.

22

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

VANUATU

54.
The financial sector has been recovering well from the adverse impacts of Cyclone
Pam, but challenges remain. The RBV must take action to secure financial stability by gradually
normalizing regulatory requirements for banks and non-banking financial institutions. Staff
welcomes the authorities’ recent initiatives to address shortcomings regarding AML/CFT and
encourages them to draw on technical assistance from international partners.
55.
The accommodative monetary stance and exchange rate peg remain appropriate in
an effort to support economic recovery, as well as price and financial stability after the
cyclone. Despite the weak transmission mechanism, vigilance is needed in order to tame
inflation pressures if those emerge and ensure monetary policy remains consistent with the
exchange rate and reserve cover goals. To make the monetary transmission mechanism more
effective, the RBV is encouraged to clarify further its objectives and instruments. The real
effective exchange rate remains broadly in line with fundamentals and the peg should be
maintained at its current level.
56.
Higher growth, job availability, and resilience to external shocks are three key
factors to ensure poverty is reduced and prosperity is shared. A concerted effort by the
authorities to promote private sector investment by further implementing land reforms and
enhancing quality upgrading in the tourism and agricultural sectors is required. Improving access
to employment opportunities and financial inclusion should continue to be a priority to
strengthen households’ resilience to external shocks, especially in the outer islands.
57.

It is recommended that the next Article IV Consultation takes place on the standard

12-month cycle.

Appendix II. Vanuatu: Authorities’ Response to Past Fund
Policy Advice
Fund Recommendation
Fiscal Policy
To the extent possible, seek grants to finance
reconstruction activities and infrastructure projects.

Policy Actions
The authorities obtained sizable grant financing from
donors for reconstruction efforts in the aftermath of
Cyclone Pam. They are committed to seeking financing
at concessional terms—in particular through grants—
for new projects.

Rebuild fiscal buffers and create room for important
social and development expenditures by
reprioritizing spending, strengthening public
financial management, and increasing tax and nontax revenues.

The authorities released the Vanuatu Infrastructure
Strategic Investment Plan (2015-2024) which includes
prioritization, funding, and implementation of
infrastructure projects. The authorities launched a
review of Revenue Modernization and Reform—Building
an Effective Tax System / Regime in 2016 and issued a
press release on the approval of personal income and
corporate tax. They plan to seek TA from the Fund on
the implementation stage of the tax reforms.

Establish ex-ante contingency planning and
financing for natural disasters in the medium term.

The government established a Recovery Committee in
August 2015 to more effectively plan for natural
disasters and coordinate reconstruction efforts. The
authorities still need to complement domestic buffers
with externally financed instruments, such as contingent
credit lines with multilateral partners.

Monetary and Financial Sector Policy
Continue to support the economy and the banking
system by providing liquidity to banks with
appropriate safeguards. Be ready to withdraw the
liquidity once the situation is stabilized and
inflationary pressures emerge.

The accommodative monetary policy swiftly imposed in
the aftermath of the cyclone played an important role in
supporting economic recovery and financial stability.
Balance sheets of banks have become stronger in 2016
thanks to sufficient liquidity provision to the financial
sector. The RBV stands ready to assess banks’ financial
situation to ensure financial stability, and to tighten
capital requirements if deemed necessary.

Exchange Rate Policy
Maintain the exchange rate basket peg at the current
level for now but be ready to review and adjust the
level to support the external sector.

The vatu peg to an undisclosed basket has been an
important nominal anchor during the recovery period.
Despite a mild appreciation in recent months, the real
effective exchange rate remains broadly in line with
fundamentals.

Structural Policies
Submit the new government business enterprises
(GBEs) law to Parliament and proceed with its
rationalization plans for commercial GBEs.

Though a new GBE law was not passed in Parliament
last year, the authorities are planning to submit the GBE
law to Parliament during 2016.

Boost competitiveness in the private sector by
diversifying the economy and improving the
business climate

The authorities along with strong support by donors
and development partners aim at improvements in
product quality especially in the agricultural sector that
accounts for around 70 percent of the labor share.

Appendix III. Public Investment, Debt Sustainability, and
Natural Disasters in Vanuatu1
Scaling up public infrastructure investment
Vanuatu’s ambitious public investment plan helps foster recovery from cyclone Pam with key
infrastructure. The government recently launched its 2015-2024 strategic infrastructure investment plan,
prioritizing projects and suggesting financing sources. Short-listed priority projects add US$407 million
infrastructure (mainly in transport, energy, and telecommunications) to ongoing infrastructure projects
estimated at USD307 million. Representing more than 96 percent of 2015 GDP (55 percent of GDP in new
projects), the 10-year investment plan is expected to be
mostly financed with the support of bi- and multilateral
partners (USD273 million) and through private sector

investment plan to raise related current expenditures

Sources: Authorities and IMF staff estimates and projections.

Risks linked to poor implementation capacity and limited availability of concessional financing to
sustain high levels of capital spending demand a closer look at the macroeconomic implications of
the investment program. To that end, we use the dynamic small open economy model developed by
Buffie et al. (2012; called the Debt, Investment, and Growth or DIG model) to explore the effects of the
planned scaling up of public investment on GDP growth and debt sustainability. The model is calibrated to
fit Vanuatu’s specificities with projected public investment and concessional debt financing provided
exogenously. In addition to making explicit the nexus between public investment and growth, the modelbased approach allows to compare the dynamic response of key macroeconomic aggregates contrasting
alternative assumptions about the return on public infrastructure, the persistence of absorptive capacity
constraints and inefficiencies in the investment process, and the financing mechanisms available (taxes,
transfers, external concessional, external commercial, and domestic debt).
Reaping the benefits of public investment depends on several factors with competing
macroeconomic effects. Sensitivity analyses show the importance of investing in key infrastructure
projects while minimizing stringent bottlenecks.2 The greater the inefficiencies and absorptive capacity
constraints, the lower are the gains for the economy. By slowing the accumulation of public capital, more
inefficient public investment translates into lower GDP, while lower returns on public infrastructure suggest
a lesser crowding-in effect of private investment. Furthermore, although the authorities expect the public
investment program to be mostly financed by concessional debt and grants, the timing of external inflows
implies some fiscal adjustment. The steep increase in taxes (or decrease in current expenditures) needed
when the government faces stringent inefficiencies and absortive limitations (red and yellow curves in
40

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

VANUATU

figure) have a pervasive effect on private consumption and private investment. The wasted resources have
a clear tradeoff by compelling the government to leverage additional resources for much lower benefits.
Efforts are therefore needed to enhance public
investment management. As Lee et al. (2016)

Public Investment and Real GDP under Alternative Returns,
Efficiency, and Absorptive Capacity Constraints

show, Pacific Island Countries (PICs), and Vanuatu
in particular, have substantial scope to improve
public investment efficiency.3 Through improved
public financial management systems, adequate
planning, and better implementation, Vanuatu’s
ambititous investment program would yield a
more favorable macroeconomic outcome.
Debt financing mechanisms transfer the burden to future generations with a positive impact on
growth; however, debt sustainability considerations are now key.4 Reliance on domestic debt financing
(red curve in figure below) crowds out private investment by competing for finite resources in the
economy, which in turn leads to lower growth. On the other hand, external commercial borrowing (yellow
curve) yields the greatest level of growth contributing the lower real interest rate these operations carry—
with the caveat of assuming a relatively constant
country risk premium—and the non-crowding out
effect on private consumption and private

investment. In these scenarios, public debt is
expected to remain well above 70 percent of GDP
(from 26 percent in 2015) over the following
decades. The risk of debt distress under these
alternative scenarios shows the importance of
securing (mostly) grant-based financing of the
public investment program.
Building resilience to natural disasters5
As one of the most vulnerable countries in the world, Vanuatu is at risk of damaging natural
disasters. Introducing a natural disaster shock of the magnitude of Cyclone Pam allows to explore the
dynamic adjustment of Vanuatu and study debt sustainability risks following years of intensive public
investment spending. The shock hits Vanuatu in 2026, causing sizeable damages and losses (2 percent of
current output is destroyed and permanent damages to
the country’s capital stock (private tradable
and nontradable sectors, and public capital)

Total Public Debt and Real GDP under the Baseline, Natural
Disaster, Adaptation Scenarios

amounts to 9 percent of GDP and lead to a
temporary decrease in productivity in the
following three years). Under this scenario,
Vanuatu’s public debt sustainability is under
considerable pressure, with external debt
increasing rapidly and total public debt

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

41

VANUATU

reaching 80 percent of GDP (i.e. an additional 5 percentage points) in the years following the disaster.6
Building resilience to natural disasters is key. An extension of the previous model incorporates public
investment in adaptation and accounts for a faster recovery of productivity as a result of fully functional
institutions in coping with the damages of the disaster. Private consumption and private investment are
able to recover at a faster pace thanks to reduced productivity losses, while real GDP tends to be less
affected by the disaster when adaptation investments are deployed. The authorities should seek to anchor
their investment program on an adaptation approach to natural disasters and climate change, enhancing
the resilience of major infrastructure and services.
Concluding remarks
The simulations therefore present the following lessons:



Public investment efficiency, coupled with an enhanced public financial management and a careful
selection of infrastructure projects are key to achieve higher growth and debt sustainability.



An aggressive scaling up of public investment increases the level of GDP but poses sizeable threats to
debt and fiscal sustainability when grants and concessional financing are not enough to cover the
investment program.



A concerted effort with the private sector and international financial institutions is therefore needed to
ensure the public investment program yields the expected returns and that financing at concessional
terms is available.



Given the recurrence of natural disasters and the extent of damages these cause, authorities should
seek to:
-

Incorporate disaster costs into the budget planning (accounting for the average impact on growth,
destruction of productive capital, and loss of productivity) and make adequate allocations for
operation and maintenance.

-

Invest in building ex ante resilience (appropriate adaptation measures, infrastructure, urban
planning and coastal zone management) and build fiscal buffers.

-

Develop a simple but actionable framework for coping with natural disasters (plan, institutions, and
responsabilities) to accelerate the recovery process.

Prepared by Ricardo Marto (RES).

Given the post-disaster reconstruction phase Vanuatu finds itself in, the baseline scenario assumes a high gross rate of
return on public infrastructure (30%)—congruent with a low stock of public capital—and inefficiencies in the investment
process implying that for every dollar invested only half of it is transformed into public capital. The alternative scenarios
assume lower returns, higher inefficiencies, and more severe absorptive capacity constraints.

Appendix IV. Revenue Modernization in Vanuatu: Building an
Effective Tax System1
Public expenditure is an important tool governments have to achieve economic and social and
objectives. Taxes and other revenue are needed to finance quality government expenditure and support
the authorities’ ambitious development plans that aim to create jobs, raise standards of living and
encourage sustainable economic development in Vanuatu.
To provide appropriate government revenues to deliver services that meet the community’s needs
the Council of Ministers launched a review of Revenue Modernization and Reform—Building an
Effective Tax System, in March 2016. Further objectives of the review are to improve the efficiency and
fairness of revenue collections and modernize the tax administration. Currently the value added tax (VAT)
provides almost 40 percent of total revenues excluding grants., A range of fees and charges are also levied,
which are costly to comply with and collect. Tax reform options are being developed by a Revenue Review
Project Team with the Director of Finance and Treasury as project team leader and members from the
Department of Finance and Treasury, the Prime Minister’s Office, the Department of Customs and Inland
Revenue, the Vanuatu Chamber of Commerce, the State Law Office and the Law Commission. The tax
reform scenarios build on previous IMF advice.
Options for building an effective tax system are evaluated by five guiding principles: (i) appropriate
government revenues; (ii) support of economic growth and efficiency; (iii) fairness; (iv) simplicity, certainty
and convenience; and (v) transparency and visibility.
In August 2016 the Government issued a press release that Vanuatu will consider the introduction of
a personal and corporate income tax. The tax reform proposal also includes:



Abolishing fees and charges that are costly to collect and comply with to reduce the cost of doing
business in Vanuatu; and



Bringing forward the PACER Plus reductions in import duties over five years to lower the cost of
living and the cost of capital to support investment and economic growth.

The top personal marginal income tax rate is proposed to be aligned with the company income tax rate
and the recommendation is to have a company income tax rate that is below the rate of neighboring
countries. Among comparator countries Fiji has the lowest rate at 20 percent for resident companies and
17 percent for multinational headquarters.
Determining a tax-free threshold, which is the level of annual income below which people do not
pay income tax, is important. Vanuatu has a large number of people with home produced and
consumed goods, about 70 percent of working people. The tax free threshold should ensure subsistence
living is not subject to income tax. However, small changes in the tax-free threshold have large revenue
impacts. For example: a tax-free threshold of VT 700,000 annual income would exempt about 84 percent of
working people from income taxation; a threshold of VT 600,000 would exempt about 73 percent; and a VT
1 million threshold about 90 percent. Other design issues to consider are the treatment of small businesses,

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

43

VANUATU

the level and mechanism for taxing capital income (such as interest, dividends and rent) and the taxation of
non-residents.
The modernization of the tax administration is being supported by the development of a risk based
compliance improvement strategy and a Strategic and Business Plan. Moreover, a new organizational
structure, a governance framework and an overall modernization strategy linked to the implementation of
an income tax are being designed. These administration reforms are important, as the administrative
challenges in implementing an income tax should not be underestimated.
The introduction of an income tax will have a number of advantages for Vanuatu. It will provide
valuable revenue to improve Vanuatu’s prospects for sustainable development and better living
standards. This revenue should offset any revenue loss from abolishing other small nuisance taxes and
import duties. The income tax will also capture income not currently taxed, including ensuring a share of
income sourced in Vanuatu but taxed in other countries. An income tax will also align Vanuatu’s tax system
with standard international practice. While there may be some impact on investment and jobs, it is unlikely
to be significant as the proposed low rates will still make Vanuatu internationally competitive.
While an income tax will provide a secure source of funding for quality government expenditure, it
will be important to demonstrate accountability and integrity in the use of taxpayer funds to gain
public support for the introduction of the tax. Current and planned government programs should be
reviewed, and the quality of all government spending should be assessed by three criteria: (i) the effects of
government spending programs on economic efficiency, (ii) on equity, and (iii) the provision of safety
nets. The focus should be on the provision of essential public services that support sustainable
development.
Finally, tax reform is an integral part of the proposed Public Financial Management (PFM)
reform. Developing alternative sources of revenue generation was identified as a key priority in a Public
Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessment conducted in 2015 as well as integrated and
medium-term planning and budgeting processes.

Appendix V. Benchmarking Government Business Enterprise
Performance in Vanuatu1
Government Business Enterprises (GBEs), referred to locally as commercial government business
enterprises, play an important role in the Vanuatu economy. GBEs account for about 8 percent of the
total stock of fixed capital and dominate several sectors including banking, broadcasting, postal operations
and transport. The GBE portfolio has historically performed poorly and financial performance has been
declining in recent years.
Comparison with other small island economies provides a useful benchmark for understanding
performance issues and the need for reform. This appendix compares key indicators for Vanuatu’s GBE
portfolio with other small island economies in the region as well as Jamaica, Mauritius, New Zealand and
Singapore.2 The analysis focuses on the period 2010-2014. Vanuatu has 11 GBEs. However, only eight are
active and regularly producing audited financial accounts.3 The three largest – National Bank of Vanuatu
(NBV), Air Vanuatu (Operations) Limited, and Airports Vanuatu Limited (AVL) – accounted for 96 percent of
total GBE assets.
Vanuatu’s GBE portfolio is relatively small compared to other countries in the region (Figure 1). This
is largely because it has successfully contracted out the provision of water and power services to the private
sector. However, the portfolio is relatively concentrated in non-infrastructure, commercially-oriented
activities, in particular financial services (Figure 2). This includes the NBV and the Vanuatu Agriculture
Development Bank (VADB). Such activities have less strategic justification than infrastructure services and
risk crowding-out the private sector and distorting markets. As GBE financial performance tends to
compare poorly to the private sector, this suggests a significant productivity cost for the economy. Indeed,
GBEs add only 0.24 percent to Vanuatu’s GDP for every 1 percent share of the total fixed capital stock they
hold.

The financial performance of Vanuatu’s GBE portfolio, more generally, compares poorly with other
countries in the region (Figure 3). During 2010-2014 available financial statements indicate that the
portfolio’s Return on Assets (ROA) averaged -0.13 percent and Return on Equity averaged -0.39 percent –
the second worst performance in the region and far lower than the best performing portfolio, Solomon
Islands, which averaged a ROA of 6.7 percent and ROE of 10.0%. Asset utilization, which measures the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

45

VANUATU

efficiency of assets in generating sales, also shows that Vanuatu’s GBE portfolio is amongst the weaker
performers.
Reflecting poor financial performance, GBEs represent a significant and ongoing fiscal cost for
government. Government transfers to GBEs averaged 2.3 percent of general government expenditure
during 2010-2014 (Figure 4). This is the third highest amongst the comparator group, although significantly
lower than that in the Republic of Marshall Islands and Jamaica, with large GBEs losses in the latter having
contributed to macroeconomic concerns. By contrast, a number of countries in the region have been able
to realize negative government transfers to GBEs (i.e. dividends).

Unfunded Community Service Obligations (CSOs) are a significant burden for Vanuatu’s GBEs. CSOs
involve activities operating on non-commercial or subsidized terms. If not properly contracted and funded,
CSOs reduce profitability and undermine efficient management by the GBEs themselves as well as
government in pursuing its policy objectives. Air Vanuatu contributed 94 percent of GBE losses during 2008
to 2014, reflecting unfunded CSOs estimated at Vt176 million in 2013 alone and resulting in a Vt1.4 billion
loan and a Vt2.2 billion guarantee from the government. In 2016 the government is providing another
financing package for Air Vanuatu, to be disbursed in two tranches valued at a total of Vt423 million. The
financial performance of NBV has also been declining in recent years due in part to unfunded CSOs for
rural outreach, estimated to cost about $1.7 million in 2014.
Experience in the region shows that reforms to
strengthen commercial-orientation and
accountability can improve GBE performance,
though political will must be sustained through
time. Countries that have undertaken the most
substantive reforms such as Solomon Islands and
Tonga are seeing improvements in financial
performance (Figure 5). Moreover, GBE productivity in
these countries also appears to have been rising. By
contrast, the financial performance of Vanuatu’s GBE
portfolio has been declining.

46

Vanuatu adopted a broad-based GBE reform policy in October 2013 under the Cabinet at the time
however implementation has been weak. For instance, an GBE Monitoring Unit has been formally
established but remains under-resourced. An GBE minister is yet to be appointed and sector ministers
continue to be responsible for GBEs in their portfolio. In 2011 parliament passed a bill to liquidate the
Vanuatu Commodities Marketing Board but so far there has been no action. An GBE Bill based on the 2013
policy has been prepared and is planned to be submitted to government during 2016. Passage and
implementation of the GBE Bill would provide a solid foundation for improving GBE performance, in
particular by requiring GBEs to generate profits to cover their cost of capital, putting in place a framework
for funding CSOs, and prohibiting the appointment of civil servants and elected officials to GBE boards.

Appendix VI. Monetary Policy Framework in Vanuatu1
The primary monetary policy objectives of the Reserve Bank of Vanuatu (RBV) is to promote
monetary stability (Reserve Bank Act (1980)). Monetary stability is defined as a stable value of money
both at the domestic level (price stability) and at the external level (exchange rate stability). The RBV aims
to achieve this ultimate objective by: (i) maintaining low and stable inflation rate with CPI-based headline
inflation within 0 to 4 percent per annum, and (ii) maintaining a sufficient level of official foreign exchange
reserves at a minimum of 4 months of import cover.
The monetary policy instruments of the RBV have evolved from rule-based instruments (reserve
requirements and standing facilities) to a more market-based instrument (money market
operations). Since 1998, monetary policy has been mainly conducted by open market operations in RBV
notes, supplemented by the Statutory Reserve Deposit (SRD) and two standing facilities:








RBV Notes through Open Market Operations (OMO). The Reserve Bank issues RBV notes with
various maturities up to 91 days and auctions them regularly through a variable-rate tender
system to absorb excess liquidity that is not bound by SRD requirements. The amount of RBV
notes to be issued at each auction is determined to achieve a desired level of money supply
consistent with the projected demand for liquidity in the financial system.
Statutory Reserve Deposit (SRD). The SRD, or reserve requirements, requires banks to maintain
currently 5 percent of deposits at the central bank which was reduced from 7 percent after Cyclone
Pam in March 2015. The SRD is calculated on a monthly average basis and applies to all demand,
time, and saving deposits in domestic currency as well as to 50 percent of demand deposits in
foreign currency. The RBV does not use the SRD (but rather, OMO) for short-term liquidity
management.
Standing Facilities. The RBV can provide temporary liquidity to banks through the Rediscount Facility
and Repurchase Facility. The rediscount rate applies to these operations.
Rediscount Rate. The rediscount rate is the RBV’s official or policy rate. However, under the
monetary aggregate targeting, the RBV does not conduct OMO to influence market rates to move
towards the rediscount rate. In addition, given the high structural excess liquidity in the financial
system, the rediscount window has been rarely used in the past. Hence, the rediscount rate—and
similarly the interbank rate—has not changed much over time and it may only serve as a signaling
device regarding the RBV’s monetary policy stance. However, after Cyclone Pam the rediscount
rate was reduced from 5.5 percent to be tied to RBV’s 91-day bill rate (1.85 percent in March
2015). In May 2016, the rediscount rate was adjusted to “RBV’s 91-day bill rate (1.85 percent in
May 2016) + 1 percent”.

The operational policy target for OMO is the volume of banks’ excess reserves based on short-term
liquidity projections. The implementation of monetary policy is carried out by the Financial Markets
Department of the RBV. As discussed above, the RBV relies largely on OMO as a main instrument to fine
tune the level of liquidity in the domestic financial system. Since its introduction, the RBV’s OMO has been
partially successful in absorbing excess liquidity from the system (IMF, 2004).2 Although participation has
been broadened by allowing nonbanks to participate in the auctions of RBV notes, there has not been

48

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

VANUATU

actual participation of nonbanks yet because the payment system is not ready to settle the transactions by
nonbanks.
The ability of monetary policy to effectively control domestic monetary conditions is limited in
Vanuatu due to its highly open economy and fixed exchange rate regime, shallow financial markets,
and limited financial access in the overall economy. Movements in the policy rate hardly have an effect
on interest rates in the economy, and no policy instruments seem to play an important role in output and
inflation dynamics. Recent studies find that monetary policy transmission in Vanuatu is generally weak
especially through traditional interest rate and credit channels (Hililan, 2013, Yang et. al, 2011, and
Jayaraman, 2009).3 The existing policy instruments do not seem to operate coherently or to be consistent
with any objective, partly reflecting the multiple objectives including price stability and financial system
stability that the RBV aims to achieve with monetary policy tools. Although the current framework has
served the country well by delivering low inflation and adequate foreign exchange reserves, it has been
evident that monetary policy transmission is generally weak and monetary policy has limited ability to
control domestic monetary conditions. Further financial deepening, more clear description of the monetary
policy objectives, a coherent usage of the existing monetary instruments with a clear understanding of the
transmission mechanism, would allow for more flexible monetary policy framework and to enhance the
effectiveness of monetary policy in responding to liquidity shocks.

Appendix VII. Possible Benefits from Increased Labor Mobility1
The ability to access external labor markets varies significantly across the Pacific. Some countries in
the Pacific have free labor market access to the United States and New Zealand. Others have historically
had high levels of labor mobility. Vanuatu, along with its Melanesian neighbors, Papua New Guinea and
Solomon Islands, has among the lowest rates of outward migration in the world. These three ‘low mobility’
countries account for just 5 percent of the stock of Pacific migrants living in OECD countries, despite
making up approximately 85 percent of the region’s population.
As a part of its Pacific Possible report, the World Bank is examining what possible benefits could be
obtained by Vanuatu and other Pacific countries over the next 25 years if both sending and
receiving countries were to significantly alter their existing policies and practices on labor migration.
Key reforms for receiving countries proposed in Pacific Possible include: expanding access through existing
migration pathways, such as the seasonal worker schemes and the working holiday maker programs;
opening up access to new labor markets, such as Korea via its Employment Permit System; providing access
to new sectors, like aged care, through programs tailored for the Pacific; and expanding opportunities for
permanent migration, especially for the ‘low mobility’ countries and atoll island states most impacted by
climate change. Expanding access to the lower-skilled entry pathways in Australia and New Zealand is likely
to prove most promising in the immediate term, and would allow Vanuatu to build on its current strong
performance in the seasonal worker schemes. Vanuatu itself could also do more to develop appropriate
education and training policies, which will help manage the risks from ‘brain drain’; market its workers more
effectively; and introduce measures to manage the negative social impacts of labor mobility.
If Vanuatu and the receiving countries were able to implement these reforms, the potential gains
are significant. Estimates indicate that the stock of ni-Vanuatu migrants could increase from 2,280 in 2013
to 23,000 by 2040. This would generate an additional USD43 million in remittances. Evidence from a multiyear impact evaluation of seasonal workers in Vanuatu suggests that these remittances will have sizeable
poverty impacts for those that remain at home, with participating households experiencing a 34 to 38
percent increase in per capita income (Gibson & McKenzie
Vanuatu GNI+ Per Capita, 2000-2040
(USD)
2010). However, the largest gains would be for the migrants

themselves who would benefit from critical employment

benefits, a new measure for the economic impacts of
4000
migration has been developed, Gross National Income Plus

(GNI+), which includes GNI as well as the income earned by
2000
longer-term migrants living abroad. Using this indicator, the
per capita gains for Vanuatu through to 2040 could be

Appendix VIII. Exchange Rate Issues: Competitors and Sectors1
Diverging exchange rate fluctuations with main trading partners’ currencies is not exclusive to
Vanuatu. Most other Pacific Island Countries (PICs), which are key competitors in the tourism industry, have
also experienced some appreciation of their currency against the AUD and some depreciation against to
USD—thus relative price competitiveness of Vanuatu as a tourist destination should still be preserved.
Despite its cyclical volatility and as opposed to some of its neighbors, Vanuatu’s REER seems to be broadly
consistent across time.

Sectors are being affected differently depending on the predominant foreign currency in use and
some may experience a price competitiveness loss. Since Australia accounts for about 59 percent of
tourist arrivals (over the 2005-2015 period) and the majority of foreign aid, the vatu’s appreciation against
the AUD could adversely affect the tourism sector and the value of aid flows. So far, the price elasticity of
demand for tourism suggests a low sensitivity to nominal fluctuations with tourist arrivals steadily bouncing
back after the airport’s runway repairs and the reopening of hotels and resorts.2Agricultural exports, on the
other hand, are spread across Australia (18 percent, over the 2010-2015 period) and several other Asian
countries (Philippines, Malaysia, Japan, New Caledonia, Fiji, and Papua New Guinea accounted for an
additional 56 percent) and may be more insulated against the recent nominal fluctuations.

A sectoral decomposition of the REER can help understand some of the discrepancies and
competitiveness challenges faced by certain sectors.3 To assess price competitiveness in a specific sector,
weights of the REER can reflect sectoral trade flows and inflation can be expressed in terms of a subset of its
components. With data availability as a constraint, we compute alternative specifications of the REER
assuming weights are implied by tourism receipts,

Tourist arrivals from Australia and New Zealand have had an historical seasonality, peaking in the third quarter of the

year and dipping in the first quarter.

The REER is a function of a weighted average of indexed nominal bilateral exchange rates and inflation differentials.

There are several measures of aggregate price fluctuations, such as the consumer price index, wholesale or producer
price index, GDP deflator, or unit labor costs, and weights can be underpinned by trade flows in goods or goods and
services. For the baseline scenario, inflation differentials are based on consumer price indices and weights in Vanuatu’s
effective exchange rates are based on the 2004-2006 trade flows.

After abandoning its peg to the SDR in 1988, the Reserve Bank of Vanuatu determines the value of the vatu on the basis

of an undisclosed transaction-weighted basket of currencies. Solomon Islands does not disclose the basket composition
of its pegged exchange rate regime, while the currencies of Samoa and Tonga are anchored on announced foreign
exchange (U.S. dollar, Australian dollar, New Zealand dollar, Euro (Only Samoa), Fiji dollar (only Tonga)).

Exchange Arrangements
Since 1988, Vanuatu has officially maintained an adjustable peg exchange rate arrangement.
Currently, the exchange rate of the vatu is linked to a transactions-weighted (trade and tourism
receipts) basket of currencies. The weights and composition of the basket, which are not publicly
disclosed, are adjusted periodically. The Reserve Bank of Vanuatu (RBV) quotes daily buying and
selling rates for the vatu against the U.S., Australian, and New Zealand dollars; the euro; the U.K.
pound; and the Japanese yen. The rate in terms of the U.S. dollar as of August 31, 2016 was
VT 108.72 per U.S. dollar. The de facto classification is “other managed,” as the composite weights
are not disclosed and cannot be confirmed. Vanuatu has accepted the obligations of Article VIII,
Sections 2, 3, and 4, and maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on payments and
transfers for current international transactions.
Article IV Consultation
Vanuatu is on a 12–month consultation cycle. The previous Article IV consultation mission took
place during April 15-28, 2015 and the consultation was concluded on June 5, 2015 (Country Report
No. 15/149).

2016, missions were conducted to prepare authorities for a review of non-tax revenues; assist with
risk-based planning and other business processes for internal audit, including on the use of the
audit software TeamMate, a guided PEFA self-assessment and development of a framework for
formulating a PFM Reform Roadmap. Follow-up TA is planned in FY17 to continue the internal audit
reform and formulation of a PFM Reform Roadmap.

Macroeconomics
In the macroeconomic area, PFTAC has provided assistance to the Reserve Bank of Vanuatu (RBV) in
developing a Model Of the Vanuatu Economy (MOVE). The MOVE, which generates medium-term
projections within an internally consistent macroeconomic and fiscal framework, is being used by
the Ministry of Finance and Economic Management (MFEM) to inform a review of Vanuatu’s tax
system. In addition, staff members from the Office of the Prime Minister and MFEM participated in
regional workshops, co-hosted by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and
the Pacific (ESCAP) Pacific Office and the Pacific Islands Tax Administrators Association (PITAA), on
government expenditure and revenue forecasting.
Tax Administration
Supported by PFTAC, Vanuatu has made steady progress over the last few years which has included:
(a) the development of a new strategic and business plan; (b) a risk-based compliance improvement
strategy; (c) implementation of performance standards; and (d) the development of an IT strategy
followed by the implementation of an IT system that has facilitated taxpayer compliance. A Revenue
Review Governance Committee and Project Team, recently appointed by Vanuatu’s MFEM, has been
tasked with drafting a framework for modernizing Vanuatu’s tax system and includes two main
deliverables: (a) a review of the current tax policy regime and exploration of the possibility of
introducing an Income Tax (as previously recommended by the IMF); and (b) a review of the current

organizational structure and governance arrangements which PFTAC supported through a recent
technical assistance mission.

Financial Supervision
In FY2016 PFTAC conducted a series of technical assistance missions involving on-site examination
of banks and revisions of the Credit Union Act and oversight capacity building. The Reserve Bank of
Vanuatu indicated that those sectors were a priority for technical support. In addition, in June 2015,
the PFTAC Financial Supervision advisor visited Vanuatu to advise on implementation of a postnatural disaster (Cyclone Pam) banking sector recovery strategy, as well as to draw lessons from
Vanuatu’s experience for other PFTAC members.

BANK–FUND COUNTRY TEAM CONSULTATIONS
(As of August 2016)
Representatives of the World Bank accompanied the IMF team on the Article IV mission to Vanuatu
(July 13-26, 2016) and participated in discussions with the Government of Vanuatu. The Bank and
Fund country teams also exchanged views on the main macroeconomic issues facing Vanuatu and
appropriate policy responses.
Fiscal Issues
The teams agreed that careful fiscal planning will be required to finance necessary development
expenditure (including Cyclone Pam-related reconstruction spending) while at the same time
ensuring debt sustainability. Where possible, the authorities should seek external financing on grant
or highly concessional credit terms. The authorities should also aim to rebuild fiscal buffers over the
medium term, including by taking steps to increase domestic revenues through the introduction of
income and corporate taxes. The teams agreed that formulating an infrastructure investment plan in
line with national priorities, and ensuring discipline and allocative efficiency in public expenditure
more generally, will be important in responding to fiscal challenges.
Public Investment
The scaling up of investments in infrastructure should be complemented with broad reforms aimed
at enhancing the business environment, promoting tourism (including in newer long-haul markets),
and improving the resilience, consistency and quality of agricultural output. The teams welcomed
efforts to strengthen institutions for climate change adaptation and disaster risk management,
including by strengthening early warning systems. Both teams noted the importance of promoting
inclusive growth, which will be supported by government strategies to ensure the widespread
provision of basic services and employment opportunities, particularly in the less-populated islands.
Exchange Rate and AML/CFT Issues
The teams agreed that the vatu peg to a basket of currencies has served Vanuatu well and should be
maintained, given the importance of exchange rate stability for maintaining confidence. Both the
IMF and the Bank welcomed the government commitment to address current deficiencies in
controls on anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism.
Collaboration
The teams have the following requests for information and collaboration from their counterparts:



The Fund team requests to be kept informed of progress in various projects and analytical work
undertaken by the Bank in order to use resources efficiently and avoid work overlaps.
The Bank team requests that the Fund make available to the Bank its latest macroeconomic
assessments and macroeconomic data from time to time, as inputs to the Bank’s lending and
non-lending operations.

RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of August 2016)
Operational Strategy
The Asian Development Bank’s (ADB’s) Country Operations Business Plan for 2016–2018 is aligned
with the government’s Priorities and Action Agenda and aims to assist the government in
(i) transport—by providing support for improved connectivity to markets and social services;
(ii) urban development—by improving access to sanitation and drainage facilities and improving
urban infrastructure with a particular focus on Port Vila; and (iii) energy—by rural electrification and
renewable energy sources. Consistent with the government’s strategy of fostering private sector-led
growth, ADB also focuses on improving the enabling environment for the private sector through
improving access to financial services, reforming business laws, and supporting state-owned
enterprise (SOE) reform.
ADB’s indicative allocation to Vanuatu of Asian Development Fund loan and grant resources for
2017–2019 has been set at USD37.29 million, including USD9.73 million in disaster risk reduction
financing. In addition to this, ADB will also provide on average approximately USD500,000 per
annum in technical assistance (TA) grant support. To leverage ADB’s impact and reduce borrowing
costs, co-financing opportunities will be pursued with other development partners.
Portfolio Status
Since joining ADB in 1981, 14 loans have been provided to Vanuatu for a total amount of
USD89.36 million, 9 grants totaling USD66.74 million, and 62 TA projects totaling USD22.45 million.
More than 50 percent of the loans and TA projects were for the transport sector. ADB resumed its
lending operations in Vanuatu with the approval of two projects in the last quarter of 2011. These
were for the Vanuatu Interisland Shipping Project (USD52.12 million), co-financed by the
Government of New Zealand, and the Port Villa Urban Development Project (USD39.10 million), cofinanced by the Government of Australia.
There are three ongoing TA projects amounting to USD1.13 million: TA 8724-VAN: Supporting the
Preparation of the National Sustainable Development Plan; TA 7938-VAN: Establishment of the
Maritime Safety Administration; and TA 9073-VAN: Institutional Strengthening for Environmental
Safeguards in Vanuatu.
Interisland Shipping Support Project
The aim of this project is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of interisland shipping services
through provision of an integrated package of assistance. It comprises two major components:
(i) infrastructure investments in the capital of Port Vila and five outer islands, and (ii) establishment
of a shipping support scheme to catalyze the provision of services to remote noncommercial
destinations. The project is complemented by associated TA to improve sector governance through
institutional strengthening and legal and regulatory reforms, and by project management services.
ADB is providing a loan of USD29.30 million, the Government of New Zealand a parallel grant of
USD17.25 million, and the Government of Vanuatu USD5.57 million.

VANUATU

Port Vila Urban Development Project
The aim of this project is to improve drainage, roads, and sanitation systems in greater Port Vila
municipality and adjacent urban and peri-urban areas in the Shefa province. The project is
implementing the recommendations of the drainage and sanitation master plan prepared through a
project preparatory TA, which identified priority interventions for improved access to, and delivery of
drainage and sanitation services to the residents of Port Vila. It is supporting affordable, sustainable,
and effective sanitation, roads, and storm water drainage services, and is contributing to climate
resilient and sustainable urban development in and around Port Vila. ADB is providing a loan of
USD5.0 million and administering the corresponding grant of USD31.0 million from the Government
of Australia. The Government of Vanuatu is providing a contribution of USD3.1 million.
Private Sector Development
Private sector development in Vanuatu is supported through the Pacific Private Sector Development
Initiative (PSDI). PSDI is a regional technical assistance facility cofinanced by the Government of
Australia, the Government of New Zealand, and ADB. PSDI works with Pacific developing member
countries to improve the enabling environment for business and support inclusive, private sector-led
economic growth. ADB’s support under PSDI focuses on (i) improving access to financial services;
(ii) business law reform; and (iii) state-owned enterprise reform.


Improving Access to Financial Services. ADB supported the secured transactions framework
reform through the drafting and passage of the Personal Property Securities Act, and the
installation, and later upgrade, of an electronic registry to record the filing of security interests.



Business Law Reform. ADB assistance has focused on drafting a new Companies Act, a new
Companies (Insolvency and Receiverships) Act, and a new Insolvency (Cross Border) Act. Support
was also provided for online companies, business names, and charitable associations registry.



State-Owned Enterprise Reform. ADB supported preparation of an SOE reform policy,
approved by Cabinet in October 2013, and the subsequent drafting of SOE legislation. ADB has
also been working with several SOEs on reform and rationalization strategies, including
recommending liquidation where appropriate.

Cyclone Response
Following Tropical Cyclone Pam in March 2015, ADB’s immediate support to the government
consisted of (i) the approval of USD1.0 million grant financing from the Asia Pacific Disaster
Response Fund, and (ii) deployment of urban and infrastructure specialists to Port Vila to provide
assistance. This was followed by the approval of two cyclone recovery projects for the reconstruction
of Vanuatu’s roads and schools.
Proposed Pipeline Projects
ADB’s forward pipeline includes a proposed Energy Access Project that will support increased energy
access to households and businesses in the provincial centers of Vanuatu through expansion of
existing distribution grids and the development of low-cost renewable energy generation from
hydropower.

VANUATU

An urban development project for Luganville and a second phase of the Port Vila Urban
Development Project are also proposed. Vanuatu’s participation in regional projects for tourism and
agribusiness financing are being discussed with the government.
ADB–World Bank Joint Development Coordination Office
An ADB–World Bank joint Development Coordination Office was opened in June 2010 in Port Vila.
The shared field presence has improved ADB’s responsiveness to the development needs of
Vanuatu and supports aid coordination and aid effectiveness. In 2016, the office will be upgraded to
become the Vanuatu Extended Mission, strengthening ADB’s presence on the ground.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. In particular, national
accounts and external sector statistics need to be further improved, while the coverage of government
finance statistics could be expanded. Reporting lags could be shortened.
National accounts: While there have been improvements in methodology and the development of
additional data sources, the accuracy of the recently-released, experimental expenditure-based GDP
estimates could be further improved. Data are compiled only on an annual basis. Due to recent staff
changes in Vanuatu National Statistics Office, there may be delays in 2015 GDP release. PFTAC is providing
technical assistance in national accounts compilation, including rebasing the constant price GDP estimates
using 2010 as the new base year, the improvement of the experimental expenditure-based GDP, and the
development of estimates of GDP on a quarterly basis.
Price statistics: The CPI weights are based on 1998 household surveys, and only cover the two urban
centers of Port Vila and Luganville. Rebasing the CPI to a more recent base year may start after a new
Household Income and Expenditure Survey in 2017.
Government finance statistics: Budget classification is broadly consistent with the GFSM2001. Work is
underway to migrate budget classification to GFSM2014. Government operations data are compiled for the
central government only and exclude public enterprises and operations of provincial governments and the
two municipalities, as well as grant bodies and other central government extra-budgetary units. The
operations of the budget are recorded on a cash plus invoice basis.
Monetary statistics: The Reserve Bank of Vanuatu (RBV) reports monthly monetary data, including the
accounts of the monetary authorities and commercial banks (only in aggregate), and the distribution of
loans by sector in its monthly bulletin posted on its website. The RBV also publishes a quarterly report with
wider coverage of financial data including fiscal transactions and key financial soundness indicators.
Information on financial access is sparse, and could be usefully expanded to allow for better assessment of
financial inclusiveness and monetary policy transmission.
External sector statistics: The RBV releases quarterly BOP data in its Quarterly Economic Review. A special
Debt Unit has been created within the Ministry of Finance for public debt management and recording in
2015; however, the recording and management of public debt needs further improvement. Two external
sector statistics missions visited Vanuatu in the second half of 2015 to assist the authorities in improving
the collection and reporting of external debt and external sector statistics.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Approved By

Luc Everaert and Peter
Allum (IMF) and John
Panzer (IDA)

Prepared by the Staff of the International Monetary
Fund and the International Development Association
(IDA).

This update of the debt sustainability analysis (DSA) shows that Vanuatu’s risk rating for debt
distress remains moderate, since the evolution of debt indicators remains similar to that
obtained in the 2015 DSA. The level of public debt began to rise in 2015 and will continue to
increase over the next few years due to the implementation of major public infrastructure
projects and reconstruction activities. This is expected to be manageable provided that the
financing terms are concessional and the surge in financing needs is temporary. Nonetheless,
repayment obligations will likely put pressure on the economy and will require fiscal
adjustment over the medium term. The DSA has been extended to include an alternative
scenario of a Cyclone Pam-like natural disaster within 5 years, under which debt sustainability
deteriorates in the aftermath of the event. The authorities are recommended to pursue
prudent fiscal policies, including spending reprioritization and tax reform implementation, and
seek grant financing for infrastructure investments in the next few years to ensure debt
sustainability over the medium term.

VANUATU

BACKGROUND
1.
Vanuatu is recovering from Cyclone Pam that hit the country in March 2015. The
damages from Cyclone Pam had a smaller-than-expected effect on growth, thanks to the
resilience of Vanuatu’s economy and the swift response from the international community. A
number of infrastructure projects started their construction phase after Cyclone Pam, with the
bulk of spending boosting public external debt.
2.
In 2015, the face values of external and total public debt, as well as total (public
and private) external debt increased steeply. The country’s rapid debt accumulation was
attributed to disbursements for infrastructure projects and the IMF’s funding support through
the Rapid Credit Facility (RCF) and Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI). Total central government
debt rose to 25.6 percent of GDP and external public debt increased to 17.9 percent of GDP.
Total external debt stood at 34.1 percent of GDP. Due to data limitations, external liabilities of
commercial banks are used as a proxy for private external debt.
3.
At the end of 2015, central government domestic debt was estimated at 7.7 percent
of GDP. It constitutes 23.2 percent of total debt and consists of government bonds placed with
the Reserve Bank of Vanuatu, commercial banks and other financial institutions (primarily the
Vanuatu National Provident Fund).
4.
Vanuatu’s public external debt is mostly concessional (17.9 percent of GDP). It has
been contracted from multilateral lenders (IMF, EIB, WB-IDA and ADB) and via bilateral
agreements (China Ex-Im Bank). Typically, the nominal interest rates on these instruments (except
for China Ex-Im Bank) are fairly low (0-2 percent) and loan maturity is long (20-40 years), which
reflects a relatively high grant element of the debt and a low debt service.

METHODOLOGY AND ASSUMPTIONS
5.
The DSA is produced using data provided by the authorities and estimates from
IMF and World Bank staff. The DSA framework uses a discount rate of 5 percent. Total public
debt includes central government debt, publicly guaranteed debt by Government Business
Enterprises (GBEs), and the Fund’s RCF/RFI to Reserve Bank of Vanuatu.
6.

The following are the key macroeconomic assumptions under the baseline scenario:



GDP growth. The economy continues to recover from Cyclone Pam despite some delays
due to political uncertainty in the second half of 2015 and airport runway safety issues in
early 2016. GDP is projected to increase by 4 percent in 2016, and accelerate to 4.5
percent in 2017 as infrastructure projects and reconstruction gain speed. In the period
2016–2021, growth is expected to average 3.3 percent, supported mainly by public
investment, tourism, and agricultural exports. Long-term growth is maintained at 3
percent.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND





Fiscal balance. The primary balance is projected to be negative at 9.7 percent of GDP in
2016 before widening to -16.2 percent of GDP in 2017, reflecting increases in
expenditures due to Cyclone Pam reconstruction and infrastructure projects. We assume
a gradual improvement of the fiscal balance to -4.2 percent of GDP in 2021.
Capital expenditures. Many planned public investment projects began in 2015. The road
and school reconstruction projects financed by the ADB and the WB are expected to start
in 2017. Public capital expenditures are estimated to peak at 12.6 percent of GDP in 2017
and decline to 2.6 percent (close to historical values) in 2021. New external borrowing is
expected from the ADB, WB, JICA (with concessional terms), and the China Ex-Im Bank.
Imports and exports. We assume that imports-to-GDP ratio continues above 40 percent of
GDP through 2015 to 2017 driven by the high import content of reconstruction and
projects (around 30 percent before the cyclone). At the same time, we expect exports to
increase to 7.8 percent of GDP in 2016 and to 8.3 percent of GDP in 2017 as recovery is
underway for tourism and major agricultural exports.
Inflation. Inflation is projected at 2.2 percent in 2016. We assume a further increase to 2.5
percent in 2017 due to demand pressures from reconstruction activities and
infrastructure projects, and a gradual increase to 3 percent by 2019.

EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
7.
The baseline scenario indicates that the external debt of Vanuatu remains
sustainable. All external debt ratios stay below the thresholds over the projection periods. Under
the baseline, the face value of external public and publicly-guaranteed (PPG) debt peaks in 2021
at 51.6 percent of GDP. Its present value (PV) remains below the DSA threshold, peaking at
29 percent in 2021. Vanuatu’s public external debt service ratios are also relatively low, reflecting
that most of its public external debt is highly concessional.
8.
One threshold for public external debt is breached under standard tests. In the most
extreme shock scenario (“Terms-of-trade shock”), the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio breaches the
threshold of 40 percent. However, the breach is temporary, as the effects of the shock wind
down. Other indicators of debt sustainability—the PV of debt-to-exports ratio, the PV of debt-torevenue ratio, the debt service-to-export ratio, and the debt service-to-revenue ratio—remain
below their respective thresholds.
9.
The historical scenario yields debt ratios that are below the projections in the
baseline case, reflecting the deterioration of macroeconomic prospects and a widening of
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 3

VANUATU

medium-term deficits caused by Cyclone Pam and on-going public investments. This historical
scenario is produced using the average of the past 10 years for key macroeconomic variables
and shows a decline in the PV of the debt-to-GDP ratio compared to the baseline, while all other
indicators have the same path.

PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
10.
Public debt ratios are likely to be sustainable provided that the government
continues to seek a mix of grant and highly concessional financing. Under the baseline
scenario, the PV of total public debt is projected to increase from 23.8 percent of GDP to 38.5
percent of GDP by 2021. By 2036 it is expected to decline to 22.4 percent of GDP. Thus the PV of
public debt remains significantly below the benchmark. The PV of debt-to-revenue ratio is
expected to increase to 230.7 in 2022 and then decline gradually to 136.9 percent by 2035.
11.
The standard tests show one breach of thresholds. The PV of debt-to-GDP breaches
the benchmark of 58 percent of GDP in a scenario in which the primary balance is held fixed at its
2016 level, reflecting risks of maintaining high level of fiscal deficits from debt-financed public
investments. This scenario is less realistic as fiscal space is expected to improve in the medium
term after infrastructure projects’ completion. However, this suggests that prudent selection of
future public investment should be made in line with not only the country’s development
strategy, but also its debt-carrying and implementation capacity.

ALTERNATIVE SCENARIO OF ANOTHER MAJOR
NATURAL DISASTER EVENT
12.
The extreme natural disaster shock replicates Cyclone Pam’s estimated impact on
the economy.1 The shock results in the reduction of real GDP growth by roughly 4 percentage
points, a deterioration of fiscal balance of about 4 percent of GDP, and about 6 percent of GDP
of additional external public debt in the year of the disaster. Under this scenario, the external and
public debt sustainability deteriorates significantly right after the event. Two of the thresholds,
the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio and PV of debt service-to- revenue ratio, are breached, suggesting
substantial pressures from a major natural disaster on the economy.

1

In addition to the extreme natural disaster shock scenario we have considered adjusting macro projections to
reflect the average impact of natural disasters by calculating the historical annual average damage to the
economy as reported by EM-DAT for the period 1990-2014. This was found to be modest at 0.12% of GDP
growth – despite Vanuatu’s high rate of natural disasters. Given the small magnitude of the average effect, we
chose not to incorporate it in the medium-term growth projections.

CONCLUSION
13.
Vanuatu’s risk of debt distress remains moderate and the planned trajectory of
debt accumulation is similar to that obtained in the 2015 DSA. The country’s debt rating was
elevated from “low risk” in 2013 to “moderate risk” as a result of the 2015 cyclone and planned
infrastructure spending. In the baseline scenario, external and public debt levels are projected to
rise steeply over the next few years and peak at substantially higher levels before starting to
decline. In order to set public debt ratios on a downward trajectory while making room for
priority social and developmental expenditures, the authorities must continue their cautious
borrowing strategy and rebuild fiscal buffers over the medium term through strengthening
public finance management, reprioritizing spending, and mobilizing new revenue resources
(including with the introduction of income taxes within a comprehensive tax reform). Given
Vanuatu’s vulnerability to natural disasters, additional extreme weather events are likely to have
large adverse cumulative effects on the country’s fiscal position and debt sustainability (as
indicated by the alternative shock scenario), reinforcing the case for seeking grant financing with
bi and multilateral partners for post-disaster reconstruction while pursuing risk reduction
investments, and ensuring public investment is efficient.

AUTHORITIES’ VIEWS
14.
The authorities broadly concurred with the assessment of debt sustainability
analysis. They noted that the ambitious development plan and reform agenda may cause more
pressure on debt sustainability and agreed with the importance of rebuilding fiscal buffers over
the medium term. They conveyed their intention of seeking grant financing for new projects and
expected the comprehensive tax reform to yield additional revenues.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming

an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Statement by Barry Sterland, Executive Director for Vanuatu, and Chris
Stewart, Advisor to the Executive Director of Vanuatu
October 21, 2016
The Vanuatu authorities thank staff for an open and frank set of discussions and useful
policy advice during the Article IV consultation. There is a large amount of agreement on
the challenges facing Vanuatu. In the immediate term, the country continues to recover
from the devastation caused by Cyclone Pam in March 2015. In the longer term, the
authorities recognize the need to undertake deeper reforms to bolster the country’s
resilience. Indeed, the authorities remain committed to strengthening their risk
assessment and planning capabilities, as well as their economic and fiscal buffers.
Particular importance is placed on sound and resilient infrastructure investment to further
development goals, the modernization of the taxation system – including through the
introduction of both household and corporate income taxation – and efforts to address
AML/CFT concerns.
Recent Developments and the Outlook
Economic activity is continuing to strengthen following Cyclone Pam. Reconstruction
activities are progressing and services have picked up as tourists return. The economy has
gained further impetus from a number of infrastructure projects, many of which had been
on hold. There are signs that business optimism and investment are lifting, including in
response to political stability, the new Government’s decisive actions to implement
reforms, and confidence in the legal system.
The authorities generally agree with staff’s outlook and assessment of the risks,
although note that there are a number of important upside risks. In particular,
successful implementation of the Government’s infrastructure plans would directly boost
economic activity and could catalyze further private sector activity. Authorities
acknowledge that this will depend on successful and timely implementation.
Fiscal Policy
The authorities’ infrastructure-focused fiscal policy will be implemented within
Vanuatu’s absorptive capacity. Indeed, even before the cyclone, a number of transport
projects had been delayed or downsized to minimize sequencing problems. As such, the
authorities are continuing to work closely with development partners. This will not only
help ensure that stimulus remains appropriately timed, but will also improve project
planning and implementation capabilities, maximizing the gains from public investment.

2
The Government is seeking to modernize the taxation system. This will introduce
personal income and corporate tax arrangements and modernize the system’s
operation. This will help strengthen Government finances, improve public financial
management and strengthen Vanuatu’s ability to deal with external shocks. At the same
time, the government is trying to support the poor through appropriately calibrating the
personal income tax’s tax-free threshold. These reforms will also make the business
environment more attractive through reducing a number of minor fees and charges, and
strengthen businesses through reducing import duties. It will be important to bed this
system down smoothly. As such, the authorities are undertaking public consultations on
the new system and will greatly appreciate the assistance of the IMF in its
implementation.
Efforts are underway to improve public financial management. The Government
agrees with the need to improve fiscal discipline, particularly around reducing the need
for supplementary budgets, better accounting for maintenance costs and reducing the
overall costs associated with government machinery. They also appreciate the benefits of
enhancing domestic buffers to combat natural disasters noting, however, the challenge
imposed by competing demands. The Government’s actions to address the long-standing
backlog of severance payments will not only improve public financial management but
will also address a number of negative effects across the economy. In particular,
uncertainty about severance payments for nurses, police and teachers has resulted in
pension-eligible staff delaying their retirements. These sectors had curtailed the hiring of
new staff and, in the case of the nursing, have had to close down the teaching college for
two years given the lack of new positions.
The authorities remain committed to putting the public debt-to-GDP ratio on a
declining path over the medium term and appreciate the importance of seeking
grant financing for any new infrastructure projects. The authorities feel that their
infrastructure investment agenda is needed to achieve critical development needs, but are
also conscious of the need to carefully plan and sequence project. They appreciate the
need to rebuild buffers in the medium term and maximize grant funding.
Monetary Policy
The Reserve Bank of Vanuatu’s actions have continued to help Vanuatu achieve
both low and stable inflation and a stable peg over the past year. The RBV stands
ready to adjust policy as appropriate, noting the changing developments in economic
activity and acknowledging the staff’s analysis that the exchange rate is in line with
fundamentals and that the pegged exchange rate has provided the economy with a useful
nominal anchor.

3
Financial System
The banking system is well capitalized and very liquid. The decline in nonperforming loans is a welcome development, particularly after Cyclone Pam
interrupted businesses’ and households’ incomes. The authorities are considering ways
in which they could improve access to credit, building on the establishment of a national
Financial Inclusion Task Force in 2013, a separate Financial Inclusion Unit at the RBV in
2016, and financial literacy programs by the RBV and commercial banks. This includes
pursuing, with the Ministry of Education, formalizing a financial education curriculum in
schools, and the diagnostic assessment of banks’ financial situations. Such work will be
assisted by some of the lessons from the RBV’s completion of a financial inclusion
demand side survey in 2016 which identified gaps in the financial inclusion agenda,
given the needs, access/barriers and usage of financial services and products. The RBV
Board of Directors has proposed amendments to legislation to strengthen aspects of
regulation around AML/CFT (see below). The RBV is also working with PFTAC on
improving the RBV’s prudential policies for credit unions that fall within the RBV’s
legal minimum threshold, and assisting in drafting a new Credit Union Act to improve
supervision of this sector.
The authorities continue to focus on ways to further improve Vanuatu AML/CFT
framework. A national committee has been established within the PM’s Office to work
on this issue. Recent actions include the RBV’s work on a new risk-based manual on
AML/CFT, assessing international banks’ AML documents to assess their risk tolerances,
and new requirements around registering money changers. At the same time the Financial
Intelligence Unit is revising its guidelines and there have been changes to the automatic
exchange of information. Furthermore, a number of amendments have been drafted and
these will be discussed in Parliament towards the end of 2016 or early 2017. The
authorities have received valuable assistance from FATF’s Asia-Pacific Group and, most
recently, authorities have begun to work with both the World Bank and the Australian
Government to further this work. These actions will help Vanuatu remain connected to
international financial markets. Vanuatu remains committed to rectifying the deficiencies
identified in the mutual evaluation report and improving Vanuatu’s effectiveness at
combating money laundering and terrorist financing, so that Vanuatu can be removed
from the FATF public statement.
Structural Reforms
The authorities are working closely with ADB to improve the operation of
Government Business Enterprises (GBEs). The authorities have re-established the
Public Accounts Committee, with the newly appointed members starting a review of one
GBE providing stevedoring services. Beyond this, legislation on GBE to improve
corporate governance of GBEs will be tabled in Parliament in November 2016. This will,

amongst other things, liquidate four of the remaining GBEs. The office of the Auditor
General has completed audits and reports of the operations of GBEs in 2015. The Asian
Development Bank and World Bank are also working with Air Vanuatu in reviewing its
domestic and international routes (the airline is expected to make a small profit this year).
The authorities welcome the report’s acknowledgement that their development
strategy pays particular attention to poverty and inclusion. The authorities’ focus on
infrastructure will improve accessibility, reduce business costs and facilitate quality
upgrading and diversification, including through attracting more and higher quality
tourism. This will be complemented by other, more specific measures. The authorities
are, for example, continuing to work with smaller farmers to improve both food security
as well as these farmers’ livelihoods. Likewise, the Council of Ministers is scheduled to
endorse the completion of the trade agreement under the Pacific Agreement on Closer
Economic Relations (Pacer-Plus) with other Pacific Island countries, Australia and New
Zealand by December 2016. Trade negotiations with the EU will quickly follow. Finally,
the authorities remain committed to improving the business environment and stimulating
private investment by removing key bottlenecks and supporting reforms that will improve
structural competitiveness.
