March 29, 2006

•

Discussions were held in Beirut October 17–27, 2005, and concluded
February 7–13, 2006. The missions comprised Messrs. Gardner (head),
Mongardini, Poddar, and di Giovanni (all MCD), Le Borgne (FAD), Mumssen and
Tzanninis (both PDR), and Josefsson (MFD). Messrs. Di Tata (MCD), Shaalan,
and Nauphal (both OED) participated in policy discussions. The missions met with
the prime minister; the governor of the central bank; the ministers of finance,
economy and trade, telecommunications, and energy; other senior officials; and
representatives of the public electricity company, the social security
administration, the banking sector, the chamber of commerce and industry, and the
labor union.

•

Lebanon has never used Fund resources. It accepted the obligations of
Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 in 1993 and maintains an exchange system free
of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international
transactions; controls on capital account transactions are minor, and relate mostly
to a prohibition on domestic borrowing by nonresidents. Lebanon is on the
standard 12-month cycle, but interim staff reports are issued for information of the
Executive Board in between Article IV consultations. The last such report
(IMF Country Report No. 04/313) was issued on September 2004. The 2005
Article IV consultation was delayed by political developments in 2005.

•

Lebanon participates in the General Data Dissemination Standards. The fiscal
ROSC was published in May 16, 2005, and the last FSAP update was concluded
in 2001.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background and recent developments
Lebanon was able to weather the confidence shock created by Mr. Hariri’s assassination in
February 2005, although GDP growth slowed down considerably. The deposit base shrank by
4 percent in the first half of the year and dollarization shot up. By mid-year, monetary policy
intervention and a peaceful exit from the political crisis had restored confidence. In the
absence of new policy initiatives, the primary fiscal surplus dipped to 2½ percent of GDP in
2005, and government debt rose to 175 percent of GDP. Part of the cost of financial
stabilization in recent years, and again in 2005, has been absorbed by the central bank with a
resulting increase in its losses.
Outlook and policy discussions
•

Vulnerabilities remain very high and the events of 2005 weakened an already fragile
financial situation. The high concentration of government debt in the banks’ balance
sheets heightens systemic risks. Short-term liquidity conditions remain favorable, not
least because of the ample regional liquidity. However, in the absence of adjustment,
the large fiscal financing need could create new pressures on international reserves.

•

The authorities see a soft exit out of the debt overhang as the sole viable option and
have prepared a program of fiscal adjustment, privatization and structural reforms.
However, political instability has so far prevented cabinet approval of the program.

•

The staff’s illustrative adjustment scenario, based on fiscal measures equivalent to
7 percent of GDP and privatization, would reduce the debt ratio to 133 percent
by 2011. Concessional financial assistance would be needed to reduce the debt ratio
further, and closer to a sustainable level. The authorities concurred with the overall
size of the fiscal adjustment, but left open the issue of its phasing over the medium
term. The scenario does not envisage exchange rate changes or debt restructuring.

Staff appraisal
•

Because Lebanon will continue to operate at very high levels of debt into the medium
term, the strategy of gradual debt reduction through sustained fiscal adjustment is not
without risks. Given the high exposure of Lebanon to financial shocks and political
uncertainty, the government program should lock in a large upfront fiscal adjustment
backed by vigorous privatization and reform.

•

The exchange rate peg remains the appropriate monetary anchor for Lebanon, and
needs to be supported by a flexible interest rate policy, a strengthened central bank
balance sheet, and close policy coordination between the fiscal and monetary
authorities. Financial stability relies crucially on depositor confidence, and continued
close supervision of the banking sector should be another key element of the strategy.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Following the Paris II donor conference of November 2002, Fund staff
intensified the frequency of surveillance at the behest of donors. The Paris II conference
endorsed the authorities’ exit strategy out of the high debt overhang, based on a package of
fiscal adjustment, privatization and structural reforms. However, implementation of the
strategy suffered numerous setbacks, and advice provided in the context of Fund surveillance
has had limited success in steering policies in the direction of faster adjustment and reform,
mainly because of domestic political gridlock and instability. While Lebanon weathered
successfully the confidence shock created by Mr. Hariri’s assassination in February 2005, the
associated financial turmoil weakened what was an already fragile situation. The authorities
see in the political transformation heralded by the June 2005 parliamentary elections an
opportunity to relaunch a broad program of economic and institutional reform. Against this
background, Article IV discussions focused on the macroeconomic risks ahead and a
medium-term strategy to restore the financial health of the state and establish the foundations
for strong economic growth.
II. BACKGROUND AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
2.
Economic and financial developments since 2003 have been shaped by major
changes in the political landscape. Policy initiatives were frozen during the political
stalemate that prevailed prior to and following the extension of President Lahoud’s term in
September 2004. Mr. Hariri’s assassination led to the resignation of the government and
plunged the country into a period of political and financial turbulence. Despite continued
political assassinations and bombings, market confidence was gradually restored following
the withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon and the June parliamentary elections. Upon
taking office in July, Prime Minister Siniora announced that the government would seek the
support of the international community for an ambitious economic reform and adjustment
program to be introduced by end-2005. Renewed political tensions—over relations with
Syria, the legitimacy of the president, and UN calls for the disarmament of Hezbollah (one of
the coalition partners in the government)—have caused repeated delays in the adoption of
these plans.
3.
Economic growth slowed down considerably in 2005.1 A surge in tourism and
construction activity, and strong exports contributed to GDP growth of 6 percent in 2004.
However, in the wake of the political crisis, private and public demand contracted in 2005,
though export growth remained strong. In the event, real GDP is estimated to have grown by
1 percent, and inflation declined to 0.3 percent in 2005.

1

A set of national accounts covering the period 1997-2002 was released for the first time in 2005, with
preliminary estimates for 2003–04. Based on these accounts, nominal GDP is about 12 percent higher than
previous estimates.

-6-

4.
Mr. Hariri’s assassination and subsequent political crisis triggered
significant financial turmoil and pressures on international reserves. In the two months
that followed the assassination, some $2 billion in deposits was withdrawn and another
$5½ billion was converted into dollar deposits (Figure 1). The central bank absorbed some of
the pressure through its international reserves (Figure 2), and also took action to counter
financial pressures through: (i) swap operations, backed by higher interest rates and financial
sweeteners, to lengthen the maturity of commercial banks’ claims on government and the
central bank; and (ii) the issuance of 10-year dollar CDs yielding 10 percent interest to attract
and lock in some of the foreign assets of the commercial banks. In order to avoid a
downgrading of banks’ ratings and its possible impact on confidence, incentives provided to
banks included upfront cash payments to shore up profits. A sharp rise in interest rates on
Lebanese pound (LL) deposits eventually contributed to stabilize the situation, until the
effects of the political crisis waned.
5.
By mid-year, the financial situation had stabilized. Deposit inflows resumed at a
high pace, accompanied by gradual dedollarization. The $750 million Eurobond issue of
October 2005 was heavily oversubscribed, notably by international investors; by mid-March
2006 Eurobond spreads had declined to a record low of 180 basis points, broadly in line with
the global emerging market index (Figure 3). The stock market similarly picked up steam
after the June parliamentary elections. Despite a sizeable correction in February 2006, by
March the stock index was still 150 percent above its end-2004 level. Still, total
capitalization remains small by emerging market standards (20 percent of GDP), with
Solidere (the real estate holding company which owns much of downtown Beirut) accounting
for over 60 percent of it, and banks for much of the rest.

6.
The economic slowdown as well as buoyant exports helped narrow the current
account deficit to an estimated 12.7 percent of GDP in 2005, notwithstanding higher oil
prices and losses in tourism. The negative shock to the capital account in the first half of the
year was more than offset by the recovery of FDI and portfolio inflows in the second half,
and by end-2005 gross international reserves were back at their end-2004 level. Owing to
very low domestic inflation, the real effective exchange rate depreciated by 5 percent in
2005, despite the international appreciation of the dollar, to which the currency is pegged
(Figure 4). Although labor costs tend to be higher than in neighboring countries, recent gains
in export market shares do not suggest the presence of an immediate competitiveness
problem. From 2000 to 2005, Lebanon’s global market share rose from 1.1 to 2.1 percent,
and its regional (Middle East) market share grew from 18.4 to 36.1 percent.
7.
In the absence of new policy initiatives to counter the adverse fiscal effects of
rising oil prices and the economic slowdown, the primary surplus dipped to 2½ percent
of GDP in 2005 from 3½ percent in 2004 (Figure 5). Since the 2005 budget was only
approved (ex-post) in February 2006, most expenditure categories were effectively frozen in
nominal terms. However, this form of fiscal austerity was not enough to offset: (i) a one-time
transfer (0.3 percent of GDP) to cover losses in the social security funds; (ii) growing
subsidies to the state electricity company (EdL), whose financial losses are estimated at
3.2 percent of GDP in 2005;2 and (iii) revenue shortfalls attributable in large part to the cap
on gasoline prices introduced in May 2004.

2

Operational losses alone came to 1.9 percent of GDP.

The gradual lowering of the effective interest rate paid on government debt has
contributed to a steady reduction in the overall fiscal deficit (to 8 percent in 2005).
However, the maturing of the zero-interest loans received from banks in the context of
Paris II and the scheduled repayment of below market financing from the central bank will
tend to raise the effective interest rate in 2006. A near stabilization of the government debt
ratio since 2002, was followed by another increase in 2005 owing to weak GDP growth, the
settlement of arrears equivalent to 1.3 percent of GDP, and a new government prefinancing
strategy.3
9.
The central bank has increased markedly its intermediation role since 2002, but
at the expense of its financial strength. Its balance sheet has grown from $13 billion at
end-2002 to $29 billion by end-2005, reflecting (below market) financing of the government
and parallel sterilization operations as well as efforts to replenish international reserves. The
expansion of the balance sheet has been accompanied by growing losses that reflect these
operations, as well as: (i) the transfer to the government of unrealized capital gains on gold
holdings; (ii) the high cost of long-term dollar debt issued in the first half of 2005; and
(iii) the favorable conditions accorded to commercial banks to protect their profitability in
2005. Central bank losses have not compromised monetary control.
3

The strategy is to create a sufficient buffer in government deposits to cover treasury operations for at least
two months. In 2005, this implied an increase in government deposits of 2½ percent of GDP.

- 10 -

10.
The banking sector continues to record profits but remains vulnerable, with
claims on government and the central bank accounting for over 50 percent of assets.
The capital adequacy ratio was 22 percent as of mid-2005, although this high ratio reflects in
large part the low risk weighting applied to government paper. Banks took advantage of
abundant excess liquidity in the region in 2005 to raise capital. Profitability rose by about
13 percent in 2005, buttressed by the cash premium paid by the central bank to rollover
maturing government paper. Still, on average, the return on equity is low by international
standards—although higher for the larger banks. Banks remain highly liquid, with a net
liquid to total asset ratio of 45 percent, and hold nearly $10½ billion in liquid assets abroad.
Lending has stagnated, in part because of widespread over-leveraging in the private sector.
The quality of the loan portfolio has stabilized at a ratio of non-performing loans to total
loans of 10 percent (net of provisions).
11.
Only moderate progress has been made on the structural reform agenda since
2004. Most public sector reforms have been of an administrative nature, with a number of
legislative reforms pending in parliament (Box 1). The EU Association Agreement will come
into effect on April 1, 2006.
III. OUTLOOK AND POLICY DISCUSSIONS
12.
Despite the recovery of confidence, the macroeconomic and financial picture is
still one of high vulnerabilities. Underlying financial imbalances have grown.4 The
government debt ratio has edged up again, and, with some of the financial benefits of Paris II
coming to an end, the interest bill is expected to start rising. Moreover, the financial standing
of the sovereign (central bank and government) has deteriorated at a much faster rate, owing
to the fact that the central bank has absorbed in its balance sheet many of the fiscal costs of
financial stabilization. On the positive side, liquidity conditions have improved markedly
since mid-2005, in terms of international reserve coverage, commercial banks’ liquidity,
and access to market financing. Although Lebanon is well placed to continue capturing some
of the portfolio outflows from Gulf Cooperation Council countries (over $100 billion in
2005), delays in fiscal adjustment will cause the fiscal financing need to rise with possible
new pressures on international reserves.

4

Balance sheet vulnerabilities are also discussed in the accompanying IMF Country Report No. 06/200.

Discussions were organized around the four main pillars of the authorities’
program: (i) fiscal adjustment and debt management; (ii) monetary and exchange rate
policies; (iii) the role of the financial sector; and (iv) the growth and social agendas. In the
absence of a detailed government program, discussions were informed by an “unchanged
policies” (baseline) scenario and an illustrative “adjustment” scenario developed by Fund
staff. The latter draws from policy proposals discussed with the authorities since the last
Article IV consultation.
A. Medium-Term Scenarios and Debt Sustainability Analysis
14.
The government’s solvency problem is illustrated in the staff’s baseline scenario,
which shows that under unchanged policies the debt ratio would rise steadily to over
210 percent of GDP by 2011 (Figure 6). The scenario assumes a vicious circle of growing
debt, rising interest rate spreads, and weak economic growth. It is difficult to predict where
the breaking point lies, but it is clear that such growing financing needs cannot be filled
indefinitely by ever increasing capital inflows.
15.
In the staff’s illustrative adjustment scenario, an ambitious fiscal effort and
privatization reduce the debt ratio to 133 percent of GDP by 2011. The scenario is based
on: (i) fiscal effort of about 7 percent of GDP (much of it front loaded in the first three
years); and (ii) partial privatization of the telecom sector in 2006–07, yielding receipts of
19 percent of GDP.5 The scenario excludes exchange rate adjustment, debt restructuring and
concessional financing.
16.
The illustrative adjustment scenario is predicated on a mix of (mainly upfront)
revenue and (phased) expenditure measures, as detailed in the table below. The
revenue effort (4.3 percent of GDP) comes from an upfront increase in the VAT rate from
10 to 15 percent, reform of the income tax system (including an increase of interest income
taxation), and a phased increase in gasoline excises back to their 2003 level. The expenditure
compression is assumed to take place over time in line with structural reforms in the public
pension system, civil service and wage policy, and the electricity sector. An expansion of
capital spending, which has taken the brunt of the adjustment to date, is assumed to offset in
part the above budgetary gains.
17.
The authorities took a slightly more optimistic view of interest rate and growth
prospects than the staff. The staff’s adjustment scenario assumes that interest rates would
remain roughly unchanged from their present level, despite a projected increase in LIBOR.
This further narrowing of spreads (by 110 basis points for LL deposits, and 60 basis points
for dollar deposits) reflects confidence gains and a lesser financing need. The authorities
were of the view that interest rates could decline further. As for GDP growth, the authorities
expected a stronger rebound in 2006 than the 3 percent growth projected by staff.
5

The transaction has a one-time effect on the level of debt, but no impact on debt dynamics because the loss in
revenue from the privatized entity is broadly offset by a reduction in interest costs.

The staff’s Debt Sustainability Analysis shows that the illustrative adjustment
scenario is not without risks, and that, even if successful, the strategy would still leave
Lebanon with a high debt ratio well into the medium term. Adverse growth and interest
rate shocks can slow down the pace of

Concessional financial assistance from donors and domestic creditors, would
accelerate convergence toward debt sustainability. By way of example, for every
$1 billion of grant-equivalent assistance in 2006, the debt ratio would be reduced by an
additional 5.6 percentage points of GDP by 2011. The authorities have approached the
commercial banks for a voluntary contribution akin to that provided under Paris II, which
came to $3.6 billion in loans at zero interest for three years.
B. Fiscal Policy and Debt Management Strategy
20.
The authorities decided to postpone the 2006 budget in order to integrate it with
their medium-term program, but in the meantime they have introduced a number of
administrative measures to improve budgetary performance. The ministry of finance has
put in place a cash management system to avoid overruns by line ministries and to strengthen
fiscal reporting. Losses in the social security funds (NSSF), and the health fund in particular,
6

The methodology underlying this exercise is discussed in the IMF Country Report No. 06/200.

- 17 -

constitute a large contingent liability for the budget, and the government has initiated an
audit of the fund with a view to assessing the exposure of the state. The government has also
launched an audit of arrears and begun to settle arrears to the private sector (mostly related to
expropriations).
21.
The authorities generally agreed with the overall size of the fiscal adjustment
effort embedded in the staff’s adjustment scenario. However, in their view, the nature and
timing of fiscal adjustment would need to be carefully calibrated to be supportive of the
political and economic renewal of the country, avoid backlashes, and not forestall an
incipient recovery in economic activity. The authorities concurred that the strategy would
have to rely on an increase of the VAT rate—although possibly not of the magnitude
suggested by staff for 2006—a reform of the income tax system, and a gradual increase of
gasoline taxation back to its 2003 level. Plans for introduction of a Global Income Tax
system to replace the current schedular system are under way, based on technical assistance
provided by the IMF’s Fiscal Affairs Department (FAD). The authorities also saw scope for
increasing the withholding tax on interest, presently at 5 percent.7 In the absence of any
noticeable response to the introduction of this tax in 2003, the authorities felt that a modest
increase in the rate would not have a significant effect on money demand.
22.
There was broad agreement that the sustainability of the adjustment effort
depends critically on expenditure reforms, the elimination of open-ended subsidies,
and measures to protect the budget from contingent liabilities. On pension reforms,
the government is working in collaboration with the World Bank to establish a
financially-sustainable and more equitable system, notably by consolidating the private and
public pension systems. The healthcare system managed by the NSSF is another source of
fiscal strain which the government plans to address mainly by strengthening financial
management. The authorities planned to maintain the nominal wage freeze and to rely on
attrition to reduce the size of the civil service, but also acknowledged that these measures
would need to be replaced by a proper civil service reform.
23.
Addressing EdL’s losses is seen as key to fiscal sustainability, although a reform
plan has yet to be finalized. EdL has long been beset by organizational inefficiencies,
governance problems (there are no audited accounts since 2001),8 high technical losses, and
widespread theft and non-payment. Plans to reduce costs by switching to gas imported from
Syria have not come to fruition. There has been a marked reduction in non-technical losses
(from 29 percent in 2001 to 17 percent in 2005), backed by other measures to improve
collection and lower the cost structure, such as improved fuel procurement practices.
However, the breakeven price of oil in electricity production is still around $25 dollars per
barrel. The menu of measures being considered include governance reforms, a partial

An increase to 7 percent, for instance, would generate additional revenues equivalent to 0.4 percent GDP.

The 2001 accounts have yet to be released officially, and have been questioned by the auditors on several
points.

- 18 -

privatization of EdL (to realize efficiency gains), increases in tariffs (unchanged since 1996),
and investments to reduce operational inefficiencies.
24.
The authorities recognized that fiscal adjustment would need to be backed by
stronger budgetary and expenditure management to minimize leakages and overruns.
Public financial management remains relatively weak in Lebanon: hard budget constraints
are not always applied, and cash rationing remains the only effective constraint on spending.
The authorities have been developing a detailed action plan to address these shortcomings,
with assistance from FAD and are considering the introduction of a Fiscal Accountability
Law. The ministry of finance is also in the process of reorganizing its activities to move
towards a more modern function-based administrative structure.
25.
The authorities emphasized the importance of proactive debt management to
reduce interest costs and rollover risk. In line with this approach, they have built up a
significant liquidity buffer in the central bank. In addition to setting up a Public Debt
Directorate, the ministry of finance is also keen to expand the range of financing instruments
to attract longer-term investors, both domestic and international, as a way of reducing
rollover risk.
C. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
26.
In the authorities’ view, the exchange rate peg remains key to the stability of the
financial system. In the absence of a clear need for an exchange rate adjustment, and given
the high level of dollarization, the authorities considered that the risks from exchange rate
movements (in terms of balance sheet exposures) significantly outweigh any potential
benefits (in terms of adjustment to external shocks). This belief was reinforced by the events
of 2005 and the important role played by the peg in preserving confidence.
27.
Based on the strength of capital inflows and the recovery of international
reserves, the authorities did not see a need to match recent increases in international
interest rates. Capital inflows have remained strong, even as interest rate spreads have
narrowed.9 Gross international reserves (GIR) are the indicator followed most closely by the
market. Differences of views between the ministry of finance and the central bank on the
international reserve target have, at times, led to poor policy coordination and tensions over
interest rate policy. This time, staff found a convergence of views between the two
institutions that GIR is presently at an appropriate level. Even though the reserve coverage
of short-term foreign currency liabilities remains low by emerging market standards, based
on the experience of 2005—the worst financial shock suffered since the end of the civil
war—the authorities felt that the present reserve buffer would be sufficient to withstand a
similar large shock until fiscal and other measures can be taken.

9

The IMF Country Report No. 06/200 reports on the close but less than one-for-one empirical relationship between
Lebanese and international interest rates.

- 19 -

28.
Coordination between the central bank and the ministry of finance has
improved markedly. At the root of this are the recent convergence of views on the level of
reserves, a commitment by the ministry not to resort to central bank financing (and to repay
maturing loans), and an agreement to coordinate the bunching of central bank and
government maturities coming due in 2006. To some extent, improved collaboration also
reflects the current benign economic environment.
29.
The central bank recognized the need to eliminate central bank losses over time.
It noted, however, that the losses it has incurred until now have had no monetary impact,
since the associated liquidity injection has been absorbed by growing money demand, or
mopped up by the issuance of long-term central bank paper. The authorities indicated that
loss-making operations had been entered into as a matter of necessity rather than choice, and
that they hoped to unwind them as the financial situation settled down. Based on existing
obligations, central bank (cash) losses should decline rapidly only after 2009. To help
improve its financial situation, the central bank has already introduced fees on many of its
operations, lowered remuneration of commercial bank deposits, and realized gains from the
sale of a bank in its portfolio. The sale of Middle East Airlines (owned by the central bank)
and other real assets is also under consideration. However, these measures can only cover a
fraction of the losses, and additional measures would be necessary to close the financial gap
at a faster rate.
D. Financial Sector Vulnerabilities
30.
The ability of banks to tap into the pool of regional savings has enabled Lebanon
to finance large fiscal and external imbalances over the last 15 years, but the mutual
dependency of the government and the commercial banks has also heightened the
transmission of shocks between the fiscal and financial sectors. The main systemic risk
lies in the possibility of large-scale deposit withdrawals, possibly triggered by concerns
over the solvency of the sovereign. Because of the high degree of dollarization, such
withdrawals could unravel into a banking, balance of payments, and debt crisis. Until now,
weaknesses in fiscal fundamentals have had limited effects on depositor confidence, despite
the high exposure of banks to sovereign debt (Figure 8). The authorities and bankers
attributed this to the strong reputation of domestic banks, the authorities’ demonstrated
ability to honor their financial obligations, and the banking sector’s ample liquidity buffer in
foreign exchange—the liquid foreign assets of commercial banks and the central bank
combined provide cover for 35 percent of total deposits.

31.
Given the importance of maintaining confidence in the banking system, the
authorities continue to place emphasis on effective banking supervision. In order to
further enhance confidence in banks, and increase incentives for prudent risk management,
the authorities and the banks are keen to phase in Basle II standards, starting possibly in
2008. They stressed that the move to 100 percent risk weighting for foreign
currency government debt under Basle II would still leave the banking sector adequately
capitalized—the average capital adequacy ratio would fall to about 10 percent.10 While there
is no currency mismatch in the balance sheet of banks, banks carry significant indirect
exchange rate risk related to domestic dollar lending—particularly to households and
non-exporting firms. In general, such risk seems to be considered of a systemic nature and
therefore not one that banks have an incentive in guarding against at the individual level.
32.
Ample regional liquidity has contributed to the appreciation of bank shares on
the Beirut stock exchange and is making it possible for them to raise large amounts of
new capital. Banking sector capital is expected to increase from around $4 billion in 2004 to
around $5½ billion by end-2006. The banks concerned noted that the increases in capital
were intended to meet new capital requirements under Basle II and to finance their regional
expansion plans (into Algeria, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Sudan, and Syria). Still, an overleveraged
private sector and a financially strained public sector suggest that Lebanon may be
overbanked and point to the need for banking sector consolidation over the medium term.
The view of the authorities, shared by banks, was that some of the smaller banks would have
to exit the market, but that the larger banks were well placed to develop alternative activities.

10

A possible FSAP update would look into these issues in greater depth.

- 21 -

33.
The underdeveloped capital market is seen as an impediment to better risk
diversification and private investment. The authorities believe that the capital market could
provide the overleveraged private sector with a fresh infusion of capital, help mobilize longer
term financing from abroad, and support the privatization drive. However, the absence of an
independent stock market regulator, and of a law against insider trading, were of concern to
many officials and market participants, and raised doubts about the foundations on which the
stock market boom is based. The authorities noted that legislation addressing these issues
was pending in parliament.
E. Structural Policies
34.
Structural impediments to private sector development could limit the growth
dividend associated with debt reduction. Despite the overall market-orientation of the
Lebanese economy, private sector observers and public officials recognized that private
initiative and competition have been stymied and distorted by government intervention, red
tape and corruption, and by the strong hold that special interests have on government
subsidy, tax, and competition policies. The World Bank estimates that monopoly rents may
account for as much as 15 percent of GDP. Governance problems were particularly high on
the list of private sector complaints, as reflected in business surveys.11
35.
A broad growth agenda is intended to address these shortcomings. The
government’s priorities include: liberalization and privatization of the telecom sector and sale
of other government assets; a new competition policy backed by a newly created competition
authority; ongoing streamlining of administrative impediments in collaboration with the
business community; improved efficiency of government spending; and membership in the
WTO (targeted for end-2006). Privatization of the telecom sector is at the core of the
structural agenda. The secretary general of the telecom regulatory authority was appointed in
February 2006, and the authorities are in the process of finalizing the appointment of the
board, ahead of the privatization of the two mobile telephone companies, slated for 2006.
Privatization of the fixed telephone line and a third mobile license should follow in 2007.
36.
High on the list of government priorities is the establishment of a modern and
well-functioning social safety net. Income distribution in Lebanon remains very uneven and
the most vulnerable segments of society are presently protected only though generalized
subsidies. Based on available information, Lebanon’s social indicators have improved in
recent years, but they still fall short of expectations.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
37.
The events of 2005 exposed the significant vulnerabilities of the Lebanese
economy, but also its resilience in the face of shocks. The very heavy public debt
overhang, the high degree of dollarization, large fiscal and current account deficits, and
11

The IMF Country Report No. 06/200 reports on these and other measures of competitiveness.

- 22 -

reliance on short-term deposit inflows to finance these deficits remain the core
vulnerabilities. The risks associated with these imbalances have been muted by a benign
external environment, ample regional liquidity, and the relative stability of the depositor
base, even in the face of worsening fundamentals. Factors explaining this unique strength
include the liquidity cushion held by banks, a strong reputation of safe banking built over
decades, and the authorities’ skillful handling of the financial pressures experienced in 2005.
38.
With market confidence restored, the ongoing political transformation creates
an opportunity to address the country’s macroeconomic imbalances through
fundamental and lasting reforms. The ultimate objective of the adjustment and reform
program should be to protect Lebanon against the risk of a financial crisis and raise the
country’s growth potential. A positive external environment has helped revitalize economic
activity in 2003-04, and the recovery that began in the second half of 2005 should gain
strength in 2006. However, the uncertainty associated with the large macroeconomic
imbalances continues to exact a cost in terms of private investment, while inefficiencies and
red tape thwart competition and productivity growth. Delays in the adoption of the
authorities’ program could also create renewed financing pressures.
39.
Although not without risks, the strategy of gradual debt reduction through
sustained fiscal adjustment remains the most promising way out of the debt overhang.
Upfront debt restructuring carries too large a risk that it will not converge to a stable
macroeconomic situation. Still, Lebanon will continue to operate at high levels of debt into
the medium term, and the highly fractured political system may not be able to deliver the
sustained pace of adjustment required. To restore credibility, the authorities should aim at
locking in a large upfront adjustment based on a strong fiscal effort in the first year of their
program. With additional measures in 2007–08 and a vigorous privatization effort, the
strategy would place the debt-to-GDP ratio on a clear downward path. Concessional financial
assistance from abroad and a contribution from domestic creditors, commensurate with their
financial strength, would also be required to accelerate convergence to a sustainable debt
level.
40.
The magnitude of the required fiscal adjustment calls for both revenue and
expenditure measures, backed by institutional reforms to strengthen budgetary control.
Expenditure reforms are likely to yield meaningful gains only over time, and revenue
measures should necessarily be part of the initial package. Given the fiscal adjustment need,
the tax revenue yield could be raised by aligning the VAT rate to that of other countries in
the region, and introducing a more efficient and more progressive income tax system. The
taxation of gasoline should also be revisited, since the state cannot afford to shield the
economy from the high cost of oil. On the expenditure front, there is scope for reducing nonproductive outlays, such as subsidies, and poorly targeted capital and current spending. The
impact of rising fuel costs on the losses of the electricity company has overtaken efforts to
improve collection and reduce technical losses, and restoring the financial viability of the
electricity sector should be a core element of the adjustment strategy. Pension reform also
appears urgent to correct looming imbalances in the system. Needed improvements in the
statistical framework would help strengthen policy formulation and implementation.

- 23 -

41.
The exchange rate peg remains the appropriate monetary anchor for Lebanon,
and needs to be supported by a flexible interest rate policy and a comfortable
international reserve buffer. Not only does the high degree of dollarization constrain the
effectiveness of the exchange rate as an instrument of adjustment, but until confidence can be
anchored to stronger fundamentals, the exchange rate peg is also key to financial stability.
Shocks to confidence are transmitted mostly through the large deposit base, and the large
liquid foreign holdings of commercial banks offer an important first line of defense against
such shocks. With this added buffer, and in light of recent experience, the present level of
international reserves appears to strike a reasonable balance between the competing
objectives of minimizing the cost of holding reserves and maintaining sufficient liquidity.
42.
The central bank’s balance sheet is no longer in a position to carry the full cost
of sterilization operations or to finance the public sector. Strong policy coordination
between the fiscal and monetary authorities, backed by enhanced institutional
arrangements, is required to improve monetary management and strengthen the
central bank’s balance sheet over time. Until now, the monetary impact of central bank
losses has been muted by the buoyant demand for money. However, in the event of an
adverse shock to deposits, it will become increasingly difficult to sterilize the liquidity
impact of central bank losses and maintain, at the same time, an adequate cushion of
international reserves. Timely actions to strengthen the balance sheet of the central bank
should be an integral part of the adjustment strategy. They should include a recentering of
central bank operations on monetary and liquidity management, and an unburdening of its
balance sheet of real assets. It is also important to capitalize on the improved degree of
collaboration between the central bank and the ministry of finance to place explicit
constraints on central bank financing of the government, to institutionalize policy
coordination, and to achieve a better distribution of the fiscal costs of financial stabilization.
43.
The success of the adjustment strategy depends crucially on preserving depositor
confidence. Confidence is linked to the credibility of the government’s program, the
effectiveness of the central bank’s financial management, and perceptions about the
soundness of the banking sector. On the last point, staff is encouraged by the proactive stance
of banking sector supervision in monitoring risks and providing an effective regulatory
framework, which could be reinforced by providing legal protection to supervisors. Although
the systemic problem of the commercial banks’ exposure to the government cannot be
addressed fundamentally by regulatory means, a strong supervisory framework can help
mitigate the exposure of banks to market and other credit risk. This is particularly important
in a context where the Lebanese banks will gradually have to develop profitable activities
other than intermediating government paper. This will likely entail a consolidation of the
banking sector. The authorities would be well served by preparing the necessary safeguards,
including a well functioning deposit guarantee scheme, for such consolidation to take place
in an orderly market-based manner. Adoption of an independent and strong securities
regulator with adequate legal protection is also urgent to build confidence in and protect the
stability of the burgeoning stock market.

- 24 -

44.
In order to revitalize economic growth, the short-run costs of adjustment should
be counterbalanced by an explicit growth agenda. There appears to be considerable scope
for productivity gains in the private sector. To realize them, there is a need to: (i) enhance the
quality of government services, raise the productivity of government capital spending, and
reduce the burden of red tape on the private sector; (ii) reactivate the liberalization and
privatization of the telecom sector, to lower input costs for the economy and promote the
creation of new services; and (iii) improve the business climate and competition by reducing
the high costs of entry and exit, strengthening contract enforcement, eliminating
monopolistic practices, and addressing corruption decisively.
45.
In all, there is considerable convergence of views between the authorities and
staff on the reforms that are needed in the period ahead, but Lebanon can ill afford
protracted delays in these reforms. In the view of staff, vulnerabilities and risks remain
very high, and an incremental approach to reform will remain exposed to political risks down
the road. The authorities should seize the unique opportunity offered by the ongoing political
transformation and the interest of the international community in supporting Lebanon to
make sizeable upfront progress in their reform and adjustment agenda.
46.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Lebanon take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

Adjustment Scenario

I. Adjustment Scenario

2007

1/ Central government gross debt.
2/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + αε(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; α = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and ε = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as αε(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
7/ Real depreciation is defined as nominal depreciation (measured by percentage fall in dollar value of local currency) minus domestic inflation (based on GDP deflator).
8/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and primary balance) remain at the level in percent of GDP/growth rate of the last projection year.

B1. Real interest rate is at historical average plus two standard deviations in 2007 and 2008
B2. Real GDP growth is at historical average minus two standard deviations in 2007 and 2008
B3. Primary balance is at historical average minus two standard deviations in 2007 and 2008
B4. Combination of B1-B3 using one standard deviation shocks
B5. One time 30 percent real depreciation in 2007 7/
B6. 10 percent of GDP increase in other debt-creating flows in 2007

B. Bound Tests

A1. Unchanged policies: no further primary adjustment after 2006
A2. Fiscal adjustment and unchanged nominal interest rates from 2005 onwards

APPENDIX I

Technical Assistance, 2000–05

Fiscal area—In recent years, FAD has provided advice on introducing the VAT, reforming
customs tariffs and income taxes, strengthening the tax and customs administrations,
improving public expenditure management, and consolidating fiscal accounts. This technical
assistance was well received by the ministry of finance and, notably on the VAT, its positive
impact has been substantial. However, considerable needs remain in several areas of public
finance, including tax policy, tax administration, budget preparation, fiscal management, and
public accounting and reporting. A number of technical assistance missions took place in
2004 in support of the government's reform initiatives and dealt with: (i) treasury and budget
reforms, (ii) reforms in revenue administration, and (iii) tax policy. Technical assistance
missions in 2005 primarily dealt with (i) the consolidation of fiscal accounts, and (ii) public
liquidity management. A fiscal ROSC mission visited Beirut in September 2004 and
published its report in May 2005.
Financial sector—Over the past few years, the Monetary and Financial Systems Department
has provided technical assistance in the areas of payments system and vulnerability
indicators. The related missions undertook an assessment of compliance with Core Principles
for Systemically Important Payments Systems, advised on development of systems to
improve efficiency and liquidity management in public sector payments and receipts, and
assisted in the elaboration of a framework for collecting and analyzing macro-prudential
indicators to facilitate the development of capacity to monitor systemic financial sector
vulnerabilities. The authorities have reported some progress in these areas. A mission
provided technical assistance in financial sector indicators and payments systems in March
2004. Follow up missions in January and August 2005 provided further technical assistance
on the payment system and development of an early warning system, including a bank-level
“watch list” based on, among other indicators, an econometric model to forecast bank
performance. A technical mission in December 2005 examined issues concerning liquidity
management in the monetary system.
Statistical area—The Statistics Department has provided technical assistance on the
development of price and balance of payments statistics, but so far, little progress has been
achieved. There are no official producer price index (PPI) and consumer price index (CPI)
data available, and the balance of payments data remain incomplete. In addition, Lebanon
still does not report balance of payments data to the Statistics Department. In early 2002, a
multisector statistics/GDDS mission provided an update on the status of data in all economic
sectors, and prepared action plans for improvement. As a participant in the Coordinated
Compilation Exercise, the BdL is compiling financial soundness indicators (FSIs) in
accordance with the IMF’s Compilation Guide on Financial Soundness Indicators. The
Technology and General Services Department has provided technical assistance for creating
a time-series database at the BdL. Technical assistance needs remain substantial, particularly
in the areas of national accounts, price statistics, and balance of payments.

Lebanon: Relations with the World Bank Group
The World Bank (Bank) has prepared a full-fledged new Country Assistance Strategy (CAS),
which was scheduled to be presented to the Board during the first quarter of calendar year 2005.
The CAS was postponed after the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafic Hariri, and the
ensuing political uncertainty and upheaval. The Bank is currently discussing the draft CAS with
the new Government, and could submit the strategy to the Board in December 2005. The strategy
covers the fiscal years 2006–09 and is being prepared together with the International Finance
Corporation (IFC) in a fully participatory manner, including discussions with donors and civil
society. Extensive consultations have taken place with the government, parliamentarians, private
sector, and civil society. The Bank foresees the CAS to encompass three clusters of activities:
(i) Economic management and growth support: restructuring of state-owned enterprises,
statistical capacity building, pension and social security reform, public investment
information systems, trade facilitation, secondary cities economic development;
(ii) Resource and environmental management: surface water, ground water, waste water
treatment, other environmental issues; and
(iii) Developing human capital and mitigating the poverty effects of transition: demand
driven/small-scale operations implemented by local governments/non-governmental
organizations.
The Bank’s existing portfolio in Lebanon consists of $322 million in commitments for
seven projects (of which $227 million is undisbursed). The current portfolio still largely reflects
an emphasis on addressing strategic priorities and rebuilding basic physical, social, and
institutional infrastructure after the damage of 15 years of civil war. The portfolio continues to
suffer from slow disbursements and serious delays, reflecting weak implementation capacity of
most public agencies.
Analytical and advisory services provided by the Bank include support on the overall economic
reform process, assessing poverty, public expenditures, the social security/pension system, and
the agriculture, energy, and water sectors.
As of April 30, 2005, IFC’s held portfolio in Lebanon was $42 million, which included
$35 million in loans, and $1 million in equity. The Corporation’s activities have focused heavily
on the financial sector (mostly credit lines to the Lebanese banks). Due to Lebanon’s
macroeconomic situation and high level of indebtedness, IFC has focused on strengthening its
portfolio and providing technical assistance to the government. In early June 2005, IFC made its
first investment in the Education sector in Lebanon, with a $8 million loan to the Sabis
International School in Adma.
The Bank is maintaining a close dialogue with the Fund on macroeconomic issues, as well as on
statistical issues. The Bank is also collaborating with the Fund to develop an Action Plan
Program on Central Government Debt Management and Domestic Debt Market Development,
upon Lebanon’s request.

APPENDIX III

Lebanon: Statistical Issues
Gaps in the coverage of macroeconomic statistics since the civil war have hampered
effective surveillance. At present, monetary accounts, financial markets data, public debt
statistics, and central government budgetary accounts are available on a regular basis. Most
other data (national accounts, prices, employment, nongovernmental public sector, and
balance of payments) are estimated on the basis of partial information and indicators.
Lebanon participates in the General Data Dissemination Standard (GDDS), and in January,
2003 its metadata were posted on the IMF’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board. Since
then, however, these metadata have not been updated.
The availability of real sector data remains very limited, although there has been
progress in compiling national accounts. The Ministry of Economy and Trade (MoET) is
currently receiving technical assistance from the French National Institute of Statistics and
Economic Studies, for the development of national accounts statistics. The first set of
national accounts estimates for 1997 (the base year) was published in 2003, and the estimates
for 1998–2003 were published in July 2005. Prior to this initiative, official national accounts
statistics had not been produced since the mid-1970s, although preliminary estimates for the
major components of GDP at current prices for the years 1994 and 1995 were published in
October 1997.
No comprehensive official price index is produced. Consumer price indices are prepared
by the MoET and private organizations on the basis of a limited basket of goods for the
greater Beirut metropolitan area. With technical assistance from STA, quarterly price indices
for 1999 were complied using weights from the 1997 household survey. The index was
released in 2000.
Published monthly data on the central government budgetary accounts are not
comprehensive. The published figures do not include certain transfers12 or financing data,
omit foreign-financed capital expenditure, and do not cover arrears. Certain (treasury)
spending is only identified ex-post, and the economic classification of spending is
disseminated with a lag. However, these items are provided to Fund staff in the context of
surveillance activities. No monthly data are available on the consolidated central
government, as available data do not cover the social security funds. No sub-annual fiscal
data are currently reported for publication in International Financial Statistics (IFS).
Cash-based annual government finance statistics, limited to the budgetary central
government, are published in the Government Finance statistics Yearbook (GFSY). The
latest data received for publication in the GFSY are for 2004.

12

These transfers apparently include those to municipalities, subsidies for the state-owned electricity company,
foreign-financed capital expenditure, and payments to service providers (e.g., for waste management and
cleaning services in Beirut).

- 46 -

APPENDIX III

Monetary statistics are generally reliable and usually provided to the Fund on a timely
basis. STA has been able to bridge occasional delays in reporting to IFS by obtaining the
missing data from the Banque du Liban (BdL) website.
Lebanon is participating in the IMF’s Coordinated Compilation Exercise for Financial
Soundness Indicators (FSIs), in which participating countries compile a benchmark set of
FSIs and metadata in accordance with the standards in the Compilation Guide on Financial
Soundness Indicators.
The balance of payments statistics are weak. The data reflect deficiencies in the current
account (unrecorded exports, underestimation of private sector services and workers’
remittances), the capital account (grants), and the financial account (equity investment in the
nonbank private sector, and corporate borrowing abroad). A technical assistance mission
visited the BdL in November 2005 and found limited implementation of the 2002 multisector
mission. It then made the following recommendations: (i) BdL and the Central Authority for
Statistics need to give high priority to extending the existing inter-agency agreement on the
share of work in the data collection and compilation in balance of payments statistics and to
include each agency’s responsibilities with regard to establishing work plans for balance of
payments statistics, allocating resources, and disseminating the statistical results; (ii) new
data sources need to be developed; (iii) the definition for official reserve assets as set out in
the international guidelines should be adopted; and (iv) the periodicity of dissemination of
detailed balance of payments data should be improved to a quarterly frequency.
The statistical base improved with the implementation in 2003 of the International
Transactions Reporting System, developed with technical assistance from STA. In July 2005,
Lebanon provided STA for the first time with data for 2002–04 and with methodological
notes. The data are published in the IFS and the Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV
Consultation with Lebanon
On May 3, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
2006 Article IV consultation with Lebanon.1
Background
Economic developments since 2003 have been shaped by major changes in the political
landscape. Former Prime Minister Hariri’s assassination in February 2005 plunged the country
into a period of political and financial turbulence. Significant deposit withdrawals and a sharp
rise in dollarization put pressure on international reserves, which declined by about $2 billion in
the first quarter of 2005. However, by mid-year, the financial situation had stabilized, and with a
resumption of deposit inflows, liquidity conditions have improved markedly. Upon taking office in
July, Prime Minister Siniora announced that the government would pursue an ambitious
economic reform and adjustment program. However, adoption of the program has been delayed
by renewed political tensions.
GDP growth slowed down considerably in 2005, following a strong showing in 2004. A surge
in tourism and construction activity, and strong exports contributed to increase GDP growth to
6 percent in 2004. In the wake of the political crisis, public and private demand contracted in
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by
the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman
of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to
the country's authorities.
1

-22005, though export growth remained strong. In the event, real GDP is estimated to have grown
by 1 percent, and inflation declined to 0.3 percent in 2005.
Rising oil prices, the economic slowdown, and payments of arrears all weakened public
finances, although a decline in the interest bill helped mitigate these factors, and the overall
fiscal deficit declined slightly to 8 percent of GDP in 2005. Still, the government debt rose to
175 percent of GDP. Part of the cost of financial stabilization in recent years has been absorbed
by the central bank.
The economic slowdown as well as buoyant exports helped narrow the current account deficit to
an estimated 13 percent of GDP in 2005, notwithstanding higher oil prices and losses in
tourism. The negative shock to the financial account of the balance of payments in the first half
of the year was more than offset by the recovery of Foreign Direct Investment and portfolio
inflows in the second half, and by end-2005 gross international reserves were back at their end2004 level.
Moderate progress has been made on the structural reform agenda since 2004. Most public
sector reforms have been of an administrative nature, with a number of legislative proposals
pending in parliament, including those on revenue administration and debt management, laws
to regulate capital markets and bank mergers, as well as competition and domestic market
reform.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed Lebanon’s swift recovery from the financial shock triggered by
Prime Minister Hariri’s assassination in February 2005, and praised the authorities for their
skillful handling of the economy during this period, which helped restore market confidence
by mid-2005.
Directors pointed to recent developments that exposed not only the Lebanese economy’s
resilience to shocks, but also the significant vulnerabilities that need to be addressed. In
particular, they emphasized the risks deriving from the large and growing public debt overhang,
the high degree of dollarization, the large fiscal and current account deficits, and Lebanon’s
reliance on short-term inflows to finance these deficits. While the benign external environment,
ample regional liquidity, and the stability of the depositor base have muted these risks so far,
continued capital inflows are highly dependent on depositor confidence, which may not prevail
indefinitely if reforms are delayed further.
Directors were encouraged by the broad convergence of views on the necessary policy and
institutional reforms, and urged the authorities to seize the opportunity provided by the
restoration of market confidence and the ongoing political transformation to press forward with
these reforms.
Directors supported the authorities’ strategy of debt reduction through sustained fiscal
adjustment to reduce the debt overhang. As regards the pace of fiscal adjustment, many

-3Directors felt that a gradual, sustained fiscal consolidation effort was appropriate. However, a
number of Directors considered that the size of the imbalances called for a more rapid pace of
fiscal consolidation to establish forward momentum and underscore the credibility of the reform
program.
Directors supported the authorities’ view that the required fiscal adjustment necessitated strong
revenue and expenditure measures, backed by institutional reforms to strengthen budgetary
control. On the revenue side, possible measures included an increase in the Value Added Tax
rate, the introduction of a more efficient and progressive income tax system, and a return of the
taxation of gasoline to its 2003 level. On the expenditure side, they saw scope for reducing
non-productive and poorly targeted outlays. Directors urged the authorities to restore the
financial viability of the state electricity company to reduce the associated large drain on the
budget. They also called upon the authorities to correct looming imbalances in pensions and the
social security system.
Directors agreed that a vigorous privatization effort, generous external concessional assistance,
and a voluntary contribution of domestic creditors commensurate with their financial strength
would have to complement fiscal adjustment to accelerate debt reduction. However, even with
an ambitious program in place, it will take several years before Lebanon’s debt-to-GDP ratio
reaches a sustainable level.
Directors agreed that the exchange rate peg remains the appropriate monetary anchor for
Lebanon, and saw no immediate competitiveness problems. The high degree of dollarization
also tended to limit the effectiveness of the exchange rate as a policy tool. They considered that
the current level of international reserves provides a reasonable buffer against liquidity shocks
given the costs of holding reserves.
Directors called on the authorities to establish stricter constraints on central bank financing of
the government and share more evenly the fiscal cost of financial stabilization, not least to
restore the health of the central bank’s balance sheet. Directors noted that the monetary impact
of central bank losses has so far been limited by the buoyant demand for money, but
emphasized that the conduct of monetary policy and the central bank’s capacity to fend off
financial pressures in the event of another financial shock would be much diminished by
continuing losses. Directors also recommended that the central bank re-center its operations on
monetary and liquidity management and unburden its balance sheet of real assets.
Directors underscored that the success of the adjustment strategy depends crucially on
preserving depositor confidence. In this regard, they were encouraged by the high degree of
capitalization and liquidity in the banking system, and welcomed the proactive stance of banking
sector supervision. In this respect, they observed that the regulatory framework could be
reinforced by providing legal protection to supervisors. They also considered it necessary to put
in place a well-functioning deposit guarantee scheme to ensure that the expected consolidation
of the banking system takes place in an orderly, market-based manner. Directors encouraged
the authorities to adopt an independent and strong securities regulator with adequate legal
protection to enhance the stability of the stock market.

-4Directors noted that there is considerable scope to strengthen the environment for private sector
activity, including by enhancing the productivity of government spending, reducing red tape and
corruption, reactivating the liberalization and privatization of the telecom sector, lowering the
high costs of entry and exit, and strengthening contract enforcement. In this regard, Directors
encouraged the authorities to reinvigorate the Paris II structural reform agenda in formulating
their program.

Statement by Shakour Shaalan, Executive Director for Lebanon
May 3, 2006
1.
This year's consultation comes at a time where Lebanon has witnessed events of
unprecedented proportions that have changed in a fundamental way the political and
economic landscape. After 30 years of civil strife and unsettled political situation, Lebanon
has entered a new era that is full with promises but not without risks. The historic events
of 2005, tragic as they are, offer Lebanon a historic opportunity for fundamental reforms on
which the authorities have already embarked. They have formulated a bold and
comprehensive medium-term economic reform program that is now the subject of wide
consultation with domestic and international stakeholders and will be presented to
international donors in the context of the Beirut conference that will take place in the coming
months.
2.
During the past year, the Fund has been very supportive of Lebanon and on behalf of
the Lebanese authorities, we would like to thank management and staff for their continued
constructive dialogue with Lebanon, as well as for highly appreciated technical assistance
support. We would also like to thank staff for a very good set of papers that contain a
well-balanced assessment of the current situation of the Lebanese economy and future
prospects. The Lebanese authorities welcome the staff's assessment that there is a
considerable convergence of views on the reforms that are needed in the years ahead.
Developments in 2005
3.
The Lebanese economy was severely tested in 2005 by a number of adverse
momentous events, foremost of which was the assassination of Prime Minister Hariri in
February. While the economic and financial ramifications of the shock were severe,
especially during the first half of 2005, the economy exhibited a remarkable ability to
weather the impact of the political turmoil, and reverse the initially strong and negative
market reactions. While a surge in capital outflows and dollarization put pressures on the
Lebanese pound and international reserves, swift and decisive actions by the authorities,
contributed to stabilizing the markets by mid-year. These actions included increases in
domestic interest rates and intervention in the foreign exchange market to defend the
currency. By July, capital inflows had resumed, helped by the confidence created by the
formation a new government with wide political support, and were sustained throughout the
remainder of the year resulting in a balance of payments’ surplus of US$747 million by the
end of the year. While interest rates declined to record lows on foreign currency denominated
debt, strong investor’s interest in Eurobonds issues was unabated, with the broadening of the
subscribers’ base beyond dedicated investors as demonstrated in the latest Eurobond
issuances, where international participation reached 50 percent on longer-dated Eurobond
issuances. Furthermore, the process of de-dollarization of deposits was renewed.
4.
The authorities made tremendous efforts in the second half of the year to improve
revenue collection, contain spending, and keep the fiscal position under control. The fiscal
situation started to show signs of recovery after July 2005. Whereas primary expenditures

-2had increased by 6.8 percent during January-July compared to the previous year, they
declined by 4.6 percent in Aug-Dec 2005. Meanwhile, revenues also showed an
improvement of 2 percent during the last five months of 2005 reversing partially the
4 percent decline in the first part of the year. As a result, the primary surplus ended at
2.4 percent despite weak economic activity, reduction in gasoline tax, and most importantly,
the surge in transfers to the national electricity company (EDL) due to higher fuel prices and
continued management and technical problems.
5.
The Ministry of Finance (MOF) pursued a proactive approach at financing and debt
management. In fact, the pre-funding decision taken as soon as the present government came
into power was well received by the market which showed signs of reassurance, mostly
demonstrated through the increased demand witnessed on the Eurobond secondary market
performance and its reflection on decreased secondary market yields to their lowest levels.
As of end April 2006, the Ministry of Finance has financed two-third of the domestic
currency principal payments due for the year and has exchanged 70 percent of the Eurobond
principal payments for 2006. It is worth noting that 2006 was one of the most difficult years
in terms of financing, most specifically the period extending from January-April 2006.
Major Elements of the Reform Program
6.
Despite the fact that the Lebanese economy has so far withstood shocks and averted
major crises, the authorities are keenly aware of the need to address key vulnerabilities, most
notably the worsening debt dynamics. Consequently, they have set up a high-level economic
team mandated to prepare a medium-term economic program that addresses these
vulnerabilities and promotes the economy’s growth potential. The objectives of this program
are to raise the growth rate to 5-6 percent, promote job creation, reduce poverty, and improve
social indicators. The preparation of the multi-pronged program has benefited from broad
consultations at the domestic level, as well as with international financial organizations and
donors.
A. Fiscal Policy
7.
The fiscal adjustment pillar of the authorities’ program is broadly consistent with the
staff’s adjustment scenario. There is broad agreement on the overall magnitude of the
necessary adjustment in the primary surplus over the medium term, and on the nature of the
measures to achieve the target. The differences lie in the timing and sequencing of the policy
actions, where the authorities take account of the political reality on the ground and of the
impact of a severe and too frontloaded adjustment on economic activities and growth at a
time when the country has begun to pick the pieces from the events of 2005. The core
revenue measures consist of a VAT increase of 2 to 3 percentage points in 2006 reaching the
overall rate of 15 percent (from the present 10 percent level) by 2008, an increase in the tax
on interest rates on interest income, the introduction of a global income tax, the lifting of the
cap on gasoline prices, and a gradual increase in the excise tax to pre-cap levels. These
measures will be accompanied, between 2006 and 2008, by structural measures to
substantially reform tax administration.

-38.
Revenue measures will be complemented by decisive action on the expenditure side.
The government’s plan emphasizes the rationalization of current expenditures, including
through a reduction in transfers to public sector entities, and the containment of the wage bill
over the medium term through limiting government hiring, freezing wages in real terms,
reviewing the salary and benefit structure in some public entities including for current and
former members of parliament, reducing waste in the public sector, and closing the Fund for
the displaced and the Council of the South. Of critical importance is the need to strengthen
public expenditure management, and improve transparency and accountability in the budget
process. The MOF has developed, with the Fund’s assistance, an action plan for public
financial management reform, with a clear time-bound outline of measures. The government
also plans to adopt a Fiscal Accountability Act and a new Public Procurement Law, and
intends to strengthen the financial control of state-owned enterprises.
9.
The government is establishing a comprehensive strategy to deal with the EDL,
given the deep-rooted and complex problems of this sector. Short-term initiatives include
negotiating new fuel and gas supply contracts to reduce the premium on imports, reducing
losses by improving metering, cracking down on illegal networks, and increasing collection
rates with the support of the justice and security services. Selected tariff increases may also
be considered. The implementation of the EDL plan is estimated to generate savings in the
order of 2 to 3 percent of GDP over the medium term, and is considered a critical element to
the fiscal adjustment process. A special cabinet session was held recently to discuss the
reform plan of EDL to be followed by other sessions.
10.
The coordination between the BDL and the MOF has substantially improved recently,
as the staff report indicates. In this context, the MOF has agreed to refrain from central bank
borrowing, and to repay its maturing obligations rather than roll them over. In fact, the
Ministry of Finance repaid US$2.9 billion worth of LL TBs to the BDL for the period of
June 2005 till March 2006, slashing BDL’s portfolio by 33 percent. There has been a
convergence of views on the appropriate level of international reserves, and better
coordination between the two institutions regarding the timing and maturities of their
respective debt instruments. The implementation of a clearer division of labor between the
institutions has improved with the regular meetings at the senior level of officials of the two
institutions under the aegis of the Prime Minister.
B. Privatization
11.
The government aims to proceed with privatization of major public sector entities, not
only to strengthen public finances and reduce debt, but also to improve efficiency in the
delivery of services, reduce the cost of doing business, improve competitiveness, and foster
growth. The privatization effort includes the telecommunication and energy sectors, and
assets under the control of the BDL. The government is finalizing the appointment of the
Board of the new Telecommunication Regulatory Authority, ahead of the privatization of the
two existing mobile licenses at the end of the year. A hiring of a financial advisor to specify
pre-qualification criteria and request expression of interest will follow. Fixed line operator
Liban Telecom is expected to follow suit in 2007 and a third mobile license is expected to be
sold in 2008-09, in the context of a comprehensive strategy for the sector. Regarding EDL,

-4after completion of steps outlined above, and the appointment of the regulatory agency, the
selection of strategic investors and privatization will proceed.
12.
The central bank successfully restructured and executed the sale of the commercial
bank it owned (BLC) to Gulf investors. This transaction reflected a strong interest in the Gulf
in investment opportunities in Lebanon and the substantial increase in oil revenue in the
region on account of high oil prices, and an inflow of close to US$1 billion came to the
Beirut Stock Exchange (BSE), essentially into banks’ shares. The increase in banks' capital
reflects also the decision of BDL to move to Basil II capital adequacy ratios. The BDL is
considering the sale of the shares it holds, including Middle East Airlines and Intra
Investment Company, which will contribute to strengthening its own financial position, while
stimulating activity in the capital markets.
C. Capital Markets
13.
The Lebanese authorities consider financial sector reforms as a major pillar in the
reform strategy, as developed capital markets are necessary to diversify the financial sector in
view of the relative size of the banking sector and the stock exchange. Major strides were
made over the past few months in order to deepen further capital markets, attracting longer
term capital to the country, and diversifying risks, most notably through the issuance of
Lebanon’s first longer dated bond—5 years in Lebanese Pounds—as a new benchmark
instrument, in accordance with international practice. The Securitization Law, which was
waiting approval by Parliament since 1999, was enacted on December 9, 2005. By enabling
institutions to securitize assets, the law introduces adequate long-term investment
instruments to such institutions as pension funds and insurance companies which hold longterm liabilities. In the same vein, the Investment Fund law, enacted in December 2005,
provides the enabling environment for marketing and operating collective investment
schemes, including the protection of depositors’ assets. The Capital Market Law, which
provides a framework for the regulation and development of capital markets in Lebanon,
including through the establishment of an independent regulatory body, the Capital Market
Council, was approved by the Cabinet in March 2006 and awaits Parliament ratification.
14.
The authorities acknowledge that more remains to be done to promote a
well-functioning capital market. They agree that developing a secondary market for fixedincome instruments and removing obstacles to the development of the insurance sector and
other institutional investors, in line with staff recommendations, remain a priority. Several
steps were undertaken in this direction, including the following draft legislations that await
Parliament approval: the law on Dematerialization of Securities, the Securities Lending law,
the Insider Trading law, improvements to the Bank Mergers law, and the Insurance
Regulatory Commission law.
D. Growth and Competitiveness
15.
The private sector remains the backbone of the Lebanese economy and the main
engine of growth. As the Selected Issues paper indicates, although available macroeconomic
indicators suggest that competitiveness is not an immediate concern, Lebanon’s
competitiveness could significantly benefit over the medium-term from improvements in the

-5business environment. While a number of steps were implemented in recent years to
eliminate administrative and legal bottlenecks, the authorities are cognizant that further
efforts remain to be undertaken in this regard. The authorities’ reform program envisages
several measures to facilitate the conduct of business, including the simplification of the tax
code, streamlining administrative procedures, and easing restrictions on entry and exit. Also,
work on legislative reform to modernize and improve the legal framework is ongoing. A new
consumer protection law was already ratified by parliament, a WTO compatible antidumping law and a basket of E-commerce laws are awaiting ratification, and a modern
competition law is currently being finalized. Support of small and medium-term enterprises
(SMEs) is also a priority, and an SME unit and a guarantee fund to facilitate access to credit
were already set up. Furthermore, trade liberalization remains a core element of the
government’s policy, and Lebanon is steadily advancing toward membership in WTO. It also
has recently committed to the European Neighborhood policy which would further enhance
harmonization of standards and regulations with those of the EU.
E. Social Sector
16.
The authorities are mindful of the effects of the adjustment strategy on lower income
groups and are developing a comprehensive medium term social strategy to be finalized
in 2006. This will involve the establishment of an Interministerial Committee for Social
Development Policy to monitor, coordinate and implement the new strategy, and reduce
overlap in the provision of social services. In line with this effort, the Pension System is
being reformed with assistance of the World Bank. The aim will be to put the system on a
financially sound and sustainable basis and a special cabinet session was held recently to
discuss the reform of the National Social Security Fund (NSSF). The reforms will also aim at
preserving the acquired rights while relieving fiscal burdens, promoting equity and social
protection, and paving the way for a more flexible labor market as the private scheme
restricts labor mobility. Moreover, the social safety nets will be strengthened and expanded,
and the health and education sectors will be enhanced, to insure affordability, improve
quality, and ultimately achieve universal coverage.
International Support
17.
The authorities are committed to the implementation of the comprehensive strategy
contained in their reform program. However, notwithstanding the strong fiscal adjustment
and structural reforms that are embedded in the program to bring down significantly the debt
to GDP ratio, the debt dynamics will remain fragile and vulnerabilities will remain high. In
view of the necessity to bring the debt to GDP ratio significantly below the adjustment
scenario level of 133 percent in 2011, and the exposure of the financial system to the
sovereign, the authorities intend to request concessional financial support from the
international community in the context of an international conference to be held in Beirut.
18.
International financial support will ease the pains of adjustment and will help the
authorities sustain their reform efforts in the years ahead. It is worth noting that the
authorities undertook a substantial domestic adjustment effort during 2000-04. Most notably,
on the fiscal side, the primary balance shifted from a deficit of 7.6 percent of GDP in 2000 to
a surplus of 3.4 percent in 2004, an impressive adjustment of about 11 percent of GDP.

-6Furthermore, the central bank increased its gross reserves from US$5.9 billion at end-2000 to
US$9.5 billion at end-2004, thereby strengthening overall confidence in the economy.
19.
Concessional assistance would contribute significantly to reducing the debt level.
Staff calculations indicate that, for every US$1 billion of grant-equivalent support in 2006,
the debt ratio would be reduced by about 5.7 percentage points by 2011. The indirect positive
effects of such assistance would also be much larger as the confidence generated would have
critical implications for boosting investments, lowering interest rates, and providing a
positive stimulus to market participants and expectations, which would translate into
significantly higher growth rates. These effects on confidence and growth were indeed
clearly observed after the Paris-II conference that was convened in November 2002. The
authorities expect that, with such donor support, the growth rate levels achieved in 2004 (of
about 6 percent) could be easily reached and exceeded, and that for every percentage point
increase in the growth rate, the debt-to-GDP ratio would decline by about 1.7 percentage
point. Similarly, a one percentage point decline in the interest rate would lead to an equal
decline in the debt ratio. Therefore, in order to decisively reverse the debt dynamics and
break the vicious circle of high deficit and high debt ratios, domestic reforms would need to
be complemented with sizeable financial support from the international community.
Preparations are under way for the holding of a conference in Beirut in the coming months to
solicit such support.
Conclusion
20.
In conclusion, the Lebanese authorities have undertaken significant adjustment efforts
over the past few years, which have allowed the Lebanese economy to avoid crises despite
major shocks. They highly appreciate the continued support Lebanon has received from the
Fund. They are keenly aware that key vulnerabilities remain, and have decided to embark on
a major adjustment effort to address these vulnerabilities in a decisive manner with the
support of the international community.
