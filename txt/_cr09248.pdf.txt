EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Following a prolonged expansion, reflecting sound macroeconomic policies and
favorable terms of trade, global events have slowed Australia’s economic growth well
below trend. Declining commodity prices, tightening credit conditions in global capital
markets, and slowing world growth have reduced activity. However, the downturn has been
milder than in most other advanced countries. This is because of strong commodity exports, a
flexible exchange rate, a healthy banking sector, and a timely and significant policy response.
The near-term outlook for growth is weak and highly uncertain. Aggressive policy
action is expected to limit the decline in real activity to ½ percent in 2009, despite lower
commodity income and rising unemployment. Growth is projected to pick up to about
1½ percent in 2010, led by government spending. Uncertainty about the strength and timing
of the recovery in Australia’s trading partners poses the main risk in the outlook.
The easing of monetary policy since late 2008 was appropriate, as is the current stance of
monetary policy. The substantial stimulus in train, and signs of recovery in consumer and
business confidence, should help support domestic demand. However, staff and the
authorities agreed that if the outlook for growth and inflation weakens, there is scope to cut
the policy rate further.

The sizable fiscal stimulus underway will continue to boost activity. In addition to the
stimulus measures, the weaker outlook for growth and commodity prices is projected to shift
the underlying cash balance into a deficit of almost 5 percent of GDP in 2009/10. Staff and
authorities agreed that, given the low level of public debt, there is scope for further fiscal
stimulus, if the outlook for growth weakens. However, staff advised that monetary policy
should be the first line of defense, as it remains effective.
Staff welcomed the authorities’ objective to return to budget surpluses over the
medium-term. The authorities agreed that if trend growth or the terms of trade are not as
high as assumed in the budget, further restraint on spending would be needed to return to
surpluses over a horizon consistent with the authorities’ objective.
Australia’s banks have coped well with the turmoil so far, largely because of robust
supervision and regulation. Banks remained profitable and raised private equity capital in
early 2009, but were exposed to significant risks from sizable short-term wholesale funding.
The introduction of the wholesale funding and retail deposit guarantees and RBA actions to
provide sufficient liquidity helped maintain financial sector stability.
Staff commended the authorities’ plan to undertake further stress tests for banks, and
advised the use of more extreme stress scenarios than in the 2006 FSAP. Staff’s
preliminary analysis suggests that potential losses from a sizable downside shock would not
reduce the capital of large banks below the regulatory minimum. Staff also welcomed the
authorities’ ongoing work on crisis preparedness that will help strengthen financial stability.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Australia was in a strong economic position at the onset of the global recession.
Sound macroeconomic policies and structural reforms, together with a stable external
environment, delivered 17 years of continuous economic growth. National income was
boosted in recent years by a commodity price boom, which pushed the terms of trade to its
highest level in more than half a century. The expansion reduced unemployment to historical
lows, but put pressure on prices as productive capacity became stretched. The
Commonwealth government had eliminated its net debt, and corporate and bank leverage
were relatively low.
2.
The turmoil sparked by the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 had
an immediate impact on Australian markets. Key commodity prices fell sharply, domestic
money markets came under stress, and offshore funding tightened. As a result, the currency
depreciated and equity prices plunged.
3.
However, the crisis has not hit real activity in Australia as hard as in many other
advanced economies. In part, this reflects limited higher-tech manufacturing and robust
commodity exports to China.
4.
Economic activity was also shielded by the authorities’ timely and significant
policy response. Monetary policy remains effective, as large cuts in the policy rate passed
through to lending rates, while the sound banking system helped avoid a sharp contraction of
credit. The flexible exchange rate has provided a buffer for export incomes. In addition, a
sizable fiscal stimulus is being delivered, supporting domestic demand.
5.
Nonetheless, the crisis highlighted some vulnerabilities and the near-term
outlook remains highly uncertain. Both household debt (at over 150 percent of disposable
income in 2008) and short-term external borrowing (at over 50 percent of GDP in 2008) are
high by advanced country standards. Unemployment has increased, but less so than in many
other advanced countries.

Economic growth has slowed as a result of the crisis. Real GDP growth eased to
2.3 percent in 2008 and 1½ percent in 2009 Q1 (saar), well below trend (text figure, Figure 2,
Table 1). Negative wealth effects from

On the production side, manufacturing
value added fell sharply, as in many
advanced countries, but with manufacturing comprising less than one-tenth of total output,
the hit to overall GDP growth was less than elsewhere. Recently, consumer and business
confidence measures showed signs of a recovery, but investment intentions remain weak.
8.
Capacity pressures have abated and inflation has moderated quickly, to within
the policy target band. After increasing steadily since 2000, capacity utilization declined
sharply over the last year, and the unemployment rate rose by almost 2 percentage points
from its trough in early 2008 (Figure 3). Prices have responded quickly, with headline,
nontradables, and tradables inflation decelerating markedly. Moreover, upward pressure on
tradables prices from currency depreciation was more than offset by lower energy prices and
growing spare capacity. Headline CPI inflation, at 1½ percent year-on-year in the June
quarter, is now below the Reserve Bank of Australia’s (RBA) target band of 2–3 percent
inflation, on average, over the cycle. Inflation expectations reacted swiftly to the sharp
turnaround and wage demands showed signs of moderating.
9.
The RBA cut its policy rate sharply as the outlook weakened. Since September
2008, the RBA reduced the policy rate by 425 basis points to 3 percent. Most of this fall has
been reflected in floating mortgage interest rates, which apply to the bulk of Australian
mortgages (Figure 4). Business lending rates have also fallen markedly, but by about
150 basis points less than the cash rate.

Credit growth has slowed in recent months reflecting both demand and supply
factors. Mortgage rate reductions and a temporary increase in the first-time homebuyers’
subsidy underpinned demand for housing credit, but business and other personal credit
growth contracted (text figures). Households and businesses are pulling back on spending
plans, while banks have tightened their credit standards. Household debt-to-income has
declined slightly since mid-2008, but the household debt-service ratio has fallen further
because of the large drop in mortgage interest rates.

Banks were in a healthy position at the onset of the turmoil. They reported strong
profit growth before the crisis hit, with returns on equity of 15–20 percent (Figure 5). A
conservative approach by regulators and supervisors meant that banks had relatively low
leverage and high capital adequacy ratios, with Tier 1 capital ratios of 7–8 percent in 2007.
Moreover, the “four-pillar policy,” which does not allow the four large banks to merge,
played a role in limiting risky behavior. Asset quality of smaller banks is somewhat weaker
than that of the large banks, but these banks still appear sound. 1 Banks had limited exposure
to securitized assets and investment vehicles holding structured finance products in Australia
and overseas. 2

12.
Although bank asset quality is declining, capital buffers are being increased. Past
due loans and impaired assets have risen, but only to 1½ percent of assets in March 2009, and
profitability has fallen, reflecting increased provisioning for bad debt. Most importantly, even
in the midst of the crisis, large banks have been able to raise common equity from private
investors and strengthen their capital positions in anticipation of further bad loans. This has
improved their Tier 1 capital ratios to over 8 percent. 3
13.
On the liability side, the swift introduction of deposit and wholesale funding
guarantees helped maintain confidence in banks. About half of banks’ funding comes
from the wholesale market, and access was disrupted after the Lehman collapse. The
establishment of wholesale funding guarantees in October 2008 enabled banks to raise
$A 140 billion in longer-term funding in the subsequent seven months. However, rollover
risks remain. Staff estimate that financial institutions’ short-term external debt (on a residual
maturity basis) was about $A 400 billion (35 percent of GDP) in March 2009. The authorities
also introduced the Financial Claims Scheme in October 2008 that provided a guarantee for
retail deposits up to $A 1 million (see Appendix I for details).
14.
The broader financial sector was hit hard by the crisis. Securitization activity fell
sharply after the initial turmoil in 2007, and effectively shutdown post Lehman, with very
little activity in recent months (text figure). The dislocation of securitization markets resulted
in greater concentration of lending with the four large banks. The fall in equity prices
reduced returns at superannuation and managed funds, contributing to a fall in household
financial assets by more than 60 percent of household disposable income in 2008 (text
figure), while general insurers’ profits declined owing to more difficult underwriting
conditions.

2.7 percent of GDP is estimated, as the
downturn hit tax revenues and the government implemented stimulus measures (Table 2,
Figure 6). In addition, states and public corporations continued to increase their investment
spending, which pushed the consolidated nonfinancial public sector deficit to 5¾ percent of
GDP in 2008/09 (Figure 6).
16.
The current account deficit narrowed to close to 4 percent of GDP in 2008. The
improvement reflected large increases in commodity contract prices negotiated in early 2008
for iron ore and coal exports (Figure 7). These contracts are being renegotiated with prices
expected to fall by 30–60 percent, bringing them back to just over 2007 levels. The income
deficit declined because of a fall in interest and dividend payments to foreign investors. As a
result, the current account deficit narrowed further in 2009 Q1 to less than 2 percent of GDP.
Recently, the deficit has been financed by a more balanced mix of equity and debt inflows
than in the past five years. Net foreign liabilities stabilized at about 60 percent of GDP over
the past two years.

15
A. The Outlook
18.
The near-term outlook for growth is weak. Aggressive policy action is expected to
limit the decline in activity to ½ percent in 2009. Staff’s baseline forecast envisages a
contraction in domestic demand as external shocks spill over into consumption and
investment. Rising unemployment, low asset prices, high debt levels will weigh on
household spending plans, despite lower interest rates. As a result, private consumption is
projected to be stagnant. Private investment is expected to fall sharply, as corporate
profitability is affected by the fall in demand and lower commodity export prices.
19.
The recovery will likely be slow. Growth is projected to reach 1½ percent in 2010,
led by government spending on infrastructure, as households and businesses continue to
deleverage. Output will likely remain below potential in coming years. This will reduce core
inflation and raise the unemployment rate to 7½ percent in 2011. The current account is
projected to remain in deficit, with net foreign liabilities relative to GDP rising, as Australia
will remain an attractive destination for foreign investment, especially in the resource sector.
20.
Staff projects a lower level of potential output as a result of the global recession.
By 2014, GDP is projected to be about 5 percent lower than implied by the precrisis trend
(Figure 8). This loss results from weaker export prospects and higher cost of capital, but it is
substantially less than losses projected for most other advanced countries. In part, this
reflects high investment in the resource sector in recent years that will increase productivity
over the medium-term as projects come on stream. Moreover, despite the fall in export prices
this year, the terms of trade is projected by staff to remain more than 40 percent above the
average for the 1990s, because of demand for commodities from fast-growing Asian
economies.
21.
The risks are evenly balanced, but the outlook is highly uncertain. On the
downside, the world economy could take longer to recover, with significant spillovers to
Australia through commodity sector incomes, external demand, and international capital
markets. Domestically, a sharper-than-expected deterioration in banks’ asset quality, possibly
stemming from lower house prices, could constrain credit and deepen the downturn. A highimpact tail risk would be a decline of investor confidence in banks or the sovereign.
However, this is highly unlikely given low public debt and Australia’s track record of sound
macroeconomic policies. On the upside, a key risk is stronger-than-expected demand from
China. A further upside risk is that domestic and foreign economies could be more
responsive than expected to the considerable policy stimulus currently in place.

22.
The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s views on the near-term outlook and
risks, but they considered staff’s medium-term growth projections too pessimistic. The
latest official projections (May 2009 Budget) show a faster recovery, with growth reaching
4½ percent by 2011/12 and a smaller permanent output loss in the medium term. They argue
that potential growth will not fall significantly given the absence of a domestic banking crisis,
robust demand for commodities, and high immigration expected over the next few years.
B. Monetary Policy
23.
Staff and the authorities agreed the current stance of monetary policy is
appropriate, as earlier cuts in the policy rate will continue to support domestic demand.
The RBA has kept rates on hold in recent months given the substantial fiscal and monetary
stimulus in train and signs of a recovery in consumer and business confidence. The policy
rate is currently below that implied by a simple Taylor Rule and staff’s forecast for inflation
in 2010 is just under 2 percent.

17
24.
If the outlook for growth and inflation worsens, staff and the authorities
concurred that there is ample scope for further cuts in the policy rate. A downside
scenario of lower global demand and higher risk premia on Australian assets would spill over
to the domestic economy through weaker commodity prices, growth, and inflation (Box 1).
In this scenario, a cut in the policy rate and a depreciation of the currency would ease
financial conditions and cushion the impact on Australia.

25.
The authorities agreed with staff on the need to be more cautious than normal in
tightening in view of the fragile state of the global economy. Although the risk of deflation
is more limited in Australia than elsewhere, the associated output costs could be severe.
Therefore, the return of the cash rate to neutral should wait until there are clear signs that a
sustainable recovery is underway.
26.
The monetary transmission mechanism has not been impaired in Australia and
staff and authorities considered that unconventional monetary policy measures are
unlikely to be needed. Nonetheless, staff suggested that the authorities consider how such
measures could be implemented if required. Some measures have been taken already to help
resuscitate residential mortgage back securities (RMBS) and asset backed commercial paper
(ABCP) markets, with government planning to buy about $A 8 billion in RMBS securities. 4
27.
The authorities and staff agreed that the inflation-targeting framework provides
a robust nominal anchor. Over the last several years, which witnessed the largest boom in
Australia’s commodity prices in half a century, wage growth remained relatively stable,
suggesting well-anchored medium-term inflation expectations. Moreover, the flexibility
embodied in the target of 2–3 percent inflation, on average, over the cycle has allowed the
RBA to take a wide range of factors into

The stock of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) and asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP)
outstanding was about $A 160 billion in March 2009, about 40 percent below the peak of mid 2007, but is small
compared with total financial sector credit of $A 1,900 billion.

18
Box 1. Australia: Slower World Recovery
The IMF’s Global Integrated Monetary and Fiscal Model (GIMF) has been used to estimate the
impact on Australia of a slower-than-expected world recovery. In this scenario, shocks to
investment and consumption are used to proxy an intensification of the global financial crisis. The
shocks reduce growth in the world outside Australia by roughly 2 percentage points in each of the
first three years. This weaker growth is assumed to increase home bias in investment and
consumption goods outside Australia. Smaller shocks to investment and consumption are also applied
to Australia. In addition, the scenario assumes a temporary increase in Australia’s currency risk
premium of almost 200 basis points, with half of that flowing through to Australian market interest
rates.
The shock reduces the level of real GDP in Australia by 3 percent after three years. In addition
to the direct impact of weaker external demand, slower world growth reduces commodity prices by
roughly 20 percent, lowering private incomes and weakening domestic demand in Australia.
However, the impact on the Australian dollar price of commodities is buffered by depreciation in the
real exchange rate. With weaker growth reducing inflation, the policy rate declines by almost
300 basis points. In part, the large policy rate cut is necessary because a portion of the cut is not
passed through to lending rates owing to a rise in the risk premium. Assuming that nominal
government spending remains at baseline, but that revenues decline with nominal GDP, the fiscal
balance moves into deficit for five years, driving government debt up by almost 7 percent of GDP at
its peak.

29.
Staff commended the quick implementation of fiscal stimulus and noted that the
shift into deficit was justified in current circumstances. Staff estimates suggest that the
stimulus will raise real GDP by about 3 percent relative to baseline in 2009 and 2010, before
dissipating in outer years. 5 The transfers to households had an immediate impact on activity
that helped underpin confidence. The increase in public investment will continue to support
activity in the near term, while addressing infrastructure shortfalls. The stimulus payments to
state governments are also in line with the Commonwealth and State governments’ reform
agenda that focuses on investing in education, health and transportation infrastructure to raise
productivity while harmonizing regulations across states.
30.
Staff and authorities agreed that, given low public debt, there is scope for further
fiscal stimulus, if the outlook for growth weakens. However, staff advised that monetary
policy should be the first line of defense, as it remains effective and because additional fiscal
stimulus would increase government debt further. If growth were slower than expected in the
near-term, automatic fiscal stabilizers should be allowed to work fully. Staff analysis suggests
that the impact on growth is highest for public investment spending. However, transfers
targeted to low-income households have a faster yet still large impact, and could be the most
suitable measure if a prompt demand impetus is required.

Using the IMF’s GIMF model, the accompanying Selected Issues paper evaluates the impact of the fiscal
stimulus on GDP. Alternative calibrations of the model give a range for the cumulative impact on GDP of 5¼–
12¾ percent over the five years 2008–12.

31.
The authorities’ reaffirmed their medium-term fiscal strategy that focuses on
three objectives:




achieving budget surpluses, on average, over the medium term;
keeping Commonwealth tax revenue as a share of GDP, on average, below the
2007/08 level (24.6 percent); and
improving the government’s net financial worth over the medium term.

32.
The government has adopted a deficit exit strategy consistent with its broad
medium-term fiscal objectives. Once GDP is growing above its trend rate, the authorities
intend to take action to return the budget to surplus by limiting real growth in spending to
2 percent per year and allowing tax receipts to increase through fiscal drag. Based on the
authorities’ growth projections, the underlying budget balance would return to surplus by
2015/16 and remain in surplus through 2019/20. As a result, Commonwealth government net
debt would peak at almost 14 percent of GDP in 2013/14 before falling below 4 percent of
GDP by 2019/20. 6 The authorities consider that the increase in net debt is prudent in the
current economic circumstances, as net debt is projected to remain low relative to both the
peak of the past 40 years (18½ percent of GDP) and to other advanced economies.
33.
Staff welcomed the authorities’ fiscal strategy and the intention to return to
surpluses in the medium term. Staff projects a return to surpluses by 2017/2018, assuming
a lower GDP growth rate than the authorities but that their spending plans are maintained. On
this basis, staff projects Commonwealth government net debt to be peak at about 15 percent
in 2013/14 before falling to 10 percent of GDP by 2019/20. While the staff’s projected
increase in debt is somewhat higher than projected by the authorities, it is less than expected
for many other advanced countries. This would leave Australia in an enviable fiscal position
by international standards (Figure 10).
34.
Staff welcomed plans to contain expenditure and allow tax receipts to increase,
but noted that further fiscal adjustment may be needed. The current global environment
implies considerable uncertainty about Australia’s medium-term prospects. If trend growth or
the terms of trade are not as high as assumed, government revenue would be negatively
impacted. In such circumstances, further fiscal adjustment would be needed to return to

6

This strategy is consistent with the Charter of Budget Honesty, which requires the government to specify
“fiscal policy actions that are temporary in nature, adopted for the purpose of moderating cyclical fluctuations
in economic activity, and indicate the process for their reversal.” The Charter was introduced into law in 1998
and does not prescribe quantified fiscal targets, which are laid out separately in the Government’s fiscal
strategy. The Charter requires government “to manage financial risks faced by the Commonwealth prudently,
having regard to economic circumstances, including by maintaining Commonwealth general government debt at
prudent levels.”

surpluses at a horizon consistent with the government’s medium-term objective. In particular,
the growth of real spending would need to be constrained below the 2 percent annual rate
envisaged in the budget, once growth has recovered. Staff advised that if revenue is higher
than currently expected, the authorities should strive for an earlier return to surpluses.
35.
Although government debt is projected to remain relatively low, several factors
argue for continued prudence. While the probability is extremely low, the government may
need to assume additional debt on behalf of the banks should they be unable to rollover their
significant short-term external liabilities. Guarantees on banks’ deposits and wholesale
funding as well as state-government debt, presents an additional, although again similarly
low probability risk. Relatedly, servicing government debt could become more expensive if
increased global supply drives up sovereign debt yields, as seen in recent months. Returning
to lower debt levels would put Australia on a firmer footing to respond to future shocks.
Looking further out, while some pension and health care reform has been included in the

23
budget, remaining longer-term pressures from aging and rising health care costs argue for
more policy action.
36.
State governments are projecting higher cash deficits and increased debt levels.
Staff noted that this highlights the importance of maintaining fiscal restraint at the
Commonwealth level over the medium term, given the new guarantee of state debt.
37.
The authorities reiterated their commitment to maintaining debt at prudent
levels over the medium term. They considered that the downside risks to revenue were
limited, but stated that they would cut expenditure if necessary to achieve their medium-term
fiscal objectives. Should revenue exceed budget projections, they would save excess revenue
to return to surpluses earlier than envisaged.
D. Domestic Macro-Financial Linkages and Preserving Financial Stability
38.
The linkages between high household debt and bank balance sheets are a key
domestic vulnerability. Australian household debt is relatively high by advanced country
standards and staff analysis suggests that house prices are overvalued by 0–20 percent. 7 A
fall in house prices and a jump in unemployment could lead to further household
deleveraging and an increase in bank’s impaired assets. In turn, higher provisioning for
losses could constrain bank credit growth and deepen the downturn. However, the risks of a
sharp fall in house prices is limited given strong immigration flows and improved
affordability because of lower mortgage rates. Moreover, less than 10 percent of owneroccupiers with mortgages belong to the high risk group––those with a debt-service ratio over
30 percent and a loan-to-value ratio greater than 80 percent. Staff’s preliminary analysis
suggests that potential further losses from a sizeable downside shock that would increase
mortgage and corporate defaults sharply would not reduce large banks’ capital below the
regulatory minimum. 8
39.
Staff commended the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) for
regularly stress testing the banking sector and advised that banks be required to
undertake more extreme stress tests than in the past. The tests should be undertaken
jointly with their subsidiaries, to assess vulnerability of their capital and liquidity positions to
a sharp jump in unemployment, a drop in house and commodity prices, and a disruption to

24
wholesale funding. 9 Prudential judgment should be used to assess adequacy of banks’ capital
buffers, in light of stress tests, and capital requirements raised if necessary.
40.
The authorities reiterated their commitment to continue monitoring and stress
testing banks’ capital position. They noted that banks are now required to conduct regular
stress tests under Basel II. Moreover, a recent mission from the IMF’s Monetary and Capital
Markets Department gave a very positive assessment of Australia’s Basel II implementation
(Box 2).
41.
The planned introduction of new liquidity guidelines is welcome. Recognizing the
increased importance of liquidity and rollover risks associated with short-term liabilities,
banks have started to increase medium-term funding. However, liquidity positions should
continue to be based on prudentially enforced liquidity guidelines. The stability benefits of
strengthening liquidity positions and reducing rollover risks justify likely increases in
funding costs.
42.
Staff underlined the importance of further crisis preparedness planning,
especially for liquidity or solvency problems in major banks in Australia and
New Zealand. Staff welcomed ongoing close cooperation with New Zealand authorities,
including the visit by APRA to New Zealand in February 2009 for on-site credit book
inspections of the large banks. Most importantly, a framework is being developed for
resolving stress in an Australian or New Zealand bank.
43.
Exit strategies from policy measures introduced during the financial crisis are,
appropriately, being considered. Staff recognized that the risk-pricing element of the
wholesale funding guarantee provides a natural exit strategy once markets normalize. The
authorities plan to review options for guarantees to retail deposits, including changes to the
new Financial Claims Scheme that covers deposits of less than a million dollars. Key
recommendations of the 2006 FSAP have been implemented, as summarized in Appendix II.

9

The stress tests should take account of possible spillovers from New Zealand and United Kingdom
subsidiaries of Australian banks that are equivalent to about ⅓ of Australian GDP (mostly in New Zealand).
Australian banks have limited exposure to the U.S., Euro area, and the rest of the world. A Selected Issues paper
for the 2009 New Zealand Article IV consultation examined the vulnerabilities of the four large Australian bank
subsidiaries operating in New Zealand (IMF Country Report No. 09/146, May 2009). The paper concluded that
a sharp worsening of asset quality would be needed to reduce bank capital below the regulatory minimum.
While such a large increase in defaults is unlikely, the risks of such an outcome have jumped in the past year as
the outlook for the global and local economies has worsened.

25

Box 2. Australia: Basel II Implementation
The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) implemented the Basel II
framework in 2008. The major banks, representing nearly 70 percent of banking industry
assets, adopted the advanced approaches for credit, market and operational risk. At the
request of the authorities, an IMF mission from the Monetary and Capital Markets
Department visited Sydney in May 2009 to assess Basel II implementation. This box
summarizes the assessment of the mission.
The mission found that APRA followed a rigorous process in implementing the Basel
II framework. APRA has allocated sufficient resources prior to the Basel II start date and
the outcome has been robust implementation. The mission noted that adequate resources
will be needed to ensure that banks continue to meet these requirements on an ongoing
basis.
The authorities adopted a more conservative approach in several cases than required
by the Basel II framework. Most importantly, a 20 percent loss given default (LGD)
floor was adopted for residential mortgages that comprise over half of the large banks’
loans, which is higher than the Basel II 10 percent floor. In addition, higher risk weights
were required for certain residential mortgages under the standardized approach.
Moreover, reduced risk weights, which are permissible in the Basel II framework’s
standardized approach, have not been introduced for retail lending. Furthermore, banks’
capital requirements under the advanced approaches continue to be subject to the
90 percent floor of the Basel I capital requirement, instead of the 80 percent floor
applicable in the second year. APRA has also exercised caution in other choices regarding
the framework, such as requiring banks using the advanced approaches to hold capital
against interest rate risk in the banking book.
The mission pointed to few areas where APRA could build on initiatives already
underway to enhance its supervision of banks’ risk management. APRA should
continue to undertake increasingly complex work, such as drill down reviews of banks’
economic capital models and stress testing practices. The mission recommended increased
Pillar 3 disclosures by second-tier banks and a re-assessment of the operational risk
approach applicable to their operations.

26
E. Australia’s External Vulnerability
44.
A range of indicators suggest that the currency is broadly in line with
fundamentals (Box 3). The fall of the exchange rate from mid 2008 to early 2009 was
driven by a decline in commodity prices and the loosening of monetary policy (Figure 11).
The currency is free floating and fluctuates considerably because of the importance of
commodity exports. The authorities agreed that the currency is broadly in line with
fundamentals.
45.
Staff forecasts the current account deficit to be around 3½ percent of GDP in
2009. The trade deficit is expected to narrow slightly in 2009, as the decline in the terms of
trade is offset by lower imports and continued strong commodity export volumes. The
income balance is projected to narrow by about ½ percent of GDP in 2009 because of lower
interest and dividend payments. The current account deficit is forecast to be around the lower
end of the norm of 4–5 percent of GDP over the medium-term, assuming that the terms of
trade remains well above the average of the past 10 years (Table 3).
46.
Australia’s sizable short-term external debt is a key macro-financial risk in the
current global environment. Short-term debt (on a residual maturity basis) comprises
almost half of external debt and is relatively high by advanced country standards (Figure 12).
Most of the short-term debt matures in 90 days or less, and almost 70 percent of total external
debt is held by financial institutions. The proposed liquidity guidelines for banks should
encourage less reliance on short-term wholesale funding. Moreover, if banks face problems
rolling over external debt, they have access to the RBA’s new liquidity facilities, including
discounting mortgages. In such circumstances, the resultant increase in Australian dollar
liquidity would lead to a depreciation of the exchange rate.
47.
The authorities noted that recent experience suggests limited problems with

Box 3. Australia: Equilibrium Real Effective Exchange Rate
Staff estimates suggest that the Australian dollar is broadly in line with fundamentals. These estimates are

(MB) approach, the equilibrium real
exchange rate (ERER) approach, and the

external sustainability (ES) approach.
The MB estimates suggest that the
equilibrium current account deficit is
about 4½ percent of GDP, reflecting
relatively high population growth.
Staff’s projected current account deficit is
broadly in line with the norm. This
implies a small undervaluation of about
4 percent.
The ERER estimates suggest a small
overvaluation. The model attempts to
explain the Real Effective Exchange Rate
(REER) on the basis of the terms of trade,
relative productivity, and relative
government consumption. Using an
estimate of the June 2009 level for the
REER as the base, the equation suggests
an overvaluation of about 5 percent in
2014, assuming a weakening of the terms
of trade in 2009.
The ES approach implies an
overvaluation of less than 10 percent,
assuming that net foreign liabilities (NFL)
stabilize at the norm estimated by the
model of about 46 percent of GDP over
the medium-term. However, the predicted
NFL is mainly explained by the fixed
effect, which casts doubt on the model. A
smaller overvaluation of less than
5 percent would result if we assume NFL
stabilizes at the end-2008 level of
60 percent of GDP.

Staff projects an increase in net foreign liabilities to 70 percent of GDP by 2014,
assuming current account deficits of about 4 percent of GDP are sustainable. With
relatively attractive returns to investment in Australia, owing to high commodity prices and
expected strong demand from China and other Asian economies, financing the deficits
should be feasible. Moreover, Australia’s current account deficits largely reflect high
investment rather than low saving, and should be sustainable as long as investment leads to
growth in export capacity, especially in the resource sector. 10 More limited access to foreign
capital markets than assumed by staff would lower investment, with negative implications for
potential growth.

The staff and authorities agreed that there are a number of factors mitigating
the vulnerability stemming from external debt. These include the limited currency risk
associated with the foreign debt, the sound banking system, and the robust macroeconomic
policy framework. Moreover, while Australia’s net foreign liabilities are sizable, gross
external debt relative to GDP is lower than in many advanced countries. Almost 40 percent
of gross foreign debt is in Australian dollars, with half of the remainder in U.S. dollars
(Tables 4, 5, and 6). Survey data suggests the bulk of the foreign-currency-denominated debt
is hedged against currency risk.

30
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
50.
The authorities’ timely and significant macro policy response cushioned the
domestic impact of the global financial crisis. However, growth has fallen well below
trend and the near-term outlook remains weak and highly uncertain. Growth is projected to
pick up in 2010, led by government infrastructure spending. Should the global turmoil
intensify, Australia is in a strong position to react by delivering further macroeconomic
policy stimulus.
51.
The RBA’s earlier reductions in the policy rate were appropriate, as is the
current stance of monetary policy. The substantial fiscal and monetary stimulus in train,
and signs of recovery in consumer and business confidence, should help support domestic
demand. However, if the outlook for growth and inflation weakens, the RBA has scope for
further cuts in the policy rate. Unconventional monetary policy easing measures are unlikely
to be needed, but the authorities should consider how such measures could be implemented if
required. The RBA should exercise more caution than normal in tightening, given the fragile
state of the global economy. The inflation targeting framework is relatively flexible and has
been successful in anchoring medium-term inflation expectations.
52.
The flexible exchange rate has been a helpful buffer. The depreciation of the
currency sustained exporter incomes as the U.S. dollar price of commodity exports fell
sharply in late 2008. A range of indicators suggest that the currency is now broadly in line
with fundamentals.

Quick implementation of targeted and temporary fiscal stimulus is providing a
53.
sizable boost to domestic demand in 2009 and 2010. Moreover, the shift of the budget into
deficit is appropriate in current circumstances, given low public debt by advanced country
standards. There is scope for further fiscal stimulus if the outlook for growth weakens,
although monetary policy should be the first line of defense, given that it remains effective.
The government’s commitment to return to surpluses and achieve a positive budget balance,
on average, over the medium term is commendable. However, further fiscal adjustment may
be needed to achieve this objective if trend growth and the terms of trade are lower than
assumed.
54.
Banks’ healthy starting position and the prompt policy response to the global
crisis helped preserve financial stability, but some vulnerabilities remain. On the
liabilities side, despite relatively good regulation and supervision, banks were exposed to
significant risks from short-term wholesale funding. The introduction of the wholesale
funding and retail deposit guarantees and RBA actions to provide sufficient liquidity helped
maintain financial sector stability. But banks must continue to manage carefully their shortterm offshore debt and the planned introduction of new liquidity guidelines should encourage
less reliance on short-term wholesale funding. On the asset side, non-performing loans could
rise further (albeit from a low base) as unemployment increases and growth remains weak.

31
Banks have increased provisioning against such losses and raised equity from private capital
markets in early 2009.
55.
APRA regularly undertakes stress tests and in the future these tests should be
based on more extreme scenarios than used in the past. Prudential judgment should be
used to assess the adequacy of the banks’ capital buffers, and capital requirements raised if
necessary. The ongoing work on crisis preparedness will be important to prepare for the
unlikely event of liquidity or solvency problems in major banks in Australia and New
Zealand.
56.
Australia’s current account deficit and sizable short-term debt are
vulnerabilities in the current global environment. In the past, Australia has readily
financed its current account deficit, but global capital markets and the availability of capital
have become more challenging. A further tightening of credit conditions would likely result
in a fall in investment, with negative implications for potential growth. Nonetheless,
Australia remains a relatively attractive destination for investment, especially in the resource
sector. The currency risk associated with the external debt is mitigated by widespread foreign
exchange hedging.
57.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation cycle with Australia take place on
the standard 12-month cycle.

APPENDIX I. AUSTRALIA: POLICY RESPONSES TO THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS
Monetary Policy

Cash rate target cut by cumulative 425 basis points to 3 percent since
September 2008.

Liquidity Support The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) extended the list of securities
used as collateral in repo operations to include residential mortgagebacked securities, commercial paper, and asset-backed commercial
paper. Furthermore, the RBA extended the maturity of repos to one
year.
The RBA established a US$30 billion swap line with the US Federal
Reserve Bank in September 2008, initially through January 2009 and
later extended to October 2009.
The government announced that it would purchase up to $A 8 billion of
residential mortgage-backed securities.
Funding
Guarantees

Under the Financial Claims Scheme, total deposit balances up to and
including $A 1 million per customer held in eligible authorized deposit
taking institution (Australian-owned and subsidiaries of foreign-owned
banks, but not branches) are guaranteed. Deposits over $A 1 million
can also be guaranteed for the same fees as applied for wholesale
funding. The scheme became effective in October 2008 and will remain
in place until October 2011.
Eligible authorized deposit taking institutions can secure guarantees for
their existing or new wholesale funding for a fee ranging from 70 to
150 basis points depending on the credit rating of the institution.

Financial
Regulation/
Supervision

The authorities enhanced supervision of credit rating agencies and
research houses.
In September 2008, the Australian Securities and Investments
Commission (ASIC) banned covered short selling of financial and
nonfinancial stock. In December 2008, the government passed
legislation to ban all naked short selling in Australia (subject to any
exemption put in place by ASIC). The ban on covered short selling of
nonfinancial stocks was lifted in November 2008. The ban on covered
short selling of financial stocks was lifted in May 2009.
The RBA is working with industry representatives to improve
disclosure of securities lending activity.

39
APPENDIX II. AUSTRALIA: FINANCIAL SECTOR ASSESSMENT PROGRAM (FSAP):
KEY RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE 2006 FSAP AND UPDATE ON THE PROGRESS OF IMPLEMENTATION1
Issue

Key Recommendations

Progress of Implementation

Banking

Continue to ensure strong
risk management
practices, including
through regular stress
testing.

The Basel II framework came into effect in January 2008, with regular
stress testing forming an important element of the framework. Five banks
were approved to adopt the internal ratings based approach with respect to
credit risk, and advanced measurement approach (AMA) for operational
risk.

Failure
Resolution
and Crisis
Management

Continue to develop a
formal process to manage
the failure of individual
institutions and more
widespread crises.

The government introduced in October a Financial Claims Scheme (FCS)
intended to provide depositors in a failed ADI with timely access to the
first $A 1 million of their funds, and policyholders of a failed general
insurer with a right to have claims met. The legislation also included
broader crisis management arrangements, enhancing regulators’ ability to
deal with a distressed ADI or general insurer.

Supervisory
Capacity

Ensure that the
supervisory agencies have
adequate resources and
flexibility.

In the 2007/08 Budget, APRA received additional funding over a four-year
period to improve its staff capabilities. In October 2008, to manage issues
associated with the global financial crisis, the Government provided
additional funding to APRA of $A 45.5 million over four years. The
government has also enhanced APRA’s flexibility by removing the
requirement to obtain ministerial consent before taking administrative
actions. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC)
also received substantial funding increases over recent years.

Cooperation
with New
Zealand
Regulators

Build on the progress
made within the TransTasman Council on
Banking Supervision to
improve coordination in
crisis management.

Legislative changes formalizing a requirement on regulators in the two
countries to be alert to each other’s interests in times of stress came into
force in both countries in December 2006.

Insurance

Push ahead with Stage II
reforms (e.g., capital
management, reinsurance
documentation, corporate
government standards,
disclosure requirements).

APRA is harmonizing prudential requirements, including capital adequacy,
between life insurance, general insurance, and banking sectors. From
July 1, 2008, all Direct Offshore Foreign Insurers operating in Australia
must be authorized by APRA and subject to Australia’s prudential regime.
Discretionary Mutual Funds are now subject to rigorous and compulsory
information collection.

AML/CFT

Give high priority to
make the appropriate
legislative and
operational arrangements
in the AML/CFT area.

The AML/CFT Act was adopted in December 2006. The first tranche of
reforms covered the activities of financial service providers, gambling
services and bullion dealers. Implementation is now complete. The second
tranche of legislative and regulatory reforms, intended to capture
designated non-financial businesses and professionals is planned is under
consideration by the Government. Legislation has been implemented
facilitating information exchange between the Australian Transaction
Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) and APRA.

The work of the Trans-Tasman Council now focuses more on the practical
aspects of coordination in crisis management.

1/ Shaded areas represent actual data. Individual shocks are permanent one-half standard deviation shocks. Figures
in the boxes represent average projections for the respective variables in the baseline and scenario being presented.
Ten-year historical average for the variable is also shown.
2/ Permanent 1/4 standard deviation shocks applied to real interest rate, growth rate, and current account balance.
3/ One-time real depreciation of 30 percent occurs in 2009. This scenario assumes foreign exchange hedging covers
79 percent of foreign currency debt, consistent with the findings of a survey by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, as
reported in "Australia's Foreign Currency Exposure and Hedging Practices," RBA Bulletin, December 2005.

When a member has overdue financial obligations outstanding for more than three
months, the amount of such arrears will be shown in this section.
VII. Exchange Rate Arrangement. Australia has accepted the obligations of Article VIII,
Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Articles of Agreement, and maintains an exchange system that is
free from restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international
transactions, except for exchange restrictions that are maintained solely for the preservation
of national or international security and which have been notified to the Fund pursuant to
Executive Board Decision No. 144-(52/51). The exchange rate is independently floating, but
the Reserve Bank of Australia retains discretionary power to intervene. There are no taxes or
subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange.
VIII. Restrictions on Capital Transactions. Australia maintains a capital transactions
regime that is virtually free of restrictions. Two main restrictions on foreigners require:
authorization for significant ownership of Australian corporations; and approval for
acquisition of real estate.
IX.
Article IV Consultation. Australia is on the 12-month consultation cycle. The 2008
Article IV consultation discussions were held during June 23–July 1, 2008, the Executive
Board discussed the staff report (IMF Country Report No. 08/312) and concluded the

3
consultation on September 10, 2008.
X.
FSAP Participation. The FSAP missions took place during November 30–
December 14, 2005, and March 26–April 12, 2006. The FSSA (including financial sector
ROSCs), the Detailed Assessment of Observance of Standards and Codes, and the Technical
Note on Investor Protection, Disclosure, and Financial Literacy, were published as Country
Reports No. 06/372, No. 06/415, and No. 06/437, respectively.
XI.
Fourth Amendment. Australia has accepted the Fourth Amendment to the Articles
of Agreement.

Annex II. Australia: Statistical Issues
Data provision is adequate for surveillance. Australia subscribed to the Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS) and its metadata are posted on the Fund’s Dissemination
Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB). In recent years, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)
has taken several initiatives to further improve the quality of the data, such as including the
prices of financial services in the CPI and developing new measures of labor
underutilization.
In September 2006, STA met with officials from the ABS, the Australian Prudential
Regulation Authority, and the Reserve Bank of Australia to encourage the reporting of
monetary data using the standardized report forms (SRFs) introduced in October 2004. The
SRFs provide for accounting data to be broken down by instrument, sector, and currency.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2009 Article IV Consultation with
Australia
On August 5, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Australia. 1
Background
Australia was in a strong economic position at the onset of the global recession. Sound
macroeconomic policies and structural reforms, together with a stable external environment,
delivered 17 years of continuous economic growth. National income was boosted in recent
years by a commodity price boom, which pushed the terms of trade to its highest level in more
than half a century. The Commonwealth government took advantage of the favorable
environment and eliminated its net debt. Banks were also in a healthy position at the onset of
the turmoil, with returns on equity of 15–20 percent. Further, a conservative approach by
regulators and supervisors meant that banks had relatively low leverage and high capital
adequacy ratios.
The turmoil sparked by the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 had an immediate
impact on Australian markets. Key commodity prices fell sharply, domestic money markets
came under stress, offshore funding tightened, the currency depreciated, and equity prices
plunged.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
However, the crisis has not hit real activity in Australia as hard as in many other advanced
economies owing to limited higher-tech manufacturing, robust commodity exports, and an
effective policy response. The 425 basis point reduction in the Reserve Bank of Australia’s
policy interest rate since September 2008 has been largely passed through to lending rates,
while the sound banking system helped avoid a sharp contraction of credit. The flexible
exchange rate has provided a buffer for export incomes. In addition, a sizable fiscal stimulus is
being delivered, supporting domestic demand.
Nonetheless, the crisis highlighted some vulnerabilities and the near-term outlook remains
highly uncertain. Both household debt (at over 150 percent of disposable income in 2008) and
short-term external borrowing (at over 50 percent of GDP in 2008) are high by advanced
country standards. Unemployment has increased, but less so than in many other advanced
countries. Aggressive policy action is expected to limit the decline in activity to ½ percent in
2009. The recovery will likely be slow, with growth of 1½ percent projected for 2010, led by
government spending on infrastructure, as households and businesses continue to
deleverage.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for their timely policy response, which has
effectively cushioned the impact of the global financial crisis on the Australian economy. The
sizable fiscal and monetary stimulus, a flexible exchange rate, and a resilient banking sector
should underpin a sustained recovery. Australia is in a strong position to deliver further
macroeconomic policy stimulus if needed.
Directors noted that the near-term outlook for growth is weak and subject to high uncertainties
in global financial markets. Australia’s persistent current account deficit, sizable short-term
external debt, and worsening households’ balance sheets were seen as vulnerabilities. While a
number of factors are at play to mitigate these vulnerabilities, including the robust supervisory
framework and the widespread hedging against currency risk, vigilance continues to be
required.
Directors welcomed the Reserve Bank of Australia’s early reductions in the policy rate and
supported the current monetary policy stance. They saw room for further policy rate cuts, as
the first line of defense in the event that the outlook for growth and inflation weakens. Directors
noted that unconventional monetary policy easing measures, though unlikely to be needed,
should remain in the authorities’ toolkit. They agreed that the flexible inflation-targeting
framework has been successful in anchoring medium-term inflation expectations.
Directors considered that the flexible exchange rate policy provides a helpful buffer against
external shocks. The depreciation of the currency helped sustain export incomes as the U.S.
dollar price of commodity exports fell sharply in late 2008. Directors noted the staff’s
assessment that the Australian dollar in real effective terms is broadly in line with medium-term
fundamentals.

3
Directors welcomed the targeted, temporary fiscal stimulus, which is expected to support
domestic demand in 2009 and 2010. Given low public debt, they generally considered that
there remains scope for further fiscal stimulus if warranted by circumstances, while stressing
the need to exercise prudence in light of the contingent liabilities associated with exceptional
support provided to the financial sector. Directors welcomed the government’s commitment to
a deficit exit strategy, aimed at returning the budget to surpluses over the medium term. They
recognized, however, that further fiscal adjustment could be needed to achieve this objective if
trend growth and the terms of trade are lower than assumed.
Directors observed that the banking sector entered the global recession from a position of
strength, and that banks have subsequently increased provisioning against rising
nonperforming loans. Noting that banks are exposed to risks from short-term wholesale
funding, they welcomed the planned introduction of new liquidity guidelines to encourage
banks to reduce reliance on this source of funding. Directors encouraged the authorities to
remain vigilant to house price adjustments and to monitor banks’ property exposures closely.
Directors commended the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority for regularly stress
testing financial institutions. It will be prudent to conduct future stress tests based on more
extreme scenarios, and to raise capital requirements if necessary. Directors welcomed the
ongoing work on crisis preparedness in the unlikely event of liquidity or solvency problems.
