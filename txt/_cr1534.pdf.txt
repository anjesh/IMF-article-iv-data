UNION OF THE COMOROS
STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

January 13, 2015

KEY ISSUES


The Comorian economy continues to grow although at a slightly slower pace.
Economic growth in 2014 is projected at 3.3 percent, adversely affected by electricity
disruptions and slower-than-expected implementation of the public investment
program. Inflation has remained subdued. Staffs’ baseline assumption is that real GDP
growth will average around 4 percent per annum over the medium term, provided
reforms are implemented.



Implementation of the 2014 budget was challenging, particularly after mid-year.
While revenues were broadly on target, resources were inadequate to meet the higherthan-budgeted wage bill resulting from an increase in teacher salaries in March and
previously un-budgeted expenditures, including on elections. Domestically-financed
investment spending was severely constrained and temporary arrears were incurred on
salaries and external debt.



The key short-term challenge is to find a better balance between available
resources and expenditures so that arrears can be avoided. Spending plans need to
be based on realistic expectations of the resources likely to be available. The 2015
budget is premised on this principle but the scope for domestically-financed investment
is inadequate as obligatory spending on wages and salaries and debt service absorbs
most of domestic revenue.



For the medium-term the key challenges are to create fiscal space for
infrastructure investment and social spending, accelerate inclusive growth and
employment generation, and reduce poverty. The authorities need to focus their
efforts on strengthening revenue administration and public financial management to
expand fiscal space and improve transparency. Weaknesses in the business environment,
including inadequate infrastructure, especially in the energy sector, and difficulties in
contract enforcement represent important challenges.

UNION OF THE COMOROS

CONTEXT
1.
Country Context. Comoros is a small, poor, and fragile-three island state with limited natural
resources and connectivity to the rest of the world. Political instability and fractious inter-island
relations marked the country during the first decades after independence from France in the mid1970s with more than 20 coups or coup attempts taking place. Economic performance was poor
during this period with per capita GDP stagnant or declining (Text Figure 1). A semblance of political
stability and economic turnaround has been in place following the adoption of a new constitution in
2009 that sought to clarify the respective roles and responsibilities of the Union and the three
autonomous islands. However, coordination challenges between the Union government and the
islands remain, resulting in weak delivery of public services. Moreover, the private sector exhibits
limited dynamism in an unfavorable business environment. During the 2009–13 ECF arrangement,
the secular decline in per capita GDP was arrested and some progress was achieved in consolidating
macroeconomic stability and advancing structural reforms that enabled Comoros to attain the
completion point under the HIPC Initiative in December 2012.

Traction. Progress on structural reforms since the 2012 Article IV consultation has generally
been disappointing (Annex I). While the authorities’ post-HIPC reform program emphasized
advances on revenue administration (RA), public financial management (PFM), state enterprises, and
the business environment, progress across all these areas has been lacking reflecting limited
implementation capacity. With two rounds of parliamentary elections in January and February 2015
and presidential elections in late 2015 or early 2016, there is a risk that the authorities’ room for
maneuver on needed reforms could be further diminished in the immediate future.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
3.

Macroeconomic Performance in 2013 and 2014.


Real GDP Growth was an estimated 3.5 percent in 2013, the highest growth rate in almost a
decade, supported by relatively buoyant activity in the construction and services sectors.
(Figure 1 and Table 1). For 2014, economic growth is projected to slow to 3.3 percent
because of the adverse effects of slower-than-expected implementation of public
investment and frequent electricity interruptions, although performance in agriculture is
reported to have been favorable.



Twelve-month CPI inflation was 3.5 percent at end-2013 but had eased to 0.1 percent by
October 2014, reflecting subdued increases in food prices and fuel and transportation costs,
as well as, in recent months, weak demand due to delays in public sector salary payments.



Exports (mainly of cloves, vanilla, and ylang-ylang) are estimated to have grown strongly in
volume terms in 2013, albeit from a very low base, but prices were low (Table 2). With
imports growing strongly, the trade deficit widened somewhat. Remittances continued to
increase, partly offsetting the effect of the higher imports on the current account deficit,
which is estimated at 11.3 percent of GDP. For 2014, exports (other than re-exports) appear
set to decline, reflecting stock building in the context of low world market prices for the
main export crops. Imports also seem likely to decline, reflecting in part the slow
implementation of the public investment program, while remittances have continued to
increase, reaching a record level of 26.4 percent of GDP. On balance, the current account
deficit is projected to narrow to 7.4 percent of GDP.

4.

Fiscal Outturn for 2013 and 2014.


Fiscal developments in 2013 were strongly affected by the spending of significant amounts
of proceeds from the Economic Citizenship Program (ECP)1 that had accrued in government
accounts at the central bank in 2012 (Table 3).2 Despite only a modest increase in tax
revenue, of 0.3 percentage points of GDP to 12.1 percent, and a decline in non-tax revenue
of 3.2 percentage points of GDP, mainly as a result of a sharp contraction in the ECP receipts,
the government was able to raise domestically-financed capital spending to 3.4 percent of
GDP by drawing on the ECP deposits. The overall balance (cash basis, net of debt relief) went
from a surplus of 1.6 percent of GDP in 2012 to a deficit of 1.3 percent. Arrears of about

1

The ECP involves the selling of passports to foreign nationals in some Middle Eastern countries, mainly the United
Arab Emirates. Revenues from the program declined steeply in 2013 following the imposition of tighter controls in
response to earlier irregularities.

The 2013 fiscal accounts also reflect the recording of debt relief under the HIPC Initiative and the MDRI amounting
to 16.8 percent of GDP.

€225,000 were incurred on a rescheduled loan with an official bilateral creditor in late
December 2013.3


Implementation of the 2014 budget was challenging. The fiscal situation during the first
three-quarters of 2014 was tight, especially after mid-year, when resources were inadequate
to meet the higher wage bill resulting from a sizeable un-budgeted increase in teacher
salaries approved in March. Preliminary figures indicate that for the year as a whole,
revenues will be slightly higher than projected, whereas primary current spending could be
almost 20 percent higher-than-planned, almost fully matched by a corresponding shortfall in
domestically-financed capital spending. Also, public sector salaries for July were not paid
until mid-September and those for August not until late October as funds were diverted to
pay for un-budgeted election costs and expenses related to the hosting of the summit of
the Indian Ocean Islands Commission. Moreover, the government was unable to pay
announced subsidies to the electric utility, exacerbating an already difficult electricity
situation, and incurred arrears on a rescheduled commercial loan of about US$1 million.
During the first three-quarters of 2014, the execution rate for the foreign-financed public
investment program was only 67 percent, and no significant pickup was expected in the
fourth quarter.
Monetary Developments.



Net credit to the economy grew by 21 percent in 2013, reflecting the drawdown of ECP
proceeds by the government and a substantial increase in private sector credit (Table 4). The
credit expansion was largely offset by a decline in net foreign assets, mainly of the central
bank, and broad money expanded by just 2.8 percent. Mirroring, the decline in the net
foreign assets of the central bank, international reserves shrank substantially in 2013, to
5.4 months imports by year-end.



The Pattern of monetary developments during the first three-quarters of 2014 was similar
to that of 2013, with a further drawdown of government deposits. However, with the central
bank’s net foreign assets stable, reflecting the stronger balance of payments position, the
pace of broad money growth picked up somewhat.

These arrears were settled in March 2014.

6.

Social Developments.


The most recent data on poverty—from 2004—suggest that poverty is pervasive but the
paucity of data makes a comprehensive assessment of progress in poverty reduction
impossible.4 There is some evidence of improvement in social indicators (primary
education, child mortality, maternal health) in recent years (Table 5).

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
7.
Outlook for 2015. Economic growth is expected to strengthen to 3.5 percent in 2015, despite
continuing headwinds from the situation in the electricity sector and a tight fiscal situation,
supported by an acceleration in the pace of implementation of foreign-financed public investment
and lower fuel prices. The impact on the economy of lower international fuel prices is uncertain, in
part as oil imports are purchased by the state oil importing company through long-term contracts
and due to uncertainty as to the extent to which lower oil prices will be passed on to consumers. The
positive impact of lower fuel prices on the current account deficit is expected to be more than offset
by higher investment-related imports with the deficit widening to 11 percent of GDP. Inflation is
expected to be well contained, at 2 percent over the course of the year.
8.
Medium-Term Outlook. Staff’s baseline assumption is that real GDP growth will average
about 4 percent per annum over the medium term supported by the expansion of agriculture,
tourism, and fisheries as well as a large, mostly foreign-financed, public investment program (mostly
for construction).5 Inflation is projected to be contained at around 2.5 percent per year by the peg to
the euro under the monetary cooperation agreement with France. With remittances and foreignfinanced investment spending expected to remain strong, import growth is expected to exceed
export growth. The current account deficit is projected to average close to 11 percent of GDP and
be financed mainly by project grants but also by some foreign direct investment and modest
recourse to concessional borrowing. Reserves are projected to stabilize around five months of
prospective imports of goods and services.
9.
Risks. The principal channels through which the international economy affects Comoros are
remittances, international food and fuel prices, donor aid, foreign direct investment (mainly from the
Middle East), and exports (Annex II). Remittances, mainly from the diaspora in France, have remained
resilient, and even rising, in the face of the global slowdown in recent years. The impact of a drop in
remittance inflows on growth would be relatively muted by the fact that only a small share of
remittances is spent on productive activities in Comoros (see paragraph 22), however, consumption
and welfare would be adversely affected. The outlook for international food and fuel prices,
4

Surveys are being completed that should allow an assessment of the current poverty situation.

5

With an annual population growth rate of about 3 percent, the projected growth in per capita terms is modest.
Construction of roads, schools, and hospitals, mostly financed by bilateral foreign grants, account for a large part of
the investment program.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 7

UNION OF THE COMOROS

especially the latter, is generally benign. Moreover, despite the slower-than-expected rate of
implementation of the public investment program in 2014, there are no signs that donors are
pulling back from Comoros. Foreign direct investment and exports, while important drivers of
growth, are starting from a small base. On balance, it is staff’s view that a protracted period of
slower growth in advanced economies and/or continued turmoil in the Middle East would have only
a limited impact on economic growth in Comoros. Comoros is also highly vulnerable to natural
disasters, including volcanic eruptions and earthquakes, and flooding resulting from cyclones in the
southwestern Indian Ocean, a vulnerability that is expected to intensify as a result of climate change.
10.
Debt Sustainability Analysis. The revised DSA—which, unlike the previous DSA, takes
remittances fully into account—calls for an upgrading of Comoros’ risk of debt distress rating to
moderate from high (DSA Supplement). There are no breaches of debt burden and debt service
thresholds in the baseline scenario and only a moderate breach of one threshold in the standard
alternative scenario and stress tests. Customized scenarios that incorporate lower remittances or
substantially higher external borrowing than in the baseline underscore continuing debt
vulnerabilities. Moreover, Comoros has incurred some arrears on its rescheduling agreements under
the HIPC Initiative. The authorities welcomed the proposed upgrading of the risk of debt distress
classification. Staff urged the authorities to address the underlying debt management weaknesses
reflected in the incurrence of external arrears, notably by strengthening coordination between the
Debt Department and the Treasury, and to continue to limit external borrowing to loans on
concessional terms.

MACROECONOMIC POLICIES AND STRUCTURAL
REFORMS
A. Introduction
11.

8

Key Challenges. Comoros’ key challenges are:


In the short-term, to bring the fiscal situation under control in order to avoid the incurrence
of domestic and external arrears, while arresting the depletion of government deposits at
the central bank and easing the pressure on international reserves.



Over the medium-term, to address the underlying sources of fragility by creating fiscal
space, accelerating inclusive growth, employment generation, and poverty reduction while
simultaneously strengthening resilience against external shocks, including natural disasters.

B. Short-Term Fiscal Policy
12.
The Budget for 2015.6 In discussing the fiscal outlook for the remainder of 2014, the
authorities and staff agreed that the most urgent task was to prioritize spending so that arrears on
public sector wages and salaries and external loan payments could be eliminated by year-end, while
maintaining a modest deposit buffer at the central bank. For 2015, staff argued that bringing
spending into line with available resources was key to gaining control of the fiscal situation. In this
connection, staff indicated that the authorities’ initial budget proposal for 2015 was based on
excessively optimistic projections of tax revenue (an increase of about 30 percent in nominal terms)
without any clearly identified measures. As a result, the proposed spending plans needed to be
scaled back. To align revenue and spending, staff recommended that the authorities take immediate
steps to strengthen revenue mobilization by (i) freezing/rationalizing exemptions, and enforcing
compliance, particularly for excise taxes and custom duties, (ii) maintaining the wage bill constant
relative to GDP despite significant pressures for higher wages and hiring, (iii) scaling back spending
on goods and services, and (iv) delaying domestically-financed capital spending. The authorities
acknowledged the need for the 2015 budget to be based on realistic revenue projections and for
spending plans to be aligned to those projections as recourse to domestic financing would be
limited to a small amount of statutory advances from the central bank.7 The revised 2015 budget
proposal, presented in the wake of the mission, fully reflects these understandings (Text Table 1).
The authorities noted that they are working with the island administrations to ensure greater control
over the wage bill. Tax revenue is projected to increase to 12.6 percent of GDP, reflecting more
limited use of tax exemptions and continued efforts to improve revenue administration. Primary
current spending is projected to decline by 0.6 percentage points of GDP, to 13.8 percent, primarily
by restraining spending on goods and services. The scope for domestically-financed capital
spending is severely circumscribed at only 1.3 percent of GDP.

6

Fiscal policy is premised on a consolidated budget for the Union and the three islands, based on constitutionally
mandated rules for revenue allocation. There are, however, clear difficulties in revenue collection and sharing, with
the islands reluctant to hand over locally-collected revenue to the Union. Moreover, the Union faces difficulties in
controlling spending, particularly on wages and salaries, as the island governments are in charge of hiring decisions.
7

The monetary cooperation agreement with France limits central bank financing of government operations by
placing a ceiling of statutory advances to no more than 20 percent of the average of tax revenues for the previous
three years.

13.
New ECP. The authorities indicated that they were optimistic that a new ECP program with
Kuwait would be agreed. Staff argued that any such highly volatile revenues should be budgeted
prudently and ring-fenced to create a buffer for external shocks and for priority investment projects.
Such resources could also possibly be used to fund the essential costs of one-off
restructuring/recapitalization of public enterprises. Staff urged the introduction of strong safeguards
to prevent the misuse of the program for illegitimate purposes and to ensure its sustainability. The
authorities generally concurred with these principles.

C. Medium-Term Fiscal Reforms
14.
Medium-Term Fiscal Stance. Public service delivery and public investment in Comoros are
severely hampered by a lack of resources and inappropriate spending prioritization: (i) the tax
revenue-to-GDP ratio (about 12 percent) is low by any standard (Figure 2); (ii) donors (World Bank,
AfDB, France, EU, some Gulf countries) provide substantial project financing but negligible budget
support; and (iii) primary current spending exceeds all tax revenue, leaving little space for
domestically-financed capital spending. Staff noted that, as for the 2015 budget, with limited
recourse possible to domestic financing,8 fiscal policy should aim for a budget stance that reflected
8

In addition to the constraint on statutory advances, a recent MCM TA mission found that it would likely take several
years before a Treasury-bill market could be developed.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNION OF THE COMOROS

identified resources, including concessional external financing. This implies a modest overall deficit
throughout the medium-term, consistent with debt sustainability. In this context staff underscored
the imperative of mobilizing additional domestic revenue to increase fiscal space in support of
development. Moreover, staff emphasized the need to enhance transparency and accountability in
the recording of government revenue and expenditure by bringing all government transactions on
budget. This could serve to lessen distrust between the Union and island governments.
15.
Revenue Administration. Staff noted that gaps in revenue administration, together with a
myriad of statutory and ad hoc exemptions created significant revenue leakage. While progress has
been made in a number of areas, including in designing an integrated tax directorate and
modernizing the customs code, the agenda of unfinished business is daunting. Cognizant of
capacity limitations in this area, staff urged the authorities to quickly implement the quick-win
revenue administration measures listed in Text Table 2 that have been identified by FAD TA as
critical first steps. The authorities welcomed the focused list of revenue administration measures and
committed to implementing them as soon as possible, taking a number of steps in this direction
following the mission. While an analytical study undertaken by staff as part of the Article IV
consultation pointed to significant potential for mobilizing additional domestic revenue (Annex III),
staff cautioned that it will take time to realize this potential and that the medium-term tax revenue
target should, therefore, be realistic.
Text Table 2. Quick-Win Revenue Administration Reforms
1. Strengthen the monitoring of the tax returns, including of public enterprises, and expand the
list of large taxpayers;
2. Project and monitor revenue (customs and tax administration) on a monthly basis;
3. Reactivate the mixed brigade of customs and tax administration officials with the aim of
improving tax compliance, through cross checks of import and turnover data;
4. Strengthen control and monitoring of temporary deferrals of payments of customs duties;
and
5. Freeze the granting of any new customs and tax exemptions and strengthen the monitoring
of exemptions already in place.

16.
Public Financial Management. As with revenue administration, staff observed that
Comorian public financial management systems were beset by weaknesses, including in regard to
budgeting, budget execution, and cash management. Staff urged the authorities to accelerate the
implementation of the reform program developed with technical assistance from FAD and AFRITAC
South. With capacity limitations in mind, staff indicated that the measures listed in Text Table 3 were
critical and that they should be implemented quickly. Staff also noted that, in view of the high wage
bill, civil service reform also needed to be high on the agenda (with input from the World Bank).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 11

UNION OF THE COMOROS

Text Table 3. Quick-Win Public Financial Management Reforms
1.Ensure that all revenue and expenditure transactions on behalf of the government are captured in
the budget and treasury accounts.;
2. Gradually restore normal financial flows (payments for goods and services and of taxes and
subsidies) between government and public enterprises and eliminate the use of offsets;
3. Project and monitor budget execution on a quarterly basis through detailed revenue and
expenditure reports;
4. Assign a treasury committee to project and monitor a treasury cash flow plan on a weekly basis;
5. Enforce a ceiling of five percent for the expenditures executed under the exceptional treasury
budgetary procedure;
6. Control the government wage bill, enforcing a ceiling for each of the Union and the three islands;
and
7. Put into place a single treasury account for the Union and the autonomous islands.

D. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
17.
Exchange Rate Peg. The authorities place great stock in Comoros’ monetary cooperation
agreement with France, which parallels the agreements underpinning the CFA zones in West Africa.
The monetary cooperation agreement provides an anchor for the monetary policy of the central
bank (Banque centrale des Comores) through a peg of the Comorian Franc to the euro (at
KMF 490 per Euro). The agreement requires the central bank to maintain international reserves equal
to at least 20 percent of base money, although for Comoros this level has typically been close to or
in excess of 100 percent. Reserve requirements are the central bank’s main instrument but have
been non-binding for an extended period as the commercial banks have maintained excess reserves.
Staff concurred that the monetary cooperation agreement has served Comoros well and should
continue to do so going forward.

E. Policies for Growth
18.
Structural Obstacles to Growth. Like many other small island states, Comoros faces growth
challenges associated with its small size and geographic isolation (Text Table 4). The narrow
resource base and small domestic market make it difficult for Comoros to diversify its economy and
take advantage of economies of scale. With weak international connectivity and high transport fees,
the costs of imports and intermediate goods are high, hampering competitiveness. The domestic
market is further fragmented by difficult relations and limited transport and communication links
between the islands, and overall infrastructure, including in energy and telecommunications, is in
need of improvement. In the discussions, staff remained cognizant of the fragile relations among the
islands and the limited capacity for implementing comprehensive and far reaching reforms by
focusing on realistic policy measures and reforms.

New Poverty Reduction Strategy. The authorities outlined their new poverty reduction
strategy for 2015-19 (Stratégie de Croissance Accélérée et de Développement Durable, SCA2D)9
that is in the final stages of preparation. As with its predecessor, the main themes of the new
strategy are to (i) achieve economic stability and inclusive growth; (ii) promote sectors with high
growth potential (tourism, fisheries, agriculture); (iii) strengthen governance and social cohesion;
and; (iv) enhance human development. Staff concurred that these themes remained appropriate but
noted that it was critical for the new strategy to be based on realistic macroeconomic assumptions
that reflected the severity of the challenges ahead, including in mobilizing adequate domestic and
external financing in support of public and private investment. Staff also expressed disappointment
that the strategy did not contain a robust discussion of private sector development that addressed
the identified drawbacks and obstacles in the Comorian business environment. The authorities
acknowledged this shortcoming but responded that the SCA2D would be a living document that
would be updated as circumstances warranted, with a chapter on private sector development to be
added in 2015. They also indicated that they planned to organize a donor conference in 2015 to
seek additional funding.
20.
External Stability and Competitiveness Assessment. Standard models suggest that at
end-2013 the real effective exchange rate was moderately overvalued but, given the large real
depreciation of the Comorian Franc during 2014 as the US dollar strengthened against the euro, this
has been corrected and the Comorian Franc is now broadly in line with fundamentals (Annex IV). The
authorities noted this assessment and stressed their commitment to the existing exchange rate peg
against the euro, a view staff supported. Staff pointed out that survey-based indicators point to
competitiveness issues related to poor infrastructure and institutional and governance deficiencies
that affect the quality of the business environment. Thus, Comoros ranks low on the list of the World
Bank’s Doing Business Indicators (159th of 189 countries). Comoros ranks particularly poorly in the

areas of starting a business, enforcing contracts, and government effectiveness. Comoros performs
similarly poorly on comparative governance and corruption indicators. The authorities felt that
progress in these areas had been made, especially by putting in place updated legislation, but they
acknowledged that this had not yet resulted in improvements in the rankings and that it is
important to ensure the consistent application of the new laws.
21.
Growth-Enhancing Structural Reforms. Staff argued that Comoros needed to be especially
ambitious in pursuing growth-enhancing structural reforms. In particular, staff encouraged the
authorities to take advantage of assistance provided by the IFC to strengthen the business
environment, not least in regard to the ease of establishing a business and the enforcement of
contracts. Staff also maintained that, while a lack of resources constrains investment, progress could
be made by prioritizing the highest return infrastructure investments and restructuring public
utilities to ensure they are able to provide their services reliably and cost effectively. Action was
particularly urgent in the field of energy where both the main electrical utility (MAMWE) and the
fuel importing company (SCH) face severe difficulties.10 Staff pointed out that the electricity
shortages and recurrent blackouts represented significant obstacles to growth. The authorities
acknowledged the acute problems in the electricity and fuel sectors. They indicated that they were
committed to working closely with the World Bank and African Development Bank, both of which
already have approved projects to help restructure and strengthen the electricity sector. They also
confirmed that the Ministry of Finance had opened a revolving line of credit of $20 million with the
Islamic Development Bank to ensure the availability of the financing for fuel imports.11 Staff
cautioned that this credit line needed to be carefully handled. Staff also argued that the introduction
of competition in the telecommunications sector through the privatization of the state-owned
telecommunications company and/or the issuance of an additional license to bring down costs and
improve service was long overdue. The authorities acknowledged that there had been unfortunate
delays in the process but indicated that preparations for launching a bidding process for a second
telecommunications license were well under way.
22.
Remittances and Growth. Staff pointed out that few, if any, countries enjoy as large,
remittance inflows in relative terms as Comoros. Yet, only a small share of these inflows is directed
toward productive activity. Staff noted that, as shown in recent surveys of the diaspora, a more
attractive business environment could help channel a greater share of remittances into productive
activities, thereby enhancing their contribution to growth (Box 1). The authorities expressed
confidence that remittances would remain high and agreed that it would be desirable that a larger
share flow into productive investments rather than be spent on consumption and imports.

10

Over the summer and into the fall, the capital Moroni faced recurrent blackouts because of either equipment
breakdowns or fuel shortages caused by the inability of SCH to finance fuel imports. Other parts of Grand Comore
and the other islands have been in the dark for extended periods.

Box 1 Remittances and Growth Nexus1
Remittances flows in Comoros have increased sharply in recent years. Remittances accounted for
about 26 percent of GDP in 2012 and 2013, making Comoros among the top 20 among sub-Saharan
countries and small islands (Figure 1). Remittance receipts significantly exceed receipts from the export of
goods and services (15 percent of GDP)(Figure 2). Their resilience to the recent global downturn and their
persistence has made them potentially a source of private investment funding for Comoros in a context of
limited domestic resources and volatile external financing.
Remittances mainly flow through informal channels. The funds transferred are often collected through
a migrant savings association. Most expatriate Comorians reside in France, mainly in Marseille and Paris,
but also in Mayotte. Most of the funds come from people in low-skill jobs and French social security, which
partly explains the resilience of the transfers.
Despite their relative high level, remittances have failed to translate into productive investment and
growth (Figure 3). Contrary to some high remittances-receiving countries (e.g., Moldova, Tajikistan)
where remittances have substantially contributed to boosting productive capacities and reducing
unemployment, remittances in Comoros mostly finance imports.2 A disproportionately high share of these
flows is used to finance consumption—70 percent to 90 percent—as part of “grands marriages”, crowding
out savings to finance productive investment.3 However, remittances most likely help in improving the
recipients’ standard of living and their resilience to shocks by sustaining their consumption levels and
providing them with a greater access to medications.
This inability of remittances to translate into growth and employment-creating activities mainly
reflects a poor business environment and market failures. Inadequate infrastructure in key sectors—
electricity, water and roads—along with marked weaknesses of the legal system undermine the overall
quality of the business environment in Comoros. In addition to these distortions, financial sector
intermediation is shallow and non-competitive. In this context transfer services are costly compared to
peers, impeding migrants to transfer significant amounts needed to undertake costly investments.
The authorities have sought to identify and resolve the bottlenecks of growth-creating remittances.
In June 2013, a diaspora conference, co-chaired by the World Bank, was organized by the authorities in
France in a bid to identify and lift the constraints impeding migrants from engaging in productive
activities. The diaspora identifies the quality of the business environment particularly the reliability of the
judiciary system and the high costs of transfers as the biggest obstacles to investment in Comoros.
Initiatives in strengthening the legal system, improving competition in the banking system and access to
investment opportunities need to be taken swiftly. The recent Hamboda real estate project is a good start
but needs to be carried out effectively to provide strong and consistently good signals towards this
objective. The French Cooperation Agency has also provided advice to the authorities in order to establish
appropriate conditions for the diaspora to create income generating activities.

F. Financial Sector Stability Assessment
23.
Financial System. The Comorian financial system is underdeveloped and shallow. Total
assets of the financial system were only 54 percent of GDP in 2013. The system is dominated by
bank and micro-finance deposit taking institutions while other aspects of the financial sector—
insurance, pensions, and capital markets—are almost non-existent. Four foreign-owned banks and
the state-owned postal bank (SNPSF) account for about two-thirds of total financial system assets
and three micro-finance institutions for the remaining third. Private sector credit growth has been
brisk, but from a low base and credit has been extended mostly for consumption rather than
investment. While the banking system held considerable excess reserves at end-2013, these had
declined by end-June 2014. Access to banking services is low, with 22 percent of adults with an
account at a formal institution in 2011 compared to 40 percent in Mozambique and 80 percent in
Mauritius. Although the coverage of the banking services has expanded in recent years, it remains
narrow with the number of commercial banks branches per 100,000 adults at 1.9 and the number of
bank accounts per 1,000 adults at 92 in 2013.
24.
Financial Sector Soundness. The financial system is fragile. While available indicators
suggest that the financial system is generally sound (Table 6), albeit with one large public institution
facing difficulties, these indicators need to be interpreted with caution. Reported non-performing
loans (NPLs) stood at 18 percent of total loans at end-June 2014, unchanged from end-2013 but up
from 17 percent at end-2012.12 Provisioning for non-performing loans was high, at close to 70
percent. However, different accounting standards across financial institutions and difficulties in
assessing the credit risk of borrowers due to the lack of reliable financial statements make it difficult
to firmly assess the financial soundness of the sector. Moreover, the central bank hasn’t conducted
any on-site examinations during 2013‒14 due to limited resources and the rudimentary nature of
the off-site monitoring framework. Staff encouraged the central bank to continue to strengthen
banking supervision, including risk-based supervision, in line with MCM advice, and welcomed
recent steps by the central bank to clean up a number of old non-performing loans related to
problems in the vanilla sector dating back to the early 2000s.
25.
SNPSF. Staff expressed concern about the postal SNPSF, the largest deposit-taker in the
country,13 which was beset by management problems and in need of re-capitalization and
restructuring. Some temporary measures aimed at greater control by the central bank of the
SNPSF’s lending operations continue to be applied. Staff urged the Ministry of Finance and the
central bank to closely monitor developments in the postal bank and to come up with a viable plan,
with technical assistance from MCM, for resolving the problems of the SNPSF.

12

The stock of non-performing loans includes old discount loans of KMF 1.3 billion to the vanilla sector that have
non-performing since the early 2000s. The central bank is coordinating efforts to have these loans written off.

13

All public sector salaries require deposit in the SNPSF.

OTHER ISSUES
26.
Data Adequacy. Economic data in Comoros have serious shortcomings and deficiencies in
all sectors that hamper surveillance and policy design. The authorities indicated that progress was
being made in strengthening data collection, particularly concerning the rebasing of the national
accounts and the CPI and the production of balance of payments data but that it was held back by
capacity and resource limitations. Staff noted, however, that fiscal data was only available with a
delay and lacked comprehensiveness. Moreover, balance of payments data were incomplete and of
poor quality, while capacity constraints have prevented the compilation of international investment
position data. Staff urged the authorities to continue to work with international organizations,
including the IMF, to improve statistics and to make adequate allocations to the new statistical
agency despite the tight fiscal situation. The authorities agreed with the need to adequately fund
statistical agencies and indicated that surveys that would allow the compilation of new household
income, consumption, employment, and poverty data were nearing completion.

STAFF APRRAISAL
27.
Macroeconomic policy implementation and economic performance have improved
since the adoption of the new constitution in 2009. However, much remains to be done to
accelerate inclusive growth through continued focus on policies that emphasize macroeconomic
stability and enhance the competitiveness of the economy, including through improvements in
infrastructure, and structural reforms to improve the business environment.
28.
The key near term challenge is to maintain fiscal stability. In 2014, government revenue
has been inadequate to meet the higher wage bill resulting from the increase in teacher salaries in
March and other previously unbudgeted expenditures, including on the administration of elections.
The government must strive to find a better balance between available resources and expenditures
so that it can avoid the incurrence of arrears.
29.
For the medium term, the key task is to strengthen domestic revenue mobilization to
create fiscal space to strengthen public service provision. Revenue collection is well below
potential and well below the levels of similar small island economies. In this regard, the authorities
need to focus their efforts on strengthening revenue administration through more effective
management of the large tax payer list and strengthened efforts to enforce tax compliance. More
judicious use should also be made of exemptions than has been the case.
30.
Public financial management is also in need of strengthening, particularly through the
implementation of effective cash management and greater fiscal transparency. Better cash
management should help limit the incurrence of arrears. For the sake of building trust among
stakeholders, including the autonomous island governments, it is important that all transactions on
behalf of the government, whether for revenue or spending, should be reflected in the budget.

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNION OF THE COMOROS

31.
The government’s decision to revise the draft 2015 budget to include more realistic
expectations of resource availability is a welcome step toward enhancing the credibility of the
budget as a guide to resource allocation. Efforts to strengthen revenue mobilization are bound to
take time to yield results. With the scope for financing constrained, current spending, particularly on
wages and salaries, the largest component of expenditure from domestic resources, needs to be
carefully controlled.
32.
The financial sector is fragile and problems at the postal bank remain a concern. The
authorities should continue to implement the temporary measures to keep the situation at the bank
from worsening and should work with the Fund to develop a resolution strategy.
33.
Urgent action is needed to improve energy supply reliability. Frequent blackouts and
overall shortages of electricity are a significant constraint on growth. The government should work
closely with the World Bank and the African Development Bank to fashion a long-term solution to
the energy supply problem.
34.
The new poverty reduction strategy under preparation appropriately focuses on
accelerating inclusive growth and human development. The strategy should include a strong
private sector development component aimed at improving the attractiveness of Comorian
economy as an investment and tourist destination. Following depreciation in 2014, the real effective
exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals.
35.
Lack of quality and timely economic data makes assessment of economic performance
and the formulation of economic projections and policies difficult. The authorities are urged to
make adequate allocations to the new statistical agency and continue to strive for improvements in
data quality and frequency despite the challenging budgetary environment. Rebasing the national
accounts and the CPI and improving the comprehensiveness and timeliness of fiscal and balance of
payments data are particularly urgent.
36.
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month
cycle.

Annex III. Assessing the Potential of Tax Revenues in Comoros1
This note explores the challenges facing Comoros in mobilizing sufficient tax revenue to finance its
outstanding development needs. With a tax to GDP ratio as low as 12 percent in GDP, Comoros
appears to lag well behind all comparable countries. Weak institutional capacity, excessive
exemptions, low tax compliance along with hard-to-tax sectors (agriculture and small businesses)
are at the core of this lackluster fiscal performance. However, eliminating these distortions through
implementation of revenue administration reforms (including a reduction in the use of exemptions)
has the potential to raise Comoros’ tax revenue to up 19.2 percent of GDP.

A.

Background

1.
Comoros, a Union of three semi-autonomous islands, is in a fragile state and has
been subject to a long political instability. While Comoros attained the completion point
under the HIPC Initiative in late 2012, the country has fallen short in generating sufficient
resources to finance the public investment needed to generate a sustained and inclusive growth
and curb poverty— around 44.8 percent of the population over the last two decades. 2 Real GDP
growth was poor and well below peers (Figure 1). Tax revenues performance has remained low
over the recent years amid pressing development challenges. Tax revenues, at 12 percent of GDP
in 2012, are low by any standards. Current expenditure, particularly the wage bill, absorb the bulk
of tax revenues (up to 55 percent), crowding out productive spending. In the face of such binding
development challenges, greatly strengthening revenue collection would significantly improve
fiscal space for pro-poor spending and infrastructure investment, in order to lay the foundations
for strong and inclusive growth while also strengthening resilience against external shocks.
2.
This note reviews assesses the potential level of revenues that Comoros could
mobilize given its structural characteristics -- income level, openness, economic structure,
institutions, and government policies. Using a reduced form model based on a panel of SSA
countries, the potential total revenues-to-GDP ratio for Comoros is estimated at 20.3 percent
with 19.2 percent accrued to tax revenues. This suggests that there is a potential for Comoros to
raise its tax revenue-to-GDP, on average, by some 8.7 percentage points of GDP compared to
actual average collection of 10.5 percent of GDP over 1990-2010. Moreover, the empirical results
suggest that the actual low revenue mobilization reflects both the weaknesses of the
fundamentals and distorting policies.

B.

Historical Performance

4.
Comoros registers one of the lowest fiscal performances in terms of tax revenueto-GDP ratios across all standards. Over the past two decades, the ratio of tax revenue-to-GDP
has averaged a disappointing 10.5 percent. This is 3 percentage points below the SSA average of
13.5 percent over the same period, (see Table 1). Moreover, Comoros compares unfavorably with
respect to the fragile states countries (11.4 percent) and non resource rich countries (14 percent).
A further comparison with small island countries points to the same conclusion, as Comoros had
the lowest tax to GDP ratio (see Table 2 and Figure 1) in recent years. Over recent years, higher
than average non-tax revenues, owing to large receipts from the Economic Citizenship Program
(ECP), have seemingly diluted the tax effort.3 ECP receipts accounted for more than 6 percent of
GDP in 2012, generating an overall fiscal surplus (cash basis, net of debt relief) of 1.6 percent of
GDP.
5.
Over the period under review, there have been ups and downs in revenue
performance. In the 1990s, the tax-to-GDP ratio averaged about 10.9 percent before rising to
11.7 percent during 2001–2010; and it recently increased to 11.8 percent in 2012 (see Figure 1).
The relatively poor revenue performance in the 1990s underscores the political instability in the
country, with 2 coups (1989 and 1995) and separatists’ rebellions in Anjouan and Moheli in 1997.
The 2000s display more significant swings as tax revenue-to-GDP ratio increased from
10.2 percent in 2000 to 15.7 percent in 2005, reflecting the relative political stability gained after
the adoption of a new constitution in 2001. However revenue fell by 3 percentage points in 2007
partly reflecting disruptions on Anjouan island and sanctions imposed by both the African Union
and the Union of Comoros on the island.
6.
The composition of revenues has evolved with the tax base shifting from trade
duties toward more taxes on income and profits and taxes on goods and services. While the
ratio of taxes on international trade to GDP accounted for 4/5 of total tax revenue over
1990–2000 (8.2 percent of GDP), it was only 5.3 percent over 2001–2013 (see Table 3). The
decline reflects the extent of customs exemptions but also the reduction of trade tariffs as
Comoros integrates more to the COMESA region. Over the same period, the share of domestic
taxes on goods and services has moderately increased, up from 1.4 percent in 1990s to
3.6 percent over 2001–2013. Tax from income and profits remained relatively stable but shows
some substantial increase during 2005-06. Despite extensive TA in revenue and custom
administration and public financial management progress in mobilizing more tax revenues has
been limited. Tax revenues increased by only 1.3 percentage points between 2009 and 2013, to
12.1 percent.

C.

Assessing the Potential of Tax Revenues

7.
Econometric methodology: In assessing the revenue potential for Comoros, two
complementary approaches have been used in order to relieve serious data limitations and
inconsistencies. A reduced form approach is applied, which consists of estimating an empirical
model based on panel data. Taking an SSA sample4 as the reference, the potential revenue for
Comoros is estimated as the fitted value of revenue from the reduced-form model in which
actual revenue-to-GDP is regressed on a set of country characteristics, including GDP per capita,
the composition of the economy, the degree of openness, the ratio of public debt to GDP and
other institutional factors. This approach is applied for taxes on goods and services and income
tax but also for non-tax revenues. Formally, the estimated model is given by:
Rit = αi + Xitβ + εit
The potential for international trade taxes is estimated as the actual ratio of international trade
taxes plus 30 percent of the actual collection. This ad hoc assumption is motivated by
considerable anecdotal evidence of tax leakage combined with data limitations on international
trade tax collection.5 Thus, potential tax revenues are obtained by adding up the potential for
income taxes, taxes on goods and services, and international trade taxes. Total potential
revenues are then obtained adding potential non-tax revenues to potential tax revenues. Finally,
the tax effort is derived as the ratio of actual revenues to potential revenues.
8.
Based on this approach, the empirical results point to substantial potential tax
revenues in Comoros. On average, the potential revenue that Comoros could mobilize amounts
to 20.3 percent of GDP, of which 19.2 percent accrued to tax revenue. The corresponding tax
effort index is 0.5. With the actual ratio of 10.5 percent of GDP, Comoros could raise its tax
revenue-to-GDP, on average, by about 8.7 percentage points. Looking at the different subcomponents of revenue shows that Comoros should focus on minimizing the leakages in
collecting taxes on goods and services, which account for the bulk of the identified tax gap.
9.
Broadly, Comoros’ tax effort is rather small relative to small island and SSA
countries. For the first group, the revenue effort index is 0.8 while the index is 1 for SSA
countries suggesting Comoros relative poor performance—an index of 0.6—requires sound
policy and administration reforms along with broader economic reforms intended to diversify the
economy.
4

The model is estimated over the period 1990-2010 on the following countries: Benin, Botswana, Burkina Faso,
Burundi, Cabo Verde, Central African Republic, Chad, Comoros, Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea,
Ethiopia, Gabon, The Gambia, Guinea Bissau, Guinea, Cote d’Ivoire, Kenya, Lesotho, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi,
Mali, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Sao Tome and Principe, Seychelles, Senegal,
Sierra Leone, Swaziland, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe,
5

To illustrate the point, as of June 2014, customs’ exemptions were as high as actually collected tax revenues at
around 2.03 billion KMF.

Annex IV. External Balance Assessment1
Comoros’ current account balance relative to GDP is expected to improve in 2014 mostly on
account of lower imports and larger remittance inflows. It is projected to weaken slightly over the
medium term, mainly reflecting a modest reduction in remittances relative to GDP, the import
cover of international reserves remaining broadly adequate. Standard empirical model suggest that
the real exchange rate was moderately overvalued at end-2013 but these results are subject to
considerable uncertainty related to data limitations and volatility of economic variables in a fragile
state. Moreover, the recent real depreciation of the Comorian Franc suggests that the estimates of
overvaluation may be exaggerated. Survey-based indicators underscore the need to implement
structural reforms to remove the inefficiencies and distortions that undermine the competitiveness
of the economy.

A.

Balance of Payments

1.
Comoros’ external position is vulnerable owing mainly to the country’s narrow
export base and heavy reliance on remittances to fund imports. The current account deficit is
projected at 7.4 percent of GDP in 2014, down from 11.3 percent in 2013, mostly on account of
lower imports and larger remittance inflows (Figure 1). For 2015, the current account deficit is
projected to widen again to 11 percent of GDP, despite lower oil prices, mainly on account of a
rise in investment related imports. Beyond 2015, the current account deficit is projected to
average close to 11 percent.
2.
Comoros’ real effective exchange rate depreciated by more than 10 percent from
end-2013 through October 2014, largely owing to the depreciation of the euro against
dollar. The longstanding peg of the Comorian Franc to the euro, 2 and subdued inflation, mean
that movements in the real effective exchange rate tend to be dominated by movements in the
US dollar-euro exchange rate (Figure 2)

The Comorian Franc is fixed against the Euro at a value of KMF 490 per euro under the monetary policy
agreement with France.

Reserves Adequacy3

3.
Official reserves appear to be adequate to withstand external shocks over the
medium term. Reserves reached a historical peak of KMF 72.7 billion (US$190 million) in 2012
owing to strong remittances and substantial ECP receipts. They declined to KMF 62.1 billion
(US$168 million) at the end-2013 and are projected to remain flat in 2014. Reserve coverage

remains adequate at 5 months of imports, 24 percent of GDP, and 64 percent of broad money in
2014.

C.

Price Competitiveness

4.
The Comorian Franc is estimated to be moderately overvalued using standard
analytical methods.4 While external stability assessments are particularly difficult to benchmark
for fragile countries like Comoros with severe data limitations, this conclusion is based on a
comprehensive approach using a variety of assessment methods (CGER-like): (i) the
macroeconomic balance (MB); (ii) the equilibrium real exchange rate (ERER); and (iii) the external
sustainability (ES), further complemented with the purchasing power parity (PPP) approach. The
CGER-like approaches suggest that the real effective exchange rate is moderately overvalued,
with the misalignment ranging from 5 percent to 22 percent in the short term and from 6
percent to 15 percent in the medium term, while the PPP approach signals an undervaluation of
about 10 percent in the short term and 7 percent in the medium term. Results are summarized in

5.
The macroeconomic balance approach calculates exchange rate under - or
overvaluation by measuring the adjustment needed for the real exchange rate to close the
gap between the projected medium-term CA balance at the prevailing real effective
exchange rate and a CA norm. The latter is defined as the CA that is consistent with sustainable
medium-term macroeconomic fundamentals and is estimated through a regression model
including the fiscal balance, output growth, real income, oil balance, demographics, trade
openness, relative productivity, aid and remittances. The estimated current account norm is a
deficit of 8.1 percent of GDP, while the projected medium-term current account deficit is
11.9 percent of GDP, suggesting that a depreciation of 22 percent would be required to close the

43

UNION OF THE COMOROS

gap between the underlying and the CA account norm, using an elasticity of the CA with to the
exchange rate of -0.342.
6.
The REER approach is a reduced-form regression model in which the degree
misalignment is measured by the percentage deviation of the exchange rate from its
equilibrium value. The medium-term equilibrium value of the REER is estimated in a regression
relating the REER to medium term fundamentals including the NFA position, relative productivity
differentials between tradable and non-tradable sectors, terms of trade, government
consumption but also aid and remittances for countries like Comoros. The results suggest a mild
overvaluation of about 5 percent in 2013 and 5.7 percent in 2018.
7.
The ES approach works in the same way as the MB approach. The degree of
exchange rate misalignment is measured by how much the exchange rate needs to adjust to
close the gap between the projected CA position—with no change in the exchange rate path—
and the CA norm. The later is calculated as the CA balance that stabilizes the NFA position.
Following the literature, this value is calibrated to the most recent NFA position observed of
14.8 percent of GDP in 2013 implying a CA norm (deficit) of 6.5 percent of GDP. The results
suggest that the Comorian Franc is overvalued by 14 percent.
8.
The PPP approach relies on the assumption that nominal exchange rates are related
to national price levels, and changes in the former should be in line with changes in
relative price levels. The results using this approach indicate that the Comorian Franc is slightly
undervalued, by 9.5 percent in the short term and by 7.3 percent in the medium term. However,
the deviations of the exchange rate from medium-term fundamentals are not significantly
different from zero.

D.

Structural Competitiveness

9.
Non-price and survey-based indicators underline important competiveness and
structural issues.


Comoros’ export base has deteriorated over time, with the trade deficit widening and
export shares declining relative to peers. In the medium term, exports are expected to
remain sluggish, reflecting structural inefficiencies and domestic distortions impeding
private sector development and competitiveness (See Figure 3).



The World Bank’s 2015 doing business indicators show that the overall quality of the
business environment is poor (Figure 4) and lags well behind peers (Figure 5) as Comoros
ranks 159th of 189 countries, down three places since 2014. Comoros underperforms
notably in the areas of starting a business, getting credit, enforcing contracts, paying taxes
and resolving insolvency, underscoring the need to accelerate structural reforms in these
areas.

Summary of Safeguards Assessment. The update safeguards assessment of the Banque
Centrale des Comores (BCC) in 2010 found that despite capacity constraints the central bank had
taken steps to strengthen its safeguards framework. Recommendations made to establish an
independent internal audit function and obtain assistance to adopt international standards for
financial reporting remain outstanding. The BCC has published its 2012 audited financial
statements, and staff has received the financial statements and management letter for the 2013
financial year.
Implementation of Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI): Not applicable.
Exchange Rate Arrangements: The currency of the Union of the Comoros is the Comorian
franc, which is pegged to the Euro at €1 = CF 492. The Comoros has accepted the obligations of
Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3, and 4, and maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions
on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions.
Article IV Consultation: The last Article IV consultation was concluded on December 17, 2012
(Country Report No. 13/32). Directors commended the Comorian authorities for their strong
implementation of reforms under the ECF arrangement and for reaching the completion point
under the enhanced HIPC Initiative. Welcoming the improved fiscal performance, they
encouraged the authorities to continue strengthening mobilization and to keep spending in line
with public resources mobilization capacity. They underscored the need for budget discipline and
reliance on grants and highly concessional loans, as Comoros remained at high risk of debt

RELATIONS WITH THE AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT
BANK GROUP
A. Bank Group’s Support in Comoros
The African Development Bank Group (AfDB) started its operations in Comoros in 1977 and has
since then approved seventeen (17) operations and one (2) economic and sector work (ESW).
Cumulative Bank Group commitments net of cancellation amounted to UA 78.26 million as of
November 2014. These operations targeted the public sector and were mainly financed from ADF
resources (87.6 percent). One (1) port infrastructure project was financed through the ADB
window for a net UA 9.67 million representing 12.4 percent of total net commitments. In
addition, the AfDB approved three (3) emergency operations to assist in mitigating the adverse
impact of the food crisis in 2008 (UA 1.5 million) and support victims of floods in 2009 and most
recently in 2012 (UA 1.28 million). Since 2009, in addition to the ADF, Comoros are eligible for Pillars
I and III of the Fragile States Facilities (FSF), on which they have received additional resources of
UA 21.46 million. On the Pillar I, Comoros received UA 10 million in ADF 12 and UA 10 million in
ADF 13 e), respectively addressed to support Energy Sector in the ADF 12 and Road sector in the
ADF 13. The resources on Pillar III have supported the statistical capacity building in the PRCI
(UA 595.000), the preparation of SCA2D (UA 241.000), and recently the assistance to private sector
(UA 625.000).
1.
Overall, AfDB operations in Comoros have been mainly directed toward supporting
economic-related infrastructure, support to public finances and improvement of rural livelihoods.
They have primarily concerned Energy sector (45 percent), multi-sector (21 percent), water and
sanitation (34 percent).

B. Strategic Orientation
2.
The Bank Group concretely re-engaged in Comoros in 2010 following the resolution of
the Anjouan crisis and the lifting of sanctions in February 2009 after clearance of its arrears with
the Bank. A two-year Interim Country Strategy Paper (I-CSP) 2009-2010 focusing on economic
and financial governance and water and sanitation was approved in April 2009. In December
2011, the Board of the AfDB approved a new Country Strategy Paper (CSP) for 2011–2015 based
on a single pillar focusing on the energy sector in support of economic diversification. The new
CSP draws on the Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper for 2010-2014 and spans over
two ADF cycles - ADF 12 and ADF 13. Under ADF 12, the indicative country allocation will amount
to UA 15.6 million, including UA 10 million from the Fragile States Facility (FSF). These resources
will primarily aim to finance (i) an energy sector project (UA 13.6 million) and (ii) a budget
support operation (UA 2 million) whose main objective will be to leverage the level of available
domestic resources and assist the country in reaching HIPC Completion Point by end 2012. It will
also provide Comoros with additional resources to support economic and social development
and manage transition during the post-HIPC phase. Under ADF 13, the country allocation is
amounted to UA 25 million, of which 10 from FSF. After the midterm review of the CSP, the total

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNION OF THE COMOROS

FSF resources are mobilized to finance budgetary support (UA 4 million), the Institutional
capacity building project- PRCI II (UA 5 million) and the assistance to CGP (UA 1 million).
3.
As of November 2014, the Bank’s ongoing portfolio in resources amounts to
UA 21.9415 million comprising five operations: (i) the Institutional Capacities Strengthening
Project (ICSP) whose objective is to strengthen national capacities in PFM, debt management and
macroeconomic statistics and (ii) the Drinking Water and Sanitation Project (DWSP) and (iii) the
assistance to CGP to finalize the preparation of SCA2D, , (iv)Energy Sector Support Project, and
(v) the budgetary support to Energy sector. . A Midterm review of CSP combined to Country
Portfolio Performance Review (CPPR) is approved by the Bank in November 2014.

C. Non Lending Activities
4.
Along with other developing partners, the AfDB aims to provide Comoros’s authorities
with policy advice and decision tools on key strategic directions with the objective of leveraging
and sustaining economic growth over the medium-long term. In this respect, the first phase of a
study on the sources of growth in Comoros was completed in December 2010 and provided a
series of preliminary key recommendations on ways of boosting growth and improving the
economic and business climate. A second ESW concerning Fragility study is achieved in April
2014, to support the finalization of SCA2D..

As of December 31, 2014
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance1
General: Data provision has serious shortcomings that significantly hamper surveillance. The statistical database
has deficiencies in all sectors largely due to inadequate staffing and funding, as well as lack of integration of
island-based data. Some progress was made with collecting income-distribution statistics and social welfare
indicators when the Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP) was being prepared in 2003–04. Since
then, coverage has remained limited, hampering the monitoring of progress towards the Millennium Developing
Goals (MDGs).
In January 2014 a new Statistics Act was signed by the President, providing the Directorate General of Statistics
and Planning (DGSP) a status of autonomous agency to manage an own budget. It is expected that the
administrative structure of the agency will be in place next year. From October 2014, an external consultant
assists the agency in organizational and administrative issues. In mid-2014, the statistical function were
transferred to the Institut National de la Statistique et des Etudes Economiques et Demographiques (INSEED).
The institute is under the supervision of the Ministry of Finance.
National accounts. Despite recent improvements, the national accounts compilation system remains weak and
unstable, in particular to provide regular and timely data, and thus impart a high degree of uncertainty to
economic analysis. The national accounts compilation is hampered mainly because of inadequate funding,
especially for collection of data. National accounts staff need further training.
As part of a project on Statistical Capacity Building, the African Development Bank (AfDB) assigned an
international Expert from May 2011 to January 2012, who helped DGSP to introduce new base year and
implement new compilation techniques. The new benchmark GDP for 2007 was introduced in 2012, and a follow
up mission in June 2013 assisted DGSP with the compilation of the accounts for 2008.
In the absence of regular basic source data, the GDP estimates are prepared on crude assumptions and
extrapolations, in particular as regards measurement of national account aggregates in volume terms. There is no
regular survey conducted on agriculture. The estimates are based on the results of the 2004 census in agriculture
and expert views. Little information could be retrieved on household final consumption. More data should be
available as soon as the on-going survey on employment, informal sector, and household consumption survey
(1.2.3 survey) is completed. It is expected that the GDP time series for the period 2000-2014 will be available by
June 2015 (2000 to 2006 by the end of 2014, accounts up to 2012 in March 2015).
Price Statistics. In spite of the improvements made, the accuracy and reliability of the consumer price index (CPI)
is still uncertain, mainly due to the old weighting system, based on a survey from 1999. The AfDB assigned an
international Expert from May 2011 to January 2012, who helped the NSI to design a new CPI. Baskets of
products, expenditure weights, collection locations as well as calculation techniques were revised. An IT tool was
implemented and the responsible official was trained in managing the whole compilation process.
The new CPI covers all the three islands (vs. one only for the current one); it takes into account more products
(500 vs. 128), and is based on sounder methods. The expenditure weights are not updated, still awaiting the
results of the household expenditure survey. However, the new methodology is not yet fully implemented due to
1

UNION OF THE COMOROS
lack of funding and staffing. Starting in October 2014, the statistics office will recruit consultants to help in the
analysis of the survey results and to adopt the new weighting system for CPI.
Government finance statistics. The data for the Consolidated Government Fiscal Operations table (TOFE) are
based largely on the classifications and definitions of the 1986 Government Finance Statistics Manual. The fiscal
data currently covers “government sector” defined as the government of the Union of the Comoros and the
autonomous island governments. Local governments, the central bank, and any government-owned entity with
independent legal status are excluded from the definition of government. Owing to the reporting requirements
under the Extended Credit Facility, Comoros currently does not compile fiscal statistics based on the GFSM 2001
presentation. Debt data are also not aligned with either the GFSM 2001 or the IMF’s Public Sector Debt Statistics
Guide (2011). The authorities are encouraged to adopt current international statistical standards for fiscal data
compilation and analysis.
Monetary and financial statistics. The Central Bank of Comoros (BCC) produces adequate monetary statistics
on its own accounts, for the commercial banks, the development bank, the deposits collected by the Société
nationale des postes et des services financiers (chèques postaux and saving passbooks), and for two microfinance
networks. The BCC reports monetary data in the IMF’s recommended Standardized Report Form format. The
Franc Zone arrangement has established accounting and prudential standards that prevent data disruptions. A
major shortcoming is the absence of data on the large amount of Euro cash in circulation, handicapping
surveillance. Comoros does not report Financial Soundness Indicators to the IMF’s Statistics Department.
Financial sector surveillance: Comoros does not produce Financial Soundness Indicators (FSIs) yet. An FSI
technical assistance mission is scheduled in FY 2015.
External sector statistics. The BCC compiles balance of payments statistics along the lines of the methods
recommended in IMF’s Balance of Payments Manual, 5th edition. The external sector statistics TA mission
conducted in March 2014 found that the measurement of goods is impaired by insufficient details in customs
statistics and that data collection from non financial enterprises is largely empirical. The BCC relies heavily on
estimates for key BOP components. The mission focused on steps to improve the accuracy of trade statistics for
BOP, discussed methodological issues as well as assisted the authorities to come up with a system of data
reporting to STA.
II. Data Standards and Quality
From 2013, Comoros is participating in the General Data
No data ROSC is available.
Dissemination System. In this context, the DGSP provided
information on various dimensions of the quality of its consumer
price index (CPI) and annual national accounts (ANA).
III. Reporting to STA
Comoros does not report government finance statistics to STA for publication in the International Financial
Statistics (IFS) or in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook, nor does it report balance of payments statistics
in the IFS. Among national accounts data, only GDP is reported for publication in the IFS. The BCC reports
monetary and financial statistics to the IMF using Standardized Report Forms (SRFs). The current presentation
and content of monetary statistics accords largely with the methodology in the IMF’s Monetary and Financial
Statistics Manual 2000.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION—
DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

Approved By
David Robinson (IMF) and
John Panzer (World Bank)

Prepared by the staffs of the IMF and World Bank

Based on the external LIC DSA, Comoros’ risk of debt distress is assessed as moderate rather than high,
as was the case in the previous DSA update for the sixth review under the previous ECF completed in
December 2013. The full inclusion of remittances in the analysis is the main reason for the improved
debt sustainability outlook. Public sector domestic debt and private sector external debt are minimal
in Comoros and are expected to remain so for the foreseeable future.1

Figure A2 shows the public sector debt dynamics.

UNION OF THE COMOROS

BACKGROUND
1.
Comoros reached the completion point under the HIPC Initiative in December 2012.
Following agreements with all, but one,1 bilateral creditors, Comoros received extensive irrevocable debt
relief in 2013 which resulted in a decline in nominal external debt from 40.3 percent of GDP at end-2012 to
18.5 percent at end-2013 (Text Table 1, Table A1). In 2014, France unilaterally cancelled a debt of about
$6.6 million Comoros owed to the French Post Office. All the debt and debt service indicators were brought
to well below their respective thresholds of the debt sustainability framework. Since the completion point,
Comoros has contracted only one external loan, with India of about $42 million for the construction of a
heavy-fuel electricity generation plant that is projected to be disbursed over 2015–18. Comoros has
incurred some arrears (about $1 million) on rescheduled payments under the bilateral agreements; these
are expected to be paid before end-2014.

UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS
2.
The medium-term macroeconomic framework has been updated for the 2014 Article IV
consultation and the long-term assumptions revised since the last DSA update was prepared in
December 2013.1 The long-term assumptions on growth and inflation have been retained broadly
unchanged from the previous. However, the projected current account deficits have been revised upwards
to reflect an upward revision in project grants and external financing.

1



Real GDP growth is assumed to be 3.3 percent and 3.5 percent in 2014 and 2015,
respectively, and stabilize at 4 percent per year thereafter. This represents a growth
acceleration relative to the historical record reflecting improved prospects for political
stability and governance, as well as the planned reforms in the electricity and telecom
sectors, the coming on stream of a large fishing project, and continues strong investment
financed by donors in the construction of roads, schools, and hospitals. However, with
population growth at about 3 percent per year, this growth assumption is modest in per
capita terms.



Inflation is assumed to average around 3 percent per year, anchored by Comoros’ exchange
rate peg under the monetary cooperation agreement with France.



The current account deficit is projected to average around 10.5 percent of GDP per year
over the medium term and thereafter decline gradually to 6 percent of GDP by the end of
the projection period, representing a continuation of net resource transfers to Comoros in
support of growth and development, albeit at a slowly declining rate. The drop in
international commodity prices will also help contain the imports bill. In addition to the full
inclusion of remittances, this is the most significant difference with respect to the previous
DSA which had the current account deficit narrowing more significantly over the long term.
The projected current account deficit is also larger than before because of a technical
upward revision of non-factor service imports.



Exports are assumed to grow somewhat faster than imports over the projection period but
from a very low base.



Private remittances from the diaspora in France, which have been resilient in the face of
the recession and slowdown in Europe, are projected to continue to growth in nominal
terms but decline gradually relative to GDP, from 26.4 percent in 2014 to 24 percent by 2019
and 16 percent by 2034. These remittances are assumed to continue to finance a substantial
part of imports to Comoros.

Appendix 2, Staff Report for Sixth Review under the ECF.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 3

UNION OF THE COMOROS



Gross investment in support of growth and development is assumed to stabilize at close to
24 percent of GDP. Reforms in key sectors such as energy and telecommunications are
expected to lead to higher FDI inflows during the projection period.



Public investment is projected to account for more than half of investment, initially mainly
financed by project grants. Over time, foreign borrowing (on somewhat concessional terms;
a grant element of 32 percent, corresponding to non-Paris Club bilateral terms in the LIC
DSA template) is assumed to gradually replace some of the grant financing so that by 2034
grants account for two-thirds of foreign-financed capital spending and semi-concessional
loans for one-third. This assumed pattern of external financing would seem justified in view
of the limited growth in per capita GDP that is projected over the next two decades.
Domestically-financed capital spending is projected to rise modestly over the projection
period. No domestic borrowing by the government is assumed.



The overall fiscal deficit is projected to average around 2-3 percent of GDP and be mainly
financed through external loans for investment purposes.

EXTERNAL DSA
A. Remittances Scenario
3.
Comoros qualifies for the inclusion of private remittances in the denominator of the debt
and debt service indicators for the purposes of the baseline of the DSA. For Comoros, private
remittances represent a large and reliable source of foreign exchange—currently well in excess of
25 percent of GDP—and sizable inflows are expected to continue over the medium and long term. That
said, the debt sustainability outlook is sensitive to the level of remittance flows, which more than doubled
relative to GDP between 2003 and 2013, and are potentially subject to downside risk.
4.
The inclusion of remittances in the debt sustainability analysis leads to a marked
improvement in the debt and debt service indicators relative to the previous traditional nonremittances baseline scenario. Under the remittances baseline, there are no breaches of debt or debt
service thresholds in the baseline. (Figure A1, Tables A1 and A2). Debt burdens rise gradually toward the
end of the projection period reflecting the assumption of only a modest level of external borrowing during
the projection period, based on Comoros’ continuing status as a fragile low income country. The ratio PV of
debt to exports plus remittances shows a modest breach of its threshold under the shocks to non-debt
creating inflows1 and the same indicator breaches the threshold late in the projection period in the
historical scenario. The initial improvement in the debt and debt service indicators under the historical
scenario mainly reflects the fact that the projected current account deficits in the baseline are larger than
the historical deficits over the medium term. The historical scenario is, therefore, over-financed during this
1

These non-debt creating inflows represent mainly remittances in the case of Comoros. As the remittances have
been growing rapidly over the last decade their historical standard deviation is large, which accounts for the severity
of this shock.

UNION OF THE COMOROS

period. The opposite is the case for the latter part of the projection period, when the projected current
account deficit falls below the historical average, leading to under-financing and the need for additional
borrowing.

B. Customized Scenarios—Lower Remittances and Higher Borrowing
5.
A customized scenario with lower remittances than in the baseline underscores larger debt
vulnerabilities. Rather than assuming a gradual rise in the nominal value of remittances, this scenario
assumes that levels stabilize at current nominal levels (thereby declining faster in relation to GDP than in
the baseline). The DSA is much less favorable on this basis, with a sustained breach of the PV of debt-toGDP plus remittances threshold in both the baseline and in the stress tests (Text Figure 1). Given the recent
marked changes in the level of measured remittances and corresponding uncertainties about the future
path, this alternative scenario further underpins for a “moderate” risk rating for external debt distress.

6.
The debt sustainability outlook for Comoros would also deteriorate somewhat were the
country to engage in significant external borrowing over the medium term, particularly if that
borrowing were on commercial or near-commercial terms. Additional external borrowing on
commercial terms amounting to about 5 percent of GDP per year would not on its own lead to breaches of
thresholds under the baseline but to several breaches under alternative scenarios and stress tests (Text
Figure 2). While it is unlikely that Comoros could find creditors that would be willing to extend this amount

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 5

UNION OF THE COMOROS

of credit to the country on an ongoing basis, this scenario underlines that Comoros’s scope for external
borrowing, especially on commercial terms is limited

DEBT DISTRESS CLASSIFICATION AND CONCLUSION
1.
In light of the revised DSA, it is the view of the staffs of the IMF and the World Bank that
Comoros’ risk of debt distress rating should be upgraded from high to moderate, a view that the
country authorities share. The analysis shows that, taking remittances into account, the debt and debt
service indicators remain below the applicable thresholds in the baseline, and that there are only modest
breaches under alternative scenarios and stress tests. However, customized scenarios show that debt
sustainability is sensitive to both the level of remittance flows and to external borrowing levels over the
medium-term. These findings underline the importance of fostering a climate conducive to maintaining
high levels of remittances that can be used productively, and limiting recourse to external financing,
particularly on non-concessional terms. It also highlights the importance of striving to maintain higher
growth levels compared to historical average by implementing planned structural reforms in infrastructure
and the businesses environment, the electricity and the telecom sectors in a timely fashion.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
February 9, 2015

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with the Union of
Comoros
On February 4, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the 2014 Article IV consultation1 with the Union of Comoros.
Comoros is a small, low-income and fragile-three island state with limited natural resources
and connectivity to the rest of the world. Political instability and fractious inter-island
relations marked the country during the first decades after independence from France in the
mid-1970s. Political stability and economic turnaround have been in place following the
adoption of a new constitution in 2009. Under the 2009–13 Extended Credit Facility (ECF)
arrangement the secular decline in per capita GDP slowed. Additionally, authorities made
progress in consolidating macroeconomic stability and advancing structural reforms that
enabled Comoros to complete the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative in
December 2012.
Economic growth was 3.5 percent in 2013 but is estimated to have eased to 3.3 percent in
2014, adversely affected by electricity disruptions and slower-than-expected implementation
of the public investment program. Inflation has remained subdued in the low single digits.
The current account deficit is projected to narrow to 7.4 percent of GDP in 2014 from
11.3 percent in 2013, reflecting a contraction in imports that resulted from lower imports of
investment goods and lower fuel import prices, as well as higher remittances.
Economic growth is expected to firm to 3.5 percent in 2015, despite continuing headwinds
from the electricity sector and a tight fiscal situation, supported by an acceleration in the pace
of implementation of foreign-financed public investment and lower fuel prices. For the
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2
medium term, staff’s baseline assumption is that economic growth will average around 4
percent per annum, provided that reforms are implemented.
Implementation of the 2014 budget was challenging, particularly after mid-year. While
revenues were broadly on target, resources were inadequate to meet the higher-than-budgeted
wage bill resulting from an increase in teacher salaries and previously un-budgeted
expenditures. Domestically-financed investment spending was severely constrained and
temporary arrears were incurred on salaries and external debt.
The key short-term challenge is to find a better balance between available resources and
expenditures so that arrears can be avoided. Spending plans need to be based on realistic
expectations of the resources likely to be available. The 2015 budget is premised on this
principle, but the scope for domestically-financed investment is inadequate, as obligatory
spending on wages and salaries and debt service absorb most of domestic revenue.
For the medium term, the key challenges are to create fiscal space for infrastructure
investment and social spending, accelerate inclusive growth and employment generation, and
reduce poverty. The authorities need to focus their efforts on strengthening revenue
administration and public financial management to expand fiscal space and improve
transparency. Weaknesses in the business environment, including inadequate infrastructure,
especially in the energy sector, and difficulties in contract enforcement represent important
challenges.
Based on the external low income country debt sustainability analysis, IMF and World Bank
staff have re-assessed Comoros’ risk of debt distress as moderate rather than high, which was
the case in the previous DSA update completed in December 2013. The full inclusion of
remittances in the analysis is the main reason for the improved debt sustainability outlook.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed Comoros’s improved policy implementation and economic
performance in recent years. However, Directors noted that significant challenges remain—
including high poverty, inadequate infrastructure, and vulnerabilities characteristic of small
island economies. Prudent macroeconomic policies and stepped-up reform efforts are needed
to bolster resilience, enhance competitiveness, and foster inclusive growth.

2

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views
of Executive Directors, and the summary is transmitted to the country’s authorities. An explanation o any
qualifiers used in summing up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/secmisc/qualifiers.htm.

3
Directors saw achieving fiscal stability as a key near-term objective. Regretting the
incurrence of domestic arrears in 2014, they encouraged the authorities to strike a better
balance between available resources and expenditures. In this regard, Directors welcomed the
government’s decision to base the 2015 budget on more realistic assumptions, and advised
both enhanced prioritization and restraint, including containment of the wage bill.
Directors called for efforts to strengthen revenue mobilization and public financial
management, and encouraged the authorities to implement quick-win reforms in both areas.
They noted that revenue collection trails that of peer economies, and recommended
strengthening administration through more effective management of the large tax payer list,
better enforcement of compliance, and streamlining exemptions. Strengthening public
financial management would help to limit the incurrence of arrears, enhance fiscal
transparency and credibility of the budget, and create space for infrastructure investment and
priority social spending. Directors noted the improvement in Comoros’s debt distress rating,
and encouraged the authorities to continue to rely on grants and concessional financing.
Directors cautioned against excessive reliance on the potentially volatile proceeds from a
new Economic Citizenship Program, and advised allocating these resources to investment
projects, restructuring public enterprises, and strengthening external buffers. Strong
safeguards are also needed to help prevent misuse of the program.
Directors stressed the need to develop the financial sector, and strengthen the central bank’s
regulatory and supervisory oversight, including through risk-based supervision. They called
for the development, with Fund technical assistance, of a resolution strategy to accelerate the
recapitalization and restructuring of the Postal Bank.
Directors encouraged the authorities to expedite the pace of structural reforms in order to
boost external competitiveness and growth prospects. Efforts are needed to strengthen the
business climate through the removal of key supply-side constraints in the electricity,
telecommunications, and financial sectors. Directors welcomed the progress in preparing a
new Poverty Reduction Strategy, while calling for a strong private sector development
component aimed at improving the attractiveness of the Comorian economy.
Directors encouraged the authorities to improve data quality and timeliness by prioritizing
allocations to the new statistical agency and working with technical assistance providers.
Directors agreed that assistance from development partners is critical, given Comoros’s
limited capacity to undertake complex reforms. They acknowledged the role that a new Fund
arrangement could play in supporting the authorities’ reform efforts taking into account the
small states’ challenges that Comoros is facing, and looked forward to early engagement on
this issue.

Statement by Mr. Ngueto Tiraina Yambaye, Executive Director
for Union of the Comoros and Mr. Sidi Bouna Mohamed,
Senior Advisor to the Executive Director
February 4, 2015
I.

Introduction
A coordinated effort by International Financial Institutions (IFIs), bilateral donors, and the
Comorian authorities, led to a meaningful improvement in Comoros’ macroeconomic
performance during the 2009-13 period under the ECF arrangement. The country also
achieved satisfactory progress on key structural reforms leading up to the HIPC completion
point in 2012 while making advancements on key social indicators. The IMF’s close
involvement along with the authorities’ resolve to undertake difficult reforms have enabled a
sound economic performance while also, importantly, helping catalyze donors’ support.
Since then, however, preserving hard-won macroeconomic gains has been challenging, and
progress on structural reforms has been limited.
The authorities acknowledge that in the short- and medium-term, part of regaining the reform
momentum requires the kind of “quick-win” measures recommended by staff, for example,
in the fiscal area. The authorities welcome the recommended measures and are taking the
necessary steps in the 2015 budget to address identified fiscal weaknesses. However, to
achieve more meaningful progress in other areas, there is a need to address a number of
uncompleted reforms initiated in the context of the 2009-13 ECF and leading up to the HIPC
completion point with the assistance of the donor community. This will require a stronger,
more sustained and coordinated involvement of IFIs and other development partners, as the
authorities lack the capacity, planning ability, and financial resources to finalize these
reforms on their own. This is especially true for the restructuring of the electricity company,
for example, which continues to exert a significant drag on the country’s growth potential.
Comoros’ distinctive features as a small island state also make the authorities’ task of further
enhancing growth particularly challenging. Limited natural resource endowment and a very
small market, inhibit the realization of economies of scale. Furthermore, Comoros lacks the
kind of dominant industries found in some other small island states such as tourism or a
financial sector. The economy is dominated by the public sector with no alternative engines
of growth coming from the private sector. Addressing these deep-rooted challenges requires
a comprehensive approach to the development of the country and progress will be dependent
on a strong and sustained involvement of donors. These structural weaknesses are generally
shared among small island states and require a unique approach to development with a
particular strong focus on growth compared to other LICs as noted in the “Staff Guidance
Note on the Fund’s Engagement with Small Developing States”1.

II.

Recent Developments and Outlook
-

Growth is estimated to have reached 3.3 percent in 2014 (from 3.5 percent in 2013) and is
projected to revert to 3.5 percent in 2015 driven by public investment which remains one
of the country’s main engines of growth.

-

Inflation remains in check within the 2.5-3 percent range on average in 2014 and 2015.
Stable and low domestic food and fuel prices and a prudent monetary policy stance
within the CFA zone have contributed to containing inflation.

-

The fiscal stance has deteriorated in 2014 due to the substantial drop in nontax revenues
―the previous Economic Citizenship Program (ECP) has been cancelled―, and to the
increase in teachers’ salaries despite a sizeable downward revision in capital spending. In
2015, the more limited use of tax exemptions along with cuts in goods and services
expenditures and also the postponement of domestically-financed capital expenditures are
projected to contribute to an improvement of the fiscal stance. On the new ECP, the
authorities remain confident that they will be able to reach an agreement soon. They
intend to discuss and seek advice from staff on how to optimize the use of these
resources, as soon as they become available.

-

While the current account deficit has declined in 2014 to 7.4 percent of GDP, it is
projected to widen to 11 percent in 2015 despite strong remittances inflows. This
development is driven by high imports associated with the public investment program.
Consequently, international reserves are projected to decline from 5.6 months of imports
cover in 2014 to 4.9 months in 2015.

-

Outlook: the near-term outlook is mostly affected by the country’s limited fiscal space
and the associated reduction in capital spending along with long-standing weaknesses in
the electricity sector. The longer term outlook, however, appears more favorable as new
investments are launched in areas with comparative advantage such as tourism and
fisheries along with the resumption of other public investments, including domestically
financed.

III.

Policy Adjustments

Following the 2014 fiscal slippages, the authorities have welcomed the staff’s advice and
recommendations aimed at redressing the situation. They have adopted a 2015 budget that
aligns more closely revenues ―based on more realistic assumptions― and expenditures
―better prioritized― while limiting recourse to statutory advances from the central bank
―which are contained by the ceiling under the CFA zone arrangements― with the goal of
ultimately eliminating arrears both domestic and external. The focus of this year’s budget is
also to further limit the wage bill.
An important long-term fiscal challenge the authorities have been struggling with over the
years is raising the country’s revenue-to-GDP ratio. They welcome the annex on this issue

3

which will contribute towards this endeavor, and agree, in particular, with the foremost need
to contain revenue leakages through the “freeze of the granting of any new customs and tax
exemptions”. They also welcome the critical quick-win revenue administration reforms
identified, and would like to reiterate their commitment to implementing all of the
recommended measures.
The authorities also acknowledge weaknesses in PFM and welcome the recommended quickwin PFM reforms, including the “control of the government wage bill through the
enforcement of a ceiling for each of the Union and the three islands” which they intend to
fully implement.
The authorities very much appreciate the findings of the DSA update that take into
consideration the impact of remittances, and indicate a revision of the rating from high to
moderate of the country’s risk of debt distress. They would like to reiterate their commitment
to seeking borrowing on concessional terms only, and continuing to address debt
management weaknesses with the technical assistance of the IMF and other development
partners.
IV.

Small Island State
My authorities welcome the acknowledgement by staff of the country’s significant structural
obstacles to growth and, in particular, the challenges with efforts to diversify the economy, as
a result of the country’s very narrow resources base (3 crops ―vanilla, cloves, and ylangylang― account for approximately 75 percent of all exports). Comoros is also a very small
market which is further fragmented by the limited transport and communication links
between the three islands that constitute the Union.
The authorities appreciate the efforts by staff to recommend realistic policy measures and
reforms in their discussions, as stressed in the report, cognizant of the country’s limited
capacity for implementing comprehensive and far-reaching reforms.
However, it is also clear from the staff’s analysis that devising and implementing a realistic
and successful diversification strategy is beyond the reach of the authorities, and will require
a strong involvement from development partners.
V.

Conclusion

In spite of a challenging environment, Comoros, with the much-appreciated assistance of
development partners, has been able to achieve satisfactory economic and financial progress,
over the past years. However, much remains to be done. My Comorian authorities are eager
to undertake the efforts needed to raise economic growth, improve the standards of living of
the population and place Comoros on a sustainable economic and financial path. In this
endeavor, the assistance of developing partners is of vital importance as Comoros has neither
the technical nor financial capacity to undertake such reforms on its own. My authorities look
forward to embarking on a medium-term program of reforms. Above all, they would like to

4

implement a program of adjustment with the Fund’s assistance, under an ECF arrangement.
My authorities believe that such an arrangement with a particular focus on addressing the
country’s structural impediments to growth would help catalyze the needed donor
involvement to address the country’s macroeconomic and structural challenges. They look
forward to the Board’s support for the start of rapid discussions with staff to address these
challenges under a new ECF.
