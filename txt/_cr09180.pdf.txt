EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background and Challenges: The global financial crisis, the collapse of CL Financial Group, and the
devastating impact of Hurricane Omar are creating the perfect economic storm. After growing by
3.2 percent in 2008, St. Kitts and Nevis’ real output is projected to contract by 1.2 percent in 2009,
with risks clearly on the downside. The government has shown its commitment to debt reduction by
achieving a large primary surplus in 2008 for the fourth consecutive year, with the public debt ratio
down by 20 percentage points over the past three years. But the country’s still heavy debt burden has
left no space for fiscal policy to respond to the downturn. Liquidity risks posed by the large rollover
needs of short-term debt have also risen. Financial sector vulnerability stems from banks’ continued
high government exposure and inadequate supervision of the nonbank sector.
Key Policy Recommendations: Sustaining large primary surpluses over the medium term will require
continued and strengthened expenditure control, together with further structural fiscal reforms,
including, most critically, the VAT. Other key policy actions include: tightening oversight of the
broader public sector; working closely with donors/creditors to tap grants or highly concessional
loans; strengthening debt management capacity; strengthening financial sector regulations; and
accelerating land/asset sales to lower debt more rapidly. In the current environment, developing a fullfledged contingency plan has also become more urgent.
External Competitiveness: The real effective exchange rate and medium-term current account deficits
are broadly in line with fundamentals, but maintaining competitiveness remains a challenge. Fiscal
consolidation will be important for supporting competitiveness, maintaining stability, and
underpinning the quasi-currency board arrangement.
Request for Fund Financing: The authorities have made a request for a purchase under the Fund’s
Emergency Assistance for Natural Disasters (ENDA) equivalent to 25 percent of quota
(SDR 2.225 million). Fund financing is expected to partly offset the balance of payments impact of
Hurricane Omar, estimated at almost US$19 million.

I. CONTEXT
1.
Over the past decade, economic developments in St. Kitts and Nevis have been
shaped by the need to respond to a series of shocks—a succession of hurricanes in the late
1990s; the sharp drop in tourism after the September 11 attacks; and the closure of the
loss-making sugar industry, a mainstay of the economy for more than three centuries. Fiscal
policy typically responded through reconstruction and social programs to maintain
employment and limit the social impact of these shocks. The result was an accumulation of
public debt, with the debt ratio peaking in 2005 at 197 percent of GDP, among the highest in
the world.
2.
Now the country faces another, perhaps even larger, exogenous shock in the
form of the global financial crisis. The sharp global recession has been taking a toll on the
St. Kitts and Nevis economy. Economic activity has weakened markedly, particularly
tourism and FDI-related construction, the drivers of growth in recent years. The drop-off in
tourism receipts, FDI, and other capital flows could lead to a worsening of the balance-ofpayments position. Strains from the global crisis are also increasingly evident in the local
financial system, including through insurance, investment, and banking linkages with the
troubled Trinidad-based CL Financial Group. Should the slowdown deepen further, the
adverse impact could spread to the banking sector through a rise in nonperforming loans and
a loss of confidence.
3.
But the major risk to macroeconomic stability stems from the very high level of
debt and associated large financing requirements. Although the public debt ratio has
fallen markedly since 2005, it is still excessively high, and debt service takes up nearly a
quarter of government revenues. Moreover, access to external financing is now extremely
limited, forcing the government to increasingly rely on the already heavily exposed banking
system to meet the large rollover needs.

a reflection of the government’s
focus on improving living standards. However, the global financial crisis is already
threatening these gains, with layoffs and shortened workweeks accelerating across an
increasingly wide spectrum of the economy.

5.
St. Kitts and Nevis form a twin-island federation with a unicameral parliament,
with parliamentary elections due by October 2009. The incumbent Labor Party won a

5
third consecutive five-year term in the October 2004 elections, while the Nevis Reformation
Party returned to power in Nevis in July 2006 after 14 years in opposition. The political cycle
is complicating the needed decisions to pursue fiscal consolidation and structural reforms.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK
6.
Economic activity slowed down significantly in the wake of the deteriorating
global environment. Real GDP growth for 2008 is estimated at about 3.2 percent, despite
slower growth in the second half of the year as tourism declined. The impact of the global
downturn is expected to take full effect in 2009, adversely impacting both tourism and
construction (via slower FDI inflows). Furthermore, in October 2008, Hurricane Omar’s
storm surge severely damaged Nevis’ largest tourism resort, the mainstay of the island’s
economy, and is likely to remain closed during 2009 (Section III). Real GDP is, therefore,
projected to contract by 1.2 percent in 2009, with the decline tempered by continued
construction of some high-end resorts in St. Kitts, the expansion of the medical and nursing
schools, the opening of a new horse racing

are clearly on the downside.

7.
The global surge in food and fuel
prices led to a pick-up in inflation from
2.1 percent at end-2007 to a peak of
8.3 percent in October 2008, before
moderating somewhat to 7.6 percent by
end-2008. Inflation is projected to ease
further in 2009 on the back of lower oil
prices.

8.
Monetary developments also reflected the economic slowdown. Broad money
growth fell to 2.2 percent in 2008 from 11.2 percent during 2007, while growth of private
sector credit also slowed to 7.5 percent by end-2008 from 9.2 percent a year earlier.
9.
Reflecting strong FDI-related
imports, the current account deficit
widened to 24 percent of GDP in
2007. This was more than fully financed
by tourism-related FDI (30 percent of
GDP). The current account deficit in
2008 is expected to widen to about
29 percent due to lower tourism
receipts, but the deficit is projected to
narrow substantially (about

7 percentage points) in 2009, as the decline in tourism receipts is more than offset by a sharp
drop in FDI-related imports.
10.
Prudential indicators point to some weakening of the banking system, which also
remains vulnerable to high public sector exposure (Figure 1). While liquidity in the
banking system remained ample through 2008, the nonperforming loans (NPLs) ratio rose by
1 percentage point over the course of the year to 5.2 percent, slightly above the ECCB’s
prudential target of 5 percent.1 Gross government exposure to total capital of the banking
system stood at an uncomfortably high 207 percent at end-2008, with the banking system’s
public sector exposure at 51 percent of total loans. For locally incorporated banks, public
sector exposure was even higher, at 79 percent of total loans.
11.
In 2008, the government achieved a primary surplus for the fourth consecutive
year, with the surplus estimated at

retroactive to January 2008 (estimated to cost 0.9 percent of GDP). Government measures to
compensate for the high food and fuel prices (including removing the consumption tax on
critical food items) were estimated to cost about 0.3 percent of GDP.
12.
Despite passage of the Financial Administration Act in 2008, there remains little
current information on the financial accounts of the broader public sector. However, the
share of public enterprises’ debt in total public sector debt remains substantial, at 22 percent
as of end-2008.

The 2004 ECCU FSSA noted that there were some problems with loan classification by locally-incorporated
banks in the ECCU, particularly with regard to public sector debt, so the actual NPL ratio could be higher.

Although it has fallen by about 20 percent of GDP since 2005, the public debt
ratio is still 178 percent of GDP (Figure 3). Most critically, debt service costs have
increased about threefold over the past decade, and the government is under increasing
stress to meet debt service obligations. Liquidity risks posed by the large rollover needs of
short-term debt have also risen in the current difficult climate. Interest payments alone
represented 24 percent of total government revenue in 2008, crowding out social and other
development-related spending and leaving little room for maneuver to respond to adverse
shocks. Borrowing from commercial banks—increasingly in the form of tapping the
expensive overdraft facility (with interest rates and penalties as high as 11.5 percent)2—has
exacerbated the heavy debt service burden. Interest payments are expected to swell from
about 8 percent of GDP in 2007 to 15 percent in 2014.

Parliament passed a resolution in March 2009, in compliance with the Finance Administration Act, to allow
the government to access the overdraft facility up to EC$150 million. The resolution’s passage eliminated the
2 percent penalty charged on the overdraft facility.

several years. As a result, the overdraft in the domestic banking system by mid-2008 was
more than halved from 23 percent of GDP at end-2007. However, the sharp drop in the
overdraft was not fully reflected as a decline in the banking system’s exposure, as about half
of the bond was purchased by a local indigenous bank, and another large portion was
bought by the Social Security Board, also heavily exposed to the government. Since
July 2008, banking exposure has been on the increase again. The government has returned
to tapping the overdraft, reflecting the government’s limited access to other forms of
financing. This increase was briefly reversed in January 2009, when the €5.4 million sugar
grant from the EU was used to pay down the overdraft, before returning to a rising trend.
III. ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THE HURRICANE
15.
St. Kitts and Nevis, particularly the island of Nevis, has been badly affected by
Hurricane Omar, which passed the region over the period of October 16–17, 2008.
Severe damage was caused by the extremely high storm surge, which flooded the major
tourism resort on Nevis and caused some destruction to the federation’s roads and coastal
infrastructure. The impact of the hurricane unfolded very slowly, with the hotel initially
estimated to be closed for about six months. However, substantial redesign of the
property—to avoid future flooding—is now expected to keep it closed for much longer.
16.
The damage caused by Hurricane Omar contributed to the economic slowdown
in St. Kitts and Nevis in 2008 and could depress growth by about 1 percentage point in
2009. The impact will be more severe in Nevis as the decline in economic activity spills
over to other sectors like agriculture and light manufacturing that supply the tourism sector.
The closure could also affect airlift. The impact on unemployment will also be significant,
since the damaged hotel is the largest employer in Nevis.3
17.
The fiscal impact for Nevis is expected to be reflected in a sharp decline in tax
revenues. Staff’s preliminary estimates suggest that total revenue of the Nevis Island
Authority (NIA) would decline by about 1.5 percent of GDP in 2009 from the previous year
due to the combined impact of the global downturn and the damage from Hurricane Omar.
Hotel room and restaurant tax accounted for about 13 percent of NIA’s budget revenue, and
the resort’s closure is expected to have a direct impact of about EC$8 million on tax
revenue (0.5 percent of GDP) over a 12-month period.

Over 600 employees have already been laid off.

The balance of payments impact of the hurricane, estimated at EC$50 million
(3½ percent of GDP), will be felt mostly in 2009. The resort’s closure is estimated to

reflecting a decline in
imports as fewer visitors are accommodated and a decline in spending of displaced workers,
partially offset by higher imports for rehabilitation of the hotel, road repairs, and
strengthening sea defenses. There will be no offsetting inflows of insurance payments as
these have been impounded by the bank holding the resort’s mortgage. The balance of
payments impact is equivalent to about one month of 2008 imports.
19.
The authorities are attempting to address the effects of the hurricane, but face
severe financing constraints. Immediate relief has already been provided to those affected
by the natural disaster, and repair to damaged infrastructure has been largely completed.
The government is also taking steps to cushion the impact on the displaced workers by
ensuring they receive severance benefits and facilitating alternative employment. Moreover,
as discussed in Section IV, the authorities are developing a comprehensive economic
program—aimed at strengthening public finances to reduce public debt ratios, while
undertaking structural reforms to help reactivate the economy—to deal with the effects of
the natural disaster within the context of the difficult economic situation facing the country.
The slow unfolding of the effects have stretched the finances of the NIA, which has had to
bear most of the cost, as assistance from development partners has not been forthcoming.
Furthermore, although the country participates in the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance
Facility (CCRIF), wind speed, not flooding, is the trigger for an insurance payout, so
St. Kitts and Nevis could not benefit from this source of financing. This situation is
complicated by the tight constraints on central government finances.

13
IV. POLICY DISCUSSIONS4
Discussions centered on adopting bold adjustment polices for restoring fiscal and debt
sustainability, mitigating vulnerabilities, and enhancing competitiveness and growth, all in
the context of the most difficult global environment in decades. The authorities and staff
were in broad agreement on the approach for addressing these challenges, but recognized
that implementation risks were high.
A. Restoring Fiscal and Debt Sustainability
20.
The government reiterated its commitment to an ambitious medium-term
strategy. The strategy, first elaborated in the 2006 Budget, aims at raising the central
government primary surplus to 8 percent of GDP by 2010 and placing debt on a sustainable
path. Over the recent past, the authorities have already taken crucial steps toward this goal,
including decisive actions to close the state sugar company to stem further losses,
strengthen tax administration (the tax-to-GDP ratio is now among the highest in the region),
and implement an automatic fuel pricing mechanism. The market-valuation-based property
tax, adopted at the beginning of 2008 (with assessments nearly completed), is expected to
further enhance the tax base. The authorities recognized the need for greater expenditure
control and prioritization, but noted the pressure on government spending this year to
address the impact of the global recession. Staff stressed that there is little room for countercyclical fiscal measures due to the very high debt level.
21.
Based on current policies
and the 2009 budget parameters
(the “baseline” scenario), the
primary surplus is projected to
decline to about 2.4 percent of
GDP. The surplus falls
considerably short of the
government’s goal (Box 1). Staff,
therefore, recommended the
adoption of additional adjustment
measures (the “active” scenario)
aimed at achieving primary

The discussions took place from March 9–20, 2009. The team comprised N. Wagner (Head), W. Samuel,
Y. Wong (all WHD), and M. Anthony (MCM) and was joined by staff of the ECCB and the CDB.
G. Purves (OED) participated in the final meetings. The team met with Prime Minister Douglas,
Deputy Prime Minister Condor, Minister of Finance Harris, Nevis Premier Parry, other senior officials, and
representatives of the trade unions and the private sector.

14
Box 1: The 2009 Budget
Policy Initiatives. Both governments emphasized their commitment to reduce public debt to
sustainable levels, with public debt projected to fall from 169 percent of GDP at end-2008 to
165 percent of GDP at end-2009.1 The medium-term strategy includes: refocusing the Fiscal
Stabilization Program on debt reduction; committing to land sales and privatization to
generate EC$50–100 million per year (3−7 percent of GDP); cutting expenditure through
rationalization of public sector employment; greater prioritization of capital projects and
funding capital expenditure through concessional financing (to the extent possible) over the
next five years; and reducing interest rate costs in part through the issuance of treasury bills on
the Regional Government Securities Market (RGSM).
Key fiscal measures of the two budgets for 2009 include:
•

Providing immediate relief to the tourism sector. With effect from January 1, 2009,
small hotels are exempted from duty and consumption tax on food and beverage. Nevis
is also establishing a Tourism Contingency Fund, through an additional 1 percent
charge on the hotel accommodation tax, to assist hotels that are under financial stress
from external shocks. The Cabinet also approved a Special Incentives Package for
small hotels with incentives such as duty free concessions for refurbishment.

•

No new taxes for 2009, although the government indicated they might consider
introducing “billable services” in customs and raising some government service
charges. Fiscal measures introduced in 2008 to alleviate the effect of higher food and
energy prices—such as the exemption of the consumption tax on selected food items
and the cap on the fuel surcharge to 50 percent—would remain in place. The VAT is
being considered for possible introduction in 2010.

Fiscal Outlook. The government’s consolidated 2009 budget projects an overall primary
surplus of 5.3 percent of GDP, larger than staff’s baseline projection of about 2.4 percent. The
budget’s current revenue projections for 2009 are based on gains from strengthening tax
administration and real GDP growth of 3 percent, in contrast to staff projections of a
pronounced contraction by 1.2 percent.

In contrast, staff foresees public debt rising from 178 percent of GDP at end-2008 to close to about
186 percent by end-2009 under the baseline scenario.

Key expenditure measures would include:

•

Civil service reform. Staff encouraged the government to press ahead with their plans
for comprehensive civil service reform. With the government wage bill among the

external competitiveness.

•

Goods and services. Tight control over spending on goods and services is key to fiscal
consolidation with, at a minimum, growth in expenditure kept in line with inflation.

16
•

Electricity department. Staff supported the government’s plans to corporatize the
electricity department, stressing that it should be completed as soon as feasible to
remove the substantial drain on the budget (the shortfall was estimated to amount to
almost 2 percent of GDP in 2007, and the revenue loss arising from the 50-percent cap
on the electricity fuel surcharge since January 2008 was estimated to amount to
0.6 percent of GDP). Thus, under the active scenario, it is assumed that corporatization
occurs in early 2010, while the baseline scenario assumes further delays, pushing back
corporatization until early 2011.

•

Targeted support. Given the limited fiscal space, staff commended the government for
taking the initial steps, as part of the institutional strengthening effort, toward targeted
support of the most vulnerable. It also recommended moving as quickly as feasible to
put this in place and phasing back in the consumption taxes by end-year. Should this
prove politically difficult, staff suggested raising excise taxes and expediting the
implementation of the VAT to replace the lost revenues.

•

Capital expenditure. Continued efforts to streamline and prioritize capital spending over
the medium term are critical for fiscal consolidation. Prioritization should be based on
rigorous cost-benefit analysis and availability of appropriate financing (grants or highly
concessional financing), supported by a strengthened PSIP process.

24.
•

Staff supported plans to push ahead with additional fiscal revenue reforms:
Value-added tax (VAT). A VAT would broaden coverage of the tax system, while
consolidating a range of taxes under a single framework (including fully replacing the
current consumption tax). Successful implementation should allow for some increase in
revenues to more than offset the potential revenue losses from the elimination of tariff

17
under the Phase IV of the Common External Tariff (CET) under CARICOM. Progress
has been made in terms of the VAT team (comprising staff from both islands), which
began preparatory work in December 2008. Critical to success, however, will be a
unified regime administered at the federal level with effective revenue-sharing between
St. Kitts and Nevis, and staff urged the two island governments to quickly agree on a
solution on this core aspect necessary for advancing implementation.
•

Tax concessions. St. Kitts and Nevis has relied heavily on tax concessions, among the
highest in the region, to attract investment. Thus, staff welcomed the authorities’ work
on preparing a new Investment Code that would specify a transparent, nondiscretionary
regime for providing investment incentives based on projected economic return.

•

Corporate income tax. Staff endorsed the plan to introduce a new Corporate Tax Act,
with the aim of modernizing the existing Income Tax Act enacted some 40 years ago.
Together with the Investment Code, the new Act could also help limit the room for
granting tax concessions.

25.

Further fiscal efforts would facilitate achievement of policy goals:

•

Strict enforcement of the new Finance Administration Act. Combined with stronger
control of borrowing by public enterprises, this will be a core element toward achieving
debt sustainability. The process of providing debt guarantees for public enterprises
should be strengthened, including by requiring full and timely submission/disclosure of
financial statements and setting explicit debt limits. Strengthening of debt control and
management within the public enterprises could also pave the way for privatization of
those deemed viable under commercial operations. In all events, using land as collateral
for public enterprise borrowing should be strictly avoided.

•

Strengthening debt management capacity. The government is rightly focused on this
area of reform. As a starting point, the debt unit has made much progress in compiling a
comprehensive government debt database, although weaknesses remain regarding the
timely inclusion of debt of public enterprises and the NIA. The government also
employed a private debt consultant and received Fund technical assistance (Box 2), with
the aim of developing a medium-term debt management strategy, building capacity
within the debt unit to undertake debt sustainability and debt strategy analyses, and
exploring options to reduce the debt burden. Also crucial is strengthening institutional
arrangements for debt management, including enhancing coordination and information
dissemination among ministries and both island administrations.

26.
While running primary surpluses is necessary for restoring debt sustainability,
it will not be sufficient. The government is also pursuing other options to more rapidly
lower the public debt and the economy’s vulnerability to external shocks. These, together

18

Box 2: Debt Management
St. Kitts and Nevis’ high public debt poses a serious risk to the economy. This risk is
compounded by the susceptibility of the economy to external shocks, including the current
global slowdown. At the authorities’ request, a Fund mission visited the country in
October 2008 and provided technical advice on how to address these risks, including actions
to restore debt sustainability and strengthen the institutional framework for debt management.
Among the mission’s recommendations:
¾ Restore debt sustainability. Although the authorities’ recent fiscal efforts have resulted
in a fall in the public debt ratio, current policies imply a resumption of an upward trend and
the emergence of financing gaps. In the absence of prompt corrective action, a debt
restructuring might become unavoidable. A substantial increase in the primary surplus to
around 8 percent of GDP would be needed to place debt firmly on a downward path. Pushing
ahead with land sales to the private sector would be a critical component. Delaying land sales
in anticipation of appreciating land values seems very risky in light of pressing liquidity needs.
While the assets of the Social Security Board (SSB) help to ameliorate the public debt
situation, in fact, the majority of its assets are invested in public sector debt; the sale of land
to the SSB (as happened in 2008) and the SSB’s move into real estate development in 2009
eventually reduce public sector liquidity.
¾ Rationalize the structure of public liabilities. Simplifying the structure of the public
debt would help to improve control and reduce risks. The complexity and nontransparency of
the cross-liabilities and guarantees among various parts of the pubic sector, including the
federal and Nevis governments, public corporations, the SSB and the state-owned bank, may
have facilitated the rise in public debt. The currently very high exposure of the banking system
to public debt would be reduced by direct government borrowing from the SSB rather than
channeling the resources through the state-owned bank. Moreover, the SSB’s integrity could

be improved by reducing its exposure to public corporations whose operations appear
to be quasi-fiscal. Nevertheless, borrowing from the SSB is a second-best financing
option, driven by necessity rather than optimality.
¾ Strengthen debt management capacity and institutional arrangements. As a first
step, the government should identify its debt management objectives. These would provide
the basis for the formulation and implementation of a medium-term debt management strategy
and help to identify and manage financial risks. It is also important to develop urgently the
capacity to analyze, manage, and control guarantees. A Public Debt Committee, chaired by
the Minister of Finance, with the participation of the ECCB as appropriate, should be
established with the responsibility for approving the debt strategy and the associated annual
financing plan. To facilitate more rigorous analysis of debt service cash flows, a single
integrated database for recording all public debt should be created.

19
with accelerated structural reforms, are key features of the active scenario (with more
productive private investment and higher real growth over the medium term):
•

Land/asset sales. The government may be cash-constrained, but it is asset-rich with
considerable land, some of which secures the sugar debt in the banking system. There
was broad agreement on aiming for land sales to the private sector at about 3 percent of
GDP per year (although the global downturn might make this target difficult to meet this
year), with sales proceeds used to pay down the most expensive public debt first. The
establishment of a land sales agency should be given top priority, with the goal of
putting in place a transparent, market-based procedure for the sale of land.

•

Concessional resources. The authorities met the conditions for the first tranche of the
CDB’s policy-based loan and the first disbursement of the EU’s pledged sugar grants
(2–3 percent of GDP per year through 2014). The government plans to continue
working closely with the CDB and the EU to meet the remaining requirements
(Table 9)—such as progress with the labor market assessment, the country poverty
assessment, and the national adaptation strategy—for further disbursements of the EU
sugar assistance.5 As with land sales proceeds, these resources would be used to pay
down the most expensive public debt.

27.
The active scenario is, nevertheless, subject to substantial downside risks. Due
to very limited fiscal room for maneuver, any exogenous shock could raise debt to much
higher levels (Annex I and Figures 6 and 7). Growth may also remain stagnant under the
backdrop of a more severe or prolonged global downturn than currently projected.
Moreover, land sales of 3 percent of GDP per year, as under this scenario, may prove too
optimistic against the difficult global environment and popular resistance. Under these more
pessimistic scenarios, the decline in the debt ratio is much slower and could even be
reversed in some years but would still be significantly lower than that under the baseline
scenario.
B. Enhancing Competitiveness and Fostering Growth
28.
Restoring growth to its medium-term potential will help accelerate the
reduction in the public debt-to-GDP ratio and improve living standards. While the
level of the real effective exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals (Box 3),
external competitiveness remains a challenge. Recent minimum and government wage
increases have been directed at mitigating the effects of the commodity price shocks, but
have kept private sector and government wage levels among the highest in the region.
Moreover, St. Kitts and Nevis has given up some of the recent gains in the share of the
Caribbean tourist market since 2006 (Figure 4).6
5

Fulfilling these conditions would also be necessary for the United Kingdom’s DFID to write off £2.3 million
in debt under the Commonwealth Debt Initiative.

6

Tourism arrivals declined in 2007 following a 1.6 percent increase in 2006, compared to double-digit growth
in 2003–05 after the opening of a large Marriott resort in 2003.

20
Box 3. Assessment of External Stability
The real effective exchange rate (REER) does not appear to be misaligned. Staff analysis
suggests that the REER is broadly in line with macroeconomic fundamentals.1 Through

The authorities reaffirmed their commitment to advancing reforms to the
business climate and the labor market, aimed at providing a conducive environment
for vibrant private sector-led growth. The following reforms would be key to achieving
this goal and would help St. Kitts and Nevis take advantage of opportunities under the
recently signed Economic Partnership Agreement with the EU:
•

Business climate. Reflecting recent steps to lower the cost of doing business,
St. Kitts and Nevis now ranks 67th out of 181 countries on the World Bank’s 2009
Doing Business Indicators survey (Figure 5). Simplifying procedures for starting and
closing businesses, strengthening contract enforcement, and improving the availability
of credit information would help improve the country’s ranking among the OECS and
internationally. The establishment of the St. Kitts Investment Promotion Agency
(SKIPA) as a one-stop shop for investors is highly commendable, but adopting an
Investment Code should be expedited.

•

The role of government. It is important that the public sector facilitates private-sectorled growth by removing infrastructure bottlenecks and creating a supportive
environment. Corporatization of the electricity department and water services, as well as
comprehensive reform of the civil service, are all critical for achieving this goal.

•

Labor market. The window of opportunity given by the slowing implementation of
large-scale investment projects should be used to implement measures to avoid the
future emergence of labor shortages, including strengthening vocational and technical
education making the labor market more flexible (firing costs in St. Kitts and Nevis are
the highest in the region), and supporting initiatives to improve labor mobility within the
Caribbean Single Market and Economy (CSME).

•

Regional integration. Deepening regional cooperation would assist in taking full
advantage of recent trade agreements; facilitate the movement of goods, services and
labor; and lower the cost of providing government services.
C. Mitigating Vulnerability

30.
Financial sector risks have intensified recently. The failure and subsequent
intervention of CL Financial Group have sent shockwaves through the Caribbean financial
sector,7 exposing weaknesses in the region’s regulatory framework for nonbanks. The
government has appropriately adopted an open communication policy about the risks
involved, and this should ultimately help to underpin confidence about the government’s
efforts to resolve the problems. In the banking sector, nonperforming loans have begun to

increase following a period of rapid credit growth, as a slowing economy and employment
losses constrain repayment capacity. Key risks include:
•

about the safety and soundness
of financial institutions, any
disruption of government payment capacity could create severe problems in the banking
system.

•

The liquidity squeeze. The social security system, which is currently generating large
surpluses (albeit much reduced this year owing to employment losses), has been one of
the major financiers of the government, either directly through loans and treasury bills or
indirectly through the banking system and land sales. The hitherto large deposits of the
social security system have provided a ready source of liquidity to the banking system.
Recently, however, this source of liquidity has been reduced, as the Social Security Board
(SSB) has changed its investment strategy away from fixed deposits (mostly in the
indigenous banks) and toward real estate development, together with some essentially
quasi-fiscal activities. This will markedly reduce the extent of financing available to the
government from the banking or social security systems at a time when alternative
sources of financing are becoming scarce.

•

The nonbank financial sector. The intervention of CL Financial Group and the fraud
accusations against the Antigua-based Stanford International Bank highlight the risks of
lax regulatory frameworks for nonbanks.8 This sector had been growing rapidly, with the
high-interest-rate deposit-taking activities of associated insurance companies a clear red

25
flag. Deposits held on behalf of individuals in St. Kitts and Nevis now amount to
EC$120 million and, should there be a “run” on these deposits,9 the government could not
give a credible guarantee.
31.
The banking sector vulnerabilities warrant close monitoring of both the
domestic banking system and international markets. Frequent on-site inspections, stress
testing, enforcement of banking regulations,10 and development of a full-fledged contingency
plan are becoming ever more important, as is the need to monitor more closely developments
at the headquarters of foreign banks.
32.
Staff recommended the elimination of the intermediary role of the indigenous
bank between social security and the central government. Given the current paucity of
financing options, the government should consider borrowing directly from the social
security system and cease the SSB’s quasi-fiscal and real estate development activities. It is
crucial that this direct borrowing be only a temporary measure, transitioning as early as
feasible to a model where the SSB can once again independently choose how to invest its
assets. Of necessity, this arrangement must be transitory in order to preserve the long-term
viability of social security.
33.
Another component of the nonbank financial system—the offshore sector—is
currently under threat, but the authorities are taking steps to protect the sector. The
combination of the fraud accusations against the Stanford International Bank and the global
recession’s threat to advanced countries’ tax bases have led a number of OECD and
G-20 countries to begin a concerted effort to go after tax havens. St. Kitts and Nevis has been
included on the OECD’s list of tax havens. Were the offshore sector to be shut down, this
would be particularly harmful to the NIA’s already difficult fiscal situation, as this sector
provides about 10 percent of tax revenues. On the positive side, however, the preliminary
report of the Caribbean Financial Action Task Force (CFATF) for St. Kitts and Nevis
indicates a better evaluation than that of the last such evaluation. Moreover, the government
is working urgently to resolve any remaining issues highlighted in this most recent report.
This includes moving ahead quickly with the Tax Cooperation Act, the aim of which is to
exchange information with relevant countries to prevent the evasion of taxes by their
residents through the use of local offshore companies.
34.
From a longer term perspective, the mission welcomes the government’s plan to
have a Single Regulatory Unit (SRU) in place as soon as feasible in an effort to
9

Indeed, by mid-March, depositors and policyholders had requested EC$40 million in withdrawals from one of
the insurance companies, most of which was not accommodated.

10

In fact, if the overdraft facility continues to rise and to capitalize interest, this would effectively be
“evergreening” the loan, and it should be classified as a nonperforming loan (NPL). Enforcement of banking
regulations would require the bank to provision for these loans, thereby building a buffer in the event of a crisis.

26
strengthen the regulatory framework for nonbanks. This will be a crucial first step
toward closing the legal loopholes which allowed the type of regulatory arbitrage in which
insurance companies could engage in risky deposit-taking behavior while avoiding the
requirements placed on banks. Staff commended the government’s efforts to press ahead
with legislation which will expand the role of the Financial Services Commission (the staff
has already more than doubled in size) into a fully operational SRU, as well as early passage
of supporting legislation, such as the Insurance Act and Cooperatives Act.
35.
The confluence of recent events has greatly increased the economy’s
vulnerability, making contingency planning an urgent necessity. Restoring debt
sustainability is only part of the challenge to avoiding a debt crisis—financing needs also
have to be met on a continuous basis. If a debt and/or financial sector crisis were to occur, the
government should be well prepared to respond, particularly in light of the ECCB’s limited
role as a lender of last resort. A contingency/crisis preparedness plan should, therefore, be
top priority, taking into account various growth and asset sales scenarios, together with a
range of exogenous shocks (e.g., natural disasters, terms-of-trade shocks, elimination of
offshore banking sector), any of which could greatly impair the government’s ability to
service its debt. As a first step, the government should develop a set of emergency fiscal
measures (e.g., special levy on incomes, temporary import surcharge, nominal public sector
wage cut). The government should also continue to consult closely with its legal and
financial advisors regarding the design and implementation of a debt strategy and include
various scenarios in the contingency plan.
D. Risks to the Adjustment Strategy
36.
Aside from the challenging external environment, the main risks to the
authorities’ adjustment strategy include policy slippages, weak implementation
capacity, and the ever-present threat of natural disasters. The local financial market
could come under serious stress from the global turmoil, and the indirect adverse impact on
the real sector could be substantial. A more protracted global slowdown could further
exacerbate the weakening tourism sector and cause the postponement or outright cancellation
of FDI-financed projects. Reduced demand for local real estate could undermine the
government’s land sales strategy and plans for upscale tourism development, while
weakening bank portfolios. These, and the risks outlined below, underscore the urgency for
developing contingency plans.
•

Financing of the external current account deficit. FDI, external grants (mainly from the
EU), and other private flows constitute a large proportion of the financing for the current
account. Should these flows not materialize, commercial banks could be forced to reduce
their holdings of net foreign assets, increasing their vulnerability. Imports would fall,
further constraining output growth and contributing to explosive debt dynamics. A
liquidity squeeze could also complicate rolling over public sector external debt—about
EC$53 million (3½ percent of GDP) falling due in 2009.

27
•

Implementation risks. The active adjustment scenario is a very ambitious strategy, which
may face strong public resistance. The authorities’ resolve to implement this strategy
could be tested in the run up to the general elections due by October 2009. Limited
implementation capacity could also delay the achievement of some of their goals. With
this in mind, staff has encouraged the authorities to align their targets with those they
have established with other development partners like the CDB and the EU.

•

Natural disasters. A direct hit by a hurricane could severely derail the authorities’
economic strategy. Indeed, the impact of Hurricane Omar has already placed great strains
on the Nevis economy and its financial autonomy. Thus, the staff welcomed the
authorities’ emphasis on preparedness and more widespread use of insurance (including
as a participant in the CCRIF) for mitigating and managing natural disasters.11 More
effective oversight of insurance companies by the SRU would ensure that adequate
reinsurance contracts are in place.
V. ACCESS AND CAPACITY TO REPAY

37.
The authorities have requested a purchase for an amount equivalent to
SDR 2.23 million (25 percent of quota) under the Fund’s policy of ENDA. The
purchase—which represents approximately ½ percent of St. Kitts and Nevis’ 2009 GDP—
would help meet the immediate foreign exchange needs stemming from the disaster, thereby
mitigating a decline in external reserves.
38.
It is expected that St. Kitts and Nevis will be able to discharge its obligations
with the Fund in a timely manner. The public sector and external debt ratios had been
declining before the impact of Hurricane Omar, as a result of the authorities’ strong fiscal
efforts to maintain a primary surplus of more than 4 percent of GDP over the last four years.
However, the effects of the hurricane will likely contribute to the projected rise in debt
(Figure 6). An important source of vulnerability is the large gross financing needs of almost
30 percent of GDP during 2009–13, which could become more burdensome when the
repurchases for ENDA fall due in 2012 and 2013 (Figure 7 and Table 10). Nonetheless, in
staff’s view, these risks are mitigated by the government’s strong debt servicing record,
recent fiscal efforts to reduce the public debt ratio, and their commitment to generate even
larger surpluses over the medium term, coupled with land sales to help reduce public debt
levels.

11

However, the analysis in Y. Wong, A. Lemus, and N. Wagner, “Insuring Against Natural Disasters in the
Caribbean,” in the ECCU Selected Issues paper (IMF Country Report No. 09/176), suggests that St. Kitts and
Nevis’ insurance coverage under the CCRIF is much below the optimal level.

28
VI. STAFF APPRAISAL
39.
The global recession, the financial meltdown of CL Financial Group, and the
devastating impact of Hurricane Omar are creating the perfect economic storm for
St. Kitts and Nevis. On the heels of several years of robust growth driven by tourism and
construction, the economy is now set to contract, with risks clearly on the downside. And the
country’s heavy debt burden has left no space for fiscal policy to respond to these challenges.
40.
The authorities are rightly focused on restoring debt sustainability, with fiscal
adjustment the workhorse of the strategy. The government’s commitment to debt
reduction has been evidenced by the achievement of four consecutive years of large primary
surpluses, contributing to a substantive lowering of the public debt ratio. But this year will
prove much more challenging, with the debt ratio expected to rise again. Nevertheless, the
government should push ahead with their goal of sustaining even larger primary surpluses
over the medium term. This will require continued and strengthened expenditure control,
together with further structural fiscal reforms including, most critically, the VAT.
41.
But fiscal adjustment alone will not be sufficient to achieve debt sustainability.
The authorities appropriately aim to tighten oversight of the broader public sector; work
closely with donors/creditors to tap additional grants or highly concessional loans; strengthen
debt management capacity; put in place an effective single regulatory unit for the nonbank
financial sector; enhance regulation of the banking system; and accelerate land/asset sales to
lower debt more rapidly.
42.
Fiscal consolidation will also be important for supporting competitiveness,
maintaining stability, and underpinning the ECCU quasi-currency board arrangement.
Although the real effective exchange rate and medium-term current account balances are
broadly in line with fundamentals, maintaining competitiveness remains challenging,
particularly in light of the country’s high wage levels and the highly competitive tourism
market.
43.
Financial sector risks, both in the banking and nonbank sectors, merit
intensified monitoring. A much less benign global environment, limited access to external
credit markets, and the heavy exposure of the domestic banking system to the government
imply strong efforts, including enhanced supervision, are needed to mitigate risks. Recent
developments have also brought to light serious weaknesses in the nonbank financial
regulatory framework, particularly in the insurance sector. Staff welcomes the authorities’
imminent plans to put in place an effective single regulatory unit for the nonbank financial
sector.
44.
The difficult financial climate, combined with the country’s high vulnerability to
exogenous shocks, highlights the urgency of developing a full-fledged contingency/crisis
preparedness plan. Given the government’s large financing and rollover needs, a strong
adjustment program is all the more critical to help prevent a debt or financial crisis. But at the

29
same time, having at hand a detailed contingency plan, including a set of emergency fiscal
measures, would allow the government to respond quickly to various adverse scenarios,
avoiding the chaos often associated with unanticipated shocks.
45.
While the global downturn and heavy debt burden are likely to weigh heavily on
near-term growth, there is light at the end of the tunnel if appropriate policies are
implemented swiftly. If the authorities take serious action now and move forward with their
reform agenda—together with completion of some planned high-end tourism projects and
geothermal energy development in Nevis—real growth could potentially rise to 4 percent per
year or higher over the medium and longer terms, helping to secure the impressive social and
economic gains achieved in recent years.
46.
Staff supports the authorities’ request for a purchase under the Fund’s policy on
emergency assistance for natural disasters. Although Hurricane Omar struck in
October 2008, the full impact, due to the indefinite closure of a major tourism resort on
Nevis, has been slow to evolve. The staff’s support is based on the severe effect on the
economy and associated large balance of payment needs and the authorities’ commitment to
push ahead with an ambitious reform strategy focused on debt reduction. The large public
debt and the inherent vulnerability of this small-island economy pose some risks to the
Fund’s resources. Nonetheless, these risks are mitigated by the authorities’ exemplary record
of debt service on external obligations and their resolve to sustain fiscal consolidation, foster
private sector-led growth, and work closely with the Fund in pursuing their reform strategy.
47.
Data are broadly adequate for surveillance, but improvements in coverage and
timeliness in some areas would strengthen economic management. Considerable progress
has been made in improving the quality and coverage of fiscal and debt data, but further
improvements are needed in national accounts (particularly tourism data), fiscal data for
public enterprises, fiscal financing, and labor statistics.
48.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

30
Annex I. Medium-Term Fiscal Scenarios and Debt Sustainability Analysis
There is a high risk that current fiscal polices will contribute to an explosive public debt
path. While strong fiscal and structural adjustments could place debt on a downward
trajectory, debt would remain at uncomfortably high levels over the medium term.
This section considers two fiscal scenarios—baseline and active. Under the baseline
scenario, debt follows an explosive path, as delays in major reforms and insufficient control
of expenditure result in large financing gaps and an ever-rising public debt ratio. In contrast,
the active scenario, with sustained fiscal adjustment and structural reforms, debt trends
steadily downward, although the pace depends heavily on exogenous factors.
¾ Baseline scenario. Real growth is projected to contract by about 1.2 percent in 2009
before recovering to 2 percent in the medium term, reflecting delayed structural reforms,
including sluggish land/asset sales. On revenue, a VAT will be introduced in mid-2011 due
to slower-than-expected implementation, and tax concessions continue to be granted. On
expenditure, the electricity department is corporatized in early 2011, the wage bill as a share
of GDP remains constant, net lending continues, and capital expenditure as a share of GDP
trends up again in 2010. Under this scenario, the central government primary surplus will
hover around 1½ percent of GDP, resulting in large financing gaps. Public enterprises are
assumed to borrow mainly from domestic sources, while their debt ratio (as a percent of
GDP) is projected to be only marginally lower than that at end-2007, reflecting lax
enforcement and control despite passage of the Finance Administration Act. Total public
debt is projected to increase to above 200 percent of GDP by 2014.
¾ Active scenario. With accelerated structural reforms, including land/asset sales of
3 percent of GDP per year from 2010 (which contribute to more productive private
investment and with the proceeds fully used to pay down more expensive debt), real growth
is projected to increase to 4 percent over the medium term. On revenue, the VAT will be
introduced as envisaged in late 2010. Tax concessions are contained, and efforts to collect tax
arrears are strengthened. On expenditure, the electricity department is corporatized in early
2010, growth in the wage bill is capped in line with inflation, there is no net lending, and
capital expenditures are solely financed by resources freed up by EU sugar grants (with
disbursements of 2–3 percent of annual GDP during 2009–13). Under this scenario, the
central government primary balance will rise, reaching close to 8 percent of GDP by 2013.
Strict enforcement of the Finance Administration Act, combined with strong control of
borrowing by public enterprises, will lead to the projected decline of public enterprise
indebtedness from 40 percent of GDP in 2008 to around 32 percent by 2014. The overall
public debt is projected to decline steadily to under 140 percent of GDP by 2014.

31
The above active scenario is subject to substantial downside risks. In particular, any
exogenous shock could raise debt to much higher levels. Stagnant growth in the event of a
more severe or prolonged global downturn or lower land sales would also hamper debt
reduction. Under these more pessimistic scenarios, the decline in the debt ratio is much
slower and could even be reversed in some years but would still be significantly lower than
that under the baseline scenario.
The active scenario is modified as follows:
•

Disaster in 2009 and 2013. Reflecting the vulnerability to hurricanes, this assumes that
real growth is reduced by 5 percent in 2009 and 2013, respectively, and expenditure is
increased by 2–3 percent, while revenue declines by about 2 percent of annual GDP
during 2009–13.

•

Lower growth with land sales of 1 percent of GDP. This has the same fiscal path as the
active scenario but GDP growth and land sales remains at low levels as in the baseline
scenario.

•

Lower growth with land sales of 3 percent of GDP. This has the same fiscal path and
land sales as the active scenario but GDP growth declines as in the baseline scenario.

1/ Based on the current policy scenario. Shaded areas represent actual data. Individual shocks are permanent
one-half standard deviation shocks. Figures in the boxes represent average projections for the respective
variables in the baseline and scenario being presented. Ten-year historical average for the variable is also
shown.
2/ Permanent 1/4 standard deviation shocks applied to real interest rate, growth rate, and current account
balance.
3/ One-time real depreciation of 30 percent occurs in 2009.

Annex II. Summary of Appendices
The full appendices to this report are issued as a supplement.
Fund relations. St. Kitts and Nevis has no outstanding Fund resources. It is a member of the
Eastern Caribbean Currency Union (ECCU), which has a common central bank, the
Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB). The common currency, the EC dollar, has been
pegged to the U.S. dollar at the rate of EC$2.70 since July 1976. St. Kitts and Nevis has
accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Articles of Agreement.
The exchange system is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for
current international transactions.
Relations with the World Bank Group. The country assistance strategy (CAS) for
FY 2006−09 supports the region’s development through: (1) stimulating growth and
improving competitiveness; and (2) reducing vulnerability. There are three active
projects in St. Kitts and Nevis with a commitment of US$9.6 million of which
US$6.6 million has been disbursed: (i) Telecommunications and ICT Development Project,
(US$0.54 million) approved on May 12, 2005, to improve the access, quality, and use of
telecommunications and ICT services; (ii) Education Development Project (US$5 million)
approved in June 2003, to increase equitable access to secondary education and improve the
quality of the teaching and learning processes; and (iii) HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control
Program (US$4 million), approved in January 2003.
Relations with the Caribbean Development Bank. The CDB has approved loans of
US$169.6 million, of which US$135.1 million has been disbursed as of end-2008. Major
projects under implementation include: a basic education project; a natural disaster
management project; loans to Nevis Electricity Company (NEVLEC); the West Basseterre
bypass road project; a child development project; a policy-based guarantee; and a policy
based loan in support of policy and institutional reforms.
Statistical Issues. St. Kitts and Nevis has participated in the General Data Dissemination
System since October 2000 and its metadata are posted on the Fund’s Dissemination
Standards Bulletin Board. There are significant weaknesses in real, fiscal, and balance of
payments data. Data on GDP by type of expenditure are not available at constant prices,
while the data at current prices are not reliable due to weaknesses in estimating gross capital
formation. A new CPI with weights from the 2000 household survey has been introduced.
There are no data on labor market developments. Fiscal data are not reported for publication
in IFS. After 1994, the latest data published in the GFS Yearbook are for 2003 and 2006 only.
No data are available on the nonfinancial public sector. Data on external trade (especially
exports) are not comprehensive, as they omit important categories of goods. Most
components of the financial account also need improvement. There are no data on private
external debt.

Attachment: Letter of Intent
April 24th, 2009
Mr. Dominique Strauss-Kahn
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, N.W.
Washington, D.C. 20431
Dear Mr. Strauss-Kahn,
St. Kitts and Nevis, particularly the island of Nevis, has been badly affected by Hurricane Omar,
which passed the region over the period of October 16–17, 2008. Parts of the Federation suffered
significant damage to roads and coastal infrastructure from the impact of extremely high storm
surge. The major hotel on the island of Nevis, the Four Seasons Resort, which is the largest private
sector employer, is expected to remain closed until at least the end of 2009.
Additionally, tourism arrivals have declined by 80 percent in the last quarter of 2008 and this trend
is expected to continue during 2009. The initial estimate of the overall damage is about
EC$150 million, nearly 11 percent of GDP, including loss of external earnings through 2009 of
some EC$50 million, or 3½ percent of GDP. Our preliminary estimates suggest that growth in the
economy is likely to move into negative territory compared to marginally positive growth projected
prior to the hurricane. This follows very strong growth in the previous three years, reflecting strong
FDI inflows and tourism-related construction. The balance of payments will likely deteriorate
significantly despite the fall in international fuel prices, as tourism receipts fall sharply.
The impact of the hurricane has evolved very slowly. It was initially estimated that the Four
Seasons Resort would be closed for about six months. However, international insurers have
requested a substantial redesign of the property to avoid future flooding. This is now expected to
keep the property off the market for at least one year. In addition to the substantial shortfall of
tourism receipts, this would result in a significant loss of employment and government revenue—
both directly, and indirectly through lower economic activity.
The Government is dealing with the effects of the crisis on several fronts. In the short run, measures
have been introduced to ease the economic effects of the natural disaster by reprogramming
expenditure to repair and build critical infrastructure. The Government has also taken steps to
cushion the impact on the displaced workers by ensuring they receive their benefits from the hotel
and facilitating alternative employment.
More broadly, the Government is developing a comprehensive economic program to deal with the
twin issues of the fallout from the global slowdown and the effects of the natural disaster. The
program focuses on sustaining large fiscal primary surpluses to place public debt ratios on a

48
downward trajectory and undertaking structural reforms to help reactivate the economy. The
government remains committed to fiscal reforms, including implementation of the value added tax,
to boost revenues and strengthen the viability of public finances. The government will stay current
in all debt-service payments to creditors and accelerate the reduction in debt levels through
asset/land sales. As a first step, the Government will shortly establish an appropriately-staffed
agency to help expedite market-based sales of land to the private sector in order to achieve our debt
reduction targets.
Thus, the Government has reoriented its medium-term economic policies toward reducing public
debt, while pursuing structural reforms aimed at faster economic growth and lower poverty. With
the assistance of the European Union (EU), the Government is developing a growth and poverty
reduction strategy to guide its medium-term reform agenda. The Government believes that this
strategy will play a key role in achieving our policy objectives. The main priorities for reform will
be (i) strengthening fiscal policies to place debt on a firmly declining path; (ii) enhancing the
investment climate for private sector development, including through privatization of public assets;
(iii) and strengthening oversight of the financial sector.
The slow evolution of the effects precluded immediate donor assistance and, hence, the Nevis
Island Administration has had to bear the full brunt of the impact. Accordingly, the Government of
St. Kitts and Nevis requests a purchase equivalent to SDR 2.225 million (25 percent of quota) under
the Fund’s Emergency Natural Disaster Assistance. The purchase will help meet the immediate
foreign exchange needs stemming from the disaster, thereby easing pressure on our external
reserves and maintaining confidence in the external position.
It is hoped that the international financial community will support our efforts to restore economic
growth and the country’s social structure. We look forward to an early approval by the Fund of the
request for emergency assistance, and to accelerated and increased financial and technical assistance
from other donors, in particular the EU, the Caribbean Development Bank, the World Bank, and
governments.
The Government will continue to cooperate with the Fund in an effort to strengthen St. Kitts and
Nevis’ balance of payments situation and maintain economic stability. The Government does not
intend to impose new or intensify existing restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for
current international transactions, introduce new or intensify existing trade restrictions for balance
of payments purposes, or enter into bilateral payments agreements which are inconsistent with
Article VIII of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement.
Sincerely yours,
--------/s/-------Dr. the Hon. Timothy Harris
Minister of Finance

St. Kitts and Nevis is a member of the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB), which
manages monetary policy and the exchange system for its eight members. The common
currency, the Eastern Caribbean dollar, has been pegged to the U.S. dollar at the rate of
EC$2.70 per U.S. dollar since July 1976. In practice the ECCB has operated like a
quasi-currency board, maintaining foreign exchange backing of its currency and demand
liabilities of close to 100 percent. St. Kitts and Nevis accepted the obligations of Article VIII,
Sections 2, 3, and 4 in December 1984. The exchange system is free of restrictions on the
making of payments and transfers for current international transactions.
X.

Safeguards Assessment

Under the Fund's safeguards assessment policy, the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB)
is subject to a full safeguards assessment under a four-year cycle. The most recent

3
assessment was completed in July 2007 and concluded that the ECCB continues to have
appropriate control mechanisms in place, which have strengthened since the first safeguards
assessment completed in 2003. ECCB management places emphasis on good governance and
sound controls, and has enhanced the bank's transparency and accountability since the last
assessment, including publications of financial statements that comply with International
Financial Reporting Standards. The assessment made some recommendations to sustain the
ECCB’s safeguards framework going forward.
XI.

Last Article IV Consultation

St. Kitts and Nevis is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle. The last Article IV
consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on February 4, 2008. The staff report is
IMF Country Report No. 08/126, and the accompanying statistical appendix is
IMF Country Report No. 08/127.
XII.

FSAP Participation, ROSCs, and OFC Assessment

St. Kitts and Nevis participated in the regional ECCU FSAP conducted in September and
October 2003. The Financial System Stability Assessment is available at
www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2004/cr04293.pdf. A review of St. Kitts and Nevis
AML/CFT Assessment was conducted by a team of assessors representing the Caribbean
Financial Action Taskforce (CFATF) in September 2003.
XIII. Technical Assistance: (2005–Present)
Since 2005, St. Kitts and Nevis has benefited from technical assistance in the areas of tax
policy, tax administration, economic statistics, financial supervision and macroeconomic
management, both from IMF headquarters and the Caribbean Regional Technical Assistance
Centre (CARTAC).
•

Experts from CARTAC and the IMF’s Statistics Department (STA) advised the
Central Statistics Office on improving the national accounts, rebasing the consumer
price index, and developing export-import price indices. In response to a request
from the authorities, experts from CARTAC assisted in compiling separate
production-based measures of GDP for St. Kitts and Nevis.

•

Experts from CARTAC, the IMF’s Monetary and Capital Markets Department
(MCM), and the IMF’s Legal Department (LEG) advised the authorities on
strengthening financial regulation and supervision, including risk-based supervision.
With assistance from the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions in
Canada (OSFI), experts from CARTAC have provided technical assistance to the
ECCB on drafting the OECS Insurance Act. They have also, in conjunction with

4
LEG, provided technical assistance to the ECCB in finalizing the drafting of the
OECS Money Services business Act. Experts from CARTAC also assisted in the
development of the Single Regulatory Unit.
•

Experts from CARTAC and MCM also provided technical assistance on public debt
management to strengthen management capacity and develop a medium-term debt
strategy.

•

Experts from CARTAC, the IMF’s Fiscal Affairs Department (FAD) and LEG
provided assistance to improve cash management and tax administration—including
collection enforcement. Experts from CARTAC have also provided assistance in
Property Tax reform to move the property tax base from rental value to market
value, and in improving central government fiscal and debt data.

•

CARTAC, FAD and LEG are providing assistance for implementation of a
value-added tax (VAT). CARTAC and FAD have provided extensive assistance,
through frequent expert visits, to sensitize politicians and technicians from the
Ministry of Finance on the VAT. This provided a general explanation on VAT, a
VAT sensitivity study, and the main steps in its introduction. Experts from
CARTAC have assisted with the preparation of a VAT Implementation Project Plan,
and experts from LEG assisted in the drafting of the VAT and excise tax
legistration.

•

Experts from LEG also provided assistance in tax legislation in the areas of Social
Service Levy and Corporate Income Tax.

•

Experts from CARTAC provided assistance in the administration and design of a
new pension plan for public sector employees.

•

As part of the Stabilization and Adjustment Technical Assistance Program
(SATAP), St. Kitts and Nevis have benefited from capacity building in
macroeconomic analysis.

5
Appendix II. St. Kitts and Nevis: Relations with the World Bank Group
(As of March 6, 2009)
The World Bank’s Management presented to its Board the Eastern Caribbean Sub-Region
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), on September 13, 2005. The World Bank Group’s
strategy for the four years covered by this CAS (FY 2006–09) supports the sub-region’s
development agenda through two main pillars: (1) stimulating growth and improving
competitiveness; and (2) reducing vulnerability, by promoting greater social inclusion and
strengthening disaster risk management. Recognizing the Organization of the Eastern
Caribbean States (OECS) countries’ weakened creditworthiness due to high debt ratios, Bank
activities will focus on leveraging available donor grant financing. Following the
recommendations of the 2005 growth and competitiveness study for the OECS, IBRD and
IDA support would focus on providing technical and financial assistance for interventions to
support the two main pillars. The CAS proposes new commitments of US$103.4 million for
six borrowing member states of the OECS, including St. Kitts and Nevis. Planned IBRD
lending to St. Kitts and Nevis amounts to US$10 million under the high-case lending
scenario.
A. Projects
There are three active World Bank projects in St. Kitts and Nevis for commitment of
approximately US$9.6 million, of which approximately US$6.6 million has been disbursed.
The St. Kitts and Nevis Telecommunications and ICT Development Project, approved on
May 12, 2005 for US$0.54 million, aims at improving the access, quality, and use of
telecommunications and ICT services to achieve socioeconomic development in the OECS.
The project has the following four components: Component (1) will strengthen the national
and regional regulatory frameworks and promote additional competition in the
telecommunications sector. Emphasis will be given to capacity building of Eastern Caribbean
Telecommunications Authority (ECTEL) and the National Telecommunications Regulatory
Commissions (NTRCs) by providing them with assistance to revise the regional and national
sector legislation, and develop a modem interconnection regime. Component (2) will review
current universal access policy, create related guidelines, and provide financial support to
establish a Universal Service Fund (USF). Component (3) will improve growth and
competitiveness in ICT-enabled services through utilization of broadband infrastructure.
Component (4) will ensure management and administration of the overall project.
The St. Kitts and Nevis Education Development Project was approved in June 2003 for
US$5.0 million. The overall objective of this project is to build human capital which, in turn,
will contribute to the diversification of the economy and more sustainable growth. This
objective will be achieved by: (i) increasing equitable access to secondary education;
(ii) improving the quality of the teaching and learning process, with more direct interventions

6
at the school level and a focus on student-centered learning, and (iii) strengthening
management of the sector and governance of schools.
The HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Program, which was approved in January 2003
for US$4.0 million, is funded under the Multi-Country APL for the Caribbean Region, with
the following objectives: (i) curbing the spread of HIV/AIDS epidemic; (ii) reducing the
morbidity and mortality attributed to HIV/AIDS; (iii) improving the quality of life for
persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWAs); and (iv) developing a sustainable organizational
and institutional framework for managing the HIV/AIDS epidemic over the longer term.
B. Economic and Sector Work
Economic and Sector Work: The Bank has completed a series of analytical work relating to
public expenditure, fiscal and debt sustainability, growth and competitiveness, the financial
sector, public sector management, and social protection. The ongoing dissemination of these
reports represents a key instrument for policy dialogue with the OECS governments,
including St. Kitts and Nevis.
The Bank’s program in St. Kitts and Nevis is further supported by a comprehensive series of
completed, ongoing and planned analytical and advisory activities including the following:
“Towards a New Agenda for Growth”—OECS growth and competitiveness study (2005); An
OECS Skills Enhancement Policy Note (2006); a Caribbean Air Transport Report (2006); a
regional study on Crime, Violence, and Development: Trends, Costs, and Policy Options in
the Caribbean (2007); an OECS Private Sector Financing Study (2008); the OECS Tourism
Backward Linkages Study (2008); the report “Caribbean—Accelerating Trade Integration:
Policy Options for Sustained Growth, Job Creation and Poverty Reduction” (2009); a
CARICOM study on Managing Nurse Migration (ongoing) ;and a preparatory study aimed at
developing a Caribbean-wide Regional Energy Strategy (ongoing).

Appendix III: St. Kitts and Nevis—Relations with the Caribbean Development Bank
(As of December 31, 2008)
The Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) has approved loans totalling US$169.6 million, of
which US$34.5 million are undisbursed.
A. Major Projects
1.

Basic Education Project—to assist the Government of St. Kitts and Nevis (GOSKN)
in the provision and maintenance of a more appropriate learning environment for a
greater number of students in the system (including those with learning disabilities)
who are pursuing basic education at primary and secondary schools; and
enhancement of the education system in the areas of management, in particular,
planning, data collection and analysis, student assessment, school management,
curriculum development and pedagogy.

2.

West Basseterre By-Pass Road—to construct approximately 3.8 kilometres of road to
relieve traffic congestion in the city of Basseterre. The proposed road runs to the
north of Basseterre and along the boundary fence of the Robert L. Bradshaw
International Airport.

3.

Second Power Project—consists of the installation of a generator of approximate size
2.5MW and ancillary switchgear and the establishment of an operations facility at the
Nevis Electricity Company Limited (NEVLEC). The project will provide additional
generating capacity to satisfy projected electricity demand and to replace existing
engines that are past their useful life.

4.

Student Loan Scheme (Sixth Loan)—to assist the National Bank of St Kitts-NevisAnguilla in financing loans to students attending local, regional and extra-regional
institutions for programmes in technical, vocational and academic studies.

5.

Child Development Project—to provide a comprehensive framework for addressing
the care and protection of children and the reform of juvenile offenders. The project
will enhance the life chances of children in St. Kitts and Nevis by improving their
connectedness with the school system and providing rehabilitative care for those at
risk and those who have committed offences.

6.

Natural Disaster Management Project—to contribute to the rehabilitation of
economic infrastructure caused by Hurricane Lenny. The project consists of
rehabilitating 8.66 metres of sea defence structures with rock armouring and stone on
geo-textile sheeting; reconstruction of a reinforced concrete ramp; and repairs to other
infrastructure and public buildings. The project promotes the reduction of

9
vulnerability to natural disasters through support for the development and adoption of
mitigation policies, standards and practices.
7.

Policy-Based Guarantee—to support a bond issue of up to EC$150 million by the
Government to refinance high cost debt, thereby supporting ongoing macroeconomic
reforms and structural reforms in St. Kitts and Nevis. The refinancing would also
improve the debt dynamics, thus lowering the time path of the debt-to-GDP ratio.

8.

Policy-Based Loan—is intended to support policy and institutional reforms while
helping the Federal Government to improve debt dynamics by using the proceeds of
the loan to replace some of its high-cost debt. The policy reforms are designed to
improve public finance management, particularly budget management and revenue
systems, and public enterprise governance systems to achieve fiscal and debt
sustainability.

Appendix IV. St. Kitts and Nevis: Statistical Issues
Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance, although significant shortcomings in data
provision and data quality remain. St. Kitts and Nevis has been participating in the General
Data Dissemination System (GDDS) since October 2000, and its metadata are posted on the
Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB).
A. Real Sector
There are a number of deficiencies in the real sector statistics. GDP data by type of
expenditure are not available at constant prices, while the data at current prices are not
reliable due to weaknesses in estimating gross capital formation. Private final consumption
expenditure is estimated as a residual. A new CPI with weights from the 2000 household
survey has now been introduced. Monthly CPI data are reported regularly but with a long lag.
Detailed data on tourism arrivals and expenditure have not been compiled since end-2001.
Limited data are available on labor market developments.
B. Public Finances
Data on revenue, expenditure, and financing of the consolidated central government are made
available to Fund staff on request. Commendable progress has recently been made in
improving the quality and coverage of central government fiscal data, including on
government and public enterprise debt. However, discrepancies between overall balance and
available financing need to be resolved. It would be important to produce a set of fully
integrated accounts for the central government on a regular basis. Also, it would be beneficial
to institute a mechanism for the regular reporting of financial data on the rest of the public
sector. The most recent data on the central government published in the GFS Yearbook are
for 2003 and 2006.
C. Balance of Payments and External Debt
Estimates are currently provided on an annual basis by the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank
(ECCB). The latest data published in IFS are for 2007. Incomplete provisional data have
been produced for 2008 by the ECCB; these will be completed and finalized in early 2009.
Data on external trade (especially exports) are not comprehensive, as they omit important
categories of goods. Most components of the financial account also need improvement. It
would be useful to reconcile the data on the public sector investment plan for external loans
with the public external debt database. There are no data on private external debt.

11
D. Monetary and Financial Statistics
The 2003 money and banking statistics mission indicated that enhanced institutional
coverage, classification of financial instruments, and sectorization of economic units would
facilitate identification of credit flows to different sectors of the economy and compilation of
monetary aggregates. It recommended that the institutional coverage for other depository
corporations be expanded to include credit unions, finance companies, and building societies,
which also accept demand and other deposits. Further, the mission recommended broadening
the coverage to include insurance companies, pension funds, development banks, and
offshore institutions and foundations.
In April 2007, a data ROSC mission assessed the monetary statistics with reference to the
GDDS and the Data Quality Assessment Framework (DQAF, July 2003). It indicated that the
quality of the ECCB and Eastern Caribbean Currency Union member countries’ monetary
statistics has improved over recent years, and the monetary statistics are broadly adequate for
macroeconomic analysis and policy design and monitoring. Nevertheless, the mission
identified shortcomings that have the potential for detracting from accurate and timely
analysis of economic and financial developments. In particular, the institutional coverage of
the other depository corporations remains incomplete, as data for mortgage companies,
finance companies, building societies, and credit unions—all of which accept deposits—are
excluded. Also, accrued interest is not incorporated in the value of the interest-bearing assets
and liabilities, and valuation adjustments are included in other liabilities. In addition, source
data for the commercial banks do not provide the disaggregation recommended in the
Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual. The authorities endorsed the mission’s
recommendations and an action plan for enhancing the analytical usefulness of the monetary
statistics. In this context, with effect from January 1, 2009, the definition of broad money
aggregates is revised to include the deposits of non-bank financial institutions and
subsidiaries and affiliates held at commercial banks, and this change is first reflected in the
monetary statistics from January 2009.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2009 Article IV Consultation
with St. Kitts and Nevis
On May 15, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with St. Kitts and Nevis.1
Background
Near-term growth prospects have deteriorated markedly in the wake of the global recession, the
collapse of Trinidad-based CL Financial Group, and damage from Hurricane Omar, further
complicating an already difficult situation. The island of Nevis, in particular, has been badly
affected by Hurricane Omar which passed the region in October 2008, with the island’s largest
hotel likely to remain closed during 2009 due to damage from the hurricane’s storm surge.
Thus, after growing by 3.2 percent in 2008, St. Kitts and Nevis’ real output is projected to
contract by 1.2 percent in 2009. Risks to the outlook are clearly on the downside, as strains
from the global crisis have become increasingly evident in the local financial system, including
through extensive cross-border linkages with the troubled CL Financial Group.
Higher food and fuel prices led to a pick-up in inflation in the first ten months of 2008, peaking in
October 2008 at 8.3 percent before moderating to 7.6 percent at end-2008. Inflation is projected
to ease further in 2009 on the back of lower oil prices.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
The government’s commitment to debt reduction resulted in a fiscal primary surplus in 2008—at
more than 5 percent of GDP—for the fourth consecutive year, helping to lower the public debt
ratio (as a percent of GDP) by 20 percentage points over the past four years. However, the
primary surplus is projected to decline to 2½ percent of GDP in 2009, largely due to an
expected drop in revenues without concomitant cuts in expenditures, and the debt ratio is
expected to trend up again.
With a debt ratio at more than 175 percent of GDP by end-2008, debt service comprises nearly
a quarter of government revenues, leaving no space for fiscal policy to respond to the adverse
shocks. Fiscal consolidation will be important not only for restoring debt sustainability, but also
for supporting competitiveness, maintaining stability, and underpinning the Eastern Caribbean
Currency Union (ECCU) quasi-currency board arrangement.
Financial sector vulnerability stems from banks’ continued high government exposure and a
needed further strengthening of supervision of the nonbank sector. Moreover, should the global
slowdown be prolonged, the adverse impact could spread to the banking sector through a rise
in nonperforming loans. The insurance sector, meanwhile, is grappling with the fallout of
CL Financial Group’s problems.
The authorities have made a request for an Emergency Natural Disaster Assistance (ENDA)
purchase equivalent to 25 percent of quota (SDR 2.225 million). Although Hurricane Omar
struck in October 2008, the full impact due to the indefinite closure of a major tourism resort on
Nevis, has been slow to evolve. The authorities are attempting to address the effects of the
hurricane, but face severe financing constraints. Fund financing is expected to partly offset the
balance-of-payments impact, estimated at 3½ percent of GDP due largely to a decline in
tourism receipts.
Executive Board Assessment
The Executive Directors noted that, on the heels of several years of robust growth, the economy
of St. Kitts and Nevis has weakened markedly in the wake of the shocks from the global
recession, the collapse of the Trinidad and Tobago-based CL Financial Group, and the
devastating impact of Hurricane Omar. Directors concurred that, while the global downturn and
heavy debt burden are likely to weigh heavily on near-term growth, the economy is well placed
to achieve strong growth over the medium term provided that the authorities continue to
implement appropriate policies and press ahead with the reform agenda.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to restore fiscal and debt sustainability, as
evidenced by the achievement of four consecutive years of large primary surpluses, contributing
to a substantial lowering of the public debt ratio. Given the continued large financing needs,
Directors encouraged the authorities to push ahead with their goal of achieving even larger
primary surpluses over the medium term. They underscored the need for strengthened
expenditure control, together with further structural fiscal reforms including, most critically, the
implementation of the VAT. Directors also encouraged the authorities to tighten oversight of the
broader public sector; work closely with donors to tap additional grants or highly concessional

3
loans; accelerate land and/or other asset sales to lower debt more rapidly; and strengthen debt
management capacity.
Directors underscored the importance of fiscal consolidation in supporting competitiveness and
underpinning the ECCU’s quasi-currency board arrangement. Although the real effective
exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals, they noted that maintaining competitiveness
in the context of relatively high wage levels and a highly competitive tourism market will require
sustained efforts to improve the business climate and labor market.
Directors stressed the need to enhance monitoring and supervision of both the bank and
nonbank financial sectors, given the much less benign global environment, the heavy exposure
of the domestic banking system to the government, and the recent shocks to the insurance and
offshore financial sectors. They welcomed the plans to put in place an effective single regulatory
unit for the nonbank financial sector. Directors also commended the authorities’ efforts to
coordinate with other regional governments to address the regional financial turmoil resulting
from the fallout of the collapse of the CL Financial Group.
Directors generally agreed that the Fund’s emergency assistance for natural disasters will
provide valuable support in assisting the authorities with their efforts to mitigate Hurricane
Omar’s severe effects on the economy and the balance of payments. While noting the country’s
large public debt and inherent vulnerability, Directors were encouraged by the authorities’
exemplary record of debt service on external obligations and their resolve to sustain fiscal
consolidation, foster private sector-led growth, and work closely with the Fund in pursuing their
reform strategy. In this context, some Directors felt that the Stand-By Arrangement might be a
more appropriate instrument.
Directors encouraged the authorities to develop a full-fledged contingency and crisis
preparedness plan, including the identification of emergency fiscal measures. This would allow
the government to respond quickly to possible adverse scenarios that may arise against the
present background of the difficult financial climate and the country’s high vulnerability to
exogenous shocks.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program

IMF Executive Board Approves US$3.4 Million in Emergency Natural Disaster
Assistance for St. Kitts and Nevis
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund today approved a request for SDR
2.225 million (about US$3.4 million) in Emergency Natural Disaster Assistance for St. Kitts
and Nevis.
St. Kitts and Nevis was hit by Hurricane Omar in October 2008. The damage caused by the
hurricane has greatly aggravated the economic slowdown, with a significant impact on
unemployment, fiscal revenues, and tourism receipts, particularly on the island of Nevis.
Fund financing will help offset the balance of payments impact of the hurricane, estimated at
US$19 million (about 3½ percent of GDP).
The IMF provides emergency assistance to help member countries with urgent balance of
payments financing needs in the wake of natural disasters or armed conflicts. See Factsheet
about the Emergency Natural Disaster Assistance.
Following the Executive Board discussion, Mr. Murilo Portugal, Deputy Managing Director
and Acting Chair, issued the following statement:
“The damage caused by Hurricane Omar has resulted in substantial loss of employment and
great hardship to St. Kitts and Nevis. In particular, Nevis has suffered the temporary closure
of its largest tourism resort. The adverse balance of payments impact of the hurricane has
been compounded by the global recession and the collapse of the Trinidad and Tobago-based
CL Financial Group.
“The authorities are responding with a comprehensive economic program to deal with the
effects of the natural disaster within the context of the difficult economic situation facing the
country. They aim at strengthening public finances to reduce public debt ratios, while
undertaking structural reforms. These efforts will be supported by Fund emergency
assistance for natural disasters.

“The government, with the assistance of its development partners, is developing a growth
and poverty reduction strategy to guide its medium-term reform agenda. In addition to
strengthening fiscal policies and debt management, the main priorities for reform are
enhancing the investment climate for private sector development, including through
privatization and sale of public land and assets, and strengthening oversight of the financial
sector.
“While the global downturn and the heavy debt burden of St. Kitts and Nevis are likely to
weigh heavily on near-term growth, the authorities’ implementation of prudent policies and
their reform agenda, together with support from the international community, should help
St. Kitts and Nevis recover from the setbacks caused by the hurricane and place the economy on a
path of sustainable, strong growth,” Mr. Portugal stated.

Statement by Michael Horgan, Executive Director for St. Kitts and Nevis,
and Glenn Purves, Senior Advisor
May 15, 2009
The authorities of St. Kitts and Nevis (SKN) thank the staff for a constructive set of meetings
and a well-focused report that succinctly highlights the challenges facing the country,
especially during this turbulent period for world financial markets and the global economy.
The authorities also appreciate the efforts the staff has made in facilitating their request for
Emergency Natural Disaster Assistance (ENDA).
Most of the central issues facing SKN are common to the other small Caribbean islands, and
have already been well-articulated in the ECCU surveillance paper and Buff. SKN is a
unique federation with a population of only 45,000 spread across two islands. As a result, the
federation faces an inherent problem of very small size and consequent high overhead costs
of administration and provision of public services. Compounding this fiscal challenge is a
high level of public debt which stands, in large part, as a legacy of the long decline of the
sugar industry (which was closed in 2005). As the government owns most of the useable land
on St. Kitts and Nevis, the state sugar company incurred very large debts over many years by
borrowing against the security of the land holdings. Naturally, the costs associated with
hurricanes and other weather-related disasters also contributed to this burden.
The closure of the sugar company marked a necessary step for SKN in realigning its fiscal
position, and since 2005 the authorities have been running large primary surpluses, allowing
for the public debt ratio to decline by 20 percent. Nevertheless, a key challenge for SKN
continues to be divesting itself of the land holdings in a manner that results in a very
substantial reduction in the debt ratio. The turbulent global financial and economic
environment has presented many challenges in this regard.
Economic Performance
Even with the closure of the sugar industry, SKN has posted favorable economic growth over
the past five years, with real GDP growth estimated to have reached 3.2 percent in 2008. Yet
despite the authorities continuing to receive firm commitments to further major tourism
projects, the combined impact of the global downturn and impact of Hurricane Omar on
Nevis’s largest tourism resort is expected to take full effect in 2009, adversely impacting
tourism and construction via slower FDI inflows. As a result, the GDP of SKN is expected to
contract by 1.2 percent in 2009.
The Caribbean islands in the ECCU have traditionally enjoyed relatively low inflation.
However, spikes in commodity and food prices, and fluctuations in the strength of the dollar
(transmitted via the peg) has created some recent volatility. As a result, inflation stood at
7.6 percent at the end of 2008, and while this has been a source of concern for authorities in

2
the past, there is less concern looking ahead given that lower oil prices have yet to be
factored in. It should also be noted that for an economy such as SKN, a sizeable current
account deficit (roughly 30 percent of GDP in 2008) is mostly financed by FDI-related
investments in the tourism sector, and should not be mistaken for a
competitiveness/exchange rate issue.
Fiscal Policy
The sizable public debt in SKN has been a driving force in guiding the authorities’ prudent
fiscal policy, including the generation of primary surpluses since 2005. Given the challenging
environment ahead, the staff has clearly articulated two distinct paths and corresponding
outlooks for SKN’s authorities to pursue - a baseline scenario and an active scenario. At the
outset, the authorities wish to convey their commitment to taking an active role and adopting
bold adjustment policies for restoring fiscal and debt sustainability, and mitigating
vulnerabilities. They are examining the specific suggestions outlined by the staff in this
regard.
A testament of their commitment has been their proven track record, including decisive
actions to close the state sugar company, strengthen tax administration, the introduction of an
electricity surcharge, and the implementation of an automatic pass-through of fuel prices.
The implementation of the market-based property tax regime is ongoing. To date, over
60 percent of the residential properties have been valued at market and the authorities are
currently working on valuing commercial properties. In addition, they acknowledge that
further expenditure restraint is essential and are pushing forward with comprehensive civil
service reform to contain the wage bill and pension costs. They are also planning to introduce
a new Investment Code and Corporate Tax Act, which taken together will help limit
discretionary concessions.
The planned introduction of a VAT has been complicated by the existence of separate tax
administrations on the two islands. Nevertheless, the authorities are aware that the existence
of two VAT systems would be costly, complicated and lend themselves to leakages. Every
effort is being made to design one VAT system that can fit into the constitutional and
political environment. As the staff report highlights, progress has been made in terms of
forming a VAT team, with representation from both islands, and discussions on a revenuesharing agreement remain ongoing.
Public Debt Management and Reduction
On public debt management, the authorities of SKN are actively pursuing a combination of
stricter guidelines and policies on borrowing and provision of debt guarantees through a new
Financial Administration Act. This is in addition to efforts being taken to enhance the debt
management capacity of SKN, including seeking ways to reduce their dependence on high

3
cost, short-term bank financing. These are fundamental pillars for achieving medium-term
debt sustainability. To date, concessional resources have greatly assisted SKN, and the
authorities have met the conditions for the first tranche of the Caribbean Development
Bank’s (CDB) Policy-Based Loan and the release of the first in a series of EU sugar grants.
They look forward to continuing their engagement with the CDB, the EU and other
developmental partners for the remainder of the program.
Despite the efforts above, the authorities are also aware that a reduction of debt stock is
essential, and that meaningful debt reduction must come via a comprehensive and effective
sale of substantial amounts of the government’s land holdings. The staff report rightly notes
that there is broad agreement on aiming for land sales to the private sector at about 3 percent
of GDP per year, with proceeds being used to pay down the highest interest-bearing debt
first. However, this complex undertaking, both politically and technically, requires careful
planning and execution, and difficulties have only been compounded by the weakened state
of the global economy. Nevertheless, the authorities recognize that pursuing a strategy of
putting into place a transparent, market-based procedure for the sale of land must proceed,
but must occur over a considerable period of time.
Financial Sector Matters
The staff has expressed concerns about the high level of exposure of domestic banks to the
government, and as part of their strategy for addressing the public debt, the authorities are
aiming to reduce this exposure over time. The authorities have noted the staff’s suggestion to
borrow directly, albeit temporarily, from the social security system (eliminating the
intermediary role of the indigenous private bank), and will be factoring this into their
consideration. It should also be noted that the SKN authorities just passed a new Insurance
Law, strengthening their regulation over the insurance sector.
On challenges pertaining to the non-bank sector, notably the offshore sector of SKN, the
authorities continue to work constructively with the Caribbean Financial Action Task Force
(CFATF) and are looking to resolve, expeditiously, any remaining issues highlighted in its
most recent evaluation. This is an important sector for SKN, and as such the authorities
continue to harbour concerns about the risk that global measures taken against noncooperative jurisdictions, including tax havens, could have unintended negative impacts on
well-regulated, transparent, financial centers. As a principle, countries that comply with
international standards should be protected from such measures, and the authorities of SKN
and the ECCU will continue to work constructively to ensure that the views of important
regional bodies such as the CFATF continue to be taken into consideration, internationally.

4
Concluding Comment and Request for ENDA Support
Overall, the authorities continue along their path of transforming the economy away from
sugar. Despite the tremendous accomplishments they have made to date, the authorities
recognize the inherent vulnerability of SKN to developments in the world economy and to
catastrophic risk, and are thus fully committed to policies, such as those articulated in the
“active scenario”, to enhance the flexibility and resilience of the economy.
To this end, the authorities wish to convey to the Board that a policy response paper has been
prepared for Cabinet, which proposes that the 2009 Budget be cut by EC$30 million (roughly
2 percent of SKN’s GDP). The paper reflects core principles for SKN, including: protection
of the most vulnerable; prevention of further deterioration of the fiscal situation; continuation
of downward trajectory with respect to debt; concentration on growth enhancing capital
projects; and exploring opportunities for development/improvements in the policy
framework. The process will involve re-examining short-term and long-term revenue and
expenditure measures, and contingency sources of financing.
Nevertheless, the authorities continue to grapple with the immediate impact of Hurricane
Omar last fall, which has resulted in the closure of the largest tourism resort, and
consequently the largest direct/indirect employer, in Nevis. As the authorities attempt to
address the impact of the hurricane, it is recognized that ENDA assistance would make an
important contribution to their efforts to contend with the transitory, but significant, balance
of payment impact resulting from lower tourism receipts - estimated at 3.5 percent of SKN’s
GDP. A favorable response by the Board to their request for 25 percent of their quota
(SDR 2.225 million) would be most appreciated.
