IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with Namibia
On December 2, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with Namibia.
Since the financial crisis, Namibia has experienced remarkable growth and economic progress.
Strong policy frameworks and expansionary domestic policies have contributed to
macroeconomic stability, robust growth, and rising living standards. Yet, deep-rooted structural
impediments have kept unemployment high and unresponsive to growth, contributing to
persistently high inequality.
In 2015, growth remained strong, but vulnerabilities increased. Despite a severe drought, real
GDP grew by 5.3 percent buoyed by construction in the mining and housing sectors, and
expansionary fiscal policy. However, with strong domestic demand and declining Southern
African Customs Union (SACU) revenue, the current account registered a double-digit deficit. In
combination, the large fiscal deficit, the depreciation of the Namibian dollar along with the South
African rand, to which it is pegged, and the issuance of a Eurobond in November 2015 increased
public debt to about 40 percent of GDP, close to the median of similarly-rated emerging
economies. At the same time, continued rapid credit growth contributed to fast growing
residential real estate prices and elevated household indebtedness. Headline inflation rose to 6.9
percent in September, from the 3.4 average in 2015, mostly due to rising food prices caused by
the drought.
Fiscal and monetary policies are on a tightening course. The government has revised the
FY16/17 budget and announced the intention to reduce the fiscal deficit in the coming years. In
the context of the peg with the South African rand, the Bank of Namibia raised its policy rate in
2015 and in 2016 to 7 percent, at par with the South African Reserve Bank’s rate.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2

The outlook remains positive with considerable vulnerabilities and risks. Growth is projected to
temporarily weaken in 2016 to 1.6 percent as the construction of large mines ends and the
government starts consolidating; it would then accelerate to about 5 percent in 2017–18 as
production from new mines ramps up. However, without further deficit reduction, public debt is
projected to increase above 60 percent by 2021. On the positive side, the current account deficit
is expected to narrow to around 5 percent of GDP on the back of larger mining exports. Inflation
is anticipated to decline to 6 percent by 2017 as food prices normalize.
Downside risks dominate the outlook and stem mainly from possible further declines in SACU
revenues and commodity prices, lower growth in mining and construction, and sudden
corrections in housing prices and domestic credit. With limited buffers, shocks could be
amplified by abrupt policy responses, especially if combined with sovereign credit rating
downgrades. Linkages between banks and non-bank financial institutions could further amplify
shocks.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed Namibia’s robust economic performance and rising living
standards in the past several years. Directors noted, however, that while medium-term growth
prospects remain positive, rising public debt, a widening current account deficit, low
international reserves, and further declines in commodity prices pose risks. They underscored
that continued strong commitment to sound policies and structural reforms will be key to
preserving macroeconomic stability, managing financial sector risks, and promoting job creation
and inclusive growth.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ debt and fiscal strategy, and agreed that additional
consolidation over the medium term will be necessary to put public debt on a declining path.
Noting the authorities’ preference for some front-loading, they emphasized that adjustment
efforts should be carefully calibrated and focus on both revenue and expenditure measures while
safeguarding priority capital and social spending, thus minimizing the impact on growth.
Directors noted that measures to contain the public wage bill, curtail transfers to state-owned
enterprises (SOEs) and other entities, as well as the strengthening of public financial
management and revenue administration would help facilitate the adjustment and ensure
equitable burden sharing. They also encouraged steps to reform SOEs to strengthen their
governance, oversight, and performance.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

Directors noted that fiscal consolidation would lift pressure on monetary policy and that, in the
context of the peg with the South African rand, the authorities should consider maintaining the
policy rate at par, or with limited positive spread, with the South African Reserve Bank’s rate.
Directors recognized that Namibia’s financial sector is generally stable, and called for continued
efforts to monitor and manage risks from rising housing prices, household indebtedness, and
linkages between banks and non-bank financial institutions. They commended the central bank
for introducing loan-to-value-limits for non-primary residence purchases, and recommended that
further targeted macro-prudential measures to tame housing price dynamics be explored.
Directors recognized that the tight linkages between banks and non-bank financial institutions
are macro critical and stressed the importance of monitoring and assessing possible financial
stability risks from such linkages. In this context, Directors encouraged steps to improve the
financial regulatory architecture and to enhance the central bank’s capacity to assess
macrofinancial risks and exercise macroprudential controls.
Directors emphasized that implementation of well-focused structural reforms is necessary to
address high unemployment and income inequality. They highlighted that priority should be
given to reducing skill mismatches through targeted education and training programs,
simplifying business regulations, including improving the functioning of the labor market.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to improve the targeting of key social assistance
programs, including cash transfers and housing subsidies to make further inroads in reducing
inequality and poverty.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
November 17, 2016

KEY ISSUES
Context. Namibia has experienced strong growth and economic stability, but faces
significant challenges and structural issues. Public debt is rising and reserve coverage is
below safe levels. Banks’ balance sheets appear robust, but rising housing prices and
household indebtedness pose macro-financial concerns. Deep-rooted structural
problems have kept unemployment and income inequality unacceptably high.
Outlook, risks, and challenges. 2016 growth is projected at 1.6 percent, accelerating in
2017–18. Downside risks dominate the outlook and stem from possible fall in SACU
revenue, lower growth in mining and construction, and corrections in the housing and
credit markets. With limited buffers, shocks could be amplified by abrupt policy
responses, especially if combined with a sovereign credit rating downgrade.
Namibia’s key policy challenges are to preserve macroeconomic stability, manage
financial stability risks, and make inroads in reducing unemployment and inequality.
Fiscal and monetary policy. The 2016 budget introduced a tighter fiscal stance, but
additional adjustment is needed to preserve debt sustainability. Adjustment needs to
be carefully designed to reduce the impact on growth. It needs to be gradual and
combine both revenue and expenditure measures, while safeguarding capital and social
spending. Reforms of public financial management systems and the revenue
administration, and key interventions to improve SOEs performance would create space
for adjustment and ensure a more equitable burden sharing. To support the peg, the
policy rate should remain at par, or with a limited positive spread, with the SARB’s rate.
Financial stability. Risks from rising housing prices, household indebtedness, and
linkages between banks and NBFIs need to be monitored and managed. The
introduction of LTV limits for non-primary residence purchases is welcomed and could
be complement by DSTI limits. Improving the financial regulatory architecture is critical
to provide the BoN with the powers to assess macro-financial risks and exercise macroprudential controls.
Structural reforms. Targeted structural reforms could significantly increase job
creation and deliver more inclusive growth. Reforms to reduce skill mismatches and
simplify business regulations would have the highest impact on employment. Better
targeting of key social assistance programs could make further inroads in reducing
inequality and extreme poverty.

CONTEXT: ROBUST GROWTH WITH GROWING
VULNERABILITIES
1.
Since the financial crisis, Namibia has experienced robust growth and resilience to
shocks, but vulnerabilities have been building up while unemployment remains high. Despite
being a small commodity–dependent economy exposed to external shocks, since 2010, average
annual real GDP growth exceeded 5 percent. The

expansionary fiscal policy have led to a sharp

increase in public debt. The current account deficit

has widened, and the international reserve

coverage has declined below safe levels (Table 1).

Yet, unemployment remains high and little
responsive to growth, contributing to maintain high income inequality, second only to South Africa
(Figure 1).
2.

In 2015, growth remained strong, but external and fiscal vulnerabilities gained
prominence (Table 1).



Despite a severe drought, real GDP grew by 5.3 percent (6.5 percent in 2014) buoyed by
construction in the mining and housing sectors, and expansionary fiscal policy. Strong public
consumption and investment underpinned growth. Accommodative monetary conditions
contributed to further boost bank credit and domestic demand (Figure 2). The economy,
however, decelerated in the first half of 2016, with real GDP contracting in 2016Q2 as growth in
construction and government services slowed down.



Strong domestic demand and declining SACU transfers widened the current account deficit to
13.7 percent of GDP (7.6 percent in 2014). On the positive side, the 2015 Eurobond issuance
improved reserve coverage to 2.8 months of projected imports (Annex I). However, other
external buffers have thinned: external debt increased to about 51 percent of GDP (42¾ percent
in 2014); external gross financing needs rose to 31 percent of GDP, well above the average of
past years; and, the net international investment position, while still positive, declined to 4
percent of GDP from 15 percent in 2014 (Table 2; Figure 3). Moreover, since December 2015,
reserve coverage has fallen, to 2.2 months of imports (August 2016).1

Expansionary fiscal policy caused the fiscal deficit to widen to an estimated 10.2 percent of GDP
as subsidies and capital spending increased and SACU revenue declined (Table 3b).2 The large
deficit, combined with the issuance of the 2015

government started implementing spending reductions and announced medium-term fiscal
consolidation plans to bring public debt on a declining path.
5.
Acknowledging long-term challenges, the government elected in 2015 has devised
plans to boost growth and increase employment, while preserving macroeconomic stability. In
the context of their 2030 vision, authorities are articulating a new national development plan (NDP),
and implementing industrial policies to support labor-intensive sectors. However, the impact of
some past initiatives, including tax incentives, has been limited, particularly on job creation and
economic diversification, and a review is ongoing. At the same time, macroeconomic stability has
been maintained, with the latest economic policies broadly reflecting recent Fund’s advice.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
6.
The economy will slow down in 2016 and vulnerabilities are rising. As the construction
of large mines comes to an end and the government starts consolidating, real GDP growth is
foreseen to slow temporarily to 1.6 percent in 2016. Inflation is expected to decline to 6 percent only
by end-2017 as food prices normalize. Growth is projected to accelerate to above 5 percent in
2017-2018, as production from the new Husab uranium mine ramps up, before converging to a
long-term rate of about 4 percent. However, because of low SACU revenue over the medium-term,
future fiscal deficits are expected to remain large and public debt to increase to above 60 percent of
GDP by 2021. Financing the government would require significant shifts in asset allocations of
domestic financial institutions, possibly crowding out private sector credit. On the positive side,
larger mining exports and tighter domestic policies would halve the trade deficit to about
12⅓ percent of GDP, with the current account deficit stabilizing at around 5 percent of GDP. In this
context, SACU transfers and capital and financial flows will continue playing a key stabilizing role in
the Namibian economy and in financing future trade deficits (Annex I).3
7.
Risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside. The main external risks to the Namibian
economy arise from further commodity price declines as China rebalancing proceeds, accelerated
fall in SACU revenue as the South African economy continues to slow, and lower demand for exports
and domestic services as growth in the European trade partners and Angola remains sluggish.
Domestic risks are equally prominent and weigh heavily on the outlook, especially from slower
growth in the mining and construction sectors, sudden correction in overvalued housing prices and
domestic credit, and possible funding risks from the government’s large financing needs and slower
fiscal adjustment.
8.
The limited buffers could potentially force abrupt policy responses that would amplify
the adverse impact of shocks. Should risks materialize, exports and growth would decrease,
creating further pressure on fiscal and external accounts, and international reserves. Given the
limited buffers, shocks could prompt an abrupt fiscal adjustment that would exacerbate the negative
short-term impact on the economy, as the effects of appropriate fiscal and structural reforms would
3

Over the medium term, SACU revenues are projected to remain below their recent peak, and to decline as a share
of GDP, as Namibia’s nominal GDP growth is expected to exceed the growth rate of SACU revenues dominated by
low growth in South Africa.

take time to materialize (Annex II). The impact would be particularly damaging if accompanied by
downgrades of the sovereign credit rating, which could prompt further increases in interest rates for
both the public and private sector. In addition, sharp reversals in housing prices, coupled with
elevated household indebtedness, could negatively affect financial intermediation through a
deterioration in banks’ asset quality and profitability, and in turn growth.

Authorities’ views
9.
The authorities broadly agree with the outlook and staff’s risk assessment, but have a
more optimistic view on short-term growth prospects. They expect a milder slowdown in 2016
largely because of lower fiscal multiplier assumptions. However, they agree that near-term domestic
risks weigh heavily on the outlook, particularly risks from government’s large financing needs. They
concur that forced fiscal adjustment could amplify the negative effects of shocks on the economy.
To mitigate risks, they have revised the FY16/17 budget and brought forward their fiscal adjustment
plans.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Namibia’s key challenges are to preserve macroeconomic stability and make inroads in reducing high
unemployment and income inequality. With recent expansionary fiscal policy contributing to rising
public debt and external vulnerabilities, discussions focused on the need for: (i) anchoring additional
fiscal adjustment in a credible medium-term plan that minimizes the negative impact on growth;
(ii) managing risks from overvalued housing prices and the large non-bank financial sector; and
(iii) advancing structural reforms to generate sufficient jobs to reduce unemployment and inequality.

A. Designing Fiscal Consolidation
10.
The authorities’ 2016 budget and medium-term fiscal strategy marked a departure
from past policies, outlining significant fiscal adjustment to bring public debt below their
target of 35 percent of GDP. The budget envisaged nominal reductions in recurrent expenses—
particularly goods and services and transfers to SOEs—and the postponement of non-productive
capital outlays to yield a deficit 4.7 percent of GDP. The medium-term strategy foresaw negative
growth in real primary expenses and contained capital spending dynamics to reduce the deficit to
2.1 percent of GDP and the public debt ratio to about 28 percent of GDP by FY18/19. However, the
extent and quality of measures underpinning medium-term spending reductions remained to be
identified. In the October mid-year budget review, the authorities introduced further spending
reductions of about 2.8 percent of GDP for the remainder of FY16/17 to partially offset lower than
excepted revenue, and revised the deficit to 6.3 percent of GDP, with a pro-cyclical stance.
Reductions included a freeze on new hiring, and cuts to not yet executed capital and non-wage
recurrent expenditure. The authorities also recognized that achieving their medium-term fiscal
targets requires additional fiscal adjustment, and announced the intention to strengthen their
adjustment plans going forward.

Under staff’s baseline scenario, which includes budget spending plans, fiscal deficits
would remain large and public debt continue rising. The revised FY16/17 budget projects higher
revenue than staff. As a result, staff foresees the

1/ Fiscal data refer to fiscal year. Projections reflect revised FY16/17 budget.

12.
Additional fiscal adjustment is needed to bring public debt on a declining path and
preserve macro-economic stability. Fiscal adjustment should be anchored in a credible
medium-term framework and carefully calibrated to limit negative effects on growth.

4

Crowing out of domestic credit could occur as domestic banks increase their holdings of government securities to
finance the fiscal deficit. Under this assumption, satisfying the remainder of government’s gross financing needs in
FY16/17-18/19 would still require non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) to increase their holdings of government
securities from 14 percent of GDP in 2015 to about 23 percent in 2018.
5

Risks include: weaker growth, lower commodity prices, slower fiscal adjustment, materialization of contingent
liabilities, particularly for SOEs, and higher borrowing costs.
8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NAMIBIA



Under staff’s macroeconomic assumptions, a further 4½-5½ percent of GDP in measures
(depending on multipliers) would likely be required over FY17/18-19/20 to bring the public debt
ratio on a declining path by FY19/20 and eventually below 35 percent of GDP, as envisaged by
the authorities. Spreading the additional adjustment over three years would limit the negative
impact on growth and concentrate the adjustment at a time when growth is projected to be
above its long-term trend. The adjustment would bring additional benefits. It would support
further external adjustment and result in safer levels of reserve coverage (Annex I). It would also
contain government’s gross financing needs, reducing crowding out and funding risks, although
lower growth could temporarily reduce banks’ profitability and asset quality. In addition, fiscal
adjustment would lift pressures on monetary policy. In this context, the BoN should maintain the
policy rate at par, or with limited positive spread, with the SARB’s rate to support the peg.
Bringing public debt below 35 percent of GDP by FY19/10, as planned by the authorities, would
improve the fiscal outlook, but put significant downward pressure on short-term growth.

Staff recommends the additional adjustment to be based on quality measures with low shortterm multipliers to limit the negative impact on growth. A combination of increases in indirect
revenue (e.g., ¼ of the adjustment) and expense reductions, while protecting capital and social
spending, would minimize the impact of fiscal adjustment.6 While ambitious, the adjustment
appears feasible if credibly designed. Staff proposed a menu of measures to be considered by

Fiscal adjustment should be accompanied by structural reforms in public financial
management and revenue administration. Improved spending efficiency and better revenue
collection are critical to create space for adjustment, minimize the adverse growth impact of the
consolidation, and ensure equitable burden sharing. Reforms should focus on:


10

Public financial management (PFM). An early enactment of the 2015 Public Procurement Act
(scheduled for FY2017/18), and stronger procurement processes could reduce waste and free
resources for consolidation. Strengthening the macro-fiscal forecasting capacity at the ministry
of finance, and accelerating plans to reform budget formulation and execution processes and
the PFM legal framework could enhance the preparation and implementation of consolidation
plans. Improving public investment management (e.g., project appraisal, implementation) would
help support more efficient growth-enhancing spending. Finally, as the authorities plan to boost
their efforts for public-private partnerships (PPP), a well-designed legal framework is needed to
avoid excessive risk taking.
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NAMIBIA



Revenue administration. A recent international assessment has signaled significant room for
improvement in the organization structure, business processes, and human resource
management of the revenue administration. The authorities’ plans to create a semi-autonomous
revenue authority possibly by 2017 are, therefore, timely and welcomed. Nonetheless, while
gains from improving revenue administration in Namibia are potentially large, cross-country
experience suggests that reaping the benefits of such changes may take time. To bring forward
some of the benefits of better revenue administration, staff recommends to continue prioritizing
the collection of tax arrears, and enhancing internal business process and IT systems.

14.
Concrete steps to reform the SOEs are needed to lower budgetary costs and improve
confidence and growth. With a few exceptions, most SOEs operate at a loss and represent a
significant burden for public finances and a source of fiscal risks. At the same time, they operate in
key service and network industries and are critical to service delivery and infrastructure development
(Box 1). The authorities are aware that SOEs face a number of financial and governance challenges
and have recently created a Ministry of Public Enterprises as a step toward strengthening the
monitoring of the sector and enhancing its performance. Reforms should focus on key areas,
including: (i) stronger and timely oversight of the financial performance of key SOEs; (ii) full
implementation of the legally mandated governance framework (e.g., business plans, performance
agreements, and reporting obligations); and (iii) a clear demarcation between commercial,
developmental and social activities to strengthen accountability, and foster greater private
participation.

Authorities’ views
15.
The authorities concur that changes in the macroeconomic outlook have significantly
worsened the fiscal position. They noticed that in addition to a shortfall in revenues, which
widened the deficit, the sharp increase in the public debt ratio in 2015 was due to the depreciation
of the currency, a low GDP deflator, and the Eurobond issuance, which was partly saved. They are
cognizant that current policies, if not recalibrated, would keep public debt on a rising path,
threatening hard-won macro-economic stability. Therefore, they have introduced significant
spending reductions in the revised FY16/17 budget, and plan to strengthen their fiscal consolidation
strategy going forward.
16.
They affirmed their commitment to undertake additional fiscal adjustment to bring
public debt on a declining path. They concur that significant adjustment is needed to bring the
public debt ratio below 35 percent of GDP. They noticed that the adjustment could be phased over
time, but have a preference for some frontloading to ease funding pressures and bring public debt
below 35 percent over the next three years. They also noticed that fiscal adjustment should be
based on quality measures with low multipliers to contain the negative impact of consolidation on
growth, while protecting social spending. In this respect, they intend to focus on measures with the
least adverse impact on economic activity, such as inefficient current spending and capital outlays
that do not directly enter into productive processes.

Box 1. State Owned Enterprises in Namibia
Namibia’s State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) play an important role in key sectors of the economy.
There are about 30 SOEs and 3 stated owned financial institutions.1/ Most of the large SOEs operate in
key service and network industries, and often in monopoly positions, such as telecommunications
(Telecom Namibia), electricity (NamPower), water (NamWater), and transportation (Air Namibia).
Because of their position, they play a key role in service delivery and in carrying out the government’s
infrastructure development plans, funded through budget transfers often complemented by direct
borrowing guaranteed by the government. In addition, SOEs engage in other quasi-fiscal activities,
such as pricing services below cost or market price (e.g., water supply in rural areas).
The financial performance of the largest
SOEs is generally poor. With a few
exceptions (e.g., NamPower, NamPort), they
operate at a loss and have high leverage
ratios (e.g., Air Namibia, TransNamib, Road
Contractor Company) that make them
particularly vulnerable to interest rate
shocks. In several cases, SOEs stay solvent
only because of government transfers and
bailouts (e.g., Air Namibia).

are also a source of significant fiscal risks as their debt (about 4.3 percent of GDP in 2015) is largely
guaranteed by the government The authorities expect the stock of guaranteed debt to increase further
in the future as SOEs execute new development projects.
The authorities are aware that SOEs face a number of financial and governance challenges that
require overhauling reforms. In addition to their poor financial position, compliance with reporting
requirements is weak, with most of the SOEs not publishing regular annual reports or financial
statements. Furthermore, information on the aggregate performance of the sector is not available.
Moreover, governance remains poor and compliance with national legislation (e.g., appointment of
management, remuneration, and audits) is weak.3/ Recognizing the role of SOEs and their problems,
the authorities have started spearheading various initiatives. In 2015, they created the Ministry of
Public Enterprises with the mandate to oversee the functions and responsibilities of 98 parastatals,
including SOEs, and reform the sector; and, in 2016, they set up a centralized reporting framework with
key SOEs responding to the new ministry.

In authorities’ views, a combination of revenue and spending measures, and structural
reforms, including for SOEs, would help to contain the negative effects of consolidation. They
concur that some taxes could be raised (e.g., excises) and expenditure reduced, particularly the wage
bill. They noticed that the degree of spending cuts could be mitigated by exploring the scope for
public-private partnerships (PPP), particularly in the outer years, and by further improving revenue
administration. To this end, they expect to finalize new PPP legislation by end-2016 and introduce a
semi-autonomous revenue agency. They also pointed out that improving and fully implementing
the existing Public Enterprises Governance Act and the new centralized reporting framework could
improve public companies’ performance and help rationalize public transfers.

B. Managing Systemic Risks in the Financial Sector
18.
Namibia has a large and stable financial sector dominated by non-bank financial
institutions (NBFIs). The banking system (assets about 68 percent of GDP) appears well capitalized
and profitable. Credit quality is high with low NPLs, and liquidity above regulatory requirements
(Table 5). Against a sound banking system, growth in bank loans has been in the double digits for
longer than a decade, contributing to increased household indebtedness and buoyant housing
prices. At the same time, Namibia has large NBFIs (gross assets of about 260 percent of GDP) with
average solvency level in 2015 exceeding statutory requirements. However, financial and ownership
interconnections between banks and NBFIs and foreign linkages make Namibia’s financial sector
rather complex, complicating the assessment of capital and liquidity adequacy of individual
institutions. In addition, the financial sector plays an important role in government financing,
holding half of government debt (Figure 4). Financial inclusion indicators have lately improved and
are close to some comparator countries (Figure 5).
19.
As the financial system expands and private indebtedness remains high, specific
financial risks with potentially large effects on the economy have gained prominence
(Figure 6). The main sources of possible systemic risks are:


Overvalued residential real estate prices and banks’ mortgage exposure. Exuberant growth in

mortgages being more than half of banks’ loans) Namibia. Residential Housing Price Overvaluation

Linkages between NBFIs and banks. Money and asset management funds (investment funds) are
tightly linked to banks. They provide about half of banks’ funding, and are often part of the
same financial conglomerate, creating complex ownership structures. At the same time,
investment funds are twice as large as banks and, as of end-2015, had about 60 percent of GDP
in assets invested in foreign equity markets, possibly exposing them to external shocks
(Figure 6). Balance sheet analysis suggests that a limited redemption shock to investment funds
(of less than 3 percent of their assets caused, for example, by an external or confidence shock),
that forces reallocations in funds’ assets away from bank deposits, could potentially lead to
severe liquidity shortages for banks, affecting credit availability and potentially leading to a
decline in growth.11

risk scenario entails overcorrection in housing prices, significant interest rate increases, and a severe recession. Stress
tests assume no use of profits, which could be used to absorb part of the losses and reduce the need for
deleveraging. For details, see Annex IV.

Past analysis suggests that a 1 percent negative change in real credit is associated with 0.47 percent decline in real
GDP in the long run (Country Report No. 15/276).

The estimated household balance sheets are obtained by combining household survey information with a large
sample of individual mortgage loans.
10

However, given that more than 50 percent of banks’ total mortgage portfolio is concentrated with
households in the top income quintile, an asymmetric shock affecting the specific sources of income of these
households could have larger effects (Box 2).
11

In addition, shocks to investment funds could reduce their ability to finance the government. However, in absence
of well-developed secondary markets, the effect would mainly be on new issuances and possibly in terms of higher
interest cost or financing shortages for the government. Based on Selected Issues Paper on “Macro-Financial Risks
from Linkages Between Banks and Non-Bank Financial Institutions.”

Box 2. Household Vulnerability1
Several years of sustained growth in mortgage lending has led to indebted households. Household
debt reached about 90 percent of disposable income in 2015, higher than in South Africa and close to the
levels of advanced economies. The high indebtedness is largely explained by sizable mortgage loans,
which in 2015 constituted about 85 percent of bank credit to households. Moreover, household survey
data suggest that the average debt to income ratio is significantly higher for high-income households.

Sustained income growth and low interest rates
have supported households’ repayment capacity.
Over 2010-13, growth in real disposable income in
Namibia averaged about 8 percent, well above the
level of OECD countries with available data. Strong
income growth has contributed to maintain
residential mortgage impairment figures broadly
stable, notwithstanding a high debt service burden
compared to BIS reporting countries, respectively
21 percent and 10 percent. A significant part of the
debt burden is due to large interest payments that
average about 11¾ percent of outstanding mortgage
loans, despite historically low interest rates.

Sources: BoN and OECD

Households are vulnerable to income and interest rate shocks, but banks appear resilient to such
shocks. Due to the absence of borrowers’ information, staff assessed the vulnerability of individual
household groups by estimating households’ balance sheets. The estimates combine data from the most
recent household survey (2009/10) with a large sample of individual mortgage loans. The estimated
balance sheets were then used to perform stress testing and assess the vulnerability of individual
household groups. The tests simulate an increase in interest rates of 200bps or 300bps under different
assumptions on real income growth rates. Shocks are assumed to be identical across income deciles.2
Results show that, under the 300bp interest rate shock, the share of vulnerable households could rise
between 4¼ (in the case of no real growth in gross income) to 10⅓ percent (with a 3 percent decline in
real gross income). Middle and upper-middle deciles of the income distribution appear to be the most
vulnerable to shocks. The impact on lower income households is smaller as they have lower debt levels and
are dependent on subsidies and transfers excluded from the income definition. Despite their higher
indebtedness, the impact on higher income households is also limited because of their large buffers. Under
these shocks, banks’ arrears on mortgages would increase by 4-5 times up to 9 percent of total loans, but
could still be absorbed by banks’ capital buffers.
Asymmetric shocks to the income sources of high income households could have larger effect on
banks. Since almost 55 percent of total mortgages are accounted by the top two deciles of the household
income distribution, a shock to their sources of income could have significant effects. For instance,
lowering the nominal income of these households by 15 percent, combined with a 300bp increase in
interest rates, could increase mortgage arrears up to 20-21 percent. Under this scenario, the system would
on average be resilient, but some banks could face difficulties in complying with capital requirements.

20.
A number of measures would strengthen the authorities’ ability to manage the
different sources of systemic risk arising from the financial sector:12


Introducing further macroprudential measures to curb risks from the housing market,
including debt-service-to income ratio (DSTI) limits. While structural distortions in the real
estate market should be addressed directly, macroprudential policies can help mitigate the risks
from overvalued housing prices. To tame these risks, the authorities have recently introduced
loan-to-value (LTV) limits for non-primary home purchases to be effective in 2017. These could
be complemented by DSTI limits, which would rely on recent reforms of credit information
systems.13 DSTI limits would help address the tendency of LTV limits to become less binding as
property prices increase and curb already high households’ debt service to income ratios. At the
same time, it is important to extend the limits to non-bank financial institutions engaged in the
real estate business to avoid regulatory leakages. In addition, as risks to the banking sector may
arise from primary residential mortgages, authorities could, at a later stage, consider introducing
LTV limits on such mortgages. These limits should be carefully designed and timed to avoid
hampering affordability for lower income groups and sudden price corrections.



Strengthening the supervision of NBFIs. Over the past years, NAMFISA has been
strengthening its capacity to supervise and regulate NBFIs. However, the Financial and
Institutions Market (FIM) Bill needs to be approved and enacted to create a modern and
adequate regulatory and supervisory framework. In addition, NAMFISA could take further steps
toward risk-based supervision of systemic NBFIs.



Monitoring and assessing financial stability risks from banks and NBFIs linkages.
Investment funds and their linkages with banks are macro critical and warrant closer scrutiny.
The BoN is the best placed institution to take the lead in assessing financial stability risks arising
from such linkages and conduct stress tests on banks considering possible shocks to and from
investment funds. Better knowledge of inter-group linkages could also deepen the
understanding of risks arising within financial conglomerates. In general, the authorities should
accelerate their plans to improve the financial regulatory architecture and provide the BoN with
the powers and instruments to assess macro-financial risks and exercise macro-prudential
controls for the whole financial sector. In addition, they should step up efforts to introduce
consolidated supervision to account for complex ownership and financial linkages across
institutions in assessing risks, and to prevent regulatory arbitrage of capital and liquidity
requirements.



Addressing information and data gaps. The authorities have made significant efforts to
improve data availability, although additional progress is needed. NAMFISA should continue to
improve the collection of granular data, and eventually develop financial sector indictors (FSIs)
for NBFIs and adequate databases to move towards risk-based supervision. The BoN could
accelerate its efforts to improve the existing housing price indices. It should also develop wealth

and debt household surveys (and/or collect borrower data from banks and credit bureaus) to
allow a better assessment of the risks stemming from the household sector, and fill data gaps to
better understand the linkages inside the financial system.

Authorities’ view
21.
The authorities concur with the assessment of financial risks and are taking steps to
address key vulnerabilities. They noticed that the implementation of the new LTV limits and the
recently enacted regulations on minimum down-payments for instalment credit (2016 Credit
Amendment Act) would curb credit growth and risks from the housing market. Based on the
experience in other countries, the BoN will explore options to introduce DSTI limits at a later stage.
However, the authorities noticed that introducing macroprudential limits on primary residences is
not desirable at this stage in light of structural housing shortages and potential social implications.
22.
They are cognizant of potential risks from banks and NBFIs linkages. The authorities
noted that a shock to investment funds might not necessarily drain the liquidity in the system if, for
example, deposits are re-directed from investment funds to banks, posing lower systemic risks than
staff analysis suggests. However, they recognized the importance of having a strong institutional
framework with a leading role for the BoN in assessing systemic risks arising from interconnections
within the financial system and in conducting macroprudential policy. To this effect, they have
finalized a Financial Stability Policy Framework. The framework will lead to the enactment of new
legislation expected to improve coordination across the institutions in charge of regulating and
supervising the financial system (BoN, NAMFISA and MoF). NAMFISA concurred with the need to
enhance its regulatory capacity, including with technical assistance from the IMF, and move towards
risk-based supervision. The authorities expect the approval of pending bills (particularly the
NAMFISA and FIM bills) will significantly strengthen the regulatory environment for NBFIs.

C. Lowering Unemployment and Reducing Inequality
23.
Structural impediments are limiting the impact of growth on unemployment,
especially among youth. Despite registering one of the highest average growth rates in Africa over
the past 20 years, unemployment, particularly among youth, remains high, suggesting that it is
structural. When compared to other countries, the elasticity of employment to growth appears
constrained, among others, by: (i) skills mismatches due to the lack of a well-educated labor force;
(ii) weaknesses in the business environment, including cumbersome regulations, and difficulties in
starting businesses and obtaining work permits; and, (iii) growth dynamics dominated by less laborintensive sectors. (Figures 7–8).
24.
The authorities’ reform agenda focuses on growth-enhancing policies to support
employment, but the impact of key policies has been limited and a review is undergoing. The
2011-13 Targeted Intervention Program for Employment and Economic Growth (TIPEEG) mainly led
to the creation of temporary jobs.14 The creation of tax-free export processing zones (EPZ) and
various tax incentive schemes have had only limited impact on export diversification and

NAMIBIA

employment. More recently, the authorities have started a review of tax incentive schemes with the
objective, among others, to support the labor-intensive manufacturing sector. They have also begun
implementing their “Growth at Home” strategy to support industries considered instrumental for job
creation and domestic value-added. Moreover, they have enacted a new Investment Promotion Act
to promote entrepreneurship and foreign investment. Also, in an attempt to ameliorate skill
mismatches, in 2016 the government extended free education to secondary schooling and provided
additional funding for vocational training.
25.
A package of well-targeted reforms aimed to increase the elasticity of employment to
growth could significantly boost job creation and deliver more inclusive growth. Structural
reforms in two key areas could potentially have significant impact:15


Reduce skill mismatches. Reducing mismatches due to the lack of well-educated labor force is
the most promising way to increase the elasticity of employment to growth. This requires
improving access and quality of higher education, and providing incentives to transition to
tertiary education and vocational training.16 Moreover, improving the quality of primary and
junior secondary education and strengthening programs to acquire on-job training would
facilitate the transition to higher education and to the labor market.



Improve business conditions. Simplifying
business regulations (e.g., starting businesses,
registering property, buying industrial land) and
reviewing the functioning of the labor market
(e.g., reducing restrictions on work permits for
skilled workers, simplifying labor dispute
processes) have the potential to improve
employment elasticity. In addition, reforms in
these areas might boost labor-intensive SMEs,
and the manufacturing sector with positive
effects on employment.

Authorities’ view
27.
The authorities intend to continue addressing high unemployment, income inequality
and poverty with focused structural reforms and better targeting of social programs. They
have recently created the Ministry of Poverty Eradication and Social Welfare to focus policy efforts.
They also recognize that reducing skill mismatches and promoting a more attractive business
environment are priorities for development. The recent Harambee Prosperity Plan translates some of
these priorities into a set of specific actions. Moreover, the authorities argued that a number of
strategic industries such as agri-business, logistics, tourism and manufacturing need to be
supported to foster domestic value-added and job creation. A fifth NDP is under preparation to
coordinate government’s policies geared toward promoting growth and job creation. Finally, with
the assistance of development partners, the authorities have started reviewing key social programs
to improve their capacity to reduce income inequality and poverty.

While poverty in Namibia has declined, income
inequality remains one of the highest in the world,
second only to South Africa. From the early 1990s to
2009/10, the poverty headcount declined from
70 percent to 15 percent.2 However, income inequality
remains high with a Gini coefficient of 60.7 (in 2009/10,
latest year available), the second highest in the world,
largely reflecting legacies of unequal wealth distribution
from the pre-independence period. Reducing poverty
and inequality is, therefore a national priority and a
policy challenge for development.

Source: WDI

In Namibia, fiscal policy and, in particular, large social spending play a key role in reducing both
income inequality and poverty. In 2015, social spending was about 17 percent of GDP (40 percent of total
public spending), higher than in most middle-income
countries. It includes direct cash transfers (e.g., old age
pensions, children, disability, veteran’s grants), other subsidies
(e.g., housing, water), and large in-kind spending in education
and health. According to a World Bank’s forthcoming
incidence analysis, social programs such as cash transfers and
subsidies reduce inequality by about 10 percent and by
25 percent once combined with in-kind spending. At the
same time, cash transfers reduce extreme poverty by
8 percent, although taxes and other subsidies marginally
increase poverty.
The impact of social spending on income inequality could greatly improve through better targeting
and improved efficiency. Preliminary findings from the
World Bank’s equity study (forthcoming) suggest that
Progressivity of Direct Cash Transfers
targeting accuracy of direct cash transfers (i.e., the share of
total transfers going to the bottom quintile of the income
distribution) is poor, and the impact of such transfers on
inequality as measured by the Gini coefficient is much
lower than, for example, in South Africa. Water subsidies
appears better targeted, while housing subsidies have
room for improvement. Moreover, despite high public
spending in education, education outcomes are rather
poor. Against this background, reforming cash transfers
and housing subsidies by introducing proxy means testing
could strengthen their impact on inequality, without
additional budget strains. Moreover, improving the quality
of education and access to secondary and tertiary

education would help reap the benefits from high
education expenditures.

STAFF APPRAISAL
28.
Since the financial crisis, Namibia has experienced strong growth, but faces rising
vulnerabilities and high unemployment and income inequality. Strong policy frameworks,
expansionary domestic policies, and buoyant credit growth have contributed to macroeconomic
stability, robust growth, and rising living standards. However, vulnerabilities are building up. Public
debt is on a rising path, the current account deficit is in the double digits, and international reserve
coverage is below safe levels. At the same time, rapid credit growth contributed to fast-growing
residential real estate prices, and elevated household indebtedness. In addition, deep-rooted
structural impediments have kept unemployment high and unresponsive to growth, contributing to
persistently high income inequality.
29.
Namibia faces significant policy challenges, while risks to the outlook are tilted to the
downside. Growth is projected to weaken in 2016, and accelerate in 2017-18. With public debt
rising and large external deficit, downside risks dominate the outlook and stem from possible
declines in SACU revenues and commodity prices, lower growth in mining and construction, and
corrections in housing prices and domestic credit. With limited buffers, shocks could be amplified by
abrupt policy responses, especially if combined with sovereign credit rating downgrades. Against
this outlook, Namibia’s key policy challenges are to preserve macroeconomic stability with
additional fiscal adjustment to maintain debt sustainability, while minimizing the effects on growth,
manage risks from the financial sector, and make inroads in reducing high unemployment and
income inequality.
30.
The 2016 budget marked a welcome shift to a tighter fiscal stance, but additional
fiscal adjustment is needed to bring public debt on a declining path. Staff welcomes the
authorities’ intention to strengthen their adjustment plans as envisaged in the FY16/17 Mid-Year
Budget Review. The additional adjustment should be carefully designed to reduce the impact on
growth. It needs to be spread over time and based on quality measures with low short-term
multipliers. A combination of revenue measures and expense reductions, while protecting capital
and social spending, would minimize the growth impact. Policies should include limiting the public
wage bill, curtailing transfers to SOEs and other entities, and increase indirect tax revenues. Fiscal
structural reforms to enhance the country’s public financial management systems and strengthen
revenue administration would create space for fiscal adjustment, and ensure equitable burden
sharing. Concrete progress on reforming SOEs to improve their oversight, governance, and
performance, is essential to lower budget transfers, and improve growth and public services.
31.
Fiscal consolidation will support external adjustment and safer levels of reserves, while
lifting pressure on monetary policy. In this context, the BoN should maintain the policy rate at
par, or with limited positive spread, with the SARB’s rate to support the peg, and sustain healthier
international reserve levels.
32.
Risks from fast growing housing prices, household indebtedness, and links between
banks and large non-bank financial institutions should be carefully monitored and managed.
Staff welcomed the recent introduction of LTV limits for non-primary residence purchases, and
encouraged the authorities to complement the new regulation with DSTI limits and explore
22

additional macro-prudential measures as needed. As investment funds and their linkages with banks
are macro critical, the authorities should monitor and assess possible financial stability risks from
such linkages. In this context, they should accelerate their plans to improve the financial regulatory
architecture and provide the BoN with the necessary powers to assess macro-financial risks and
exercise macro-prudential control for the whole financial sector.
33.
A package of well-targeted structural reforms and reforms of social programs could
significantly boost job creation and deliver more inclusive growth. Staff supports the
authorities’ commitment to structural reforms and better targeting of social programs. Structural
reforms should focus on reducing skill mismatches (e.g., improving access to higher and vocational
education, on-job training) and simplifying business regulations (e.g., starting businesses, registering
property, and reducing labor market restrictions) as they have the highest potential to boost
employment and deliver more inclusive growth. Better targeting of key social assistance programs,
including cash transfers and housing subsidies, could make further inroads in reducing inequality
and poverty.
34.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Namibia be held on the
standard 12-month cycle.

Annex I. External Sector Assessment
This annex assesses: (i) external imbalances and long term vulnerabilities, (ii) the adequacy of
international reserve coverage, and (iii) the level of the exchange rate.

A. External Sector Imbalances and Long-Term Vulnerabilities
1.
Since 2006, Namibia’s current account (CA) balance has been constantly deteriorating,
raising the possibility that structural vulnerabilities are building up. Following stable surpluses
in the first half of the 2000s, the CA balance turned negative in 2009 and reached a deficit of
13.7 percent in 2015. The deterioration has been mainly driven by a widening trade deficit
(25 percent of GDP in 2015), despite a REER depreciation, only partially offset by higher SACU
transfers that have smoothed the impact on the current account. The larger CA deficits have been
largely financed by increased FDI and lower portfolio outflows.
2.
The recent CA deterioration is explained mainly by changes in volumes with price
variations playing a minor role. With the

As customary, the change in the CA balance can be decomposed into changes in: export and import volumes,
terms-of-trade, and other non-trade flows (e.g., service, income, transfers).

A sizable component of the trade deficit appears to be structural rather than cyclical,
suggesting that CA deficits should be expected in the future. Different methods can be used to
isolate the structural and cyclical components,

percent of GDP, comparable to the CA norm
estimated under the IMF’s EBA-lite CA model (see ** Estimate from EBA-lite CA model
below). In this context, SACU transfers and financial flows will continue to play a key stabilizing role
in the Namibian economy to finance future trade deficits.

B. International Reserve Adequacy
Namibia’s international reserves have been declining since 2009 and only in 2015, boosted by the
government’s international bond issuance, have approached the lower bound of the desired level
according to the IMF’s metric. However, they are expected to remain below the optimal level after
2016. Given subdued medium-term prospects for SACU transfers and the fixed exchange rate, it is
important to implement policies that could avoid the constant decline in reserves experienced in the
past and help secure safer reserve buffers to face future shocks.
Recent trends
5.
Namibia’s international reserves have been declining since their peak in 2009 only
temporarily boosted by the government’s international bond issuances. Over the last five years,
reserves declined from a peak of US$1.9 billion,
equivalent to 3.9 months of imports in 2009 to
US$1.2 billion in 2014 or 1.8 months of imports.
At end 2015, reserves stood at US$1.6 billion,
16.8 percent of GDP or 2.8 months of imports,
boosted by the issuance of a 10-year Eurobond
(US$750 million). However, by June 2016, reserve
coverage had already fallen to around two
months of imports. The import coverage is
expected to recover to 2.7 months by end-2016
2

HP filter is applied to real export and import. BP filter separates periodic fluctuations between 6 and 32 quarters,
while removing components at higher and lower frequencies. The non-statistical approach removes one-off imports
and, in addition, cyclical factors for exports using a BP filter. Actual historical series of services, income, and transfers
are added to the structural trade deficit to derive the structural CA balance. The filtering approach is backwardlooking and does not account for any future events.

due to currency swaps with the Government Institutions Pension Fund (GIPF) and NamPower. Under
Staff’s baseline scenario, import coverage would further decline to 2.5 months in the coming years
as the financial account returns to its long-term average.
Reserve Adequacy
6.
Reserve adequacy is assessed using the composite IMF metric for market access
countries that captures vulnerabilities from multiple sources. Traditional metrics of reserve
adequacy usually focus on specific external vulnerability risks and fail to provide an overall view of
coverage against likely risks. The IMF metric is designed to measure the vulnerabilities that might
arise in a country’s balance of payments during exchange market pressure events. More specifically,
it takes into account four specific sources of risk: (i) low export earnings that could arise from a
terms of trade shock; (ii) low rollover rates of short-term debt at remaining maturity (short term
debt plus debt service); (iii) non-resident capital outflows on portfolio investments plus medium and
long-term debt; and (iv) resident capital flight proxied by broad money. The relative risk weights for
each of these component are based on observed outflows from emerging market countries during
past periods of exchange market pressures. 3
7.
The IMF’s metric could be better tailored to the Namibia case by accounting for the
significant role of SACU transfers in Namibia’s current account. As member of the Southern
Africa Customs Union (SACU), Namibia receives a share of SACU’s tax revenue as a transfer from
South Africa. Over the last five years these transfers averaged about 11 percent of GDP, but shown
large volatility, exposing the Namibia economy to SACU transfer shocks that depend on the
performance of South African economy. One way to account for the SACU transfer risk is to adjust
the IMF’s standard metric by adding a SACU risk component.4
Assessment
8.
In 2015, Namibia’s international reserves approached the lower bound of the IMF’s
metric. Reserves on the range of 100-150 percent of the composite metric (in figures below, the
shadowed area indicate the lower and upper bounds) are considered to be adequate. For Namibia,
this corresponds to reserves between 20.7 and 31 percent of GDP, or between 3.6 and 5.4 months of
imports. In the past fifteen years, the level of reserves has been sub-optimal about 80 percent of the
time and was only adequate in 2008, 2009, and 2011 due to a combination of one-off events such as
higher SACU transfers, mining revenues, the 2011 international bond issuance, and some
expenditure restraint. In 2015, the level of reserves rose to about 80 percent of the minimum
adequate level (73 percent of the Namibia tailored metric) mostly because of the government

SACU revenue are introduced in the metric using a 20 percent risk weight. This weight is computed as the average
of the declines during the previous fiscal crisis (in 2010-11) and the one observed in 2016.

Eurobond issuance. Looking ahead, in absence of reserve boosting events, reserves are expected to
decline to only about 60 percent of the minimum adequate level.5

9.
Going forward, adequate policies should help secure safer levels of international
reserve buffers. The IMF metric analysis suggests that Namibia should aim to increase its
international reserve to at least 3.5 months of imports (3.8 accounting for SACU-related risks).
Gradually building such buffer would be highly desirable given the bleak prospects for SACU
revenue and the fixed exchange rate. In this respect, sufficient fiscal restraint and additional foreign
financing (particularly FDI as structural reforms take place) would help to avoid future decline in
reserves and build additional buffers toward achieving a safer level of reserve coverage.

C. Exchange Rate Assessment
The Namibia’s real effective exchange rate (REER) is moderately overvalued compared to the level that
would be consistent with fundamentals. However, the estimated misalignment is crucially dependent
on the assumption that the deterioration in the current account partly reflects temporary import needs
from the construction of major mining projects, which are not related to the developments of the REER
and were mostly financed with FDI.
Background
10.
Namibia’s current account (CA) has been deteriorating since 2006 driven by rapid
import growth. From stable surpluses registered in the first half of the 2000s, the CA moved to
widening deficits in the second half of the century. This trend can be mostly attributed to rapid
import growth, partly associated with construction requirements in the mining sector. In 2015, the
CA registered a deficit of 13.7 percent of GDP, which is expected to shrink and to stabilize at about
5.5 percent of GDP in the medium-term as new mining projects come to full production.

5

In August 2009 Namibia also received US$200 million from an additional SDR allocation.

42

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NAMIBIA

11.
Increasing gross external financing requirements have been mostly financed with FDIs
and other investments, except in 2015 when portfolio investments played a major role. In
2015, gross external financing requirements rose to about 32 percent of GDP in 2015 and were
mostly covered by FDIs and long term loans to the mining sector (other investments), while net
portfolio investments, typically negative as institutional investors invest abroad, turned positive as
the government issued a Eurobond. In the same year, net FDI also increased by about 5 percent of
GDP due to a one-off bond equity swap, which reduced other investments by roughly the same
amount.
12.
Namibia’s REER has been depreciated since 2010, with an aceleration in 2015. On
average, Namibia’s REER has depreciated by about 30 percent since end-2010, and 12 percent only
in 2015, (although it has recovered somewhat in 2016). Since the Namibian dollar is pegged to the
South African rand, the depreciation has largely followed rand developments, although in real terms
the depreciation has been slightly lower than in South Africa. At present, the REER is about
10 percent below its 10-year average. In 2016, the currency has appreciated somewhat.

Methodology
13.
The assessment of Namibia’s REER is conducted using three alternative
methodologies: two regression-based analyses (the CA and REER EBA-lite models) and a model
free analysis based on the sustainability of the
net foreign asset (NFA) position (External
Sustainability EBA-lite approach). The EBA-lite
assumes that the CA and the REER are both
endogenous variables that are simultaneously
determined as a function of domestic and
external variables.6 In doing so, it uses annual
data for 146 countries for the 1995−2015
period, and incorporates fundamentals for low
and middle-income countries. As a result, the
methodology assesses the CA and REER in a
multi-lateral consistent manner, as each country’s variables are measured relative to a weightedaverage of other countries’ values.7


EBA-lite CA. This model defines the CA gap as the difference between the observed CA deficit
and an estimated “norm” based on domestic and external variables including economic
fundamentals, policy variables, cyclical conditions, and the global environment. The CA gap is
decomposed further into deviations of policies variables from their adequate levels (policy gap)
and to regression residuals (the unexplained portion of the model).



EBA-lite REER. This approach estimates the REER norm based on the same fundamentals used
in the EBA-lite CA approach with the addition of the real short-term interest rate, which has
proved to be an important determinant of short-run behavior of exchange rates.



External sustainability (ES). The model analyzes the sustainability of the NFA position based
on an assumption about the desired level to stabilize the NFA to GDP ratio. Since there is no
optimality condition for this ratio, various policy scenarios (target values) are typically assumed.

Assessment
14.
Both the EBA-lite CA model and the ES approach point to a weaker external position
than implied by medium-term fundamentals (i.e., overvaluation), while the REER model
suggests a minor undervaluation (Table 1).

6

Since the CA and REER are measured relative to other countries, they not only reflect a country’s own characteristics
but also external conditions within a simultaneously determined framework.
7

For more details, see the EBA methodology in IMF (2013b).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NAMIBIA



CA and ES models. Both the EBA-lite CA model and the ES approach suggest that the CA gap is
sizable at about 4-5¾ percent of GDP.
 According to the CA model, the CA gap is estimated to be -5.7 percent of GDP (fitted value of
the regression is a CA deficit is 8.2 of GDP compared to an expected CA deficit of 13.7 percent
in 2015). The gap is in part explained by residual components. This implies that a significant
part of the CA gap comes from uncertainties due to volatile capital flows and temporary
factors, including: temporary changes in oil import and mining export prices, and an import
surge financed by FDI related to the development of new mines). The CA gap is then converted
into an REER misalignment based on the estimated elasticity of the trade balance to changes in
the REER (-0.25). According to this approach, the REER is overvalued by about 22½ percent, i.e.,
the currency would need to depreciate by this amount for the CA deficit to be reduced to the
fitted value of the regression.
 The ES approach points to a similar overvaluation. Using different scenario assumptions for the
NFA to GDP ratio, targeting this ratio to: scenario (1) 5 percent of GDP (i.e., the 2015 level), the
REER is overvalued by about 18 percent; and scenario (2) 8.7 percent of GDP (i.e., the average
between 1995-2015), the REER would be overvalued by about 16-18 percent (Table 1).



REER model. Differently from the other approaches, the REER Model suggests that the REER is
undervalued and would need to appreciate by about 10 percent to reach the fitted value of the
regression. This result however should be interpreted with caution as it does not capture recent
structural changes in the Namibian economy (e.g., development of new uranium, gold, and
copper mines, and fast-growing real estate market), which would have driven faster growth in
investment and the REER appreciation due to weaker current account once they are
incorporated into the REER model.8

15.
Namibia’s REER misalignment is possibly smaller as the recent deterioration in the CA
does not seem related to exchange rate developments. In particular, the CA deficit is expected to
eventually improve because imports are expected to fall as major mining construction projects come
to an end and exports increase as the new mines rump up production. If imports from large
construction projects are excluded, the CA deficit is estimated to be about 4.7 percentage points of
GDP lower and the estimated overvaluation in the REER would only be about 4 percent.9 The
overvaluation could further be corrected if the government were to successfully embark in its
planned fiscal consolidation. Finally, given the fixed exchange rate with the rand and the fact that
about 60 percent of imports come from South Africa, a nominal depreciation would not necessarily
result in CA improvements.

8

This approach has the shortcoming that it relies on fixed effect estimation, which forces each country’s regression
residuals to sum to zero over the sample period, which may make the results less reliable for countries with a short
sample or where large structural changes have occurred which are not captured by the regression.
9

In 2015 construction at the Husab uranium mine, the port of Walvis Bay, and Tschudi copper project continued. The
overall investment for these projects is estimated at 5.9 percent of GDP in 2015 and 2.1 percent in 2016.

1/ The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is
the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a
probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks
may interact and materialize jointly. “Short term” and “medium term” are meant to indicate that the risk could materialize within 1 year and 3 years, respectively.

Annex III. Debt Sustainability Analysis
Namibia’s debt sustainability indicators and outlook have recently deteriorated, particularly for public
debt. The recent increase in central government debt and the high gross financing needs raise both
sustainability and liquidity concerns. The public debt outlook is exposed to risks from delays or
insufficient fiscal consolidation, historically volatile SACU revenue, and macro-economic shocks. Risks
from exchange rate and rollover needs have increased because of the larger share of dollar
denominated debt and the increased reliance on short-term debt. The profile of external debt indicates
vulnerability to exchange rate depreciation and current account shocks.

A. Public Debt
Background
1.
Namibia’s public debt has been rising since 2010, driven by large primary deficits.
Between FY10/11 and FY15/16, the debt to GDP ratio has more than doubled from 16 percent to
39.8 percent of GDP (44.7 percent of GDP including guarantees), with the primary deficit averaging
4½ percent of GDP over the same period. As a result, in 2015 public debt exceeded the authorities’
own debt limit (35 percent of GDP).
2.
The authorities have been recently diversifying their funding sources and borrowing
instruments, expanding external borrowing and extending the yield curve. In 2015, they issued
a new US$750 million ten-year Eurobond (the previous issuance was in 2011) and randdenominated bonds for R1,550 million. On the domestic side, three new fixed-rate bonds were
introduced to fill the gaps in the yield curve and extend the maturity structure to 30 years, in
addition to new inflation-linked bonds.
3.
The composition of public debt bears some exchange rate and rollover risks. As of
end-2015, about 42 percent of public debt was denominated in non-rand foreign currencies (mainly
US dollar). 1 Short-term treasury bills accounted for about 43 percent of government’s domestic
debt, about 1 percentage points higher than last year.

Outlook and Risks
4.
The DSA baseline reflects staff macroeconomic projections and modifications to the
authorities’ funding strategy to account for large financing needs (see main text). Under staff
baseline, gross financing needs are larger than projected by the government in its medium-term
fiscal framework. To fill the gap, projections assume additional bond issuances, both in the domestic
market and in the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE), and T-bills; they also assume the rollover of

exchange rate arrangements.

the November 2011 Eurobond coming due in 2021. Finally, guaranteed debt is expected to remain
on the high side to reflect the authorities’ intention to provide SOEs with guarantees for financing
new capital projects (see MTEF 2016/17-2018-19).2
5.
Debt sustainability analysis suggests that the debt ratio (including guaranteed debt)
will continue rising over the projection period, approaching the distress threshold (Figures 24). Under the baseline scenario, public debt will remain below the debt stress threshold of 70
percent of GDP, but including guaranteed debt would approach the distress threshold by 2021/22.
With the primary deficit remaining below the debt stabilizing level, and considerable reliance on
short-term debt, gross financing needs are expected to average about 19 percent over the
projection period, above the distress threshold (10 percent of GDP).
6.
Stress analysis suggests the debt level and gross financing needs are particularly
exposed to risks from macroeconomic shocks. A macro-fiscal shock—entailing shocks to growth
and interest rates, and a temporary lower primary balance—would result in a sharp increase in the
debt-to-GDP ratio and gross financing needs to 93 and 30 percent, respectively (Figure 5). A
contingent liability shock (with default of all guaranteed debt, equivalent to 20 percent of noninterest expenditures, combined with real GDP and interest rate shocks) and a SACU revenue shock
(with a 5 percent of GDP reduction in SACU revenue, a temporary 2 percentage points real GDP
growth shock and 225bps increase in interest rates) would result in an increase in the debt-to-GDP
ratio and gross financing needs to about 80 and 27 percent of GDP, respectively. Exchange rate and
real GDP shocks have slightly smaller effect on debt, with limited impact on gross financing needs
(Figure 5).
7.
Under a reform scenario, public debt and gross financing needs would gradually trend
down and remain below critical thresholds. Under this scenario (see main text), additional
measures of about 5 percent of GDP, spread over three years, would bring debt on a decline path
and to around 49 percent of GDP by 2021/22, and contain gross financing needs on average to
about 13 percent of GDP over the projection period.

9.
Namibia's external debt is projected to rise further in 2016, before stabilizing over the
projection period at relatively moderate levels as the non-interest current account deficit
narrows. The external debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to rise from 51 percent in 2015 to about
60½ percent of GDP in 2016, and stabilize over the projection period around this level. The
non-interest current account deficit (CAD) is expected to be close to the debt-stabilizing level,
supporting a slightly declining debt ratio (Table 1). Gross external financing needs (GEFN) are
projected to average about 26 percent of GDP over the period 2016-2021, with short-term debt
amortization amount to about 30 percent of the GEFN.
10.
Sensitivity tests suggest that Namibia’s external debt is particularly vulnerable to a
current account and real depreciation shocks. Standardized sensitivity analysis indicates that a
30 percent exchange rate depreciation in 2017 would increase external debt to about 72 percent of
GDP, as about 20 percent of the external debt is denominated in foreign currency. Assuming that
the non-interest CAD would widen by an additional 4.2 percent of GDP (one-half standard deviation
shock) during 2017-21, external debt would increase to about 78 percent of GDP by 2021. The
impact of real interest rate shocks is contained due to the sizeable share of fixed-interest-rate debt.

1/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms, g = real GDP growth rate,
e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels
of the last projection year.

Despite their large exposure to mortgage loans, banks remain resilient to large house
price corrections with pressures arising only under tail risk scenarios. Mortgages represent
about half of bank’s assets, and a possible sharp reversal of current house price trends could
potentially have large impact on bank’s balance sheets. The recent increases in interest rates could
further amplify vulnerabilities. Using latest bank-by-bank balance sheet and income data available

This annex updates and extends the analysis and results of the 2015 Selected Issues Paper: “Namibia: MacroFinancial Risks Associated with Housing Boom” (IMF Country Report No. 15/277), which provides details about
methodology and stress tests.

Anecdotal evidence suggests that commercial real estate prices are also rapidly increasing. Residential mortgages
account for about ¾ of total outstanding mortgages.
In 2013, the government set up the Mass-Housing Program to ameliorate supply side shortages (see IMF Country
Report No. 15/277). The program was halted in May 2015 after the SOE in charge failed to raise funding. It resumed
on a smaller scale in the summer 2016. The program focuses on supporting low income individuals without access to
credit.

(June 2016), staff’s stress tests suggest that banks remain resilient to house price shocks. Under a
severe adverse risk scenario (entailing a real growth slowdown to 1.5 percent over three years, a 15
percent fall in housing prices, and 300 bps interest rate increase), all banks could be able to absorb
the shock and comply with the capital requirement (10 percent of RWA), albeit with some
deleveraging. In an extreme tail-case scenario with a prolonged recession (10 percent contraction in
real GDP), some banks could face difficulties in complying with capital requirements, the system
would go through substantial deleveraging and bank credit could potentially decline by 20 percent.
In both cases, deleveraging could be lower if banks use part of their profits to offset losses.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has shortcomings but is broadly adequate for surveillance. The authorities provide
monthly core data to the Fund with a lag of one to two months, except for national accounts, fiscal data,
external sector statistics, and trade data, which are reported quarterly and annually with longer lags. The
Namibia Statistics Agency (NSA) was transformed into a fully autonomous agency in 2011 to enhance the
capacity to collect and compile high quality national statistics.

National Accounts: The base year for national accounts (NA) is 2010. Quarterly national accounts (QNA)
estimates at constant prices are disseminated on the NSA’s website, though there is a need to improve its
source data and coverage. Plans by NSA to produce current price QNA estimates are ongoing. The NSA is
assessing the integration of VAT data in the NA compilation framework. The NA are produced bi-annually
and revised for the past three years. Major revisions for back years such as correction of errors and changes
to the economic structure to reflect current economic situations occur at longer intervals. In recent years, TA
in NA has been limited due to low interest from the statistical office.
Price Statistics: The base year for the consumer price index (CPI) is 2012. The index provides an adequate
presentation of citizens’ spending patterns. The CPI weights, introduced in the December 2012 index, were
derived from the 2009/10 Household Income and Expenditure Survey. Labor market data, including labor
force, employment, and wages are only collected on an annual basis (the latest annual labor force survey is
for 2014). Assisted by the AFRITAC South, NSA launched a project to develop a producer price index (PPI).
Government Finance Statistics: Aggregated annual budgetary central government data by fiscal year are
reported on a cash basis in the GFSM 2001 format, but lack detailed classifications and balance sheet data.
No fiscal statistics are disseminated for extra budgetary institutions, consolidated central government,
consolidated general government. Similarly, limited data is available to assess fiscal risks, including from
public corporations.
Monetary and Finance Statistics: The Bank of Namibia (BoN) reports monthly monetary statistics based on
standardized report forms (SRFs) for the BoN balance sheet and Other Depository Corporations (banks and
money market funds). Concepts and definitions are broadly in line with the Monetary and Financial Statistics
(MFS) manual. In September 2016 a TA mission visited the BoN to prepare the standardized report for the
sectoral balance sheet of Other Financial Corporations (OFCs) (SRF 4SR). The BoN is expected to begin
reporting OFC data covering pension funds, insurance companies and the Development Bank in 2017.
Financial Soundness Indicators: The BoN reports Financial Soundness Indicators (FSIs) for commercial
banks on a quarterly basis. Banks classified as “specialized institutions” are not covered. Some improvements
are needed for historical data, which will be submitted by the BoN by early 2017. No FSIs are provided for
non-bank financial institutions.

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NAMIBIA

Balance of Payment and International Investment Position Statistics: The BoN reports balance of
payments (BOP) and international investment position (IIP) data on a quarterly basis with a lag of one
quarter. Data is subject to substantial revisions. The BOP methodology is consistent with the fifth edition of
the IMF’s BOP Manual. There is room to improve the compilation of external sector statistics, particularly to
reduce large errors and omissions and shorten publication time. The BoN has enhanced the compilation of
capital and financial transactions and IIP statistics. However, further work is needed to expand the IIP
coverage and ensure its consistency with BOP and MFS data.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Namibia has participated in GDDS /e-GDDS since 2002. A ROSC (Data Module) was published in 2002 and
updated in 2005. In June 2016 Namibia implemented the recommendations of the Enhanced General Data
Dissemination System (e-GDDS) by launching a National Summary Data Page (NSDP), which serves as a
one-stop publication vehicle for essential macroeconomic and financial data in both human and machinereadable formats.
III. Reporting to STA
The MOF regularly reports annual data for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook. Work
for reporting higher frequency data is ongoing. The BoN also regularly reports MFS, BOP and IIP data for
publication in the International Financial Statistics (IFS) and the Balance of Payments Yearbook.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Statement by Mr. Mkwezalamba, Executive Director for Namibia
and Mr. Sishi Alternate Executive Director
December 2, 2016

The Namibian authorities thank staff for the constructive and candid discussions during the
Article IV consultation. They are broadly in agreement with staff’s assessment of the
challenges facing the economy, and share staff’s views on the need to address fiscal and
external vulnerabilities, as well as the urgency of implementing much-needed structural
reforms. Discussions during the consultations contributed to the formulation of their
ambitious fiscal consolidation strategy. These are reflected in the recent 2016 mid-year
budget and the Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement for the 2017/18 – 2019/20 MediumTerm Expenditure Framework (MTEF), both of which were presented in October 2016.
In the years following the financial crisis, real growth in GDP exceeded 5 percent on average
per year, underpinned by relatively low inflation and favorable domestic credit conditions.
However, falling commodity export prices and a slowdown in the economies of trading
partners have weighed on growth and government revenues. At the same time, efforts to
address long-standing challenges of poverty and unemployment have eroded fiscal and
external buffers that must now be restored. Nevertheless, Namibia’s growth outlook is still
positive and reflects an economy that is resilient, with strong fundamentals and effective
policy management.
Recent economic developments and outlook
The Namibian economy grew in real terms by 5.3 percent in 2015, compared to 6.4 percent
in 2014. The main contributors to growth were the construction sector and the public sector,
while wholesale and retail sectors grew at a slower pace due to deterioration of household
balance sheets. Although the major primary sectors of agriculture and mining declined due to
the exogenous factors of drought and lower international commodity prices, private
construction of new and existing mines, and increases in public sector investment in
transportation infrastructure, saw the secondary sector grow strongly during this period.
The inflation rate rose to 6.9 percent in September 2016, compared to 3.4 percent over the
same period in 2015. Inflation has been driven by rising housing costs, currency depreciation
and higher food prices across the region as a result of drought conditions.

2
The current account deteriorated to around 13 percent of GDP in 2015 on the back of importintensive construction by both the mining industry and the public sector. In addition, the
decline in SACU contributed to the deterioration of the current account since the size of these
revenues have amounted to around 12 percent of GDP in recent years, but are expected to
decline to 9 percent of GDP in 2015/16. The completion of large infrastructure projects in
2015, including the Husab uranium mine, is envisaged to increase export earnings and
improve the external position.
In the first quarter of 2016 GDP increased by 3.4 percent before a contraction of 1.2 percent
was recorded in the second quarter. Nevertheless, the recent years’ capital investments and
improvements in agriculture present upside risks to growth as real GDP is expected to grow
by 2.5 percent in 2016, implying a marginal rise in per capita incomes. Forecasting
assumptions rely on a significant bottoming-out in agriculture, and some improvements in
mining output, including a resurgence of metal ore output and aquatic diamond operations
that will resume after the completion of a major ship maintenance project. Against this
background, medium-term growth is projected to rebound to around 4.5 percent and 4.9
percent in 2017 and 2018, respectively. Namibia’s economy is thus still projected by both
staff and the authorities to exceed average growth rates for the region in the foreseeable
future.
Given the current fiscal consolidation efforts and the small size of Namibia’s population,
much of the growth recovery is expected in the external sector, with exports projected to
grow by 4.5 percent in 2016, compared to a contraction of 11.4 percent in 2015.
Fiscal policy
The government’s sovereign debt management strategy caps public debt-to-GDP at 35
percent. However, a combination of slower growth and increased spending on development
initiatives saw financing needs for the revised deficit of over 8 percent of GDP increase and
the stock of debt rise to 40.1 percent at the end of 2015/16. The new debt stabilization
strategy envisages public debt peaking at 42.4 percent in 2016/17, and thereafter a frontloaded fiscal adjustment is expected to reduce it to under 35 percent by 2019/20.
The recently tabled mid-year budget policy statement is a strong response to the policy
imperatives faced by the authorities. Front-loaded fiscal consolidation, balanced with specific
revenue measures and shifts in the composition of expenditure, has already begun and
spending cuts amounting to 2.8 percent of GDP in the current year have been enacted by
Parliament, with further cuts of around 6 percent of GDP over the next three years beginning
in 2017/18. These cuts include the suspension of non-essential government capital projects
that have not yet commenced, freezing civil service recruitment, and reductions in the
spending ceiling for national defense. In the meantime, spending on core items such as
materials and supplies for social service departments, and the employer’s contribution to
social security, has been protected. Although an impact on the economy can be expected, this
strategy is consistent with the advice of staff to target high-quality cuts and avoid exacerbating
the structural problems in the economy.

3
Improving revenue mobilisation is a priority for the authorities. In this regard, a number of
measures have been introduced, including the implementation of a new carbon tax, and an
increase in the fuel levy. In addition, various weaknesses in revenue administration are being
addressed, such as a program for the recovery of tax arrears from VAT. Furthermore, a
significant structural reform is being introduced in February 2017 with the tabling of the
Namibia Revenue Agency Bill, which establishes an autonomous Revenue Agency for the
first time.
The resulting budget effectively places the current fiscal path on a different trajectory from
that reflected in staff’s baseline scenario for debt sustainability and it is even stronger than
the policy implications in staff’s adjustment scenario. The budget should thus instill
confidence and negate the need for abrupt policy action going forward.
Monetary and exchange rate policy
In the last two years, the repurchase rate has been raised by 100 basis points, and going
forward inflation is expected to moderate in the first half of 2017 as drought conditions
subside and as supply constraints in housing continue to be alleviated by the government’s
large scale housing program. Meanwhile, credit growth to both corporates and households
slowed to 12 percent in the first nine months of 2016, from 15.6 percent in the corresponding
period of 2015 . This is a welcome moderation in response to tighter monetary policy and this
level of credit extension remains supportive of financial deepening and economic
growth.
The exchange rate peg to the South African rand has contributed to lower inflation. However,
the persistence of lower growth in neighboring economies and monetary tightening in the US
present significant risks to the outlook. Poor growth and a rise in US interest rates is likely to
dampen capital inflows into the region as the US yield curve steepens, and a weaker exchange
rate for both the rand and the Namibian dollar would counteract the moderation of
inflation and interest rates. In line with current policy, the authorities will continue to closely
monitor developments in the rand, as well as broader macro-economic developments.
Although the issuance of a USD750 million Eurobond in December 2015 contributed to a
higher debt stock, the use of USD300 million of the proceeds to supplement reserves and the
asset swap arrangement with pension fund managers led to improvements in the level of
international reserves to an import cover of 2.9 months in October 2016, compared to a 2.1
months of prospective imports registered earlier in the year. The authorities remain
committed to taking advantage of opportunities to further build reserves.
Financial sector stability
Namibia’s financial sector is stable, and banks can absorb moderate shocks arising from the
residential market. The authorities’ most recent financial stability review found that supply
constraints are a major driver of house price inflation and that most NPLs emanate from
mortgages. However, NPLs are currently at only 1.6 percent, well below the 4 percent trigger

4
level, and provisions in the banking system have been adequate, generally moving in line
with NPLs.
The authorities are strongly committed to improved monitoring and supervisory action over
NBFIs, and have assessed the current risks as unchanged when compared to the previous
year. Furthermore, the majority of NBFIs in Namibia are dual-listed companies that are
subsidiaries of South African banks and NBFIs. Accordingly, macro-prudential regulations
and risk-based supervision by their home-country authorities must be taken into account in
the financial sector stability assessment. Against this background, the Financial Stability
Policy Framework for Namibia has been finalized. The framework encompasses legislative
measures to improve coordination across institutions. The Bank of Namibia (BON) will play
a leading role in monitoring systemic risks emanating from the interconnectedness of the
financial system, particularly between banks and non-banks. The Namibia Financial
Institutions Supervisory Authority (NAMFISA) is focused on building its technical capacity
over the medium term, and the authorities wish to express their gratitude for the technical
assistance that is being received from the Fund during the completion of this process.
The Financial Institutions and Markets (FIM) bill is likely to be enacted during the current
financial year and, among other things, it will de-mutualize the Namibian Stock Exchange
(NSX), thus opening up share ownership to a broader market. Furthermore, a Financial
System Stability Committee, comprising the BON, NAMFISA and the Ministry of Finance, is
now extensively monitoring three aspects of NBFIs, namely: the contagion amongst
financial institutions, asset exposure to capital markets, and Namibia Stock Exchange (NSX)
asset price inflation.
Household debts pose a more serious risk to the financial system in the medium term than
NBFIs. The ratio of household debt to disposable income rose to 89.1 percent at the end of
2015, placing it on par with, and exceeding some, advanced economies. As evidenced by the
above-mentioned decline in private credit growth, monetary tightening and stricter credit
limits will curb excessive credit and address demand-side effects on house prices. The Credit
Agreement Act, which was passed in June 2016, includes regulations stipulating loan-tovalue (LTV) limits for secondary mortgages and minimum down-payments for motor
vehicles. The authorities will take into account factors such as housing supply constraints and
any negative social impact before implementing further measures.
Structural reforms
Namibia’s structural reform agenda is focused on addressing high unemployment, inequality
and poverty through the National Development Plan (NDP). The NDP is reviewed on a 5year basis and since the inauguration of a new government in 2015, a program known as the
Harambee Prosperity Plan has been introduced. It links the objectives of the NDP with the 3year budget cycle by laying out a set of four objectives specifically for the medium-term,
namely; promoting inclusive growth and job creation; development and investment in
priority infrastructure; ensuring macro-economic stability and growth-friendly fiscal policy;
and implementing targeted measures to reduce poverty and vulnerability.

5
Crowding-in private investment is central to government reform efforts. The broad approach
to structural reforms is to promote partnerships between the public and private sector in
specific industries that will help the economy diversify further beyond commodity
production. In this regard, a new Public-Private Partnership bill was tabled and passed into
law in November 2016 and a separate structure has been created within the Ministry of
Finance to facilitate financial and legal processes for specific projects where private sector
investment can be crowded-in for economic infrastructure projects. A major feature of the
new law is the establishment of an inter-sectoral committee that will approve all bids for
infrastructure projects. These projects range from affordable housing, irrigation schemes,
energy, logistics, manufacturing and tourism. Feasibility studies for some of these have
already been completed. Special economic zones for large-scale industrial developments are
provided for in a new Investment Act that was recently enacted by Parliament.
High income inequality is generally the result of unemployment or under-employment. The
authorities see the Harambee Prosperity Plan (HPP) as the most important tool to address
unemployment and inequality. These measures are underpinned by policies to strengthen
public institutions and build human capital The Namibian Training Authority (NTA) is a
government agency created to help address skills mismatches identified in the NDP and the
HPP. In addition, the HPP’s focus on strategic industries is also meant to address youth
unemployment in the country. Furthermore, a Ministry of Poverty Eradication and Social
Welfare has also been established to develop solutions to poverty and child vulnerability, in
line with one of the objectives of the HPP. The specific goal is to ensure a focused approach
to dealing with poverty and social assistance in the country.
In addition to the creation of a modern tax administration structure, a new Ministry of Public
Enterprises has been formed. It’s mandate is to implement the provisions of the Public
Enterprises Governance Act and compliance with new reporting framework for SOEs. The
Ministry will also ensure that mandate overlaps are addressed and that fiscal transfers to
entities are rationalized in order to eliminate waste and duplication. It will also pursue the
partial listing of some SOEs on the NSX, which will lead to greater private sector
participation.
Conclusion
Namibia faces significant headwinds in the pursuit of industrial development and inclusive
growth. The authorities fully recognize the challenges and are determined to ensure that
macro-economic stability and fiscal sustainability remain the bedrock of future growth and
public policy. They are confident that the focus on fiscal sustainability, and the investments
undertaken in recent years to improve transportation infrastructure and increase mining
production, will yield positive results. Furthemore, a more assertive approach to managing
financial sector risks will maintain financial system stability going forward. They express
their appreciation to staff for the policy advice and the contribution that the Fund has made
toward the country’s structural reform agenda.
