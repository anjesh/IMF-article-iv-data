STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION AND FOURTH REVIEW UNDER THE
EXTENDED CREDIT FACILITY ARRANGEMENT
Context: The socio-political situation has improved substantially since the 2011
Article IV Consultation, but significant challenges remain. Boosted by a surge in public
investment, economic activity rebounded quickly from the post-election crisis in early
2011. Since end-2011, the focus of policy has shifted from short-term crisis recovery to
implementation of policies to promote high and inclusive growth. Côte d’Ivoire reached
the HIPC Initiative Completion point in 2012.
Article IV discussions: The discussions focused on policies needed to achieve the
objectives of the government’s 2012–15 National Development Plan (NDP): high growth
and reducing poverty. Key policies are additional improvements in the business climate
and governance, as well as further efforts to create fiscal space, reinforce the financial
sector, and maintain external stability, while preserving the stable macroeconomic
environment.
Outlook and risks: The medium-term outlook is positive, with robust growth projected
in the years ahead. Sustained reform efforts remain needed to maintain high growth
rates over the medium term, and improve Côte d’Ivoire’s living standards, which have
deteriorated significantly since the late 1970s. A slowing down of reform efforts would
result in weaker economic growth. External risks include higher financing costs following
the end of an accommodative monetary policy in the US.
Exchange restrictions and regime: Côte d’Ivoire, a member of the WAEMU, has
accepted the obligations under Article VIII and maintains an exchange system free of
restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international
transactions. The WAEMU’s exchange regime is a conventional peg to the euro.
Program performance has been good: All quantitative performance criteria and
indicative targets at end-June 2013 were met. While considerable progress was made in
key structural reform areas, a few structural benchmarks were met with delays, and
others missed.
Staff supports the completion of the fourth review under the ECF and the
authorities’ request for an increase in the program’s limit on new nonconcessional
external debt to make room for the issuance of a Eurobond in an amount
equivalent to US$500 million. Completion of the review will result in disbursement of
an amount equivalent to SDR 48.78 million under the ECF arrangement.

BACKGROUND
Côte d’Ivoire is recovering from a long period of economic stagnation and political conflict. The
authorities have over the last two years made considerable headway toward their objective of boosting
medium-term growth to raise living standards and transform the economy into an emerging market
by 2020. Together with a surge in public investment to renew and expand public infrastructure, they
are implementing reforms, notably, to improve the business climate, strengthen the energy and
financial sectors, and reduce poverty. Sustaining high growth rates will, however, require maintaining
the reform effort over the medium term.

A. Context
1.
Following high growth in the 1960s, terms-of-trade shocks in the late 1970s
contributed to a long period of economic stagnation, compounded by political instability and
conflict from 2000 to 2011. The social cost has been severe: real per capita income in 2011 was
only about 57 percent of its peak 1978 level; the poverty rate increased from 37 percent in 1995 to
almost 50 percent in recent years; and governance indicators weakened. The 2013 UNDP Human
Development Report ranks Côte d’Ivoire among countries with low human development (168 out of
186 in the 2013 Human Development Index). Progress towards achieving the Millennium
Development Goals has been slow and the official unemployment rate was estimated at about
9½ percent in late 2012, with a much higher rate among the young, the women, and in Abidjan.

2.
The socio-political situation has improved substantially
MEFP ¶¶ 1, 2
since the end of the 2010/11 post-electoral crisis, but serious
challenges remain, including meeting expectations of improved
living standards. The administrative reunification of the country and a full election cycle have been
completed, and insecurity has declined substantially. Some progress has been made in incorporating
former combatants into the security forces and the civil service, leading the UN Security Council to
recently approve a gradual scaling down of ONUCI’s military presence. Progress towards political
reconciliation and restoring social cohesion continues, but remains difficult. In addition, the
population is anxious to see tangible improvements in living standards and higher wages.
3.
The authorities’ key challenge is to build the foundations for sustainable, robust and
inclusive growth. The 2012–15 NDP lays out a comprehensive reform agenda aimed at delivering
double-digit growth and halving the poverty rate. To this end, the government is boosting public
investment to tackle infrastructure bottlenecks and creating a more business-friendly environment.
To address poverty, it has reformed the cocoa sector, thereby increasing income of about
700 thousand farmers and raised pro-poor spending. Other measures include programs to expand
mining output, boost rice production—an important basic staple—, setting up a mechanism to
guarantee a minimum price for cotton and cashew, and establishing a universal health insurance
scheme.
4.
Macroeconomic performance since the 2011 Article IV consultation has been strong.
Following the end of the post electoral crisis, sizable external financial support and a large fiscal
stimulus helped limit the 2011 recession to 4.7 percent. The 9.8 percent rebound in economic
growth in 2012 and a projected 8.7 percent in 2013 have been further helped by an upturn in
business and consumer confidence and the impact of structural reforms, including in the cocoa
sector. Preliminary indications in 2013 point to a rise in the number of business starts, increased
employment in the formal sector, robust domestic consumption of energy, strong activity in the
construction and public works, retail, and energy sectors, as well as in the agro-food sector. Average
inflation dropped from a peak of 4.9 percent in 2011 to 1.3 percent in 2012. The overall fiscal deficit
narrowed from 5.7 percent of GDP in 2011 to 3.4 of GDP in 2012. The current account balance
moved into deficit, driven by a surge in investment-related imports and the strong economic
rebound.
5.
2011 Article IV recommendations. At the November 2011 Board meeting, Directors
emphasized the importance of broadening the tax base, limiting current spending, and
strengthening tax and expenditure administration to create fiscal space for higher investment and
social spending. They gave high priority to financial sector deepening and strengthening to support
private sector development. Directors welcomed the proposed cocoa sector reforms, noted the
significant effort needed to place the energy sector on a sound financial footing, and stressed the
importance of governance and other reforms to improve the business climate and enhance external
competitiveness

6.
Implementation of previous staff advice has been uneven. The authorities have
restructured the public external debt,1 taken steps to improve tax administration, and notably
refocused expenditure towards higher investment and social spending, while lowering the fiscal
deficit. They have also implemented major structural reforms to shore up the financial situation of
the energy sector, reform the cocoa sector, and improve the business climate. However, decisive
measures to deepen the financial sector and restructure the state-owned banks are not yet in place,
while governance and expenditure management remain weak.

B. Recent Economic Developments, Medium-Term Outlook and Risks
7.
Continued strong growth is expected in 2013 and 2014. In the near term, growth is
projected to remain robust (8.7 percent in 2013 and 8.2 percent in 2014), driven by strong public
investment. Rising private sector investment is also expected to support growth. Despite higher food
prices early in 2013, inflation would remain below the 3-percent regional convergence criterion. The
overall fiscal deficit is expected to decline to 2.7 percent of GDP in 2013 and 2.3 percent of GDP in
2014, while the primary basic fiscal deficit would narrow from 0.2 percent of GDP in 2013 to
0.1 percent of GDP in 2014. The current account deficit would increase to about 1.8 percent in 2013
and 3.1 in 2014 owing to higher imports of consumption goods and a stronger increase for capital
goods, while the balance of payments would record a small surplus, supported by higher FDI and
project loans.

8.
Medium-term growth is expected to remain high. In the staff’s projections, high growth
rates would remain at about 8 percent through 2015 and would gradually decline to about
7 percent over the medium term, while inflation would remain moderate. Growth would be driven
by a broad-based increase of private investment, in agriculture, mining, and housing, but also in
food processing and services, supported by public investment in infrastructure and the
improvement of the business climate. Exports would remain strong as a result of measures to
support agricultural production and processing, and of higher mining output (gold in particular).
The fiscal deficit would remain small at around 3 percent of GDP, while the current account deficit
would widen somewhat reflecting high imports of capital goods, financed in part by FDI and project
loans. This high-growth baseline scenario is contingent on sustained reform momentum to allow
high and efficient investment.2 It also assumes significant reforms to further improve the business
climate and governance. Box 2, which analyzes best practices from non-natural resource producing
countries in Africa with a high-growth record, underlines the importance of achieving a sustained
increase in investment. Also, it is noteworthy that 5 out of 6 of the fast-growing countries in Box 2
delivered very rapid productivity (TFP) growth making an important contribution to overall growth;
while recent structural reforms in Côte d’Ivoire have resulted in a return to positive productivity
growth after 3 decades of negative growth, it has not yet achieved the productivity growth rate of
the best performing countries, which underscores the need for additional progressive reforms to
further strengthen the business climate.

Côte d’Ivoire’s concentration of investment on projects removing infrastructure bottlenecks and a systematic
assessment of profitability of the projects planned are in that respect reassuring.

Staff’s Views
9.
There are downside and upside risks to the medium-term scenario. While Côte d’Ivoire
has had high growth rates since the end of the crisis, sustaining high growth rates once the recovery
period is completed will require further sustained reform efforts.


The most significant downside risk is that the strong scaling-up of public investment may fail
to deliver high growth, in absence of sufficient crowding in of private sector investors. While
recent reforms have strengthened private sector confidence and the business climate, more
needs to be done to boost private investment—both FDI and domestic. Lower-thanprojected growth would narrow the fiscal space, reducing the resources available for public
investment and social spending (see Text Table 3 for an illustrative lower-growth scenario).



Lack of further progress toward political reconciliation, in particular in the run up to the 2015
presidential elections may also negatively affect growth prospects.



The population’s anxiousness to see tangible improvements in living standards and higher
wages also carries risks. While the promise of higher salaries in the civil service from 2014
has contributed to eliminating the work stoppages seen in 2012 and the first part of 2013 (in
particular in the health and education sector), a resurgence is possible.



The impact of potential external risks, including higher financing costs following the end of
an accommodative monetary policy in the US; a worsening of the economic outlook of the
main trading partners and donors; and a deterioration of the overall regional security,3
appear comparatively more limited. However, higher prices for imported basic staples such
as rice and adverse weather shocks would present significantly high risks.

CÔTE D’IVOIRE

Upside risks to the baseline scenario could arise from higher-than-projected FDI flows and
an even stronger crowding in of private investment if the NDP’s goals of creating one of the
best business climates in Africa and becoming a regional leader on good governance and
anti-corruption are materialized early on.



Authorities’ Views
10.
The authorities viewed staff projections as too conservative.
MEFP ¶18–25
Their own growth projections are much more ambitious, with real growth
rates of 9 percent in 2013 and 10 percent in 2014–15, driven by higher
private investment. They noted that staff had already had to revise its growth
projections upward on several occasions. They reiterated their commitment to implement the
reforms required for reaching the high levels of private investment in the NDP, and indicated their
readiness to adopt measures to address these downside risks, if they were to materialize.
Box 1. Côte d’Ivoire: Inclusive Growth
Poverty increased following a marked decline in real per capita income since the late 1970s and
the period of conflict from the early 2000s to the end of the post-electoral crisis of 2010–11.
Poverty indicators have not been updated since 2008, as the crisis prevented the National Statistics
Institute from carrying out a new Living Standard Measurement Survey. Yet, despite data deficiencies,
the authorities estimate that the displacements of population and the sharp deterioration of social
services in most of the country during the crisis resulted in slightly more than half the population living
below the poverty line in 2011. The 2013 human development report estimates that 61.5 percent of the
population lives in multidimensional poverty despite an increase in some human development
indicators (see table below).

Box 1. Côte d’Ivoire: Inclusive Growth (concluded)
Reducing poverty and making growth more inclusive is at the center of the
authorities’ strategy in the NDP and progress has most likely already taken
MEFP ¶8
place, although data is not available. The authorities have already adopted
measures that will alleviate poverty, such as the cocoa reform and the setting up of a minimum price
for cotton and cashew. They have also achieved a strong increase in pro-poor spending, with priority
given to the health and education sectors for new hiring and the renovation of a number of health and
education facilities. They are also considering the creation of a universal health insurance system. While
the high and broad-based growth performance in 2012 and 2013 have resulted in an increase in
employment in the formal sector and most likely in a decline in poverty incidence, data deficiencies do
not allow to assess the percentage by which poverty has been reduced.
Making growth more inclusive will remain a long-term challenge. The population is relatively
young and growing at about 3 percent per year, with the labor force growing rapidly. Employment
remains dominated by agriculture, mostly in subsistence activities and low productivity jobs. Average
skill levels in the labor force will take time to improve. Sustaining strong growth over an extended
period of time will further increase per capita income, but a key challenge in the years ahead will be to
improve human development indicators. Policy priorities will continue to include addressing the
infrastructure gaps, strengthening productivity in agriculture, investing in health, education, and
vocational training and upgrading education and skill levels to shift people from vulnerable
employment to better wage-paying jobs, supporting access to credit for smaller and newer enterprises,
facilitating the creation of markets with supporting infrastructure (such as transportation networks)
both locally and at the provincial level, and continued efforts to strengthen the basic social protection
system to help the most vulnerable.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS: BUILDING THE FOUNDATIONS
FOR STRONG GROWTH
The discussions focused on the key policies needed to achieve high growth rates
consistent with the government’s vision set out in the NDP: (i) ensuring long-term fiscal
sustainability; (ii) strengthening the financial sector; (iii) bolstering external stability and
improving the business climate; and (iv) enhancing governance.

A. Policy Theme #1: Ensuring Long-Term Fiscal Sustainability
11.
Sustaining fiscal discipline over the medium term, while preserving space for pro-poor
and infrastructure spending. The authorities have implemented prudent fiscal policies since 2011,
allowing both a major reduction in the fiscal deficit and a surge in public investment. This fiscal
stance, however, is facing increasing headwinds. On the revenue side, the tax base has been eroded
by incentives contained in the 2012 investment code and other sector codes. On the spending side,
in addition to demands for higher wages for civil servants, the significantly improved but still fragile
financial position of the electricity sector still requires sizable subsidies and bears risks.4 In addition,
fiscal and debt management has been further complicated by the need to settle longstanding
domestic arrears, the rollover risk of financing from the regional market5, and contingent liabilities in
the public sector. The planned creation of a universal health insurance system also presents fiscal
risks. The authorities have taken steps to address these pressures, including by preparing
medium-term strategies to contain the wage bill and the debt.

Staff’s Views
12.
Maintaining prudent fiscal management over the medium and long term will require a
comprehensive strategy. Staff welcomed the reduction in the deficit, but noted that further efforts
would be required to address rising budgetary pressures. In particular, staff recommended:


Continued VAT reform aimed at enlarging the tax base and mobilizing the full potential of
VAT in Côte d’Ivoire.6

4

In 2012–13, the government took action to strengthen the financial position of the electricity sector: it increased the
industrial tariff by 10 percent; the social tariff (which used to cover 80 percent of households) has been better
targeted; the transfer price of domestically-produced natural gas was reduced, and the remuneration of the private
distribution company renegotiated. Also, the distribution company introduced measures to cut fraud and reduce
technical losses, and raised the revenue collection rate in the former Northern zone.
5

This risk arises from the banks’ already large share of sovereign securities on their balance sheets and the
short-term regional maturities.

6

The September 2013 FAD mission on tax policy estimated the VAT gap at 7.9 percent of GDP, based on a
quantitative analysis of household consumption in 2012.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

CÔTE D’IVOIRE



Strengthening tax policy in general and refraining from granting further special tax
regimes to specific sectors; improving revenue administration by strengthening the large
taxpayer office, setting up a medium-size taxpayer office, and reinforcing tax and customs’
controls and audits.



Ensuring that the wage bill strategy can deliver its goal of putting the wage bill on a
sustainable financial path, bringing it down as a share of tax revenue over the medium to
long term (in compliance with the WAEMU convergence criterion). Staff noted, however, that
the wage strategy would benefit from greater front-loading and from concentrating new
hiring on health and education in the longer run.



Proceeding with caution as regards the creation of a universal health insurance
system, appropriately balancing the benefits of such a reform in terms of growth
inclusiveness with potentially large fiscal costs.



Strengthening cash planning and cash management, in particular to adequately manage
the tight cash flow position that the bunching of domestic debt repayments in the last two
months of the year will generate in 2013 and 2014 (as well as in 2016).



Continuing to reform the electricity sector by restructuring the currently regressive
tariffs to make them progressive and by introducing periodic automatic adjustments
to maintain relative prices and provide adequate incentives.

Authorities’ Views
13.
The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s recommendations. They
were generally cautious on VAT, stressing the potential social impact of
MEFP ¶7, ¶17
reforms. They indicated, however, that the 0.3 percent of GDP rise in various
taxes (including excise taxes, the tax on telecommunications, etc) included in the
draft 2014 budget would strengthen revenue mobilization and that they plan further VAT reforms in
due course.


They considered that the recently formulated wage bill strategy could deliver on its
goal to put it on a sustainable path over the medium to long term, even while also
delivering on commitments made in this area after a more than 20-year freeze of public
sector wages. They agreed with staff that the fiscal costs of a universal health insurance
system should be kept under control and assured staff that proper study of these costs was
under way.



They acknowledged that their cash position would be tight toward
the end of the year in 2013 and 2014, as noted by staff, but viewed
it as manageable. They indicated that they would actively manage cash
and the pace of expenditures to ensure timely repayment of the amounts of
domestic debt falling due that may not be rolled over.



The authorities were also cautious regarding prompt action to reform
MEFP Box 2
the electricity sector to make it financially sustainable. While agreeing
with staff on the need to cap the fiscal cost of subsidies to the sector and
implement reforms over the medium term, they stressed that reform measures
already passed in 2012–13 together with the decision to bring export prices closer to the
marginal cost in 2014 had reestablished the financial position of the electricity sector in the
short term and limited budgetary costs.

B. Policy Theme #2: Reducing Financial Sector Vulnerabilities and
Fostering Financial Deepening
14.
Strengthening the soundness of the banking sector and enhancing its contribution to
the NDP growth objectives.


Strengthening the soundness of the banking sector. While Côte d’Ivoire’s banking sector
is broadly sound,7 public banks (along with a couple of small domestic banks) do not meet
most prudential requirements and are largely undercapitalized.



Deepening financial intermediation. Côte d’Ivoire’s banking system is shallow, with a
private sector credit-to-GDP ratio of about 18 percent and limited access to financial
services (11 percent of the population, including microfinance). Loans are predominantly
short-term and concentrated on larger companies, with limited provision of credit to
medium and small size enterprises. Despite progress in financial deepening, the banking
sector lags relative to peers and several WAEMU countries in terms of depth and access.8
Financial intermediation is weakened by insufficiencies regarding land and property
registries, difficulties faced by creditors when they attempt to recover debts through the
judicial system, and the lack of a widely used borrower’s registry.



To address these issues, a gradual reform program, supported by Fund TA, focuses in
the near-term on eliminating key constraints to private credit and helping banks’
manage liquidity. The authorities have started to reform land registration laws and have
established commercial courts, with the first already operating in Abidjan. They also actively
support reforms undertaken at the regional level by the BCEAO, including the establishment
of a credit bureau by end 2013 and regulations allowing primary dealers to operate. The
latter reform would facilitate the emergence of a secondary market for government
securities and the management of banks’ liquidity. The authorities are formulating a
comprehensive strategy to develop the financial system with the support of the World Bank.
Following financial and strategic audits, the authorities are also working on a restructuring of
the public banks.

Staff’s Views
15.
Strengthening financial sector soundness will require restructuring of the public
banks. While these banks do not represent a systemic risk for the financial system, staff urged the
authorities to act promptly, beginning with those banks for which there is a clear resolution strategy,
drawing on the recommendations of the recent audits and of the September 2013 MCM technical
assistance mission. Staff stressed the importance of minimizing contingent liabilities from these
institutions, while including the full cost of resolution in the budget. 9
16.
Effective implementation of recent reforms and of the financial sector development
strategy should foster financial intermediation. Staff welcomed the recent reforms adopted in
Côte d’Ivoire and at the regional level, and the ongoing preparation of the financial sector
development strategy. The mission urged the authorities to take the lead in the effective
implementation of the recent decision of the BCEAO to allow the creation of primary market dealers
and in the projected establishment of a credit bureau. The mission encouraged the authorities to
create an environment favorable to broadening the financing available for small-and medium-sized
enterprises, while noting that this could be done without necessarily needing public banks.

Authorities’ Views
17.
The authorities agreed with staff views, noting that they
intend to adopt an action plan for resolving the troubled public
banks before end-2013 and that the draft budget incorporates funding
for the bank resolution costs to be incurred during 2014.

MEFP ¶17, ¶36–39

18.
They underscored the key role of the financial sector for promoting strong growth and
indicated that the comprehensive financial sector strategy under preparation will aim at broadening
access to medium-and long-term credit. For this purpose, they are still considering retaining some
public banks to channel credit to specific sectors. To reduce obstacles to deeper financial
intermediation, they plan to gradually extend the operation of commercial courts to outside of
Abidjan and will support the central bank’s regulations regarding primary dealers and credit
bureaus.

C. Policy Theme #3: Maintaining External Stability
19.
Preserving external stability through prudent borrowing and addressing non-price
competitiveness issues


External stability risks are moderate. CGER model-based approaches suggest the real
effective exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals, and in line with the regional

9

Financial sector policies, including banking supervision, are mainly dealt with at the regional level, but resolution is
mainly decided at the domestic level.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CÔTE D’IVOIRE

WAEMU real effective exchange rate assessment.10 The current account deficit is projected to
widen driven by the investment-led growth strategy, with a large part financed through FDI
flows and project loans. Côte d’Ivoire’s external debt profile improved substantially following
HIPC Completion Point in 2012,11 creating scope for new borrowing. The economy and
external stability, however, remain vulnerable to macroeconomic shocks, including lower
exports and GDP growth.


The authorities are finalizing a medium-term debt strategy (MTDS) which aims to
diversify the investor base and lengthen maturities, and are considering issuing a
Eurobond in an amount equivalent to US$500 million in 2014.12 The amount of public
debt held by domestic and regional banks is already sizable (partly because of the forced
restructuring of domestic debt arrears during the 2010–11 post electoral crisis) and its
average maturity is relatively short.13 Diversifying the investor base to include international
markets and lengthening maturities would improve debt management over the medium
term. While the authorities have initiated the process of getting a sovereign rating, they do
not see a rating as a precondition for the Eurobond.



Further strengthening external stability will require significant improvements in
non-price competitiveness indicators. Several indicators measuring the business
environment (including the World Bank’s Doing Business, the Global Competitiveness Index,
and Global Enabling Trade Index) rank Côte d’Ivoire relatively poorly. Difficulties in accessing
financing, corruption, inadequate infrastructure, and legal uncertainty are among the main
factors contributing to this ranking.



To strengthen competitiveness, the authorities have implemented several measures to
improve the business climate. A new investment code was approved in June 2012, and the
electricity and mining codes are being finalized. Substantial progress has been made in
reducing the obstacles to doing business through several measures, including the
establishment of a center for promoting investments (Centre de Promotion des
Investissements en Côte d’Ivoire) that provides a one-stop facility for investors, measures to
reduce the cost and time required to open up a business; and the creation of a commercial
court in Abidjan. Another one-stop facility designed to streamline import procedures is also
being planned.

10

See background note in appendix and the WAEMU Staff Report (IMF Country Report No. 13/92).

11

External debt declined from 54.9 percent of GDP in 2011 to 30.5 percent in 2012.

12

This issuance would not result in additional budget spending. The authorities would reduce borrowing on the
regional market in 2014 by a similar amount, and could use some of the borrowing space to issue government
securities to finance a more rapid retirement of domestic arrears in cash (as opposed to issuing IOUs).
13

Most of the sovereign debt issued on the regional market has a relatively short maturity: most of the securities
issued have a 2–3 year maximum maturity, although some bonds carry a 5-year maturity.

CÔTE D’IVOIRE

Staff’s Views
20.
A medium-term debt strategy that focuses on debt sustainability
MEFP ¶17, ¶40
and high quality projects will be critical for maintaining external stability.
Staff welcomed the preparation of the medium-term debt strategy to better
guide financing decisions and ensure prudent borrowing. The mission noted that replacing regional
financing with a Eurobond would leave unchanged Côte d’Ivoire’s risk of debt distress, and would
contribute to broadening the investor base and lengthening maturities. It also noted, however, that
the issuance should only take place if offered rates are reasonable. The staff recommended that
Côte d’Ivoire wait until it has obtained a sovereign rating since such a rating secures greater access
to capital markets, particularly with respect to institutional investors, and better rates.
21.
Further significant improvements in the business climate will be needed to strengthen
competitiveness and encourage strong private investment. Staff noted that recent
improvements to the business climate have not yet been fully taken into account by the
competitiveness rankings, with some rankings still based on 2010–11 data. However, even after
taking into account the full impact of the recent reforms, significant bottlenecks would remain and
much needs to be done to improve the business climate, the effectiveness of the rule of law,
governance and anti-corruption efforts to encourage the amount of private investment needed in
the years ahead.

Authorities’ Views
22.
The authorities believed the proposed Eurobond would improve
MEFP ¶41
medium-term debt management and partially address their difficulties in
mobilizing longer term financing. The authorities noted that the final decision
on the Eurobond issuance will depend on the foreseeable market yield, in particular taking into
account the foreseen unwinding of unconventional monetary policies in the US.14
23.
The authorities underscored that the ranking of Côte d’Ivoire in the
2014 Doing Business report had improved as a result of their reform efforts.15
MEFP Box 1
They acknowledged the need for further progress in this area, and reiterated their
commitment to continue introducing reforms, consistent with the NDP’s objective of creating one of
the best business climates in Africa.

14

Given uncertainties on the Eurobond issuance, the program macroframework is based on the assumption that the
program is financed through a recourse to the regional market (as in 2013); in case of issuance, a program adjustor
would revise upward the ceiling of nonconcessional debt (by US$500 million) and downward the ceiling on net
domestic financing (by an equivalent amount) ensuring that the fiscal stance would remain the same with or without
the Eurobond issuance and that the proceeds of the issuance are used for asset-liability management.

15

According to IFC, Côte d’Ivoire is “among the economies improving the most in 2012/13 in areas tracked by Doing
th
rd
Business.” Its ranking in the 2014 Doing Business Report is 167 (from 173 in the 2013 report).

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CÔTE D’IVOIRE

D. Policy Theme #4: Enhancing Governance
24.
The authorities have passed legislation to strengthen governance but
MEFP ¶47, ¶48
decisive action is needed. Despite recent improvements,16 Côte d’Ivoire’s ratings
in various governance indices (including the World Bank’s Worldwide Governance
Indicators and the Economic Freedom Index of the Heritage Foundation) remain poor. The
government has reiterated its intention to improve governance and emphasized that two ordinances
have been adopted in September 2013: one aimed at improving the legal framework to prevent and
fight corruption, while the other established the High Authority for Good Governance, the Haute
Autorité pour la Bonne Gouvernance. The country also became EITI compliant in May 2013.
Nonetheless, the amount of public procurement granted on a non-competitive basis reached about
80 percent in the first semester of 2013.

Staff’s Views
25.
Staff welcomed the governance improvements and urged the government to take
further action in this area. The recent legislation designed to reduce corruption and grant special
protection to whistle blowers denouncing corruption signals important progress. However, its
potential positive impact on private sector investors will only materialize if enforcement is forceful.
Staff also highlighted the need to significantly reduce the amount of public procurement granted on
a non-competitive basis, and urged that both the spirit and the letter of the procurement code be
applied effectively.

Authorities’ Views
26.
The authorities indicated that they intend to reduce the
MEFP ¶17, ¶¶47, 48
share of non-competitive public sector contracts and to grant
most of them on a competitive basis. They noted that the council
of ministers had adopted a measure aimed at reducing the share of
non-competitive contracts and enhancing transparency. They indicated, however, that in some cases
they were compelled to award contracts on a non-competitive basis owing to the importance of
moving fast on specific key projects. In other cases, because of the limited availability of large-scale
concessional financing for projects, rather than stall indefinitely key projects, they had agreed to
loans notwithstanding that they were tied to pre-selected companies.

16

The recently published 2013 Ibrahim Index of African Governance (IIAG) shows that Côte d’Ivoire has made
governance improvements, although its score remains below the continental and regional averages.

PROGRAM ISSUES
A. 2013
27.
Fiscal performance was good through end-June 2013. All
MEFP ¶¶7, 10, T1
performance criteria and indicative targets at end-June were met. Revenue
slightly exceeded the program target despite VAT and import taxes
shortfalls owing mostly to the higher-than-anticipated cost of exemptions under
the new investment code adopted in 2012. Expenditures fell below the programmed objective, with
externally-financed investment exceeding its target and domestically-financed investment executed
at a slower pace.
28.
The fiscal position for 2013 is expected to improve more than
projected. The primary basic deficit is projected to decline from
MEFP ¶13–15
0.3 percent of GDP to 0.2 percent of GDP, while the overall deficit would
decrease from 3.2 percent of GDP to 2.7 percent of GDP. This is largely due to
a downward revision of public investment. As noted above, the cash position at end-December is
expected to be tight but manageable, reflecting the large amount of domestic debt redemptions
falling due as a result of the end-2011 restructuring of the outstanding stock of T-bills into 2-year
T-bills, and 3- and 5-year bonds.
29.
Satisfactory structural reform progress has been made so far,
but decisive actions are needed to complete reforms in some key
MEFP ¶11, T2
areas. Ten out of 14 structural benchmarks were met through
end-October (MEFP Table 2). In particular, progress was made to improve
public financial management, with the adoption by the Council of Ministers of the organic laws for
fiscal transparency and the budget system law transposing the WAEMU directives; the
medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF 2014–16) was also attached to the budget
documentation for 2014. A new electricity code was also adopted by the Council of ministers and is
awaiting its transmission to the National assembly. However, although considerable progress was
made in: (i) drawing up a medium-term strategy for controlling the wage bill; (ii) elaborating a
medium-term debt strategy; (iii) finalizing a new mining code; and (iv) preparing an action plan for
restructuring public banks (financial and strategic audits have been completed) and another one for
regularizing domestic arrears (the arrears have been audited),17 delays were encountered in
completing these reforms by their due date.
17

The second wave of audits of domestic arrears to suppliers was completed in October 2013. It validated the
amount of arrears owned to several thousand creditors: CFAF 152.9 billion (1.1 percent of GDP); the initial amount of
arrears to suppliers in the treasury books (before the two waves of audits) stood at CFAF 356 billion (i.e., the audits
resulted in 57.1 percent of these arrears being rejected). On November 22, 2013, the Council of Ministers approved a
communication detailing the next steps: the government will, by the end of 2013, pay an amount in cash to all
creditors which would allow the settlement of the debt owed to small creditors; the remaining outstanding arrears
will, depending of the choice of the creditor, be paid off as follows: (i) option 1: in cash in early 2014 (with a

(continued)

CÔTE D’IVOIRE

30.
The authorities are committed to stepping up efforts to complete
MEFP ¶17
the planned reforms. This includes, in particular, the adoption of the
medium-term wage bill strategy, the reorganization of the debt management
unit along functional lines (front-, middle-, back-office), the regularization of
domestic arrears to suppliers in line with the action plan expected to be adopted in November 2013,
the restructuring of public banks, and the adoption of a financial sector development strategy.

B. 2014
31.
The draft 2014 budget is built on a conservative macroeconomic
MEFP ¶26–31
scenario and prudent revenue projections. Overall, total tax revenue is
projected to remain stable in percentage of GDP relative to its 2013 level. The
projected reduction in cocoa revenue, which reflects an expected lower production, would be offset
by the good performance of direct and indirect taxes. The government has included specific fiscal
measures in the draft 2014 budget to enhance revenue collection. These include, in particular,
removing two VAT exemptions, raising the tax rate on the telecommunication sector, aligning the
rate of the tax on capital gains with the WAEMU norm, and raising excise taxes on beverages and
tobacco. Grants from France, in the context of the debt-for-development swap mechanism (C2D),
and from other development partners are expected to rise to 2.4 percent of GDP in 2014 from
1.7 percent of GDP in 2013. In total, revenue and grants are projected to increase from 21.3 percent
of GDP in 2013 to 22 percent of GDP in 2014.
32.
The authorities are committed to containing current expenditure to allow capital
spending to continue growing in 2014. In spite of a higher wage bill (+0.2 percent of GDP),
current expenditures are expected to decline by 0.1 percent of GDP owing to a reduction in
spending on subsidies, stemming from the government’s decision to bill some electricity exports at
the marginal cost of production in 2014. The wage bill would increase to deliver on promises made
by the previous regimes; in addition, step increases which had been frozen for many years would
start being implemented with retroactive effects spread over the medium term. Capital expenditure
would continue to increase (+0.5 percent of GDP), focused on infrastructure projects in energy and
roads, in line with the National Development Plan.
33.
Overall, the fiscal adjustment would continue in 2014. The primary basic deficit would
edge down to 0.1 percent of GDP in 2014 from 0.2 percent in 2013, while the overall fiscal deficit
would decline from 2.7 percent of GDP in 2013 to 2.3 percent in 2014. The deficit would be financed
by a net mobilization of funds in the regional market (2.3 percent of GDP in 2014 against 2.4 percent
in 2013), and net external financing (0.4 percent of GDP in 2014 against 0.7 percent in 2013). The
50 percent reduction of the amount due); (ii) option 2: over three years (30 percent reduction); or (iii) option 3: over
5 years (20 percent reduction). As of end-September 2013, the planned reduction of domestic arrears and debt float
foreseen under the 2013 program (CFAF 50 billion) was on track.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21

CÔTE D’IVOIRE

somewhat tighter fiscal stance in 2014 reflects: (i) conservative assumptions on the volume of new
net additional financing available in the regional market; and (ii) the authorities’ prudent decision to
build the budget on a solid basis by only including already-committed external loans. If additional
resources were to become available, a supplementary budget would be considered.
34.
As regards new structural reforms, the authorities intend to take further actions to
improve public financial management. A consolidated commitment and procurement plan is
being prepared to smooth cash management. A stocktaking of various government and public
entity accounts in commercial banks and at the BCEAO is planned with a view to setting up a
Treasury Single Account. In addition, the government will evaluate the expenditure process and
adopt corrective measures to reinforce controls, eliminate exceptional spending procedures, and
limit the recourse to cash advances.
35.
The authorities have requested an increase in an amount
equivalent to US$500 million in the program’s ceiling for 2014 on new
MEFP ¶41
nonconcessional external debt to accommodate the issuance of a new
Eurobond.18The Eurobond would permit restructuring the government’s debt
liabilities, notably by lengthening maturities, and widen Côte d’Ivoire’s presence on international
markets. Staff supports this request while emphasizing that the decision on whether to issue a bond
should take into account the implications for overall debt service costs and the need to avoid too
high a concentration of external maturities in a relatively short period in the mid-2020s.
Côte d’Ivoire’s risk of debt distress would remain at a moderate level (see DSA).
36.
Program criteria (PC) will remain unchanged and staff supports the proposed set of
quantitative PCs for end-June 2014. The definitions of the variable monitored are provided in the
Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU). Structural benchmarks are proposed as shown in
the MEFP, Table 2. The new SBs, covering the period through November 2014, focus on public
financial management.

STAFF APPRAISAL
37.
Côte d’Ivoire has achieved considerable progress over the last two years. Under the
authorities’ program, Côte d’Ivoire is experiencing a strong recovery. The implementation of a
number of structural reforms and the surge in public investment, coupled with prudent fiscal policy,
have resulted in the removal of infrastructure bottlenecks and improvements in the business climate
while boosting demand. These policies have been conducive to sustained high growth, while
inflation has remained low.

18

For the end-June 2014 PCs being set at this review, the ceiling on new nonconcessional external debt is being
raised by US$100 million (from US$800 million at end-December 2013 to US$900 million at end-June 2014). This
ceiling, as well as the ceiling on net domestic financing, will be further adjusted at the time the Eurobond is issued
(see MEFP Table 1, footnote 5).

22

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CÔTE D’IVOIRE

38.
The government’s policies should result in inclusive growth and tangible
improvements in living standards. Strong growth associated with a high level of pro-poor
spending, and structural reforms leading to higher incomes for some groups of farmers, such as in
the cocoa sector, should increase jobs and income, raise living standards, and improve access to
public services to a wide range of the population.
39.
Provided the reform momentum is sustained, the medium-term outlook is positive
with continued robust growth and a stable macroeconomic environment. Preliminary
indications in 2013 that private sector confidence has increased and that crowding in of private
investment is taking place augurs well for the authorities’ capacity to achieve sustained growth over
the medium term while keeping inflation low. Nevertheless, reaching the authorities’ ambitious
targets of high growth and poverty reduction will require further reform efforts. At the same time,
this medium-term outlook is vulnerable to a significant downside risk: if the foreseen high growth
rates do not materialize, it would be important for the authorities to take corrective measures to
safeguard fiscal and macroeconomic stability and to strengthen sustainable growth dynamics.
40.
Strengthening fiscal sustainability over the medium term and increasing the fiscal
space for infrastructure and social spending will require further reforms. The government
should enhance revenue mobilization through additional tax policy and administration reform, and
curtail widespread exemptions. The staff welcomes the government’s commitment to further
strengthen public financial management including through a reform of exceptional spending
procedures; it urges it to significantly strengthen cash management and cash planning to better
manage the bunching of domestic debt payments toward the end of the year. There is also a need
to put the electricity sector on a sound financial footing and contain budget subsidies to it.
41.
Developing the financial sector will contribute to strong and inclusive growth, through
greater financing options for medium-and small companies and broader access to financial
services for a larger share of the population. Staff welcomes the authorities’ intent to adopt a
financial sector reform strategy and urges them to begin implementation as soon as possible. It is
encouraged by the progress made in preparing options for the restructuring of public banks and the
authorities’ planned adoption of an action plan by end-November 2013; it recommends rapid
implementation of the first steps of this plan.
42.
Preserving external stability will require continued prudent borrowing—largely on
concessional terms. Prudent borrowing policies are in particular necessary to avoid any
deterioration in Côte d’Ivoire’s moderate risk of debt distress. In this regard, staff welcomes the
medium-term debt strategy that the authorities plan to adopt by end-November and the
reinforcement of debt management capacity. Staff supports the authorities’ consideration of a
Eurobond issue aimed at improving asset-liability management, while noting that this decision
should weigh the implications for overall debt service costs and the need to avoid an excessive
concentration of maturities. Staff also urges the authorities to obtain a sovereign rating as a first
step, to help obtain the best issuance terms.

43.
Further measures to improve the business climate and governance are needed to
provide a favorable environment for strong private sector investment. The authorities have
made important progress in strengthening the business environment, as demonstrated by the
recent improvement in Côte d’Ivoire ratings in the 2014 Doing Business report, and in strengthening
the legal framework to prevent and fight corruption. Further enhancements in governance and in
the business climate, aimed in particular at enforcing the rule of law, will be key for attracting
significant FDI and domestic private investment. Staff urges the authorities to significantly reduce
the amount of public procurement granted on a non-competitive basis and to ensure the effective
implementation of the spirit and the letter of the procurement code.
44.
Program performance has been good. All end-June performance criteria and indicative
targets have been met and progress on structural reforms has been solid, although with some
delays and missed structural benchmarks.
45.
Staff recommends completion of the fourth review and a disbursement of an amount
equivalent to SDR 48.78 million under the ECF arrangement. It supports the authorities’ request
for raising the ceiling for new nonconcessional external debt and the proposed performance criteria
for end-June 2014. It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation take place in accordance with
the Decision on Article IV consultation cycles for program countries (Decision No. 14747-(10/96), as
amended).

Box 2. Côte d’Ivoire: High-Growth in Non-Natural Resource Producing
African Countries
Côte d’Ivoire will need to implement a comprehensive reform strategy to reach the ambitious medium-term
growth and poverty reduction objectives it is targeting over the medium term. In that context, what can it learn
from other African countries that have sustained high growth rates in recent years?
The Regional Economic Outlook analyzes the experience of the six LICs in sub-Saharan Africa—Burkina Faso,
Ethiopia, Mozambique, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda—that experienced the fastest sustained growth
during 1995–2010, although they were not natural resource producers during that time. While these
countries followed different paths, their experience demonstrates that a shift in macroeconomic policy
making, combined with comprehensive structural reforms and sustained external financing can create the
fiscal space to finance productive investment and generate a growth dividend.
The chapter highlights the key points that contributed to this virtuous circle of sustained high growth:
Macroeconomic stability. All countries in the sample show that improved macroeconomic policies, structural
reforms, and a greater degree of overall stability are crucial for economic growth. Greater fiscal
space—reflecting expenditure prioritization and a combination of debt relief, aid, and greater domestic
resource mobilization—can translate into higher levels of social and investment spending, supporting
growth in both the near-and medium term. Lower inflation and a more predictable economic environment
reduce risks and transaction costs, encouraging private sector activity. Improved macroeconomic policies
also help to attract foreign financing, both in the form of foreign aid and private resources, such as FDI.
Effective use of foreign aid. The increased level and predictability of foreign aid enabled a greater focus on
medium-term planning and greater opportunities for alignment with national poverty-reduction strategies.
Strong national policy-making institutions. Identifying and translating increased fiscal space into sustainable
growth requires effective macro policymaking and strong institutions, in particular regarding PFM capacity.
High investment levels. Sustained high investment levels are crucial to increase the capital stock and boost
overall productivity levels. Investment in infrastructure is particularly important, as it promotes private sector
development through lowering overall business costs. The lack of an adequate transport infrastructure can
bar large segments of the population from access to markets, in particular in rural areas, where poverty is
concentrated.
Deeper financial markets. Deeper financial markets support growth by enhancing domestic savings to
finance investment. Financial inclusion has tended to lag, and could—including through use of new
technologies—be prioritized to make the growth process more inclusive.

Appendix I. Côte d’Ivoire—Letter of Intent
Minister at the Prime Minister’s Office
in charge of Economy and Finance
----------------------Office of the Minister
No. 5906 MPMEF/CAB/CT-TK

Republic of Côte d’Ivoire
---------

Abidjan, November 20, 2013
The Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
WASHINGTON DC, 20431

Subject: Letter of intent
Dear Madame Managing Director:

1.
The upturn in economic growth recorded in Côte d’Ivoire in 2012 has been consolidated in
2013 in the context of the country’s normalized social, political, and security conditions. The holding
of free and transparent municipal and regional elections in 2013 has completed the electoral cycle.
National reconciliation and political dialogue is progressing in a generally calmer climate, prompting
the return of a large number of refugees. As regards security, the situation has been normalized over
the entire territory owing notably to actions undertaken by the National Security Council (CNS).
Implementation of the process of disarmament and reintegration of ex-combatants by the
Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration Authority (ADDR) is progressing, while the local
delegations of the Dialogue, Truth and Reconciliation Commission (CDVR) are now working actively
in the regions to consolidate social cohesion.
2.
The attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) describes progress
made to date, the outlook at end-2013, and the policies we will implement in 2014. All the
quantitative criteria and indicative targets included in our economic and financial program
supported by the IMF’s Extended Credit Facility (ECF) were observed at end-June 2013. In
macroeconomic terms, the outcomes already recorded in 2013 are better than expected. End-June
results confirm that the growth target of 9 percent in 2013 is within reach, while the inflation rate is
expected to remain below 3 percent. The basic primary balance and the overall fiscal deficit are
poised to improve faster than expected. The business environment has also improved markedly, in
particular with the implementation of the new investment code and the coming on stream of the
single window for business formalities. Progress has also been noted with regard to the financial
balance of the energy sector.
3.
The year 2014 is expected to confirm the strong economic growth momentum observed
since 2012, in line with the National Development Plan (NDP). The government has set a GDP growth
42

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CÔTE D’IVOIRE

target of 10 percent for 2014, while containing inflation within the community norm of 3 percent. To
achieve this objective, the government expects to reap the benefits of continued progress in
normalizing social, political, and security conditions, as well as of the full effects of the structural
reforms being implemented, in particular, to improve the business climate. The government also
intends to continue its public investment program to crowd in private investment further, in line with
its aim to make the private sector the main driver of economic growth. The new investment code for
the promotion of foreign direct investment (FDI) and the development of SMEs/SMIs, the single
window for business formalities, and public private partnerships (PPPs) for which the institutional
and regulatory framework has been developed will support the government’s efforts to boost
investment. The measures taken to improve the business climate led to an upgrade in Côte d’Ivoire’s
rating in the “2014 Doing Business” report of the World Bank, which is in particular ranking
Côte d’Ivoire among the 10 economies improving the most their business climate in 2012/13.
Further, the government is planning to hold a forum, from January 29 to February 1, 2014, entitled
Doing Business in Côte d’Ivoire 2014/Investir en Côte d’Ivoire: ICI 2014. The forum, which is expected
to attract around 3,000 participants, will provide an opportunity for discussion between national and
international investors in support of the government’s policy objectives.
4.
The government will continue to implement structural reforms with a view to strengthening
the bases of a competitive economy. It also plans to step up the pace of public financial
management reforms by enacting decrees for the draft laws transposing the WAEMU directives into
Côte d’Ivoire’s legislation; these draft laws have already been submitted to the National Assembly.
We will also review the public expenditure chain and take corrective measures to strengthen
verification of the delivery of goods and services, eliminate exceptional payment order procedures,
and limit the use of treasury cash advances. By end-November 2013, we intend to adopt an action
plan to regularize domestic arrears with government suppliers, as well as a medium-term debt
management strategy (MTDS) to safeguard fiscal sustainability. In addition, progress achieved in
implementing the medium-term strategy aimed at restoring financial balance in the electricity sector
will be further consolidated in 2014. The government will also intensify its efforts to develop the
financial sector so as to increase the latter’s contribution to financing the economy. Our objective is
to strengthen the performance and competitiveness of all sectors of the economy.
5.
The government intends to broaden its sources of financing by accessing international
financial markets, including through the issuance of Eurobonds. This initiative, along with obtaining a
sovereign credit rating, forms part of the debt strategy framework. The purpose of issuing
Eurobonds is to broaden our sources of financing as well as improve our debt maturity profile and
assets/liabilities management. More specifically, the government is planning a Eurobond issuance in
2014. In that regard, we are requesting IMF approval to increase the cumulative nonconcessional
lending window by USD 500 million at end-2014. In addition, in keeping with the commitments
undertaken under the economic and financial program, the government will continue to seek loans
on concessional terms, including for major infrastructure projects.

CÔTE D’IVOIRE

6.
The government reaffirms its intention to reduce poverty significantly and is committed to
implementing the NDP with a view to making Côte d’Ivoire an emerging country with solid
fundamentals by 2020. In that context, the government will continue to prioritize and implement
transformational projects that contribute to improving access to employment for young people.
Actions already underway include implementation of the youth employment and skills development
project, PEJEDEC, and strengthening the resources of the FAFCI, a fund created in 2012 to support
the women of Côte d’Ivoire by helping them access microcredit at low interest rates. The
government has also launched a vast food crop production recovery program aimed at creating
youth employment in rural areas and achieving food self-sufficiency by 2016. In addition, various
investment programs have been initiated to improve the quality of life in rural areas. Rural roads are
being renovated and cocoa and coffee producers are effectively receiving 60 percent of the CIF price
through a program of forward sales based on averaged prices. This process aimed at improving the
management of major cash crops will continue to be implemented in the cotton and cashew sectors.
Civil service staffing levels in the health and education sectors are being strengthened in the context
of a strategy that provides for containment of the wage bill over the medium term.
7.
The government of Côte d’Ivoire is convinced that the policies and measures included in the
MEFP are sufficient to achieve its objectives. However, the government will take any additional
measure that it may deem necessary to this end. The government will consult with the Fund staff
before adopting such measures, or in the event of changes to the policies set out in this
memorandum. The government agrees to provide any information that the Fund may request to
monitor progress in the implementation of economic policies and the achievement of program
objectives.
8.
We ask the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to provide financial support to the
government under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) in an amount equivalent to SDR 48.78 million.
9.
The Ivoirien authorities consent to the release of this Letter of Intent, and the attached
Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) and Technical Memorandum of
Understanding (TMU), as well as the IMF staff report on the review of the ECF-supported program.
We hereby authorize their publication and posting on the IMF website after approval of the review
of the program by the IMF Executive Board.
Very truly yours,

Attachment I. Côte d’Ivoire: Memorandum of Economic and
Financial Policies
November 20, 2013

Context
Côte d’Ivoire is consolidating its economic recovery in the context of normalized,
social, political and security conditions. The holding of free and transparent municipal and
regional elections in 2013 has completed the electoral cycle. . National reconciliation and political
dialogue is progressing in a generally calmer climate, prompting the return of a large number of
refugees. As regards security, the situation has been normalized over the entire territory.1 This has
been achieved as a result of the action of the National Security Council (CNS), the permanent entity
for analysis and policy development involving the highest government authorities, and is part of the
overall reform of the security sector. Measures adopted in this area include capacity-building for the
security services (equipment and training), creation of specialized units to combat racketeering and
restore security, and a video protection program for the city of Abidjan. The process for the
disarmament and reintegration of former combatants by the Disarmament, Demobilization, and
Reintegration Authority (ADDR) is making headway. In addition, the local delegations of the
Dialogue, Truth, and Reconciliation Commission (CDVR) are working in the regions to consolidate
social cohesion.
1.

A response has been made to some of the key issues at the center of the people’s
concerns for several years. In fact, in August 2013 the National Assembly adopted two laws on
nationality and rural property. These laws clarify the conditions and procedures for access to Ivoirian
nationality and rural property, and should help strengthen social unity.
2.

As to the economic situation, the impact of the implementation of the National
Development Plan (2012–15) has confirmed a sharp upswing in economic activity. In 2012, the
GDP growth rate reached 9.8 percent, placing Côte d’Ivoire among the countries with the strongest
growth rates in the world. In 2013, based on the results from the first half of the year we expect to
achieve a 9 percent growth rate while the inflation rate is projected at 2.7 percent. All of the
quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets for end-June 2013 for our economic and
financial program supported by the IMF’s Extended Credit Facility have been met, thanks to
continued efforts to rationalize the management of public finances. The business climate has
considerably improved, with the implementation of a new investment code, the startup of a
one-stop facility for investments, and a reduction of the fiscal costs for creating a business and

2.45 for the same period in 2012. The United Nations Index went from 5 in April 2011 to 1.6 in May 2013, on a scale

obtaining real estate. These efforts have been reflected in a significant increase in new businesses
(1,095 in the first half of 2013, compared with 396 during the same period in 2013), and in private
investment. These major reforms have been recognized in the World Bank’s report, “Doing Business
in 2014”, which ranks Cȏte d’Ivoire amongst the 10 countries in the world that have made the
greatest improvement.
In line with the objectives of the PND, the 2014 economic and financial program will
focus in particular on consolidating macroeconomic stability and pursuing reforms designed
to improve public financial management and combating poverty. To achieve its 10 percent
growth target on average for 2014 and 2015, the government is working to strengthen the
implementation of transformational investment projects and to mobilize the financing announced by
donors during the meeting of the Consultative Group in December 2012 in Paris. The ratio of
investment to GDP should rise from 13.7 percent in 2012 to 17.8 percent in 2013 and 19.6 percent in
2014, and the ratio for public investment from to 4.9 percent, to 7.2 percent and 8.2 percent,
respectively. The government also intends to accelerate the restructuring of public banks, restore the
financial viability of the electricity sector, strengthen public financial management, especially debt
management, deepen tax policy reforms, modernize the government administration, and rehabilitate
and develop the financial sector. Furthermore, the government is determined to strengthen
subregional integration.

4.

This memorandum updates the 2011–14 three-year economic and financial program, supported by
the Extended Credit Facility, of which the objectives are to stabilize the macroeconomic framework
and improve public financial management.

Economic Developments and Implementation of the Program for the
First Half of 2013
A.

Recent Economic Developments

At end-June 2013, economic activity in most sectors is well-placed thanks to the
increased sociopolitical stability and the implementation of the principal PND projects.
5.



Economic activity continues to expand, with good performance in the tertiary sector,
especially in retail trade (+14.8 percent), industrial production, mainly linked to a resurgence
of activity in the food and beverage industries (+5.7 percent), furniture and miscellaneous
products (+44.2 percent), and electricity, gas, and heating (+17.3 percent). Despite the halt in
bitumen production due to maintenance of the factories, which contributed to a 14.2 percent
drop in the leading indicator for construction and public works, the dynamism of this sector
is reflected in a 69.4 percent increase in national sales of concrete, a 42.7 percent rise in
sheet metal sales, and a 23.7 percent rise in sales of gravel.



Average annual inflation was 3.5 percent at end-June, due to the higher costs of
“education, and clothing and footwear,” as well as certain food products, such as fresh

46

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CÔTE D’IVOIRE

vegetables. However, the inflation rate has slowed down since April, and reached
2.9 percent year-on-year in June 2013.


Exports were up by 15.8 percent, mainly driven by the 20.8 percent increase in
manufactured products and a good performance in primary products (cocoa beans
(+39.6 percent)), and cashew nuts (12.3 percent). Imports grew by 4.1 percent, due to the
combined effect of a substantial increase in capital goods (+24.6 percent), almost stable
consumer goods (+0.6 percent), and a decline in intermediate goods -3.2 percent.



With regard to the monetary developments, medium- and long-term credit increased by
5.8 percent compared to end-December 2012, reflecting enhanced private sector
participation in the economic recovery. In addition, new credits are up by 9.9 percent over
the same period in 2012.



Employment in the formal sector has also increased (+2.8 percent at end June 2013) since
the start of the year, especially in the private sector.



On the stock market, capitalization of shares on the Regional Stock Exchange (BRVM) rose
to an historic level of CFAF 6,116.5 billion in the first half of 2013. This strong performance
reflects the confidence of regional and international investors, due to the improved
economic prospects of the WAEMU and the strong growth potential of the companies listed
on the exchange. The BRVM shifted from a price fixing system to continuous trading on
September 16.

Measures taken by the government to boost activity have enhanced the confidence of
the private sector. This confidence is reflected in the creation of new businesses, especially in the
construction and public works sector (cement factories); food products (breweries, rice processing
plants), services (financial institutions), and extractive industries; as well as in a show of interest in
public-private partnerships (PPP). The private sector investment rate increased from 8.8 percent of
GDP in 2012 to 10.3 percent of GDP in 2013.
6.

7.

Budget execution at end-June 2013 was satisfactory.



Budget revenue exceeded the objective by CFAF 23.3 billion, on account of the performance
of the profit tax (BIC) (excluding petroleum), the personal income and wage tax, stamp and
registration taxes, and export taxes. The good revenue performance made it possible to limit
the impact of shortfalls recorded in collection of the VAT and import taxes on general
merchandise.



Inflows from external loans and project grants were higher than expected reflecting a good
level of mobilization, as a result of drawings made primarily on World Bank loans financing
projects related to employment and for improvements in economic infrastructure.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

47

CÔTE D’IVOIRE



Total expenditures were lower than targeted. For current expenditures, the wage bill was
executed within the expected allocation. The subsidy to the electricity sector turned out to be
CFAF 43.1 billion as compared to the planned CFAF 15.3 billion, because the discussions on
the selling price of gas from the CI 26 field had not yet been completed. However, good
rainfall reduced the need for recourse to heavy vacuum oil (HVO). Investment expenditures
amounted to CFAF 419 billion, representing an 86.9 percent execution rate in comparison with
the end-June 2013 target. In terms of the annual objective, they represent 38.4 percent in
2013, as compared to 30.3 percent in 2012. Externally funded expenditure was
CFAF 219.2 billion, or 49.8 percent of annual allocations. Domestically funded capital
expenditure amounted to CFAF 201.8 billion, as compared to the expected CFAF 347.9 billion
at end-June 2013, representing a 58 percent execution rate. This outcome is attributable to
delays in implementing certain projects, in particular those planned in the context of C2D.

The fight against poverty remains a priority. The Government has strengthened national
job-promotion structures, including the Agency for Employment Studies and Promotion (AGEPE),
through schemes for training and placing young unemployed graduates, such as the Youth Job and
Skill Development Project (PEJEDEC), which is now operational. The Women’s Support Fund of
Côte d’Ivoire (FAFCI), established in 2012, has been allocated a budget of CFAF one billion, to
facilitate access to micro-credit with reduced rate (1% per month). The return of a price-guarantee
system has increased the remuneration of cocoa producers (about 700,000) and coffee producers,
who are now receiving a farm-gate price equivalent to 60 percent of the CIF price. Through 2020,
civil service recruitment will focus primarily on the education and health sectors, as well as on
security. Draft legislation to introduce universal health insurance (CMU) has been prepared and
submitted to the Council of Government. The construction and equipping of classrooms and health
centers also remains a government priority. In this respect, the policy of “free schooling for all” has
been maintained to increase access of children to education. Finally, apart from the major
construction projects to build a third bridge and extend the highway to the North, the government
has instructed the Coffee and Cocoa Council to renovate rural roads. This decision will permit all the
stakeholders in this leading sector of the economy to share in the improvement in rural living
conditions.
8.

As regards financing, the government has made recourse to the sub-regional monetary
and financial market, in the amount of CFAF 321 billion, as compared to the expected
CFAF 324.3 billion. In terms of the annual objective, this amount represents 39.8 percent of
expected domestic financing. External financing was CFAF 309.8 billion, of which grants
(CFAF 132.9 billion), borrowing (CFAF 140.3 billion), and budget support (CFAF 36.6 billion).
9.

B.

Implementation of the Program

Good budget execution during the first half of 2013 enabled the government to
observe all performance criteria and indicative targets of the economic and financial program.
The primary basic balance recorded a surplus of CFAF 116.3 billion, as compared to the programmed
deficit of CFAF 55.5 billion. The government has not only accumulated no new external and internal
10.

48

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CÔTE D’IVOIRE

arrears, but also it has made an effort to reduce net amounts payable by CFAF 88.3 billion, as
compared to the target minimum of CFAF 10 billion, to lower the high level of floating debt at the
end of 2012. In addition, the government has been pursuing its anti-poverty efforts. Thus,
“pro-poor” expenditures amounted to CFAF 590.5 billion, as compared to the target minimum of
CFAF 588.8 billion. The level of budget advances excluding debt, revenue-collecting agencies
(régies), and personnel, was posted at CFAF 52.8 billion, in comparison with the CFAF 59 billion
ceiling.
In the process of consolidating a sustainable economic recovery a range of structural
reforms were implemented through end-June in the context of the program. The principal
measures were as follows:
11.



Two proposed organic laws based on the WAEMU directives of 2009 related to the
transparency code and the budget law were adopted by the Council of Ministers on
June 6, 2013;



A new pricing mechanism for petroleum products was adopted in November 2012 and
implemented as of April 2013. The new mechanism includes a refining fee to support the
Ivoirien Refining Corporation (Société Ivoirienne de Raffinage, SIR). In addition, the
government’s outstanding debt vis-à-vis SIR at end-2012 was the subject of a securitization
agreement in June 2013;



Government efforts to improve the transparency of the extractive industries sector have
enabled Côte d’Ivoire to be in compliance with the Extractive Industries Transparency
Initiative (EITI) since May 2013. EITI reports for 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011 were published
and forwarded to EITI International;



Implementation of the medium-term strategy for restoring the equilibrium of the electricity
sector adopted in November 2012 produced the following results: (i) the remuneration of
the concessionaire was revised downward and an agreement was obtained on its support for
the sector for the period 2013–15; (ii) the rate of collection of bills in the central-north-west
(CNO) zones increased from 40 percent in 2012 to 60 percent at end-June 2013; and

Box 1. Côte d’Ivoire: A Business Climate Propitious for Investment
The objective is for Côte d’Ivoire to become an emerging market economy by 2020. This choice is
firmly based on a policy to stimulate private investment as the engine for economic growth and
recovery and cannot succeed without an improvement in the business climate.
To achieve this, Côte d’Ivoire has embarked on a process of reforms relating in particular to six of the
“Doing Business” indicators this year, and four more in 2014. The six indicators concern the creation of
companies, property transfer, cross-border trade, tax payment, building permits, and the execution of
contracts. An institutional arrangement devoted exclusively to the business climate was created. This
arrangement, based on best practices in Africa and throughout the world, was placed under the
authority of the Prime Minister and head of government. The following steps have been taken under
this initiative:



Decree No. 2012-867 of September 6, 2012 establishing the Investment Promotion Center in
Côte d’Ivoire (CEPICI) as the single port of entry for investment in Côte d’Ivoire. The same
decree defines several windows, including the “One-Stop Shop for Business Procedures,” now
in operation, which makes it possible to complete all of the formalities involved in establishing
and opening a business within the space of 48 hours.



The operator of the one-stop window for foreign trade (GUCE) started activities on
July 1, 2013. When finalized the GUCE will permit the simplification of formalities for
importing goods and provide a response to WTO concerns in the area of trade facilitation. Its
advantages are that it simplifies and standardizes trade procedures, shortens the time
involved, reduces costs related to procedures, and increases the competitiveness of the
private sector. In addition, it will make it possible to obtain quality data on trade in real time,
help strengthen governance and transparency in foreign trade, and improve the position of
the country in international indices..



The new investment code was adopted by order No. 2012-487 of June 7, 2012. It has
attractive tax features, and provisions for strengthened guarantees and protection, in keeping
with best international standards on the subject.



The institutional and legal framework governing PPPs is in place. In this regard, a national
committee was set up , and has identified over 60 priority projects, several of which are
already being implemented.



In the area of judicial reform, the following steps have been taken, among others: (i) In
February 2012, adoption by the Council of Ministers of an order of exequatur with regard to
arbitration courts decisions determining the intervention of national jurisdictions in arbitration
proceedings; and (ii) Ivoirien law was brought into conformity with provisions in international
law regarding anti-corruption and illicit enrichment.



The first Commercial Court of Côte d’Ivoire began operating in October 2012, and is handing
down decisions within a maximum of 90 days.

All of these measures have resulted in the improvement of Côte d’Ivoire’s rank in the World Bank’s
“Doing Business 2014” classification, which rates Côte d’Ivoire among the 10 countries in the world
that have made the most progress this year in improving their business climate.

Economic Prospects for End-2013

12.

Macroeconomic prospects confirm the strong growth of activity in 2013.



The GDP growth rate in 2013 is estimated at 9 percent, thanks to the vitality of all sectors.



The slowdown observed in prices since April 2013 should make it possible to bring the
average annual inflation rate down to 2.7 percent by the end of the year.



The trade balance should remain in surplus, despite the continued rise in imports linked to
public and private investment. In fact, imports are expected to grow by 13.8 percent, owing
mainly to capital goods. As for exports, they would rise by 10.9 percent, with an increase in
sales of petroleum, crude oil, palm oil, and agrofood and manufacturing products. The
current account balance will remain in deficit, while the balance of payments should register
a surplus.

Budget revenue (CFAF 2,766.7 billion) will be in line with the objective
(CFAF 2,764.5 billion), despite the drop in indirect taxes and import duties. With the upturn in
economic activity, the objectives for some revenues were revised upward, especially for the BIC,
taxes on petroleum products, and export taxes. However, based on the end-July 2013 data for
revenues, collection of the VAT and import tax on general merchandise could be below initial
projections, owing to a higher-than-projected rise in capital goods imports benefiting from
exemptions under the investment code. Similarly, VAT receipts would be CFAF 230.6 billion
compared to the CFAF 245 billion target. Specific measures have been adopted to optimize the
potential of these taxes. They include tightening the various types of control namely, an increased
effort to collect tax arrears, the systematic monitoring of the VAT statements showing a credit, a
review of the criteria for selecting products subject to controls, and an increase in the valuation of
imported goods thanks to the new operator, which will lead to increased revenue.
13.

Expenditures (CFAF 3,384.4 billion) will be broadly in line with the objective
(CFAF 3,445.3 billion). However, the subsidy to the electricity sector would be CFAF 63.2 billion
compared to the CFAF 32.3 billion objective, as a result of the continued negotiations on the selling
price of gas from block CI 26. In addition, investment expenditures should post an execution rate of
the program objective of 92 percent, despite the fact that implementation of C2D projects was
weaker than expected.
14.

Financing needs for 2013 should be covered. They amount to CFAF 382 billion, or
2.7 percent of GDP compared with the goal of CFAF 53.3 billion. As projected, these needs will be
financed primarily by a net mobilization of resources on the regional financial market (WAEMU), and
by external resources of multilateral institutions and bilateral lenders. More specifically, important
contractual debts falling due at end 2013 will be financed by recourse to the regional financial
market and by mobilizing of domestic resources.
15.

The government is planning to partially use the nonconcessional lending window
capped at a ceiling of USD 800 million in 2013. To implement the vast investment program under
the PND, nonconcessional loan agreements were signed for a total of USD 680 million. The amount
of loans that met have become effective is USD 500 million, for financing the Soubré hydroelectric
power plant project.

16.

The progress expected in the area of structural reforms over the remainder of 2013 is
summed up as follows:

17.



The proposed law on the customs code and the draft decree on the procedural manual for
customs inquiries were approved during a workshop in July 2013. Adoption of the manual of
procedures depends on passage of the proposed customs code, which has been submitted
to the Council of Ministers for consideration, and will then be forwarded to the National
Assembly.



A standard public procurement plan is being prepared, and will be disseminated among
appropriations managers at the outset of 2014 budget execution. An expenditure
commitment plan will also be available before end-January 2014. Work on that plan will
begin as soon as the proposed budget is adopted by the Council of Ministers.



The proposed Medium-Term Debt Management Strategy (2013–15, MTDS) in line with
international standards will be adopted by the Council of Ministers at end-November 2013.
The MDTS will be made consistent with the Debt Sustainability Analysis that was updated at
end-October 2013, with IMF technical assistance.



A debt management structure incorporating a front office, middle office, and back office will
be put in place before end-December 2013. A draft staff organizational chart based on this
new structure is being finalized and will be implemented in 2014.



Domestic Treasury arrears on amounts owed to suppliers at end-2010 were audited, to get a
better understanding of the debt submitted for settlement. Based on the results, a plan for
settling these domestic arrears will be adopted by end-November 2013. The audit was done
in two main stages. The first stage consisted of examining the Treasury’s payables for
validation, on the basis of the vouchers produced for the various transactions. The payments
due from this stage amounted to CFAF 356.7 billion. At the end of the audit procedure, the
auditors found that CFAF 142.1 billion was irregular, and proposed that it be rejected, and
that CFAF 192.2 billion be approved. A second audit was initiated on payables validated
during the first audit. This second audit went beyond an evaluation of the accounts, to
determine whether the services were actually performed and to assess the cost of the work
involved.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CÔTE D’IVOIRE



A bill introducing universal health coverage (CMU) is being prepared. This law will guarantee
access to health care for the most vulnerable sectors of the population based on principles
of national solidarity, equity, and risk-sharing.



A bill on the labor code is under preparation. This new bill is designed to provide better
protection against job insecurity, to strengthen labor administration capacity, and to
promote jobs for graduates and access to jobs for the disabled.



As for the financial sector development strategy, an initial draft prepared with the technical
assistance of the FIRST initiative is being finalized. It is expected to be approved by the
Council of Ministers before end-December 2013;



With regard to public enterprises, the communication adopted on May 26, 2012 in the
Council of Ministers presented strategic options for a 25 percent reduction in the
government portfolio (through privatization, mergers, or restructuring), including public
banks. Implementation of these options requires studies on valuation and methods of
privatization, as well as studies on the strategic and operational arrangements for possible
mergers. For public banks, these studies were initiated in June 2013, and final reports should
be available by early October 2013. An IMF technical assistance mission on the subject was
already conducted in September 2013 to analyze the draft report of the consultants. Based
on the recommendations of these studies, a plan of action will be drawn up and adopted by
the Council of Ministers before end-December 2013;



The global medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) for 2014–16 as well as the multiyear
economic and budget programming document have been prepared; they will be submitted
to the National Assembly after they have been adopted by the Council of Ministers;



The main lines of a strategy for reform of the VAT have been prepared and two measures for
the rationalization of VAT exemptions are included in the fiscal annex to the 2014 budget
law;



A strategy for management of the wage bill was prepared with IMF technical assistance. It
defines a recruitment profile in line with increased staffing needs, especially in the education
and health sectors, and sustainable remuneration, thus moving towards the WAEMU
convergence criterion by 2022. It will be adopted by the Council of Ministers by
end-December 2013.



The electricity code will be finalized for submission to the National Assembly before
end-December 2013. It should set out a better framework for managing physical and
financial flows in the sector by (i) a better definition of the activities of the electricity sector
and their legal framework; (ii) a greater flexibility regarding permissible organizational
structures and the management structure for the segments which are granted state
monopolies, which can now be operated by one or more private operators; (iii) the coverage

by the code of new and renewable energy sources as well as energy-saving schemes;
(iv) strengthening the framework for preventing fraud and damaging criminal acts in the
electricity sector; and (v) the creation by law of an independent regulatory commission with
the necessary powers to fulfill its mission.

Economic and Financial Program for 2014 and Medium-Term
Objectives
D.

Macroeconomic Framework

The government reaffirms its intention to reduce poverty and consolidate its
foundations, to make Côte d’Ivoire an emerging economy by 2020, through the
implementation of the PND. This strategy is based on strong, sustained, and inclusive growth, with
respect for women and the environment, in order to create jobs and reduce poverty. The primary
objectives are as follows:
18.



Achieve a growth rate of about 9 percent in 2013, and 10 percent in 2014, as a result of a
substantial increase in investments, which are expected to climb from 13.7 percent of GDP in
2012 to 19.6 percent of GDP in 2015;



Cut the poverty rate in half by 2015, and return to the group of African countries with the
best UNDP Human Development Index rating;



Attain the Millennium Development Goals by 2015, or move significantly closer to them;



Create one of the best business climates in Africa and make the economy more competitive;
and



Rejoin the group of top African countries in terms of good governance and anti-corruption
efforts.

19.
To achieve these overall objectives, the government will ensure that the sectoral
objectives and strategies assigned to the different ministries are implemented. To this end, the
national report on implementation of the 2012–15 PND will be submitted to the Council of Ministers
before end-2013. On this basis, supplementary measures will be adopted to improve monitoring of
investment projects. The government will make every effort to ensure that all of the priority
investment projects included in the PND are effectively carried out. It will also pursue
implementation of structural and sector reforms.

The government objective is to achieve a 10 percent growth rate of GDP by 2014, in
line with the PND objectives. The economy should benefit from normalization of the sociopolitical
and security situation, and from the full impact of the structural reforms implemented, especially
those to improve the business climate. Growth will rely on public investment, which should act as a
20.

54

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CÔTE D’IVOIRE

catalyst to further stimulate private investment. Moreover, the private sector should increase its
production capacity, thanks to the new investment code, the opening of the window to facilitate the
creation of businesses, and the promotion of public-private partnerships (PPP).
21.

Supply will be driven by the buoyancy of all sectors



The primary sector is making headway as a result of the good performance of subsistence
agriculture and food crops, in conjunction with the implementation of the National Rice
Development Plan (PNDR), and investments made in the exploration, development, and
maintenance of existing wells and mines. In addition, implementation of the plan to reform
the cashew nut and cotton industries will make it possible to structure these sectors and
improve their productivity.



The secondary sector will increase as a result of the good performance of the construction
and agrofood sectors. Also, dynamic domestic demand should help sustain the sector’s
growth.



The tertiary sector will benefit from the growth of the primary and secondary sectors.
In addition, the institutional and legal framework of SMEs will be strengthened by the
preparation of the craft or cottage industry code and the adoption of a law to promote
SMEs. Furthermore, the creation of the one-stop window for foreign trade (GUCE), the
opening of the Bouaké wholesale market, the revival of SOTRA, the installation of new
groups in the distribution and hotel industry sectors, as well as the return of the AfDB to its
headquarters in Abidjan will contribute to a significant growth of activities in the sector in
2014.

The inflation rate should level out at an average of 2.4 percent in 2014. The increase in
the supply of subsistence foodstuffs and the repair of rural roads should help improve the supply of
markets and contain food prices.
22.

The current account balance will remain in deficit in 2014. Imports will continue to rise in
line with the dynamism of the economy, as a result of the demand for capital and intermediate
goods. The capital and financial operations account will show a surplus, due to project grants
received, as well as a rebound in foreign direct and portfolio investment. The overall balance of
payments will be in surplus.

23.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

55

CÔTE D’IVOIRE

The money supply should increase by 9.5 percent. This development is mainly linked to
the increase in credit to the private sector which will benefit from easier access to bank credit on the
part of SMEs and SMIs. In addition, net foreign assets should increase as a result of a good
performance of exports and foreign direct investment flows.
24.

The government plans to take appropriate steps to deal with risks that could
jeopardize the achievement of its macroeconomic objectives. There are three types of risks that
could interfere with the achievement of its objectives: (i) a deterioration of the terms of trade; (ii) a
poor rainy season; and (iii) a weak mobilization of financing and a slowdown in the execution of
investments. To deal with these risks, the government will take steps to optimize potential revenue,
by emphasizing an expansion of the tax base, better control of expenditures, ensure a sustainable
debt management policy, and by adopting measures to mobilize expected financing.
25.

E.

Budget Framework

Budget policy for 2014 and the medium term takes into account the main strategic
pillars of the National Development Plan. The priority activities under the 2012–15 PND, as
reflected in the Public Investment Program (PIP), have been incorporated in the proposed 2014
budget. In line with the economic and financial program, 2014 budget priorities are focused
primarily on improving the standard of living of the population and strengthening the foundations
for economic growth. To this end, the principal projects concern road rehabilitation and
construction, improving access to drinking water, health, education, and electricity, as well as
enhancing security and the development of basic socioeconomic infrastructure.
26.

The government will continue to give priority to maximizing potential tax collection
and rationalizing expenditures, in order to create the fiscal space needed for investment. The
medium-term objective is to realize a surplus in the primary basic balance. The budget will continue
to be prepared according to constitutional and regulatory provisions. Efforts will be pursued to
improve transparency and traceability in the public expenditure execution chain.
27.

2014 budget revenue is projected to rise to CFAF 3,051.0 billion, up by 10.3 percent
over 2013 estimates. Tax revenue will grow by 10.8 percent, thanks to efforts to improve collection
of the principal taxes, including the VAT, payroll tax (ITS), and the BIC, excluding petroleum. As
regards port duties and fees, revenues collected on general merchandise will increase by
CFAF 46 billion due to improvements in the recording and valuation of goods, as well as anti-fraud
efforts. The registration tax and the single export tax (DUS) will decline, because of an expected drop
in cocoa production. As for nontax revenue, it will amount to CFAF 408.7 billion.
28.

Maximizing potential tax revenue collection is a government priority for achieving the
budget revenue objectives. To this end, measures involving both tax administration and fiscal
policy are planned for 2014. They include the following:
29.

56

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CÔTE D’IVOIRE



Gradually reducing VAT exemptions, in particular by prohibiting new exemptions to be
granted that do not conform with the WAEMU directives (especially those granted through
special covenants) or which are not justifiable on economic or social grounds in the short
and medium term;



Standardizing the method for computing excise taxes on beverages and tobacco, by
correcting the tax bases on which taxes are levied and the tax rates to bring them in line with
the practices of WAEMU;



Harmonizing rates applicable to capital gains and profits in order to adjust the Ivorien tax
system in line with the regional WAEMU norms;



Introducing a minimum tax for taxpayers under the simplified itemized tax system (régime du
réel simplifié d’imposition), through a withholding tax of 2 percent applied on business
turnover including all taxes. The amount withheld should not be less than CFAF 500,000 a
year which would be the minimum assessment;



Strengthen taxation on telecommunications by:
 An increase in the tax rate on telecommunications from 3 percent to 5 percent;
 The introduction of a specific tax at a rate of 3 percent on consumers, assessed on the
cost of phone calls and internet use; and
 An increase in the rate of tax from 25 percent to 30 percent on industrial and commercial
profits of companies in the sector for telecommunication, information technology and
communications.



Improving the segmentation of taxpayers on the basis of recommendations in IMF technical
assistance reports. To this end, the tax administration is planning to pursue a
deconcentration policy for its staff, to strengthen the Large Enterprises Directorate (DGE) by
increasing its sphere of competence (intervention threshold and coverage throughout the
territory), and to set up a structure for the administration of medium-sized enterprises. The
tax enforcement policy will be advanced by reinforcing inspection units and improving the
coverage rates of fiscal inspections;



For the Ivoirien customs administration, measures will draw on technical assistance
recommendations, including those of the IMF, and on the implementation of measures to
improve the recording of goods by: (i) connecting the customs information system with the
system of the Port of Abidjan; (ii) operationalizing a simplified system of recording the
transshipment of containers in the customs information system; and, (iii) liberalization of
consignment at the airport, by putting an end to the single régie system. Furthermore
customs will step up its anti-fraud efforts by (a) making optimum use of scanners on imports
and exports on the basis of risk analysis and the installation of a scanner at the airport;
(b) increasing surveillance of the sea coast and lagoon shores; and, (c) strengthening capacity
to fight fraud and smuggling across land borders.

CÔTE D’IVOIRE

Public expenditures for 2014 are expected to amount to CFAF 3,973.4 billion,
increasing by CFAF 409 billion compared to 2013. The government plans to improve the rate of
execution of investments, especially those planned as part of C2D with allocations of
CFAF 140.2 billion. In addition, pro-poor expenditures will amount to CFAF 1,517.7 billion, as
compared to CFAF 1,309 billion in 2013. In line with the proposed wage bill strategy, personnel
expenditures will rise to CFAF 1,186.2 billion, taking into account the full application of revaluation
measures, as well as new recruits, especially in the education, health, and security sectors.
30.

The primary basic balance will be CFAF -9.9 billion, or -0.1 percent of GDP, compared
to -0.2 percent of GDP in 2013. The overall budget deficit including grants (excluding grants for
settlement of arrears) would rise to CFAF 364.5 billion (or 2.3 percent of GDP, compared to
2.7 percent of GDP in 2013).
31.

F.

Long-Term Fiscal Sustainability

The government reiterates its commitment to achieve fiscal consolidation, maintain
macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability. To achieve this, it intends to improve
mobilization of revenue, control the medium-term evolution of the wage bill and operating
expenses, reduce the subsidy to the electricity sector until it reaches financial equilibrium, and clean
up the domestic debt situation.
32.

The strategy for the medium-term control of the wage bill adopted before
end-December 2013 by the government will be implemented. It is aimed at eventually ensuring
compliance with the WAEMU convergence criterion of 35 percent of tax revenue. To this end, the
following measures have been identified to respond to the hiring needs of priority sectors while
strengthening management: optimization of the recruitment policy; staff management through a
performance rating system; assignment of personnel identification numbers related to employment
grades, implementation of the Management Information System for Government Officials and
Employees (SIGFAE), and establishment of a Human Resources Directorate in all ministries.
33.

The government plans to reduce subsidies to the electricity sector over the medium
term. To accomplish this, it intends to consolidate progress made in implementing the
medium-term strategy to restore financial equilibrium to the sector, adopted by the Council of
Ministers on November 7, 2012 (Box 2). A delay in the start of operations of field CI-202 created a
shortage of gas for electricity production. To meet national and sub-regional demand, the
government has embarked on a wide-ranging investment program at a total cost of CFA 5300 billion
to build new hydraulic and thermal power plants, and to improve the transmission network to
reduce technical losses. In this effort, it has the support of several partners, including the World
Bank, IFC, AfDB, BOAD, and the Exim-Bank of China. As for exports, the government will bill
quantities in excess of the contractual minimum at the marginal cost of electricity production.
34.

Box 2. Côte d’Ivoire: Moving Toward Financial Equilibrium in the Electricity Sector and a
Substantial Increase in the Supply of Electricity
Achievement of a sustained growth rate requires an adequate supply of electricity at low cost, or an
increase of around 700 gigawatt hours (GWh) a year. However, in the current situation, the sector is
experiencing financial disequilibrium, primarily as a result of the supply of natural gas, the main source
(70 percent) of electricity production. This deficit has led to a delay in investment in the transmission
and distribution network.
To deal with this situation, the government, following an evaluation of the sector, decided to
implement robust measures to boost production and reduce the financial deficit. Thus, in November
2012, the Council of Ministers adopted a medium-term strategy to restore financial equilibrium to the
electricity sector and promote its development to sustain growth. This strategy is based on the
following pillars: (i) a reduction of charges (renegotiation of the price of natural gas, review of the
utility company’s remuneration, and demand management); (ii) an improvement of revenue (review of
national and export electricity tariffs, shift to the general rate for moderate-use customers that
consume over 200 KWh bimonthly, and improvement of collection in the areas outside the centralnorth-west (CNO) zone ); (iii) an improvement in the overall yield (reduction of technical and
nontechnical losses and adoption of the electricity code).
To implement this strategy, the following steps have been taken. The cost of gas from the CI-27 blocks
has been reduced. As for the utility company’s remuneration, it was revised downward and an
agreement was obtained on support by the utility to the sector, in the amount of CFAF 8 billion a year
from 2013 to 2015. To bring demand under control: (i) over 100,000 low wattage light bulbs were
distributed in the communities of Treichville, Abobo, and Yamoussoukro; (ii) export tariffs were revised,
and a 10 percent increase was applied to the rate for industries; (iii) moderate use customers using
over 200 KWh bimonthly were shifted to the general tariff; (iv) the rate of collection on invoices was
improved in the CNO zone, from 40 percent in 2012 to over 60 percent in 2013; and (v) action taken to
reduce losses has led to a 3-point increase in overall yield from 2012 to 2013. In addition, a new
electricity code has been adopted by the Council of Ministers and will soon be submitted to the
National Assembly. Its application will help improve the legal framework for fighting fraud. In the
medium term, the government is exploring options to ensure adequate supplies of gas on a regular
basis.
All of these steps, including those taken in 2012, should make it possible to eliminate the financial
imbalance of the sector and thus make it possible to undertake the investments needed to improve the
supply of electricity, with a view to consolidating Côte d’Ivoire’s status as an electricity exporter. Several
projects for the development of the sector have been carried out or are under way. They include: (i) the
leasing of a 100 MW thermal power plant in 2013; (ii) investment in the distribution network to
improve overall yield by one point a year, beginning in 2013; and (iii) the implementation of phase 4 of
CIPREL in January 2014, and phase 3 of AZITO in April 2015. In the medium term, an increase in
hydroelectric capacity, as a result of the Soubré dam, will help control electricity production costs.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

59

CÔTE D’IVOIRE

The government will implement a plan to settle the domestic debt in order to support
private sector activity. It will make every effort to respect the schedule of planned payments
envisioned in this plan, that is based on the criteria of priority, nature of the expenditure (pro-poor,
etc.), and specified tranche payments by based on discount levels and the tax status of the creditor.
In order to guarantee equity and transparency, orders for payment will be posted on the premises of
the Accounting Unit in question and on the Treasury’s web site.
35.

G.

Rehabilitation and Promotion of the Financial Sector

The government will implement the development strategy for the financial sector. This
strategy should permit a better response to the economy’s financing needs, especially for housing,
SME/SMI, and agriculture. It should also take the following into account: (i) the government’s role in
the sector; (ii) contractual savings; (iii) the poor access to financial services; (iv) the cost of credit;
(v) the rehabilitation of the banking and microfinance sectors; and (vi) the legal and judicial
framework of the sector. The Financial Sector Development Committee (CODESFI) will be responsible
for implementation.
36.

The government intends to accelerate the restructuring of public banks. The plan for
restructuring public banks will be submitted to the Council of Ministers before end-December 2013.
This plan aims to clean up the banking sector, to make it more effective and better able to support
the government’s sector policies (housing, SME/SMI, and agriculture), and be in compliance with
WAEMU prudential regulations.
37.

The government intends to improve supervision of the microfinance sector. Measures
to rehabilitate and develop the sector have been initiated and will be strengthened with the
support of technical and financial partners. Activities, amongst others, will include doing audits of
the sector, as well as preparing and implementing the plan for restructuring UNACOOPEC-CI.
38.

The government will encourage the BCEAO to accelerate the creation of primary
dealers (SVT) and the development of information systems (credit bureaus and registers). To
this end, it will support the efforts of the WAEMU Council of Ministers to adopt the draft charter
governing “relations between issuers and the SVTs on public debt markets of member states.” The
entry into force in October 2013 of the instruction regarding repurchase operations and the
upcoming creation of the SVTs will contribute to the development and deepening of the
sub-regional financial market. Moreover, the government intends to work on creating a secondary
market to make the financial market more dynamic. The government is also planning to promote
financial transactions between the WAEMU and CEMAC regions.
39.

H.

Debt Policy and Strategy

A medium-term debt management strategy (MTDS) will be submitted to the Council of
Ministers before end-November 2013. The primary objective of this strategy is to preserve the
sustainability of medium- and long-term public debt. It reflects a plan to control risks related to the
40.

60

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CÔTE D’IVOIRE

debt, especially exchange and refinancing risks. To this end, the government will favor the
mobilization of external concessional financing, centralize the issuance and management of public
debt in a single entity, and improve its communications with the market. It will also strengthen
government liquidity management, especially through the implementation of a single treasury
account.
41.
The government intends to expand its financing sources by having recourse to the
international financial market, notably by issuing Eurobonds. This initiative is part of the debt
strategy, including the aim of obtaining a sovereign credit rating. The objective of issuing Eurobonds
is to expand financing sources and improve the maturity structure of domestic and external debt, as
well as asset-liability management. The government intends to issue a Eurobond in 2014. To this
end, the government is requesting IMF approval to increase the cumulative nonconcessional external
borrowing window at end 2014 by another USD 500 million, to enable it to make a Eurobond issue.
Moreover, the government will continue to seek concessional terms on its borrowing, including for
major infrastructure projects.

The government will request assistance from its technical and financial partners (TFPs)
to continue improving public debt management. The technical support of TFPs will help the
Ivoirien authorities consolidate the new approach regarding the strategic orientation of the
government’s debt, and thereby build upon the gains from reaching the completion point under the
HIPC Initiative on June 26, 2012. In particular, this support will help the government implement the
new debt management structure and to strengthen the capacity of its services.

I.

Strengthening the Competitiveness of the Economy

Strong, sustainable growth requires a much more competitive private sector and an
improved business climate. To this end, the network of economic infrastructure
(telecommunications, roads, energy, ports) is being strengthened, thanks to increased public
investment and implementation of important public-private partnership projects. Instruments for
developing industrial infrastructure will also be put into play, with the creation and/or expansion of
industrial zones. The government will continue to place an emphasis on health care, in particular by
developing a pharmaceutical industry for generic medicines and making Côte d’Ivoire a sub-regional
hub for hospital services, as well as on education and training, to ensure that companies have access
to skilled workers. It also intends to support research. The agricultural potential of Côte d’Ivoire will
be enhanced by improving farm yields. The sector will benefit from the implementation of the
National Agricultural Investment Program (PNIA), which is designed to strengthen food security and
develop value chains. The government plans to guarantee the sustainability of the coffee-cocoa
sector by pursuing the reform of this sector, including by completing the census of producers. The
reforms are being extended to other sectors of the economy, in particular cotton and cashew nuts.
Subsistence agriculture will post strong figures, with an increase in the production of rice (aiming to
achieve self-sufficiency by 2016) and cassava. Furthermore, the government is planning to organize a
forum entitled “Invest in Côte d’Ivoire: ICI 2014” from January 29 to February 1, 2014. This forum,
which should be attended by nearly 3,000 participants, will be a platform for exchanges among
national and international investors to support the government’s policy.
43.

CÔTE D’IVOIRE

The government intends to ensure that Côte d’Ivoire remains in compliance with the
Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). To this end, the petroleum code was amended
and a new hydrocarbons code was adopted, to ensure greater transparency in the management of
resources and environmental preservation. Moreover, the government is planning to adopt a new
mining code. This new mining code aims to make Côte d’Ivoire a preferred destination. It is based on
the following principles:
44.



Incorporation of best international practices in the area of good governance (EITI, Kimberley
Process, Equator Principles);



Transparency in granting mining rights;



Reduction and control of the time required for processing documents;



Organization of artisanal or small-scale mining operations and gold panning;



Cohabitation between large and small mines; and



Rational use of assigned surfaces to intensify research.

The government will adopt a new industrial policy in 2014, to make businesses more
competitive and better able to create wealth and jobs. The 2012 evaluation of the industrial
sector shed light on steps to take to define an industrial development strategy. On this basis the
government identified the main lines of a policy founded on the following three pillars: (i) a sizeable
contribution from the private sector; (ii) the use of comparative advantages; and (iii) targeted
support from the government (quality, standards, restructuring, access to credit, creation of
industrial zones, and targeted tax advantages). The principal objective will be to increase the share of
industry in GDP from around 30 percent in 2012 to 40 percent by 2020. To achieve this objective, it
will rely particularly on increasing the processing rate of farm products (cashew nuts, cotton, and
rice), and the diversification of the textile industry, by promoting light industries.
45.

J.

Public Financial Management and Governance

The government will continue to reform public financial management. To this end, it
will prepare a standard plan for government contracting, to be disseminated among appropriation
managers at the start of execution of the 2014 budget, formulate an expenditure commitment plan
in January 2014, and pursue its efforts to decentralize management of public finance by connecting
five new locations with SIGFIP in 2014. It will adopt in the Council of Ministers, no later than
end-March 2014, four proposed decrees on the transposition of the WAEMU public financial
management directives after the vote on the organic laws establishing the Transparency Code and
the Budget Law. The government will evaluate the expenditure chain and adopt corrective measures
to reinforce verification of the delivery of goods and services, with a view to eliminating exceptional
payments order procedures (payments orders based on counterfoils [mandats souches] or on
provisions [mandats provisions]) and to limiting recourse to cash advances. The objective is to
continue to streamline and enhance the effectiveness of the expenditure chain, and ensure that it is
consistent with the principles of fiscal orthodoxy.
46.

62

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CÔTE D’IVOIRE

The government will continue to respect the public contracting code and to promote
competitive procedures. Thus, enabling regulation for implementing the code will be adopted in
2014. In line with the public financial management reform plan (PEMFAR), the government has
defined nine strategic pillars, in particular strengthening the transparency of public financial
management, strengthening budget discipline, improving the traceability and control of budget
execution, and improving the operational framework for government procurement. These provisions
should lead to greater transparency and more effective action to combat corruption and fraud, and
offer effective recourse to government officers managing procurement. With regard to government
procurement procedures, recourse to single-source contracts will continue to be rationalized.
Notable changes made to the legal framework for government contracts, include the separation of
the functions of control and regularization, and extension of the scope of the code by requiring
institutions to comply with it, will contribute to achieving the aforesaid objectives.
47.

Implementation of the National Good Governance and Anti-Corruption Plan (PNBGLC)
will be stepped up. The following specific actions will be taken:

48.



The High Authority for Good Governance, instituted by order No. 2013-661 of
September 20, 2013, and the Special Court to Prevent and Fight Corruption will be put in
place in the second half of 2014;



Campaigns to raise awareness and provide information on corruption initiated in May 2013
will be continued; and



The anti-corruption center will be set up after the regulations for its operation are completed
in 2014.

Financing and Monitoring the Program
The government believes that the financing needs of the 2014 program will be
covered. On the sub-regional monetary and financial markets, CFAF 867 billion is expected to be
mobilized in the form of Treasury bills and bonds, compared to CFAF 806.7 billion expected for 2013.
As for external financing, including budget support amounting to CFAF 247.8 billion, the primary
lenders and donors are the World Bank, IMF, AfDB, EU, AFD, IDB, and the Exim-Bank of China. The
government will pursue talks with the remaining creditors that have yet to grant debt relief under
the HIPC Initiative.
49.

The program will continue to be monitored on a biannual basis by the IMF Executive
Board on the basis of the quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets (Table 1).
These indicators are defined in the attached Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU).
Semi-annual reviews will be based on end-June and end-December data. The fifth (sixth) review of
the program will be based on performance criteria at end-December 2013 (end-June 2014) and
should be completed by April/May 2014 (October/November 2014) at the latest. In this effort, the
government undertakes to:
50.

CÔTE D’IVOIRE



Refrain from accumulating new domestic arrears and any kind of advance against revenue,
and from contracting nonconcessional external borrowing other than the loans specified in
the TMU;



Issue government securities only by auction through the BCEAO or any other form of
competitive bidding on the local financial market and the WAEMU market, and to consult
with IMF staff regarding any new financing;



Refrain from introducing or tightening restrictions on payments and transfers related to
current international transactions, or from introducing multiple exchange rate practices, or
from concluding any bilateral payment agreements that are not in compliance with Article
VIII of the IMF Articles of Agreement, or from imposing or tightening any import restrictions
for the purpose of bringing the balance of payments into equilibrium;



Adopt any new financial or structural measures that might be needed to ensure the success
of its policies, in consultation with the IMF.

Statistics and Capacity Building
Economic statistics are a pillar of the government’s efforts to become an emerging
country, and improving its statistical tools remains a priority. With a view to boosting its access
to international capital markets, Côte d’Ivoire intends to move towards the Special Data
Dissemination Standard. To this end, a proposed law on the organization, regulation, and
coordination of the National Statistics System was adopted by the Council of Ministers in December
2012, and was passed by the National Assembly on June 10, 2013. The government will ensure that it
is implemented. Moreover, the 2012–15 master plan on statistics, consistent with the National
Development Plan, was approved in March 2012 and is being implemented. Its strategic pillars cover
the following areas:
51.



Support for conducting national and sectoral surveys;



Improving the range and monitoring of economic outlook indicators;



Holding workshops on setting up the data base for the Integrated Information Management
System;



Preparation of quarterly national accounts;



Changing the baseline year of the national accounts;



Updating the Harmonized Consumer Price Index (HCPI); and



Preparation of a directory of ministerial statistical staff.

64

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CÔTE D’IVOIRE

All of these efforts, together with the 2013–14 General Population and Housing Census, will
contribute to the regular production of quality economic and financial data.
The government will support capacity building. The inauguration of the AFRITAC West
Technical Assistance Center by the IMF Managing Director after a decade of being located elsewhere
is proof of the determination of the Ivoirien authorities to give priority to national capacity-building.
Technical assistance needs in the coming 12 months concern: (i) setting up a customs revenue
forecasting model; (ii) strengthening the tax administration, and especially for the VAT; and
(iii) preparation of balance of payments forecasts.

Attachment II. Technical Memorandum of Understanding
Arrangement Under the Extended Credit Facility 2011–14
November 20, 2013
1.
This Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU) describes the quantitative and
structural assessment criteria established by the Ivoirian authorities and the staff of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) to monitor the program supported by the Fund’s Extended
Credit Facility (ECF). It also specifies the periodicity and the deadlines for the transmission of data
to Fund staff for program monitoring purposes. Unless otherwise specified, the government is
defined as the central government of Côte d’Ivoire, including the National Social Security Fund
(Caisse Nationale de Prévoyance Sociale, CNPS) and the Civil Service Pension Fund (Caisse Générale
de Retraite des Agents de l’État, CGRAE), and Treasury operations for public companies in
liquidation; it does not include any local government authorities, the Central Bank of West African
States (BCEAO), or any other government-owned entity with separate legal status.

Quantitative Indicators
2.
For program monitoring purposes, the performance criteria (PC) and indicative targets
(IT) are set for December 31, 2013 and June 30, 2014; the same variables are indicative targets
for these variables for March 31, 2014.
The performance criteria include:
(a)
(b)
(c)
(d)
(e)

a floor on the primary basic fiscal balance;
a ceiling for net domestic financing (including the issuance of securities in Francs of the
Financial Community of Africa (CFA) – or Communauté Financière Africaine in French);
a ceiling on new nonconcessional external debt;
a zero ceiling for the accumulation of new external arrears; and
a zero ceiling for the accumulation of new domestic arrears.

The indicative targets are:
a)
b)
c)
d)
e)

a floor on the overall fiscal balance (including grants);
a ceiling on expenditures by treasury advance;
a floor on “pro-poor” expenditures;
a floor on the net reduction of the government amounts payables;
a floor on total government revenue.

3.
The PCs, the ITs, and the adjustors are calculated as the cumulative change from
December 31, 2013 for the 2014 targets (Table [1] of the Memorandum of Economic and
Financial Policies, or the MEFP).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

71

CÔTE D’IVOIRE

A.

Government Revenue (IT)

4.
Total government revenue is defined as all revenue collected by the Tax
Administration (DGI), the Directorate-General of the Treasury and Public Accounting
Administration (DGTCP), the Customs Administration (DGD), the CNPS, and the CGRAE, and
other nontax revenue as defined in the fiscal reporting table (TOFE).

B.

Pro-poor Expenditures (IT)

5.
Pro-poor expenditures are derived from the detailed list of “pro-poor expenditures” in
the SIGFIP system (see attached Table 1).

C.

Treasury Advances (IT)

6.
Within the framework of the program, Treasury advances are defined as spending paid
for by the Treasury outside normal and simplified execution and control procedures, and
which have not been subject to prior commitment and authorization. They exclude the “régies
d’avances”, as set out through ministerial decrees n° 2002-345 , as well as the extraordinary
procedures set out in decree n° 1998-716 for expenditures financed by external resources, wages,
subsidies and transfers, and debt service. The cumulative amount of expenditures by treasury
advance as defined by the program will not exceed the cumulative quarterly ceilings representing
10 percent of quarterly budget allocations (excluding externally financed expenditures, wages,
subsidies and transfers, and debt service). The nominative and restrictive list of expenditures eligible
as treasury advances is as defined by ministerial Decree No. 178/MEF/CAB-01/26 of March 13, 2009.

D.

Primary Basic Fiscal Balance (PC)

7.
The primary basic fiscal balance is the difference between the government’s total
revenue (excluding grants) and total expenditure plus net lending, excluding interest
payments and externally-financed capital expenditure (on a payment order basis for all
expenditure items):
Tax and nontax revenue (excluding grants) – {Expenditure + Net lending – Interest payments –
Externally-financed capital expenditure (on a payment order basis for all expenditure items)}
8.
The floor on the primary basic fiscal balance will be adjusted downward (upward) for
an excess (shortfall) of external budget support (program grants/loans) relative to the
programmed amount.

E.

Overall Fiscal Balance (Including Grants) (IT)

9.
The overall fiscal balance is the difference between the government’s total revenue
(including grants except World Bank budget support grants- AfDB budget support grants)
and total expenditure plus net lending (on a payment order basis):
Tax and nontax revenue + (Grants – World Bank budget support grants – AfDB budget support
grants) – {Expenditure + Net lending (on a payment order basis for all expenditure items)}

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CÔTE D’IVOIRE

10.
The floor on the overall fiscal balance will be adjusted downward (upward) for an
excess (shortfall) of project loans relative to the programmed amount.

F.

Net Domestic Financing (PC)

11.
The net domestic financing by the central government is defined as the sum of (i) the
banking system’s net claims on the government (including C2D deposits); (ii) net non-bank
financing (including proceeds from privatization and sales of assets, and of correspondant
sub-account of the Treasury and excluding the net variation of the amounts payable); and
(iii) any financing borrowed and serviced in Francs of the Financial Community of Africa
(FCFA). This ceiling includes a margin of CFAF 10 billion above the net cumulative flow projected for
each quarter.
Net domestic financing = Variation of banking system’s net claims on the government (TOFE) +
net non-bank domestic financing (excluding the variation of the amounts payable) + borrowing
denominated and serviced in Francs of the Financial Community of Africa (FCFA) + financing
margin of CFAF 10 billion.
This ceiling does not apply to either new agreements on restructuring domestic debt and
securitization of domestic arrears or to new project loans from the Bank for Investment and
Development (BIDC) of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). For any new
borrowing over and above a cumulative amount of CFAF 35 billion over 2013, and over and above a
cumulative amount of CFAF 35 billion in 2014, the government undertakes not to issue government
securities except by auction through the BCEAO or through competitive public auction (appel
d’offres competitif) on the WAEMU financial markets registered with the Regional Council for Public
Savings and Financial Markets (CREPMF), in consultation with Fund staff. This ceiling will be lowered
by an amount equal to the eventual issuance of an Eurobond (for a maximum equivalent to
US$500 million) used for financing an additional domestic debt reduction beyond the amount
included in the program.

G.

New Nonconcessional External Debt (PC)

12.
The definition of debt is set out in Executive Board Decision No.6230-(79/140), Point 9,
as revised on August 31, 2009 (Decision No. 14416-(09/91)): Debt will be understood to mean a
current, i.e., not contingent, liability, created under a contractual arrangement through the provision
of value in the form of assets (including currency) or services, and which requires the obligor to
make one or more payments in the form of assets (including currency) or services, according to a
specific schedule; these payments will discharge the obligor of the principal and/or interest liabilities
incurred under the contract. Debts can take a number of forms, the primary ones being as follows:
(i) loans, i.e., advances of money to the obligor by the lender made on the basis of an undertaking
that the obligor will repay the funds in the future (including deposits, bonds, debentures,
commercial loans, and buyers' credits) and temporary exchanges of assets that are equivalent to fully
collateralized loans, under which the obligor is required to repay the funds, and usually pay interest,
by repurchasing the collateral from the buyer in the future (such as repurchase agreements and
official swap arrangements); (ii) suppliers' credits, i.e., contracts where the supplier permits the
obligor to defer payments until sometime after the date on which the goods are delivered or

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

73

CÔTE D’IVOIRE

services are provided; and (iii) leases, i.e., arrangements under which property is provided that the
lessee has the right to use for one or more specified period(s) of time that are usually shorter than
the total expected service life of the property, while the lessor retains the title to the property. For
the purpose of this guideline, the debt is the present value (at the inception of the lease) of all lease
payments expected to be made during the period of the agreement, excluding those payments
necessary for the operation, repair, or maintenance of the property. Under the definition of debt set
out above, arrears, penalties, and judicially awarded damages arising from the failure to make
payment under a contractual obligation that constitutes debt are debt. Failure to make payment on
an obligation that is not considered debt under this definition (e.g., payment on delivery) will not
give rise to debt.
13.
External debt is defined as debt borrowed or serviced in a currency other than the CFA
franc of the Financial Community of Africa (FCFA).
14.
The quantitative performance criterion concerning external debt applies to all
nonconcessional external debt, irrespective of maturity, and whether it has been contracted or
guaranteed by the government. It applies not only to the debt as defined above, but also to
commitments contracted or guaranteed for which no value has been received. This performance
criterion does not apply to:


normal import-related commercial debts having a maturity of less than one year;



rescheduling agreements;



debts to the BIDC, up to the equivalent of CFAF 20 billion, for the period from January 1 to
December 31, 2013; and up to the equivalent of CFAF 20 billion, for the period from January
1 to December 31, 2014;



drawings on the IMF.

15.
A debt is considered concessional if its grant element is at least 35 percent, the net
present value (NPV) of the debt being calculated with a 5 percent discount rate.
16.
The government undertakes not to contract or guarantee nonconcessional external
debt under the conditions defined in paragraphs 12–15, with the exception of debt
constituting rescheduling of maturities and new debt contracted or guaranteed by the
government as specified in paragraphs 14 and 17. To this end, the government undertakes to
consult with IMF staff on the terms and concessionality of any proposed new debt in advance of
contracting such external debt.
A cumulative ceiling for 2013–14 of US$ 800 million to December 31, 2013, and US$900 million to
December 31, 2014, applies to new nonconcessional external loans other than those specified in
paragraph 14 (performance criteria). This ceiling would be applicable to debt-financing of projects,
in the energy, infrastructure and transport sectors. The government will inform staff in a timely
manner before contracting any debt of this type and provide information on the terms of the new
debt as well as a brief summary of the projects to be financed and their profitability, including an
independent evaluation. The government will report on the use of funds and project implementation
(in subsequent MEFPs or to staff). The ceiling will be increased by the amount of the eventual
issuance of an Eurobond for a maximum amount equivalent to US$500 million to be used for

74

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CÔTE D’IVOIRE

asset-liability management, notably by paying down debt (bonds and treasury bills), securitized
debt, and/or domestic arrears. The last day of the period for purchase of the bonds as specified
under the final terms of exchange will be considered to be the date of issuance of the Eurobonds.

H.

External Payment Arrears (PC)

17.
External arrears are considered to be the nonpayment of any interest or principal
amounts on their due dates (taking into account relevant contractual grace periods, if any).
This performance criterion applies to arrears accumulated under external debt of the government
and external debt guaranteed by the government for which the guarantee has been called by
creditors, consistent with the definitions given under the external debt criterion (paragraph 15). This
performance criterion is monitored on a continuous basis.

I.

Amounts Payable, Including Domestic Payment Arrears (IT and PC)

18.
The “amounts payable” (or “balances outstanding”) include domestic arrears and
floating debt and represent the government’s overdue obligations. They are defined as
expenditures assumed (prise en charge) by the public accountant, but yet to be paid. For the
program definition, these obligations represent (i) bills due and not paid to non financial public and
private companies; and (ii) the domestic debt service (excluding the BCEAO).
19.
For program purposes, domestic payment arrears are those balances outstanding to
nonfinancial public and private companies and the domestic debt service (excluding the
BCEAO). Arrears to non financial and private companies are defined as overdue obligations to non
financial and private companies for which the payment date exceeds the deadline for payment
stipulated by the administrative regulations of 90 days; arrears on the domestic debt service refer to
debt service obligations for which the payment date exceeds 30 days.
20.
Floating debt refers to those balances outstanding for which the payment date does
not exceed the deadline for payment stipulated by the administrative regulations (90 days for
debt to nonfinancial public and private companies and 30 days for debt service to commercial
banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions).
21.
The balances outstanding are broken down by payer and type, as well as by maturity
and length of overdue period (< 90 days, 90–365 days, > 1 year for nonfinancial
companies, and <30 days, 30-365 days, > 1 year for financial companies).
22.
For program purposes, the government undertakes: (i) to reduce the stock of amounts
payable by at least CFAF 50 billion in 2013 (of which CFAF 10 billion of arrears payment in
cash); and by at least 50 billion in 2014. For 2014, the reduction will be increased by an amount
equal to the share of an eventual Eurobond issuance (for a maximum amount equivalent to
US $500 million ) to be used for paying down debt (bonds and treasury bills), securitized debt,
and/or domestic arrears; and (ii) not to accumulate new domestic arrears in fiscal years 2013 and
2014.

Memorandum Items
A.

Net Bank Claims on the Government

23.
Net bank claims on the government are defined as the difference between government
debts and government claims with the central bank and commercial banks, (including the C2D
deposits). The coverage of net bank claims on the government is that used by the BCEAO, and is the
same as that shown in the net government position (NGP) (including the C2D deposits).

B.

External Financing (Definitions)

24.
Within the framework of the program, the following definitions apply: (i) project grants
refer to non-repayable money or goods intended for the financing of a certain project; (ii) program
grants refer to non-repayable money or goods not intended for the financing of a specific project;
(iii) project loans refer to repayable money or goods received from a donor to finance a specific
project, on which interest is charged; and (iv) program loans are repayable money or goods received
from a donor and not intended for the financing a specific project, on which interest is charged.

C.

Program Monitoring and Data Reporting

25.
A quarterly assessment report on the monitoring of the quantitative performance
criteria, indicative targets, and structural benchmarks will be produced by the authorities at
the latest within 45 days of the end of each quarter.
26.
The government will report the information specified in Table 2 on a monthly basis, at
the latest within 45 days of month-end or quarter-end, unless otherwise indicated. Tables
F.3.1, F.3.2, and F.3.3 are updated to take into account the expanded coverage of arrears.
27.
The government will report final data provided by the BCEAO within 45 days of the
end of the period in question. The information provided will include a complete, itemized listing of
public sector liabilities and assets with: (i) the BCEAO; (ii) the National Investment Bank (Banque
Nationale d’Investissement, or BNI); and (iii) the banking sector (including the BNI).
28.
The authorities will consult with the Fund staff on any proposed new external debt
contracts or government guarantees on new external debt, including leases. The authorities will
inform the Fund staff, following signature, of any new external debt contracted or guaranteed by the
government, including the terms of these contracts or guarantees. Data on new external debt, the
amount outstanding, and the accumulation and repayment of external payment arrears will be
reported monthly within six weeks of the end of each month.
29.
More generally, the authorities will report to the IMF staff any information needed for
effective monitoring of the implementation of economic policies.

Appendix II. Côte d’Ivoire: External Stability Assessment
External sector risks are moderate over the medium term. There is no evidence pointing to
a real exchange rate misalignment as of 2012. Structural reforms are needed to boost
non-price competitiveness.

A.

Balance of Payments Developments

In 2012, Côte d’Ivoire’s current account balance turned into a deficit, which is
expected to increase somewhat over the medium term. Prior to 2012, Côte d’Ivoire registered a
current account surplus between 2002–11 because of strong export dynamics as well as anemic
economic growth and demand for imports. The external current account deficit is projected to
increase from 3.4 percent of GDP in 2013 to about 5.1 percent of GDP in 2018. Exports of goods and
services are expected to grow by 9.6 percent on average during 2013–18, and imports by about
12 percent . FDI flows (3 percent of GDP on average over the medium term) and loans (2.7 percent
of GDP on average over the medium term) would contribute to financing of this deficit.
1.

Côte d’Ivoire’s debt situation has improved, but the country still faces a moderate risk
of debt distress. The country has benefited from a substantial amount of debt relief after reaching
the HIPC completion Point in June 2012; in particular, the stock of external debt declined from
55 percent of GDP at end-2011 to 30 percent at end-2012. Since late 2012, Côte d’Ivoire does not
have outstanding external arrears anymore. However, debt service is expected to rise, particularly
during 2020–25, because of the large borrowing commitments to finance infrastructure and energy
projects, the profile of French ODA claims converted into C2D debt-for-development swaps
(Contrats de désendettement et développement), and the expected issuance of a Eurobond in 2014.
As pointed out by the results of the external DSA (see Supplement 1), Côte d’Ivoire’s debt dynamics
are sustainable, but stress tests suggest that the country is vulnerable to macroeconomic shocks.

2.

B.

Real Exchange Rate Assessment

The real effective exchange rate depreciated by about 4 percent in 2012. This reflects
the depreciation of the Euro (to which the CFAF is pegged) vis-à-vis the currencies of Côte d’Ivoire’s
major trading partners, as well as lower inflation in Côte d’Ivoire.

3.

Model-based assessments do not suggest a misalignment of the real exchange rate in
2012. This assessment is based on the three complementary Consultative Group on Exchange Rate
Issues (CGER) model-based approaches: (i) macroeconomic balance (MB); (ii) external sustainability
(ES); and (iii) equilibrium real exchange rate (ERER).
4.

The MB approach
5.
The Macroeconomic Balance approach estimates the exchange rate adjustment
required to eliminate the gap over the medium term between the equilibrium current account

82

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CÔTE D’IVOIRE

balance (“the CA norm) and the underlying current account projected over the medium term.
The equilibrium current account balance is computed as the product of the level of economic
fundamentals1 projected over the medium term to the coefficients of an unrestricted panel
regression for Africa (Aydin, 2010). The underlying current account balance is calculated as an
average of five-year WEO projections of the current account balance. The exchange rate adjustment
is derived using trade elasticity estimated by Tokarick (2010).
With an equilibrium current account deficit of about 5 percent and an underlying
current account deficit of 5.1 percent, only a 0.1 percent exchange rate depreciation is
necessary to close the gap between them. This minor deviation suggests that there is basically no
real exchange rate misalignment in 2012.
6.

The ES approach
The external sustainability approach compares the underlying current account balance with
the balance that would stabilize the net foreign assets position at its 2009 level considered as the
norm year.

7.

The estimated real exchange rate adjustment using the ES approach is 1.2 percent (an
appreciation of 1.2 percent). Again, this minor deviation for the equilibrium suggests that there is no
real exchange rate misalignment in 2012.

8.

The ERER approach
The equilibrium real exchange rate is estimated as a function of medium-term economic
fundamentals (e.g., terms of trade, openness, productivity differential, investment, government
consumption). The degree of real exchange rate misalignment is then calculated as the difference
between the actual REER and its equilibrium value.
9.

The difference between the actual REER and its equilibrium value is 0.12 percent, which
indicates that there is no real exchange rate misalignment.

10.

Overall, the results from the three CGER approaches suggest no real exchange rate
misalignment (see Table below). This finding is similar to the real exchange rate assessment
conducted for the 2013 Article IV Consultation for the WAEMU region. It is also confirmed by the
strong expert performance so far in 2013, as exports have strongly increased, driven by food
processing and by cocoa and cashews.
11.

The economic fundamentals are: the relative fiscal balance, old-age dependency ratio, population growth, oil
balance as a ratio to GDP, relative GDP per capita growth and output growth.

Structural Competitiveness

Despite some improvements since the end of the decade-long political crisis, Côte d’Ivoire’s
structural competitiveness remains weak, impaired by structural factors in particular a poor business
environment. Survey-based reports of non-price indicators show that the country trails below SSA
average on most of the recent rankings. However, most of the indicators, with the exception of the
2014 Doing Business survey, are based on 2011 or 2012 data and do not yet take into account the
impact of Côte d’Ivoire ongoing reforms to improve the business climate.
12.

Global competitiveness index
Côte d’Ivoire ranks 126 out of 148 countries represented in the 2013–14 Global
Competitiveness Index (CGI) published by the World Economic Forum—two 5 positions below above
its earlier 2012–13 rating of 131 (Table 1). It also ranks below the Sub-Saharan African average (SSA)
13.

84

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CÔTE D’IVOIRE

on most indicators of the basic requirements sub-index, including in terms of institutions,
infrastructure, macroeconomic environment, health and primary education, but ranks better for
infrastructure. However, it also ranks better than the average for the efficiency enhancers sub-index;
the innovation and sophistication factors sub-index is at par with the rest of SSA. Overall,
Côte d’Ivoire scores 3.5 out of 7, slightly below the Sub-SSA average of 3.6 (Figure 1).

Doing business indicators
Reflecting the impact of Côte d’Ivoire’s reforms to strengthen the business climate, its
ranking in the 2014 Doing Business report improved to 167 from 173 in the previous year.
Côte d’Ivoire is “among the economies improving the most in 2012/13 in areas tracked by Doing
Business.”2 Côte d’Ivoire ranks 4th among the WAEMU countries behind Burkina Faso, Mali, and
Togo and close the WAEMU average (see Table 2). Relative to the 2013 report, Côte d’Ivoire
improved its ranking in the following areas: starting a business, enforcing contracts, registering a
property, and trading across border; however, its ranking deteriorated as regards resolving
insolvency and to a lesser extent as regards paying taxes, protecting investors, and getting credit.
Paying taxes, trading across borders, and dealing with construction permits are the 3 areas with the
worse ranking.
14.

Global enabling trade index
Côte d’Ivoire ranks 126 out of 132 countries in the 2012 Enabling Trade index prepared by
the World Economic Forum (Annex, Table 3), with an overall score of 3.0 out of the possible total of
7.0. Côte d’Ivoire scores particularly low in market access (which includes the level of trade
protection in the country’s market as well the protection it faces in its target markets abroad),
transparency of border administration, and regulatory environment. Main factors that firms
identified as making exporting and importing problematic include access to trade finance,
burdensome procedures, and tariffs as well as non-tariff barriers (Figures 1 & 2).

15.

Governance indicators
Various indicators point to weak governance situation in Côte d’Ivoire (Figure 4). The 2011
Transparency International report ranks Côte d’Ivoire 154 out of 183 in terms of Corruption
Perceptions Index (CPI). According to the 2012 Index of Economic Freedom, Côte d’Ivoire falls within
the category of “mostly unfree” economy, with a rank of 126th out of 184 countries evaluated. In the
2013 Mo Ibrahim Index of African Governance, despite small improvements compared to the
previous report, Côte d’Ivoire’s governance score (40.9 out of 100) remains below the SSA average
(51.6 out of 100), as well as the West Africa average (52.5 out of 100).

Appendix III. Côte d’Ivoire: Financial Sector Profile
This review of Côte d’Ivoire’s financial sector focuses on issues that are country-specific, as the regional
financial sector issues have been discussed in the 2013 WAEMU financial sector pilot.1
The financial system in Côte d’Ivoire is dominated by commercial banks, which hold over ¾ of the
financial sector’s assets, along with insurance companies, pension funds and microfinance
institutions. Access to financial services is weak: only about 11 percent of the population has
accounts in financial institutions, more than half of them in commercial banks and the rest in
microfinance institutions. The regional stock market—located in Abidjan—plays a critical role for
sovereign financing.
The banking sector is highly concentrated, with large banks—mainly foreign—in a solid position;
domestic banks, including five public banks, have weaker prudential indicators. The strong
concentration of assets among the top companies is also observed in the insurance industry (the
largest insurance market in the region) and in microfinance institutions. Pension funds cover a small
share of the population and their financial position has been strengthened following reforms
implemented in 2012.
The financial system is shallow (credit to the private sector is only about 18½ percent of GDP, mainly
for short-term loans). Financial intermediation needs to be strengthened to achieve the growth and
poverty reduction goals of the authorities’ NDP. A benchmarking exercise that compares the
performance of Côte d’Ivoire’s banking sector with respect to peers in Sub-Saharan Africa confirms
the need to deepen financial intermediation and improve efficiency.
The authorities have indicated their commitment to implement reforms aimed at improving access
to financial services and boosting growth, in particular by providing medium-and long-term credit
to small and medium enterprises, housing, and the agricultural sector. With those goals in mind,
they are finalizing their strategy to develop the financial sector with the support of the World Bank.

A.

Overview of the Financial System

1.

The financial system in Côte d’Ivoire is dominated by commercial banks, which hold

about 80 percent of the financial sector’s assets, along with insurance companies, pension funds and
microfinance institutions. Access to financial services is weak, as only about 6.7 percent of the
population has bank accounts and 4 percent has accounts in microfinance institutions (the latter
accounts are mainly lower income households). The stock market deals primarily with sovereign
financing. The interbank market is very thin and the secondary market for government securities has
yet to be developed.
2.

The banking system is highly segmented. There are 25 banks, 18 of them subsidiaries of

international or regional groups, along with a few domestic public and private banks.


Foreign banks dominate the banking system, with the three largest foreign banks (from
France and Togo) holding almost 40 percent of banking assets. The other foreign banks are
smaller, including several Nigerian or Moroccan banks. Overall, foreign banks hold about
57 percent of the banking system’s assets. Most of the foreign banks have healthy balance
sheets, with sound prudential indicators. In addition, there are a few regional banks, about
19 percent of assets.



Domestic banks include five public banks, one of them fairly large with about 8½ percent of
banking system’s assets and four small public banks (altogether less than 6 percent of
assets). In addition, the government holds a minority stake in two other domestic banks
(about 10 percent of assets). Several domestic banks are undercapitalized, do not comply
with regional requirements for minimum capital (some of them have negative capital) and
have weak prudential indicators.



Overall, commercial banks have about 1,679 thousand account holders, mainly concentrated
in Abidjan, and their deposits represent about 26 percent of GDP. The interbank market is
very thin.

3.

Financial services are also provided by microfinance institutions. There are

73 microfinance institutions (about 2 percent of the financial system’s assets). This sector is even
more segmented than the banking system, with the main institution concentrating almost
90 percent of accounts and 73 percent of deposits. The Commission Bancaire supervises
5 microfinance institutions (with the largest one made up of 7 independent subsidiaries), whose
assets or deposits exceed FCFA 2 billion. Several microfinance institutions are undercapitalized and
have weak prudential indicators.



Insurance and pensions make up the bulk of the other financial institutions.
Côte d’Ivoire’s insurance sector (10 percent of the financial system’s assets) is the main
insurance market in the region. It includes 29 companies, 18 of them dealing with non-life
insurance, such as property insurance companies, while the rest sell life-insurance policies.
Concentration is high, with the two top companies holding 26 percent of the market
(60 percent for the top seven). As of end-2012, insurance companies had assets for about
FCFA 526 billion. Indicators for the overall insurance sector indicate it is liquid and profitable,
although the smaller companies have weaker indicators.



The main pension funds, the Caisse Nationale de Prévoyance Sociale (CNPS) for private-sector
workers and the Caisse Générale de Retraite des Agents de l’État (CGRAE) which manages
pensions of civil servants, with assets of FCFA 350 billion (about 7 percent of the financial
system’s assets), cover less than 5 percent of the population. Reforms were introduced in
2012 to strengthen the pension system, including an increase in contributions and the
retirement age.

5.

The Regional Securities market is headquartered in Abidjan. With a capitalization of

about 38½ percent of GDP as of end-2012, the Bourse Régionale des Valeurs Mobilières (BRVM) lists
37 companies, 31 of them from Côte d’Ivoire. The BRVM plays an important role in sovereign
financing; there is, however, virtually no secondary market for sovereign financing. In September
2013, the BRVM introduced continuous trading to replicate the trading mode in use in the world’s
larger stock markets.

B.

Banking Sector Soundness and Vulnerabilities

6.

While they deteriorated during the 2010–11 crisis, prudential indicators for the overall

banking system are broadly in line with the region; some banks are, however,
undercapitalized. 2


Capital adequacy ratios (CAR) for the overall banking system are above the 8-percent
regulatory threshold, and the banking system as a whole is recovering from the impact of
the post-electoral crisis. In contrast, capital ratios are weaker for some individual banks:
about ¼ of individual banks have a CAR below 8 percent and do not comply with regional

2

Financial institutions, including commercial banks and large micro-financial institutions are supervised at the
national and regional level by the Commission Bancaire, the BCEAO and, for some issues including resolution, are
also under the purview of the ministry of finances (Senegal, IMF Country Report No. 12/337, box 3).

minimum capital requirements. These banks, which include some public banks holding a
large share of government securities on their balance sheet—some of which were
restructured at end-2011 and some others that do not generate interest—, are for the most
part relatively small and do not give rise to systemic risks.


The loan portfolio is in line with WAEMU levels, including NPLs/total loans ratios, although
provisioning in Côte d’Ivoire is somewhat higher.



In contrast, personnel costs are very high in Côte d’Ivoire, and much higher than the regional
average.



Profitability indicators deteriorated during the crisis, but they began to recover in 2012 and
liquidity indicators are broadly in line with regional averages.

The Banking Sector’s Contribution to Growth

7.

Côte d’Ivoire’s financial sector is shallow and will require substantial reforms to

provide the level of credit and access to financial services needed for achieving the
authorities’ growth and poverty reduction goals. The ratio of credit to the private sector–to-GDP,

96

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CÔTE D’IVOIRE

an indicator of financial depth, was 18.2 percent in 2012, lower than the average for Sub-Saharan
Africa 3 and access to financial services is limited to a small share of the population.


Credit goes mainly to larger companies and the distribution of credit by sector does not
reflect the structure of the economy (see figure 1).



Medium-and long-term credit, which is needed for investing in housing and in investment
projects, is only a small share of overall credit: As of June 2013, about 60 percent of credit
was made up of short-term loans, about 30 percent of medium-term loans and only about
5 percent was long-term credit.

8.

The main obstacles to greater financial intermediation include the following:



Difficulties in registering land and property, which hampers using property as collateral for
loans and hinders banks’ ability to repossess in the event of loan defaults;



A judicial system that does not allow for speedy resolution of commercial/credit disputes
which limits credit provided by banks;



The lack of information on the credit-worthiness of borrowers and the absence of a credit
bureau widely used by banks for lending decisions curtails credit, in particular to smaller
enterprises.4

9.

To enhance access to financial services and contribute to growth, the authorities are

formulating a comprehensive strategy to develop the financial system, with the support of
the World Bank. They have begun to implement reforms aimed at addressing these obstacles. The
reforms already introduced or being formulated include the following:


Designing an action plan to begin restructuring the public banks by end-2013;



Reforms to the legislation on land property aiming at formalizing land ownership and
reducing the time and cost required to register a property; as a result of these reforms;



Establishment of commercial courts, with the first one already functioning in Abidjan;



Strong support for the BCEAO’s plans to establish primary dealers and a credit bureau.

The BCEAO has facilities that allow some credit verification (Centrale des Risques, Centrale des Bilans and Centrale
des Incidents de Paiement), but they do not have a comprehensive database and are not widely used.

D.
Benchmarking Côte d’Ivoire’s Financial Sector: Where Does it Stand
Compared to its Peers?
10.

This section presents a benchmarking exercise that compares the performance of

Côte d’Ivoire’s financial sector to the performance of peer countries. The exercise is based on
data from the World Bank’s 2013 Fin Stats database. Cameroon, Ghana, Mozambique and Senegal
are among the countries that FinStats includes as Côte d’Ivoire’s peers. For this benchmarking,
Kenya has been added, given that this country has made significant progress in broadening access
to financial services to a wide segment of the population in recent years. The variables used were
selected based on the key indicators identified by Čihák and others, within the range of the variables
available for Côte d’Ivoire in FinStats.5
11.

Recent benchmarking exercises for Côte d’Ivoire’s financial sector found that

weaknesses in banking supervision, the lack of commercial courts and in credit information
explained the lower credit to the private sector/GDP ratio than in Mozambique, an otherwise
comparable country in many respects. 6
12.

The main results from the benchmarking exercise for Côte d’Ivoire are the following:

-

The depth of the financial sector (measured by private credit/GDP and deposits/GDP ratios)
is broadly in line with the expected median for the comparable countries, but it is shallower
than that of Kenya, Senegal and Mozambique;

-

The efficiency of the financial sector (measured by the 3-bank asset concentration and the
overhead costs/total assets indicators) is broadly in line with that of its peers, although the
cost/income ratio is somewhat higher than in several of the comparable countries;

-

While Côte d’Ivoire stands out for hosting the regional stock market, with a higher level of
capitalization with respect to GDP than Ghana, the low turnover ratio suggests there is space
to foster a greater level of activity, which in turn would enhance the stock market’s
contribution to growth.

5

The data is for end-2011. Availability of indicators for Côte d’Ivoire was limited.

FOURTH REVIEW UNDER THE EXTENDED CREDIT FACILITY
ARRANGEMENT—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Approved By
Abebe Aemro Selassie
and Peter Allum (IMF)
Marcelo Giugale and
Jeffrey D. Lewis (IDA)

Prepared by the International Monetary Fund and the
International Development Association



Cȏte d’Ivoire continues to face a moderate risk of debt distress. The DSA includes a
Eurobond equivalent to US$500 million in 2014 that was not in the last DSA.



All debt indicators are below their policy-dependent thresholds under the baseline
scenario. However, stress tests and a low-growth DSA point to vulnerability to
macroeconomic shocks to exports and growth, and to fiscal performance.



The issuance of a Eurobond in 2014 would lead to a slight deterioration in external
public debt indicators, but at the same time help reduce financing risks associated with
domestic debt and lengthen the average maturity of overall debt.



A low-growth DSA in which the rate of GDP growth is on average lower by 1.4 percent
than in the baseline, would increase public debt from 2013 by 1.5 and 18.5 percentage
points to 29.2 and 46.2 percent of GDP by 2018 and 2033, respectively.



A sustainable external position can be maintained through sound macroeconomic
policies, the selection of sound projects, and prudent debt management. The
low-growth DSA underscores the importance of further strengthening the business
climate and investing in sound projects, to crowd in private sector investment and foster
activity.



The profile of debt indicators suggests that the buildup of nonconcessional (commercial)
debt should be accompanied by prudent debt management; caution is also needed to
avoid a bunching of maturities to prevent sizeable peaks, albeit temporary, in debt
service payments. Recent steps to strengthen debt management, the adoption of a
Medium-Term Debt Strategy, and the reorganization of the Debt Department should
help in this regard.

CÔTE D’IVOIRE

INTRODUCTION
1.
This debt sustainability analysis (DSA) updates the May 23, 2013 IMF LIC DSA, which was
appended to the staff report for the 3rd review under the ECF arrangement; the last joint Bank-Fund
DSA was considered by the Board in November 2012 at the 2nd review under the ECF arrangement.1
Cȏte d’Ivoire continues to be assessed at a moderate risk of debt distress. A Eurobond issue in 2014
equivalent to $500 million would lead to a slight deterioration in external public debt indicators, but would
reduce domestic financing risks and lengthen the average maturity of debt. An additional DSA shows that if
growth rates were lower than projected in the baseline, external debt vulnerability indicators would
deteriorate significantly.

BACKGROUND AND ASSUMPTIONS
2.
The stock of public and publicly guaranteed external debt amounted to $7.73 billion at
end-2012. Compared to previous DSAs for Cȏte d’Ivoire, external debt is defined on a currency basis rather
than on a residency basis; this definition is also followed in the DSAs of other WAMU countries. 2 The stock
of debt declined from 54.6 percent of GDP at end-2011 to 30.5 percent of GDP at end-2012 (Table 2),
primarily reflecting Cȏte d’Ivoire reaching the Heavily Indebted Countries Initiative (HIPC) completion point
in June 2012, and the impact of debt relief under the HIPC and Multilateral Debt Relief Initiatives (MDRI). At
end-2012, official bilateral creditors accounted for about half of public and publicly guaranteed external
debt, and of this 78 percent is French ODA claims converted into C2D debt-for-development swaps
(Contrats de Désendettement et Développement), commercial creditors accounted for 34 percent, and
multilateral creditors the remainder (Table 1). In late 2012, Cȏte d’Ivoire had normalized its relations with all
its external creditors when commercial creditors agreed to a repayment plan for remaining arrears.
3.
Domestic debt amounted to 18.4 percent of GDP at end-2012. The stock of domestic debt has
trended upward over recent years from 11.2 percent of GDP in 2007 to 18.6 percent at end-2011, of which
5.3 percent of GDP (about CFAF 607 billion) represents the amount of the outstanding stock of T-bills that
the BCEAO had rolled over during the post-election crisis. In November 2011 and March 2012, the
government and the T-bill holders agreed to restructure this stock into 2-year T-bills, and 3- and 5-year
bonds.
4.
The baseline macroeconomic assumptions underlying this DSA are summarized in Box 1 and
Text Table 1. In the staff’s baseline projection, growth would be driven by a broad-based increase of
private investment, in agriculture, mining, and housing, as well as in food processing and services,
supported by public investment in infrastructure and an improvement of the business climate. The
expansion in supply would contribute to a continued strong export performance as a result of measures to
support agricultural production and processing, and of higher mining output (gold in particular).
1
The DSA was prepared jointly by the staff of the IMF and World Bank, in collaboration with the authorities of
Cȏte d’Ivoire. The 2012 DSA can be found in (IMF Country Report No. 12/232, Supp. 2, December 12, 2012), and the
previous 2013 DSA in (IMF Country Report No. 13/171, Appendix II, June 23, 2013).
2

For the purposes of the DSA, external debt is defined as debt borrowed or serviced in a currency other than the
franc of the African Financial Union (Communauté Financière Africaine, FCFA). If defined on the basis of residency
external debt at end-2012 would amount to $7.81 billion.

Box 1. Côte d’Ivoire: Key Baseline Macroeconomic Assumptions
The baseline macroeconomic framework assumes a stable socio-political situation, high levels of public
investment, and a sustained structural reform effort, which would translate into stronger private investment.



Real GDP is projected to grow by 8.7 percent in 2013, and by 8 percent per year on average over the
medium term, before moderating to about 5 percent over the long run. Higher public investment
(mainly in infrastructure) and reforms to improve the business climate would crowd in private investment
and drive growth.



Inflation is expected to remain moderate.



The fiscal position would remain solid, with a primary fiscal deficit of about 1.5 percent of GDP over the
period. Total revenue and grants is projected to increase over time from 21.3 percent of GDP in 2013 to
24.1 percent of GDP in 2019–33, as fiscal reforms are brought to fruition. Primary (non-interest)
expenditures are projected to increase from 22.6 percent of GDP in 2013 to 25.7 percent of GDP over the
long term.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CÔTE D’IVOIRE

Box 1. Côte d’Ivoire: Key Baseline Macroeconomic Assumptions (concluded)


The external current account deficit would widen over time, rising to 7 percent of GDP on average
in 2019–33 from 1.8 percent of GDP in 2013. This would be partly financed by higher FDI inflows
(3 percent of GDP over the medium term, and 2.2 percent of GDP in the long term). Exports of
goods and services are expected to increase on average by 11–12 percent per annum and imports
by more than 13 percent.



New external borrowing is projected to average 2.6 percent of GDP in the medium term, and
2.8 percent of GDP in the long run. Grants are expected to decline from 1.7 percent of GDP in 2013
to 0.5 percent of GDP by the end of the projection period, as income per capita grows. The residual
external financing need is assumed to be covered by concessional borrowing (from multilateral
and bilateral creditors) and commercial borrowing. In addition to a Eurobond equivalent to
US$500 million the authorities plan to issue in 2014, 3 large concessional loans amounting to
$2.1 billion to finance infrastructure projects (expansion of access to potable water and extension
of the Port of Abidjan) and energy (rehabilitation and expansion of the electricity transmission
network) are incorporated as new borrowing (disbursements) during 2013–17 (a total equivalent to
5.6 percent of average annual GDP, primarily disbursed in 2015 (1.8 percent of GDP), 2016
(1.6 percent of GDP), and in 2017 (0.9 percent of GDP.) For 2015–18, the main other source of new
borrowing is multilateral and official bilateral creditors, but thereafter this source gradually declines
to 25 percent by 2033, while borrowing from commercial creditors steadily rises to about
75 percent of total new borrowing during 2029–33.

5.
The key changes in the baseline macroeconomic assumptions relative to the third ECF
review LIC DSA are as follows:


Revenue projections have been slightly revised down over the medium term to take into
account the higher-than-anticipated cost of tax and customs duties exemptions under the
2012 investment code.



Expenditure projections have been revised down to reflect: (i) a lower-than-anticipated
execution rate of C2D projects; and (ii) the authorities’ objectives of reducing the wage bill
as a share of tax revenue over the medium term (to meet the WAEMU convergence
criterion), and reducing electricity subsidies.



External borrowing has been revised down on average based on commitments for new
external loans under negotiation. In addition, borrowing includes a Eurobond issue
equivalent to US$500 million in 2014.



The composition of external borrowing has been changed to reflect: (i) a Eurobond issue in
2014, which is assumed to be in dollars with a 10-year bullet maturity;3 (ii) alignment with
the authorities Medium-Term Debt Strategy, which includes lower commercial borrowing
during 2013–16 than previously assumed, even after taking into account the 2014 Eurobond;

3

4

The authorities are exploring options for a Eurobond issuance denominated in a number of different currencies.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CÔTE D’IVOIRE

and (iii) projected greater access to financing from non-traditional official bilateral creditors,
which would result in a lower share of new commercial borrowing over the long term.
Exports have been revised up based on measures to support agricultural production and
processing, and on higher mining prospects. Imports have been revised up based on revised
import elasticity assumptions. As a result, the external current account deficit is now
projected to be higher than previously expected.



6.
Another change compared to the last DSA is that the discount rate used for calculating
present values is higher (5 percent against 3 percent). This reflects the decision of the IMF and World
Bank Boards on October 11, 2013 to use a unified discount rate of 5 percent to calculate the present value
of external debt and assess conditionality.
7.
An additional DSA was done to illustrate the impact of a lower growth path on debt
indicators (Text Table 2). This DSA assumes lower growth than in the baseline as a result of a lower
efficiency of public investment that also leads to a weaker private sector investment response. In addition,
no policy response to the growth shock is assumed. The low-growth DSA shows that under this scenario
debt vulnerability would increase considerably: if the rate of GDP growth per year were to be on average
lower by 1.7 percent during 2014-2018 and 1.3 percent during the period beyond than in the baseline, then
external public debt would increase from 2013 by 1.5 and 18.5 percentage points to 29.2 and 46.2 percent
of GDP by 2018 and 2033, respectively. By contrast, under the baseline scenario external public debt as a
share of GDP would steadily decline over the projection period.

EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
8.
The results of the external DSA confirm that Cȏte d’Ivoire’s debt dynamics are sustainable
(Figures 1 and 2; Tables 2 and 3).4 Compared to the last two DSAs, the main change to the results reflects
the assumption of a Eurobond issuance in 2014. However, this change does not change Cȏte d’Ivoire’s risk
of debt distress, which remains at a moderate level. The stress tests illustrate, as in the last DSA, that
Cȏte d’Ivoire is vulnerable to economic shocks, in particular to negative shocks to growth, exports, net FDI
and fiscal performance.5 This is most clearly illustrated by the historical average scenario and the export and
combination shock stress tests. Compared with the last DSA, the baseline debt stock indicators show a
slight improvement, while debt service indicators show a deterioration through 2025. This reflects the net
impact of (i) an improvement due to the higher discount rate as well as the assumption of lower overall
external borrowing and a lower share of commercial borrowing over the long run; and (ii) a deterioration
during 2020–25 because of the onset of the amortization payments, stemming from sizeable external
borrowing in 2013–17, largely reflecting the financing for large-scale infrastructure and energy projects, as
well as the 2014 Eurobond bullet repayment in 2024. While debt service payment debt indicators increase
considerably to peak in 2024, debt liabilities from C2D claims potentially offer Cȏte d’Ivoire some flexibility
for managing its debt service during this period.6 The share in total external debt service paid under C2D is
substantial—just over 16 percent of total projected external debt service during 2020-25. However, the
profile of C2D debt service can be reviewed periodically by the authorities and the French Development
Agency (AFD) to take into account Cȏte d’Ivoire’s capacity to pay and project implementation capacity.
9.
The somewhat worse outlook for external debt service indicators in the baseline and many
of debt indicators in the stress tests compared to the last DSA can be attributed in large part to the
expected 2014 Eurobond issuance. For the debt service indicators the deterioration is concentrated in
the mid-2020s. The authorities intend to issue the Eurobond in order to lengthen the average maturity of
debt, and reduce potential rollover risks for domestic debt—the 10 year Eurobond would be used to
substitute for short-term (2–5 year) financing in domestic currency. To offset exchange rate risk on the
Eurobond, the authorities intend to hedge against this risk on the bullet repayment. Also, the authorities
have sought to increase the average maturity of domestic debt by contracting longer term CFA franc debt
from bilateral creditors.

4

In the LIC DSA framework Cȏte d’Ivoire is rated as a weak performer with a Country Policy and Institutional
Assessment (CPIA) average rating for 2010–12 of 2.72.

5
For the alternative scenarios and stress tests, the historical average for the growth rate was adjusted upward,
because the period 2000–11 was a period of prolonged political instability and episodes of destructive conflict; the
growth rate was abnormally low, on average 1.8 percent per annum.
6

Under the C2D existing ODA debt service claims (as of the HIPC completion point) are assumed to be re-profiled
over 15 years (2012–27), and when they are paid to France an equivalent amount is channeled back to Cȏte d’Ivoire
through matching grants for development spending. Total payments during 2014–27 are projected to amount to
$3.86 billion.

10.
Under the low-growth DSA both the baseline and stress tests show much worse debt
indicators (Figure 3). In the low-growth baseline, the combination of lower growth and fiscal revenues with
no offsetting policy adjustments to contain the fiscal deficit results in higher levels of external debt. The
impact of this is exacerbated by lower assumed FDI, reflecting less crowding in of private investment, and
higher debt service payments, in line with the larger fiscal financing gap. Notably, the ratio of debt
service-to-fiscal revenues under the low-growth baseline breaches its threshold, albeit temporarily.
Moreover, this debt indicator and the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio remain close to their respective thresholds
for much of the projection period. Under the stress tests, debt indicators are again most vulnerable to
negative shocks to growth, exports, net FDI and fiscal performance: levels of the indicators are higher with
sustained breaches of the policy thresholds observed. Indeed, the vulnerability of debt dynamics to adverse
shocks to growth is brought out more strongly in the historical average scenario, where the reduction in
the growth rate relative to the baseline non-low-growth DSA is 2.3 percent per year during 2014–18
compared with a shortfall of 1.7 percent per year under the low-growth baseline DSA; in the combination
shock stress test the shortfall is 3.9 percent a year. In sum, without any policy adjustment, not only does a
weaker growth outlook worsen Cȏte d’Ivoire’s external debt dynamics but also makes its vulnerability to
negative shocks to growth much more severe.

PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
11.
With the inclusion of domestic public debt in the analysis, Cȏte d’Ivoire’s debt situation
deteriorates modestly. Public debt ratios would look better over the long term owing to the projected
improvement in the macroeconomic outlook. Under the baseline scenario, the PV of total public debt
would gradually decline from 42.4 percent of GDP in 2013 to 23 percent of GDP at the end of the
projection period. As in the external debt analysis, debt service indicators would rise in the medium term
before coming down in the long term. Under the low-growth DSA, the baseline value PV of total public
debt-to-GDP would be higher by about 3.4 percent of GDP on average during 2014–18, and 15.1 percent
during 2019–33, while total debt service-to-revenue ratio would be higher by 1.8 percent of revenue and
5.7 percent, respectively.

CONCLUSIONS
12.
Cȏte d’Ivoire remains at a moderate risk of debt distress. This assessment is similar to that
reached under the last DSA in May 2013. In the baseline scenario all debt indicators remain below their
respective policy-dependent thresholds. However, the alternative scenarios and stress tests under the
baseline reveal the vulnerability of Cȏte d’Ivoire’s external debt outlook to adverse macroeconomic shocks,
in particular to exports and growth, as well as to fiscal performance. At the same time, while the 2014
Eurobond pushes up the external debt ratios, it should help reduce vulnerabilities associated with
short-term debt and a periodic bunching of maturities arising from restructured post-election crisis arrears.
The low-growth DSA illustrates that a failure to realize the projected baseline growth rates would markedly
raise Cȏte d’Ivoire’s debt vulnerabilities creating the potential for destabilizing debt dynamics.

13.
A sustainable external position can be maintained through sound macroeconomic policies
and prudent debt management. The low-growth DSA in particular highlights the need to further
strengthen the business climate to increase the potential for a crowding in of complementary private sector
investment and activity, as well as the need to ensure public investment in sound projects and improve
implementation capacity. The steps being taken to strengthen debt management, notably the adoption of
a Medium-Term Debt Strategy and a reorganization of the debt department, are welcome.7 While
Côte d’Ivoire is expected to gradually shift to nonconcessional borrowing as it moves to emerging market
status, it should do so as cautiously as possible, to support medium- and long-term sustainability, taking
into account in particular the sensitivity of this type of debt to unfavorable changes in interest rates.
Côte d’Ivoire should seek to limit the significant bunching of debt service payments as currently projected
in the mid-2020s by seeking terms (maturities) on new loans that do not exacerbate this situation.
14.
The Côte d’Ivoire authorities broadly agree with the DSA and the tentative conclusions
therein. However, they consider that the baseline macroeconomic assumptions presented in this report are
on the low side. In particular, the authorities would have appreciated the inclusion of another scenario
based on a higher economic growth driven by a stronger level of private and public investments more in
line with their objective to transform Côte d’Ivoire into an emerging country by 2020 and halving poverty
by 2015. The authorities feel that they are implementing appropriate measures in order to improve the
business climate, domestic and external resource mobilization, broaden the tax base, increase the fiscal
revenues, and ultimately increase the investment’s absorption capacity while adopting a prudent attitude
vis-à-vis current spending. They are convinced that their policies will lead to higher public revenue and
investment expenditure while building at the same time a solid macroeconomic environment and debt
sustainability.
The authorities welcome the staff’ suggestions and policy recommendations made in the
present DSA exercise. The authorities are committed to following a sustainable public debt
management policy, maintaining a solid macroeconomic environment, and continuing to implement
far-reaching structural policies.

The reorganization of the Debt department entails the establishment of a back-, middle-, and front-office structure.

1/

Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.

2/

Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the

baseline.
3/

Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the

shock (implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).

14

4/

Includes official and private transfers and FDI.

5/

Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.

6/

Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

When a member has overdue financial obligations outstanding for more than three months, the amount

Assistance committed under the original framework is expressed in net present value (NPV) terms at the
completion point, and assistance committed under the enhanced framework is expressed in NPV terms at
the decision point. Hence, these two amounts cannot be added.
4

Under the enhanced framework, an additional disbursement is made at the completion point
corresponding to interest income earned on the amount committed at the decision point but not
disbursed during the interim period.

Implementation of Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI): Not Applicable
Implementation of Post-Catastrophe Debt Relief (PCDR): Not Applicable
Decision point—point at which the IMF and the World Bank determine whether a country
qualifies for assistance under the HIPC Initiative and decide on the amount of assistance to be
committed.
Interim assistance—amount disbursed to a country during the period between decision and
completion points, up to 20 percent annually and 60 percent in total of the assistance
committed at the decision point (or 25 percent and 75 percent, respectively, in exceptional
circumstances).
Completion point—point at which a country receives the remaining balance of its assistance
committed at the decision point, together with an additional disbursement of interest income as
defined in footnote 2 above. The timing of the completion point is linked to the implementation
of pre-agreed key structural reforms (i.e., floating completion point).
Safeguards Assessments:
The Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) is a common central bank of the countries of
the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAMU). The 2013 assessment of the BCEAO is
substantially completed. The assessment found that the bank continued to have a strong
control environment and has, with the implementation of the 2010 Institutional Reform of the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CÔTE D’IVOIRE

WAMU, enhanced its governance framework. Specifically, an audit committee was established
to oversee the audit and financial reporting processes, transparency has increased with more
timely publication of the audited financial statements, and the BCEAO is committed to IFRS
implementation by end-2014. The assessment also identified some limitations in the external
audit process and recommended that steps be taken to ensure the adequacy of the mechanism
through selection of a second experienced audit firm to conduct joint audits.
Exchange Arrangements:
Côte d’Ivoire is a member of the WAEMU; the exchange system, common to all members of the
union, is free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions.
The common currency, the CFA franc, is pegged to the euro at the rate of €1 = CFAF 655.957.
Article IV Consultation:
Côte d’Ivoire is on the 24-month Article IV consultation cycle for program countries.
The Executive Board concluded the last Article IV consultation with Côte d’Ivoire in November
2011. The next Article IV consultation is planned for September/October 2015.

AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (AFDB) GROUP
OPERATIONS AND STRATEGY IN CÔTE D’IVOIRE
Bank Group Portfolio:
Since it started operations in Côte d'Ivoire in 1971, the AfDB has so far approved 70 operations
for the country, of which 41 have been fully completed, 14 cancelled, 7 ongoing (2 newly
approved). All approved operations amount to a net commitment of UA 1,369 million
(CFA F 1,033 billion). AfDB Group-financed operations have been mainly loan-based and
channeled, by order of importance, to the multi-sector (24%), the social sector (20,68%), the rural
development and agriculture sector (20,40%), transport (17,32%), energy and
telecommunications (13,67%), water/sanitation (3,8%) and finance (0,2%). The operations were
financed mainly with resources from the ADB window (more than 70%). The bulk of these funds
(92, 36%) were directed towards the public sector. It should be noted that funding for the private
sector concerns electricity, telecommunications, transport and industry. In addition to bilateral
funding, Côte d'Ivoire received additional ADF resources to finance studies and/or projects in the
fields of infrastructure and agriculture, to enhance subregional integration in West Africa.
Considering the long period of inactivity of the portfolio (six years) due to the suspension of
disbursements to the country, the Bank in 2009: (i) streamlined the portfolio by cancelling the
outstanding balance of eight old operations; and (ii) in June 2011, restructured two other operations
(PADER-Moyen-Comoé and PVRH). With the prospects of recovery in economic activity since the end
of the post-election crisis, particularly the restoration of government services, the portfolio will be
improved.

Since the end of the post-election crisis, the Bank approved, in accordance with the pillars of the
2012 Country Brief, five operations, totaling UA 242.2 million (CFA F 182.8 billion). These include:
(i) The Emergency Programme to Restore Basic Social and Administrative Services (PURSSAB);
(ii) The agricultural infrastructure support project in the region of Indénié-Djuan (PAIA-D);
(iii) The Project construction of bridge toll Henri Konan BEDIE; iv) Azito power expansion project
(Private sector) and (v) Ciprel power expansion project (Private sector). With these approvals, the
Bank's active portfolio includes nine operations for a total amount of commitments of nearly
UA 194 million (CFA F 146.5 billion).
The table below gives an overview of Bank’s active portfolio status in Côte d’Ivoire.

Strategy for Re-engagement by AfDB in Côte d’Ivoire
To assist Côte d’Ivoire in addressing its immense needs, the Bank is committed to a rapid
operational re-engagement. Consistent with the AfDB’s Fragile States Facility, a Country Brief
defines the framework for the Bank’s rapid re-engagement in Côte d’Ivoire over the period
2011–12. A full Country Strategy Paper (CSP) has been prepared in coordination with the
Government and submitted to ADfB Board for consideration at the beginning of December 2013.
The purpose of this new CSP for the period 2013–17 is to assist the country with its quest for
strong and inclusive growth. It will be based on two pillars: i) strengthening governance and

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of November 2013)

I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. There are weaknesses in
the areas of national accounts and balance of payments and public finance statistics, as well as in the reconciliation
of fiscal and monetary data. Generally, the authorities provided the required statistical indicators to the Fund (see
attached table) on a timely basis. In February 2013, Côte d’Ivoire approved the African Statistics Chart, adopted in
February 2009 in Addis Ababa to have reliable data for its internal governance, and also for positioning the country
in the regional and international trade. The new law organizing national statistics was approved in July 2013. A
census is planned for end 2013.
National Accounts: Comprehensive national accounts data for 1996 onwards was compiled in line with the 1993
System of National Accounts methodologies, using 1996 as the base year. As the base year is dated, technical
assistance has been provided by AFRITAC West to implement a new base year and update implicit deflators.
Accounts for 2010 AND 2011 have been completed.
There is ongoing work on quarterly national accounts with the Fund support through AFRITACWEST, with the first
quarterly data projected to be available in early 2014.
Price statistics: A harmonized consumer price index (CPI) has been adopted by all WAEMU members. A new base
year (2008) has been adopted in 2010.
Labor market statistics: No such statistics are published regularly.
Government finance statistics: The authorities provide annual data on the budgetary central government for
publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook. While no monthly or quarterly fiscal data are provided for
publication, they are made available to the IMF African Department, although metadata is lacking. The authorities
have committed to addressing weaknesses in coverage of general government units and public enterprises and are
making efforts to improve the reconciliation of fiscal and monetary data. In addition, the authorities are seeking the
assistance of Afritac to improve the compilation of government finance statistics. The report on financial operations
executed by the government over the crisis period (January–April 2011) is still not available.
Monetary and financial sector statistics: Monetary data for Côte d’Ivoire are prepared by the national agency of
the BCEAO and officially released by BCEAO headquarters. Some shortcomings of the monetary statistics are
common to all eight member countries of the WAEMU, while others relate to systemic issues in Côte d’Ivoire’s bank
and nonbank financing of the operations of the central government and the rest of the public sector. Recently there
have been improvements in the timeliness of reporting data on depository corporations and interest rates.
External sector statistics: The national agency of the BCEAO in Abidjan is responsible for compiling and
disseminating annual balance of payments statistics and the international investment position. BCEAO headquarters
delineates the methodology and calculates international reserves managed for WAEMU countries. With respect to
merchandise trade, the customs computer system allows for satisfactory monitoring of trade data, but the coverage
of services and transfers, has shortcomings. Concerning the financial accounts, foreign assets of the private
nonbanking sector are not adequately covered, while reporting of private capital flows, especially foreign direct
investment in Côte d’Ivoire, is weak. There is also not sufficient information on private debt stocks and debt service
flows.
II. Data Standards and Quality
No data ROSC is available.
Côte d’Ivoire has participated in the General Data
Dissemination System (GDDS) since May 2000, and has
posted the metadata on the Data Standards Bulletin
Board.

III. Reporting to STA
Côte d’Ivoire regularly reports data to STA for re-dissemination in IMF statistical publications.

Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Completes Fourth Review under the ECF arrangement for
Côte d’Ivoire, and Approves US$75 Million Disbursement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the fourth
review of Côte d’Ivoire’s economic program supported by the Extended Credit Facility (ECF)
arrangement. The completion of the review enables the immediate disbursement of an amount
equivalent to SDR 48.78 million (US$75 million) to Côte d’Ivoire, bringing total disbursements
under the ECF arrangement to an amount equivalent to SDR 308.94 million (US$475.2 million).
The Executive Board also concluded the Article IV consultation for Côte d’Ivoire. A press
release on the Executive Board’s assessment of the consultation will be issued in due course.
The Executive Board approved the three-year ECF arrangement for Côte d’Ivoire on
November 4, 2011 for an amount equivalent to SDR 390.24 million (120 percent of the
country’s quota in the IMF, see Press Release No. 11/399).
Following the Executive Board’s discussion, Mr. Naoyuki Shinohara, Deputy Managing
Director and Acting Chair issued the following statement:
“Côte d'Ivoire’s macroeconomic performance under the Fund-supported program has been
strong. Growth has rebounded, supported by a surge in public investment and an upturn in
business and consumer confidence and inflation has remained moderate. Considerable progress
has also been made in structural reforms. While the medium-term outlook is positive, continued
implementation of sound policies and reforms will be necessary to sustain high growth and
improve the living standards, key objectives of the authorities’ National Development Plan.
“The fiscal position has improved significantly since 2011. For 2013, the fiscal deficit is
expected to be lower than programmed, owing to below-target capital spending. The draft 2014
budget is built on conservative macroeconomic assumptions, and aims to further reduce the

2
fiscal deficit while allowing for greater capital spending. Nevertheless, further efforts will be
needed to open up fiscal space, including by broadening the tax base and reducing exemptions.
Improving public financial management should also remain a priority while a medium-term debt
strategy is needed to safeguard external stability.
“Although Côte d'Ivoire’s banking sector is generally sound, it needs to be strengthened to better
support economic development and financial inclusion. In particular, steps should be taken to
improve the supervisory framework, facilitate bank’s liquidity management, and promote credit
to the private sector.
“The authorities have implemented several measures to enhance governance and improve the
business climate but more needs to be done to strengthen the legal framework in order to attract
foreign and private domestic investment.”

IMF Executive Board Concludes the 2013 Article IV Consultation with Côte d'Ivoire
On December 6, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the 2013 Article IV consultation with Côte d'Ivoire.1
Background
Côte d’Ivoire is recovering from a long period of economic stagnation and political conflict that
culminated in the post-election crisis of end-2010 and early 2011. The conflict caused real per
capita income to fall by more than 40 percent from its 1978 peak level, and the poverty rate rose
to close to 50 percent, from 37 percent in 1995. Following the post-election crisis, the new
government started the process of sociopolitical normalization, and quickly put in place an
economic recovery program. This program, which is anchored on the 2012–15 National
Development Plan, has been supported by the IMF under the Extended Credit Facility.
The socio-political situation has improved substantially in the last two years, but challenges
remain. The country is now administratively reunified and a full election cycle has been
completed, while insecurity has declined. Steps have been taken to incorporate former
combatants into the security forces and the civil service. Progress towards political
reconciliation and restoring social cohesion continues, but remains difficult.
The authorities have made considerable progress toward achieving their objective of boosting
medium-term growth to raise living standards and raise the economy’s profile to emerging
market status by 2020. Sizable external financial support, including in the form of debt relief as

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2
a result of reaching the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative Completion Point, a
large fiscal stimulus, and renewed private sector confidence helped limit the 2011 recession to
4.7 percent and spurred a 9.8 percent rebound in economic growth in 2012. Average inflation
declined from 4.9 percent in 2011 to 1.3 percent in 2012. The overall fiscal deficit narrowed
from 5.7 percent of GDP in 2011 to 3.4 percent of GDP in 2012. The current account balance
moved into deficit, driven by a surge in investment-related imports and the strong economic
rebound.
The strong growth momentum has carried forward to 2013, underpinned by strong public
investment but also a resumption of private investment. Growth is projected to reach 8.7 percent
in 2013, while inflation is expected to remain below the regional convergence criterion of
3 percent. The overall fiscal deficit is expected to further tighten to about 2.7 percent of GDP.
Reflecting the economic activity, imports will continue to rise and the external current account
to widen, financed by foreign direct investment and other capital inflows.
The authorities are implementing a wide range of structural reforms, notably, to improve the
business climate, enhance revenue mobilization and public financial management, strengthen
the energy and financial sectors, and reduce poverty.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended Côte d'Ivoire’s good performance under the Fund-supported
program. Growth has rebounded, supported by a surge in public investment and an upturn in
business and consumer confidence, and inflation has remained moderate. Considerable progress
has also been made in structural reforms. While the medium-term economic outlook is positive,
Directors underscored that sound policies and reforms continue to be key to the ambitious
growth and poverty-reduction objectives of the authorities’ National Development Plan.
Directors commended progress in reducing the fiscal deficit. Continued fiscal prudence remains
critical to open up budgetary room for needed infrastructure and social spending. Efforts should
be aimed at boosting revenue mobilization, including by curtailing exemptions and broadening
the tax base. Putting the wage bill on a sustainable financial path will also be important.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

3
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to reinforce public financial management and
take steps to shore up the financial position of the electricity sector.
Directors noted that the banking system is generally sound, but it should be strengthened to
broaden financial access and development. They advised the authorities to accelerate
implementation of the planned financial sector reform strategy, including a stricter enforcement
of prudential regulations and a prompt resolution of troubled public banks.
Directors emphasized the need to preserve external stability through prudent foreign borrowing
and debt management. To this end, they looked forward to finalization of a medium-term debt
strategy. Regarding the government’s intention to issue a Eurobond, Directors recommended
obtaining a sovereign rating prior to issuance and stressed the need to assess carefully market
conditions before the bond is issued.
Directors underscored that deeper reforms are necessary to improve the business climate and
governance. To attract foreign and domestic investors, priority should be given to strengthening
the legal framework and reducing the amount of public procurement granted to non-competitive
bids.

Statement by Kossi Assimaidou, Executive Director for Côte d’Ivoire
December 6, 2013
Strong resolve and sound policymaking are contributing to my Ivoirien authorities’ success in
consolidating the 2012 economic rebound into sustained growth prospects. After standing at a
strong 9.8 percent rate, my authorities expect economic growth to reach about 9 percent in 2013
and double-digits over the medium term as set forth in the objectives of the National
Development Plan 2012-15. The continued satisfactory implementation of their economic and
financial program supported by the ECF arrangement has helped my authorities supplement
domestic efforts with mobilizing the international financial community around their development
goals. As a result, the economy is well on track to reap the debt relief dividends and the benefits
from the normalized social, political and security conditions, and to make further inroads
towards realizing the authorities’ ambition of making Côte d’Ivoire an emerging market by 2020.
My Ivoirien authorities would like to thank the Board, Management and Staff for their support,
which contributed to these positive developments. The continuous policy dialogue has helped
my authorities enhance the macroeconomic framework and implement their far-reaching
structural reform agenda. Staff’s recent visit to Abidjan has once again evidenced this fruitful
cooperation in the context of the 2013 Article IV consultation and the 4th review under the ECF.
My authorities broadly share the thrust of the Staff report as a fair reflection of the discussions
that encompassed macroeconomic stability issues as well as medium term policies warranted to
boost private sector-led growth, create employment and improve living standards.
Recent Developments and Program Performance
My authorities continue to demonstrate a strong program ownership and high commitment to
reforms. They have made further steps in putting the fiscal stance on a sound footing. Fiscal
performance was strong over the first semester of 2013, thanks to revenue-enhancing measures
and restrained current spending. All end-June performance criteria and indicative targets were
met. This good stance is expected to continue through end-2013, displaying a better-thanprojected fiscal position, with the primary basic deficit now expected to decline from 0.3 percent
to 0.2 percent of GDP. Poverty related expenditures have also been better than expected.

2
On the structural front, noticeable progress has been made, and very complex and sometimes
long-stalling reforms have been completed. This includes the elaboration of a medium-term
strategy for a sustainable wage bill, the elaboration of a medium-term debt strategy, and an
action plan to regularize domestic arrears. On the latter issue, following the conclusion of an
audit, my authorities have recently announced that starting December 15th, CFA F 51.1 billion of
these arrears will be paid over the CFA F 98.3 billion recorded. Such an effort is an indication of
my authorities’ commitment to further improve public financial management and provide relief
to small and medium enterprises’ balance sheets. This financial support to the private sector
should add up to the dramatic improvements brought recently to the business environment.
Indeed, the World Bank’s 2014 Doing Business report rated Côte d’Ivoire among the
10 countries in the world that have made the most significant progress in improving their
business climate in 2012/13. Both the creation of new private enterprises and foreign direct
investments (FDI) have risen steeply, as a result of far-reaching reforms implemented in 2012/13
on many fronts, including creating a one-stop shop to make starting a business easier, reducing
the starting cost of small companies by 72 percent and creating a specialized commercial court to
facilitate enforcing contracts. These extensive structural reforms underway together with the
normalization of the security situation and progress in the process of national reconciliation and
political dialogue should lead to further strengthening of private sector confidence and improved
business climate, in line with my authorities’ objective to create one of the best business
environments in Africa in the next few years.
The positive developments in implementing structural reforms and in fiscal management have
underpinned a robust real GDP growth, which is conservatively projected by staff at 8.7 percent
in 2013. Key drivers of this performance are public investments notably in infrastructures,
energy, health, and education as well as private investments, both domestic and foreign.
Inflation is projected to remain below the 3 percent common regional threshold. The external
position is sound; the small current account deficit reflecting high investment-related imports is
balanced by foreign aid and increased FDIs. Going forward, the government is determined to
further improve the overview by stepping up efforts to finalize reforms that are still lagging,
including setting an action plan to restructure public banks along with a financial sector
development strategy. Furthermore, aware of the challenges still facing the economy, my
authorities’ policies for 2014 and the medium term will embrace many issues, from the fiscal
area to governance, not to mention the strengthening of the competitiveness of the economy, job
creation and poverty reduction.

3
Challenges and Policies Going Forward
Sustaining fiscal policy and improving governance. My Ivoirien authorities make it a priority to
maintain fiscal and debt sustainability over the medium term through the implementation of
revenue-enhancing and expenditure rationalization measures so as to make space for investment
and poverty reduction outlays. Consistent with the objective of maintaining an appropriate
primary fiscal surplus in the medium term, my authorities are determined to increase the revenue
base by streamlining exonerations, implementing a VAT reform, and buttressing tax collection.
In this regard, a substantial increase in tax revenue is projected in the 2014 budget, owing to an
expected improved collection of VAT and profits tax, as well as a better valuation of import
duties. Drawing on technical assistance recommendations, including from the IMF, goods will be
better recorded and anti-fraud efforts be reinforced in the customs administration. Going
forward, the government will step up efforts to broaden the tax base while striking the right
balance between the need to increase revenue and the imperative of maintaining an attractive and
predictable tax regime for investors. On the expenditure side, my authorities have a two-fold
strategy to rationalize outlays and enhance their effectiveness with regard to the government’s
objectives. First, they intend to strengthen the budget process by further improving transparency
and traceability in the public expenditure execution chain. Second, they are determined to
continue to improve governance, both in public procurements and in other aspects of public
financial management (PFM).
The authorities believe that the newly created ministry of budget following the November 19th
reshuffle of the Cabinet should help put more emphasis on sound PFM, enhance reforms in the
sector, aimed at maintaining fiscal sustainability. In addition, the salary adjustment programmed
in 2014 should help reduce the negative impact of a 20-year freeze of public sector wages on
employees’ morale and productivity. It should also provide a stronger ground on which the
government’s medium-term strategy for a sustainable wage bill should bear fruits.
Strengthening the competitiveness of the economy for job creation. In 2014 and forward, the
government will pursue its public investments including in infrastructures, with the view to ease
the cost of doing business and hence attract more private investments, and also improve the
non-price competitiveness of the economy. The creation and/or expansion of industrial zones
will complement the network of economic infrastructures (telecommunications, roads, energy,
and ports). The development of the private sector is central to my authorities’ ambition to push

4
growth into double-digit territories in the coming years and turn the economy into an emerging
market by 2020. Accordingly, their ambition is to increase investments, from 13.7 percent of
GDP in 2012 to 19.6 percent of GDP in 2015, 60 percent of which will be private investment. To
this end, ongoing projects include public-private partnerships and many other actions are
envisaged. Preliminary data from the one-stop shop indicate in 2013 an increased number of
business starts and employment in the formal sector. As regards human capital and the skills of
the labor force, my authorities will continue to place an emphasis on the quality of health care
and education. They are also committed to strengthen regional integration including through a
number of regional infrastructure projects which will buttress Côte d’Ivoire’s role as an engine of
growth in the sub-region.
The authorities’ strategy to strengthen the private sector put a particular emphasis on the
development of SMEs. In early November, the government thus launched an ambitious program
to foster the subsector called “Phoenix Program for SMEs”. Its pillars evolve around improving
the access of SMEs to financing and to markets, enhancing capacity and managerial skills of
promoters, improving the business climate for SMEs and promoting entrepreneurship and
innovation. The program will be funded for US $ 300 million to US $ 400 million and is
expected to help increase the number of SMEs from around 50 000 today to 120 000 over a
6-year period and the sector’s contribution to GDP to 35 to 40 percent.
Fostering financial sector deepening. For the private sector to thrive, my authorities understand
that it should be supported by a sound and deep financial sector which facilitates access to credit
for corporates and households. Although the banking system is broadly sound, it presents some
weaknesses, including shallowness, lack of diversification, limited access to credit, and fragility
of some public banks. To address these issues, my authorities are formulating a financial sector
development strategy with the assistance of the World Bank. Alongside this effort, and following
an audit, the government is working on a comprehensive approach - restructuration and/or
privatization - for the public banks, based on what the role of the state should be in the sector.
Improving living standards and reducing poverty. My authorities are cognizant that decades of
stagnant growth compounded by a long political crisis have taken a heavy toll on living
standards. They are convinced that a high growth rate is sustainable if it is equitable to all the
segments of the population. That is why they have embarked on a vast program of rehabilitating
and developing basic services, including roads, drinking water, health, education, security and

5
electricity. The reform respectively in the cocoa, coffee, cashew nuts and cotton sectors which
guarantees that at least 60 percent of the international price be paid to the farmers which number
in the hundred thousands, is a major step to improve revenue and living standards in rural areas
where the incidence of poverty is high. Many initiatives have also been launched to extend
microcredit to women, especially women living in rural areas and suburban parts of big cities.
Vulnerable groups, ex-combatants in particular, are being empowered through vocational
training and will be reinserted in resource-generating activities. All these initiatives should help
the authorities make inroads towards their objective of halving poverty over the coming years.
Conclusion
The past two years have witnessed positive developments in Côte d’Ivoire, following a long
period of sluggish growth. Underpinned by a stable macroeconomic environment and a sustained
pace of structural reforms, real GDP has been growing at high rates and the year 2014 is
expected to confirm the strong growth momentum. The ECF arrangement has provided the
appropriate framework for the authorities’ efforts towards achieving their development goals
exposed in the National Development Plan 2012–15.
For the period ahead, my Ivoirien authorities are fully committed to addressing the remaining
bottlenecks that still impede the emergence of a broad-based economy capable of providing
increasing employment opportunities, especially for the youth. In this regard, efforts will be
stepped up to complete the remaining reforms and keep up with the satisfactory progress made to
date in consolidating the macroeconomic framework and transforming the economy. In view of
this performance and my Ivoirien authorities’ strong commitment to the reform process, I would
like to request the Board’s support for the conclusion of the 4th review under the ECF and the
conclusion of the 2013 Article IV consultation.
