KEY ISSUES
After leading much of Europe in the recovery from the crisis, Sweden’s economy is
slowing together with its main Nordic and European trading partners. The outlook
is for a sluggish return to moderate growth, but there are sizable downside risks
compounded by financial fragilities. Notwithstanding ambitious financial reforms,
Sweden’s large banking system remains a potential vulnerability, and household debt is
high and still rising.
The priorities are supporting growth and buttressing financial stability.


In the short term, monetary and fiscal policy support should continue to support
the recovery, and there is room for additional stimuli if downside risks materialized.



However, Sweden’s main challenge is to further strengthen financial stability. This
requires additional steady improvements of banks’ funding and liquidity positions,
and—over the medium term—addressing high household debt and accelerating
mortgage amortization.



Given the importance of Swedish banks for the region, improving financial stability
in Sweden would also contribute to financial stability across the Nordics, as would
additional progress toward cross-border burden-sharing agreements.

There is scope to improve the fiscal framework, by ensuring it remains sufficiently
countercyclical and introducing an explicit long-term anchor to safeguard a prudent
borrowing capacity adequate for countries with large financial sectors such as Sweden.
Structural reforms would add to resilience and growth. To strengthen the impact of
recent reforms on employment, it will be important to improve the matching between
workers and vacancies, in particular for vulnerable groups. Additional steps to reduce
housing market rigidities will open bottlenecks for re-location and support growth.
The Article IV discussions were coordinated with the Nordic Regional Report
discussions; the latter covers cross-border financial sector issues in the region and
house prices and household debt in a cross-country context.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
A. Recent Economic Developments
1.
After a strong recovery from the crisis, growth has moderated. Following two years
of robust economic performance ahead of most of Europe, Swedish growth decelerated in 2012,
dropping to 0.7 percent (from 3.7 in 2011 and 6.6 in 2010) (Table 1). There are indications that
the downward momentum might have halted,

Unemployment remains elevated. The unemployment rate reached 8 percent, on
average, in 2012—above the rates seen in many of Sweden’s peers—and rose further early in the
year before declining back to just below 8 percent in May (in seasonally adjusted terms). The
increase during the crisis was largely driven by job losses among the young, immigrants, and the
disabled, though about 2 percentage points of the

3.
The krona continued to appreciate. Notwithstanding the economic slowdown, the
krona reached a ten-year high in nominal effective terms in early 2013, as Sweden remained
attractive to international investors. Foreign demand also contributed to low yields for Swedish
sovereign and covered mortgage bonds. While it lost some of its more recent gains at the time
of the “tapering” discussion in June, the krona still trades about 5 percent above its pre-crisis
levels against the euro. In real effective terms, the currency still stands between 3½ and 8½
percent below levels suggested by medium-term fundamentals and export shares have not
deviated markedly from trends (see Box 1).

Monetary policy remained
accommodative. As the domestic outlook for
2012–13 deteriorated in tandem with the global
economy, the Riksbank appropriately lowered
the policy rate by 100 basis points since
December 2011, with the most recent cut in
December 2012. The Riksbank’s latest interest
rate forecast signals no tightening before the
second half of 2014—broadly in line with
market expectations. Also, interest rates for
borrowers, an important indicator of the overall
stance, are slightly below their medium-term
averages.

8.
Financial policy reforms continued. In line with staff’s primary recommendations in
the past, including from the 2011 FSAP Update (see Annex I), the authorities have continued to
pursue an ambitious agenda of improving banking system health. This has included increasing
capital and liquidity buffers and introducing Loan-to-Value (LTV) caps and a risk-weight floor for
mortgages. While these efforts have had some traction and have in many cases been
implemented well in advance of the Basel III time table, the recent improvements in bank
capitalization were largely driven by a reduction in risk-weighted assets, with bank leverage
remaining stable. Also, credit to households continues to expand faster than disposable income,
with mortgage amortization low by international standards. For example, the average Swedish
mortgage amortizes over a period of more than 140 years.3

The average is for mortgages with an LTV below 75 percent and positive amortization.

B. Outlook and Risks
9.
The near-term outlook points to a gradual recovery. Despite accommodative fiscal
and monetary conditions, the outlook under the baseline is only for a marginal improvement in
growth to 1.1 percent in 2013. But activity should gather speed by 2014, with growth averaging
2.3 percent for the year. This assumes that netConfidence Surveys

10.
Downside risks are compounded by financial fragilities and regional spillovers.
While growth could surprise on the upside, domestic downside risks and vulnerabilities remain
sizeable, especially in the banking and household sectors—a risk highlighted repeatedly by the
Riksbank. Mirroring Sweden’s tight regional trade and financial links, external risks relate mainly
to developments in the other continental Nordic countries (Finland, Denmark, and Norway) and
the euro area (see also Table 6 with the Risk Assessment Matrix).


Domestic risks. The factors driving high household debt remain in place, including continuing
easy access to low-amortization mortgages, very low interest rates, strong tax preferences for
housing assets, and still elevated property prices (see Box 3).4 As a consequence, a sudden
and sizeable fall in house prices could have a flow-on effect to consumption—especially if it
occurred against a background of normalizing interest rates from their current very low levels
in Sweden and internationally in the medium term—raising unemployment and lowering
inflation further. This would translate into pressure on banks by pushing up non-performing
loans and bank funding costs (see Chapter III of Selected Issues). Given the extensive
activities of Swedish banks in Denmark, Finland, and Norway, such a scenario would also
have spillovers across the Nordic region.



External risks. The Nordic exposure of the Swedish banking sector also implies that a sudden
deterioration of household financial health elsewhere in the region poses a risk, with possible
adverse regional feedback loops (see Box 4, the 2013 Nordic Regional Report (NRR), and
Chapter II of Selected Issues). However, euro area spillovers are still the primary concern.

Report. See International Monetary Fund, 2013, “Nordic Regional Report.”

SWEDEN

Critically, a sudden and severe re-intensification of the crisis could impact banks, with
potentially systemic implications in Sweden and across the Nordics. Under less extreme
circumstances, a longer-than-expected continuation of euro area tensions could generate
further krona appreciation and make it difficult to adjust interest rates once the recovery
takes hold. Conversely, an excessive reversal of safe-haven flows beyond a normalization of
market conditions—while a lower-probability event—might lead to a premature tightening
of financial conditions, which could exacerbate the domestic and Nordic risk scenarios.

The Authorities’ Views
11.
The authorities broadly agreed with staff on the outlook and balance of risks. Given
the weak external environment, they expect domestic demand to play a larger role than in past
recoveries. They view the main risks to the economy as linked to external developments,
including disruptions to European financial markets and the threat of sharper-than-expected
fiscal contraction in the United States. At home, a main concern is a sudden slowdown in
household consumption as they attempt to deleverage their stretched balance sheets. The
situation could become particularly problematic in the case of a major house-price correction,
although the authorities were not overly concerned about this as a stand-alone risk in the short
term.

POLICY AGENDA
12.
Sweden’s challenge is to sustain economic activity while continuing to bolster
resilience against downside shocks:


Short-term policy support remains important. With a clouded growth outlook, a continuation
of the current macroeconomic policy mix would helpfully support growth this year. And there
would be room for additional monetary and fiscal stimulus if downside risks materialized and
growth and inflation fell significantly below the baseline projections.



Further strengthening of financial stability is key. Notwithstanding recent progress, Sweden’s
large banking system remains a potential vulnerability, especially since household debt is
high and still increasing. Further gradual reforms addressing both areas would not only help
minimize financial fragilities, they would also lower the need for fiscal buffers and allow
monetary policy to pursue its inflation target with fewer concerns about financial stability.



There is scope to explore improvements in the fiscal framework, by ensuring it remains
sufficiently countercyclical and introducing an explicit long-term anchor to safeguard fiscal
buffers, not least to retain a prudent borrowing capacity adequate for a country with such a
large financial sector.



Finally, structural reforms would add to resilience. To strengthen the impact of recent reforms
on employment, it will be important to further improve the matching process between
workers at high risk of unemployment and available vacancies. Additional steps to make the
supply of housing more responsive to demand will aid this process and boost longer-term
growth.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SWEDEN

A. Sustaining Short-Term Growth
13.
Fiscal policy should remain supportive. The government has made supporting the
recovery a policy priority. The moderately expansionary fiscal stance in 2013 (see Box 2), followed
by a planned period of gradual consolidation starting in 2014, is appropriate under staff’s
baseline. While the resulting worsening of the deficit means that the budget balance will stay
below the government’s 1 percent surplus target over the cycle for now, the fiscal framework is
geared towards improvements in the balance in the medium-term. The authorities plan for
revenues to remain largely unchanged as a percentage of GDP. In combination with the 4-year
nominal expenditure ceilings in place, this will, on staff’s numbers, take the structural balance
from -1.4 percent of GDP in 2013 to -0.8 percent of GDP in 2014, and improve it to 1.1 percent of
GDP by 2017.
14.
The accommodative monetary policy stance should continue. As inflation is expected
to remain well below the target during the policy horizon, the Riksbank has reason to maintain
an expansionary policy stance until the recovery is firmly on track, assuming household credit
growth remains contained.
15.
There would be room to react if growth disappoints. The Riksbank could quickly
reduce interest rates further, as well as signal its intention to keep rates at low levels for an
extended period. Likewise, Sweden’s modest public debt gives the authorities room to delay their
planned return to surplus. In the event of a more extreme scenario, non-standard monetary
policy measures—including quantitative and qualitative easing to support growth and deal with
impaired markets (e.g., through the purchase of sovereign and private bonds)—could
complement substantial discretionary fiscal stimulus. Simulations produced for the NRR indicate
that, if a large external growth shock hit the Nordic region as a whole, there might be significant
gains for Sweden from coordinating its fiscal reaction with other Nordic countries given the
region’s strong trade and financial links.

The Authorities’ Views
16.
The Riksbank stressed that monetary policy will remain accommodative. With
inflation projected to return only gradually back to target, the official policy rate was not
expected to increase before the third quarter of 2014. Any further cut would have to account for
the evolution of household debt, given that ongoing credit growth was likely spurred, at least in
part, by the easing of monetary conditions since the onset of the global financial crisis.
17.
Fiscal policy will continue to be framed around the medium-term surplus target.
The authorities suggested that the modest stimulus in 2013 strikes the right balance between the
need to support growth and, thus, preventing unemployment from becoming entrenched at
already high levels—with the Ministry of Finance estimating higher spare capacity than staff—
and returning to surplus. In case of a major adverse shock, there would be fiscal space to
respond. However, returning to surplus and maintaining fiscal discipline is important for

sustaining investor confidence in the strength of Sweden’s public finances, also given its
potentially large contingent liabilities from the financial sector.

B. Safeguarding Financial Stability
18.
The banking system is large, highly concentrated, and regionally interconnected.
With bank assets above 400 percent of GDP, Sweden’s banks are among the largest in the world
relative to the size of the economy. About 85 percent of these assets are on the balance sheet of
four major banks alone, which mostly lend across the Nordic region. More than 80 percent of the
credit extended by these four banks goes to households and firms in Denmark, Finland, Norway,
and Sweden. In contrast, with a credit share of just about 4 percent, the Baltic region plays a
much smaller role (see chapter II of Selected Issues).
19.
Banks are well-capitalized. Swedish banks’ core Tier I capital buffers are among the
highest in Europe, with the core Tier I capital ratio increasing to 15 percent as of December 2012.
This has been driven by a reduction in risk-weighted assets—due to a decrease in the proportion
of corporate loans in favor of mortgages, a decline in lending to the Baltic countries, and the fact
that a larger proportion of assets are now classified on the basis of banks’ own internal models—
and increases in retained earnings in a context of high profits. The major banks’ return on equity
is over 12 percent. While leverage ratios are stable and similar to those elsewhere in Europe,
access to international capital markets has remained secure and at rates close to or even lower
than core European banking systems. In contrast with the early phase of the financial crisis, when
Swedish banks faced some difficulties accessing foreign markets, the euro area crisis has had
little impact. On the contrary, Swedish banks have profited from a “safe-haven” bonus and lower
CDS spreads than many other European banks (Figures 4 and 5, Tables 7–9).
20.
But banks are also highly dependent on wholesale funding. With a loan-to-deposit
ratio of about 200 percent, about one third of total bank funding depends on wholesale
activities, most of which are conducted in foreign currency. Wholesale funding comes, in about
equal shares, from long-term covered and senior unsecured bonds on the one hand, and short
term wholesale financing on the other. About half of the long-term and almost all of the shortterm market funding is conducted in euro and US dollar—in all, about 55 percent of GDP. The
improvement of banks’ net stable funding ratio (NSFR) after the financial crisis has mostly come
to a halt at just above 80 percent, on average, for the major Swedish banks.
21.
Long-standing structural issues create vulnerabilities. The May 2013 Riksbank stress
tests suggest that major banks can absorb direct loan losses triggered by large macroeconomic
shocks. This resilience stems from banks’ strong earnings as well as past low default and lossgiven-default rates. However, in a context of historically high household debt and elevated house
prices, household rebalancing would affect banks also indirectly through the impact of falling
consumption.5 Furthermore, the wholesale dependence of Sweden’s banks—whose evolution has

been highly dependent on global financial conditions as analyzed in Chapter II of Selected
Issues—introduces significant funding and foreign liquidity risks that could quickly become
systemic. It is therefore difficult to exclude scenarios where the combination of a severe shock
with a possible sudden increase in funding stress would expose banks to a very difficult situation
with potentially drastic consequences throughout the Nordic region.
22.

medium term (Figure 6).
23.

Specific measures include:



Raising funding stability standards. Establishing firm interim targets for reaching the
minimum level of 100 percent of the Basel III NSFR by 2018—a goal also explicitly
recommended by the Riksbank—will help reduce structural liquidity risks. Given the lack of
progress in 2012, a faster pace of improvement is needed in order to meet this target.



Improving foreign currency liquidity. Making banks bear some of the costs of maintaining the
recently increased foreign currency reserves at the Riksbank (see next section) via a fee,
ideally in proportion to each bank’s foreign liquidity gap, would provide the right incentives
to manage foreign currency liquidity risks. Introducing bank reserve requirements in foreign
currency to be held at the Riksbank would create similar incentives and reduce the need for
official reserves.



Fortifying capital buffers. The formal introduction of the 15 percent floor in May 2013 moved
the risk weights for Swedish mortgages up from the lowest in Europe, bringing about an
increase in both banks’ regulatory minimum capital buffers and the relative cost of mortgage
lending. However, the very high level of household debt merits gradual movement over the
medium term to the more conservative 35 percent risk weight under the standardized Basel

share of bank lending to households (see Table 7). In addition, a large share of non-financial corporations’ debt is
accounted for by intra-company loans (for a more detailed discussion, see European Commission, 2013,
“Macroeconomic Imbalances – Sweden 2013,” European Economy, Occasional Papers, 141, April, Brussels).

III approach. This standard is generally considered a conservative estimate of the risk level for
the mortgage portfolio of an average internationally-active bank in a developed country.


Raising mortgage portfolio quality. Complementing the 85 percent mortgage LTV cap
introduced in October 2010, financial stability would be enhanced from a steady reduction of
mortgage amortization schedules over the medium term. This could be achieved, for
example, through introducing minimum amortization requirements on new mortgages. To
strengthen monitoring, the measure should be accompanied by additional improvements in
disaggregated credit data collection by the government.



Re-considering tax incentives. Consideration should be given to a phased-in reform to better
balance the tax treatment of household assets. For example, lowering tax deductions for
mortgages and increasing residential property taxation would reduce the incentives towards
the build-up of excessive household debt over the medium term.

24.
Clear lines of responsibility would enhance the effectiveness of macroprudential
policy. The authorities are continuing to discuss the organization of macroprudential
policymaking in Sweden, and recent proposals rightly stress the importance of continuing the
information exchange between all relevant parties. And timely and well-coordinated
implementation of the policy tools can be ensured by putting all instruments at the disposal of
either the Riksbank—which is well-placed to oversee the macroeconomic and financial stability
issues—or the Financial Supervisory Authority (FSA). Alternatively, the final approval of
macroprudential decisions taken by the relevant agencies could be delegated to a Council, with
clear voting rules and with a composition similar to that suggested by the Financial Crisis
Committee. Allocating different responsibilities and instruments to different decision makers
would instead likely complicate rather than strengthen necessary macroprudential coordination.
25.
A robust bank resolution framework nationally and regionally would reduce the
risk of financial spillovers. Legal certainty for the FSA to take corrective and remedial action
against weak banks would mark an important improvement of the bank resolution
framework—a point also raised in the 2011 FSAP. Given the size of Sweden’s banks and their
regional orientation, additional progress towards explicit burden-sharing agreements among the
continental Nordic countries is another important element, especially with regard to systemic
financial institutions. Here the recent agreement between the authorities of the Nordea Crisis
Management Group on how to effectively handle cross-border bank resolution is an important
step in the right direction. As highlighted in the NRR, regional cooperation along these lines will
go a long way to reduce the risk of financial spillovers within the region. In addition, given the
substantial international aspect of Sweden’s banking operations, supervisory and regulatory
coordination could eventually benefit from Banking Union membership.

The Authorities’ Views
26.
The authorities broadly concurred with staffs’ assessment of financial
vulnerabilities and recognized the benefits of additional, gradual reforms. They
acknowledged that banks are large in relation to Swedish GDP, that household indebtedness is
high from both a historical and international perspective, and that house prices might be
vulnerable if Sweden is hit by a large macroeconomic shock. At the same time, they noted that
more stringent regulatory standards, some of them well in advance of the Basel III timetable, had
improved the resilience of bank balance sheets overall. They also stressed that mortgages are
contracted mostly for primary residences and noted that bankruptcy is not a viable option to
shake off debts. While progress along all aspects of the financial reform agenda was on the table,
the approach should be gradual, as suggested by staff.

C. Financial Reform and Monetary Policy
27.
Further financial reforms will help the Riksbank focus on macroeconomic goals. In
principle, financial stability risks should be addressed through macroprudential policy tools.
However, if mortgage credit growth returned to unsustainable levels despite best efforts, the
Riksbank might have to tighten monetary policy beyond what macroeconomic considerations
would warrant.6 The gradual implementation of the financial reform agenda would also permit
monetary policymakers to worry less about financial stability risks emanating from keeping
interest rates at very low levels for long.
28.
The recent increase of Riksbank foreign currency reserves supports financial
stability. Even with liquidity standards improving, Sweden’s banking system remains vulnerable
to sudden shortages of foreign currency liquidity. To ensure ready access, the Riksbank decided
to boost its borrowed currency reserves by about 1/3 to around USD55 billion (10 percent of
GDP)—broadly in line with staff recommendations (see Box 5). As discussed in the previous
section, sharing some of the fiscal costs with the banks will create the right incentives to manage
these risks at the bank level.

The Authorities’ Views
29.
The authorities agreed that financial stability was foremost a macroprudential
responsibility. While the modalities of increasing Riksbank reserves continue to be discussed,
the need to incentivize sound foreign currency liquidity risk management within banks was
supported by all. The Riksbank considered that a high and rising level of household debt should
be taken into account in setting monetary policy as high debt levels can jeopardize
macroeconomic stability and possibly create long-lasting difficulties in attaining the inflation
target.
6

See, for example, the Riksbank’s recent report (Sveriges Riksbank, 2013, “Monetary Policy Report,” pp. 42–48,
July), which discusses the role that monetary policy can play in reducing financial imbalances.

D. Calibrating the Fiscal Framework
30.
Exploring adjustments to a successful model. Sweden’s fiscal framework has been in
place since the late 1990s (see Box 6). Together with a strong culture of fiscal responsibility it
helped bring down gross general government debt from 73 percent of GDP after the banking
crisis in the early 1990s to 38 percent of GDP in 2012. However, a discussion has begun on how
to ensure the framework’s countercyclicality as well as the absence of an explicit long-term
anchor to take into account Sweden’s potentially large contingent liabilities from the financial
sector (see also Annex II).7
31.
Making fiscal buffers explicit. While strong financial sector policies can and should be
deployed to reduce taxpayers’ contingent liabilities from financial risks (see previous section),
they are likely to remain sizable even under

cycle would have to remain in place for
longer, but the authorities could explore adjusting the target rule once the debt-target range has
been reached. A well-calibrated structural balance rule along these lines should also provide for
higher public savings in case of larger-than-budgeted debt accumulation to help preserve the
fiscal buffer while avoiding the accumulation of very large net-assets in the public sector.
32.
Any debt target range would have to be very carefully selected. Assessing contingent
liabilities is difficult—requiring robust assumptions about the size of the underlying exposures,
the national, Nordic, and EU-wide resolution regimes in place, and the economic and financial
circumstances under which they might be realized (see Chapter V of Selected Issues). Staff
estimates that the direct fiscal costs of a potential systemic banking failure could be in the range
of 17 to 90 percent of GDP, depending on whether government support would cover only
insured depositors or uninsured depositors and bond holders as well, and whether support
would be extended based on depositor or bank location. In addition to contingent liabilities, the
debt range would need to account for aging costs and cyclical budget swings.
7

For example, the mission engaged with a new government-appointed commission—the Inquiry on Swedish
Government Debt Management—to explore the issue of long-term debt targets.

33.
Ensuring countercyclicality of the fiscal
framework. There are indications that fiscal policy
has become less sensitive to the ups and downs of
the business cycle since the mid-2000s. This reflects,
among other things, a lower effective
unemployment insurance replacement rate that has
reduced the size of the automatic stabilizers.8
Another factor—at least in hindsight—is the
cautious use of discretionary fiscal stimuli during
the crisis.

Greater countercyclicality can be achieved in several ways.



Local governments have been operating under balance budget rules since the introduction
of the current fiscal framework, which can force them to raise revenue or curtail spending
during downturns. Instead the new “rainy day” funds allow the buildup of savings in good
times that can be used in bad times, helping the operation of automatic stabilizers. This is a
very welcome development. For the “rainy day” funds to be effective, it will be important that
they be administered under rules that make sure they are used as intended. In a similar vein,
the recent reform of inter-regional revenue redistribution should also help enhance fiscal risk
sharing through revenue equalization across urban and rural areas.



The countercyclicality of the central government budget could be enhanced by making the
operation of budgetary safety margins contingent on a clear set of rules. For example,
allowing use of the additional fiscal space incorporated into the expenditure ceiling path
could be linked to economic indicators (e.g., GDP growth or measures of capacity utilization)
undershooting a pre-set threshold for a period of time, subject to judgment by the
independent Fiscal Policy Council. Moreover, in addition to continuing to use active labor
market policies extensively, and maintaining fiscal incentives to work, there might be scope
for a targeted reinforcement of income-support policies to the more vulnerable members of
the workforce.

The Authorities’ Views
35.
The authorities welcomed the discussion of long-term fiscal buffers and the
relation between fiscal policy and the business cycle. However, they were careful to point out
the difficulty of evaluating discretionary countercyclical policies. In 2008–09, there were
substantial concerns about a severe recession, which they felt called for retaining some fiscal
8

The National Institute of Economic Research, 2013, “The Swedish Economy,” Summary, March, finds that the
elasticity of the general government’s budget to changes in the output gap dropped by half—from about 0.8 to
0.4—between 1995–2006 and 2007–12. The impact of recent tax reforms (e.g., corporate tax cuts and earned
income tax credit) is less clear. On the one hand, they might work to lower the tax ratio and, with it, the budget’s
reaction to the cycle. On the other hand, these reforms should improve competitiveness, growth, and
employment.

space after letting the automatic stabilizers work. However, as the economic downturn—even
though large in GDP-terms—mainly hit through a large fall in external demand, the effect on
public finances was smaller than expected, leaving the ex-post relationship between the cycle
and the fiscal policy stance less clear cut. The authorities were generally receptive to the idea of
creating sufficient fiscal buffers to protect against financial sector contingent liabilities, even
though they shared staff’s recommendation to first deploy strong financial sector policies to
reduce such fiscal risks. They felt that any re-calibration of the fiscal framework should take these
risks into account and include the preservation of the surplus target.

E. Facilitating Structural Change
36.
Additional structural reforms would strengthen the economy. Owing to extensive
reforms in the 1990s, Sweden ranks high in international comparisons of many structural
indicators.9 However, there are indications that potential growth has slowed (see chapter I of
Selected Issues and Figure 7). In particular, housing market rigidities have contributed to high
house price levels and have distorted location choices of households and firms, with negative
repercussions for growth. And even though recent labor market reforms have increased
participation rates, it will take time for unemployment to improve. At the same time, the risk of
labor market exclusion has increased, in particular for the young, low-skilled, and immigrants.
37.
Addressing rigidities hampering the housing market. The demand for housing is
outstripping supply—especially in urban areas—owing to several constraints, including the
monopoly enjoyed by local municipalities over planning and zoning, a highly-regulated rental
market, lengthy bureaucratic processes for permits, and strict zoning and environmental
regulations. This, combined with low financing rates for consumers, has contributed to elevated
house prices (see the NRR). Well-coordinated steps to gradually increase land supply and to raise
the incentives to invest in residential construction would help ease supply-side restrictions, for
example through additional reforms of the rental market, simplifying building regulations, and
increasing competition in the construction sector. Stronger construction activity and tackling
bottlenecks for re-location would, in turn, support growth both in the short and longer term.
38.
Continuing labor market reform. Vulnerable groups such as the young, low-skilled, and
foreign born are particularly exposed to an unexpected slowdown in growth. They also face a
higher risk than others of long-term unemployment, which could potentially lead to loss of skills
and earning capacity. Stimulating demand for these groups in a targeted way and continuing to
help them improve their job skills through vocational training and education would improve the
matching process between workers and available vacancies, and facilitate transition, especially
from school to work. This would help reduce unemployment and support growth. Easing the still
high levels of job protection on permanent job contracts could reduce labor market duality and
improve labor market efficiency overall.

The Authorities’ Views
39.
The authorities are well aware of the supply constraints in the housing market and
are looking very closely at labor market developments. They recognized the difficulty in
implementing reforms to increase housing supply in urban areas since many decisions are
located at the municipality level. With respect to labor market reforms, the authorities have
already started taking steps to improve training and education for jobs as reflected in both the
Budget Bill and Spring Bill of 2013. Nevertheless, they noted that further steps will be necessary
to address the elevated level of unemployment, especially among the young and foreign-born
facing the risk of becoming long-term unemployed.

STAFF APPRAISAL
40.
Sweden’s economy performed well through the crisis, but growth has moderated.
Sweden led much of the rest of Europe in the recovery, but the economy decelerated in 2012
together with its main trading partners. Uncertainty about euro area developments contributes
to weak investment. And while housing credit continues to expand faster than disposable
income, consumers remain cautious overall. Headline inflation has turned negative, reflecting the
strengthening of the krona amidst safe-haven flows, as well as the opening of a small output
gap. In real effective terms, the krona remains below and the external position appears stronger
than those suggested by medium-term fundamentals, likely reflecting structural factors such as
higher saving rates following past pension reforms.
41.
The outlook is for gradual improvement. At about 1.1 percent, growth will remain
modest this year. The economy is expected to gather speed by 2014, reaching 2.3 percent for the
year, with exports and private expenditure picking up as the external uncertainty recedes.
Meanwhile, unemployment will only gradually decline from current elevated levels, and inflation
will remain subdued in the near term before picking up again in 2014.
42.
Financial fragilities compound downside risks and spillovers. A re-intensification of
the euro area crisis could hurt growth through negative trade and confidence shocks.
Importantly, it could adversely affect Sweden’s very large and wholesale-dependent banking
sector. Financial fragilities are also a key risk at home. With household debt now at more than
1.7 times of disposable income, a sudden and sizeable fall in house prices would not only affect
unemployment and consumption, it could also push up non-performing loans and bank funding
costs. Given the strong cross-Nordic activities of Swedish banks, such a scenario would have
spillovers across the Nordics. Conversely, sudden deteriorations of household financial health
elsewhere in the region pose risks for Sweden, with possible negative regional feedback loops.
43.
Short-term macroeconomic policies are appropriately supportive. Monetary policy
rates are low and the fiscal stance is mildly expansionary. If growth disappointed and inflation
remained subdued for longer than expected, there would be room for additional interest rate
cuts, assuming household credit growth remains contained, and consideration should be given

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

SWEDEN

to slowing the pace of structural consolidation. In case of a more extreme adverse shock, nonstandard monetary policy measures could be implemented along with sizeable discretionary
fiscal stimulus.
44.
Securing financial stability is the main challenge ahead. The authorities continue to
take ambitious steps to foster financial stability, including by strengthening capital requirements,
introducing a LTV cap for household mortgages, and introducing a floor for minimum risk
weights on mortgages. However, given the high level of household debt and the size of
Sweden’s banking system, further reforms would help minimize financial fragilities. They would
also lower the need for fiscal buffers and allow monetary policy to pursue its inflation target with
fewer concerns about financial stability.
45.
This calls for a comprehensive but gradual financial reform agenda. It will be most
effective if applied to both the banks and households, and in a gradual manner to limit any
negative impact on growth: (i) There is a need for further improvements of banks’ funding and
liquidity positions, including through raising funding stability standards and making banks bear
some of the costs of maintaining the recently increased foreign currency reserves at the
Riksbank. (ii) In addition, there is reason to consider further increases of mortgage risk weight
minima over the medium-term. Risk weights should increase faster if credit and house prices
heat up significantly again. On the household side, over the medium term, (iii) a phased-in
reduction of tax incentives towards the buildup of excessive household debt and
(iv) improving mortgage amortization will add to financial stability.
46.
Better coordination of macroprudential policy is also key. Information exchange
between all parties involved is important, but it will be just as crucial to ensure that
macroprudential policy is implemented in a timely and well-coordinated manner. The first option
would be to put all policy tools into the hands of a single agency. The Riksbank is well-placed to
monitor macroeconomic and financial stability but alternatively, the FSA could be put in charge.
Close consultation with others would be required in both cases. A third option could involve final
approval of decisions taken by individual authorities by a Council, with clear voting rules and with
a composition similar to that suggested by the Financial Crisis Committee. Sharing instruments
and responsibilities between decision makers would instead likely complicate the necessary
coordination of macroprudential policy.
47.
Internationally, further progress towards clear ex ante burden sharing
arrangements in the Nordic-Baltic region would reduce the risk of financial spillovers.
Similarly, keeping an open mind toward Banking Union membership could eventually allow
improvements in supervisory and regulatory coordination across the entire area of operation of
Sweden’s large banks.
48.
Implementation of the financial reform agenda would allow the Riksbank to focus
on its macroeconomic policy goals. Financial stability risks should be addressed foremost
through macroprudential policy tools. But a return of unsustainable mortgage credit growth
despite strong macroprudential efforts might mean that the Riksbank will have to raise interest

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SWEDEN

rates higher than warranted by macroeconomic considerations alone. Similarly, with strong
macroprudential policies in place, it would be free to counter risk scenarios, for example by
committing to keeping interest rates low for longer or dealing with impaired markets.
49.
Foreign currency reserves help support financial stability. Even with the recent
progress in improving banks’ liquidity standards, Swedish banks remain vulnerable to sudden
shortages of foreign currency liquidity. This calls for readily usable foreign liquidity broadly in line
with the recent increase in borrowed reserves held at the Riksbank.
50.
The need for a fiscal buffer could be made more explicit. The existing framework has
served Sweden well. However, it could be strengthened by including a longer-term anchor to
ensure the government maintains room to borrow adequate for countries with large financial
sectors such as Sweden, while taking into account cyclical budget swings and aging costs.
Explicitly providing for such a fiscal buffer could mean, for example, keeping actual debt ratios in
a range well below the Maastricht treaty criterion of 60 percent of GDP. In this context, the
authorities could explore the introduction of a debt target range with a well-calibrated structural
balance rule that also provides for higher public savings in case of larger-than-budgeted debt
accumulation.
51.
In addition, it will be important to ensure that the fiscal framework remains
sufficiently countercyclical. This could be achieved in several ways: First, the new “rainy day”
funds at the local level should be administered under rules that promote their countercyclical use
as intended. Second, the safety margins incorporated in the central government budget could
be made contingent on a clear set of rules to enhance countercyclicality. Finally, active labor
market policies should continue to be used extensively, and there might be scope for a targeted
re-enforcement of income-support policies to the more vulnerable members of the workforce.
52.
Structural reforms to strengthen the labor market and relieve housing bottlenecks
will add to the resilience of the economy. To strengthen the impact of recent reforms on jobs
and growth, it will be essential to improve the matching between workers and available vacancies
and facilitate transition—especially for vulnerable groups. This can be accomplished by
stimulating demand for young and foreign born workers in a targeted way and by continuing to
help them improve their job skills. At the same time, further steps to address housing market
rigidities would also be helpful in supporting growth, including by increasing land supply and
raising incentives to invest in residential construction.
53.
It is recommended that Sweden remains on the standard 12-month Article IV
consultation cycle.

Box 1. Exchange Rate and Current Account1
Strength and volatility. The Swedish foreign
currency exchange market is relatively small,
subjecting the krona to substantial volatility. The
krona’s recent decline in response to the discussion
of “tapering” the Federal Reserve’s quantitative
easing program is a case in point. While the krona
dropped by close to 3 percent against the euro
within a week, the move was well within historical
patterns. Relative to pre-crisis levels, the krona
remains in a relatively strong position. Between its
trough in March 2009 and May 2013, it appreciated
by 23 percent against the euro and by about 20
percent in nominal effective terms. Based on
medium-term fundamentals, there is further room for
strengthening. Staff estimates suggest that, as of May
2013, the krona was about 3½ to 8½ percent below
its equilibrium level in real effective terms, which is
also in line with IMF’s EBA and CGER based
methodology.
Current account surplus. At around 7 percent of
GDP, the current account remained in strong surplus
in 2012, almost unchanged from 2011. This, in part,
reflects Sweden’s continued strong export
competitiveness, especially in the investment good,
forestry, and steel categories. According to staff
estimates, the current account surplus is 2–4 percent
of GDP stronger in cyclically-adjusted terms than
what is suggested by medium-term fundamentals.

and no foreign exchange rate intervention for over a
decade. This is in part explained by social protection reforms and also by measurement issues in the Net Foreign
Assets (NFA) position. First, pension and other social protection reforms—notably a phased shift to a defined
contributions pension scheme and a progressive shrinkage in transfers—since the mid-1990s have increased
household net saving. At the same time, although the measured net international investment (net IIP) position
stands at around -15 percent of GDP, the cumulative sum of current account surpluses over the past decade
suggests that the (notional) net IIP should be closer to around 50 percent of GDP. The difference is potentially due
to the accounting treatment of equity securities (which dominate the foreign asset positions), as well of equity
holdings in subsidiaries.

Box 2. Key Elements of the 2013 Budget and Spring Bills1
The central government’s 2013 budget. The Government's 2013 Budget Bill reports the central government
budget, while the 2013 Spring Fiscal Policy Bill (Spring Bill) provides updates and contains the government’s
proposed economic policy and budget guidelines over the near to longer term. Combined, the two Bills will, on
staff’s projections, result in general government net lending of -1.6 percent of GDP in 2013, improving to -0.9
percent in 2014, and returning to surplus by 2016. While this is closely aligned with the authorities’ near-term
projections, the authorities project a faster improvement over the medium term with expenditures in percent of
GDP declining more rapidly than under staff’s projections.
Mildly expansionary stance. As growth deteriorated, the 2013 budget became more expansionary than
anticipated in the 2012 Spring Bill, which had projected a net lending surplus of 0.3 percent of GDP in 2013.
Overall, the budgets taken together now contain additional measures of SEK 25.7 billion (about 0.7 percent of
GDP), of which SEK 3 billion in 2013–14 were included in the Spring Bill. Key elements of the 2013 budget centered
on strengthening growth and lowering unemployment:
Growth and competitiveness: increasing investments in infrastructure (additional SEK 700 million in the
Spring Bill for railway operations and maintenance in 2013), research and innovation; lowering corporate taxes
from 26.3 percent to 22 percent; introducing a tax credit for investors; redistributing measures for regional
growth (SEK 40 million invested in both 2013 and 2014 in the Spring Bill).



Employment: targeting integration measures for young and those born abroad; increasing the number of
places for vocational adult education centers (the Spring Bill assigns SEK 700 million in both 2013 and 2014),
work experience and employment training, and engineering and nursing programs.



Equitable distribution: lowering taxes for pensioners, implemented by raising the higher basic income tax
allowance, aiming at increasing the net income of a pensioner by approximately SEK 700 per year.

Box 3. Sweden’s Housing Market and Financial Vulnerabilities1
Elevated house prices. Swedish house prices are potentially overvalued by more than 15 percent. House prices
have more than doubled since the mid-1990s, increasing by about 140 percent in real terms between 1995 and
2007 and remaining broadly stable since then. Current estimates suggest that house prices are overvalued by 15
to 18 percent, accounting for rental regulations (see NRR).
Factors behind the increase since the mid-1990s. A
number of factors explain the house price increases. In
addition to high and stable pre-crisis income growth,
supply constraints played a large role. Housing
construction decreased substantially after the 1990s
crisis and remained subdued since then due to several
structural factors (see section on Facilitating Structural
Change). For example, the number of average housing
starts from 1993 to 2012 was only 1/3 of the average
amount during 1970–92. More recently, very low
interst rates helped sustain credit growth and housing
demand. Other factors such as population growth due
to immigration and the low-interest environment have
also contributed to the house price increases.

Mortgage credit has high Loan-to-Value (LTV)
ratios. Despite the large appreciation in house prices, the Swedish mortgage LTV distribution is not skewed to the
left but is centered on its mean of 63 percent—above most countries in the region. This is driven partly by new
mortgage loans (including refinancing operations), which are concentrated around high LTV ratios. Specifically,
most new mortgage loans in Sweden are concentrated around the 75 percent level (the Swedish Bankers’
Association recommends that mortgages with LTV ratios exceeding 75 percent should be amortized) or the LTV
cap of 85 percent.

Long amortization profiles also contribute to high LTV ratios. Amortization levels in Sweden are very low at 43
years for mortgages with LTV ratios below 75 percent and positive amortization, or more than 140 years if the
unamortized mortgages are included (by assuming that borrowers amortize the same volume in SEK per year on
these loans as they actually amortize on their positive amortization mortgages). In fact, the share of interest only
loans in Sweden is about 71 percent for mortgages with LTV ratios below 75 percent in 2012, well above that in

Notes: Typically, Finnish mortgages include an amortization
schedule, and reported loans correspond to bullet bridge-loans
(connected to buying-selling chains), which have maturity under
one year; for Denmark, the share of interest only loans (both as a
share of total loans and new loans) correspond to the fraction of
deferred amortized loans ; for Sweden the estimate corresponds
to mortgage stock that have LTV below 75 percent.

Box 4. Nordic Regional Report: Key Messages1
The Nordics as a Region. Robust social and economic institutions and a high degree of trade and financial
openness have characterized the structure of the four continental Nordic economies (Denmark, Finland, Norway,
and Sweden) since the 1990s, generating important benefits in the form of high income equality, strong labor
markets, and low public debt. While there are also important differences—notably monetary and exchange rate
regimes and resource endowments— the countries also share a large, concentrated, and highly integrated banking
sector. When combined with high household debt and house prices, the region is increasingly susceptible to
shocks both from within and beyond its borders. The pilot Nordic Regional Report (NRR), scheduled for
presentation to the Board on August 30, 2013, is set to examine these common links and challenges.
Challenges of a large, interconnected banking sector. Six banks dominate the region—four of them
headquartered in Sweden—accounting for approximately 95 percent of the assets of all publicly-listed Nordic
banks and with close to 85 percent of their combined credit exposures and deposits within the four countries. In
addition, the total assets of publicly-traded banks in Denmark and Sweden stand at around 230 and 360 percent
of GDP, respectively. The overall scale, concentration, and integration of the banking sector, as well as its reliance
on wholesale funding (both short term and covered bonds), translate into a need for strong national policies to
mitigate vulnerabilities, complemented by common regional strategies to tackle cross-border issues. The former
implies a complete macroprudential toolkit with strong fiscal buffers at the national level, while the latter suggests
regional macroprudential minima and binding frameworks for common resolution and ex ante burden sharing.
Implications for Sweden. With most of the largest Nordic banks operating out of Sweden, the country acts as a
regional financial hub with implications for Swedish financial sector policies (see also Chapter II of Selected Issues).
While Swedish borrowers draw from a relatively large number of creditors, Swedish banks are lending
predominantly to Nordic and, to a smaller degree, Baltic borrowers. Therefore, events triggering (large enough)
spillovers and credit losses in these key markets would generate significant pressure to deleverage and reduce
lending in Sweden, with potentially severe real economic repercussions. Hence, as will be stressed in the NRR,
robust national policies that secure the soundness of Swedish international banking groups will benefit borrowers
not only in Sweden but across the Nordic-Baltic region.

Box 5. Increasing Insurance against Banks’ Foreign Exchange Funding Exposures1
Higher reserves. In December 2012, the Riksbank decided to increase its foreign exchange reserves (FXR) by SEK
100 billion. The central bank explained that external risks remained high and that banks’ potential foreign
2
exchange liquidity needs had increased in nominal terms. The increase is being financed via sovereign debt
issuance, and will eventually raise reserves to SEK 414 billion ($55 billion) or about 10 percent of GDP.
Liquidity needs during the crisis. The measure came against a background of Sweden’s experience after the
Lehman Brother’s shock. During the global financial crisis, authorities provided over SEK 450 billion in liquidity
3
support to banks as global interbank funding and FX markets dislocated. The Riksbank used its FXR, and the
Swedish National Debt Office (SNDO) provided guarantees to certain institutions in order for them to issue foreign
currency debt themselves. Ultimately, FXR were replenished and increased via an FX swap line with the U.S. Federal
Reserve and foreign currency borrowing by the SNDO.
Limiting liquidity risk within banks is crucial. For example, building on recent progress in improving liquidity
standards (see Annex I), further progress towards a net stable funding ratio (NSFR), as well as improvements in the
macroprudential framework should help reduce the need for holding foreign currency reserves at the Riksbank.
However, given their size and wholesale dependence overall, Swedish banks will likely remain vulnerable to
sudden shortages of foreign liquidity, and some form of backstop seems appropriate.
International options are desirable but not certain. Ideally international coordination and support, such as
through official foreign exchange swap lines, would serve as a buffer and lower self-insurance needs. However, it is
uncertain under what conditions such liquidity support would be provided. During the global financial crisis, the
speed with which such arrangements were introduced and maintained, and their amounts differed among
countries.
Implementation. An important consideration is to what extent FX reserve needs should be met on a contingent
basis or be immediately in hand. Having reserves in hand entails a cost since as they are borrowed, and the returns
on reserves are not likely to compensate fully for the debt issuance. However, FX reserves provide insurance as the
funds are readily available, thereby strengthening the authorities’ ability in managing crisis. Additionally, this
approach lowers the risk that the cost of borrowing the funds during periods of stress may be higher compared to
more benign periods, as well as minimizes any lags between when needs arise and reserves are available. Similar
considerations apply to the extension of direct government guarantees for bank lending, which require time to
process and could introduce an explicit—and potentially adverse—feedback link between banks and the Swedish
sovereign.
Quantification. The Riksbank’s increased FXR need is broadly in line with severe but not impossible scenarios. The
scenarios were calculated based on banks’ consolidated balance sheets and focused on risks to euro and dollar
4
liquidity used to finance foreign currency assets. The results are broadly compatible with staff estimates of the
5
potential foreign liquidity needs of Sweden’s four largest banks. The approach assumes that tail risks materialize
in European financial markets, triggering a failure of banks’ to fund their foreign liquidity needs. The analysis
estimates that, contingent on such tail risk having realized, financing needs exceeding $55 billion could occur with
a probability of about 6 percent.

Box 5. Increasing Insurance against Banks’ Foreign Exchange Funding Exposures (Concluded)
Getting incentives right. Banks should share the
cost of this liquidity insurance. Fees on banks to at
least partially cover the cost of borrowed FX
reserves would help to reduce the burden on the
government and ultimately tax payers. They could
be linked to an individual bank’s FX funding
exposure, thus incentivizing a reduction in these
exposures. Other modalities could be considered
which will encourage banks to limit their liquidity
risks, such as FX reserve requirements or ratios.

1/ Range endpoints refer to the largest/smallest funding
gap, given the number of banks in need of liquidity
support, in any single year (2008–13). The marker refers to
the simple average over all 6 years. On average, only the
case in which 4 banks are in distress do the funding needs
exceed the reserves target.
4

The method starts with banks’ reported liquidity coverage ratios (LCRs) and implicit liquidity needs beyond the 30-day
window. Foreign funding swapped into local currency to fund SEK assets were excluded. The base case assumes that half of
banks’ most liquid assets are already used or are not convertible, that some of the Riksbank’s IMF commitment is used, that
banks cannot issue government-guaranteed debt, and that the Riksbank gets involved only after 30 days.
5

This analysis updates the liquidity gap approach used in the selected issues paper on reserve adequacy in the 2011 Article
IV staff report (Ishi, 2011, “Reserve Adequacy”, Attachment III in IMF Country Report No. 11/171). The approach calculates
probabilities of default for each bank, both in turn and jointly. Along with estimates of the liquidity gap, an average
expected funding gap for each scenario is derived given the number of banks in need of funding.

Box 6. Sweden’s Fiscal Framework1
The key elements of the Swedish budgetary policy framework are:
Surplus target for the general government. Introduced in 1997 with full effect from 2000, the target
states that the surplus in net lending shall be 1 percent of GDP over a business cycle. Setting a target that is to
be met over a business cycle is intended to prevent a pro-cyclical fiscal policy. Over the years, various
arguments have been used to motivate the surplus target and the weights attached to each argument have
changed. Debt reduction was highlighted in the early stages, followed later by demographic issues.



Central government expenditure ceiling. Introduced in 1997, the ceiling covers the primary
expenditures of the central government together with expenditure of the old age pension system. The ceiling,
set by Parliament on the basis of a government proposal in the Budget Bill, was used by the government on a
voluntary basis up to 2010. Since 2010, the government is required by law to propose an expenditure ceiling
for year t+3 in the Budget Bill for year t+1 (presented in the autumn of year t). For example, in the Budget Bill
for 2010 presented in the autumn of 2009, the government proposed a ceiling for 2012. The Swedish
Government is obliged by law to take necessary measures to ensure that actual expenditures do not exceed
the ceiling. The practice is that once a ceiling has been set, it should not be changed unless technically
motivated. This secures a medium-term planning horizon. It is possible to change set ceilings for nontechnical reasons, but this has only occurred twice and on both occasions the ceiling was lowered.



Buffers. Normally the ceiling is set to include a “budgeting” or “safety margin” that can be used for
expenditure arising from unforeseen cyclical factors. The government’s practice has been for the budgeting
margin to be at least 3 percent of forecast expenditure for year t+3, at least 2 percent for year t+2, at least 1.5
percent for year t+1, and at least 1 percent for the current budget year. The ceilings are set in nominal terms
(thus they are not adjusted for inflation, which imparts a trend consolidation of around ½ percentage point of
GDP annually, unless accounted for when setting the ceilings themselves).



Local government balanced budget requirements. To strengthen the budget process at the local level,
a balanced budget requirement for the local government sector has been in place since 2000. The
requirement means that each municipality and county council must budget for a balanced outcome and good
financial management in its activities.



Strict budget process. The surplus target and the expenditure ceiling set the total economic scope in
the budget process. The guiding principle is that expenditure increases within an area must be covered by
expenditure cuts within the same area. The draft budget must include all revenues and expenditures, as well
as other payments that affect the borrowing needs of the central government (the completeness principle).
Expenditures are to be reported on the expenditure side of the budget, while revenues are to be reported on
the revenue side of the budget.

Table 6. Sweden: Risk Assessment Matrix 1/
(Scale—high, medium, or low)
Source of Risks
Financial stress in the
euro area (EA) reemerges.

Relative Likelihood
Medium

Overall Level of Concern
Impact if Realized
Medium

2/

Swedish banks are directly
and indirectly (including
through their activity in other
Nordic economies) exposed
to the EA and reliant on
wholesale funding.

Bank losses and funding stress
could translate into curtailed
lending, with negative effects for
investment, consumption, and
growth.

Sweden is a small, very open
economy and its export
industry is tightly linked to EA
and global markets.
Policy response:
Protracted period of
slower European
growth.
Policy response:
Adverse house price
shock in Sweden (or
an interconnected
neighboring Nordic
country).

Reduce financial sector vulnerabilities; backstop bank liquidity, including
through the use of foreign currency liquidity buffers.
High
Sweden’s exports are tightly
linked to EA markets.

Medium
Household debt is high due
to easy access to credit, low
interest rates, and tax
incentives for housing.

Swedish banks are active
throughout the Nordic
region.

Reversal of safe-haven
flows.

Policy response:

As exports and income decline,
domestic demand will slow as
well, further reducing growth.

Revisit pace of planned fiscal consolidation; provide additional monetary
policy support.

Property prices remain
elevated.

Policy response:

Medium

Medium
The flow-on effect to
consumption and employment
will lower growth.
Rising non-performing loans and
bank funding costs could
translate into curtailed lending,
with negative effects on
investment.

Backstop bank liquidity, including through the use of foreign currency
liquidity buffers; provide fiscal and monetary support as needed.
Low
Excessive reversal of safehaven flows beyond a
normalization of market
conditions, including to
Sweden.

Medium
An excessive reversal of inflows
could result in premature
tightening of financial conditions,
potentially exacerbating domestic
risks (e.g., from a house price
correction).

Alleviate potential credit tightening by adjusting monetary conditions;
inject liquidity in financial markets where needed.

1/

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to
materialize in the view of the IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks
surrounding this baseline (“low is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and
30 percent, and “high” a probability of 30 percent or more). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall
level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities.
2/
In case the baseline does not materialize.

Annex I. Recent Financial Policy Initiatives1
In line with past staff advice (see Table on following pages), the authorities are engaged in a
number of policy measures to support financial stability:


Banks have been asked to increase capital buffers (e.g., major banks’ Core Tier I capital ratio
should be 10 percent or more from January 2013 and 12 percent or more from January 2015)
and address liquidity risks (e.g., implementing Basel III liquidity coverage ratios ahead of
time).



A maximum 85 percent loan-to-value ratio (LTV) for household mortgages was introduced in
October 2010 to improve mortgage quality.



Sweden’s Financial Supervisory Authority (FSA), after a consulting period with banks,
introduced minimum mortgage risk weights of 15 percent in May 2013.



Since its creation in mid-2012, the Riksbank and the FSA have held three meetings of the
Council for Cooperation on Macroprudential Policy (CCMP), in an attempt to foster
cooperation on the management of macrofinancial risks.



Major banks were requested to improve the transparency of their public reporting as regards
information on maturity information per type of asset and liability and per currency, as well
as on the degree of asset encumbrance.

Stability Council (FSC) with the participation of
Finansinspektionen (FI), the Minisitry of Finance (MoF), the
Riksbank (RB), and the Swedish National Debt Office. In
January 2012, the Council for Cooperation on

aggregated data on non-performing loans and
impairments (also divided by industry). For systemically
important banks (covering approximately 75 percent of the
Swedish financial sector), detailed data for the 25 largest
exposures at risk is collected and the individual credits are
discussed at quarterly risk meetings held with the banks.
From January 1, 2014, FI will require reporting from
financial institutions in accordance with the new reporting
format FINREP, which will further enhance the granularity
of the information. In addition, COREP-reporting (also to
be introduced January 1, 2014) will add the geographical
dimension. FI also reports on how and to what extent the
credit institutions during 2013 have adjusted to the
increased capital requirements and the effects on
households and companies. By the end of the year, FI will
report on measures to be taken to increase transparency of
lending rates and present an action plan on measures to
foster sound amortization, including amortization plans
and implementation.

1/ The Baseline is constructed from historical data on debt maturity, currency denomination of debt, and other characteristics of outstanding government debt. Projections are based on financing
needs and other related variables from reports of the Swedish National Debt Office and the Ministry of Finance. In the Historical scenario, real GDP growth, the real interest rate, and the primary
balance are set to historical averages. In the Constant Primary Balance scenario, the primary balance projection is kept constant at the 2013 Baseline proejction level. The Contingent Liability Shock
scenario considers a one-time increase in non-interest expenditures equivalent to 10 percent of banking sector assets. In turn, this results in adverse effects on real GDP growth, which is reduced by 2
standard deviations for 2 consecutive years. The revenue-to-GDP ratio remains unchanged relative to the baseline; the deterioration in the primary balance leads to an increase in the interst rate; and
the decline in growth results in lower inflation.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
September 5, 2013

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with Sweden
On August 30, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Sweden.1
Sweden recovered quickly from the Great Recession, leading much of the rest of Europe in
2010–11, but the economy has slowed more recently. Sweden faces a difficult external
environment with growth decelerating to below 1 percent in 2012 despite continued
monetary support and mildly expansionary fiscal policy. While the economy appears to have
stabilized, the overall growth trend has been one of moderation, partly reflecting cooling
activity abroad and Sweden’s tight trade and financial links with the rest of the Nordic region
and the euro area. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate remains elevated, reflecting cyclical
and structural weaknesses. Consumer price inflation has eased markedly below the 2-percent
target, primarily due to the strong krona amidst safe-haven flows, and the external balance
remains strongly in surplus.
Downside risks stem from financial fragilities and regional spillovers. Domestically,
household debt is high and rising, reflecting tax incentives, easy access to low-amortization
mortgages, and very low interest rates. As a consequence, a sudden and sizeable fall in
Swedish property prices could have a knock-on effect on consumption and unemployment,
with negative repercussions on banks through non-performing loans and funding costs.
Owing to the extensive activity of Sweden’s very large and concentrated banking sector in
Denmark, Finland, and Norway, this could have sizeable spillovers across the Nordic region.
At the same time, a sudden deterioration of household financial health elsewhere in the
region poses a risk to Sweden—as discussed in the Nordic Regional Report. A sudden and

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the
Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary
is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found
here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
severe re-intensification of the euro area crisis could impact banks as well, as would a large
reversal of safe-haven flows.
Reforms are under way to address many of these concerns. Financial reforms that have been
introduced include measures to increase capital and liquidity buffers and the introduction of
loan-to-value caps and a risk-weight floor for mortgages. However, banks remain heavily
dependent on wholesale funding and credit to households continues to expand, with
mortgage amortization low by international standards. Against this background and given
downside risks, the Riksbank boosted borrowed currency reserves to ensure ready access to
foreign currency liquidity. While the fiscal framework has served Sweden well and helped
reduce general government debt after the banking crisis in the early 1990s, the authorities are
examining ways to strengthen the framework to ensure both its countercyclicality and a
prudent borrowing capacity adequate for a country with a large financial sector.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors appreciated the additional context provided by the Nordic Regional
Report. They commended the Swedish authorities for their sound policy management,
including a supportive fiscal and monetary stance and ongoing financial reforms. However,
they noted that growth has slowed together with growth in Nordic and other European
trading partners, and risks remain tilted to the downside. High household debt and financial
fragilities pose important challenges, particularly given the large size of Sweden’s financial
sector and significant cross-Nordic linkages.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ focus on the financial stability agenda and commended
measures already taken to reduce vulnerabilities. They suggested a comprehensive but
gradual strategy to further improve the health of the banking system and household finances,
including measures to strengthen banks’ funding and liquidity positions and a phased-in
reduction of tax incentives to contain the buildup of household debt. Directors also
underscored the need for clear lines of responsibility for macroprudential policy and for
further progress toward a robust bank resolution framework, both domestically and in a
cross-border context.
Directors concurred that monetary policy should continue to be accommodative, assuming
household credit growth remains contained. They underscored that progress on the financial
stability agenda would allow monetary policy to focus on macroeconomic goals and would
reduce the need for foreign liquidity reserves and fiscal buffers.
Directors supported the moderately expansionary fiscal stance for 2013. They saw room for
additional stimulus if downside risks materialize, but emphasized the need to return to the 1
percent structural target when conditions warrant. Directors agreed that the existing fiscal
framework has served Sweden well and were encouraged by ongoing efforts to ensure its

3
countercyclicality. Many Directors saw merit in an explicit longer-term anchor for fiscal
policy, including a target debt range well below the Maastricht Treaty criterion of 60 percent
of GDP. This would ensure adequate room for the government to borrow, given the large
financial sector, the expected costs of aging and cyclical budget swings. A number of
Directors, however, advised caution in changing a well-functioning framework, and noted
that a target debt range would be difficult to determine and could give rise to moral hazard.
Directors recognized Sweden’s consistently high level of competitiveness but encouraged
additional reforms to further bolster potential growth. This should include continued
strengthening of the labor market by stimulating demand for young and foreign-born
workers, and relieving housing bottlenecks by increasing land supply and raising incentives
to invest in residential construction.

Statement by Pernilla Meyersson, Alternate Executive Director for Sweden
August 30, 2013
The Swedish authorities would like to thank IMF staff for the candid and constructive
policy discussions during the Article IV consultation with Sweden. The authorities
appreciate the comprehensive and in-depth analysis of the Swedish economy and broadly
agree with the main conclusions of the staff report.
Economic development
•

The authorities broadly share staff’s assessment of the economic developments in
Sweden and internationally. After the slowdown in the economy during 2012,
there are some positive signs in the Swedish economy. While GDP growth in the
second quarter of 2013 amounted to -0.1 percent (q/q), indicators suggest
increasing growth for the third quarter and GDP growth is expected to pick up
further in 2014 as the international environment improves.

•

The Consumer confidence indicator is at a historically normal level and
consumption is expected to grow at a normal rate whilst domestic investment
remains subdued in the coming quarters. The development in the labor market is
stable with slight increases in both employment and participation rates, implying
roughly unchanged unemployment rates over the recent past. Compared to precrisis levels, however, unemployment has increased by about two percentage
points. Resource utilization and the labor market are expected to improve in 2014.
Inflation is below target at 1.2 percent mainly as a result of reduced price markups and a strong krona. Inflation is expected to increase gradually to 2 percent
over the next few years. The repo rate is at 1 percent and the Riksbank’s repo rate
path indicates that it will remain at this low level for around a year.

•

The authorities also agree with staff that the current policy mix is appropriate
given the economic development and that there is room for additional monetary
and fiscal stimulus, should downside risks to the economy materialize.

Monetary policy
•

The Riksbank agrees with staff that considerable uncertainties about the outlook
remain. The situation in the euro area is fragile and a re-intensification of the
crisis could have spillover effects on Sweden both through exports and through
the banking system. In such a situation, the repo rate path may need to be
lowered. At the same time, if household credit growth were to increase to
unsustainable levels the repo rate path might have to be increased beyond what
macroeconomic and inflationary considerations would warrant in the short run.

• Staff raises the issue of house prices and household debt in monetary policy
decisions. As noted by staff, the Riksbank’s monetary policy is currently
accommodative. With inflation around one percentage point below target and the
real economy recovering slowly, further repo-rate cuts could in principle be
contemplated. However, high debt levels and high house prices may jeopardize

2
macroeconomic stability in the longer term and could also have long lasting
negative effects on inflation. The Executive Board of the Riksbank therefore
needs to take such longer-term risks into account when making the repo-rate
decisions. Having said this, the Riksbank agrees with staff that macroprudential
policy should be the first line of defense for preventing imbalances in house prices
and indebtedness.
Financial stability, macroprudential policy and financial reforms
•

The authorities share staff’s view that ensuring financial stability is key.
Important steps have already been taken and further strengthening of financial
stability will be on top of the agenda in the coming years.

•

The authorities emphasize their commitment to make further progress on an
appropriate macroprudential policy system.

•

The authorities agree with staff’s assessment that Sweden’s large banking system
remains a potential vulnerability for financial stability, especially in combination
with the high levels of household debt. The Swedish banking sector is dependent
on international wholesale funding markets, and therefore, a re-intensification of
the euro area crisis remains a risk that could spill over to banks particularly in the
form of a shortage of foreign currency liquidity. Because of the high levels of
household debt, a fall in domestic house prices could lead to negative effects on
the real economy, particularly through a negative effect on consumption. As
stated in the assessment, such developments could also possibly push up bank
funding costs and non-performing loans. In this context it should be noted that the
Swedish banks are well capitalized on a risk-weighted basis, giving them a buffer
if risks were to materialize. Swedish authorities have also strengthened the capital
requirements for Swedish banks. First, by accelerating the implementation of the
Basel III capital requirements, and later by establishing minimum requirements
for risk weights on Swedish mortgages.

•

The authorities agree with staff’s view that the high level of household debt is a
cause for concern. Recently the FSA increased risk weights on mortgages and,
going forward, further increasing risk weights for mortgages could be one way to
temper growth in household debt.

•

The authorities agree with staff’s assessment that the liquidity risks should be
reduced. Important steps have, however, already been taken in this direction in the
form of the early implementation of LCR by the FSA both in aggregate as well as
separately in euro and US dollar, applicable from January 2013. To further push
banks in the right direction, the Riksbank introduced a recommendation in its
latest financial stability report that the Swedish banks should publish their NSFR
at least every quarter.

•

The authorities agree with the staff’s assessment that a robust bank resolution
framework could help to reduce potential spillovers in case of financial crises.
Developments in the Nordea Crisis Management Group as well as in the Bank

3
Recovery and Resolution Directive are important improvements. As regards a
potential Banking Union membership, Sweden participates actively in the
discussions, but there are fundamental issues that remain to be agreed upon.
Consideration of a potential membership can take place when all the rules are in
place.
•

The authorities agree with staff that a clear allocation of responsibility and
mechanisms for coordination between the relevant authorities would be needed to
ensure an effective macroprudential policy framework. Moreover, the authorities
are of the view that any institutional arrangement should be designed in a way that
takes into account the need for adequate democratic accountability. In this spirit,
with a view to ensure a well-functioning coordination of macroprudential policy,
the Government has recently announced a proposal on the establishment of a
Financial Stability Council with representatives from the Ministry of Finance, the
FSA, the Swedish National Debt Office and the Riksbank. Further, the
government has proposed that the FSA be equipped with the primary
responsibility for the implementation of macroprudential tools. Regarding the
implementation of macroprudential tools, the authorities share staff’s view that
the approach should be gradual and take due account of the effects on the real
economy.

Fiscal development and structural reforms
Fiscal stance
•

Sweden’s sound public finances have made it possible to meet the international
downturn with expansionary measures, while preserving confidence and
safeguarding the surplus target.

•

The Ministry of Finance broadly agrees with staff’s view of Sweden’s fiscal
stance, even though the Ministry’s assessment of the structural balance and the
output gap in the near term is noticeably higher. As is pointed out by staff,
Sweden’s fiscal position is fundamentally strong which allows for continued
injections into the economy in the short term without jeopardizing either long-run
sustainability or the ability to respond properly, should downside risks
materialize.

•

As opposed to many other European countries, Sweden’s strong fiscal position
has enabled the government to present budgets with expansionary measures in
both 2012 and 2013. According to the authorities’ assessment, there is still a clear
need to support the economic recovery by taking an expansionary policy stance
also in 2014.

•

Future reform efforts will continue to focus on structurally warranted reforms that
strengthen Sweden’s long-term growth prospects by increasing employment,
decreasing structural unemployment and increasing social cohesion. Expansionary
fiscal policy in the current juncture is consistent with the fiscal framework. The
surplus target allows for active stabilization policy when resource utilization is

4
below normal levels and the return to the target level should, in the absence of any
new negative shocks to the economy, be undertaken gradually with the closing of
the output gap.
Contingent liabilities, fiscal buffers and a long-term anchor for fiscal policy
•

As staff points out, the Swedish fiscal framework has been serving Sweden well
in the present down-turn. The surplus target has helped bring down the public
debt to low levels and enhance the credibility of fiscal policy.

•

The authorities acknowledge staff’s opinion on the importance of retaining
appropriately large fiscal buffers and find the discussion on the link between
contingent liabilities and fiscal buffers important. However, as is shown by the
large range in the staff’s assessment of a possible debt limit, it should be noted
that it is always difficult to make a precise estimation ex ante of the potential
fiscal costs of a banking crisis. Moreover, there is a risk that explicitly linking
fiscal targets to contingent liabilities could lead to moral hazard. Therefore, the
authorities agree with staff’s recommendation that strong financial market
policies are the first-best response to protect against such fiscal risks.

•

The authorities find that the discussion on introducing an explicit long-term
anchor for fiscal policy should depart from the premise of preserving the surplus
target. The latest evaluation of the surplus target (Ds 2010:4) dissuaded from
introducing an explicit debt target, notably since public debt is affected by other
factors beyond net lending and would decrease the effectiveness of fiscal policy.

Counter-cyclicality of the fiscal framework
•

According to staff there are indications that fiscal policy has become less sensitive
to the business cycle since the mid-2000s. It is the authorities’ view that the fiscal
policy framework does not give rise to pro-cyclicality and that it gives ample
room to counteract downturns with discretionary measures. The construction of
the surplus target allows net lending to fall when the economy slows and vice
versa. Since it is a forward- looking target, discretionary measures are also
consistent with the framework as the surplus target does not demand temporary
deviations from the target level to be made up for by running corresponding
surpluses, provided that the long-term sustainability of public finances is not
threatened. The authorities would also like to underline that the estimates of the
discretionary responsiveness of fiscal policy to the cycle from aggregate timeseries, especially in the presence of a short sample period and extreme outliers,
are associated with large uncertainty.

•

In 2008-2009 there were considerable concerns about a protracted and even
deeper recession that would imply large deficits. This called for retaining some
fiscal room for maneuver. However, the effect on public finances turned out to be
much smaller than expected as the fall in GDP mainly depended on a drop in
external demand. In addition, output gaps widened to an extent that could not
reasonably be fully counteracted by a weakening of net lending. Moreover, during

5
these years there was a substantial downward shift in expenditure due to the
reforms of the labor market and the social insurance system that had been
undertaken since 2006. This shift on the expenditure side, occurring at the same
time as the downturn, upheld the level of net lending and is therefore likely to
have concealed the automatic stabilizing effect of public expenditure. Going
forward, corresponding benign effects on public finances are not to be expected,
which calls for vigilance as regards the relationship between public finances and
the cycle. All in all, the factors mentioned above created an ex post impression of
a weak relation between discretionary policy and the cycle. The fiscal policy
conducted during the 2008-2009 recession is therefore not readily comparable to
the period prior to the crisis.
•

It should also be noted that while the size of the public sector in relation to GDP
has decreased somewhat in recent years, the introduction of the in-work tax credit
has increased the progressivity of the tax system. In the Swedish context, it is also
important to take into account the extensive use of semi-automatic stabilizers in
the form of active labor market policies as an effective stabilization policy
instrument. In addition, a proposal to reduce the risk of pro-cyclicality in local
governments’ finances was recently passed by Parliament, allowing them to use a
portion of their surplus from good times to cover deficits incurred as a result of a
recession. Moreover, the government has proposed a system of state support for
short-time working schemes that can be deployed swiftly during a particularly
serious crisis.

Facilitating structural change
•

The authorities agree that further reforms are warranted to boost Sweden’s growth
potential. The government is looking closely at developments in the housing
market and has taken measures to increase incentives for construction, to foster a
more efficient use of the existing housing stock and to make planning and zoning
processes more efficient.

•

With respect to the labor market, important steps have been taken to increase
demand and improve training and education for jobs, in particular for vulnerable
groups. Such groups include the young and foreign-born that face the risk of
becoming long-term unemployed. Further steps are necessary to increase
employment and reduce structural unemployment. Since 2011 the Government
has engaged in talks with the social partners about how the labor market could
become more inclusive and flexible. These talks are now beginning to yield
concrete results. A number of vocational introduction agreements have been
signed and a proposal for state support to vocational introduction agreements will
be presented in the Budget Bill.
