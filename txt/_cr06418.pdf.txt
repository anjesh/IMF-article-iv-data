INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
REPUBLIC OF ESTONIA
Staff Report for the 2006 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by Staff Representatives for the 2006 Consultation with the Republic of Estonia
Approved by Alessandro Leipold and G. Russell Kincaid
November 1, 2006
Executive Summary
Background: After several years of rapid growth the economy is now hitting capacity
constraints. Low interest rates, rising confidence in the wake of EU accession, and robust
external demand have lifted GDP growth above 10 percent. To date, growth has been
supported by productivity increases (maintaining competitiveness) and by a surge in
employment (bringing unemployment to a record low). But there is clear evidence of
overheating: rising core inflation, a wide external current account deficit and rapid, largely
foreign-funded, credit growth. Rising incomes and cheap credit have also fueled a real estate
boom. Inflation, though not high for a converging economy, exceeds the Maastricht reference
value, delaying euro adoption.
Outlook: Growth is projected to ease in 2007–08 as capacity constraints bite and as rising
interest rates and private sector debt contain domestic demand. If demand does not slow as
expected, however, continued rapid credit growth and a widening current account deficit
could increase the risk of a hard landing. In any case, overheating pressures and convergence
effects will make it difficult to meet the Maastricht inflation criterion in the next two years.
The overheating calls for a tight fiscal stance but the authorities found this to be difficult in
light of the existing surplus, the stepping-up of EU-supported spending, and the political
calendar. Nonetheless the current procyclical stance is inappropriate and raises, rather than
lowers, macroeconomic risks. The budget framework should also be strengthened.
Rapid credit growth has financed high rates of investment but its pace has also created large
potential risks. Estonia’s regional financial integration limits the authorities’ ability to
influence banks’ risk management or the pace of credit growth. This puts a premium on
supervisory vigilance and close cooperation with supervisors in Nordic countries.
Euro adoption remains a key objective but the authorities have limited tools to reduce
inflation below the Maastricht threshold. The best approach would be to use restrictive fiscal
policy and the timing of excise increases to position the economy for euro entry when
exogenous price developments turn favorable. The risks from some delay should be small
given the robust currency board arrangement, but an open-ended delay should be avoided.

I. BACKGROUND
1.
Estonia’s commitment to free markets and prudent financial policies has paid
off handsomely. Far-reaching structural reforms created a well-functioning market economy,
well integrated with the Baltic and EU regions. Labor and product markets are flexible; the
banking sector is almost entirely in the hands of reputable regional banking groups; and the
business climate is among the most highly rated in the region. Prudent macroeconomic
policies, broadly consistent with IMF advice (Box 1), have brought price stability and low
public debt. These policies have borne fruit with impressive productivity growth and a
corresponding rise in per capita income (Figure 1). The task facing the authorities now—and
the challenge facing the government to be formed after the March 2007 parliamentary
elections—is to sustain this performance while addressing the overheating risks associated
with full employment.
Box 1. Article IV Fund Policy Advice Implementation
Estonia has had an excellent working relationship with the IMF since becoming a member in May 1992.1
Most Fund policy advice has been taken on board and its implementation has been characterized by a
high degree of ownership, which has proven to be key to Estonia’s economic success. In recent years,
however, Estonia’s fiscal policy has been more expansionary than advised by the Fund.

A Decade of Cooperation,” by Adalbert Knoebl and Richard Haas, IMF WP/03/241.

2.
GDP growth rose above 10 percent in 2005 amid signs of overheating and is
expected to continue at about the same rate—above estimated potential—in 2006
(Table 1).1 Strong exports were the motor of the 2005 acceleration while consumption lagged
behind income. In the first half of 2006 the demand mix reversed: consumption growth

gathered pace, responding to income growth and record-high consumer confidence following
EU accession, but net exports declined as surging imports overwhelmed still-strong export
growth. Staff calculations suggest that the economy is operating well above potential, an
assessment borne out by tight labor markets and rising inflation in nontradeables.
3.
Demand pressures and rapid productivity growth have produced strong wage
increases and large employment gains. The unemployment rate, which had been stuck at
about 10 percent for two years, fell below 8 percent in 2005 and labor shortages emerged in a
number of sectors, notably construction and health care. Labor markets tightened further in
2006, when strong employment demand was filled largely by retirees and discouraged
workers drawn back into the labor force by higher wages. The competition for labor, and the
upward pressure on wages, has been intensified by expanded job opportunities in other EU
economies. Labor’s share in value added eased in the past two years, however, suggesting
that productivity has kept pace with real wages.

above the euro area average. The economy’s high energy intensity exposes it to oil and fuel
price increases, which gave a further impulse to inflation in the last year. That impulse is
now waning, but is being replaced by rising nontradables inflation—a symptom of
overheating. Average annual inflation therefore remained between 4 and 4½ percent in 2006
prompting the authorities to postpone their target date for euro adoption from 2007 (the date
planned upon joining ERM II).
5.
Estonia’s economic growth has supported—and been supported by—rapid
credit growth, financed increasingly by resource transfers from Nordic banking groups
to Estonian affiliates. Banks’ intense competition for market share has driven nominal
interest rates to levels similar to those in Nordic markets. The low interest rates—negative in
real terms—and exuberant expectations have raised bank credit growth to the nonfinancial
private sector above 60 percent per year (Figure 2). The bulk of the new lending was linked
to the real estate sector where it contributed to rapid price increases, especially in late 2005.
Nonetheless, the stock of private sector credit remains well below euro area averages
(Figure 3). Recent developments, including rising euro interest rates, a possible pause in the
property boom, and rising debt burdens are likely to slow credit growth from its current
torrid pace. Nonetheless, credit can be expected to grow robustly over the medium term as
financial deepening and convergence continue (Box 2).
Box 2. Financial Deepening and Real Convergence
Financial deepening in Estonia over the last decade was associated with significant real
convergence in living standards to the European Union average–indeed, Estonia has achieved more
real convergence than other new member states for a given amount of financial deepening. As
convergence proceeds, bank credit is likely to continue growing rapidly, particularly given the
limited development of other financial markets in Estonia. Demand for residential mortgages in
particular could remain strong since dwelling sizes and the quality of the housing stock are well
below European averages, pointing to an unfilled demand for new or refurbished housing.

Foreign-funded credit growth and foreign direct investment have been the
counterparts of large current account deficits. Foreign savings, recently in the range of
10-12 percent of GDP, have supported high rates of investment and some consumption
smoothing. External liabilities have risen accordingly: Estonia’s negative net external
investment position now equals annual output, although three-quarters of this is equity
stemming from foreign direct investment. In recent years gross external debt has also risen
significantly and now stands at 85 percent of GDP, most of it owed by banks to their parent
groups (Tables 3 and 5). Net debt stands at almost 30 percent of GDP (Figure 4).
7.
External competitiveness appears adequate although recent trends call for close
monitoring. Overall, the share of industry in total output has increased, suggesting that high
120
120
profitability is drawing resources into the
tradeables sector. Indeed, export volume
110

growth accelerated to nearly 20 percent in
2004–05, bringing further increases in
100

Estonia’s world market share (Figure 5).

overall income—which is inversely related
to profitability—has been broadly stable during the last five years, it has risen during the last
year relative to partner countries, suggesting that the competitive environment is becoming
more demanding. Moreover, the pace of technological upgrading in Estonia may have
slowed in recent years.2

The general government balance is expected to show a sixth consecutive surplus
in 2006. Despite an initially balanced budget for 2006, staff projects a surplus of nearly
2 percent of GDP. This better-than-expected outturn is the net effect of higher-than-budgeted
revenues (a more than 3 percent of GDP overperformance, reflecting buoyant economic
activity and improved tax compliance) and a supplementary budget that allows much of the
unbudgeted revenue to be spent. In September, the government approved a draft
supplementary 2006 budget with a 1.2 percent of GDP surplus and a draft 2007 budget with a
surplus equivalent to 0.8 percent of staff-projected GDP.

the flexible labor market should ease
the adjustment to slower growth. Inflation should slow in 2007–08 on account of lower fuel
prices but could remain above the Maastricht reference criterion, jeopardizing the timetable
for euro adoption. Looking forward, with the attainment of full employment and greater
possibilities for emigration, growth in the medium term could become increasingly
constrained by the scarcity of labor (Table 4).
10.
This outlook is subject to risks whose avoidance was the focus of the discussions.
A main risk is that demand does not ease as expected. Overly optimistic expectations could
lead to continued consumption growth, reignite the real estate market, extend the credit
boom, and slow the decline in the current account deficit. Further increases in the prices of
nontradables would draw resources from the tradeables sector, and keep inflation high,
extending the delay in euro adoption. Meanwhile, growing labor shortages could push wage
growth above productivity gains, undermining competitiveness. In sum, the vulnerabilities
embedded in households’ balance-sheets would deepen, exposing the economy to shocks
such as a correction in real estate prices or a deterioration in the external environment. Staff
and the authorities agreed to focus the present consultation on policy measures to mitigate
these risks, and to take up medium-term challenges with the 2007 consultation. Accordingly,
discussions focused on overheating, euro adoption and credit growth.
B. Policy Responses to Overheating
11.
The authorities agreed that fiscal tightening was the only available
macroeconomic instrument to address overheating but felt that the scope for further
tightening—and also the payoff—was limited. The scope was limited by the fact that the
fiscal position was already very strong compared, for example, with other EU countries.
Indeed gross debt would, in 2007, fall below the Maastricht deficit ceiling. Moreover, the
authorities had already created a fiscal cushion—there was a comfortable stabilization fund
and Pillar I pensions had been prefunded through 2010 at least. As for the payoff, they noted

14
that, given the openness of the economy, the fiscal stance would have only a small impact on
aggregate demand or inflation. Thus, while the authorities did plan to resist pressure for
excessive spending, they found it difficult to justify large surpluses—particularly in an
election year. They nonetheless undertook to seek ways to limit fiscal pressure on domestic
resources. Staff suggested that expenditures with high import content could be favored, while
expenditures falling on sectors where overheating pressures were greatest, such as
construction, could be candidates for postponement.
12.
The staff welcomed the effort to resist election year spending pressures but
emphasized that the proposed budgets were expansionary. The proposed supplementary

pressures start to build. Staff also pointed out that increased expenditures financed by EU
grants delivered fiscal stimulus even though they did not increase the measured deficit. The
timing is unfortunate since the spending is coming on stream just when a fiscal withdrawal
was needed. The planned 1 percentage point per year cut in income tax rates during 2007–09
would also come at an inopportune time.
13.
The authorities emphasized that rising EU-funded expenditures made it difficult
to impart a contractionary fiscal impulse. “Sterilizing” the expansionary impact of EUrelated spending by cutting expenditures elsewhere would be unacceptable to the Estonian
public. Postponing EU-funded projects was also problematic: given the deadlines for using
EU funds, there was no guarantee that expenditures could be postponed long enough to
situate them at a more appropriate phase of the cycle. Moreover, much of the expenditure
was on infrastructure needed to secure long-term growth.
14.
With labor shortages pushing wages up across a wide range of skills, staff
suggested that consideration be given to easing restrictions on importing labor. The
authorities noted that Estonia had no restrictions on inflows of labor from European Union
members, but they were concerned that using low-cost labor from other countries could
prolong Estonia’s reliance on declining low-wage sectors. They felt it would be better to
encourage a shift to more high-technology, high-value-added sectors such as
communications or information technology, and accordingly planned to ease restrictions for
skilled labor. The authorities were also concerned about the political and social implications

15
of large-scale immigration. The staff nonetheless suggested that, to help address overheating,
restrictions could be eased so as to allow a broader spectrum of workers to enter cyclically
tight sectors.
15.
The mission also reviewed preparations for a medium-term budgetary
framework (MTBF) (Box 3). Staff welcomed the progress so far in implementing the
framework, which builds upon FAD technical assistance. A MTBF would provide better
control over aggregate spending, subject spending programs to improved review and costing,
and improve allocation by linking strategic planning to the budget.
Box 3: Estonia’s MTBF
The Ministry of Finance produces a State Budget Strategy (SBS) for government approval every year. The
SBS sets out a macroeconomic and fiscal framework, including expenditure priorities and ministry-level
expenditure ceilings, for the budget year and three subsequent years. It was strengthened in 2006 by
introducing a new strategic planning system and program classification of expenditures. Staff views the SBS as
a sound basis for an MTBF and made recommendations on coverage, improving out-year estimates,
simplifying strategic planning, and strengthening the role of the MTBF in the policy debate.

C. Euro Adoption
16.
The authorities continue to view euro adoption as a key policy priority. In their
view, shared by the staff, euro adoption would lock in the benefits from the currency board
arrangement (CBA) (financial and economic integration with the EU, and a stable and
predictable policy framework) and remove the residual risks, however small, associated with
having a separate currency. They emphasized that the fourteen-year track record of growth
and financial probity under the strictures of the CBA, including the bounce-back after the
1998 Russia crisis, was evidence of the flexibility in labor and product markets needed to
thrive under a common currency. And they were confident that competitiveness remained
adequate.
17.
On timing, the authorities did not see a two or three-year delay as problematic.

market spreads, which are negligible, did not change perceptibly. Staff agreed that some
delay would be manageable but stressed that overheating and convergence-related factors
(such as the Balassa-Samuelson effect) could keep inflation above the Maastricht reference
value for a protracted period. This would weaken one pillar of Estonia’s CBA, a clear exit
strategy. It would therefore be prudent to maintain a policy stance that would position the
economy for euro entry as soon as external conditions turned favorable.
Box 4. Estonia: Inflation Projections
Staff’s baseline projection, assuming current policies, suggests that Estonia will not meet the Maastricht
inflation criterion before end-2008 unless there are beneficial shocks. But postponing excise tax increases (now
planned for January 2008) or advancing them could bring inflation below the reference value in the second half
of 2008.

18.
The authorities agreed but noted that their policy options were limited. Given the
CBA, the main macroeconomic instrument was fiscal policy which would have only a small
impact on prices in a small open economy such as Estonia’s. Thus even a strongly
contractionary stance might not bring inflation down by enough, particularly if inflation was
well above the Maastricht threshold. Nonetheless, as mentioned above, they would explore
the possibility of shifting expenditures away from the nontraded sector which has become a
significant contributor to inflation. Another instrument was the timing of planned excise
increases, some of which are covered by commitments to the EU. Earlier this year one set of
increases had been postponed from July 2006 to January 2008 in order to improve the
chances of meeting the Maastricht criterion in 2007. Staff noted that, in view of new, higher,
inflation projections, a case could now be made for making these increases in late 2006—the
effect on inflation would then peak in late 2007 when the Maastricht target would be, in any
event, out of reach. But the authorities felt that the timing could not be fine-tuned since the
coalition agreement and (in their view) best practice precluded increasing any tax without a
6-month warning. Moreover, too rapid an increase could lead to a fall in revenue because of
lower excises abroad. The authorities also planned to hold further discussions with EU
institutions in an effort to seek an interpretation of the Maastricht inflation criterion that
would be better suited to conditions in a rapidly converging economy.
D. Rapid Credit Growth
19.
Discussions focused on how to ensure that the risks associated with rapid credit
growth are well assessed and properly priced. In addition, staff reviewed changes in bank
supervision since the 1999 FSAP and discussed the challenges facing the Financial
Supervisory Authority (Box 5).3
20.
The FSA sees its main challenge as ensuring that banks’ management—at
parent institutions as well as local affiliates—are alive to the risks in a profitable but
still immature market. Since all the major banks are affiliates of reputable Nordic banking
groups, and since their financial performance has been exemplary, the risks might appear
minor, but the authorities did not consider them so. First, the loan market was immature: loan
portfolios had grown under exceptionally benign circumstances—expanding opportunities
for investment, fast-growing incomes, and declining interest rates—which had led to nearzero default ratios and exceptionally high profits (Table 5). It was possible that lenders and
borrowers were both overestimating borrowers’ capacity to repay under less favorable
circumstances. Second, the major banking groups’ Estonian exposure is relatively small but
highly profitable. This has led to aggressive competition for market share and short-term
incentives—not always resisted—to relax credit standards. Moreover, with risk assessments

3

The authorities propose to schedule an FSAP update in late 2008.

18
Box 5. Bank Supervision in Estonia
Estonia’s supervisory system was reshaped in 2002 when supervision was transferred from the Bank of
Estonia to the new Financial Supervisory Authority (FSA), which was made responsible for all regulated
financial intermediaries. In 2005 the FSA was reorganized on a functional basis in order to increase its
effectiveness and make better use of its limited resources. The FSA is currently preparing for the
adoption of Basel II. Keeping up with the large volume of new regulations, including from the EU, is a
significant burden for this small institution.
Because the larger banks, and most of the smaller ones, are affiliates of regional groups, the FSA
normally plays the subordinate role of host supervisor. This has required setting up a network of
arrangements with other supervisors. Cooperation is reportedly good, facilitated by the relationships
supervisory authorities maintain in the Nordic region. Supervisors meet regularly to discuss work
programs. They also participate in each others’ onsite work and exchange information derived from
offsite work. These issues are being explored further by the Fund’s Nordic-Baltic Regional Financial
Sector project.

increasingly made at head offices it was not clear that credit standards were well-tailored to
local conditions. Third, banks were heavily exposed to the booming real estate sector where
rising prices had led to an erosion of income cover and to longer maturities. Overall, the
authorities viewed the real estate-related risk—which could be triggered by a collapse of
prices or a significant growth slowdown—as the greatest source of concern.
21.
But they noted that, so long as there was no visible asset deterioration, they had
few tools to influence banks’ risk management or the pace of credit growth. A doubling
of the risk weights on mortgages (to 100 percent) in March 2006 had had little impact on the
growth of mortgage lending but did make banks create larger buffers against credit risk by
bringing funds from abroad. Both the modest increase in reserve requirements (from 13 to
15 percent) effective September 2006 and efforts at moral suasion had mainly a signaling
role. The scope for regulatory measures with more teeth was limited since banks could avoid
regulation—and supervision—by booking loans abroad or transforming subsidiaries into
branches. The main instrument available was thus to use supervisory interventions to ensure
that banks were fully aware of the risks, including mismatches in households’ balance
sheets.4 Along these lines, the FSA had placed real estate lending under particular scrutiny,
requiring banks to provide detailed quarterly reports and a biannual questionnaire. The staff
agreed that Estonia’s financial integration limited the scope for further regulatory measures,
or, for that matter, more intrusive, nonmarket measures.5 This put a premium on strong

4

5

Balance sheet risks are discussed in an accompanying selected issues paper.

The regulatory environment is already relatively tough: the new risk weight on mortgages is twice as high as
set out in the EU’s Capital Adequacy Directive and higher than in the other Baltic countries; and reserve
requirements were higher than in the other Baltics even before the recent increase. Like other countries in the
region, Estonia has steered clear of non-market measures to limit credit growth or capital inflows.

19
prudential supervision, and staff encouraged the FSA to press banks to make their stress tests
more probing by analyzing more varied and more severe shocks.
22.
The staff (like the central bank) also urged the government to reduce or
eliminate fiscal incentives which could fuel the property boom and were also
distortionary. The authorities responded that they intended to reduce the ceiling on the
mortgage interest deduction by 40 percent, though this would only become effective in 2008.
In other areas there was less readiness for change—there were no plans to increase property
taxes and the authorities said it would be difficult to tighten the administration of capital
gains taxation given the exemption of owners’ primary residences.
E. Medium-Term Issues
23.
While discussions focused on short-term issues it was agreed that flexibility and
productivity growth were key to containing medium-term risks. In light of the poor
demographic prospects and fiercer competition from abroad, productivity improvements
were essential to growth. In particular, it would be important to align the educational system
to the changing needs of enterprises and foster an environment supportive of research and
development. To meet these challenges the authorities have introduced education and
technology programs described in their Action Plan for Jobs and Growth for implementing
the Lisbon Strategy. Labor and product market flexibility should also be preserved in order
to support continued competitiveness gains. Flexibility and growth should both ease the
adjustment necessary to shrink the external imbalance and stabilize the ratio of external
obligations to national income. Staff estimates that if growth settles at 5-6 percent as
projected in the staff’s medium term macroeconomic framework the needed adjustment
could be manageable—about 5 percentage points of GDP. But under more unfavorable
assumptions it could be as high as 8-10 percentage points of GDP.6
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
24.
After a decade and a half of rapid convergence, Estonia’s very success is
creating new challenges. While growth is strong and competitiveness adequate, burgeoning
demand is putting pressure on wages and prices that could undermine competitiveness and
thus the foundation of sustained rapid growth. The blistering pace of credit growth may be
compromising banks’ assessment and pricing of risk. And inflation, while moderate, remains
stubbornly above the Maastricht reference value, delaying euro adoption. The institutions
that have underpinned Estonia’s outstanding performance to date—flexible product and labor
markets and an excellent investment climate—should help ride out these challenges by
6

Debt projections show gross external debt ratio rising by nearly 10 percentage points of GDP by 2011, while
“bounds tests” show increases in the order of 15 percentage points (Table 7). However, the current account
deficit is projected to shrink to well below the level that stabilizes the debt ratio.

20
sustaining productivity-driven growth. But a countercyclical fiscal stance is needed to
improve the odds for a soft landing and early euro adoption, and continued supervisory
vigilance is needed to contain risks in the financial sector.
25.
While six years of surpluses testify to Estonia’s commitment to fiscal probity,
overheating pressures and the wide external current account deficit call for a tighter
fiscal stance. The surpluses planned for 2006 and 2007 are welcome but too small, implying
a procyclical fiscal position. It would have been preferable to save all of the revenue
overperformance in 2006, postpone programmed income tax cuts, and make the 2007 budget
at least neutral on a cyclically adjusted basis. Better still would have been to take advantage
of exceptionally strong economic growth to reduce the share of government expenditure in
GDP, positioning the budget for future challenges such as the costs of an aging population.
26.
The macroeconomic impact of EU funds needs to be taken into account in
budget planning. Estonia’s effective procedures for allocating structural funds have resulted
in a rapid uptake, setting a standard for countries in the region. But, while EU projects will
contribute to growth, they are also providing fiscal stimulus at a time when withdrawal is
needed. This dilemma has no easy solution, as the authorities noted, but it does need to be
addressed within the broader context of the budget. In setting priorities and timing the
authorities will need to take into account the impact on demand, particularly in sectors—such
as construction—where overheating is most pronounced. In addition, consideration could be
given to attracting more competitive bids by easing conditions for contractors to make wider
use of imported labor.
27.
The reluctance to take a countercyclical fiscal stance underscores the need to
strengthen the budget framework. Given the CBA and, in time, euro adoption, fiscal
policy is the only instrument available for macroeconomic stabilization. Thus, at a minimum,
automatic stabilizers should be allowed full play. A medium-term goal should therefore be to
shift the focus of policy from targeting the fiscal balance to targeting medium term
expenditure growth, allowing the fiscal balance to reflect the business cycle. A full-fledged
medium-term expenditure framework will take time to implement, but the authorities can
already start placing increased emphasis on expenditures. An important first step would be to
end the practice of using supplementary budgets to spend cyclical increases in revenues.
28.
Euro adoption at an early date should be a key objective. Estonia’s readiness for
the euro is indicated by its sustained strong performance under the nearly identical rigors of
the CBA. The euro will lock in the benefits of the CBA and eliminate balance sheet risks
associated with a separate currency. These risks are not large but they are increasing with
growing external debt and currency mismatches. Some delay in euro adoption would be
easily manageable, as has been shown by markets’ unruffled response to a perceived two to
three year postponement, but a longer or open-ended delay should be avoided. A clearly
articulated strategy for euro adoption would also send a signal of Estonia’s continued
commitment to financial stability.

21
29.
Meeting the Maastricht inflation criterion will require getting the maximum
effect from a limited set of instruments. A tight fiscal posture, with particular attention to
containing demand in the overheating construction sector, is the indispensable ingredient.
The timing of planned excise increases will also have a major impact on the time path of
inflation but involves a difficult judgment call. If the inflation threshold looks likely to
remain out of reach in the near future, consideration could be given to increasing excises
now. But if the recent drop in oil prices persists, bringing the inflation threshold within reach
earlier, there would be a stronger case for maintaining the current calendar—though
supported by a much tighter fiscal stance than is now contemplated. The government that
takes office in early 2007 will need to make this assessment at the beginning of its mandate.
30.
The openness of the financial sector puts a premium on supervisory vigilance
and cross-border cooperation. Openness has brought major benefits, including an inflow of
foreign savings intermediated by reputable regional banks. But it has also limited the
authorities’ ability to influence bank behavior by regulation. Against this background, the
authorities’ supervisory effort is appropriately focused on risks stemming from rapid credit
growth, particularly in the real estate sector. To maximize effectiveness, the existing links
with Nordic supervisors should be maintained and, if possible, strengthened. The objective
should be to ensure that the foreign-owned banks are fully alert to the risks associated with
their Estonian operations. Finally, although the property boom seems to have paused, the
case remains strong for eliminating mortgage interest deductibility and other distortionary
fiscal incentives for real estate investment.
31.
It is recommended that the Article IV consultation with Estonia remain on the
standard 12-month cycle.

1/ Banks must meet reserve requirements on the basis of average reserve holdings over each reporting period.
End-of-period levels can, therefore, be below required reserves. Starting in January 2001, up to
3 percentage points of the 13 percent reserve requirement could be met with high quality euro-denominated
foreign instruments. In July 2001, the ceiling on the foreign share was raised to 50 percent. Effective
September 2006, the reserve requirement was raised to 15 percent.
2/ Defined as loans overdue by 30–150 days. Under current regulations all non-performing loans over
150 days are written off.
3/ Defined as the ratio of total liabilities to total capital; a decline in the ratio indicates improvement.

APPENDIX II. RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
1.
Estonia became a member of the World Bank on June 23, 1992. The World Bank’s
early involvement in Estonia included work on public expenditure issues (1994), local
government financing (1995), and the impact of the transition process on living standards
(1996). In June 1997, the Bank completed a Public Expenditure Review Update.
2.
In June 1999, the World Bank completed a Country Economic Memorandum entitled
“Estonia: Implementing the EU Accession Agenda.” In February 2000, the World Bank
initiated work on a Regional Development Program for the northeastern-most county of
Estonia, Ida Virumaa. The work included the development of an action program designed to:
(a) strengthen regional institutions providing labor and education services, as well as other
social services; (b) support the development of small and medium enterprises; and
(c) mitigate past environmental damages, contributing to sustainable development. The work
was completed in June 2000.
3.
The Board of Executive Directors approved the first World Bank lending operation in
Estonia, a Rehabilitation Loan for US$30 million, in October 1992. In May 1994, loans to
support district heating rehabilitation (US$38.4 million) and highway maintenance
(US$12 million) were approved. A US$10 million Financial Institutions Development Loan
(FIDL) was approved in October 1994, a health project (US$18 million) in January 1995,
followed in April 1995 by an environment loan (US$2 million), and an agricultural loan
(US$16 million) in March 1996. All the above-mentioned projects have already been
completed and closed. In March 2000, the Board approved a Transport Sector Project
(US$25 million), focusing primarily on road improvements. The project closing date is
December 31, 2005.
4.
The Bank’s local office in Tallinn was closed in June 2001. In late 2003 Estonia
opted to cancel the undisbursed World Bank loan balances, and the Bank’s last active project
(Transport Sector Project) was closed in December 2005. On September 17, 2006, Estonia
changed from World Bank borrower status to donor status.

32
APPENDIX III. ESTONIA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Data provision to the Fund is generally adequate for surveillance purposes, although
fiscal data on general government operations is not always timely. The Data ROSC mission
that visited Tallinn during May 10–18, 2001 found that the quality of the macroeconomic
statistics was generally good. It noted that international standards and guidelines were
generally followed. However, the quality of fiscal and monetary data was constrained by
incomplete coverage.
2.
Estonia is a subscriber to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS). The
Bank of Estonia (BoE) publishes a wide variety of data on the key variables for each of the
four sectors—monetary, fiscal, real and external—on its website, with periodic updates.
The following is a summary of both the frequency and the timeliness of key data as made
available to Fund staff:
A. Monetary Statistics
3.

All monetary data are issued by the BoE.1

•

BoE balance sheet (base money and NIR) are reported monthly, and are available on
the eighth day following the end of the month.2

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
November 17, 2006

This statement reports on data and official projections released subsequent to the finalization
of the Staff Report. These developments underscore but do not change the thrust of the staff
appraisal.
1.
On November 8, the Bank of Estonia (BOE) published a revised economic forecast
for 2006–08. The BOE’s growth forecast for 2006 has been revised up to 11.8 percent, well
above the staff’s projection of 10 percent. The revision reflects more recent data on
production and a more optimistic view of prospects for employment growth. For the
following two years, BOE’s growth projections are similar to staff’s. BOE’s new inflation
projection is somewhat lower than staff’s projection for 2006 because it incorporates the
recent decline in fuel prices, but slightly higher than staff’s projection in the outer years.
2.
A flash estimate of third quarter balance of payments, released on November 13,
shows a weakening of the current account relative to the previous two quarters and to staff
projections. The third quarter current account deficit is estimated at 16 percent of projected
third quarter GDP, bringing the current account ratio for the first three quarters to 14 percent.
The deterioration appears to reflect mainly a sharp drop in export growth, only partly offset
by a decline in import growth. While an explanation must await more detailed data, it is
likely that the deficit for the year will be wider than the 12.5 percent of GDP projected by the
staff and the central bank.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation with the
Republic of Estonia
On November 17, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with the Republic of Estonia.1
Background
Estonia’s commitment to free markets and prudent financial policies has paid off handsomely.
Far-reaching structural reforms have created a well-functioning market economy, closely
integrated with the Baltic and EU regions. A solid currency board arrangement (CBA) and
prudent fiscal policy have brought price stability and low public debt. These policies have
borne fruit with impressive productivity growth and a corresponding rise in real per capita
income—the strongest convergence among the EU’s new member states.
This very success is creating new challenges, including an overheating economy marked by
tightening labor markets, rising inflation and a wide current account deficit. GDP growth rose
above 10 percent in 2005 and is expected to continue at about the same rate in 2006.
Domestic consumption, spurred by rising confidence, was the main driver of demand, though
exports were also robust. Import growth has been even larger, however, further widening an
already large current account deficit. On the supply side, growth has been supported by
productivity increases which have, so far, kept up with real wages, and a surge in employment
which has brought unemployment to a record low.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of
the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to
the country's authorities.
1

2
The inflation rate—about 4½ percent annual average—is moderate for a fast-converging
economy but has been kept higher than the Maastricht threshold by convergence effects, fuel
prices, and, more recently, rising nontradables inflation—another symptom of overheating.
With the other Maastricht criteria satisfied by comfortable margins, inflation is the main
obstacle to euro adoption.
While the government budget has been in surplus for the last five years, the fiscal stance is
expansionary because strong revenue growth, partly reflecting cyclical influences, has been
matched by expenditure growth, including through supplementary budgets. The draft 2007
budget would loosen the fiscal stance further, with the general government surplus estimated
to fall from 1.2 percent of GDP to 0.9 percent.
Economic growth has been associated with rapid credit growth, largely financed by Nordic
banks through their Estonian affiliates. The banking system is financially sound, with high
profitability and almost nonexistent bad loans. Nonetheless, in view of accelerating credit,
highly concentrated in real estate, the authorities have recently taken prudential measures
aimed at increasing risk buffers and have signaled concern about the risks of very rapid credit
growth.
Executive Board Assessment
The Executive Directors commended Estonia’s impressive convergence towards EU living
standards, which is founded on a well-functioning and flexible market economy and on
macroeconomic stability, anchored in a currency board arrangement (CBA) and a commitment
to fiscal balance or surpluses. They noted that this success is giving rise to new challenges.
Growth has risen above potential and the external current account deficit is widening. Strong
demand is putting pressure on wages and prices, which could weaken competitiveness, while
fast credit growth could compromise banks’ assessment and pricing of risk. And, inflation,
while moderate, remains above the Maastricht reference value, delaying euro adoption.
Directors concurred that addressing these challenges will be key to sustaining the economy’s
enviable performance.
Directors commended the authorities for their commitment to fiscal rectitude. The surpluses
projected for 2006 and budgeted for 2007 are welcome. However, they appear too small,
implying an expansionary fiscal stance at a time when overheating pressures, higher-thandesired inflation, and a wide external current account deficit call for a tighter fiscal stance.
Under these circumstances, it would be advisable to save the revenue overperformance in
2006, and plan for at least a neutral budget in 2007 on a cyclically-adjusted basis. Directors
also emphasized that the exceptionally strong economic growth provides a welcome
opportunity to reduce the share of government expenditure in GDP and address the
challenges stemming from an aging population.
Directors observed that EU funds are complicating fiscal policy by providing an additional
stimulus. They congratulated the authorities on their effective procedures in allocating
structural EU funds, but cautioned that budget planning, including for the use of these funds,
needs to take into account their macroeconomic impact, particularly in overheated sectors.
In addition, Directors suggested that the authorities could lessen the pressure in overheated
sectors by easing restrictions on foreign labor participation. At the same time, they also

3
supported continued efforts to reduce skill mismatches, including through human capital
development.
Directors welcomed the progress in implementing a medium-term budgeting framework and
urged the authorities to eliminate the bias towards procyclical fiscal outcomes. This can be
achieved by moving the focus of fiscal policy targeting from the overall balance to expenditure
growth, allowing the balance to reflect the business cycle. Directors pointed out that significant
early steps in this direction would be to focus budget discussions on expenditures and to end
the practice of using supplementary budgets to spend cyclical revenue increases.
Directors concurred that early euro adoption should remain a key objective, as it would lock-in
the benefits of the currency board arrangement and eliminate the risks associated with a
separate currency. While these risks appear small in Estonia, they are increasing as external
debt and currency mismatches rise. Accordingly, Directors considered that a modest delay in
euro adoption would be easily manageable, but that a long or open-ended delay should be
avoided. They encouraged the authorities to adopt a clearly articulated strategy for euro
adoption.
Against this backdrop, Directors noted the challenge of meeting the Maastricht inflation
criterion, which is the one criterion for euro adoption that is currently not met by Estonia.
They concurred that efforts to contain inflation should be seen primarily as a means to firmly
entrench macroeconomic stability. Directors considered that a tight fiscal policy will have to be
at the core of the disinflation strategy.
Directors noted that Estonia’s close financial integration in the region has created a strong
institutional basis for financial deepening but puts a premium on cross-border cooperation and
supervisory vigilance. While increases in reserve requirements and in the risk weights on
mortgages earlier this year have sent an appropriate signal and led to more cushioning for risk,
there is little scope for further regulatory measures of this nature. Consequently, Directors
encouraged further strengthening of existing links between Estonian and Nordic supervisors to
ensure that foreign banks internalize the risks of their Estonian operations. Banks should also
be encouraged to improve risk management, including through more rigorous stress tests.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ plan to reduce mortgage interest deductibility and called
for further steps to eliminate all distortionary fiscal incentives for real estate investment.

Statement by Tuomas Saarenheimo, Executive Director for Republic of Estonia
and Timo Kosenko, Advisor to Executive Director
November 17, 2006
The Estonian authorities would like to express their appreciation to Mr. Rozwadowski and
his team for open and constructive discussions and a set of high quality papers. The
authorities agree with most of the assessments and recommendations put forward by staff. In
the following, we briefly describe the general macroeconomic situation in Estonia and will
focus on the key economic policy challenges thereafter.
General Macroeconomic Situation
Estonia has maintained high GDP growth since the last Article IV discussions and real
convergence is well underway, bringing Estonia’s real per capita income in PPP-terms to
some 70 percent of the EU average by 2007, compared to about 50 percent only four years
ago. Over a longer time horizon, high growth rates are sustained by strong productivity
improvements, relatively flexible and open economic structures and by strengthened
institutional capacity. The authorities share staff’s assessment that cyclical factors are also at
play and the economy is currently running above its potential. However, output expansion is
expected to level off in 2007 and 2008 to 7-8 percent, which the authorities consider as
Estonia’s medium-term potential.
Against this backdrop, the authorities remain fully committed to strong macroeconomic
policies. Estonia’s policy framework is centered at the currency board and fixed rate of
exchange, supported by tight fiscal policies and flexible markets. The general government
budget has been in surplus for five consecutive years and the cumulative surplus for 2002 to
2006 amounts to around 8.6 percent of GDP (13.6 billion EEK). The authorities have
prepared the 2007 budget with a view to avoid fiscal loosening and to ensure smooth
macroeconomic adjustment. At the same time, the authorities recognize that the key task of
fiscal policy, in particular in a small open economy, is to support a stable macroeconomic
environment over longer term, and not fine-tune any specific economic indicator. Thus, they
agree with staff on the importance of the medium-term budgetary framework.
The authorities note a few specific proposals in the staff report, namely to consider the
postponement of the planned cut in the income tax and prioritizing the use of the EU funds
with the aim to contain high growth in domestic demand. They emphasize that the income
tax reform is an important part of a medium-term structural change in the tax system to
reduce the share of direct taxes and is highly prioritized among the policy makers. With the
reform being fiscally neutral, the authorities consider it important to complete their key
policy commitment. However, they also note that the target of the tax reform was modified
somewhat in 2003 and 2005. The uniform income tax rate will be reduced to 20 percent by
2009, instead of the initially planned 2006. Regarding the use of the EU funds, the authorities

2
are fully committed to make sure that they are employed efficiently and in line with the wellestablished EU common policies, as also pointed out by staff. To this end, the authorities will
adhere to their National Strategic Reference Framework to provide detailed framework in
accordance with the Medium Term Budget Strategy. They also note that the allocation of the
funds arising from the EU financial perspective for 2007-2013 is in the planning phase, and
the authorities take fully into consideration the broader macroeconomic stance, including the
projected slowdown in economic growth.
Medium Term Challenges and Competitiveness
Our Estonian authorities agree that maintaining competitiveness and rapid productivity
growth remains a key precondition for sustained convergence in the medium- and long-term.
Estonia’s competitiveness is broadly adequate according to most commonly used indicators,
including the REER trends being consistent with convergence developments. However, they
note that ULC growth has accelerated recently and the nascent divergence in productivity
and real wage growth in the first half of 2006 calls for close monitoring. The authorities take
some comfort from Estonia’s decent standings in most international comparisons of the
business environment, and the Bank of Estonia’s recent research also tends to confirm the
flexibility in price and wage setting in Estonian companies.
However, further efforts are needed to maintain market flexibility and attractive business
climate. The labor market is one of the most important contributors to the economy’s longterm competitiveness. In the last couple of years Estonia’s unemployment level has rapidly
decreased, supported by market flexibility and the structural shift due to the opening up of
the EU labor markets. Still the migration of Estonian workers has remained below that from
most of the other new EU member states. In the future, further integration of European labor
markets may add to labor supply in Estonia as well. From its part, the Estonian labor market
is open to the intra-EU labor movement. In addition, the authorities have started discussion
on a new Labor Contract Act, which among other changes simplifies the laying-off
conditions for the companies. Also, the level of R&D expenditures has grown steadily, and
R&D is among the priorities in targeting the EU funds.
Sustained productivity growth and market flexibility are also essential to ensure
sustainability of Estonia’s external position. At this stage of the long economic cycle, it is
inevitable that part of high domestic investment is financed by foreign savings. As Estonia’s
domestic savings rate of 25 percent of GDP is increasing and economic growth is moving
closer to potential, the outlook for the medium-term adjustment remains broadly favorable.
Nevertheless, as the overall level of current account deficit is projected to narrow only
moderately in the near future, the authorities closely follow external developments. The
sustained level of FDI inflows (total FDI stock equals almost 100 percent of GDP) and the
fact that the large part of cross-border capital flows takes place within financial groups are
mitigating factors to avoid disruption in external financing.

3
Euro Adoption
Joining the euro area as soon as possible remains a key goal of the Estonian economic policy.
With currency board and fixed rate of exchange towards euro in place for almost 15 years
already, adoption of the euro is a natural economic policy objective. Estonia continues to
fulfill all Maastricht criteria except the inflation criterion. The hike in international oil prices
did not allow for reaching the Maastricht inflation criterion in late 2005 and early 2006, since
the Estonian consumer basket is almost twice as highly exposed to changes in the world
energy prices compared to that in the European Union. More recently, inflation has also been
affected by factors related to convergence and cyclical position.
Estonian price developments continue to be very well in line with the equilibrating catching
up process, and inflationary expectations are firmly anchored by the currency board
framework. However, the recent inflation forecasts render the likelihood of euro adoption in
2008 and 2009 negligible. The authorities note staff’s estimates that opportunities exist to
reach the Maastricht inflation criterion in the second half of 2008. That would allow joining
the euro area in 2010 at the earliest. Current stability and growth oriented policy framework
remains the cornerstone in joining the common currency area. The authorities stay vigilant in
monitoring closely the risks and market reaction associated with the delay in the euro
adoption. Still, recent data indicate that given the continued strong policies, the
postponement of the euro adoption has had no material impact on market expectations until
now.
Financial Sector and Real Estate Market
The Estonian banking and financial system is fully integrated with the Nordic and
international financial conglomerates. Nearly all financial institutions in Estonia operate
under risk and liquidity management systems that are uniform across large regional financial
groups. The structure of the financial system has had a strong impact on financial
intermediation, allowing the mobilization of foreign savings and very substantial
intertemporal consumption and investment smoothing. It also provides for virtually unlimited
supply of credit, at least in the short-term. At the same time, sustained increase in disposable
income has brought along higher demand for credit, in particular for mortgage borrowing.
These developments have been accompanied by structural changes in economy and banking,
bringing along lower interest rates and longer maturities.
Fundamental changes in the credit market have had their impact on real estate, especially on
the housing market activity. In particular, households have made use of consumption
smoothing opportunities to improve their living conditions. As a result, apartment prices in
Tallinn increased almost 40 percent in 2005. However, in recent months, there are clear signs
of cooling: apartment prices in Tallinn have increased on average by only about 10 percent
compared to the end of 2005 and the selling periods have lengthened. It is important to

4
underline that the biggest share of real estate activity is related to the housing market with
only a limited amount of speculative transactions involved. There is also little evidence of
home equity withdrawal for consumption. The authorities have started discussions to further
limit the ceiling of mortgage interest deduction from personal income tax.
While being inherently beneficial for the economy, developments in the financial system
pose new challenges for the authorities. Their main goal is to support full financial market
integration in the EU, but rapid credit growth calls for a prudent approach domestically. The
Bank of Estonia has somewhat tightened capital adequacy calculation and reserve
requirement. However, the authorities consider strong cross-border cooperation as the key for
effective risk assessment and crisis prevention to avoid sudden changes in credit supply.
Recent stress tests on household loan portfolio indicate that the rise in unemployment to the
highest level seen during the last decade in Estonia or a considerable increase in Euribor
would affect only a tiny part of borrowers. Strong fiscal stance and gradual slowdown in
income growth should contribute to lower credit demand in the private sector. An
increasingly apparent slowdown of activity in the real estate market and the exhausted
possibilities in improving credit conditions should with some lag start to be reflected in the
credit growth as well.
The Economy’s Balance Sheet
The robustness of the currency board arrangement and perceived low exchange rate risk has
brought along currency mismatches in non-bank private sector balance sheets. It should be
noted that the mismatches concern only liabilities in euros, which are allocated under very
similar conditions to domestic currency loans. The maturity mismatches observed in the
financial sector reflect the full integration of the Estonian financial sector to the Nordic
markets that, as explained above, also involves centralized liquidity management. The
authorities consider balance sheet mismatches to be mitigated by several factors, including
the objective of the euro area accession. A big part of the net liability position is related to
foreign direct investment stock (97 percent of GDP in 2005) reflecting an attractive
investment climate. From the external debt point of view, gross levels (86 percent of GDP in
2005) are considerably mitigated by Estonian financial sector’s intra-group flows mediator
role that has kept net external debt low (18 percent of GDP in 2005). Notwithstanding, the
authorities remain most vigilant in monitoring risks arising from balance sheet mismatches,
especially as the euro area accession has been postponed, and remain dedicated to keeping a
strong economic policy framework.
