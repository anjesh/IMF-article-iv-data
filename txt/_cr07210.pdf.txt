Staff Report for the 2007 Article IV Consultation1

(In consultation with Other Departments)

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Ghana’s economy has been performing well in a supportive world economy, but the
fiscal deficit deteriorated substantially in 2006. The economic outlook is generally
positive, but short-term risks arise from the fiscal problems and energy shortages.
Ghana has a historic opportunity to accelerate growth to reach the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs) and achieve middle-income status within a decade. But
attaining a high-growth trajectory while preserving macroeconomic stability will be a
challenge, because there are public expectations of a rapid rise in income given Ghana’s
recent economic success, and because the country is gearing up for presidential elections next
year. Another challenge will be to finance Ghana’s development agenda and attain the MDGs
when aid is not likely to be scaled up soon.
Main outcome of the discussions:
•

The authorities’ strategy for accelerating growth is fitting; it starts with large
infrastructure projects to raise growth potential. It will be equally important to
enhance total factor productivity by increasing the efficiency of public sector
spending and sustaining macro-critical structural reforms.

•

As the fiscal deterioration in 2006 demonstrated, preserving macroeconomic
stability is vital. The authorities are appropriately addressing the fiscal slippage with

Discussions took place in Accra, January 31–February 14, 2007, and March 26–28, 2007. The staff team
comprised Ms. Nagy (head), Ms. Pattillo, Ms. Loukoianova, Mr. Motshidisi (all AFR), Ms. Brixiova (PDR),
Mr. Akitoby (FAD), and Mr. McIntyre, Resident Representative in Accra. The mission worked closely with
World Bank staff. Staff met with the President, the Minister of Finance, the Governor of the Bank of Ghana,
other senior officials, and representatives of development partners, business, and trade unions. Mr. Mirakhor,
Executive Director for Ghana, participated in the policy discussions during the February mission.

2
a combination of measures to enhance revenue, cut nonessential capital expenditure,
and accelerate structural reforms.
•

Monetary policy successfully reduced inflation to below 10 percent by
March 2007. Staff considers that interest rates may need to be increased if fiscal
problems are not corrected; the Bank of Ghana did not see a potential case for an
interest rate increase.

•

The Bank of Ghana (BoG) has adopted many elements of inflation targeting (IT)
over the years and has begun to operate a monetary regime that is akin to IT
“lite.” Beyond the primary IT objective, there seems to be a secondary operational
exchange rate objective to support the inflation goal. Staff underscored that effective
IT will require a more flexible exchange rate policy.

•

Views differed on how exchange rate policy is being implemented. Staff believes
that the stability of the cedi against the U.S. dollar in recent years was the result not
only of good macroeconomic policies but also of the BoG’s statutory involvement in
the foreign exchange market, which allows it to manage the exchange rate heavily.
The BoG considered that good policies and confidence alone were keeping the
exchange rate stable.

•

In the absence of imminent scaling up of donor assistance, prudent and gradual
nonconcessional borrowing for carefully selected high-return projects can help
finance poverty reduction. To this end, institutional capacity for selecting projects
and managing debt needs to be enhanced further.

•

A joint debt sustainability analysis incorporating future nonconcessional
borrowing rated the risks to Ghana’s external debt sustainability as moderate,
albeit close to the low risk category.

I. RECENT ECONOMIC AND POLICY DEVELOPMENTS
1.
The Ghanaian economy has
performed well in recent years; in 2006 real
GDP growth reached 6.2 percent, the
highest rate since the early 1990s. An
exceptionally good cocoa harvest, two new
gold mines coming on stream, and activities in
construction and services (responding to the
improved business environment) were the
main factors. Large remittance inflows fuelled
both consumption and private investment in
housing. The economy has thus far proved
reasonably resilient to the energy shortages
that began in September 2006 (Box 1).

Monetary aggregates grew twice as fast as the central bank’s objectives for 2006
in the wake of a stronger-than-foreseen increase in net foreign assets in the last months
of the year, but inflation continued to decline, probably reflecting a concurrent increase
in the demand for money. Indeed, a notable consequence of ongoing structural changes has
been an increasingly unstable demand for money. The Bank of Ghana (BoG)’s Monetary
Policy Committee (MPC) lowered its prime rate by two percentage points in December 2006
and kept the rate unchanged in March 2007.

Box 1. Responding to the Energy Crisis
In September 2006, shortfalls in power supply and surging demand caused serious energy
shortages in Ghana. In the fourth quarter low water levels at the Akosombo Dam, the larger of the two
hydroelectric generators in Ghana, reduced the power supply by an estimated 25 to 30 percent. The
problem is expected to persist through the first half of 2007. Meanwhile electricity demand has increased
substantially in the last decade in the wake of strong economic growth. In 2006, exceptional demand
from VALCO, the aluminum smelter, put additional strains on the energy supply. To meet the growing
demand, the VRA, the main energy producer, has been moving from mainly hydro generation to a
hydrothermal mix. This makes the energy supply less dependent on the weather but increases the cost of
energy significantly.
The government responded quickly to the crisis, instituting a national load-management exercise.
Waste has also been cut and efficiency increased. Most (private) mining operators and some
manufacturing and service establishments have bought their own generators; electricity use is low in
other sectors. As a result, the economy has proven to be quite resilient to energy shortages.
The government has moved to augment supply and to reinstate full cost recovery pricing. It started
major investments and reduced exports to neighboring countries. New thermal generation investments
that will allow for tapping gas from the West African Gas Pipeline (WAGP) are scheduled for
completion in late 2007. The recently announced closing of VALCO will also free up significant
amounts of energy for the rest of the economy and reduce budget support to VRA. New projects
(including hydro generation) are planned. As part of the authorities’ fiscal package, the utility tariff
regulation system is being reinstated with a commitment to move toward full cost recovery.

increases in the rest of the public sector in the
second half of the year. The public sector wage bill and related allocations now exceed
10 percent of GDP, absorbing close to half of domestic revenue. Higher subsidies and
transfers to the energy sector reflected the suspension of pass-through of utility price
increases to end users after May 2006. The higher deficit was financed by nonbank
borrowing, in part by issuing local currency (cedi) bonds, many of which were purchased by

7
foreign investors. As a result, the trend decline in the ratio of domestic debt to GDP, the
authorities’ fiscal anchor, was reversed.
5.
Ghana continued to accumulate
international reserves, despite a widening
of the external current account deficit
(including grants) to 8.2 percent of GDP in
2006 from 7.0 percent of GDP in 2005. A
significant improvement in the trade deficit as
a share of GDP, helped by terms of trade
gains and strong export growth, was more
than offset by a decline in project grants. But
strong capital inflows helped raise gross
international reserves to slightly over
3 months of imports. Thanks to massive HIPC
and MDRI debt relief 3 and good
macroeconomic policies, Ghana’s external
debt dropped from about 120 percent of GDP
in 2000 to just 22 percent in 2006.

Banks seem to be generally well capitalized, profitable, and fairly liquid. As of
January 2007 the average bank capital adequacy ratio was 17 percent, well above the
10 percent minimum; and all banks met the minimum capital requirements that came into
effect at the end of 2006. Nonperforming loans declined to 7.5 percent of total loans at the
end of January 2007, due to both rapid growth in loan assets and better loan recovery. Loan
provisioning appears to be adequate. There are no clear signs of major asset price (stock
market or housing) inflation. The BoG’s self-assessment showed full compliance with the
recommendations of the 2003 FSAP update. Competition is increasing, with five foreign
banks from the region entering the market in 2006. Financial deepening is rapid, though from
a very shallow base.
7.
Critical structural reforms moved forward in public financial management
(PFM), though some others have been delayed. There have been improvements in fiscal
reporting, treasury reform, and deployment of the new computerized payroll management
system. The monthly reviews of petroleum product pricing introduced in April 2006 are
proceeding smoothly. Still, tariff increases for electricity and water, which should have been
put into effect in May 2006, were gazetted in November but not passed on to consumers.
Special energy tariffs for mines and VALCO, the aluminum smelter, contributed to belowcost-recovery prices for the Volta River Authority (VRA), the main state-owned energy
producer. As a result, both the VRA and ECG, the main energy distributor, came under
significant financial pressure. Public and civil service sector reforms have been slow, but are
now being stepped-up.

the energy sector.

II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
8.
Ghana is entering a new phase in its economic development; it has a historic
opportunity to accelerate growth so that within a decade it can reach the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs) and middle-income status. The macroeconomic stabilization
and structural reforms of recent years are paying off; business confidence is growing, and
private sector activity is picking up. Good economic policies have earned Ghana massive
external debt relief and financial support from development partners and have increased the
interest of investors both at home and abroad.
9.

This new phase raises two main questions:

•

How can Ghana attain a high-growth trajectory without risking macroeconomic
stability? This is particularly important because of public expectations of rapidly
rising income in the wake of Ghana’s recent economic success, and the fact that the
country is gearing up for presidential elections next year. The fiscal slippage in 2006
demonstrates the challenge.

•

How can Ghana finance its development agenda and attain the MDGs in light of
unlikely scaling-up of aid in the near future? A corollary question is: how can debt be
kept sustainable?

10.

Against this background, the discussions with the authorities focused on:

•
•
•

How to accelerate growth while preserving macrostability;
The economic outlook, macroeconomic policies, and vulnerabilities;
Prospects for reaching the MDGs, scaling up donor support, and accessing capital
markets while keeping debt sustainable.
A. Accelerating Growth and Preserving Economic Stability

11.
Staff supported the authorities’ plan to accelerate growth to meet the MDGs and
Ghana’s own Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS) II goals. The growth
strategy is centered on scaling up public sector investment, financed by external grants and
concessional resources, and, for the first time in decades, tapping international capital
markets if concessional financing is not available. Large infrastructural projects are needed to
remove supply bottlenecks in the energy sector and infrastructure. The authorities’ approach
also incorporates measures to improve conditions for private sector development, invest in
human resources, and strengthen economic governance.
12.
It was agreed that special attention should be given to preserving
macroeconomic stability. Staff noted that there was a risk that bunching large investment
projects may create supply bottlenecks and wage pressures that could jeopardize
macrostability. This was important because inflation was still about 10 percent and because
pressures for additional fiscal spending may re-emerge on the way to next year’s presidential
elections.
13.
Staff and the authorities also concurred that, in addition to infrastructure
projects, the growth strategy should put strong emphasis on removing obstacles to
growth and increasing total factor productivity. The latter can be achieved by further

9
increasing the efficiency of public sector spending, starting civil service reform, and by
sustaining macro-critical structural reforms, such as PFM and financial sector reform.4
B. Economic Outlook, Macroeconomic Policies, and Vulnerabilities
14.
Ghana’s near-term prospects are positive. Indicators suggest that growth will hold
up, supported by buoyant services and construction activities. Staff projects output growth of
6.3 percent in 2007 and 6.9 percent in 2008, with the current account deficit widening
slightly in 2007. Inflation would decline to the upper band of the authorities’ target range of
7-9 percent in 2007. The authorities projected moderately higher economic growth over the
medium term than staff did.
15.
The main short-term risks to the positive outlook come from the recent
deterioration of the fiscal accounts and the difficulties in the energy sector; the
authorities are addressing both. Their fiscal package, detailed below, appropriately aims to
reverse the fiscal worsening. The energy shortage will ease because VALCO, a high energy
user, was closed in March for the rest of the year; emergency supplies are being put in place;
and movement toward full cost recovery pricing in energy and utilities has been announced
from May 1. In both the fiscal and energy areas, time is of the essence. The outlook is also
subject to a deterioration of the external environment, particularly a worsening of Ghana’s
terms of trade.
16.

debt around 40 percent of GDP. The external
current account deficit, including grants, would stabilize around 7 and 8 percent of GDP and
international reserves increase marginally to above 3 months of imports. Under this scenario,
a joint DSA analysis with the World Bank indicates that risks to Ghana’s debt sustainability
are moderate; albeit close to the low risk category; risks to overall public debt sustainability
are also moderate (Appendix).

10
Fiscal policy
17.
The fiscal deficit is expected to decline from 7.7 percent of GDP in 2006 to
6.8 percent in 2007. The fiscal slippage in the second half of 2006 necessitated a number of
corrective measures, which, together with one-time support to VRA and several urgent
investments to ease energy shortages, are being incorporated into the budget. A
supplementary budget is being prepared for submission to parliament by mid-summer 2007.
18.
The authorities’ fiscal package aims at a correction equivalent to 1.7 percent of
GDP in 2007 relative to the baseline scenario of unchanged policies. Staff supported the
package and agreed with the authorities that timely implementation is critical. The package is
designed to:
•

Reduce exemptions from import duties5 and accelerate collection of tax arrears.

•

Implement the postponed energy and utility tariff increases to industrial users as of
May 1 and to residential users by August 1.6

•

Conduct a full review of the utility
tariff structure and preferential rates
for bulk users for the eventual move to
full cost-recovery pricing for utilities
by year-end.

•
•

•

Cut nonessential domestic capital
expenditure.
Streamline the wage-setting process by
committing to increase real wages
only in line with productivity and
index wages to the central bank’s
inflation target. At the same time, start
the civil service reform by announcing
rightsizing.

19.
Recognizing the authorities’ focus on overall debt sustainability, staff proposed a
shift from the present fiscal anchor, domestic public debt/GDP, to a broader debt
category, such as total public debt/GDP.7 Moreover, with the recent purchase of local
currency treasury bonds by foreign investors, the line between “domestic” and “external”

debt is becoming blurred. The authorities agreed that total debt could be a more suitable
fiscal anchor in the future.
20.
Looking ahead, the authorities are considering introducing a fiscal responsibility
law, building on the existing Financial Administration Act of 2003. A fiscal responsibility
law could cement fiscal discipline and anchor fiscal expectations by lengthening the planning
horizon over the political cycle. It could enshrine both good fiscal institutions (such as the
value for money unit that is being set up) and set quantitative fiscal rule(s).
Monetary and interest rate policy
21.
The monetary regime has evolved over the past years from targeting monetary
aggregates to what the authorities call a “de facto” inflation targeting (IT) framework.
Since 2002, the BoG has been building up an inflation targeting framework, with support
from the Bank of England. Regarding the institutional conditions for an IT, many are in place
(central bank instrument independence; development of liquidity instruments; procedures for
IT regime such as operating an MPC, inflation modeling and forecasting), while others are
partly in place (full-fledged communication strategy). Regarding the policy conditions, the
authorities have moved to preclude fiscal dominance by legally restricting central bank’s
financing of the deficit (in practice there has not been any in recent years), and to accelerate
financial sector development. The latter would enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy
instruments, strengthening the relationship between interest rates and inflation.
22.
Staff considers that the present monetary regime operates as an IT “lite” regime.
In addition to the primary objective of targeting inflation, a secondary operational exchange
rate objective seems to be pursued. The exchange rate of the cedi to the U.S. dollar has been
kept relatively stable since 2004, helping to anchor inflation expectations. Staff noted that for
the IT to be fully effective, the exchange rate needed to be flexible.
23.
The BoG considered that lowering the prime rate in December was warranted
because interest rates had been unchanged for about a year despite declining inflation;
most core inflation indicators also pointed to a trend decline. Noting that the inflation
objective was achieved after its upward revision and that the fiscal outturn had been
considerably worse than expected in 2006, staff suggested that interest rates may need to be
increased should implementation of the fiscal measures suffer a delay. The BoG did not see a
potential case for a rate increase but stated that further interest rate reduction was possible
only once the fiscal situation improves.
Exchange rate policy and capital account liberalization
24.
Staff believes that beyond good macroeconomic policies that build confidence,
the stability of the cedi with respect to the U.S. dollar in recent years is a result of the
Bank of Ghana’s statutory involvement in the foreign exchange market, which allows it
to manage the exchange rate heavily. There is a high compulsory surrender requirement to
the BoG for the main export items, cocoa and gold (the buy end of the foreign exchange
market), and the BoG supplies foreign exchange to the main oil importer company (TOR)
through the partially government-owned Ghana Commercial Bank (the sale end).

12
Consequently, the interbank foreign exchange market is shallow and banks often rely on the
BoG for foreign exchange. The authorities maintained that confidence-inducing
macroeconomic policies alone were responsible for the relative stability of the cedi against
the U.S. dollar.
25.
It was agreed that the exchange rate
was broadly in line with macroeconomic
fundamentals. Staff calculations indicate that
after a significant overshooting following the
large depreciation of the cedi in 2000, Ghana’s
real effective exchange rate (REER) seems to
have reverted to its long-term equilibrium level
consistent with its macroeconomic fundamentals
by 2006. Other competitiveness indicators, such
as the profitability of the tradable sector, export
performance, and relatively unchanged shares in
world exports (as well as in Ghana’s main export
markets) also indicate that the 10 to 15 percent
real effective appreciation of the cedi over the
last six years is not cause for concern.8

26.
In 2006 the authorities started to liberalize capital controls, focusing on the
longer end of the market (maturities of 3 years or more) and requiring a minimum
holding period of 1 year. This allowed foreign investors to buy the cedi-denominated
5-year-maturity treasury bonds issued in December 2006. Staff supported the authorities’
plan to ease controls gradually as this will make for a more diversified and deeper foreign
exchange market while allowing time for domestic capital market development. Remaining
portfolio controls on non-residents include prohibition of investment in money market
instruments with a maturity shorter than three years, prohibition of sale or local issuance of
these instruments, and some other restrictions on capital market transactions; for residents,
restrictions on the use of foreign exchange accounts for capital transactions. Provided that
good macro economic policies continue, risks of sudden capital reversals are presently
limited, because most of the inflows are concessional resources or long term foreign direct
investment. However, increasing nonconcessional borrowing in the future would increase
such risks, underlining the importance of prudent borrowing and enhanced debt management
and monitoring.
27.
Staff suggested that foreign exchange markets be further liberalized. A gradual
easing of the high surrender requirements for the main export items and elimination of direct
sales of foreign exchange to TOR once the latter is privatized would make room for market
expansion. The authorities indicated that the high surrender requirements on cocoa export

proceeds had the purpose of ensuring foreign exchange repatriation by the state-owned
Ghana Cocoa Board and the prevention of exchange rate volatility that would result from the
lumpiness of those proceeds if sold directly to the foreign exchange market; some relaxation
might be possible over time.

Nevertheless, the speed at which the financial

vigilance, particularly with regard to potential
maturity mismatch as well as concentration and credit risk. The authorities’ planned eventual
move to a more risk sensitive regulatory system such as the simplified (i.e., the standardized)
approach of Basel II would also help. The next stage of financial sector reforms focuses
appropriately on developing domestic capital markets, which, in tandem with a continued
gradual liberalization of the capital account and legislative reform, would help competition,
efficiency, and better information and thus risk assessment. These actions should help narrow
the still high interest rate spreads and sustain ongoing financial deepening.
e

Macro-critical reforms
29.
The authorities noted that the efficiency of public spending is being enhanced by
continued PFM and civil service reforms, and divestiture. Staff welcomed these reforms,
which, as well as those to improve the business environment and foster private sector
productivity, should be strongly growth-enhancing. In PFM, the computerized budget and
public expenditure management system will be installed in Accra and the three regional
capitals by year-end; the new computerized payroll management system is being deployed,
with subvented agencies being integrated into the system by year-end, the commitment
control and cash management systems are being enhanced, and a single treasury account is
being developed. Public Expenditure Tracking Surveys in the education and health sectors
9

See the accompanying Selected Issues Paper.

14
have been launched in March. Finally, a new value for money unit is being set up to support
the project-vetting process that is currently handled by the Capital Market Committee.
30.
Civil service reform is beginning with rightsizing. The main objectives are to
determine the appropriate number of workers needed to deliver public services efficiently
and retrench accordingly; link public sector pay to productivity, position, and qualification;
and keep public sector wages competitive with the private sector. The authorities are
planning to start a retrenchment program with donor support, starting with subvented
agencies. The reduced employment should make room for paying higher wage to skilled
employees.
31.
The divestiture program is being accelerated, focusing on the telecommunication
sector and oil refineries, including TOR. This is consistent with the government’s policy to
give the private sector a crucial role in its growth acceleration strategy, and would also ease
the fiscal burden in the future. The government also intends to ensure private sector
participation in the planned major infrastructural projects through public-private partnerships
(PPPs). The current PPP guidelines can be usefully strengthened by ensuring that the related
fiscal risks and contingent liabilities are disclosed and accounted for in the budget.
C. Reaching the MDGs, Scaling Up, and Capital Market Access
32.
Preliminary results from the Maquette for MDG Simulation (MAMS) exercise
indicate that Ghana may deliver on some MDGs but will fail on others unless there is a
major scaling up of aid.
•

The MDG on halving poverty is likely to be achieved well before 2015 thanks to
strong growth and appropriate supportive policies. That on education is also likely to
be within reach by 2015.

•

The MDGs on health and on water and sanitation are not likely to be met unless
resources are scaled up by several percentage points of GDP annually, provided that
absorptive capacity will be adequate to effectively utilize additional resources.
Synergies across different MDGs are important in the MAMS: progress on health and
education would likely be higher with more improvements in water and sanitation
infrastructure.

15
33.
Discussions with the authorities
and representatives of development
partners suggest that donor support is not
likely to be scaled up soon.10 Total donor
support—budget grants and project and
program loans—peaked at about 9 percent of
GDP in 2004 but fell to below 7 percent in
2006. While this outcome reflected delays on
specific projects, commitments through 2009
indicate that concessional flows should be
about 7 percent of GDP per year for the
period. Over the next years the historical
average level of official financing of 89 percent of GDP would be reached through
nonconcessional borrowing.

Reaching the MDGs and the goals identified in the Growth and Poverty
Reduction Strategy (GPRS II) in the absence of imminent scaling up of donor assistance
would require that Ghana access international capital markets. It was agreed that access
should be gradual, for high-yielding projects only, and preceded by institutionalizing an
effective method for selecting projects and monitoring and structuring debt. The authorities
have now trimmed their earlier investment plans to limit nonconcessional borrowing to about
US$700 million over the next three years (equivalent to 1.4 percent of GDP annually);
specific annual amounts will depend on market conditions and the projects chosen. The
project selection process gained credibility with the work of the Capital Market Committee,
which consists of high-level BoG and Ministry of Finance officials; the authorities are now
setting up a value for money unit with donor assistance to support the work of the committee.
The project selection process consists of screening large public investment projects by using
basic cost-benefit and cost effectiveness analysis. The IMF is providing capacity-building
support to upgrade the debt management unit.

10

This excludes emerging market donors; information is limited, and there are indications that some of such
official financing would be nonconcessional.

16
35.
Keeping debt sustainable is a policy
goal of the authorities that staff fully
endorsed. A DSA prepared by IMF and
World Bank staff, which takes into account
planned nonconcessional borrowing indicates
that the risks to the sustainability of Ghana’s
external debt are moderate, albeit close to low
(Appendix). However, because lower growth
than in the baseline scenario could raise the
risks in later years, macroeconomic stability,
structural reforms, and export diversification
are critically important. Risks are partially
mitigated by Ghana’s high remittance inflows,
which are not incorporated into the standard
debt sustainability indicators.

36.
The authorities generally agreed with the findings and conclusions of the Ex Post
Assessment of Long-term Program Engagement, which reviewed experience with the
three most recent Fund arrangements, which together covered the past decade.11 In particular,
they agreed with the emphasis in the report on the importance of increased transparency and
the development of a participatory democracy with appropriate checks and balances. They
considered that on balance the support of the Fund and other donors had helped Ghana
achieve macroeconomic stability, but that staff could have been more sensitive to the
political economy of reform. The authorities agreed with the report's conclusion that
institutional reform and improved expenditure management would reduce the likelihood of a
repeat of previous election-induced slippages, but did not fully share the report’s view that a
clearer monetary policy framework could have helped achieve more rapid disinflation, as
their attempt to reduce inflation was mainly obstructed by a series of adverse price shocks.
37.
In the context of the Article IV consultations, staff and the authorities discussed
Ghana’s future relations with the Fund in light of the expiration of the latest PRGF
arrangement in October 2006. As indicated in the 2007 budget document, the government
saw merit in discussing Fund support under a Policy Support Instrument (PSI). The
discussions during the consultation were preliminary, and covered possible building blocks
of a program that could be supported under a PSI.

Box 2. Summary of Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA)
Ghana’s risk of external debt distress is moderate, albeit close to the low risk category.
The baseline scenario assumes (i) macroeconomic stability (prudent fiscal stance, single
digit inflation); (ii) continued structural reforms; and (iii) prudent borrowing and efficient
use of borrowed funds. All external debt indicators are below their policy-dependent
thresholds. However, under stress tests, some of the indicators worsen over the projection
period, assuming various macroeconomic shocks and the slowdown of reforms.
Alternative Scenario A that assumes baseline borrowing and lower growth of GDP and
exports indicates also moderate, but notably higher, risk of debt distress than the baseline
scenario.
Alternative Scenario B that assumes roughly double nonconcessional borrowing and
baseline growth indicates still moderate but also notably higher debt distress that the
baseline scenario.
Alternative Scenario C that combines higher nonconcessional borrowing from Scenario B
and lower growth from Scenario A indicates that Ghana would be approaching high risk of
debt distress by the end of the projection period, as both the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio
and the debt service-to-exports would approach the policy-dependent thresholds at the end
of the projection period, and all stress tests and historical scenarios would exceed the
thresholds.

The public debt sustainability analysis that includes both external and domestic debt
also indicates a risk of moderate debt distress. The baseline scenario projects an increase
in total public debt from about 40 percent of GDP in 2007 to over 50 percent in 2026, due
to some deceleration of growth and continued borrowing in outer years. The sensitivity
analyses suggest that the baseline scenario is most vulnerable to a shock to real GDP growth
(see Appendix).

III. STAFF APPRAISAL
38.
Ghana has a unique opportunity to achieve its development objectives. Prudent
macroeconomic policies and structural reforms, a supportive international environment,
massive debt relief, and donor financial support have contributed to macroeconomic
stabilization, growth, and a vibrant private sector that has proved resilient to recent energy
supply bottlenecks. But success has created expectations in the public of rapidly rising future
income that, if not managed, might derail this process, particularly as the country gears up for
elections next year. The fiscal slippage in 2006 demonstrates the issue. The new era brings
new challenges that the authorities need to address so they can capitalize on the opportunity.
39.
The main short-term risks to the positive outlook relate to the recent fiscal
deterioration and the energy problem. The authorities are addressing both areas, but
decisive and timely implementation of all fiscal measures will be critical, particularly in the
looming election period. Accelerated divestiture will strengthen the private sector’s role in
the economy and ease any future burden on the budget. In the energy sector, immediate
progress will hinge both on selecting projects that can quickly ease supply bottlenecks and
the government’s sustained commitment to full cost-recovery pricing for all users. The
outlook is also subject to the risk of a possible deterioration of the external environment,
particularly a worsening of Ghana’s terms of trade.
40.
The Bank of Ghana has been building capacity for moving toward formal
inflation targeting, and staff considers that the present monetary regime is akin to
inflation targeting “lite,” where there seems to be a secondary policy objective for the
exchange rate in support of the inflation target. The authorities’ efforts to strengthen
domestic financial markets are, inter alia, enhancing the monetary transmission mechanism;
moving toward exchange rate flexibility would also help the effectiveness of the IT regime.
41.
The authorities’ plan to continue gradual and cautious relaxation of capital
controls is appropriate. It will help Ghana benefit from financial globalization and manage
potentially large capital inflows. The current financial sector development program is
supporting this process, appropriately focusing on strengthening domestic capital markets.
42.
The banking system appears to be healthy, but it will be important to continue
enhancing regulation and move over time toward risk-based supervision and the more
risk-sensitive Basel II regulatory system. The rapid growth in private sector credit in recent
years supports much needed financial deepening but will need to be closely monitored.
43.
Civil service reform is long overdue and its planned start with rightsizing is
welcome. Sustained progress in other areas is also important, such as PFM and public
investment project selection and debt management and monitoring.
44.
Reaching the authorities’ growth and poverty reduction goals and the MDGs
demands both sustained government efforts and additional financial resources to fund
them. In the absence of scaling up of donor financial support in the near future, the

19
authorities have decided to access international capital markets to finance prudently selected
high-yielding infrastructural projects. Ghana can benefit from financial globalization in this
way but, because it is still a low-income country, access needs to be gradual and conditioned
on there being effective institutions in place to select projects and monitor debt. Prudently
leveraging financial globalization will be key to bring Ghana to a high growth trajectory that
will reduce poverty.
45.
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation will be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

Note: In some cases the data are for earlier or later years than those stated.
1

As reported in the Ghana Poverty Reduction Strategy 2006 and the Annual Progress Report (2005).
Targets: Halve, between 1990 and 2015, the proportion of people whose income is less than US$1 a day; halve, between 1990 and 2015, the proportion of
people who suffer from hunger.
2

3

Data for 1994.
Target: Ensure that, by 2015, children everywhere, boys and girls alike, will be able to complete a full course of primary schooling.
5
Target: Eliminate gender disparity in primary and secondary education, preferably by 2005, and to all levels of education, no later than 2015.
6
Target: Reduce by two-thirds, between 1990 and 2015, the under-5 mortality rate.
7
Target: Reduce by three-quarters, between 1990 and 2015, the maternal mortality ratio.
8
Targets: Have halted by 2015, and begun to reverse, the spread of HIV/AIDS. Have halted by 2015, and begun to reverse, the incidence of malaria and other
major deseases.
4

9

Targets: Integrate the principles of sustainable development into country policies and programs and reverse the loss of environmental resources. Halve, by
the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water. By 2020, achieve a significant improvement in the lives of at least 100 million
slum dwellers.

10

Targets: Develop further an open, rule-based, predictable, nondiscriminatory trading and financial system. Address the special needs of the least developed
countries. Address the special needs of landlocked countries and small island developing states. Deal comprehensively with the debt problems of developing
countries through national and international measures in order to make debt sustainable in the long term. In cooperation with developing countries, develop
and implement strategies for decent and productive work for youth. In cooperation with pharmaceutical companies, provide access to affordable, essential
drugs in developing countries. In cooperation with the private sector, make available the benefits of new technologies, especially information
and communication
National specification of individual indicators and targets may differ from the ones reported in the WDI database.

APPENDIX I
GHANA—JOINT IMF AND WORLD BANK DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS1
Ghana’s external debt distress risk rating is moderate, albeit close to the low risk category.
The baseline scenario is contingent on continued macroeconomic stability and structural
reforms that would lead to expansion of the private sector with resulting growth in GDP and
exports. The analysis illustrates the importance of prudent debt management and judicious
use of borrowed funds. The risk of debt distress related to total public debt—both external
and domestic—is also moderate.
A. EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Summary
The baseline scenario assumes (i) continued macroeconomic stabilization (prudent fiscal
stance, single-digit inflation), (ii) perseverance with the pace of structural reforms (public
financial management (PFM), reforms of state-owned enterprises (SOEs), including
divestiture), and (iii) prudent borrowing strategy and efficient use of borrowed funds. It
incorporates nonconcessional borrowing of US$700 million over the next three years and
continued annual market access of about 1 percent of GDP for the rest of the projection
period. In making these assumptions, the analysis attempts to be realistic with regard to
commercial borrowing volumes and illustrates the value of prudence and the importance of
the judicious use of nonconcessional funds.
In addition to the baseline scenario, three alternative scenarios are investigated:

1



Alternative scenario A has the same borrowing path as in the baseline but lower
growth of exports and GDP. This scenario examines whether the risk of debt distress
would significantly increase should GDP growth and exports fail to accelerate.



Alternative scenario B has higher nonconcessional borrowing than in the baseline
but the same macroeconomic framework. The purpose is to examine the impact of
higher borrowing on the risk of debt distress.



Alternative scenario C has the higher nonconcessional borrowing path of Scenario B
and the lower GDP and export growth of Scenario A. This scenario highlights the
risks of high borrowing if growth of GDP and exports does not accelerate.

Prepared by the IMF and World Bank staff in collaboration with the Ghanaian authorities.

31
1. BASELINE SCENARIO
Macroeconomic Assumptions
The baseline scenario is contingent upon continued macroeconomic stability and structural
reforms that will cause growth of GDP and exports to increase.
Box 1. Macroeconomic Assumptions for the Baseline Scenario
Real GDP grows at about 7 percent until 2011 and 5.8 percent between 2012 and 2026 (Table 1). The projected
increase reflects export diversification, significant improvements in physical infrastructure, and structural
reforms to improve business environment and total factor productivity. Over the longer term, private
consumption would be an important source of growth, due to higher incomes and continued inflows of
remittances.
Inflation rate is projected to decline gradually to about 2½ percent by 2012 and stay at about that level
thereafter. Monetary policy is geared toward achieving this objective.
Exports of goods and services are projected to grow (in US$ terms) at an annual rate of 13.4 percent during
2006-11, and at about 8 percent until 2026. In the long run, exports would be driven by nontraditional exports,
which would grow at an annual rate of 16 percent between 2006 and 2026.
Remittances are assumed to be around 15 percent of annual GDP, while foreign direct investment is
envisaged to average only 4 percent of GDP a year during 2007-11, and stay close to that share until 2026.
Official external grants as a share of GDP are projected to decline slightly, while the official concessional
loans are projected to average about 4 percent of GDP. The reserve coverage of imports would exceed 5
months of goods and services in the outer years.
The tax-to-GDP ratio would rise to 20.5 percent by 2012 as tax administration would strengthen—particularly
in the areas where efficiency gains have not been exhausted, such as customs, exemptions, and the informal
sector.
Structural reforms in PFM and SOEs would continue to improve governance and the efficiency of public
spending. Increased mobilization of domestic revenue together with sustained external financing will allow the
government to finance pro-poor and pro-growth spending, with a view to achieve the MDGs. The wage bill
would be contained through civil service reform and limits on wage increase. The overall budget deficit is
projected to stabilize at around 5.5 percent of GDP.

Borrowing Assumptions
Based on discussions with the authorities and development partners, it is assumed that gross
concessional flows through 2012 do not exceed 7 percent of annual GDP, reflecting a
stabilization after the peak observed in 2003–05. It is also assumed that nonconcessional
borrowing would be in the range of US$200–350 million a year amounting to 1–1.7 percent
of annual GDP between 2007 and 2012 (Table 2), and 1 percent of annual GDP afterwards.

Assumptions on Interest Rates on International Markets
Assumptions about likely interest rates are based on Ghana’s credit rating of B+ and
conservatism on interest rate spreads. It is assumed that present favorable market conditions
might not persist over the projection period, and therefore an annual interest rate of
9.5 percent is used.
Results
The results indicate that Ghana’s risk of external debt distress is in the lower range of

the moderate category. The 2005 World Bank Country Policy and Institutional Assessment
(CPIA) classifies Ghana as a strong performer and assigns the following indicative debtburden thresholds: (i) NPV of debt-to-exports of goods and services of 200 percent, (ii) NPV
of debt-to-GDP of 50 percent, and (iii) debt service of 25 percent of exports of goods and
services.2 Under the baseline scenario, all of Ghana’s external debt-burden indicators remain
below these thresholds during the projection period, reflecting the fact that additional
investment (including from nonconcessional sources) are expected to be growth enhancing.
2

Bank and Fund staffs agreed to apply discretion and continue to use the latest annual CPIA
observation for Ghana as a temporary exception to the three-year rule, to prevent “undue volatility in
the performance rating” as in Staff Guidance Note on the Application of the Joint Fund-Bank
Sustainability Framework for Low-Income Countries (www.imf.org).

33
The historical scenario is based on averages from 1996 to 2005, which includes a period of
macroeconomic destabilization (large nominal depreciation, low export and import growth,
etc. in 2000–01) and HIPC debt relief. In this scenario, all three debt burden indicators
exceed their thresholds towards the end of the projection period. The results underscore the
importance of continued macroeconomic stability while aiming for higher growth.
In the medium term, Ghana’s debt burden trajectory breaches only one of the three
commonly used indicative thresholds (the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio) in only one of the six
standardized stress tests, the combined shock (to real GDP growth, the GDP deflator, exports
growth, and net current transfers). Under this test, Ghana’s NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio rises
from 18 percent in 2006 to 57 percent in 2008, staying above the 50 percent threshold until
2013, declining to about 40 percent thereafter.3 The same shock would also significantly
worsen the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio, which would reach 135 percent in 2008 and
142 percent in 2026. The deterioration of this indicator partly reflects a narrow export base
and vulnerability to terms of trade shocks (Figure 1).
Table 3 illustrates the potential importance of remittance flows to debt sustainability.
Remittance inflows are excluded from standard indicators of debt sustainability; their
inclusion would significantly lower the indicators. For example, the NPV of debt-to-exports
ratio would be about 40 percentage points of GDP lower in 2026 if remittances were
included in foreign exchange earnings.4

This shock adds a half-standard deviation worsening to historical values of the affected variables. Its
impact is magnified in the case of Ghana by a sharp decline in the GDP deflator (leading to a higher
import bill) plus much lower net current transfers, creating large current account deficits in 2007 and
2008. These deficits are then financed primarily at nonconcessional terms.
4

Official remittance inflows are the fastest-growing source of foreign exchange in Ghana. As a share
of GDP, remittances increased from 4 percent in 1995 to about 14 percent in 2006.

34
2. ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS
Alternative A—Baseline Borrowing, Lower GDP and Export Growth
This scenario considers what might happen if GDP and export growth do not accelerate.
Specifically, it assumes lower growth of GDP (average annual growth of 5.3 percent until
2026) and exports (average annual growth of 8 percent until 2026).
On this macroeconomic path, debt distress for Ghana would be moderate, but it would be
notably higher than in the baseline. All thresholds would be exceeded in the historical
scenarios (Figure 2). The GDP-related threshold would be exceeded or reached throughout
the entire the period if Ghana experienced a negative shock to GDP growth, exports, or to
current flows.5

Alternative Scenario B—High Borrowing and Baseline GDP and Export Growth
This scenario assumes that would Ghana borrow US$500-600 million a year (2–3.5 percent
of annual GDP) through 2012 on nonconcessional terms. It also assumes that these amounts
would worsen the terms on which Ghana could borrow by 1 percentage point from all major
creditors. All macroeconomic assumptions are same as in the baseline.
On this higher borrowing path and the baseline macroeconomic path, Ghana would clearly
be at moderate risk of debt distress, but it would also be markedly higher than in the
baseline scenario. All Ghana’s external debt burden indicators are below their thresholds
(Figure 3), but all historical scenarios breach the thresholds. The GDP-related threshold
could be exceeded by a wide margin if Ghana suffered a combined negative shock to its GDP
growth, exports, and FDI.6

Alternative Scenario C—High Borrowing, Lower GDP and Export Growth
This scenario combines borrowing from alternative scenario B (high borrowing) and the
macroframework from alternative scenario A (lower growth of GDP and exports). The
results indicate that in this scenario, Ghana would be approaching high risk of debt
distress, because two of the indicators are at or approaching their policy-dependent
thresholds (NPV of debt -to-exports and debt service-to-exports), and all stress tests are
above the thresholds. The results illustrate that exports (and foreign exchange) constitute one
of the main risks for and constraints on debt sustainability, because the export base is
relatively undiversified (Figure 4).

B. PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
This section discusses the results of the public debt sustainability analysis (DSA) for Ghana
using the new framework for low-income countries.
Main Results
The baseline scenario projects an increase in central government debt (external and
domestic) from about 40 percent of GDP in 2007 to about 50 percent in 2026. The NPV
of debt-to-GDP ratio would increase from about 38 percent in 2006 to about 47 percent
in 2026, due to increased borrowing (Table B). Similarly, the NPV of debt-to-revenue ratio
would rise from 140 percent in 2007 to about 181 percent in 2026. To check the robustness
of the conclusions, we subject this scenario to a number of stress tests.
The sensitivity analyses suggest that the baseline scenario is most vulnerable to a shock
to real GDP growth. If real GDP growth were to stay at historical average minus one
standard deviation in 2008–09, the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio would increase by

36
18 percentage points in 2026, while the NPV of debt-to-revenue ratio would rise by
69 percentage points in 2026 (relative to the baseline).
A shock that maintains the primary deficit at its peak 2006 level would also have a
significant impact on the debt dynamics, raising the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio by about
14 percentage points. This is not surprising as the 2006 primary deficit has been the worst
since 1995.
The baseline scenario remains vulnerable to contingent liabilities. While reliable and
comprehensive data on contingent liabilities are not available, a stress could help gauge the
likely impact of these flows on the debt profile. For example, a 10-percent increase in debt/
GDP resulting from contingent liabilities in 2008 would increase the NPV of debt-to-GDP
ratio by 9 percentage points in 2008 and by about 3 percentage points in 2026. It also would
increase the NPV of debt-to-revenue ratio by 36 percentage points in 2008 and by
12 percentage points in 2026.
Overall, the public debt analysis points to moderate risk of debt distress. Combining
(nominal) external and domestic debt shows that Ghana’s total public debt would increase
from about 40 percent of GDP in 2007 to about 50 percent in 2026 under the baseline
scenario.
Summary
The conclusion of the DSA is that Ghana’s risk of external debt distress is moderate,
albeit close to the low risk category. Even under country-specific alternative scenarios, the
baseline debt trajectory stays below the relevant indicative thresholds. The results of the
country-specific alternative scenarios also indicate, however, that sustainability could
deteriorate in the case of slower than forecast growth and/or increased borrowing on
nonconcessional terms. The risks to total public debt are also moderate. These DSA
results underscore the need for the authorities to maintain sound macroeconomic policies and
accelerate structural reforms to achieve higher GDP growth and diversify exports. While
these measures would reduce Ghana’s vulnerability to exogenous shocks, staying on a
sustainable path would also require that Ghana continues with prudent debt management,
accesses international markets in a gradual and cautious manner, and uses all borrowed funds
judiciously.

II. NONFINANCIAL RELATIONS
IX.

Safeguard Assessment: The Bank of Ghana was subject to a safeguards assessment
with respect to the PRGF arrangement approved on May 9, 2003. The assessment,
which was completed in October 2003, made recommendations for addressing
vulnerabilities in the external audit, financial reporting, internal audit, and internal
controls areas. The authorities confirmed that all proposed measures were
implemented.

X.

Exchange Rate Arrangement: On February 2, 1994, Ghana accepted obligations
under Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3, and 4, of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement. The
authorities describe their exchange rate regime as a managed float. However, the
relative stability of the cedi-US dollar exchange rate suggests that de facto the
exchange rate regime is heavily managed. The system is free of restrictions on
payments and transfers for current international transactions. On March 26, 2007 the
end of period exchange rate for transactions in the interbank market was ¢9,257 per
U.S. dollar.

XI.

Article IV Consultation: On June 20, 2005, the Executive Board concluded the 2005
Article IV Consultation with Ghana (IMF Country Report 05/292) and the third
review of the PRGF arrangement (www.imf.org/external/GHA/index.htm).

XII.

FSAP: Ghana participated in the FSAP in 2000–01, and a Financial System Stability
Assessment (FSSA) was issued to the Executive Board in 2001. An FSAP update was
presented to the Board in December 2003.

48
APPENDIX III. GHANA—IMF-WORLD BANK RELATIONS
(As of April 18, 2007)
I. PARTNERSHIP IN GHANA’S DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY
1.
Ghana’s development objectives are stated in the Ghana Growth and Poverty
Reduction Strategy (GPRS II) presented to parliament in October 2005. The objectives of the
GPRS are to create an environment favorable to private sector–led growth and sustainable
poverty reduction, and to create room within the Government’s budget for increased
expenditures on education, health, and other priority services. The overarching objective of
GPRS II is for Ghana to attain middle-income status by 2015, which entails maintaining
annual real GDP growth rates of at least 6 percent. High real GDP growth rates are expected
to be reflected in turn on positive social change and improvements in the quality of life for
everyone.
2.
The Bank and Fund teams closely coordinate their policy advice to the Ghanaian
authorities. There is collaboration in terms of common objectives and joint support for
implementation of Ghana’s GPRS, through, e.g., joint assessments such as the 2006 Joint
Staff Advisory Note on the GPRS II and the 2005 Annual Progress Report, the 2004 HIPC
Expenditure Tracking Assessment and Action Plan (AAP), the mid-2004 assessment of
progress toward the completion point under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative, and the update of
the findings of the 2000–01 Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP).
3.
The GPRS II, and before that the Ghana Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS I),
created the momentum for a group of development partners (DPs) to align their assistance
through a multidonor budgetary support (MDBS) agreement with the Government of Ghana
(GoG). The GoG and DPs consider the MDBS to be the basis for supporting implementation
of GPRS II through the budget. Building on gains made over the last few years, GoG
representatives and their development partners (nine bilaterals and four multilaterals,
including the World Bank) agreed on February 25, 2005, to work together according to the
principles established in “Harmonization and Alignment in Ghana for Aid Effectiveness: a
Common Approach for Ghana and its Development Partners.” The principles agreed in that
document were made operational at the November 2005 Consultative Group Meeting with
the adoption of a Harmonization and Aid Effectiveness Action Plan.
4.
On June 21, 2006, Ghana held a Consultative Group (CG) meeting to discuss
development results, Government priorities for development investments, the need for
scaled-up DP assistance, and the likely support that would be forthcoming from the donor
partners. The CG documentation included a prioritized result matrix, a progress report on
implementation of the aid harmonization and effectiveness action plan, and a support
overview indicating actual and projected disbursements by DPs by sector and pillar of the
GPRS II. The overview was designed to improve transparency related to alignment of DP
support with national strategies and to increase predictability regarding future funding flows

49
to facilitate preparation of the 2007 national budget. The next CG meeting is scheduled for
June 18-19, 2007, as the Government of Ghana and its Development Partners have adopted
an annual cycle for results, resources, and partnership (RRP) CG policy dialogues, timed to
provide input to the following year’s budget process.
5.
Building on the GPRS II and the Ghana Harmonization and Aid Effectiveness Action
Plan, Ghana’s DPs prepared a Ghana Joint Assistance Strategy (G-JAS), in consultation with
Government and civil society, as a response to the formulation of Government priorities set
out in the GPRS II. The G-JAS was signed on March 1, 2007, and provides the partnership
context for the forthcoming Bank CAS that is expected to be presented to the Bank Board in
June 2007.
II. THE WORLD BANK GROUP COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY AND PORTFOLIO
6.
The Bank Board discussed the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Ghana (FY04–
07), prepared jointly with the International Finance Corporation (IFC), on March 16, 2004.
The CAS was designed to support the GPRS by effectively helping Ghana achieve its
development objectives. In doing so, it complements the interventions of other donors by
focusing on three areas: (i) sustainable growth and job creation, (ii) service provision for
human development, and (iii) governance for empowerment. The Board discussed a CAS
progress report (CAS PR) on June 15, 2006. The CAS PR confirms that the strategy laid out
in the 2004 CAS continues to be relevant for the Bank’s program in Ghana.
7.
The Bank Group strategy is to help the government: (i) maintain the progress made in
achieving macroeconomic stability in recent years while pursuing accelerated growth by
improving the investment climate and harnessing sources of growth; (ii) build human capital
by improving delivery of human development services, and (iii) promote good governance
and public sector reforms. The CAS for Ghana was prepared after consultations with
government and stakeholders, including meetings throughout the country with civil society,
the private sector, and others. The Bank group’s strategy in Ghana also seeks to deepen its
collaboration with other development partners through the MDBS framework, partnership
programs like the Health SWAp, and other sector support, and to further harmonize
approaches in preparing analytical work, joint assessment of fiduciary underpinnings for
sector and general budget support, mission management, and program-based assistance.
8.
Since Board approval of the CAS in March 2004, the Bank program has been
important in financing Ghana’s development program. Total disbursements rose to US$327
million equivalent in FY05 and US$444 million in FY06, about 10 percent of total
government expenditures. Actual disbursements for FY04–07 are projected to reach
US$1,150 million equivalent (including the PRSC-5, with an expected Board presentation on
May 21, 2007). The Bank will have therefore delivered the bulk of the planned CAS program
by mid-2007.

50
9.
The Bank’s cumulative commitments to Ghana as of April 18, 2007, amounted to
US$6 billion for 155 operations. The 23 active projects (including credits to Ghana for
regional projects) total US$1.18 billion, of which US$488 million are still undisbursed. The
portfolio is diverse: it consists of a series of single-tranche Poverty Reduction Support
Credits (PRSCs) for continued support of policies and reforms articulated in the GPRS II,
complemented by programs in health and education, agriculture, energy, roads, community
water, and other infrastructure in both rural and urban areas. Annex 1 summarizes World
Bank operations in Ghana. The performance of the portfolio is generally satisfactory, though
the implementation of some projects is delayed.
10.
Given the emphasis on growth in the GPRS II, the Bank program sharpened its focus
on growth at the mid-term review in June 2006. FY07 operations are concentrated on
supporting government initiatives related to ICT, energy, urban transport, and agricultural
growth. Interventions related to strengthening Ghana’s human development index are also
scheduled for FY07: malaria and nutrition for child survival, health insurance, small towns
water supply and sanitation. Additional financing for economic management capacitybuilding aims to enhance delivery of public services through a scaling up of the public sector
reform program.
11.
Non-lending services include updates of the core diagnostics, as well as targeted
analyses to strengthen the analytical base for the assistance program supported by the FY04–
07 CAS. In FY04, this work consisted of a CFAA update; a country economic memorandum
on public policy, growth, and poverty; a financial sector assessment update; an accounting
and audit assessment; a report on policy options facing the new National Health Insurance
Scheme; a public expenditure review (PER) carried out with other MDBS partners; and a
poverty and social impact analysis (PSIA) that focused on electricity tariffs. In FY05, nonlending services included policy papers on the electricity and petroleum sectors, the joint
WB-DFID-AFD study on natural resource management and economic growth, the external
review of public financial management (ERPFM) prepared with other MDBS partners, and
analytical work on policy options for the GPRS update and on monitoring and evaluation. In
FY06, non-lending services included an update of the external review of public financial
management (ERPFM), prepared with other MDBS partners; a youth and employment study;
and a Country Environmental Assessment (CEA)—also carried out jointly with other
development partners.
III. IMF-WORLD BANK COLLABORATION IN SPECIFIC AREAS
12.
The Bank and Fund teams closely coordinate their policy advice to the Ghanaian
authorities; they have common objectives and together they support Ghana’s GPRS and
determine structural conditionality.
13.
Areas where the Fund leads. The IMF leads the policy dialogue on macroeconomic
policies, such as fiscal and monetary policies. The IMF has supported Ghana’s poverty

51
reduction efforts through several arrangements under the Poverty Reduction and Growth
Facility (PRGF). PRGF reforms have centered on measures to substantially raise revenue to
make room for increased poverty-related spending and development needs, strengthen public
expenditure management, and use monetary policy to achieve single-digit inflation. The sixth
and final review under the PRGF was completed on October 27, 2006. Areas where the
Bank leads. The World Bank leads the policy dialogue on economic reforms in such sectors
as infrastructure, which encompasses energy, roads, and telecommunications, water, and
sanitation; urban and local government; agriculture and rural development; human
development; and private sector development and public sector reform.
•

Infrastructure accounts for about 42 percent of commitments. The Road Sector
Development SIL has the objective of achieving sustainable and regionally equitable
improvements in the supply and performance of road transport services. The Bank
Group’s engagement in energy has grown to include Economic Sector Work (ESW)
and Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA) and investment lending to support
improvements in the operational efficiency of the national utility companies. An IDA
guarantee also supports the country’s participation in the West African Gas Pipeline
project, while an IDA project supports Ghana’s participation in the West Africa
Power Pool (WAPP) through a two phase Adaptable Program Loan (A6PL). Dialogue
on water and sanitation policy has been pivotal to major new investments in urban,
small town, and community water access. In view of their importance for the delivery
of reliable and cost-effective public services, policy issues in the power and water
sectors are also part of the PRSC-supported policy agenda. Based on new
developments in the government’s approach to telecommunications, the Bank Group
is again engaged in dialogue on sector strategy, policy, and regulation through the eGhana project.

•

Agriculture and rural development accounts for about 15 percent of commitments;
the intent is to find sustainable ways to increase agricultural productivity and
diversification, deepen financial intermediation in rural areas, and rehabilitate land,
forest, and wildlife resources. Beyond the cross-cutting issues tackled through the
PRSCs, three IDA operations are supporting this agenda: the Agriculture Services
Sub-Sector Investment (AgSSIP) Project, the Rural Financial Services SIL, and the
Community-Based Rural Development Project, which supports a comprehensive
approach to rural economic growth and poverty reduction. There are also three Global
Environment Facility (GEF) projects in support of the natural resource management
agenda and preservation of biodiversity.

In human development, four projects account for 17 percent of total lending. Bank
support in this area includes the Second Health Sector Support Program (SWAp), the
Education Sector Project, the multi-sector HIV/AIDS program (M-SHAP—also a
sector wide program), and the Regional Treatment Acceleration project (TAP) which
is testing new approaches to accelerating treatment for people living with AIDS. The

52
PRSCs complement existing sector operations, leveraging their poverty focus by
ensuring improved expenditure allocation (amount and structure) and addressing
some of their financing implications for the poor (e.g., removal of school fees for
girls in deprived areas and for disabled pupils across the country, and adopting a fee
exemption policy for maternal deliveries). The PRSC-4 marked the transition from
sector-targeted budget support through the health SWAPs to general budget support
directed to increasing government support to the health sector and sharpening the
focus of government intervention on health outcomes.
•

IDA’s assistance in private sector development represents about 13 percent of Bank
Group commitments. The Trade and Investment Gateway SIL responds to new
government policies; it seeks to attract a critical mass of export-oriented investors to
Ghana to accelerate export-led growth and facilitate trade. The Land Administration
Project will help create a sustainable, fair, efficient, and decentralized land
administration system to increase land tenure security. The PRSCs also support
reforms tackling the high-cost business environment, facilitating trade, and
encouraging financial intermediation. Further Bank Group support to private sector
development is being provided by the Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprise (MSME)
Development Project, which promotes an enabling business environment and helps
improve the capacity, competitiveness, and access to finance of small and medium
enterprises. The joint donor Economic Management Capacity Building Project is
designed to strengthen specific aspects of the financial sector and lay the foundation
for public sector reforms.

14.
Areas of shared responsibility. The IMF and World Bank staffs collaborate closely in
supporting the GoG’s structural reforms in budgeting, expenditure and financial
management, public sector reform and privatization, and the financial sector, as shown
below. Bank support to governance and public sector management is provided mainly
through the PRSC and through programs supporting public sector capacity building and
decentralization.
15.
Budgeting, public expenditure management (PEM), and control. The February 2004
joint Bank-Fund assessment of the government’s PEM capacity confirmed encouraging
progress since 2001, though there was still a need for continued improvement in managing
the budget. That assessment, the FY04 PER, and the FY05 and FY06 External Reviews of
Public Financial Management (ERPFM) identified priority PEM actions being supported by
the PRSC/MDBS. Through the planned ERPFMs, dialogue is expected to continue to support
the country’s efforts to strengthen PFM performance.
16.
Public sector reform. The Fund follows public service reforms through their impact
on macroeconomic aggregates (wage bill, government expenditure) and discusses the
macroeconomic tradeoffs the government faces in supporting a large public sector. Building
on lessons learned, the government prepared a strategy and implementation plan for public

53
sector reform that the cabinet approved in late 2005 and which was officially launched in
March 2006. The Bank’s support for implementing the government strategy takes place in
the context of the PRSCs, the Economic Management Capacity Building project, and through
sector-based operations (such as Urban Water, Roads Sector Development).
17.
Public enterprise reform and divestiture. The Fund monitors the financial position of
large public enterprises in the energy and financial sectors because of their importance for
public finances and macroeconomic stability. Bank dialogue and assistance in this area is
provided through the PRSCs and several sectoral projects. Bank dialogue in the energy
sector, pursued through the PRSC, emphasizes ensuring the financial soundness of the power
utility companies, the completion of the West Africa Gas Pipeline, and setting electricity
tariffs at cost recovery levels.
18.
Financial sector. In July 2003 a joint Bank-IMF mission updated the 2000–01 FSAP.
The Bank of Ghana’s self-assesment showed that there has been full compliance with the
recommendations of the 2003 FSAP Update. Further reforms are now being implemented in
the context of Ghana’s comprehensive Financial Sector Strategic Plan (FINSSP). These
reforms include the recently approved Foreign Exchange Act, which allows foreign investors
to participate in the secondary capital market, and the Credit Reporting Act, which
formalizes the procedures for reporting and sharing information on credit records, thus
contributing to reduce the risks of lending and the cost of borrowing. The PRSCs and the
Economic Management Capacity Building project support implementation of the FINSSP.

APPENDIX IV. GHANA—STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Provision of data to the Fund is broadly adequate for surveillance purposes, but
the quality and timeliness of the data need to be improved. There are also notable
deficiencies in the dissemination of statistical information to the public, as well as in the
reporting for Fund publications, although the situation has improved recently with the
publication on the Bank of Ghana’s Web site of the Monetary Policy Committee Statement,
Statistical Releases, and monthly monetary series for 2001–06. Data for publication in the
International Financial Statistics (IFS) on international transactions were last reported for
2000, on government finances for 1998, and on national accounts for 1997. No monthly or
quarterly fiscal or balance of payments data are currently reported for publication in the IFS.
The latest available data reported for publication in the Government Finance Statistics
Yearbook (GFSY) are for 2004. However, these data cover only the cash revenue and expense
transactions of the budgetary central government. Moreover, there have been long delays in
the release by the Ghana Statistical Service of census and survey results, irregularity in the
quarterly statistical digest, and long lags in the dissemination of data. Ghana is a participant
in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS); its metadata were initially posted on the
Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB) in July 2005. No updates of the
metadata have been received since the original posting.
National accounts and prices
2.
As a result of a methodological change in the compilation of consumer prices in
1999, both the consumer price index (CPI) and the rate of inflation for the 1999-2001
period may be underestimated. This may affect nominal GDP as well, although the impact
on overall GDP is unclear, because agriculture production may have been overstated since
1990. To address problems in the compilation of price statistics and national accounts, a
peripatetic advisor was assigned to Ghana during 2001–04. Follow-up technical assistance
has been provided under the GDDS project for Anglophone Africa. Work on updating the
CPI weights using the fourth Ghana Living Standard Survey (1998/1999) was completed in
mid-2006, and the Ghana Statistical Service (GSS) plans to release the revised CPI series in
2007. STA is also providing ongoing peripatetic TA under the DFID project for the
development of a Producer Price Index (PPI).
3.
The GSS is nearing completion of work on revising the GDP estimates and plans
to release the revised series in 2007. The advisor recruited under the GDDS project is
assisting the GSS in updating the base year for the national accounts to 2002, expanding
compilation to include estimates of expenditure on GDP, and improving sources and
methods. The GSS also plans to compile estimates of quarterly GDP. A comprehensive
overhaul of the basic sources of national accounts data is needed because surveys now used
are outdated.
Labor statistics
4.
The paucity of labor statistics is a cause for concern. Labor statistics are almost
nonexistent, although some wage indicators are available from the Social Security National

56
Insurance Trust (SSNIT). The Ministry of Employment has been receiving technical
assistance from the United Nations Development Program and the International Labor
Organization in the design and compilation of labor statistics.
Public finance
5.
Steps have been taken to improve fiscal data. The Controller Accountant General
Department (CAGD) currently compiles monthly budget implementation reports, and the
data are available within six weeks, although some factors undermine their reliability. There
are, for example, discrepancies in the data reported by the CAGD and the BOG. Above-theline data from the CAGD are narrower in coverage than below-the-line BOG data. The lack
of comprehensive and timely reconciliation of monthly treasury data with bank accounts
undermines data reliability. To address these shortcomings, the government has formed a
committee to define the nature of “broad” and “narrow” government; moved to a system of
immediate booking for “direct debits” and more frequent reporting of government account
balances; and is implementing a new automated Budget and Public Expenditure Management
System (BPEMS). The BPEMS covers ministries, departments, and agencies. However, the
economic classification is not sufficiently detailed for data to be compiled in accordance with
the requirements of GFSM 2001. In June 2006 a STA mission proposed classification of
transactions in line with international guidelines.
6.
There are also problems of data comprehensiveness. The CAGD and the BOG
have been missing a substantial part of central government spending, such as donor flows
disbursed directly to ministries and those arising from internally generated funds. They have
also had difficulties in accounting for expenses paid by extrabudgetary funds. The operations
of special funds, such as the Social Security and National Insurance Trust (SSNIT), the
Ghana Education Trust Fund (GETF) and the District Assemblies Common Fund (DACF),
are not yet covered in the fiscal accounts. Although the majority of local government
expenses are directly met from budgetary accounts, the own revenue of local governments,
all spending of these revenues, and transactions financed from the DACF are not yet covered.
Extending the coverage of fiscal data to general government is strongly encouraged. A new
system for compiling more comprehensive data by the CAGD has been introduced. In
addition, the Commitment Control System has been operating for a full year, and a report for
fiscal year 2005 was generated in January 2006. The GDDS project for Anglophone Africa
has assigned a short-term consultant to advice on coverage and other issues related to the
implementation of the new Government Finance Statistics Manual.
7.
Central government fiscal developments are primarily monitored from belowthe-line BOG data. As no comprehensive audited accounts have been published in the last
few years, above-the-line fiscal aggregates are monitored by a combination of cash-flow data
from the BOG and identifiable components of revenue and expenditure provided by the
Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning (MOFEP) and the CAGD. The BOG produces
revenue, debt service, and domestic financing data. The MOFEP Aid and Debt Management
Unit provides external debt data and information on foreign project loan and grant
disbursements. The CAGD provides data on noninterest recurrent expenditure and
domestically financed capital expenditures. The compilation of a full set of integrated
accounts that record stocks and flows for all the subsectors of the general government, in

57
accordance with GFSM 2001 guidelines, could improve and harmonize the fiscal accounts in
Ghana.
8.
Comprehensive solutions to some of the data problems may have to await full
implementation of the new BPEMS system and incorporation of Fund technical advice.
Various missions from FAD have suggested short-term, temporary solutions to alleviate
current data quality problems. A long-term advisor from FAD has been working on public
expenditure and debt management issues in the Ministry of Finance since August 2001. A
joint Bank-Fund mission in 2004 assessed progress on monitoring poverty-related spending
through the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Assessments and Actions Plans; a
Fiscal Transparency Report on Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) was undertaken
in July 2004; and STA provided further technical assistance in March 2005.
Monetary statistics and international reserves
9.
Monetary and international reserve data were significantly revised in early 2002.
A July 2002 STA mission confirmed that the bridge table used to automatically generate data
on central bank monetary variables and international reserves from BOG’s financial accounts
is complete and reliable. In light of changes in the structure of government accounts at the
BOG that were associated with the introduction of BPEMS, in mid-2003 BOG staff
developed a more detailed automated bridge table for government accounts to facilitate
reconciliation and tracking of the budget. The BOG currently reports monthly data with a lag
of four to six weeks.
10.
The mission also detected shortcomings in the quality of data submitted by
commercial banks, especially in the treatment of foreign-currency-denominated assets and
liabilities, and in the reporting of government securities. To resolve these issues, the mission
helped draft a new report form for commercial banks, which was adopted beginning with
data published for July 2003. BOG reports data from the commercial banks with a lag of
eight to ten weeks.
11.
A January-February 2004 STA mission initiated the adoption of the
standardized report forms (SRFs) for reporting monetary data to the Fund. In 2005,
BOG started to report monetary data using the SRF. An April 2007 STA mission is assisting
the authorities in the finalization of the SRF reporting, expansion of the coverage of
depository corporations to include discount houses, the building society, rural banks and
credit unions, and in launching the collection and compilation of financial statistics with a
view to compile a comprehensive financial corporation survey. .
Debt statistics
12.
The responsibility for external debt recording and payment is divided among
three agencies. The MOFEP, through its Aid and Debt Management Unit (ADMU),
maintains the external debt database. It is responsible for recording debt-payment
obligations, issuing payment requests, and tracking HIPC debt relief. The CAGD confirms
the legality of the payment and authorizes the release of public funds. It is responsible for
accounting for debt payments and rendering reports to parliament. The BOG as the payment

58
agent for the government verifies payments made to ADMU and CAGD.
13.
An FAD technical assistance mission in 2001 concluded that the three institutions
needed to improve the transparency and accountability of external debt management.
The authorities should (i) develop a single computerized database that is available to all three
institutions; (ii) formalize procedures used for settling debt payments (including obtaining
debt notification from donors, delegating signing authorities of officials within the relevant
organizations, and creating registers tracing the movement of the documents required to
effect external debt payment); and (iii) improve the analytical content and timeliness of data,
which are not currently reported at regular intervals.
14.
To enable systematic comparison of the budget, the balance of payments, and the
BOG cash-flow data, the authorities should clearly identify the government subsectors for
which data are reported and prepare a clear classification of financing, outstanding debt, and
guarantees issued.
Trade and balance of payments statistics
15.
Since 1982 the BOG Research Department has had primary responsibility for the
compilation and presentation of the annual and quarterly balance of payments statistics. The
main data sources are the Customs Excise and Preventive Service (CEPS), administrative
data (government ministries and departments within BOG), commercial banks, and the GSS.
In addition, the BOG carries out simple financial surveys on other corporate entities that are
involved in transactions with nonresidents. Data are compiled based on the Balance of
Payments Manual, Fifth Edition (BPM5).
16.
Currently, the GSS is not publishing timely monthly trade statistics, although
the data are available from the CEPS. The staff has recommended that the GSS
collaborate with the CEPS to process customs data within six weeks and with the Ministry of
Trade and Industry (MOT) and the BOG to identify and reduce discrepancies in trade
statistics and to ensure that imports into bonded warehouses are not double-counted. Data
collection procedures of the CEPS need to be improved, and there is also room for improving
trade volume data collected by the CEPS through customs invoices, which would help the
GSS to extract meaningful import and export unit values.
17.
Fund staff has recommended that the GSS produce export unit values for major
export commodities, such as gold and cocoa. A high coverage of the country’s export
bundle can be obtained from just three major exports—cocoa, gold, and unwrought
aluminum. In contrast, deflation of imports is likely to require an iterative procedure to strike
a balance between coverage of the index and its stability, owing to the heterogeneity of the
basket.
18.
The BOG continues to implement the recommendations of a TA mission on
balance of payments statistics in 2000, including surveys of key establishments. (A survey
of shipping companies was introduced in 2004, but the companies at that time were unable to
submit the required data.) Collaboration among the government agencies responsible for data
collection, moreover, has improved. A new immigration form to capture data on travel

59
statistics, in line with the Tourism Satellite Account designed by an inter-institutional
committee, was introduced in March 2005. The survey on private capital flows carried out in
2000 was published, and the BOG intends to implement a second phase of the capital flow
project. Ghana is also benefiting from a GDDS/DFID project being implemented by STA on
strengthening capacity for balance of payments and international investment position
statistics, of which monitoring capital flows is a key component. During February/March
2007, three officials attended the first workshop under the GDDS/DFID project which
focused on design and scope of an annual survey of cross-border financial flows and stocks.

1. Taxes on income and profits

Tax

Domestic and foreign companies
operating in Ghana are taxed on certain
income accruing in, derived from, brought
into, or received in the country. Taxable
income includes net profits and interest,
royalties, and rent income of companies
formed exclusively for real estate
development but does not include
dividends from other companies, which
are taxed at 10%. For domestic
subsidiaries of nonresident companies, a
further floor for net profits is that the
subsidiary's share of the consolidated
group profits should at least be equal to
the subsidiary's share of group turnover.

Nature of Tax

Exemptions include the income
from cocoa farming, income of
other agricultural companies during
their first five years of operation,
income of waste processing
companies during their first seven
years of operation, and the income
of some public corporation and
bodies. Deductions are allowed for
expenditures incurred in the
production of income, including interest and rent. Losses incurred in
farming are offset and can be
carried forward for the five years
after the year in which the loss was
incurred. Until 2002 this provision
was restricted to farming, mining,
and businesses that manufacture
mainly for export. In the 2006
budget, agroprocessing, tourism
and ICT (software) operators were
also added. Since 2006 venture
capital financing companies that
meet the eligibility requirement in
Act 680 have a five-year tax holiday
on corporate income, dividends

Public Information Notice (PIN) No. 07/64
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
June 4, 2007

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with Ghana
On May 18, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Ghana.1
Background
The Ghanaian economy has performed well in recent years with real GDP growing at its fastest
pace since the early 1990s. In 2006, real GDP growth reached 6.2 percent, driven by agriculture
(an exceptionally good cocoa harvest), mining, construction, and services, and in response to
the improved business environment. Large remittance inflows fueled both consumption and
private investment in housing. The economy has thus far proved reasonably resilient to the
energy shortages that began in September 2006, caused by shortfalls in power supply and
surging demand. Inflation declined to 10.5 percent at end-2006, and dipped below 10 percent at
end-March 2007. Falling oil prices in the second half of the year helped reduce inflation, but this
was partially offset by strong demand pressures from large public sector wage increases and a
nominal effective depreciation of the currency. After years of sustained consolidation, the fiscal
deficit (including grants) widened to 7.7 percent of GDP in 2006, more than 2.5 percentage
points higher than in the mid-year supplementary budget. This outcome reflected shortfalls in
revenue from import-related taxes and significant overruns in both wages and subsidies and
transfers to state-owned enterprises in the energy sector. Public sector wage overruns
stemmed from large wage increases in the health sector in the first half of the year, aimed at
retaining skilled labor, which led to demands for additional wage increases in the rest of the
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

77
public sector later in the year. Higher subsidies and transfers to the energy sector reflected the
suspension of pass-through of utility price increases to end users after May 2006. The higher
deficit was financed by nonbank borrowing, in part by issuing local currency (cedi) bonds. As a
result, the trend decline in the ratio of domestic debt to GDP—the authorities’ fiscal anchor—
was reversed.
Ghana continued to accumulate international reserves in 2006, despite a widening of the
external current account deficit. A significant improvement in the trade deficit as a share of
GDP, helped by terms-of-trade gains and strong export growth, was more than offset by a
decline in project grants. But strong capital inflows helped raise gross international reserves to
slightly over 3 months of imports. Thanks to massive debt relief under the Heavily Indebted
Poor Countries Initiative (HIPC) and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) and good
macroeconomic policies, Ghana’s external debt dropped to just 22 percent in 2006 from about
120 percent of GDP in 2000.
Progress was made with some structural reforms, though others have been delayed. Public
Financial Management (PFM) has been strengthened through improvements in fiscal reporting,
treasury reform, and deployment of the new computerized payroll management system. The
monthly reviews of petroleum product pricing introduced in April 2006 are proceeding smoothly.
On the other hand, progress in public and civil service sector reforms has been slow, although it
is now being stepped-up. Tariff increases for electricity and water, which should have been put
into effect in May 2006, were gazetted in November but not passed on to consumers. Special
energy tariffs for mines and Volta Aluminum Company (VALCO), the aluminum smelter,
contributed to below-cost recovery prices for the Volta River Authority (VRA), the main
stateowned energy producer. VALCO has recently been closed and as part of the authorities’
fiscal package to address the 2006 fiscal slippage, the utility regulation system is being
reinstated beginning in May 2007.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Ghanaian authorities for their continued implementation of
sound economic policies and structural reforms, which have contributed to strong economic
growth—the highest since the early 1990s—sizable disinflation, and a vibrant and resilient
private sector. This favorable policy setting now provides Ghana with a unique opportunity to
achieve the Millennium Development Goals, provided the expectations of rapidly rising income
are managed skillfully. This will require the authorities to advance their strategy to accelerate
growth prudently, while ensuring that macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability are
preserved. Directors underscored the importance of selecting projects that would ease energy
supply bottlenecks, given the associated risks to the positive outlook.
Directors supported the package of policy measures put in place by the authorities to address
the fiscal slippages that developed in 2006, and a few Directors felt that there might even be
scope for a stronger fiscal effort. Directors stressed that timely implementation of the package
will be critical. In particular, the authorities’ plans to reinstate the utility tariff regulation system
with a commitment to full cost recovery and to accelerate divesture will be key to easing future
burdens on the budget. It will also be important to follow through on the commitment to

78
streamlining the wage-setting process and speeding up civil service reform. Directors supported
the authorities’ plans to introduce a fiscal responsibility law and their consideration of shifting to
a total public debt-to-GDP ratio as fiscal anchor.
Directors welcomed the recent decline in inflation to single digits. Continued close monitoring of
possible price pressures along with implementation of the planned fiscal measures will be
important going forward. Directors commended the central bank’s progress in building capacity
for inflation targeting, and encouraged the continued strengthening of the environment for
effective inflation targeting. This would involve perseverance with ongoing financial sector
reforms, which should enhance the monetary policy transmission mechanism, and the gradual
easing of foreign exchange controls, which—as financial sector development deepens—would
enhance the operation of the foreign exchange market and support greater exchange rate
flexibility over time. A few Directors noted that further enhancing the central bank’s
communications strategy will also be important.
Directors welcomed the soundness of Ghana’s banking system and the authorities’ record on
compliance with the recommendations of the 2003 Financial Sector Assessment Program
update. They underscored that rapid financial deepening, while important to support private
sector–led investment and growth, requires continued supervisory vigilance and enhancement
of the regulatory framework.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ focus on structural reforms critical for higher growth. Public
expenditure tracking surveys and the new value-for-money unit to vet public investment projects
should help deliver public services more efficiently. Directors supported plans to scale up
private sector participation in infrastructure projects through public-private partnerships, which
should be underpinned by strong legal and management frameworks.
Directors noted that absent the scaling up of donor assistance in the near future, Ghana has
decided to access the international capital market to finance prudently selected infrastructure
projects needed for achieving its growth and poverty reduction goals. While recognizing that this
strategy could yield a successful outcome, Directors stressed that it will involve challenges for
maintaining debt sustainability, and welcomed the authorities’ assurance that debt sustainability
will remain at the center of their macroeconomic framework. The joint Fund-Bank debt
sustainability analysis indicates that the risks to Ghana’s external debt distress are moderate—
albeit closer to the lower risk category—but the strong economic growth on which this outcome
depends will require sustained solid policy performance. Directors urged the authorities to
continue to explore avenues for concessional borrowing, and to exercise caution as they
implement their borrowing strategy, making sure that any drawings on nonconcessional terms
are gradual, and supported by solid institutional capacity for project selection and effective debt
management. They also stressed the importance of linking the financing strategy to the
medium-term expenditure framework, continuing efforts to free up resources through efficiency
gains, and reallocating resources towards their most productive uses.

79
Directors considered that the ex-post assessment (EPA) provides a balanced analysis of
Ghana’s program engagement with the Fund since the mid 1990s. They highlighted the role
played by the Fund, along with other donors, in helping Ghana to achieve macroeconomic
stability and more rapid growth. Directors supported the EPA’s message that Ghana’s success
is largely embedded in the strengthening of Ghana’s institutions allowing for effective ownership
of the reforms. Directors considered that the Fund should continue to support Ghana’s efforts to
strengthen the institutions and implement structural reforms crucial for maintaining
macroeconomic stability and achieving its development goals. In this regard, they welcomed the
consideration being given by the authorities to modalities for future engagement with the Fund,
possibly in the context of a Policy Support Instrument.

Statement by Abbas Mirakhor, Executive Director for Ghana
May 18, 2007
1.
The candid and concise staff report reflects well the open and frank discussions with
the authorities who appreciate the significant value added in this consultation. The constructive
and collaborative efforts of the authorities and staff of the IMF/WB have resulted in a report
that acknowledges the achievements of the authorities and recognizes the historic opportunity
of the present stage of the evolution of Ghana’s economy. It appropriately identifies the
challenges, realistically assesses the resource constraints, and pragmatically maps out policy
responses to accelerate growth and meet the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) while
preserving macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability. The authorities express
appreciation for the high-quality policy dialogue, and the recent technical assistance from
MCM, including a mission to advise them on access to the international capital markets. They
also extend their gratitude for continued support of management and the Executive Board.
2.
Ghana’s achievements include a marked increase in per capita GDP; significant
reduction in poverty; sizable disinflation; reduced economic vulnerabilities; and strengthened
institutions that have enhanced governance and democracy and fostered socio-political
harmony and stability. Ghana has benefited from IMF financial and technical support which
has been instrumental in this progress. This performance, along with strengthened business
environment, has boosted confidence and earned higher rating for Ghana as well as recognition
for rapid progress in the Ease of Doing Business Index. The authorities are committed to
sustaining this strong performance to accelerate progress toward achieving the MDGs.
3.
Economic performance improved further in 2006, with strong growth, decline in
inflation, and further accumulation of reserves. The fiscal deficit, however, increased as a
result of revenue shortfall and expenditure overruns. The latter, to a large extent, is the result
of one-off expenditures. A severe energy crisis due to region-wide drought affecting
hydropower generation has meant higher subsidies to the energy and water sectors as well as
spending on critical investments in these sectors. Public sector wages also increased, most of
which went to the critical health and education sectors, where Ghana faces major manpower
shortage. Some of these expenditures were associated with the 50th Independence Anniversary
celebration and the leadership role of Ghana on the continent, including hosting of the
upcoming African Union Conference. Other one-off expenditures were in respect to purchase
of equipment for the security agencies and spending on the National Identification program.
The authorities, in consultation with staff, have designed a package of measures to reduce the
deficit.

82
4.
The staff report recognizes, perceptively, that the most important challenges ahead are
to accelerate growth and achieve the MDGs against the backdrop of unlikely scaling up of
concessional financial assistance, while maintaining macroeconomic stability and debt
sustainability. To ensure macroeconomic stability, measures are being taken to reduce the
fiscal deficit in 2007 and over the medium term. On the expenditure side, spending on
nonessential investments is to be curtailed along with subsidies and transfers with the adoption
of a system of cost-recovery energy and utility tariffs, which is being implemented. The public
sector wage-setting process is to be streamlined, linking real wage increases to productivity
increases. Civil service reform will attempt to rightsize the service while promoting efficiency
and improve remuneration. Additional revenue is expected from strengthening tax
administration, broadening the base, including by reducing the scope of exemptions, and
intensified collection of arrears. Progress in implementation of PFM is expected, including in
fiscal reporting, treasury reform, and deployment of the new automated payroll management
system. The authorities see merit in shifting to total public debt/GDP as the new fiscal anchor,
in view of the fact that the traditional line between ‘domestic’ and ‘external’ debt is blurred, to
focus on overall debt sustainability. A fiscal responsibility law is under discussion, building on
the 2003 Financial Administration Act, to underpin fiscal discipline and anchor expectations.
To preserve debt sustainability, the authorities are planning a debt management framework
consistent with the best international practice, hopefully, with the assistance of their
development partners.
5.
Monetary policy will continue focusing on its primary objective of targeting inflation.
Recognizing the detrimental effect of exchange rate instability, monetary policy began in
earnest in 2001 to target inflation and shift the focus of the Government and the public away
from exchange rate fluctuations to inflation. The documents before the Board reflect well the
effective success of this strategy. Considerable effort has been devoted to developing the
infrastructure for adoption of an inflation-targeting (IT) framework, with much appreciated
technical assistance from the Bank of England. Some of the institutional infrastructure and
conditions for IT are already in place, while progress is being made on others. The staff report
appropriately refers to the present monetary regime as “IT lite,” suggesting that “there seems
to be a secondary policy objective for the exchange rate in support of the inflation target.” It is
worth noting that according to the findings of a number of studies on IT, choice of secondary
policy objectives, including exchange rate, is not inconsistent with “IT lite” regimes. While the
authorities appreciate the acknowledgement that the exchange rate regime of Ghana does not
serve as a monetary anchor, they do not agree with the assessment that the exchange rate is
“heavily” managed. In their view, neither the fact of exchange rate stability nor the statutory
responsibility for market intervention logically constitute prima facie evidence of intervention
beyond that necessary for smoothing purposes.

6.
As the staff report suggests, the financial system is sound, with adequate capitalization,
liquidity and high profitability. Nonperforming loans are at a fairly low level and loan
provisioning is adequate. The Bank of Ghana is in full compliance with recommendations of
the 2003 FSAP update. The authorities will continue to promote competition, efficiency, and
deepening in the financial sector. Supervision will be reinforced and banks will be encouraged
to strengthen their risk management practices. Domestic capital market development remains a
prime goal to promote alternative sources of financing.
7.
The authorities are committed to building on the progress in structural reforms to
strengthen further the productive potential of the economy and position it well to achieve the
accelerated growth projected over the medium term. In the energy sector, additional generation
capacity is being installed to address the ongoing power crisis and mitigate its potential effect
on economic activity. Subsidies that were provided to the energy and utilities sectors in the
face of the ongoing crisis will be curtailed as cost-recovery tariffs are being reinstated while
measures are implemented to improve efficiency of services. The authorities will continue to
improve the business environment and strengthen private sector development. In this regard,
the divestiture process will be accelerated, particularly in the oil and telecommunications
sectors. Active private sector participation in major infrastructure projects will be encouraged
through public-private partnerships. The regulatory burden will be reduced and protection of
private property and investments will be improved. Strengthening good governance further
remains a priority of the Government and the relevant institutions will be given the necessary
support to carry out their respective mandates effectively.
8.
The medium-term outlook remains positive, with strong growth projected, and inflation
expected to decline to low single digits. The overall fiscal deficit will stabilize slightly below 6
percent of GDP and, along with prudent debt policy, contribute to a reduction in total public
debt to about 40 percent of GDP. Progress toward the MDGs is continuing. The poverty goal
is within reach, but more progress is needed in the health, water, and sanitation sectors, where
additional resource availability and enhanced spending efficiencies would be required. As the
joint IMF-World Bank DSA confirms, Ghana’s debt is sustainable and the risk of distress is
moderate to low. The authorities appreciate the recognition and the acknowledgement that
scaling up of concessional assistance is no longer reliable to anchor infrastructure investments
urgently needed to remove supply-side bottlenecks. Therefore, access to minimal level of
nonconcessional financing is imperative. Such levels of resort to external saving to carry out
critical investments will not jeopardize the debt profile to the extent that these investments are
expected to induce active supply response, have high returns, and enhance growth. The
authorities recognize that supportive macroeconomic and reform policies, together with
judicious borrowing policy, are critical to long-term debt sustainability. Decisions regarding

84
further liberalization of the capital account and the foreign exchange market will be made in
consideration of the associated risks and the need to ensure orderly foreign currency flows.
9.
The authorities recognize and value the perceptible paradigm shift in surveillance
toward key macroeconomic and structural policy issues and their interlinkages as
demonstrated in this Article IV consultation. Its value added has served to strengthen
Ghana/IMF relations. The authorities will maintain a close relationship with the IMF to
continue to benefit from its sound policy advice and advocacy for international assistance to
support Ghana’s developmental efforts. They have taken note of staff’s suggestion for a
follow-up formal engagement. The candid policy discussions and close collaboration with staff
have produced the fundamental building blocks of a solid framework that has crystallized their
vision of a home-grown program that—anchored by strong macroeconomic policies and
structural reform—can mobilize additional financial resources from a domestic financial sector
that is to be well developed as well as from the international capital markets. An important
anchor of such a program will be the establishment of a cutting-edge debt management
framework to assist in maintaining debt sustainability. In short, the core building block of the
program envisioned by the authorities includes orderly and prudent access to the international
capital market, sound development of a domestic financial market, and a debt management
framework of best-international-practice quality. The authorities intend to manage
expectations prudently in order to maintain macroeconomic stability and support to the reform
process, especially during this pre-election period. The authorities consider the IMF as an
important partner in their effort to achieve the full potential of the historic opportunity to
accelerate growth and reduce poverty at a faster pace than has been possible thus far. The
authorities, once more, register their appreciation for the strong support from Ghana’s
development partners in the form of financial and technical assistance and debt relief. They
continue to count on this support, which remains critical for Ghana to remain on track to
achieve the MDGs and middle-income status by 2015.
