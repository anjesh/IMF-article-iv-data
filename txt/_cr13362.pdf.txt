STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
November 1, 2013

KEY ISSUES
Context: A slowdown in growth in major emerging market economies (EMEs) and
decline in commodity prices, and more recently, a reversal in push factors tied to a
prospective exit from extraordinarily easy global monetary conditions, has put pressure
on Indonesia’s balance of payments and heightened its vulnerability to shocks. Domestic
policy accommodation and rising energy subsidies have also given rise to increased
external and fiscal imbalances. Recent policy tightening, fuel price hikes, and exchange
rate flexibility have been firmly aimed at reducing these pressures. Against this
backdrop, discussions centered on actions needed to further buttress policy buffers in
the face of heightened market volatility and to reduce structural impediments in support
of broad-based growth.
Outlook and risks: Growth is projected to slow to 5−5½ percent in 2013 and 2014.
Inflation will likely peak at just below 10 percent at end­2013, due mainly to the one-off
effect of June fuel price increases and recent rupiah depreciation. The current account
deficit is expected to exceed 3 percent of GDP in 2013 and 2014 on weak commodity
exports. Reserves have also come under pressure, partly due to Bank Indonesia’s heavy
intervention in the foreign exchange market in mid-2013 in order to stem the rupiah’s
depreciation. In the near term, downside risks relate externally to a further adverse shift
in funding conditions in EMEs and/or weaker-than-anticipated growth in these
economies, notably spillovers from China and India, and domestically to a further
weakening in investor sentiment, prompted by adverse external conditions and/or policy
uncertainty.
Key policy recommendations: Recent market volatility and reserve losses highlight the
need to deal decisively with macroeconomic imbalances and contain financial stability
risks. The current delay in tapering of unconventional monetary policies provides an
opportunity to strengthen policy and financial buffers and improve market perceptions.
Monetary policy should remain focused on anchoring inflation expectations and
reducing balance of payments pressures; fiscal policy should support monetary policy in
this effort, led by tax and subsidy reforms; and the exchange rate and bond yields should
continue to reflect market conditions in order to facilitate an orderly adjustment to a
shifting global environment. Careful monitoring of banks as financial conditions tighten
and a firm closing of the gaps in the crisis management framework are needed to keep
financial stability risks in check. Structural reforms should focus on a more predictable
business climate and greater labor market flexibility.

BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT
1.
The 2013 Article IV consultation took place against the backdrop of slowing growth
and widening macro-imbalances in Indonesia. Following the global financial crisis, rapid growth
in other emerging market economies (EMEs), among them several of Indonesia’s major trading
partners, and buoyant commodity prices, coupled with extraordinarily easy global monetary
conditions, helped bolster exports, drive capital inflows, and boost domestic demand in support of
strong growth. However, tailwinds that propelled EME growth and commodity price increases
dissipated in the past two years, affecting Indonesia’s main exports, but accommodative monetary
and fiscal policies continued to buoy private investment and import demand, adding to pressures on
the current account. Rising energy subsidy costs also drove oil and gas imports and fiscal deficits
higher. As a result, Indonesia slipped into a current account deficit for the first time in more than a
decade in 2012. Growth is projected to slow due to external and domestic factors, and external and
fiscal imbalances are expected to widen in 2013, notwithstanding recent policy measures, with both
structural and cyclical forces at play.
2.
A recent reversal in capital flows has added to balance of payments (BOP) pressures
and raised funding costs in Indonesia. Prospects of a tapering in unconventional monetary
policies (UMPs) in the United States prompted a marked shift in funding conditions and sharp
reversal in capital inflows for a number of EMEs in May 2013, especially in those countries with large
external and/or fiscal imbalances. Among major EMEs, Indonesia has been one of the most seriously
affected by recent market volatility (Figures 2 and 3). Since May 22, net bond and equity outflows
have totaled US$2.7 billion (to end-October), notwithstanding sizable bond inflows recently in
response to policy tightening and a delay in UMP tapering. Yields on rupiah and U.S. dollar debt
rose to their highest levels in more than two years in August, while the main Jakarta stock index
declined sharply, although it is well off its August low (see text table). The rupiah has depreciated by
17 percent against the U.S. dollar so far in 2013, with most of this occurring since July. In the months
preceding this, Bank Indonesia (BI) had intervened heavily in foreign exchange (FX) market and used
moral suasion to prevent a rupiah depreciation, which led to sizable reserve losses and reduced FX
market liquidity. As a result, the wedge between onshore and offshore rates reached as much as
5 percent in mid­2013, but has since diminished with greater exchange rate flexibility.
3.
In response, the authorities have taken significant steps lately to reduce
macroeconomic imbalances and manage inward spillovers, which has helped reduce volatility
(Box 1). To address external and fiscal imbalances, the government raised subsidized fuel prices in
June 2013 by 33 percent on average—the first change in prices since 2009, when gasoline price
increases in 2008 were reversed. Bank Indonesia also began raising policy rates in June to contain
BOP and inflation pressures, including anticipated second-round effects of fuel price increases. In
support, both the exchange rate and bond yields are now being allowed to adjust more freely in line
with market conditions. Finally, the government policy package was announced in August 2013
aimed at reining in the current account deficit, containing wage and food price inflation, and
boosting investment and employment, mainly through limited tax and investment incentives.

Box 1. Indonesia—Recent Policy Measures (Through September 2013)
Since May 2013, the government and Bank Indonesia have announced or implemented a series of measures (summarized
below) aimed at reducing macroeconomic imbalances, neutralizing inflation pressures, and maintaining financial stability, as
well as containing employment losses.
Monetary Policy and Liquidity Management
Bank Indonesia (BI):

 Raised both the policy rate and the overnight deposit facility rate (bottom of interest rate corridor) starting in
June 2013 by a total 150 bps to 7.25 percent and 5.5 percent, respectively.

 Introduced tradable central bank rupiah deposits at one- and six-month tenors in September to facilitate interbank
money market development, and allowed these instruments to be treated as required reserves.

 Shortened the minimum holding period for central bank bills (SBIs) from six months to one month from mid
September to increase their liquidity.

Exchange Rate Policy and Foreign Exchange Market Operations

 Commenced biweekly auctions of foreign exchange (FX) swaps with resident banks in July 2013; allowed derivative

positions held by banks with their customers to be passed on to BI through the swap auctions starting August 2013.

 Broadened the maturities of U.S. dollar term deposits placed by banks with BI from August.
 Relaxed the rules in August on FX purchases by exporters that have converted their export proceeds.
 Relaxed regulations in August on banks' short-term foreign borrowing (currently capped at 30 percent of their capital)
mainly by exempting demand deposits of nonresidents used for investment activities in Indonesia and demand
deposits of nonresidents that contain divestment funds.

Macroprudential Controls

 Tightened loan-to-valuation (LTV) limits on mortgages for second and third residential properties in September 2013.
Additionally, raised LTV limits for motor vehicles.

 Raised the secondary reserve requirement (RR) in September (fulfilled by banks’ holding of treasury and BI securities)
from 2.5 percent to 4 percent, to be phased in by December 2013; also tightened the loan-to-deposit ratio (LDR)
linked RR by lowering its applicability to banks with an LDR in excess of 92 percent (from 100 percent) and with a
capital adequacy ratio of less than 14 percent.

Fiscal Policy

 Increased subsidized petrol price by 44 percent and subsidized diesel price by 22 percent in mid­June 2013, and
approved in the revised 2013 budget a temporary cash compensation scheme for vulnerable groups.

 Announced in August the allowance of temporary deductions and deferred payments of income tax for the rest of
2013 for certain labor-intensive and export-oriented industries.

 Eliminated luxury taxes on more common use goods previously classified as luxury items (certain televisions and
appliances) in August.

 Increased the quantity of biodiesel usage to 10 percent in diesel fuel to reduce oil imports in August.
 Relaxed regulations in August on bonded zones through simplification of licensing procedures and increasing
the allocation of certain goods for local sale.
Other Measures

 Changed the mechanism for importing beef and horticultural products in September 2013, moving away from strict

quotas to a system that will halt imports when the domestic price falls below the reference price and allow imports to
resume if the domestic price exceeds the reference price.

 Expanded the share of sales that industries in bonded zones can derive domestically in August to 50 percent from
25 percent, reversing a 2011 decision to restrict these sales.

 Announced plans in August to issue a presidential decree guiding regional minimum wage setting in 2014.

In this context, policy discussions focused on ensuring an orderly transition to and
mitigating risks associated with a more challenging global and domestic environment. Despite
the growth slowdown, staff emphasized the need to focus immediate policy actions on containing
external and fiscal imbalances and managing financial market pressures through the clear pursuit of
appropriate macro-policy tightening, supported by further adjustments in exchange and interest
rates. Enhanced readiness of the government’s crisis management framework and close monitoring
of bank and corporate vulnerabilities would help mitigate spillover risks to the financial system. The
possible peak in a commodity price super-cycle, deterioration in the current account balance, and
expected slowdown in growth in Indonesia over the near to medium term highlight the need for
structural reforms aimed at broadening the manufacturing and export base, creating more formal
sector employment, and improving long-run growth prospects.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK, AND RISKS
A. Recent Developments and the Near-Term Outlook
5.
Recent macroeconomic developments have been less favorable than envisaged at the
time of the last Article IV consultation, with near-term projections showing slower growth, higher
inflation, and more intense BOP pressures.


Real GDP growth is expected to slow to 5‒5½ percent in 2013 and 2014 from 6¼ percent
in 2012 due to a combination of external and domestic factors, in particular sluggish
investment (including FDI), weaker external demand, and tighter funding conditions
(Table 1). In the first half of 2013, growth was slightly under 6 percent (y/y), with both

investment and consumption slowing, resulting in a falloff in import demand (Figure 4).
However, the decline in export growth, in U.S. dollar terms, was even sharper, although
mainly due to price effects.


Headline inflation is expected to peak at 9.5 percent (y/y) at end­2013 before moderating,
reflecting the June subsidized fuel price increases and some second­round effects, as well as
exchange rate pass-through and demand pull factors. It was 8.4 percent in September 2013,
up from 4.3 percent at end­2012. The core rate (less food and fuel), which bottomed out at
4.0 percent in May, increased to 4.7 percent in September—its highest level in two years.



The current account deficit is projected to widen to 3½ percent of GDP in 2013 (Table 2
and Figure 5). Although non-oil import growth has fallen, it will likely be more than offset by
declining commodity exports. Some improvement is expected in 2014 given the exchange
rate depreciation and policy adjustments, but the deficit is still likely to remain above
3 percent of GDP only on a modest global recovery and still-soft commodity prices.



The overall BOP is projected to show a sizable deficit in 2013, as net FDI and portfolio
inflows ease off on greater uncertainty and EME asset repricing. As a result, reserves, which
were US$96 billion at end-September, are expected to fall to around US$89 billion at
end­2013 (4.9 months of imports or 155 percent of short-term debt), compared to
US$113 billion at end-2012 (6.4 months of imports or 206 percent of short-term debt).1

B. Risks and Prospects
6.
Risks are to the downside, as detailed in the Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM)
(Appendix 1). At present, inward spillovers come mainly through the trade channel (via export
demand and commodity prices) and net inflows in the financial account. In the near term, key
external risks are protracted economic and financial volatility, especially in EMEs, and a fiscal policy
shock in the United States, while in the medium term, they entail a sharper-than-envisaged
slowdown of growth in China, as well as in other large EMEs. The biggest impact would be on
growth and on external and fiscal sustainability, which could be undermined by weaker external
demand, lower commodity prices, and greater global risk aversion. Currently, vulnerability indicators
(Table 3) already point to some elevated risks in these areas. Domestic risks center on a weakening
in investor sentiment, prompted by adverse external conditions and policy uncertainty in Indonesia,
which could exacerbate external and fiscal imbalances and feed back into confidence, while over the
near to medium term, they concentrate on bank distress induced by a sharper-than-envisaged
squeeze on liquidity and/or slowdown in economic activity and on prolonged inaction on key
structural reforms needed to boost productivity and competitiveness.

Gross reserves include predetermined drains identified in the IMF’s standard reserves template. These drains mainly
comprise principal and interest payments on BI and central government foreign currency debt falling due within the
next 12 months, short-term foreign currency deposits of resident institutions, and net forward and swap positions of
less than 12 months of remaining maturity. They increased to US$21.7 billion at end-August from US$17.7 billion at
end‐May, with about US$3 billion of this rise due to net forward and swap positions set to expire by end‐2013.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

INDONESIA

7.
Medium-term prospects. Assuming Indonesia can manage these risks, restore a stable
macroeconomic environment, and step up structural reforms, growth over the medium term is
expected to average 6 percent, in line with trend (Table 4), but lower than the 6½−7 percent
projected during the last consultation, owing mainly to tighter financial conditions, weaker global
prospects, and persistent supply bottlenecks. Domestic demand would continue to be the main
growth driver, but this pace requires firm resolve to reduce structural impediments. The baseline
assumes that energy subsidies are phased out by 2018, with some interim savings redirected to
larger development spending. Reforms would also need to focus on increasing labor market
flexibility, rationalizing the trade and investment regime, and deepening financial markets. Under
this baseline, the current account deficit would narrow to 2½ percent of GDP in the medium term,
with structural forces linked to Indonesia’s dependence on commodity exports, stagnant oil and gas
production, and other competitiveness challenges partially offsetting more favorable cyclical forces
tied to improved global prospects. Gross FDI would stay at around 2 percent of GDP, thereby
reducing the dependence on portfolio inflows. Reserves would stabilize at around 3½ months of
imports and 100−120 percent of short-term debt.
8.
Authorities’ views. The authorities are more optimistic about near-term prospects than
staff, expecting growth to slow less in 2013 on more favorable domestic conditions and to recover
more in 2014 on a more favorable global outlook and election year spending, with parliamentary
and presidential elections slated for mid­2014. On inflation, views are broadly aligned for 2013, but
the authorities believe recent policy tightening and more benign exchange rate pass-through will
bring inflation back within BI’s target band (4.5±1 percent) in 2014. The authorities also expect the
current account deficit to widen only slightly in 2013 to around 3 percent of GDP on improved
export performance and fuel import reduction in the second half of the year. They anticipate it will
narrow more than envisaged by staff in 2014 and over the medium term due to regional and global
factors and domestic reforms.

C. External Position and Debt Sustainability
9.
The external position appears moderately weaker than implied by medium­term
fundamentals and desirable policies (Box 2). An analysis of factors that led to its deterioration in
recent years suggests a combination of cyclical and structural forces were at play (Appendix 2). In
the 2013 Pilot External Sector Report—Individual Economy Assessments, the external balance
assessment (EBA) approach estimated Indonesia’s cyclically-adjusted current account balance was
0−2 percent of GDP weaker than suggested by fundamentals and desired policies. For 2013, despite
the slowdown in growth, the larger fiscal deficit implies that Indonesia’s cyclically-adjusted current
account balance is about 1−3 percent of GDP weaker than the norm. On the capital and financial
account, the ongoing reliance on portfolio flows poses added risks. Capital flow management
measures introduced in 2010 were partially reversed in August 2013, highlighted by a reduction in
the holding period for BI securities. Indonesia’s projected reserves at end-2013 are adequate based
on standard debt and import metrics but relatively low when assessed in relation to the IMF’s
composite

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

INDONESIA

Box 2. Indonesia—External Assessment 1/
Overall assessment. Indonesia’s external position remains moderately weaker
than implied by medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies. Compared
with trading partners, Indonesia’s young labor force, low relative income, and
more rapid growth tend to improve its current account balance (CAB), while low
social spending and capital controls tend to weaken it. Based on the IMF’s
external balances assessment (EBA) methodology, Indonesia’s current account
norm was −½ to −2½ percent of GDP in 2012 while its cyclically adjusted CAB
was −2.2 percent of GDP, 0−2 percentage points of GDP weaker than the norm.
The EBA external sustainability approach estimates that a CAB of -2.7 percent of
GDP would stabilize Indonesia’s net foreign asset (NFA) position at -38 percent of
GDP.
Policy responses. Macroeconomic policies and structural reforms should be
implemented to reduce the current account deficit and raise foreign reserves over
the medium term. Policies should aim at cutting the fiscal deficit moderately
(mainly by eliminating energy subsidies), tightening monetary policy, as
appropriate, and allowing the exchange rate to adjust flexibly. Reforms are also
needed to increase labor market flexibility, improve the trade and investment
regimes, and reduce policy uncertainties.
Current account. In 2012, weak commodity prices, falling oil and gas exports, and
strong imports caused the CAB to weaken by 3 percentage points to −2.8 percent
of GDP. The widening of the fiscal deficit had relatively limited impact (less than
0.3 percentage points of GDP). With slowing economic growth and a larger fiscal
imbalance expected in 2013, staff estimate that Indonesia’s cyclically adjusted CAB
will weaken by a further 0.6 percentage points to −3.3 percent of GDP, about
1−3 percentage points of GDP weaker than implied by medium-term
fundamentals and desired policies.

Real exchange rate. The EBA REER model suggests the 2012 REER was in line with fundamentals and desirable policies. By
September 2013, the REER had fallen a further 8½ percent, suggesting possible undervaluation. However, based on the
worsening CAB and large residual in the REER approach, staff believe the macrobalance approach gives a more accurate
assessment of Indonesia’s external position. Using standard elasticities, the depreciation so far in 2013 (if maintained) would
improve the CAB by about 1¼ percentage points of GDP over the medium term.
Capital account. Staff estimate that foreign direct investment (FDI) will remain about 2 percent of GDP over the medium term.
Investors rate Indonesia highest on market size and the macroeconomic environment, but suggest a need to improve labor
markets, business startup procedures, contract enforcement, and infrastructure. Portfolio flows have been volatile, but so far in
2013 equity outflows (net) have been small (0.1 percent of GDP), while bond inflows (net) have held up well (1 percent of GDP),
notwithstanding mid-year pressures. Still, Indonesia remains vulnerable to a slowdown or reversal in capital inflows due to
increased global risk aversion, unwinding of global monetary accommodation, or weaker investor sentiment. Some easing in
capital controls has occurred with the recent reduction in the holding period on Bank Indonesia (BI) securities.
Foreign reserves and intervention. In the first half of 2013, BI intervened to smooth volatility and support the rupiah. As a
result, official reserves fell from US$113 billion at end­December 2012 to US$93 billion at end­July 2013, before stabilizing. Staff
project reserves will decline to US$89 billion at end­2013 (at the low end of the recommended range of 100−150 percent on
the IMF’s composite reserve adequacy metric).
External assets and liabilities. Indonesia’s net foreign asset position at end-2012 stood at -41 percent of GDP, comprising
reserves (+13 percent of GDP), net FDI and equities (-34 percent of GDP), and net debt and other liabilities (-20 percent of
GDP). External asset and liability ratios are expected to stay fairly constant over the medium term and do not appear as a
significant vulnerability given the relatively low level of debt and other liabilities.

metric. Going forward, the recent depreciation of the real effective exchange rate (REER) would be
expected to narrow Indonesia’s current account deficit by about one percentage point of GDP.
Additional policy reforms would be needed to close the gap fully over the medium term. A further
modest reduction in reserves may be appropriate to smooth exchange rate volatility and cushion
against temporary external shocks, but rebuilding them over the medium term is essential to guard
against future risks. Both external and public debt are projected to rise slightly over the near term
(as a share of GDP), but remain at relatively low levels. The Debt Sustainability Analysis (Appendix 3)
indicates that the debt profile is resilient to standard shocks.
10.
Contingent financing and swaps. In the face of more volatile external financing conditions,
efforts are being made to shore up defenses. In the event of a significant disruption to local or
international bond markets, contingent financing could become available to Indonesia to support
critical public expenditures under the World Bank’s Program for Economic Resilience, Investment
and Social Assistance in Indonesia Development Policy Loan (DPL) with Deferred Drawdown Option
(approved in May 2012). It provides US$2 billion in contingent budget support through endJune 2014, to be accessed in the event of a fiscal financing crisis, under circumstances set out in a
government decree.2 Additional partner/parallel financing could come from the Asian Development
Bank, Japan, and Australia totaling around US$3 billion (at current exchange rates). A bilateral swap
arrangement (BSA) with Japan (US$12 billion) was extended in August 2013, while BSAs with China
(Y 100 billion) and Korea (US$10 billion) were agreed in October 2013. Under the current Chiang Mai
Initiative Multilateralization (CMIM) agreement, in place since March 2010, Indonesia is able to
access up to US$11.4 billion.3

POLICY ISSUES
11.
Policy discussions focused on restoring stability and reducing vulnerabilities, in light of the
external and fiscal imbalances facing Indonesia and the likely permanent shift in global financing
conditions. Staff noted that while the current policy stance is broadly appropriate, the authorities
should take full advantage of the current delay in UMP tapering to rebuild policy and financial
buffers and improve market perceptions in light of recent volatility. To this end, continued vigilance
over macroeconomic imbalances, clear communication of the policy framework, and firm
follow­through on stabilization measures are needed. Contingent financing and swap arrangements,
which have been put in place, could also provide important fiscal and reserve buffers in the event of
further adverse shocks. In line with recommendations made during the 2012 Article IV consultation,
the authorities have been tightening monetary policy and allowed greater exchange rate flexibility,

Indonesia is already receiving budget support under three DPLs approved by the World Bank’s Executive Board in
November 2012—one on institutional strengthening for social inclusion, one on connectivity, and one on the
financial sector and investment climate reform and modernization.

Under this agreement, Indonesia can swap rupiah for U.S. dollars in the amount of its contribution multiplied by its
current purchasing multiple (2.5), or up to US$11.4 billion. Indonesia has also given formal consent to the doubling of
the CMIM agreement to US$240 billion.

but with some lag.4 Subsidized fuel prices were raised, accompanied by temporary safety nets, but
gaps in the financial stability architecture remain, while trade- and investment-creating
opportunities have not fully materialized.

A. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
12.
Financial conditions remained loose through the first half of 2013. Credit growth
was 20 percent (y/y) in August 2013 (Table 5 and Figure 6), but down from 27 percent in mid­2012.
These conditions were supported by external inflows, abundant liquidity, and low policy rates. With
credit growth outpacing deposit growth, the loan-to-deposit (LDR) ratio reached 89 percent in
August 2013, compared to 84 percent a year earlier. Lately, financial conditions have tightened, with
credit growth expected to slow to 15−20 percent by end­2013 and further in 2014, reflecting
available bank liquidity and higher lending rates. While larger banks are not facing funding
pressures, interbank credit limits to smaller domestic banks have been reduced owing to increasing
concerns about counterparty risks. Moreover, foreign banks’ offshore funding costs have increased
on reduced FX market liquidity, while exchange rate expectations have resulted in wider currency
swap spreads.
13.
Exchange rate and money market developments. From early 2012 to mid-2013, the
rupiah steadily weakened against the U.S. dollar, as Indonesia’s current account balance shifted into
a deficit. However, BI used a combination of heavy intervention and moral suasion to temper large
moves in the exchange rate. These actions tended to drive a wedge between onshore and offshore
(nondeliverable) rates and adversely affected liquidity in the spot FX market (Box 3). When market
pressures intensified in late May 2013, BI’s interventions picked up. Significant reserve losses ensued
in the next two months. Bank Indonesia subsequently reduced interventions in the FX market and
allowed the rupiah to move more freely. In response to selling pressures by foreign investors, BI also
stepped up government bond purchases. Trading in the interbank money market remains thin and
segmented, with negligible activity beyond one-month tenors.
14.
Policy response. Since June 2013, BI’s policy and overnight deposit facility rates have been
raised by 150 bps to 7.25 percent and 5.75 percent, respectively. The overnight lending rate has also
been increased to the same level as the BI policy rate, with the latter now forming the upper bound
of the central bank’s interest corridor. New short-term instruments were introduced in August 2013
to aid bank liquidity management and the holding period on BI bills (SBIs) was shortened to one
month from six months in September 2013 to increase their liquidity and attract more foreign
inflows. To help contain credit growth, BI introduced additional macroprudential measures on
property lending, in the form of lower loan­to­valuation ratios for second and third property loans,

Box 3. Indonesia—Trends in Foreign Exchange Market Development and Functioning
Despite the increasing importance of external flows in the Indonesian
economy, the local foreign exchange (FX) market has remained small
and illiquid relative to Indonesia’s emerging market (EM) peers. Over
the past decade, the growth in the value of FX transactions involving the
rupiah has risen more slowly than most other major EM currencies (Figure 1).
The weaker growth in rupiah transactions is due primarily to relatively tight
restrictions on forward market activity, smaller domestic financial markets,
and the high proportion of commodity exports in the balance of payments.
Regarding this last factor, FX receipts tend to be used to finance capital
imports or are repatriated offshore as profits, and therefore are less likely to
be converted into rupiah.
Data suggest that liquidity in Indonesia’s FX market has fallen in recent
years. Recent evidence of this is the widening in bid­ask spreads to more
than Rp 50 lately compared to an average of Rp 7 in 2010 (Figure 2).
Episodes of onshore market illiquidity (notably in September 2011,
May 2012, and May 2013) were associated with sharp increases in NDF
spreads, as foreign investors were forced to hedge rupiah exposures in
offshore markets. 1/ Intraday volatility, measured by the spread between the
high bid and low ask rates, has also risen markedly, reflecting not only the
rise in global FX volatility, but also the increasingly thin nature of Indonesia’s
FX market. Periods of market illiquidity have also tended to coincide with
more intensive use of moral suasion by Bank Indonesia (BI).
Since August 2013, market functionality has shown signs of improving,
with moral suasion easing up, banks able to quote more freely and transact
in onshore markets, and overall FX market liquidity gradually increasing.
Earlier on, banks’ ability to attract FX from customers (mainly exporters) was
restricted by less favorable conditions. Some FX sales by BI also appeared to
be directed toward fulfilling the large and lumpy FX needs of state-owned
enterprises, including Pertamina (oil and gas) and Perusahann Listrik Negara
(electricity), rather than spreading intervention more broadly throughout the
interbank market. 2/ These two factors reduced the ability of banks to act as
market makers in the interbank market, depressed spot interbank market
activity, and inhibited price discovery. Spot interbank volumes fell from a
daily average of over US$1 billion in 2010 to less than US$300 million in
August 2013 (Figure 3). Since then, interbank FX volumes have picked up
modestly, as BI has communicated clearly its intent to refrain from use of
moral suasion.
A deeper FX market could have a positive impact on foreign investor
sentiment and decrease the risk premia for rupiah­denominated assets.
Given the likely tapering of unconventional monetary policies and increased
uncertainty regarding EM assets, portfolio managers may have to cope with
volatile investment flows for some time. Under these conditions, spreads on
rupiah-denominated assets could rise further to reflect increasing liquidity
premia, unless interbank trading and market making is deepened to improve liquidity.
_____________________________
1/ The sharp increase in the volatility of NDF-onshore spreads since mid-2013 appears partly due to a sharp contraction in NDF trading
resulting from tighter regulation of these markets in Singapore and changes to the fixing methodology.
2/ In the first half of 2013, Pertamina’s main FX outflows comprised the import of oil products (around US$13 billion) and production- and
exploration-related expenses. During the same period, its main inflows came from the export of oil and gas and receipts from global
bonds (totaling approximately US$4 billion)

14

in July 2013. The new measures followed the introduction of tighter regulations on motor vehicle
and residential property lending last year. Phased increases in secondary and LDR-linked reserve
requirements also began coming into effect in September 2013. In addition, BI made it clear that
traders could freely quote exchange rates in the spot market and took other steps to increase
hedging opportunities to deepen market activity. The wedge between onshore and offshore rates
has contracted and spot liquidity has improved moderately, with BI limiting its interventions to
smoothing volatility.
15.
Staff’s position. Bank Indonesia should continue to ensure the monetary policy framework
has a clear nominal anchor that focuses on bringing headline inflation back within the target band
under the central bank’s inflation targeting framework. Policy rate hikes and other liquidity
management measures have been a positive step in this direction, also helping to strengthen market
perceptions. However, monetary transmission remains weak and has substantial lags. Short­term
money market rates are still at the low end of BI’s interest rate corridor. Thus, the effective policy
rate remains negative in real terms. Continued exchange rate flexibility will be necessary to facilitate
BOP adjustment and absorb external shocks, while government bonds should remain market
determined in order to attract external inflows and to meet official financing needs. To consolidate
on recent moves, staff’s main policy recommendations are to:


Further tighten monetary policy if projected inflation remains outside the target band. Building
on earlier actions, some additional tightening measures by BI could reinforce investor
confidence and stabilize capital flows, as well as firm up the monetary anchor. Foreign
exchange swap auctions with resident banks, which started in July 2013, and open market
operations (OMO) should be undertaken consistent with policy tightening.



Ensure BI’s inflation targeting framework is supported by a strengthened monetary
transmission mechanism and deeper money markets. Bank Indonesia’s practice of allowing
money market rates to converge with the deposit facility rate did little to promote market
development. Thus, staff would urge BI to improve the transmission mechanism by
narrowing the interest corridor and using OMO more aggressively to guide short-term rates
back to the middle of the corridor. The introduction of tradable OMO instruments and
ongoing IMF technical assistance (TA) to develop secured lending among banks are
expected to deepen market activity and make the banking system more resilient to liquidity
shocks.



Continue to limit FX market intervention to smoothing volatility. Coupled with clear
communication to traders, these actions should stimulate greater price discovery in the
interbank FX market, increase trading volumes, and reduce perceived liquidity risks. Bank
Indonesia should also continue to scale back FX sales to state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in
order to safeguard reserves. At the same time, the authorities should press ahead with plans
to improve financial risk management practices at all SOEs, in part aimed at prudent
hedging of their FX exposures to mitigate the effects of market volatility, with new
regulations issued in October 2013 expected to aid this effort.

16.
Authorities’ views. The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s assessment of recent
developments and the near-term outlook for financial conditions. They recognized the value of
clearly communicating their policy intentions to anchor market expectations, mitigate inward
spillovers, and ensure orderly adjustment of the exchange rate and bond yields. While BI officials
believed that further monetary policy tightening might be necessary, they indicated that future
decisions would remain data dependent, taking account of both domestic and external conditions.
They also noted that market expectations of UMP tapering in the United States had posed
challenges for their policy response. On inflation targeting, BI officials reaffirmed their commitment
to the framework and indicated that they would continue to take a flexible approach, factoring in
the slowdown in economic activity and the need to strengthen the monetary transmission
mechanism. In this regard, BI viewed staff recommendations as too narrowly focused on policy rates
and noted that indirect instruments would also be used to achieve their monetary targets. The
authorities welcomed planned IMF TA on deepening money and FX markets.

B. Fiscal Policy
17.
Recent developments. The fiscal position has come under increased pressure in recent
years owing to rising energy subsidies and lagging revenue growth. Between 2009 and 2012, energy
subsidies rose by 2 percentage points of GDP due to rapidly expanding fuel consumption and rising
global crude oil prices (Tables 6 and 7 and Figure 7). During the same period, tax revenues grew by
only ¾ percentage points of GDP despite rapid increases in household and corporate income and
healthy consumption growth. Under these circumstances, fiscal space needed for higher
development spending became more constrained. At the same time, public debt levels remained
relatively low, anchored by a fiscal rule limiting the general government deficit to no more than
3 percent of GDP a year.
18.
Budget performance. In the first half of 2013, fiscal performance continued to be affected
by excess subsidy costs and weak revenue growth. In the face of widening fiscal and external
imbalances and possible funding pressures, the government increased subsidized fuel prices by an
average of 33 percent on June 22. At the same time, the fiscal deficit was revised upward to 2.4
percent of GDP in 2013 from an original target of 1.6 percent of GDP (and against a 2012 outturn of
1.9 percent of GDP) to accommodate fiscal slippages in the first half of year. To garner political
support for the fuel price increase, the larger deficit also accommodated temporary cash transfers
and other needed assistance (equivalent to 0.2 percent of GDP) to 15 million households most
vulnerable to fuel price increases.
19.
Staff’s position. Staff noted the need for fiscal policy to support monetary policy in
reducing macroeconomic imbalances in order to ensure a stable macro-environment and help lower
external pressures. Under staff’s current baseline, the deficit is expected to stay around 2½ percent
of GDP in both 2013 and 2014. While this stance is moderately countercyclical, it would put added
pressure on the current account and lead to higher borrowing costs, especially if capital inflows are
not supportive. Thus, staff recommended the following:

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

INDONESIA



Keep the overall deficit capped at 2 percent of GDP in 2013, to bolster credibility and reduce
vulnerability to funding pressures. Staff welcomed the firm action taken by the government
in June to contain fuel subsidies and potentially create space for more productive outlays,
but noted that the rupiah’s depreciation, high world oil prices, and rising natural gas
subsidies were likely to keep the total energy subsidy costs at around 3¾ percent of GDP in
2013—the same level as last year. To contain the deficit, staff urged the authorities to focus
on managing spending and further limit energy subsidy costs, including for natural gas,
noting that weak export-related revenues and higher interest costs were expected to add to
fiscal pressures in the second half of 2013. On their part, the authorities are considering
various means of limiting access to subsidized fuel.



Pursue moderate fiscal consolidation in 2014 and over the medium term, limiting the deficit to
1½ percent of GDP next year to help contain external pressures and funding needs, in line
with the target set forth in the initial draft of the 2014 budget submitted to Parliament in
mid-August 2013. In keeping with this, a final draft of the 2014 budget targeting a deficit of
1.7 percent of GDP was approved by Parliament in late October 2013. However, the target is
based on increases in tax revenues and decreases in fuel subsidy costs that are more
optimistic than those envisaged by staff, mainly due to the government’s macroeconomic
outlook and its lower projected usage of subsidized fuels in 2014.5 Staff noted that to
achieve necessary deficit reduction in 2014, firm policy measures would be needed to
bolster tax collections and reduce energy subsidies, accompanied by appropriate safety
nets.6 Over the near to medium term, space would also be needed for new social protections
coming on stream in 2014 (health care) and 2015 (pensions) and greater infrastructure
investment to support more inclusive growth.



Anchor medium-term consolidation by rationalizing the energy subsidy regime and mobilizing
tax revenues, in order to bring the primary deficit into balance, keep debt levels manageable,
and ensure adequate resources for development spending (Appendix 4). On subsidy reform,
staff urged replacing broad energy subsidies with targeted cash transfers in line with IMF TA
recommendations in this area, building on the current system of transfers already in place.
As a step in this direction, staff welcomed the Ministry of Finance (MoF) proposal to move
from a fixed subsidized price for fuel to a fixed subsidy, which could deliver substantial
savings, urging firm measures be put in place by 2014, also in keeping with G-20 leaders’
commitment to phase out fossil fuel energy subsidies by mid-decade. On revenue growth,
more nonoil tax revenue needs to be mobilized through strong administration, enforcement,
and compliance, reaping the benefit of the rapid rise in registered taxpayers over the past
decade. As noted in last year’s consultation, more could still be done to capture rents and

5

For 2014, the government’s final budget estimates are based on (i) real GDP growth of 6 percent, (ii) an inflation
rate of 5.5 percent (y/y), and (iii) an average exchange rate of Rp 10,500 per U.S. dollar, as well as higher gas and oil
production and lower subsidized fuel consumption than envisaged by staff.
6

To reduce fuel subsidies by 1 percent of GDP in 2014, subsidized fuel prices would need to be raised by an average
of 33 percent or the per liter fuel subsidy would need to restricted to no more than Rp 2,000.

minimize disincentives for investment and production in the resource sector, including oil
and gas, with the aim of increasing predictability of revenue streams and reducing the scope
for corruption. The export tax of 20 percent, imposed on raw minerals in 2013, has likely led
to efficiency losses, given Indonesia’s relative small share of global mining production.
Strengthen cash and debt management, with closer collaboration between the MoF and BI to
manage official liquidity and borrowing costs. Under tighter financing conditions observed
recently, shortening the maturity profile of primary auctions has helped maintain demand, as
investors sought shorter duration. Line ministry accounts in commercial banks should also
be consolidated. More liquid debt could also improve monetary policy effectiveness. Along
these lines, the MoF and BI should agree on modalities for replacing nonmarketable
government securities on the central bank’s balance sheet.7



20.
Authorities’ views. The authorities stated their commitment to maintain a prudent fiscal
stance and secure access to contingency funds in the event financing conditions were to worsen
sharply. Based on recent revisions to their macroeconomic outlook, the government’s deficit target
would be less than 2 percent of GDP in 2014 when the proposed 2014 budget is approved by
Parliament in late 2013. The authorities broadly agreed on the main focus of structural fiscal reforms.
However, in light of the slowdown in growth and political constraints, they expect measured
changes in 2014 to improve tax administration, limit access to subsidized fuel, and optimize
financing from domestic sources through more transparent debt management. The authorities
noted that raising subsidized fuel prices would be politically challenging going into an election year,
but remained committed to a gradual phasing-out of energy subsidies. They recognized the
important buffer provided by contingent budget support, but did not foresee the need to use it
based on their current fiscal outlook.

C. Financial and Corporate Sector Issues
21.
Banking system. The banking system appears sound as a whole, with systemic risk
remaining low, but some divergence exists across institutions, which warrants close watch in light of
rapid credit expansion, recent market turbulence, and incomplete policy buffers. Shadow banking
activity is limited, mainly through finance companies, which control less than 10 percent of financial
system assets. Financial soundness indicators (FSIs) generally improved in 2012 (Table 8) and
compared favorably to major EME and ASEAN peers (Appendix 5). However, some smaller banks are
facing liquidity pressures owing to reduced access to interbank or wholesale funding, narrowness of
their deposit base, and increased funding costs. Sector weaknesses and a slowing economy could
affect asset prices and loan quality. Property prices have accelerated in the past few years (Figure 7),
but the overall risk to the banking system remains limited, with property lending accounting for less
than 15 percent of banks’ total loans. Concerns remain over the composition of banks’ Tier­1 capital
and robustness of loan classification and provisioning standards (as raised in the 2010 FSAP). All

As of August 2013, these securities totaled Rp 234 trillion (2.6 percent of GDP).

three pillars of Basel II have been implemented, although risk-based supervision is still at a nascent
stage. Implementation of Basel III capital standards is slated to begin in 2015, with regulations
governing these standards expected to be issued by end‐2013.
22.
Corporate sector. Debt levels, including external borrowing, have risen sharply in the past
few years, but overall leverage ratios are still relatively low and profitability remains high, with the
main exception being the mining sector (Figure 8). Much of the newly contracted external debt is
either FDI-related or done by large SOEs—the latter with government guarantees (Box 4). Some
corporate borrowing appears to have unhedged FX exposure. Other potential risks mainly stem from
a sustained fall in commodity prices or a sharp rise in oil prices.
23.
Financial sector oversight. The transfer of banking supervision from BI to Otoritas Jasa
Keuangan (OJK), the financial services agency, is on schedule to be completed by the beginning
of 2014. The two institutions are formalizing agreements on organizational and human resource
issues, data collection and information sharing, and bank regulation, licensing, and supervision. As
part of its mandate, OJK continues to develop a new framework for the consolidated supervision of
financial conglomerates, which it expects to introduce in 2014 (regulation and oversight of capital
markets and the insurance sector came under OJK’s purview in 2012). Bank Indonesia and OJK are
also finalizing a memorandum of understanding (MOU) on macro- and microprudential surveillance
and policy to ensure a clear delineation of authority and proper channels of communication.
24.
Crisis management framework. Currently, the Financial System Stability Forum (FKSSK)
plays the central role in guiding crisis management responses. The FKSSK, established by the OJK
law, is operating in accordance with protocols embodied in MoUs signed in 2012, which stipulate
the basis for coordination by the MoF, BI, OJK and Lembaga Penjamin Simpanan (LPS), the deposit
insurance agency. However, crisis management protocols (CMPs), particularly those governing
emergency liquidity provisions and interventions in systemically important financial institutions
(SIFIs), are lacking. A draft Financial System Safety Net (FSSN) law has been submitted to Parliament
addressing these gaps, but its passage is not expected before the 2014 elections.
25.
Financial deepening. By deepening financial markets and offering a greater range of
products, more domestic savings could be mobilized and capital flows could be better absorbed.
Resource allocation as a whole would be expected to improve to support growth, including to fund
infrastructure development and other long-term commitments. Bank Indonesia, with IMF TA
support, has embarked on a comprehensive strategy for financial market development (Box 5). An
immediate priority is to facilitate the development of money markets. This could provide better
benchmarks for long-term financing and promote market-making activities. Another key goal is to
expand the supply of long-term savings through the growth of the pension and mutual funds
industry, which is expected to be guided by the design of the expanded social insurance schemes.

Box 4. Indonesia—Corporate External Financing
Total corporate external debt has risen rapidly in the past five years, but most of this was FDI­related
or by state-owned enterprises (SOEs). Total corporate external debt rose to US$104 billion at
end­July 2013 (latest available data) from US$53 billion at end-2008. However, about 30 percent of this
increase was FDI­related, i.e., financed by parent or affiliated companies. The increase in FDI­related debt
was concentrated in the mining, transportation and communications, and manufacturing sectors, broadly in
line with the pattern of total FDI inflows. Another one-third of the increase was incurred by SOEs, mostly
Pertamina (oil and natural gas) and Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN) (electricity). Private sector non­FDI
related debt accounted for the rest of the increase.

Factors explaining the rise in corporate external debt suggest its recent rapid growth poses limited
risks going forward. While disbursements of new FDI­related debt should slow in line with the expected
slowdown in overall FDI inflows, existing FDI­related debt would likely be rolled over by parent and
affiliated companies. The rise in SOE external borrowing is more a matter of public debt sustainability, as
both Pertamina and PLN benefit from sovereign guarantees. PLN also receives foreign currency loans from
the government, on­lent from official project financing.
While most of the increase in corporate external debt is related to sectors with foreign currency cash
flows, some companies are likely exposed to rupiah depreciation. Mining companies could also face
additional pressure if commodity prices were to fall further. Excluding FDI­related external debt, the
resource and utilities sectors accounted for 63 percent of total corporate nonfinancial external debt, while
some of the remainder has been used to finance tourism­related and manufactured export activities.
Given its relatively short maturity structure, the rollover of corporate external debt could prove
challenging if financial conditions were to deteriorate sharply. Most of the principal payments due by
end­2014 on this type of debt are related to trade credits and revolving loans. However, the bulk of these
loans is likely FDI­related, given that FDI­related debt accounted for about 64 percent of gross external
debt disbursed to nonfinancial corporates for the year ending July 2013. While this should reduce problems
with short­term debt rollover, the recent increase in external yields will quickly be reflected in higher
interest costs for corporate borrowers.

Box 5. Indonesia—Financial Market Deepening
Financial markets in Indonesia are generally less developed than emerging market peers. As of end-2012, stock market
capitalization was equivalent to 49 percent of GDP, with free floating stocks accounting for only 37 percent of the total.
Outstanding debt securities issued domestically amounted to 15 percent of GDP, with government securities accounting for
85 percent of the total. Furthermore, the money market is relatively thin and volatile, with trading primarily comprising
outright transactions at short horizons up to one month. Similarly, spot transactions dominate trading in the foreign
exchange market, with limited use of derivatives such as swaps and options. Daily foreign exchange turnovers only amounted
to 0.6 percent of GDP in April 2013, compared to an average of 2.4 percent of GDP among peers.

Deepening financial markets in Indonesia is vital for mobilizing savings to fund investment and providing a wider range of
financial products to meet the social needs. In addition, more liquid money and foreign exchange markets would enable the
economy to better withstand shocks and enhance policy transmission mechanisms. Similarly, more diversified and deeper
capital markets would help intermediate capital inflows without large swings in asset prices, therefore supporting financial
stability. The availability of derivative instruments would also allow businesses and households to manage their financial risks
more effectively. Finally, a broader and more diversified domestic investor base would bolster the resilience of Indonesia’s
financial markets, currently dominated by foreign investors, to global financial shocks, which could cause market turmoil as
witnessed in recent months.
Indonesia is taking steps to address this issue, with staff recommending an action plan be implemented over the next three
years comprising three modules, which individually would address deficiencies in money, foreign exchange, and capital
markets. Key actions to be taken are envisaged as follows:
Money Market




Increase availability and liquidity of short-tenor treasury bills; promote lending at longer horizons; and expand types of
instruments traded, with the development of the Global Master Repurchase Agreement a key.
Revise Bank Indonesia (BI)’s monetary operations to improve incentives for money market participation, including
reducing the frequency of open market operations and destigmatizing the use of BI’s lending facility.
Strengthen institutional arrangements, including establishing a self-regulatory body and a code of conduct for market
participants.

Foreign Exchange Market




Reduce BI’s presence in the foreign exchange market, including relying more on market-based interventions, and
decreasing existing market segmentation arising from BI’s greater interactions with public banks (see Box 3).
Employ more flexible reserve requirements to deal with volatility in the foreign exchange market.
Review the regulations on derivatives trading to allow for rollover and netting of derivatives; facilitate the development
of new instruments; and enhance the monitoring system to better disseminate market information.

Capital Markets



Ease regulatory frictions, such as restrictions on foreign exchange forward contracts and on pension funds’ collateralized
borrowing, which have unintended negative consequences on capital market development.
Develop a broader and more diversified domestic investor base by promoting financial inclusion, strengthening the
governance and institutional framework, and facilitating the mobilization of funds from contractual savings to finance
investment, especially in infrastructure.

26.
Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT). In February
2013, a new CFT law was enacted that focused on the criminalization of terrorist financing. However,
Indonesia is still included on the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) list of jurisdictions that have
not made sufficient progress in addressing strategic shortcomings in their AML/CFT framework, as
the law does not fully address identified deficiencies, particularly with regard to the framework for
identifying and freezing terrorist assets. These concerns should be addressed as quickly as possible
in order to protect Indonesia’s financial sector from heightened scrutiny from foreign financial
institutions, avoid possible countermeasures, and facilitate an exit from the FATF monitoring
process.
27.
Staff’s position. The banking and corporate sectors are likely to face a more challenging
environment than in the recent past, stemming from a slowing economy, rupiah depreciation, and
tightening financial conditions. To strengthen buffers, macroprudential oversight and crisis
management arrangements need to be augmented, building on BI’s systemic risk framework put in
place in recent years. Further progress is also needed on addressing FSAP recommendations, while
plans should be in train for completing an FSAP update by 2015. To buttress stability, the main
policy recommendations are to:


Closely monitor banks’ and corporates’ financial soundness and risk management practices,
while continuing to manage carefully the transfer of banking supervision to OJK, with a focus
on ensuring the continuity of supervisory activities. Current macroprudential measures
appear adequate, but banks with large restructured loans or heavy exposure to exportrelated and property sectors need heightened monitoring. In view of tighter financial
conditions and the rupiah’s depreciation, corporate leverage ratios and external borrowing
should also be systematically monitored.



Fill gaps in existing CMPs, in the absence of passage of the FSSN law, and revise the BI, OJK,
LPS, and banking laws to ensure legal consistency. Staff argued that interim protocols (likely
by presidential decree) governing the provision of emergency liquidity assistance and
interventions in SIFIs should be an immediate priority. While current liquidity pressures
reside mainly in smaller banks, clear CMPs coupled with early corrective actions could avoid
an amplification of risks. The FKSSK secretariat should focus on serving as a coordinating
body by integrating each member’s CMPs into a mutually supportive framework, but refrain
from developing its own surveillance capacity.



Establish a well-functioning macroprudential framework. Going forward, BI should take a lead
role in systemic risk monitoring and assessment in conducting macroprudential policy and
also within the FKSSK, while OJK should drive the implementation of all prudential tools. A
clear accountability framework for making policy decisions and exercising these
responsibilities needs to be put in place.

Authorities’ views. The authorities were in general agreement with staff’s assessments and
recommendations. Bank Indonesia noted that banks continue to manage potential risks well. The
authorities indicated their desire to see passage of the FSSN law and readiness to amend related

financial sector legislation to ensure a comprehensive and coordinated approach to crisis
management.

D. Medium-Term Policy Priorities
29.
Overview. It has long been recognized that deep-seated reforms are needed to reduce
supply bottlenecks in order to broaden the export base, bolster employment growth, and improve
medium-term growth prospects, with a view to reducing poverty and inequality in Indonesia. The
need for reform has been given added momentum by the weak outlook for commodity prices and
the need to diversify the economy away from the primary resources. While major actions may be
more difficult ahead of the elections in mid­2014, interim measures could improve the supply
response and bolster investor sentiment toward Indonesia.
30.
Priorities. The authorities have taken some steps recently to liberalize the investment
regime, but a less piecemeal approach is needed to bolster competitiveness. Further efforts are
needed to improve the business climate, focused on rationalizing the trade and investment regime
and boosting labor productivity, as well as improving financial sector access and efficiency.


Trade and investment. The main priority is to improve the transparency, predictability, and
stability of the trade and investment regime and reorient it toward promoting competition
and competitiveness. The imposition of quotas on beef and horticultural imports earlier
in 2013 led to severe market disruptions and food price hikes, with staff welcoming a move
to put in place less restrictive measures aimed at improving supply conditions. The
scheduled ban on raw (unprocessed) mineral ore exports in 2014 has also raised uncertainty,
with a clear transition plan needed to avoid adding pressures on the current account and to
bolster investor confidence in developing onshore mineral processing facilities. More
generally speaking, a less restrictive and more investor-friendly negative list for foreign
investment, coupled with improvements in transportation, power supply, and logistics, could
bolster regional integration and strengthen growth prospects.



Labor markets. Removing impediments to employment generation in the formal sector is
critical to raising productivity and output growth and providing opportunities for low­wage
workers (Box 6 and Appendix 6). Indonesia’s labor market remains dominated by the
informal sector. Currently, only one-third of the labor force has formal sector employment
(defined as employees plus the self-employed assisted by permanent workers); the rest of
the labor force comprises the informal sector, which is concentrated generally in low-paying
work in the agricultural and services sectors. Less than 40 percent of formal and informal
sector workers in Indonesia have full-time employment (i.e., work more than 35 hours per
week), with this level of underemployment and concentration in informal sectors higher than
most of its EME peers. Reducing the rigidity of Indonesia’s labor regulations, particularly with
respect to severance pay, would improve Indonesia’s competitiveness and generate jobs to
absorb a large pool of underemployed workers (notably in the agricultural sector),
supported by higher social spending. Aligning wage increases with productivity growth and
redefining the minimum wage as a safety net instrument rather than a tool for collective
bargaining would help on this front as well.

Box 6. Indonesia—Structural Transformation and Labor Market Issues
Structural transformation of Indonesia’s economy and its labor force has been slow in recent years. In particular, agriculture
employment remains exceptionally high, while the productivity differential between the agricultural and manufacturing
sectors has been widening. So why has a large share of labor remained in the relatively low-productivity agricultural sector
With near to medium-term growth prospects clouded by uncertain external factors and softer commodity prices, reallocating
labor to higher productivity areas may be a key to sustaining growth and avoiding a middle-income trap, but rigid labor
market regulations are one factor hindering this transformation.
Despite its low productivity relative to other sectors, the agricultural sector continues to employ over one-third of
the labor force in Indonesia. Although the employment share in agriculture has declined by 20 percentage points over
the last two decades, most of this labor has been absorbed by the services sector instead of the more productive
manufacturing sector. In fact, the manufacturing sector’s share of the economy has declined significantly over the past
decade, contributing to only 24 percent of GDP in 2011 and providing less than 15 percent of the workforce—both
among the lowest contributors to output and employment in the region.
This factor highlights Indonesia’s inefficient allocation of labor across sectors, which puts it at risk of being
ensnared in a middle­income trap. Among 46 emerging and developing countries for which data in 2007 are available
in the World Development Indicators database, Indonesia stands out with one of the highest employment shares in
agriculture (7th), but also with one of the lowest levels of agricultural productivity relative to manufacturing productivity
(6th). A hypothetical labor reallocation from the current shares to the average of sample countries (24 percent in
agriculture, 23 percent in manufacturing, and 53 percent in services), keeping the labor productivity in each sector
unchanged, would raise Indonesia’s aggregate labor productivity and income per capita by as much as 13 percent.1/
Rigid labor market regulations have undermined the manufacturing sector’s capacity to transform output growth
into employment opportunities, especially for large and exporting firms. The growth in labor costs in manufacturing
has outpaced productivity gains, leading to rising unit labor costs and a move away from labor-intensive manufacturing
sectors. Factors behind the increase in unit labor costs have been high minimum wage levels relative to average wages,
frequent adjustments to minimum wages themselves, and indexation of most wage contracts to minimum wage increases.
Strict labor regulations governing severance payments, limits on the use of fixed-term contracts, and outsourcing
restrictions have also significantly added to labor costs, especially in the manufacturing sector, where they tend to be the
most binding.
Reducing these rigidities, as well as aligning minimum wage increases with productivity growth, would help
improve competitiveness in Indonesia’s manufacturing sector, and provide greater opportunities to low-wage,
informal sector workers. These actions would in turn help generate the jobs needed to absorb a larger pool of labor in
the agriculture sector, raise per capita income, and potentially position Indonesia to expand its export base. With women
more likely to be informal workers and the majority of informal workers poor,2 structural transformations accompanying
formal employment creation should help promote gender equality and enhance macro-social stability.

STAFF APPRAISAL
31.
Indonesia faces a more challenging macroeconomic environment, stemming initially
from slowing growth in major EMEs and falling commodity prices, and more recently, from capital
outflows and tighter funding conditions tied to a prospective exit from extraordinarily easy global
monetary conditions. This reversal in tailwinds, coupled with an accommodative policy stance, has
put pressure on Indonesia’s BOP. Recent market volatility and reserve losses highlight the need in
Indonesia for upfront policy tightening to ease external and fiscal pressures and firm actions over
the medium term to reduce supply bottlenecks.
32.
Downside risks have become more pronounced over the past year. Indonesia is
vulnerable to protracted volatility in EMEs, exacerbated by a disorderly unwinding of UMPs in
advanced economies and/or a more pronounced growth slowdown among major trade partners,
including China and India, in combination with a further softening in commodity prices. A
deterioration in investor sentiment, prompted by external conditions and policy uncertainty in
Indonesia, could intensify macroeconomic pressures and feed back into confidence. At the same
time, EBA’s REER estimates show the exchange rate to be broadly in line with fundamentals, while
debt levels remain relatively low and resilient to standard shocks.
33.
The near-term outlook reflects emerging challenges. Growth is projected to slow in 2013
and 2014 on weaker investment and external demand. Inflation will likely peak by end­2013 before
moderating, with second-round effects of earlier fuel price increases and exchange rate
pass­through driving near-term momentum. The current account deficit is expected to widen further
in 2013 and narrow only slightly in 2014, despite recent exchange rate adjustment, with the outlook
reflecting soft export demand and commodity prices and a continued rise in net oil and gas imports.
The projected slowdown in FDI and volatility of portfolio flows will make Indonesia more vulnerable
to external shocks in the near term. Reserve losses, which have been sizable in the past year, are
expected to slow going forward, with capital inflows foreseen to pick up gradually and the flexible
exchange rate facilitating adjustment of the current account.
34.
Recent policy measures show signs of easing pressures and reducing vulnerabilities.
The authorities have taken significant steps in recent months to contain external and fiscal
imbalances, reduce inflation pressures, and manage market volatility. Staff welcome moves to roll
back energy subsidies, tighten monetary policy, and allow exchange rates and bond yields to adjust,
as well as measures aimed at improving business sentiment. Clear coordination and communication
of the policy framework will improve its overall effectiveness. Contingent financing arrangements
put in place should help cushion the impact of any new shocks or prolonged market disruptions.
35.
Nonetheless, the current environment warrants continued vigilance, in order to
consolidate recent stabilization efforts. The current delay in the tapering of UMPs should be seen
as an opportunity to strengthen policy and financial buffers and improve market perceptions.
Foremost, the current account deficit needs to be reduced to a sustainable level and inflation placed
firmly within the target band. Further policy rate hikes by BI may be necessary if BOP or inflation

pressures do not subside. Fiscal policy should support monetary policy in order to contain external
pressures, while needing to provide adequate space for new social protections and higher capital
spending. In keeping with this, fiscal consolidation, targeted at bringing the primary deficit back into
balance, will require bolstering tax collections and eliminating energy subsidies over the medium
term, supported by efforts aimed at better prioritizing expenditures. To manage volatility and
encourage capital inflows, the exchange and interest rates should remain flexible, which will also
assist in boosting reserve buffers.
36.
Maintaining a stable financial system requires that Indonesia have in place a
framework and contingencies for managing systemic risks. With bank supervision in transition
between regulators, special attention will be needed to avoid oversight gaps. Responsibilities for
macro­ and microprudential surveillance should be clearly delineated, supported by actions to
strengthen the financial stability architecture. Banks’ asset quality and capital positions are generally
sound, but financial indicators bear close watch given rapid credit expansion in recent years, the rise
in LDRs, and the recent slowdown in economic activity. Further efforts should be made to
strengthen the AML/CFT regime in line with the FATF’s recommendations.
37.
Broader reforms are needed to raise productivity, create new export opportunities,
and support higher, more inclusive growth. The government should focus on accelerating
infrastructure investment, addressing labor market rigidities, deepening financial markets, and
creating a more open trade and investment regime. The government announced several measures
in mid­2013 aimed at addressing these shortcomings, but more comprehensive and cohesive
actions are needed to bolster investor confidence and achieve potential growth.
38.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard
12­month cycle.

Figure 2. Indonesia: Recent Market Developments
Financial markets have partially recovered from the post May
22 sell off, aided by policy tightening in Indonesia and a
delay in the tapering of unconventional monetary policies…

…with bond inflows from foreign investors leading the reversal
over the past few months.

Reflecting this, domestic bonds yields have fallen lately, but
still remain well above pre May 22 levels.

Equity prices, which fell by more than 25 percent in the mid
2013 sell off, have recovered about half of the loss incurred
between May and August 2013.

The rupiah began to weaken significantly vis à vis the U.S.
dollar in mid 2013, as foreign exchange market intervention
by Bank Indonesia (BI) eased up.

After widening sharply between May and August, external
spreads have narrowed recently in line with other emerging
markets (EMs).

Figure 3. Emerging Markets: Recent Developments
Comparing recent market performance in Indonesia to peer
group EMs, the rupiah has depreciated more than most other
currencies vis à vis the U.S. dollar.

Bond yields in Indonesia have also increased more than in
other EMs...

…while sovereign CDS spreads have widened significantly
more than most peers.

Equity prices have held up better in Indonesia relative to peers
in 2013, but mainly due to large increases in the first half of
the year.

Despite the rupiah’s pronounced depreciation, foreign reserves
have fallen more in Indonesia than among other EMs…

…which along with higher inflation has prompted BI to tighten
monetary policy more aggressively.

Figure 4. Indonesia: Real Sector Developments
Growth slowed in 2013:H1, with investment the main factor.
While net exports continued to make a positive contribution,
this partly reflects weak investment related import demand.

Production indicators point to further slowing…

…with moderating investment demand showing in tepid
growth in cement sales.

Consumption growth is also slowing, evidenced by a
significant weakening in retail sales.

Headline inflation accelerated in 2013 on the impact of
June’s fuel price increase and a food price spike at midyear…

…although subsidized fuel prices in Indonesia remain low
compared to the market based price.

Figure 5. Indonesia: External Sector Developments
The current account balance shifted into a deficit at
end­2011 due to deterioration in both the oil and non­oil
trade balances, with reserves also coming under pressure.

Exports have slowed more sharply than imports…

…reflecting weaker commodity prices...

…with key commodity export prices unlikely to pick up going
into 2014.

Still, export volumes have shown some signs of recovery…

…while import growth remains depressed due mainly to raw
materials and capital goods.

Figure 6. Indonesia: Monetary and Interest Rate Developments
Monetary policy has been tightened, with the BI rate and
deposit facility rate increased by 150 bps since June 2013.

However, overnight money market rates are still close to the
bottom of the interest rate corridor, as liquidity conditions
have yet to firm significantly…

…with real short term rates remaining low by most
measures…

...and broad money and credit growth only moderating slowly.

Funding pressures may be rising as loan to deposit ratios
continue to increase…

…but this is only beginning to be reflected in retail lending and
deposit rates, suggesting lags in the monetary transmission
mechanism.

Figure 7. Indonesia: Fiscal Developments
The fiscal deficit has widened since 2010, driven mainly by
rising energy subsidies.

Despite this, the public debt to GDP ratio remains low.

Tax revenue as a share of GDP has stagnated given limited
progress on non resource revenue mobilization…

…with Indonesia having the lowest tax to GDP ratio among its
regional peers.

Notwithstanding the June 2013 increase in subsidized fuel
prices, energy subsidies are expected to remain large in
2013…

…with the fiscal deficit increasing at a faster pace than in
recent years.

in foreign currency debt issues.

Equity valuations have come down lately with the mid 2013

Recommended Policy
Responses

Global/short to
medium term
Protracted economic
and financial
volatility, especially
in emerging market
economies (EMEs)
(triggered by
prospective exit from
UMP)

High: Prospects of higher interest
rates in advanced economies could
trigger a sustained reversal of capital
flows.

High: Portfolio and FDI inflows could be
curtailed by weaker investor appetite,
brought on by a further re weighting of
EM assets, with tighter funding conditions
adding to pressure on the balance of
payments (BOP), on government finances,
and in the financial sector.

Allow exchange rate flexibility to facilitate
BOP adjustment; and tighten monetary
policy to help reduce the trade deficit and
boost investor confidence. Pursue fiscal
consolidation possibly through tax and
subsidy reforms; with government also
using contingent financing if market access
is restricted. Accelerate structural reforms
to boost productivity and employment in
nonresource sectors.

Global/short term
Financial stress in
the euro area
reemerges

Medium: Bank sovereign real
economy links could intensify on a
stalled or incomplete delivery of policy
commitments at the national or euro
area level or adverse developments in
the periphery.

Medium: Direct trade and financial impact
is limited. However, portfolio net inflows
could weaken on rising global risk
aversion. Weaker global growth would
reduce exports and FDI, leading to BOP
pressures and reserve losses.

Exchange rate flexibility and monetary
policy tightening, as discussed above.

Global/short term
Fiscal policy shock in
the United States

Low

Medium/High: A sharp increase in global
risk aversion associated with a large
negative shock could spur capital outflows,
drive up local yields, and put downward
pressure on the rupiah. The global outlook
would also weaken, driving down
commodity prices and resulting in BOP
pressures.

Exchange rate flexibility and monetary
policy tightening, as discussed above

Global/short term
Global oil shock
triggered by
geopolitical events
(driving oil prices to
US$150 per barrel)

Low

High: Both fiscal and current account
balances would deteriorate immediately. A
second round impact could come through
weaker global growth and market
sentiment.

Increase subsidized fuel prices to help
reduce imbalances, with temporary fiscal
support to protect those more vulnerable.
Allow exchange rate flexibility to absorb
pressure and tighten monetary policy to
limit second­round effects on inflation.

Global/ medium term
Lower than
anticipated
emerging market
growth potential

Medium: A deeper than expected
slowdown in EMEs due to earlier
maturing of the cycle and incomplete
structural reforms with spillovers to
low income and advanced economies.

High: Lower demand or prices for
commodity exports could widen the
current account deficit, adding to BOP
pressures and resulting in reserve losses.
The fiscal balance would deteriorate on
weaker resource revenues and knock on
effects to domestic demand, while the
financial sector could be exposed to this
broader slowdown.

Exchange rate flexibility and monetary
policy tightening, as discussed above.
Fiscal measures to contain the budget
deficit might be necessary if slowdown in
EMEs was accompanied by protracted
financial market volatility.

Global/medium term
Sharp slowdown in
growth in China
(buildup of excess
capacity eventually
resulting in large
financial and fiscal
losses)

Medium: China is one of Indonesia’s
largest export markets and sources of
FDI, having a major impact on prices
of Indonesia’s commodity exports and
demand conditions for some of its
major trade partners.

Medium/High: Lower demand or prices
for commodity exports could lead to
deterioration in the current account. FDI
inflows into Indonesia’s resource sector
could be curtailed, resulting in increased
external vulnerability and possible reserve
losses. The fiscal balance would
deteriorate.

Exchange rate flexibility and some fiscal
consolidation, along with accelerated
structural reforms to boost productivity
and employment in nonresource sectors.

Domestic/short term
Government funding
shortfalls

Medium: Domestic funding
requirements remain large into 2014
and could become problematic if
EMEs remain volatile and/or liquidity
pressures on domestic banks intensify.

Medium/High: Limited scope to meet
financing shortfall from government
deposits. Market confidence could
deteriorate rapidly if the policy response is
inadequate and domestic yields could
spike.

Tighten fiscal policy, while maintaining
exchange rate and bond yield flexibility to
avoid a market disruption, with
government also using external contingent
financing if market access is restricted.

Domestic/short to
medium term
Prolonged inaction
on key structural
reforms undermines
business confidence

Medium: Steps in the past few years
to restrict foreign mining operations,
impose a raw mineral ores ban, and
curtail beef and horticultural imports
have raised concerns.

Medium: Negative investor sentiment
toward Indonesia could add to undermine
competitiveness, impede FDI, and
exacerbate BOP pressures, with welfare
losses.

Reverse trend toward ad hoc trade and
investment restrictions; take firm measures
to reduce structural bottlenecks, notably
on infrastructure development and labor
market flexibility, and improve governance.

Domestic/short to
medium term
Banking system
distress by a severe
funding squeeze

Low/Medium: Stress could arise from
liquidity pressures prompted by
sizable capital outflows and/or a sharp
economic slowdown. Uncertainty
regarding the crisis management
framework could complicate the policy
response and amplify risks.

Medium: Severe financial stresses on
banks that have higher loan to deposit
ratios and lower capital buffers, with a
sharp rise in deposit and lending rates,
deterioration in asset quality, and reduced
profitability.

Ensure proper risk controls at banks, with
clear lender of last resort/emergency
liquidity protocols in place and close
coordination between financial regulators,
backed by swift approval by Parliament of
the Financial Safety Net Law or stop gap
measures.

1/ The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view
of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to
indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 percent and 30 percent, and “high” a probability of 30 percent or
more). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities.

Appendix 2. Indonesia—External Vulnerabilities in Perspective1
Overview
1.
This appendix looks at developments in Indonesia’s external position and
benchmarks its vulnerability indicators over time and across countries. The main findings
are: (i) the deterioration in the current account from 2011 to 2012 was caused primarily by rising
imports, due to strong GDP and investment growth, and falling commodity prices; (ii) Indonesia’s
current account position in 2012 was worse than at the onset of the global financial crisis, but
most other indicators were as good or better than in 2007; and (iii) looking across countries,
Indonesia’s indicators in 2012−13 are in the middle of its peers and generally better than
standard thresholds. Going forward, the recent REER depreciation coupled with higher interest
rates should slow import growth and help improve Indonesia’s external position over the
medium term. This adjustment should be supported by appropriate macroeconomic policies.
What Caused the Current Account Deficit to Widen in 2012?
2.
Indonesia’s current account balance deteriorated by 3 percentage points of GDP
in 2012. In the process, it went from a surplus of 0.2 percent of GDP in 2011 to a deficit of
2.8 percent of GDP in 2012—the largest swing in the current account balance in more than a
decade. This change was even larger than the 1½ percentage points of GDP reduction in the
current account surplus from 2007 to 2008 and followed 14 consecutive years of surpluses.
3.
The data show that the deterioration in 2012 was due entirely to the trade balance,
spread evenly across exports and imports, concentrated in the non­oil and gas trade
(Table 2.1). Examining the distribution across exports and imports, about US$12 billion of the
US$26 billion deterioration in the trade balance was due to a decline in exports and US$14 billion
due to a rise in imports. Exports were especially affected by a decline in commodity prices for
rubber, coal, and palm oil and a fall in the export volumes of oil and gas. The latter occurred
owing to a slowdown and diversion in production from exports toward domestic uses. Imports
rose primarily due to increased demand for raw materials (up US$7.2 billion) used in domestic
manufacturing and for capital goods (up US$4.4 billion), including those imports associated with
foreign direct investment (FDI) (up 17 percent).
How Do Current Indicators Compare to 2008−09?
4.
A comparison of vulnerability indicators in (i) the run up to the global financial
crisis and (ii) recent period of market turbulence suggests that vulnerabilities are lower
with the exception of a large shift in the current account balance.
On the domestic front, real, fiscal, and financial indicators were broadly stronger
in 2012 compared to 2007. Growth was more than 6 percent in both 2007 and 2012,
but inflation was considerably lower in 2012 (Figure 2.1). On the fiscal side, the central
government’s budget deficit was less than 2 percent in both years, while public sector
debt fell by almost a third from 35 percent to 24 percent of GDP between 2007 and 2012.

In the financial sector, capital adequacy ratios were well above the statutory minimum in
both years, while nonperforming loans fell from 4 percent to 2 percent of total loans
from 2007 to 2012 (Figure 2.2).


As for the external sector, the current account balance deteriorated sharply
between 2007 and 2012, but other indicators improved (Figures 2.3 and 2.4). The
current account balance worsened by 4½ percent of GDP, from a surplus of 1½ percent
of GDP in 2007 to a deficit of 2¾ percent of GDP in 2012. The change was largely due to
a fall in commodity prices, lower production and higher consumption of oil and gas, and
increased imports arising from strong growth and investment. At the same time, the
external financing requirement (forward current account deficit plus debt falling due
within a year) increased from 4¾ to 9 percent of GDP, with the change due entirely to
the current account deterioration. On the positive side, FDI increased as a share of GDP
and of total external financing. Moreover, total external debt fell from 33 to 29 percent of
GDP between end 2007 and end 2012, while short­term debt remained at only 6 percent
of GDP. Looking at reserves, reserve coverage of both the IMF metric and debt due
within a year remained stable and well above the recommended ratios of 100 percent.
Reserve coverage as a share of imports increased from 4¾ to 6½ months from 2007
to 2012—also well above standard rules of thumb.

Size and Type of Shocks
5.
In both 2008 and 2013, shocks originated primarily from abroad rather than home.
In 2008−09, the subprime crisis in the United States caused uncertainty in global financial
markets and concern about the stability of financial systems. Growth in advanced economies
slowed, affecting trade and financial flows to emerging market economies (EMEs). In 2013, the
anticipated unwinding of accommodative monetary policies in advanced economies (i.e., a
tapering of extraordinary bond purchases by the U.S. Federal Reserve) led investors to expect
higher global interest rates, rebalance portfolios, and withdraw capital from EMEs, especially
those perceived to have weaker fundamentals.
6.
In terms of magnitude, the global shock in 2008−09 was much larger than the
shock in 2012−13. Global growth and trade dropped precipitously at the outset of the crisis,
whereas the projected change for 2012−14 is currently minimal. At the same time, net private
capital flows to EMEs are projected to increase in 2012 and 2013 compared to a decline in 2008
and 2009. On the other hand, a key difference is that global interest rates fell in 2008 and 2009,
while they are expected to rise going into 2014 (Figure 2.5).
7.
In terms of the impact on Indonesia, trade growth and commodity prices dropped
more significantly in 2008−09 (Figure 2.6). However, Indonesia also showed significantly larger
import compression in 2008−09. The decline in 2009 in non­oil and gas imports was particularly
sharp, arising from a 30 percent decline in imports of raw materials and capital goods, whereas
in 2013 these two categories of imports are only expected to decline by about 5 percent because
of still relatively supportive conditions. As a result, the current account balance is expected to
deteriorate more from 2012 to 2013 rather than improve as it did from 2008 to 2009.

How Do Indonesia’s Indicators Compare to Other Large Emerging Markets?
8.
Notwithstanding the smaller shock compared with 2008−09, Indonesia has been
significantly affected by volatility of financial markets in 2013. Given the large impact, how
do Indonesia’s vulnerability indicators compare with other EMEs?


Indonesia’s current account deficit, external financing requirements, and debt indicators
are in the middle of its peer group (Figures 2.7 and 2.8).



Bank soundness indicators are relatively strong (Figure 2.9; see also Appendix 5).



Reserve adequacy metrics for Indonesia at end­2012 were also in line with peers,
although recent pressures have significantly reduced reserve coverage (Figure 2.10).



While remaining stable, Indonesia also has a lower credit rating than most of its peer
group, pointing to the need to buttress policy buffers, strengthen institution capacity,
and ensure sound debt management to cushion against potential future shocks.

Appendix 3. Indonesia—Debt Sustainability1
External Debt Sustainability
1.
Indonesia’s external debt to GDP ratio was 28¾ percent of GDP at end­2012
(Table 3.1). It is projected to rise moderately to 32¼ percent of GDP in 2014 before falling
gradually to 31¼ percent by 2018. Previously, Indonesia’s external debt peaked at 32 percent of
GDP in 2009, before falling back to 26½ percent of GDP at end 2011. Current account surpluses,
robust foreign direct investment (FDI), and nominal exchange rate appreciation were the main
factors in the improvement in the debt to GDP ratio during this period. Conversely, a
deterioration in the current account balance in 2012 and exchange rate depreciation caused the
reversal in 2012.
2.
Under the baseline, FDI and new borrowing offset current account deficits
(excluding interest payments), which average about 3 percent of GDP during 2013−18.
(This is also the debt stabilizing level). Current account deficits are expected to be above
3 percent of GDP in 2013 and 2014 before falling below it in 2015−18. The baseline depends on
improvements in the external outlook, moderate fiscal consolidation, and a reinvigoration of
trade and investment reforms. Real growth is projected to be around 6 percent in the medium
term. The external debt to GDP ratio is expected to be higher than that projected in the
2012 Article IV consultation staff report due to a more depreciated exchange rate and slower real
growth (Figure 3.1).
3.
External sustainability is robust to most shocks. Aside from a depreciation shock, the
external debt ratio remains at or below 36 percent of GDP under all standardized shocks (Figure
3.2). A one˗time, 30 percent real exchange rate depreciation would raise the external debt ratio
by about 11 percentage points above the baseline path to 42 percent of GDP in 2018.
Public Debt Sustainability
4.
Public sector debt has been declining as a share of GDP since 2000 despite the
global shock in 2009.2 It fell to a record­low level of 24.4 percent at end­2011 and remained
broadly unchanged in 2012, owing to prudent fiscal management and low fiscal deficits in the
last decade (Table 3.2). Lower interest rates and relatively high growth also contributed to debt
consolidation. Foreign currency denominated debt has fallen to less than half of total public
sector debt, as the improved fiscal position facilitated greater government access to the
domestic capital market.

Public sector debt does not include debt of state-owned enterprises. Total gross debt of nonfinancial public
sector corporations was Rp 262 trillion (3.2 percent of GDP) as of June 2012.

50

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

INDONESIA

Under the baseline scenario, public sector debt is expected to rise to around 26.8 percent
of GDP in 2014 due to larger fiscal deficits and financing needs. Over the medium term,
public debt is expected to decline as a share of GDP—to around 24.4 percent by 2018. Public
debt is sustainable and robust to macroeconomic and oil price shocks (Figure 3.3). All the
standard stress tests suggest that the debt ratio is likely to remain modest even under shocks
from contingent liabilities, sharp exchange rate movements, and higher interest rates.

Appendix 4. Indonesia—Ensuring a Sustainable Medium Term
Fiscal Framework1
Fiscal reforms are needed in Indonesia that broaden the tax base, gradually eliminate energy subsidies,
and ensure sound budget implementation in order to buttress the medium­term fiscal framework,
maintain a low level of public debt, and support inclusive growth. In recent years, tax revenues (as a
share of GDP) have stagnated; energy subsidies have taken a larger share of the budget; and
development expenditures have underperformed against budget targets. The current fiscal rule limits
the general government deficit to 3 percent of GDP. Meeting increasing social spending needs over the
medium term will require either substantially higher budget revenues or lower spending on other
expenditure items. Efforts are needed to mobilize tax revenues from the non­oil and gas sector in order
to expand fiscal space necessary to finance increased spending.
Current Challenges
Revenues
1.
The collection of tax revenues in Indonesia remains constrained by the narrowness of
the tax base, dependence on the commodity
sector, and weak administration. At present, the
tax revenue to GDP ratio is one of the lowest in
the G­20 and among emerging market economies
(EMEs). Under the current tax regime, collections
are not expected to increase substantially in the
medium term. Averaging 10.9 percent of GDP over
the past five years (Figure 4.1), low tax revenue
mobilization in general limits available fiscal
resources and makes Indonesia more vulnerable
to cyclical forces. It also constrains the
government’s ability to concentrate more
resources on social and development spending,
notably new social protections being introduced
from 2014 and basic infrastructure needs.
2.
The structure of the tax system has remained broadly unchanged in Indonesia over the
past decade, while tax policy has undergone only small modifications. These changes have
included decreases in the corporate income tax (CIT) and personal income tax (PIT) rates in response
to the economic downturn in 2008; increases in the personal allowance in the PIT system; and
introduction of a small­enterprise taxation regime in 2013. Notwithstanding a nearly fourfold
increase in registered taxpayers the past decade, tax administration remains relatively weak, with
poor enforcement procedures and low voluntary compliance. Progress on tax audits and arrears
collections has also been slow.

3.
The declining contribution of oil and gas revenues to the budget over the past five
years has made collection of tax revenues from other sources even more important. Weak oil
and gas revenues are mainly due to a steady decline in oil production, which is likely to continue in
the coming years. Oil and gas revenues also remain highly sensitive to movements of world prices
and exchange rates. For example, a US$10 increase in the price of oil would raise projected revenues
in 2013 by about 0.3 percentage points to 3.5 percent of GDP.
Expenditures
4.
Government expenditures remain heavily skewed toward subsidies, leaving limited
space for spending on investment and poverty alleviation. The total subsidy bill increased from
2.5 percent of GDP in 2009 to 4.2 percent of GDP in 2012, while development spending remained at
2.7 percent of GDP. Low development spending is due in part to problems with budget
implementation. At the same time, development spending is the single largest item in the budget
over which the government can exercise full discretion. Thus, the government has used it as a buffer
for revenue shortfalls and subsidy overruns. This comes at the detriment of longer term strategic
planning and social and infrastructure needs.
5.
Despite the June 2013 fuel price increase, almost 90 percent of subsidies remain
energy related (Table 4.1). As a result, the subsidy bill is sensitive to movements in world oil prices
and the exchange rate (Figure 4.2). For example, if oil prices were to rise by 10 percent or the rupiah
to weaken by 10 percent vis à vis the U.S. dollar, staff estimate that energy subsidies would increase
by 0.6 percentage points to 4.3 percent of GDP in 2014. An elimination of fuel subsidies over the
medium term would create more space for social and capital spending and reduce the exposure of
the budget to external shocks.

6.
Focusing on development expenditures, capital spending has risen in nominal terms,
but continues to perform below budget, while social spending has been suppressed by
subsidy costs. Over the past five years, annual disbursements of capital spending have been
70−90 percent of the amount budgeted. Compared with other Asia­Pacific and EMEs, total capital
spending by general government in Indonesia is in the midrange, suggesting scope for increased
investment. Improved execution of budgeted expenditure at the subnational levels remains key
here, where a sizable share of capital outlays is disbursed but where implementation capacity
remains the weakest. While one off factors (e.g., temporary transfers to offset fuel subsidy
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

57

INDONESIA

reductions) may have affected social spending, the general trend has been a decline in recorded
outlays (as a share of GDP), making it more difficult for the government to achieve desired social
outcomes without additional support for vulnerable groups. To Indonesia’s credit, poverty rates
have continued to fall (Figures 4.3 and 4.4), but they remain relatively high for a low middle income
country. According to the World Bank, Indonesia spends 0.5 percent of GDP on household social
assistance, compared to a regional average of 1.0 percent of GDP and a developing countries’
average of 1.5 percent of GDP. Indonesia’s investment in human capital also remains low in
comparison with other Asian and developing countries. Education spending (including personnel
costs), as a share of GDP, has averaged around 3 percent in the last decade, about the midrange of
comparable countries (Figure 4.5). Health spending, on the other hand, is considerably lower in
Indonesia compared to its peers, averaging only around 0.9 percent of GDP (Figure 4.6).

58

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

INDONESIA

Medium Term Fiscal Priorities
7.
In the medium term, key structural fiscal reforms are needed to ensure fiscal
sustainability and support economic growth. Reforms should focus on continuing efforts to
mobilize revenues, eliminate the energy subsidies, and strengthen budget implementation, in order
to create additional space for social and infrastructure spending, reduce Indonesia’s vulnerability to
external shocks, and improve the effectiveness of fiscal policy.
Tax Revenue
8.
Concerted efforts are needed to raise the tax revenue to GDP ratio by strengthening
broad based taxes, reducing exemptions and incentives, and improving tax compliance.1 Estimations
suggest that over the medium term, Indonesia could raise tax revenues by about 4−5 percentage
points of GDP by strengthening both direct and indirect taxes, as well as revenues from the mining
sector.
9.
Indonesian tax law provides a comprehensive and generally well designed tax regime,
but implementation remains a challenge and tax bases need to be broadened. On direct taxes,
the base of the CIT has been eroded by use of extensive tax incentives. In addition, the base is not
protected by rules against thin capitalization which make it easy to transfer the tax base to other
jurisdictions. The government needs to fully analyze the prevalence and cost of tax expenditures as
part of a base broadening strategy. On indirect taxes, revenue productivity is low due to extensive
exemptions, leaving room for base broadening as well. Indonesia’s natural resource tax regime is in
line with international practice and the income tax rates and royalty charges are broadly appropriate,
but more could be done to capture rents and minimize disincentives for investment and production.
Furthermore, the high level of export taxes on some minerals discourages production and
investment.
10.
Taxpayers comprise a relatively narrow segment of the population, but their share
(both for individuals and corporations) has been steadily increasing over the last decade. The
current challenge is to raise the number of tax returns filed by registered taxpayers, therefore
increasing their compliance. At the same time, an increased number of tax returns entails greater
administrative burden on the tax authority, which could be alleviated by improving capacity and
simplifying administration.
Energy Subsidies
11.
Further reforms to energy subsidies are needed to generate the fiscal space necessary
to address near term pressures and allow more productive spending over the longer term. In
the absence of subsidy reform, but with world oil prices expected to moderate over the projection
horizon, energy subsidies are projected to gradually decrease to around 2.8 percent of GDP by 2018,

but still remain above the 2010 level as a share of GDP.1 Fuel subsidies constitute a substantial fiscal
risk to the budget, especially with fuel consumption expected to grow faster than real GDP over the
medium term. Electricity subsidies have also been on the rise, almost doubling since 2009 as a share
of GDP, despite intermittent price adjustments.
12.
Both fuel and electricity subsidies should be gradually eliminated over the medium
term by raising prices to the cost recovery levels. Currently, most of the benefits of energy
subsidies accrue to high income households. Cutting energy subsidies would open considerable
fiscal space for social and development spending and also eliminate some of the risks to budget
execution associated with the current fuel subsidy system. Some of the savings generated could
compensate vulnerable groups through targeted social programs. The government should also
consider tackling the rapid growth in LPG subsidies and move ahead with planned reforms of the
electricity subsidy.
Social Security System
13.
Current plans to increase spending on social protections are well placed, but will
require careful execution to bring Indonesia in line with comparator countries. The 2004
Sistem Jaminan Sosial Nasional (SJSN) or National Social Security System Law contains provisions
both for health and pension insurance. The law sets out the gradual introduction of a universal
health care system that will cover the entire population, including both formal and informal workers.
Formal sector workers will pay a fixed percent payroll tax (the current rate is set at 5 percent); while
informal sector workers will be required to pay a fixed monthly contribution (the proposal was
Rp 35,000 per month per person). Contribution of poor and near poor households will be paid by
the central government. The proposed 2014 budget uses a monthly contribution of Rp 19,200 per
person for Indonesia’s 86 million poor and near poor, with Rp 25 trillion (0.2 percent of GDP)
allocated next year for this purpose.
14.
The projected spending on these new protections remains uncertain, in part due to
concerns about the capacity of the government to execute them. The government is not only
responsible for paying contributions for the poor, but also for covering any gap between
contributions and spending of the health fund. The 5 percent contribution rate may not be sufficient
to cover the direct health care costs of formal sector workers and their dependents, posing an
additional burden on the budget. However, about 75 million individuals that either work in the
informal sector or are not covered by the budget are expected to pay the fixed monthly
contribution. Collection of these contributions will be difficult, especially in the early years of the
transition. A further risk for the budget is that public health spending is likely to grow faster than
income and will require development of additional capacity financed by the central government. The
SJSN Law also establishes a pension program for salaried workers to be implemented starting
in 2015. The contribution rate has not yet been decided. Along with the pension program, the
introduction of a minimum social pension could help reduce poverty among the elderly.

1

Staff’s baseline differs from this number since the medium-term projection incorporates a gradual elimination of
fuel and electricity subsidies.

60

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

INDONESIA

Infrastructure Investment
15.
Meeting infrastructure needs requires scaling up of public investment and improving
the quality of spending to ensure that supply­side bottlenecks do not constrain growth
(Figures 4.7 and 4.8). The pattern for spending to be concentrated in the last few months of the
fiscal year constitutes a particular problem in budget implementation (typically 50−60 percent of
capital spending is disbursed in the last quarter) and contributes to the low level of budget
execution in public investment. To address this concern, new procurement regulations were put in
place in 2011. The government revised spending rules and simplified procurement procedures to
speed up disbursements. However improvements remain to be seen. The slow acquisition of land
has also affected infrastructure spending, with a new land acquisition law enacted in 2012 aim at
speeding up this process. Progress has been made in issuing supporting regulations, including the
establishment of financing mechanisms for acquiring land for public projects.

16.
At the general government level, concerns remain about the accountability of local
governments and capacity of the central government to monitor their activities. The fiscal rule
limits the general government deficit to 3 percent of GDP. Therefore, shortcomings in budget
planning and execution at the central government level can adversely affect budget planning at the
local government level, and vice versa. Enhanced monitoring of local budgetary developments is
needed to allow the more accurate planning of the central government’s capital budget. In addition,
the system for preparing local budgets needs to be reviewed. Currently, local governments are given
incentive grants for early submission of good quality budget plans. However, delays in central
government budget preparation make it difficult for local governments to prepare their own
budgets on time. Budget reporting by local governments is improving, but is still subject to long
lags and does not follow the IMF Government Finance Statistics reporting standards.

Appendix 5. Indonesia—Banking Sector Stability1
Financial System Structure
1.
Despite rapid growth over the past
decade, Indonesia’s financial system is
small compared with its peers,2 with total
assets at end­2012 accounting for 68 percent
of GDP.3 Within the financial system, banks
dominate, accounting for around four fifths
of the financial system’s total assets
(Table 5.1). However, bank credit to the
private sector is also small compared with
peers, at only 35 percent of GDP at
end­June 2013, but up from 22 percent a
decade ago. At the same time, cross border
intermediation is comparatively large given
sizable funds held abroad, particularly in
Singapore. Insurance companies form the
largest component of nonbank financial
institutions (NBFIs), accounting for slightly
more than 10 percent of the financial
system’s total assets. Remaining NBFIs
primarily comprise finance companies, which
conduct some shadow banking activities.4

Financial markets are also generally less developed than other major emerging market
economies (EMEs). As of end­2012, stock market capitalization was equivalent to 49 percent of
GDP, with free floating stocks accounting for only 37 percent of the total. Outstanding debt
securities issued domestically amounted to 15 percent of GDP, with government securities
accounting for 85 percent of the total. Both bond and stock markets have a relatively large share of
foreign investors, with foreign holdings accounting for roughly one third of government bonds and
three fifths of free floating equities.

In this note, the financial system comprises all financial institutions, including both banks and nonbank financial
institutions such as insurance companies, mutual funds, pension funds, and finance companies.

Finance companies are broadly sound, with low leverage (equity as a share of total assets was 20 percent at
end‐2012) and high profitability (the return on assets was 3.8 percent in 2012). However, as non‐depository
institutions, their funding structure is less stable than depository institutions, with 50 percent of their funding coming
from domestic banks, 35 percent from foreign banks, and 15 percent from the issuance of debt securities.

Recent Banking Sector Performance
3.
The banking sector appears generally sound, although some divergence exists within
the system. Financial soundness indicators of Indonesian banks broadly improved in 2012 (see
Table 8 in main text of the staff report) and also compare favorably with peers (Figure 5.1). Key
noteworthy aspects are:


Banks are well capitalized in absolute terms and against major EME and ASEAN peers,
but the quality of capital remains an issue (see paragraph 13). The system wide capital
adequacy ratio (CAR) was 17.5 percent at end­June 2013, unchanged from a year earlier.
Large private domestic banks generally have lower capital levels (Table 5.3). Capital largely
comprises Tier­1 capital, with a system wide Tier 1 CAR at 16.1 percent.



Profitability is high, with earnings in recent years benefiting from strong economic
growth and wide net interest margins. The return on assets of Indonesian banks
amounted to 2.6 percent in 2012, comparatively high among major emerging market and
ASEAN peers. Profitability tends to be lower at small private domestic banks, in part due to
higher operating costs given more limited economies of scale.



Liquidity remains ample, although the system wide liquidity ratio was relatively low
among peers. At end June 2013, the ratio of liquid assets to short term liabilities was
34 percent; however, it would be well above 100 percent if stable funding such as current
and savings deposits were excluded from short term liabilities, suggesting that the banking
system as a whole is not subject to significant liquidity risk. That said, bank liquidity is not
evenly distributed across the system, with small private domestic banks holding less liquid
assets relative to their balance sheets, which bears close watch.



Asset quality has been improving, with broadly adequate provisions for
nonperforming loans (NPLs). NPLs at end­June 2013 were 1.8 percent of total loans, down
from 3.3 percent at end­December 2009. For most banks, NPLs are well provisioned, with the
loss provisions for impaired loans at about 130 percent of NPLs for the banking system as a
whole. However, provisions for NPLs may not be adequate at some regional public banks
and small private domestic banks.

4.
The banking sector has been relatively insulated from market turbulence arising in
May 2013. The impact of the significant decline in both bond and equity prices on banks has been
minimal, given their limited direct exposure to securities (only about 10 percent of total earning
assets). The wealth effect on other domestic entities has also been small, as foreign investors hold a
sizable share of government bonds and free floating stocks, mitigating spillovers through this
macrofinancial channel and shielding banks from suffering consequential credit losses.
5.
While credit growth has moderated since mid 2012, the recent expansion may pose
elevated risks going forward. Main concerns are as follows:



Macroprudential policy measures implemented in 2012 may not have been as effective
as expected in slowing credit growth and mitigating related risks. The deceleration in
credit expansion since early 2012 has been largely due to a more moderate increase in loans
to businesses, with the growth rate of loans to households roughly unchanged (Figure 5.2).
Macroprudential measures setting caps on loan­to­valuation (LTV) ratios and minimum
down payments for vehicle purchases have slowed recorded growth in housing and auto
loans, but this change has been largely offset by accelerated growth in multipurpose loans,
suggesting a potential diversion of credit in order to circumvent these measures.



Recent credit expansion has been accompanied by a significant increase in property
prices. Residential property prices in major cities have been rising steadily over the past
decade, with prices in the Jakarta area up 10 percent year on year in June 2013 (the increase
appearing substantially larger for high end properties). Nonetheless, loans for housing
purchases and loans to construction companies remain a small portion of banks’ balance
sheets (about 12 percent of total loans). Therefore, the direct impact of property price
reversals on the banking system would likely be limited, although the indirect impact
through macrofinancial linkages such as the household wealth effect could be much greater.



Credit growth has outpaced deposit growth over the past few years, resulting in a
significant rise in loan to deposit ratios (LDRs). As of end August 2013, the system wide
LDR was 89 percent, compared to about 60 percent at end December 2006. Based on
envisaged credit and deposit growth in 2013, the system wide LDR is projected to reach
92 percent by end­2013, with around one­third of all banks expected to have LDRs in excess
of 100 percent (Figure 5.3). Some signs have emerged recently of increasing competition for
bank deposits, as small domestic banks face reduced access to local interbank funding due
to concerns about counterparty risks, while foreign banks confront higher costs to obtain
offshore funding on the back of reduced liquidity in the foreign exchange (FX) market. With
the eventual normalization of U.S. monetary policy and tighter global financial conditions,
Indonesian banks may have to rely even more on domestic funding to support credit
expansion.

1/ Assume the system wide 15 percent growth of loans and 10 percent growth of deposits. Growth rates of individual banks are
adjusted based on the pattern observed across banks in 2012.
2/ Assume an outflow of demand, savings, and time deposits by 6.6, 4.8, and 3.7 percent, respectively (equivalent to 2 standard
deviations of month to month fluctuations), as well as a complete drawdown of short term wholesale funding.
3/ After accounting for complete write downs associated with restructured and special mentioned loans. The estimation also
assumes an expansion of balance sheets by 12.5 percent a year, a compression of net interest margins by 60 bps, and mark to
market losses associated with an increase in government treasury yields by 500 bps.

Risk Factors
6.
The current environment presents a number of challenges to banks in Indonesia,
stemming from slowing economic growth, a less accommodative monetary stance, and higher
funding costs. In the near term, banks will likely face heightened funding pressures, which could
further raise funding costs and/or reduce their liquidity buffers, and also could adversely affect their
profitability. Their balance sheets could also weaken as a result of deteriorating asset quality and
losses stemming from market risk. However, most banks should have adequate capital buffers to
withstand such shocks.
7.
Liquidity risks. Systemic liquidity risk remains low since the bulk of banks’ short term
liabilities come from relatively stable retail funding, namely current and savings deposits. Overall,
most banks have sufficient high quality liquid assets such as cash, securities, and reserves held at BI
to cover a sizable deposit outflow concurrently with a complete withdrawal of short term wholesale
funding. Based on end December 2013 data, the total liquidity gap of banks facing liquidity strains
was estimated at Rp 9 trillion (0.2 percent of total banking system assets). However, the banking
system could face a FX liquidity gap of about US$ 7.5 billion in the event of a system wide shock to
FX liabilities, including deposits, other commitments, and contingent liabilities (i.e. a 5 percent FX
deposit outflow shock, which would represent the single largest monthly withdrawal in the past
decade, simultaneously with an entire drawdown of other FX commitments and contingent
liabilities).
8.
Funding pressures. Rising funding pressures could also weigh on banks’ earnings. More
intense competition by banks for deposits, as well as imperfect pass­through of higher funding costs
66

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

INDONESIA

to borrowers, will likely narrow net interest margins and reduce banks’ profitability. If net interest
margins were to compress by 60 bps (i.e., by one­tenth of the current system wide margin), banks’
return on assets would fall by an estimated 0.5 percentage point and their capital buffers would be
lower by 0.8 percent of risk weighted assets. As small domestic banks appear to be facing more
acute funding pressures, their net interest margins are likely to be more compressed going forward,
potentially eroding their capital buffers more than other banks.
9.
Credit risks. Changes in asset quality are also likely to affect banks’ balance sheets. The
combination of lower economic growth, rising interest rates, and sectoral weaknesses could
significantly worsen the quality of assets on banks’ balance sheets, especially those banks already
carrying sizable restructured and special mention loans. In this regard, state owned banks may be
more vulnerable given that their loan portfolios comprise a larger share of restructured loans
(2.5 percent compared to 1.8 percent system wide) and special mention loans (5.1 percent
compared to 3.7 percent system wide). While banks’ direct exposure to the property sector is
limited, the combination of higher domestic interest rates and a sharp reversal in property prices
could weaken property developers’ and mortgage holders’ ability to service debt, potentially adding
to banks’ credit losses.
10.
Market risks. Banks are also increasingly exposed to market risks in an environment of
rising interest rates and volatile currency movements, but so far these risks remain manageable. For
each 100 bps increase in government treasury yields, mark to market losses would reduce the
system wide CAR by an estimated 0.15 percentage point.1 Even if the total increase were 500 bps,
the banking system could absorb the loss, which would amount to about 20 percent of total net
income on average. Furthermore, risks associated with exchange rate fluctuations should be
monitored closely given that FX lending accounts for 15 percent of total loans, some of which may
not be fully hedged by borrowers. That said, the direct impact of currency movements on banks’
balance sheets appears minimal given a small system wide net open FX position (4.5 percent of
capital at end June 2013).
11.
Capital buffers. Currently, most banks in Indonesia have adequate capital buffers to absorb
sizable credit and market losses. If all current restructured and special mention loans were classified
as NPLs, additional provisions would amount to about Rp 125 trillion (3 percent of total banking
system assets). The system wide CAR as of end­2013 would fall to 14.2 percent from 17.5 percent as
of end­2012, with around 5 percent of banks likely to breach the minimum capital requirement of
8 percent. Even after accounting for these complete write downs of restructured and special
mention loans, the banking system as a whole would still be able to withstand a further increase in
the NPL ratio of 6.8 percentage points to around 9 percent before breaching the minimum capital
requirement (based on a very conservative assumption that all new NPLs would be fully
provisioned).2 However, the capacity to meet additional credit losses varies across banks, with a
number of small private domestic banks potentially exposed to capital shortfalls.

1

Bank Indonesia’s latest stress test, published in its March 2013 Financial Stability Review, suggests a broadly similar
magnitude of mark‐to‐market losses for available-for-sale securities only, with the system-wide CAR falling by 0.31
percentage points following a five percent reduction in bond prices.
2

Bank Indonesia’s latest stress test suggests that losses associated with credit risk would be even smaller. Particularly,
if the NPL ratio increases by 6.5 percentage points, the system-wide CAR would only fall by 1.8 percentage points.

Banking Sector Oversight
12.
The framework for banking sector oversight has been strengthened, with all three
pillars of Basel II implemented in 2012. With the adoption of Basel II, all Indonesian banks are
now using the standardized approach for credit risk under Pillar 1. The risk­based supervisory
approach under Pillar 2 is still at the nascent stage, with BI recently introducing a risk based rating
system covering a bank’s risk profile, profitability, capital adequacy, and corporate governance as a
tool for assessing the soundness in its supervisory framework. Stress testing based on a full fledged
scenario analysis has not been incorporated into individual banks’ Internal Capital Adequacy
Assessment Process or into BI’s systemic risk assessment and supervisory process.
13.
Progress has also been made in addressing gaps in the regulatory framework
identified by the 2010 Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP). Bank Indonesia has
enhanced the prompt corrective action framework by placing banks under intensive supervision and
special surveillance now based on qualitative indicators in addition to simple quantitative indicators
such as CARs. In addition, the criteria for initiating the resolution process for unviable banks have
become more stringent. Furthermore, BI has revised its regulation on the treatment of restructured
loans, allowing them to be reclassified by one notch but only after a borrower has fulfilled
repayment obligations for at least three consecutive periods.
14.
However, a number of regulatory weaknesses identified in the FSAP need to be
addressed. Foremost, Tier­1 capital still includes certain items that do not meet the test of certainty,
permanence, and ability to meet losses on an ongoing basis.1 In addition, certain areas of asset
classification and provisioning regulations remain an issue, although the rules governing
restructured loans have been tightened. Specifically, exposures backed by certain collateral (such as
guarantees) do not have to be classified as NPLs even if they are in default, and the uniform asset
classification norm and the application of forward looking risk assessment in classifying assets are
subject to numerous exemptions.
15.
Finally, several regulations have been introduced in recent years that could undermine
financial stability by distorting incentives in banks’ risk management. Most notably, the
LDR‐linked reserve requirement (adopted in 2010), which imposes surcharges on banks with LDRs
falling outside a stipulated range, could encourage banks below the floor on this reserve
requirement to lend more aggressively to avoid higher surcharges on reserve requirements.2 In
addition, the new regulation issued by BI in 2012 stipulates that banks must allocate 20 percent of
their lending to micro , small , and medium size enterprises by 2018. While around half of all banks
are already in compliance, others may need to substantially alter their business models and risk
management practices in Indonesia to contain potential credit risks arising from a lack of expertise
in lending to this sector.

1

The Tier‐1 CAR would be 2 percentage points lower if adjusted for specific reserves, which may not be usable for
meeting losses, and for unaudited current year’s profits. The ratio would decline further by about 2 percentage points
if net interoffice funds of foreign bank branches are excluded.
2

Currently, the reserve requirement would be 0.1 percentage points higher for each additional LDR (in percentage
points) below 78 percent, and 0.2 percentage points higher for each additional LDR above 92 percent (originally,
100 percent). As of end-2012, about one quarter of banks (accounting for 42 percent of total banking system assets)
had LDRs below 78 percent.

Appendix 6. Indonesia—Labor Market Policies and Economic Growth1
This note provides additional analytical background and supporting empirical evidence on the impact
of labor market policies in Indonesia on structural transformation and economic growth. Cross country
data show that the allocation of labor across sectors affects aggregate labor productivity substantially,
which, in turn, determines growth in income per capita. Moreover, the data identify labor market
rigidity as a significant factor in hampering the efficient reallocation of labor. This finding points to an
important policy lesson, not only for Indonesia but also for other low middle income countries, on
necessary conditions to sustain economic growth and avoid a middle income trap.
Conceptual Background
1.
Labor productivity is a key determinant of GDP per capita. The following identity breaks
down GDP per capita into two parts: aggregate labor productivity and the employment share of
total population in the economy, where:2

Accordingly, a country can become richer, in principle, either by improving labor productivity,
increasing employment share, or both. Cross sectional data suggest that this occurs mostly via the
labor productivity channel. Taking a sample of 46 economies and looking at their growth rates in
per capita GDP and aggregate labor productivity during the period 1996−2007, it can be observed
that for almost all economies changes in labor productivity growth dominated over changes in
employment share in determining per capita GDP growth (Figure 6.1).3 Simple ordinary least squares
(OLS) regressions confirm this (Table 6.1), showing that aggregate labor productivity growth
explains about 92 percent of the variation in per capita GDP growth across countries.4 For this
reason, it is crucial to understand what constitutes aggregate labor productivity.
2.
Aggregate labor productivity may be further decomposed into two parts. The first part
is a simple average of sector level labor productivity; the second part corresponds to total
covariance between each sector’s employment share and labor productivity, which measures the
degree of efficient allocation of labor across sectors.

Prepared by Jaebin Ahn (APD).

2

In this note, gross domestic product and gross value added are used interchangeably at both the aggregate and
sector levels. Accordingly, no distinction is made between labor productivity and value added per worker.
3
Among 50 countries/territories for which data during 1996−2007 are available, the baseline sample excludes the
top two and bottom two countries in terms of the measurement of covariance term to avoid outliers. Results are
robust to both baseline and complete samples. The sample period is chosen to maximize the sample size.
4

Similar results hold when within-country growth in panel or per capita GDP level in the cross section is considered.

If the covariance term is positive, this indicates that more labor is employed in more productive
sectors. On the other hand, if the covariance term is negative, this implies that more labor is
employed in less productive sectors, i.e., labor allocation is relatively inefficient.1

additional productivity growth contributed by the actual efficiency of labor allocation in 2007.1 For
example, in the case of Indonesia, aggregate productivity grew by 16 percent over the sample
period—a rate close to that in Mexico (13 percent). Taking a closer look at the components,
however, striking differences are revealed between the two economies. If labor had been allocated
neutrally across sectors in 2007, Mexico’s aggregate productivity would have been reduced by
1 percent, whereas Indonesia’s aggregate productivity would have increased significantly by as
much as 47 percent. Mexico was able to avoid this loss owing to a relatively more efficient allocation
of labor, whereas Indonesia was not able to realize gains due to its extremely inefficient allocation of
labor.

if every country had shared the same level of labor

force; i.e., labor allocation in 2007 was more efficient in countries that had started at a higher level of
aggregate labor productivity in 1996 (Figure 6.3). The actual convergence of aggregate labor
productivity is estimated to be around 9 percent, which is 5 percentage points lower than the
hypothetical rate of convergence (Table 6.3). In other words, an inefficient allocation of labor in
lower income countries has dampened the speed of convergence in aggregate labor productivity.

Such normalization allows for cross-sectional comparison of the efficiency level of labor allocation, which is absent
in an alternative representation of each component’s contribution-to-growth approach; e.g., McMillan, M., and

Sustainable, eds. by M. Bacchetta and M. Jansen (Geneva: International Labor Organization and World Trade
Organization).

pp. 165−204.

This highlights the important role of improving the efficiency of labor allocation in
promoting economic growth in developing countries.1 A natural question that arises at this point
is what hinders this in some countries. Multiple factors may exist, but this note focuses on the role of
labor market policies because it is considered to be one of the most relevant factors in Indonesia.
Among the different types of variables that can be used to measure labor market policies, two
particular labor cost measures—the legal level of severance pay and the minimum wage—are
examined here.
6.
A cross country comparison shows that a more rigid labor market is associated with a
less efficient allocation of labor, particularly for lower income countries. First, a strong negative
correlation can be observed between the covariance term and severance pay level for countries with
lower initial labor productivity (Figure 6.4). On the other hand, a weak positive correlation appears to
exist between these two variables for countries with higher initial labor productivity (Figure 6.5). The
same is true between the covariance term and the minimum wage level relative to the average wage
(Figures 6.6 and 6.7).

7.
Regression analysis with an interaction term between labor market rigidity and initial
productivity level confirms these relationships (Table 6.4). The main observations can be
summarized as follows:
1
Alternatively, one could argue that income level determines the efficiency of labor allocation because of the
non­homothetic preference for higher productivity sector products.



On average, a negative and statistically significant effect of the severance pay level on the
efficiency level of labor allocation is found (column 1), but controlling for the initial
aggregate productivity level leads to a statistically insignificant effect (column 2).



Adding the initial aggregate productivity level and its interaction term with the severance
pay level leads to a larger negative coefficient estimate on severance pay, with the
interaction term being positive and statistically significant (column 3). This implies that a
high level of severance pay has adverse effects on the efficient allocation of labor,
particularly for a country with a lower initial labor productivity level, but that these effects
are diluted for countries that start from a higher labor productivity level. A statistically
insignificant effect from the initial labor productivity level negates the alternative
explanation that the efficiency of labor allocation simply follows the income level.



The results are similar when labor market rigidity is measured by the relative minimum wage
level (columns (4)−(6)).

Policy Implications for Indonesia
8.
This note finds that the effect of labor market policies depends on the level of
economic development. If policies that hinder efficient allocation of labor are adopted at an earlier
stage of economic development, they may deter economic growth more than if they are adopted at
a later stage. Therefore, ensuring adequate labor market flexibility should be a top priority for low
and middle income countries to promote growth and avoid a middle income trap.

Law introduced in 2003 a factor.2
Furthermore, minimum wages,
which are particularly binding for formal sector jobs predominant in larger scale manufacturing,
have risen rapidly over the past decade, outpacing both inflation and productivity growth, and are
high relative to average wages (Figure 6.8). 3 Given that minimum wages are indexed to
non­minimum wages, the overall result has been a sharp increase in real unit labor costs in the
industrial sector in the past decade.
10.
A close look at changes in
the efficiency of labor allocation
in Indonesia, as measured by the
covariance term, suggests policy
matters. Looking at the past two
decades, labor allocation improved
across sectors in the early 1990s in
the wake of deregulation. However,
greater allocation toward
manufacturing activities suffered a
setback in the run up to and during
the Asian financial crisis and
subsequent introduction of the
Manpower Law (Figure 6.9). In
recent years, Indonesia has shown
signs of reversing this trend, but
sustaining it will require broader
policy actions that help reduce the
rigidity of labor market regulations and align minimum wage growth with productivity growth.
1

Although this note focuses exclusively on the role of labor market rigidity, it is important to acknowledge that other
factors, such as the availability of infrastructure and the strength of the business climate, have been major
impediments to higher growth in the manufacturing sector in Indonesia.
2

The law stipulates an increase in mandated severance pay rates, imposes tighter restrictions on fixed-term contracts
and subcontracting, and establishes the minimum wage-setting mechanism at the provincial and district level.
3

For example, the minimum wage in Jakarta was increased by an average of 44 percent in 2013.

WORLD BANK-IMF COLLABORATION
Background
The working relationship between the IMF and the World Bank in Indonesia is very strong, with joint
working programs in a number of areas and close coordination through frequent meetings between
resident offices and with headquarters missions, including the Article IV consultation.
Key Areas with Joint Programs
Budget Reforms


The reform agenda for budget and treasury remains a high priority for both institutions.
Currently, the Bank’s support is being provided through the Government Financial Management
and Revenue Administration Project (GFMRAP) program, trust funds, and development policy
loans (DPLs), with elements in support of (a) efficient treasury operations, including accounting
reforms, improved in˗year budget disbursement, and regulatory reform; (b) improved linkages
between planning and budget preparation through the implementation of a medium-term
expenditure framework, performance budgeting, and the enhancement of budget flexibility at
the service delivery level; and (c) improved capacity for budget oversight through systems and
organizational reform. The IMF has complemented this work through recent technical assistance
(TA) on subsidy reform and social safety nets aimed at ensuring longer-run fiscal sustainability.

Taxation Issues


Taxation issues are a priority for the Fund and the Bank, with broadening the tax base and
increasing tax revenues an important issue for both macroeconomic stability and the investment
climate. The Fund’s TA currently focuses on tax policy. The Bank’s support for tax administration
reform is executed through trust funds and an investment loan in support of a comprehensive
program for tax administration reform.

Asset-Liability Management


The Bank and the Fund have been leading an effort to improve asset-liability management,
including at the Treasury and Debt Management Office of the Ministry of Finance and at Bank
Indonesia, with continued collaboration envisaged, as needed.

Crisis Preparedness


4

In recent years, the Bank has focused on supporting the authorities in Indonesia to create a
robust crisis prevention and management framework. Most recently, this support has included
analysis of the financial sector stability framework through the 2010 FSAP and a series of crisis
simulation exercises. In 2012 the Bank’s Program for Economic Resilience, Investment and Social
Assistance in Indonesia (PERISAI) DPL also supported the authorities in this area. The Fund has
supported work in this area through past TA on reviewing the legal framework underpinning

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

INDONESIA

Indonesia’s financial stability architecture and in its current surveillance dialogue with the
authorities and exchange of views with the Bank.
Financial Sector


The Bank has focused on broad monitoring of the financial sector. Most recently, through its
Financial Sector and Investment Climate Reform and Modernization DPL, the Bank is supporting
the implementation of reforms aimed at maintaining stability, increasing diversification, and
enhancing financial sector inclusion in Indonesia. The Fund has concentrated on the banking
system, with emphasis on regulation and supervision. It has also embarked on TA in financial
deepening, focused initially on money market development. A joint Bank-Fund FSAP was
completed in 2010 and some recommendations have been followed through by the authorities.
The Bank is to provide TA to implement select FSAP recommendations concerning the nonbank
financial sector.

Statistics


The Bank has a major program of capacity building with the statistics agency that was launched
in 2010. The program is being designed to focus on improvements in key statistical series that
should improve the ability to understand the Indonesian economy, executed through an
institution-wide approach, which includes significant IT and personnel/institutional reforms. The
Fund has focused recent training and TA on government finance statistics.

Macroeconomics


The Fund continues to take the lead in macroeconomic areas, with the Article IV and other
missions, focusing on fiscal, monetary, and exchange rate policies; macrofinancial linkages,
financial sector reforms, and crisis management; and the external position and spillover effects.
The Fund also updates the Debt Sustainability Analysis at the time of the Article IV consultation,
with inputs from the Bank and other development partners. The Bank has also taken on a larger
role, including on macroeconomic monitoring, public policy dialogue, and capacity building,
with ongoing coordination with the Fund. The Bank team continues to assist the Ministry of
Finance‘s Fiscal Policy Office to improve capacity for macroeconomic monitoring, forecasting,
and evidence-based macroeconomic and fiscal policy analysis.

These threads of work are expected to be continued by both parties, with periodic meetings aimed
at keeping each other informed about ongoing work and joint areas of interest. Issues being
addressed include, for the Fund, the external vulnerabilities, exchange rate management, medium‐
term fiscal sustainability, financial stability risks, and labor market rigidities; and for the Bank, the link
between macro/fiscal policy and real economic outcomes, including growth and poverty, resourcesector fiscal revenues, and longstanding problems in the implementation and effectiveness of
government spending.

RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of December 31, 2012)
Asian Development Bank (ADB) cumulative loans to Indonesia reached $28.305 billion as of end
December 2012. The ADB approved a total of $1,232.75 million in loans to Indonesia in 2012, or
11.62 percent of the total loans approved by the institution for the year. The sectors with the largest
shares in cumulative lending are public sector management (18.81 percent), finance (14.93 percent),
agriculture and natural resources (14.30 percent), and energy (13.53 percent).1
Between 1966 and 2012, the ADB provided 527 Technical Assistance (TA) grants to Indonesia
amounting to $366.75 million. The TA grants were financed from the ADB’s TA Special Fund, the
Japan Special Fund, and other sources. Measured by cumulative TA approvals, Indonesia is the
second largest recipient of TA support from the ADB.
The ADB approved a new Country Partnership Strategy 2012−2014 (CPS) with the Government of
Indonesia in May 2012 covering the period 2012−2014. The strategy is aligned with the
Government’s medium-term development plan for 2010−2014 as well as the Masterplan for the
Acceleration and Expansion of Indonesia Economic Development 2011−2025. The CPS is closely
attuned to the needs of Indonesia as a large middle-income country and guided by the
government’s commitment to “pro-poor, pro-job, pro-growth and pro-environment” development.
The two strategic CPS pillars are inclusive growth and environmental sustainability with climate
change, mitigation and adaptation. The ADB will support government efforts to achieve more
inclusive growth by helping to connect poor people and regions to markets by upgrading
infrastructure, improving logistics, and enhancing the skills base needed to boost investment,
productivity, and employment, and by strengthening local government’s capacity for public service
delivery.2

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Indonesia’s macroeconomic statistics are broadly adequate to conduct effective surveillance.
National accounts: Annual and quarterly GDP data are published in a timely manner for both expenditure and
production sides, with 2000 as the base year. The estimates are based on a limited set of indirect indicators of uncertain
quality. Some sectors are influenced strongly by seasonality, and seasonally adjusted data are prepared but not
published. In addition, no survey of nonfinancial services is prepared. The IMF has recommended: (i) development of a
system to continuously update the census of businesses; (ii) introduction of comprehensive annual establishment surveys
for nonfinancial services industries; (iii) publication of annual GDP estimates, including a time series of at least 20 years;
(iv) development of a set of annual supply and use tables (SUTS) starting from 2000; and (v) enhancement of the
convergence exercise on trade data between Bank Indonesia (BI) and the Ministry of Finance (MOF). The revision of the
base year of national accounts to 2010 is in progress with technical assistance (TA) from STA, and GDP estimates based
on improved data sources and methodology are expected by 2013.
Price statistics: Price statistics are broadly adequate for surveillance. Badan Pusat Statistik (BPS), the statistical agency, is
developing a producer price index (PPI) with TA from STA to eventually replace the wholesale price index (WPI). The new
PPI is planned for publication in 2014, covering both the goods and services.
Government finance statistics: Available government finance data suffer from a number of weaknesses, in terms of
classification, coverage, and timeliness. Data on the budget of the central government are available with a one-month
lag, but subnational (provincial and local) government data are available only with a lag of two years, and the quality of
these data varies widely. Problems in budget and accounting systems have been compounded by recent decentralization
initiatives, which have shifted substantial resources to the subnational governments. Significant efforts are being made
to overcome these problems, ranging from the planned adoption of advanced accounting and statistical standards to
the introduction of best-practice budget management processes and the development of computerized financial
management information systems.
Against this background, the MOF is committed to keeping the requirements of fiscal statistics at the forefront of
ongoing fiscal reforms, with better statistical monitoring one of the goals of the current efforts. The coverage and
timeliness of public debt statistics is generally adequate. The new expenditure classification introduced in the 2005
budget is generally consistent with the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001) on functional codes and
classification, although the data are compiled on a cash basis.
The authorities have committed to adopting GFSM 2001 standards. To this end, IMF staff have recommended in the
short term: (i) establishment of a register of all extrabudgetary units; and (ii) inclusion of the economic codes consistent
with the GFSM 2001 in the chart of accounts to ensure that general government units report all transactions and
balances over which they exert control. Over the medium term, priority should be given to (i) establishment of the
underlying reporting arrangements necessary to obtain timely preliminary data for local government statistics; and
(ii) development of a GFSM 2001 operating statement, statements of sources and uses of cash, and partial balance
sheets, all of which should be published on the MOF’s website. Currently, a system has been set up to allow for an
automatic conversion of budget files to GFSM 2001 data; however, these data are yet to be published on the MOF’s
website.
The MOF’s continued efforts to compile GFS data for the general government sector, as part of ongoing public financial
management reforms, are being assisted by STA.

INDONESIA

Monetary and financial statistics (MFS) and financial soundness indicators (FSIs): Good quality monetary statistics
are compiled by BI on a timely basis. With STA assistance, BI has compiled and reported monetary data using the
Standardized Report Forms (SRFs), from which an integrated database and alternative presentations of monetary
statistics can be drawn to meet the needs of BI and the IMF. Bank Indonesia has also compiled monetary data for other
financial corporations (OFCs), comprising only finance companies. To strengthen monetary statistics, STA missions have
also recommended the expansion of the coverage of OFCs to include insurance companies and pension funds of other
depository corporations (ODCs) to include mutual funds. Additional challenges include timely revisions of published
banking sector data after supervisory verification.
With assistance from STA, BI has also compiled and reported FSIs to the IMF, which are published on the Fund’s FSI
website. The FSIs were initially reported on a semiannual basis. However, starting with the Q4:2011 data, BI began
reporting quarterly FSIs to the IMF on a quarterly basis. The FSIs for Indonesia comprise of 11 core FSIs, 12 encouraged
FSIs for deposit takers, 2 encouraged FSIs for OFCs, and 3 encouraged FSIs for the real estate sector. A STA mission in
2011 recommended that BI coordinate with other relevant institutions to explore the possibility of compiling FSIs for
nonfinancial corporations and households.
Balance of payments (BOP): Trade data have been improved in recent years. Starting in 2006, the import/export
transactions of free trade zones are covered in goods data of BOP statistics.
For the capital and financial account, the methodological basis for the compilation of FDI data needs substantial
improvement. Inflows are currently calculated based on loan disbursements to companies that have foreign equity using
a fixed ratio to estimate equity inflows. Surveys conducted by BI to collect FDI data have a low response rate and the
coverage of the directory of enterprises needs to be improved. Other areas that need improvement include the
recording of trade credits and the asset data for portfolio investment and other investment transactions. The magnitude
of the errors and omissions item in the BOP has been large at times and appears to be related to the under˗coverage of
assets in the financial account. Financial transactions data are reconciled with changes in the International Investment
Position (IIP), except data on direct investment.
An annual IIP is compiled, but the underlying data are weak in several areas, notably for FDI. External debt statistics have
improved considerably with the introduction of an External Debt Information System (EDIS) in 2002 and the recent
initiative to publish monthly indicators. Also, as a result of the ongoing reconciliation of data conducted by BI, the IIP
and external debt data are fully consistent. However, improvements are still needed with respect to components of
private corporate sector data, particularly in distinguishing between scheduled and actual debt service, in estimating the
accumulation/reduction of private sector payments arrears, and in estimating reschedulings/debt reductions received by
the private sector from external creditors.

Data Standards and Quality
Subscriber to the Special Data Dissemination Standard
(SDDS) since September 1996, observing most of the
SDDS requirements. Indonesia uses the SDDS flexibility
options for the timeliness of the labor market
categories (employment, unemployment, and
wages/earnings) and general government operations.
It is also availing itself of flexibility options for the
periodicity of labor market categories (employment
and unemployment).

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on Indonesia
November 15, 2013
The information below has become available following the issuance of the staff report. It
does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
1.
Latest data releases are broadly in line with staff’s projections. Real GDP grew
5.6 percent (y/y) in 2013:Q3, down from 5.8 percent in the previous quarter mainly on
continued slow investment growth but supportive consumption. Headline inflation declined
to 8.3 percent (y/y) in October from 8.4 percent in September, mostly due to a sharp drop in
volatile food prices, but core inflation remained at 4.7 percent. Private sector credit growth
was 20.5 percent (y/y) in September, unchanged from August. The current account deficit
was US$8.4 billion in 2013:Q3, compared to US$10.0 billion in the second quarter. The main
factor for the improvement was an increase in the nonoil and gas trade surplus, with a decline
in the value of nonoil imports outpacing the same for nonoil exports. For the first three
quarters of 2013, the current account deficit was US$24.3 billion (3.7 percent of GDP on an
annualized basis). Inward foreign direct investment rose to US$5.4 billion in 2013:Q3 from
US$4.7 billion in the previous quarter, but the overall balance of payments deficit was
broadly unchanged at US$2.6 billion. Gross international reserves rose to US$97 billion
(5.3 months of imports of goods and services) at end October from US$96 billion at end
September.
2.
Bank Indonesia (BI) raised its policy rate by 25 bps to 7.5 percent on
November 12. Deposit and lending facility rates were also increased by 25 bps to
5.75 percent and 7.5 percent, respectively. According to BI, the move was taken in order to
further reduce current account pressures and bring inflation back to around its target band of
4.5±1 percent in 2014.
3.
The government announced a set of policy measures on November 1 aimed at
improving the ease of doing business. Among the measures were streamlined procedures
for starting up a business, registering ownership rights of land and buildings, and receiving
building permits, as well as connecting to electricity, making tax payments, contributing to
social security program. The government indicated that a plan for implementing the whole
set of measures would be in place by February 2014.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with Indonesia
On November 15, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation1 with Indonesia.
Over the past decade, Indonesia has established a track record of strong economic performance
and resiliency, underpinned by sound macroeconomic management and corporate and banking
sector reforms. In recent years, its economy has benefitted from a supportive global economic
environment, namely in the form of a rise in commodity prices and strong growth in emerging
markets. However, these conditions have been less supportive lately, resulting in slowing export
growth. Combined with rising net oil and gas imports, the current account shifted into a deficit
in 2012. Nonetheless, real GDP growth in 2012 remained strong at 6¼ percent, aided by
domestic conditions, while inflationary pressures stayed low.
Going forward, the near-term outlook reflects the more challenging global environment that
Indonesia faces. Growth is projected to slow to around 5−5½ percent in 2013 and 2014 on
weaker investment and external demand. Inflation is expected to reach 9½ percent (year-on-year)
in 2013, owing to fuel and food price increases and the recent rupiah depreciation, before easing
back to around 6 percent in 2014. The current account deficit is projected to remain above
3 percent of GDP in 2013 and 2014, mainly on account of a weakening in the terms of trade and
measured growth in external demand. Foreign direct investment and net portfolio inflows are
expected to moderate but still be supportive, notwithstanding heightened market volatility since
mid 2013 associated with prospects of an end to unconventional monetary policies in the United
States. Despite a drawdown in the first half of 2013, reserves are expected to remain adequate.
The authorities have taken significant steps since mid 2013 to address external and fiscal
imbalances, ease inflation pressures, and reduce market volatility. Fiscal performance has been

aided by a hike in subsidized fuel prices in June, to check the rise in energy subsidies, while
monetary policy has been tightened through a substantial increase in policy rates. To ensure an
orderly adjustment, exchange rates and bond yields have moved to reflect market conditions.
Other measures have aimed at strengthening the supply side of the economy. Contingent
financing arrangements have also been put in place to help cushion the impact of any new shocks
or prolonged market disruptions.
Banks remain well capitalized and highly profitable, having been supported in recent years by
strong economic growth and wide interest margins. Asset quality has continued to be strong.
Along with monetary policy actions, macro-prudential measures have been taken to slow credit
growth, but loan-to-deposit ratios have continued to rise. The ongoing transition of bank
supervision and regulation from Bank Indonesia to Otoritas Jasa Keuangan (the financial
services agency) continues as planned. At the same time, gaps remain in the crisis management
framework, which are expected to be filled by a financial sector safety net law when approved by
parliament.
Indonesia’s longer-term outlook hinges on the pace of structural reforms to raise productivity,
create new export markets, and generate more inclusive growth. Key reforms include accelerated
infrastructure investment, a more predictable trade and investment regime, greater labor market
flexibility, and deeper financial markets.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors noted the authorities’ strong track record of prudent macroeconomic policies
and commended their efforts to contain external and fiscal imbalances, reduce inflation, and
manage market volatility in the wake of recent external shocks. Looking ahead, Directors
encouraged the authorities to strengthen the resilience of the Indonesian economy by rebuilding
policy buffers, addressing emerging vulnerabilities, and stepping up structural reforms.
Directors welcomed the actions taken by the authorities to tighten monetary policy. They agreed
that additional monetary tightening might be necessary to facilitate balance-of-payments
adjustment and better anchor inflation expectations. In this regard, Directors supported efforts to
strengthen the monetary transmission mechanism and develop the money and foreign exchange
markets to improve liquidity management. Directors also underscored the importance of
continued exchange rate flexibility to dampen the impact of external shocks.
Directors considered that fiscal policy should support the orientation of monetary policy, and
generally agreed that a moderate consolidation would be appropriate for the period ahead.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

3
Measures should include bolstering tax collection and sustaining energy subsidy reform in the
context of well-targeted safety nets. Directors also highlighted the importance of opening up
fiscal space for infrastructure investment to lift longer-term growth prospects.
Directors commended steady advances in ensuring the soundness of the domestic financial
system. Implementation of pending recommendations under the Fund’s Financial Sector
Assessment Program (FSAP), notably as regards the quality of banks’ capital, would cement the
progress thus far. More broadly, Directors stressed the importance of avoiding oversight gaps in
the transition to a new supervisory architecture, and of putting in place an effective crisis
management framework. Directors also encouraged the authorities to address remaining
deficiencies in the regime for the prevention of money laundering and terrorism financing.
Directors agreed that reforms to reduce supply bottlenecks, enhance the business climate,
increase labor market flexibility, and open up trade and investment remain key to strengthening
competitiveness and the external position, and to bolstering growth and employment. They took
note of the staff’s assessment that Indonesia’s external position appears to be moderately weaker
than implied by medium-term fundamentals.

Statement by Wimboh Santoso, Executive Director for Indonesia
and Evie Akbar, Advisor to Executive Director
November 15, 2013
On behalf of the Indonesian authorities, we would like to thank the IMF mission team for the
candid dialogue during the Article IV consultation. The mission took place at the period of
heightened pressures on Indonesian economy, and accordingly the policy discussions focused
on restoring stability and reducing vulnerabilities. While appreciating the coverage of
discussions with staff, the authorities expressed their concern on the staff’s way of portraying
the Indonesian economy, which covers only a snapshot of short period developments and less
emphasis on the complete storyline of the economy’s dynamic. The authorities are of the
view that the staff report should have covered much broader perspective on the Indonesian
economy. It should encompass the domestic economy’s resilience throughout the recent
years’ global economic turbulence relative to its peers, the authorities’ policy intention at the
back of recent economic performance, and the latest encouraging developments in
Indonesia’s economy. Overall, the report unfairly captures authorities’ intention to prioritize
stability in order to safeguard growth sustainability. Accordingly, this Buff statement is
critical to provide broader viewpoint on the dynamic of Indonesian economy.
Recent Economic Development and Outlook
1. Measures and structural reforms taken in the aftermath of the Asian Crisis in 1997/1998
combined with prudent macroeconomic management have brought Indonesian economy
in a strong position. The economic performance in the last 5 years has been outstanding
with stability intact and average GDP growth reaching 6%. Based on staff appraisal on
the previous Article IV consultation, in terms of its fundamentals, Indonesia was in a
strong position from which to navigate through global macroeconomic uncertainties. The
Executive Directors, as reflected in the acting chair’s summing-up commended the
authorities for their sound economic management, which has helped Indonesia maintain
its strong economic performance despite a challenging global economic environment.
This solid foundation has supported Indonesian economy to remain resilient in recent
periods of external shocks. Nonetheless, growing with the speed of more than 6%, the
Indonesian economy in nature would need sufficient support of imported capital goods
and services. The allegedly sustainable CA deficit has emerged to become external
imbalances as Indonesia’s export performance slowed down due to the weakening of
global economy.
2. The condition has been worsened by the tapering off issue, especially in the form of
volatile capital flows. By the end of Q2-13, the economy experienced amounting
pressures on the Rupiah exchange rate as well as the external stability. The condition
triggered the authorities to shift the macroeconomic strategy by putting forward the
stability over the economic expansion, in order to preserve the sustainability of economic
growth.

3. Noting that the global economy is undergoing a fundamental shift, the Indonesian
authorities put greater effort to safeguard the smooth adjustment on the economic strategy
to ensure a soft landing process into a new equilibrium. Series of policy packages have
been launched to counterbalance the recent pressures since August 2013. The policy
measures are focused on narrowing current account deficit, curbing inflation, preserving
monetary and foreign exchange stability, as well as promoting investment and
maintaining sustainable economic growth. Those policy measures would complement the
existing structural reform policies which have been underway.
4. The authorities are well aware of the consequences of the soft-landing strategy, i.e. that
the economic growth must be revised downward. Under this strategy, however,
Indonesian economy remains growing at a modest pace of 5.62% (y-o-y) or 5.83% (y-t-d)
in the Q3-2013. This figure is consistent with the authorities’ projection range, which is
between the 5.5% – 5.9% level of growth for 2013 (much higher than the expected
average growth of ASEAN-5 (5%)). The inflation rate is expected not to exceed 9% at
the end of 2013 supported by the slowing down in domestic demand and policy
coordination measures between Bank Indonesia (BI) and the government in containing
inflation. As a matter of fact, inflation has returned to its normal pattern at -0.35% (m-tm) or 8.4.0% (y-o-y) in September, and 0.09% (m-t-m) or 8.32% (y-o-y) in October,
down from its peak of 3.28% (m-t-m) in July 2013. As the inflationary pressures subdue,
the authorities foresee inflation rate in 2014 to continue in a downward trend to be in line
with the 2014 target range of 4.5% + 1%.
5. The pressure on Balance of Payments is expected to ease as current, capital and financial
account improve starting Q3-2013. The policy measures to enhance current account are
pursued to bring the current account deficit at its sustainable level around 3% in 2013 and
further below 3% in 2014.
6. Current market condition moves to the direction of stabilization. The level of Rupiah
exchange rates have stabilized, accompanied by a gradually larger interbank volume.
Onshore and offshore (Non Deliverable Forward/NDF) rates have converged and the
NDF rate now moves to the level below the onshore spot rates, simultaneously with the
surging of capital inflows to the government bond market. These reflect international
confidence on the commitment of the authorities to maintain macroeconomic stability
and the prospect of the economy.
7. Following the authorities’ policy responses, the international reserves also improved,
reaching $97 billion in October 2013. The reserve is adequate to cover 5.3 month of
imports and government’s external debt service payments and is still above the IMF’s
regular metrics on the reserve adequacy level. In view of the delay in the tapering of the
UMP and the authorities’ policy to allow exchange rate to adjust consistent with
prevailing economic fundamental, the authorities expect the reserves to stay around the
same level by the end of 2013, higher than staff’s projection of $88.7 billion. The

authorities also continue to strengthen its second line of defense to ensure BI’s capacity
to absorb the market volatility, among others through entering bilateral swap arrangement
with regional central banks.
8. Following the recent adjustment of energy subsidy and its compensating spending on the
budget, the fiscal deficit is set to record at 2.38% of GDP in 2013. Nonetheless, the debt
level is maintained prudently, which stood at 23.7% in June 2013, declining from 33%
in 2008. The financial stability remains in check as indicated by the high level of capital
adequacy ratio and low level of NPL.
9. Notwithstanding the current encouraging development, the authorities would continue to
remain vigilant to weather the persisting global economic uncertainties.
Monetary Policy and Exchange Rate Policy
10. The authorities have responded to manage the current problems of increasing pressures
on inflation and BOP. They also broadly support with thrust of the importance of
strengthening monetary policy transmission mechanism to improve the effectiveness of
monetary policy as staff rightly pointed it out in the report. Understanding the specific
nature of the economic and financial system, BI reponses with a policy mix, ranging
from monetary policy, macro-prudential policy, financial deepening and communication
strategy to ensure the soft landing process of the economy. Burden to restore
macroeconomic and financial stability cannot be put on policy rate solely.
11. Until the issuance of the staff report, the policy rate and the overnight deposit facility rate
have been raised by 150 bps since June 2013 to 7.25% and 5.5% respectively to anchor
inflation expectation. This policy had brought down the spike in inflation rate following
the fuel prices hike to its normal path. While the inflation rate in 2014 is projected to lay
within the target range of 4.5 + 1%, BI stands ready for further tightening to restrain
increased inflationary pressures as well as reduce current account deficits under certain
circumstances. In fact, the BI Board of Governors earlier this week has decided to further
raise the policy rate by 25 bps in view of the remaining pressure on current account
deficit amidst the high global uncertainties.
12. To restore the financial market stability, BI continues to adopt flexible exchange rate so
as the rate moves along with its fundamental value. In addition, the authorities have
introduced various market instruments to deepen financial market and increase market
liquidity, including FX Swap transactions and tradable central bank rupiah deposit. The
authorities has also introduced new regulation on hedging activities by the state-owned
companies,

Fiscal Policy
13. The authorities have consistently adopted prudent fiscal policy by placing hard-cap on the
deficit i.e. not more than 3% of GDP. Fiscal deficit was successfully maintained less than
2% of GDP for the last 10 years and the debt to GDP ratio continued to decrease.
For 2013, the authorities have four strategies to keep fiscal position strong. These
strategies are: optimizing the revenue, increasing the quality of spending, controlling
budget deficit, and decreasing debt to GDP ratio.
14. On optimizing the revenue, the authorities carried out the tax reforms by enhancing tax
payable administration, broadening the tax based and increasing tax compliance, and also
improved SOEs performance to enhance non-tax revenue. Meanwhile, improving the
quality of spending was executed through allocating higher budget for capital
expenditure, social assistance spending and targeted subsidies. The authorities also have
intention to strengthen the debt management by reducing the Debt to GDP ratio to 23%
in 2013.
15. In response to recent shock, the government has revised its 2013 budget. The energy
subsidy has been reduced through the hike in fuel prices by 22.3% for diesel and 44.4%
for gasoline in June 2013. Additional budget for social protection; and infrastructure, as
well as the improvement efficiencies in line ministries spending have been implemented.
These are consistent to the effort to increase potential growth in the medium-term and
protect people’s purchasing power. Along with the lower GDP growth, the adjustment
has widened the fiscal deficit to 2.38% of GDP. Nonetheless, the authorities commit to
maintain solid fiscal position and ensure that the budget deficit remain sound.
16. The authorities share the staff’s view on the need of fiscal policy to support monetary
policy in addressing external pressures. Accordingly, the government issued policy
packages to improve current account performance by issuing regulation to increase the
portion biodiesel in diesel fuel to reduce oil import and provide tax relief to the exportoriented industries to encourage export. Furthermore, the government also released
regulation to improve the trade system of some volatile foods that would contribute to
manage volatile food prices, thus it would lessen inflationary pressure.
Financial Sector Policy
17. Indonesia has built a stronger financial system in the aftermath of 1997/1998 Asian crisis.
Important steps have been taken toward restructuring financial sector since the post crisis
to restore solvency of banking system and improve banking regulations and supervision,
including the adoption of Basel Core Principles in Banking Supervision (BCBS). Capital
adequacy regime has been in line with Basel II principles and moving forward to
implement Basel III. As a result, Indonesia’s financial sector resilience has been tested in
the turmoil of 2005 and Lehman’s crisis in 2008. To monitor the vulnerabilities of
financial sectors, stress testing models have been routinely simulated to asses top down

and bottom up resiliency of the financial system as a basis for further policy mitigation
by authorities. Results of the assessment have been published regularly in the financial
stability report every six months.
18. The efforts are being reflected from various indicators, namely the Capital Adequacy
Ratio (CAR) which is recorded at 18%, well above the minimum requirement of 8% and
the ratio of NPL arriving at just 1.86% in September 2013. The credit growth starts to
moderate, hovering around 20%, in line with decelerating domestic economy activities.
Moreover, the result of stress testing indicated resilient banking industry to the variety of
risks, including an economic downturn, interest rate hike, and exchange rate depreciation.
Furthermore, the authorities have addressed a number regulatory weaknesses identified in
the FSAP, including the remaining weakness identified in tier 1 capital framework.
19. The authorities have also deployed macro prudential policies to maintain the stability of
the financial system and promote internal and external balance. Measures are varied from
setting the LTV level for mortgages and down payments on motor vehicle loans, pursuing
supervisory actions and enhancing the liquidity management of banks. The authorities
predict that the policies would reduce the credit growth to the level of 19%-20% at the
end of the year.
20. The authorities take note of staff’s concern regarding the transfer of banking supervision
to the Financial Services Authority (OJK) and coordination of macro and microprudential surveillance. In this regard, BI and OJK have signed memorandum of
understanding (MOU) to smooth-out the transfer process of banking supervision and
strengthen the cooperation and coordination between two institutions. The MOU
stipulates the cooperation and coordination in executing the roles and responsibilities of
each agency, including the collaboration in formulating of policies/regulations for
financial industry and executing macro and micro-prudential surveillance. It also
specifies the agreement to exchange data and information so both institutions will have
an access to data and information of banking system.
21. The authorities are mindful on the importance of the Financial Sector Safety Net (FSSN)
Law to support the effective management of systemic crisis. While the authorities expect
the law to be in place, stronger coordination among institutions under the Financial
System Stability Forum (FKSSK) would complement current crisis management
framework to deal with the systemic crisis. Furthermore, the authorities are in the process
of amending the BI and banking laws that would strengthen the Crisis Management
Protocol framework.
Structural Reforms
22. The authorities are fully aware that accelerating structural reforms is the key to achieve
sustainable growth in medium term. To enhance supply capacity and potential economic
growth, the authorities will continue to pursue structural reforms in reducing the

infrastructure bottlenecks. As part of this effort, the government launched policy to
promote investment in August 2013. The policy covers streamlining process for
investment’s permit, improving single window service for investment, revising the
regulation of negative investment lists and resolving the problem arose in strategic
investment projects, such as power plant, oil, gas, mineral mining and infrastructure
project. Furthermore, to facilitate trade and investments, the government would spend the
capital expenditure to build seaports, roads, railways, energy and airports.
Conclusion
23. To conclude, Indonesia has successfully navigated the turbulence and put forward the
stability commitment since the Asian crisis 1997. While the latest development shows a
