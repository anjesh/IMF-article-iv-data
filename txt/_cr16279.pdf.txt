IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with Barbados
On August 22, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with Barbados.
The economy appears to have turned the corner with activity picking up. Real GDP grew by
0.8 percent in 2015, underpinned by an increase in private investment and surge in tourism
arrivals, which increased by 14 percent, among the highest in the Caribbean. This boosted
employment by 2 percent, while the unemployment rate fell to 11.3 percent. Inflation eased
owing to lower import prices, with end-period prices falling by 2.5 percent, compared with an
increase of 2.3 percent in 2014. The external current account position improved significantly,
reflecting improved terms of trade, as the deficit narrowed from 9.9 percent of GDP in 2014 to
6.7 percent in 2015, primarily reflecting lower oil and other prices. Exports of goods and
services rose mainly due to higher tourism receipts. Net inflows in the capital and financial
account fell, driven by large official amortization payments and lower FDI. As a result, net
international reserves dropped to US$469 million at end-April 2016 (2.8 months of imports).
The fiscal situation remains challenging despite ongoing government adjustment efforts. The FY
2015/16 budget deficit was broadly unchanged at about 7 percent of GDP. Revenue measures,
though raising revenue by 1 percent of GDP, fell short of target due to implementation delays.
On the expenditure side progress on reducing transfers to State Owned Enterprises was also
slower than anticipated, partially attributable to the unbudgeted debt service of one enterprise
and transfers to support infrastructure investment financed by external sources. At endFY2015/16, central government debt excluding (including) securities held by the National
Insurance Scheme (NIS) reached the equivalent of 105.5 (141.6) percent of GDP, from
98.0 (132.3) percent in FY2014/15. The large funding requirements, totaling about 45 percent of
GDP, have been mostly met by the Central Bank of Barbados (CBB), the NIS, and growing
arrears.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

The financial sector remains stable while commercial bank liquidity continues to rise. Private
sector credit growth turned modestly positive in 2015, following two years of decline while
NPLs declined further. Withdrawal of Correspondent Banking Relationships has directly
affected a small number of entities in the International Business and Financial Services (IBFS)
sector, whose growth has stagnated since the global financial crisis. Monetary policy has been
driven by fiscal considerations, as the CBB continued to fund the government through money
creation and with commercial banks’ excess reserves. Interest rates have begun to rise, with
reduced direct intervention by the central bank in the Treasury Bill auctions.
Executive Board Assessment2
The Executive Directors welcomed the pickup in economic growth led by the tourism sector and
the improvement in the external position. At the same time, notwithstanding the authorities’
consolidation efforts, they noted that the large fiscal deficit and a further increase in public debt
remain a challenge. They stressed that continued fiscal adjustment and public sector reforms are
necessary to bring public debt on a downward path, preserve external sustainability, and
improve investor sentiment. They also underscored the need to eliminate impediments to
stronger long-term growth and bolster competitiveness.
Directors commended the authorities’ commitment to fiscal adjustment and reforms. They noted
that further efforts are needed to put the high and growing public debt on a sustainable path,
while minimizing the negative impact on growth and preserving social cohesion. They
welcomed the new measures in the August 2016 budget, including reductions in current
expenditure and new revenue measures, although they cautioned that a further increase in tax
exemptions could erode revenues. Directors underscored the importance of completing the
reform of the revenue authority to improve tax administration and increase compliance. They
stressed that stronger efforts are also needed to reform state-owned enterprises through better
governance, consideration of user fees, and potential divestment and consolidation of public
entities. They also called for swift action to eliminate government arrears.
Directors emphasized that the continued financing of the fiscal deficit by the Central Bank of
Barbados (CBB) is inconsistent with maintenance of the exchange rate anchor. They encouraged
the CBB to allow domestic interest rates to rise in line with increases in U.S. interest rates and
ensure adequate international reserve buffers.
Directors welcomed the recent improvement in the non-performing loan ratio and banks’ liquid
and well-capitalized balance sheets. They encouraged continued close supervision of the
financial sector, particularly of non-bank institutions, including credit unions and insurance

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers

companies. Directors noted that domestic banks have not experienced a decline in correspondent
banking relationships and welcomed the authorities’ efforts with regional partners to understand
the issue. They recommended taking quick action on any shortcomings that might be identified
by the upcoming AML/CFT evaluation.
Directors agreed that a comprehensive growth strategy is needed to lift the country’s long-term
competitiveness in the key tourism sectors. Priorities for raising growth include timely
implementation of tourism investment and infrastructure projects, improving public service
efficiency and streamlining business regulation, increasing labor market flexibility, and
unlocking agriculture’s growth potential.
Directors encouraged continued efforts, with Fund technical assistance, to resolve outstanding
data issues and improve the dissemination of statistics.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
July 7, 2016

KEY ISSUES
Context: The economy appears to have turned the corner but a disappointing fiscal
outcome has not eased concerns about debt sustainability. After protracted stagnation
following the 2008 financial crisis, there was a moderate recovery in 2015 and growth is
set to pick up. Notwithstanding adjustment efforts, the budget deficit remained high,
mainly reflecting delayed implementation of reforms. The large funding requirements
were mostly met by the central bank, the National Insurance Scheme, and growing
arrears. Continued large deficits pose risks to the fixed exchange rate.
Focus of the consultation and key policy recommendations: The discussions focused
on safeguarding macroeconomic stability and supporting the currency peg through a
refocusing of fiscal consolidation efforts. A fiscal adjustment of at least 3.5 percent of
GDP over three years—consistent with a primary surplus of 6 percent of GDP—is
required to reverse the increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio in 2015/16 and place it on a
downward trajectory. An ambitious yet credible adjustment strategy could bolster
business sentiment, leading to increased private investment. Adjustment would need to
be focused on reenergizing reforms in the revenue agency and of state-owned
enterprises, and be accompanied by measures that would strengthen monitoring and
implementation.
Authorities’ views: The authorities broadly agreed with the staff’s assessment of key
challenges and policy recommendations. They acknowledged the need for fiscal
adjustment given the increase in public debt and large financing requirements, and
agreed that the reform would have to be anchored by stronger efforts to improve the
implementation of structural changes in the public sector. At the same time, they noted
that delivering on such reform is complex, particularly given the growing adjustment
fatigue. They noted that effective reform requires a broad stakeholder involvement, but
they remain committed to the reform process given its urgency and necessity.

CONTEXT
1.
The global financial crisis derailed growth while fiscal adjustment was delayed and
insufficient which led to persistent deficits and mounting debt. The crisis hit Barbados through a
combination of factors, mainly a steep fall in tourism, a decline in construction, stagnation in the
international business and financial sector (IBFS), and the collapse of a large, foreign-owned
insurance company. These have had a profound and persistent negative impact on growth that is still
being felt. Average growth during 2008–14 was -0.3 percent, the budget deficit averaged 7.4 percent
of GDP, and central government debt grew from 51.4 percent of GDP at end-FY2007/08 to
105.5 percent at end-FY2015/16. Measurement issues complicate a clear understanding of past
developments, and may also be providing an incomplete picture of recent developments.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
2.
The economy appears to have turned the corner with activity picking up. Real GDP grew
by 0.8 percent in 2015—underpinned by an increase in private investment and a surge in tourism
arrivals—relative to 0.2 percent in 2014. Tourism arrivals increased by 13.9 percent, the highest in the
Caribbean following Cuba and Aruba.1 Employment rose by 2 percent and the unemployment rate
fell to 11.3 percent. Lower import prices pushed consumer prices down, with end-period inflation of
-2.5 percent, compared to 2.3 percent in 2014.
3.
The external current account position has improved significantly, partly reflecting
improved terms of trade. The current account deficit narrowed from 9.9 percent of GDP in 2014 to
6.7 percent in 2015, reflecting a sharp decline in import values due to lower oil and other prices,
notwithstanding increased volumes of oil and intermediate goods imports. Exports of goods and
services rose by 1.7 percent of GDP in 2015, mainly due to a tourism receipt increase of 3.6 percent.
Net financial flows halved from 8.4 percent of GDP in 2014 to 4.0 percent in 2015, driven by large
amortization payments and lower FDI. Net international reserves fell to US$469 million at end-April
2016 (2.8 months of imports), down by US$57 million from end-2014.
4.
Fiscal performance in FY2015/16 was
disappointing. In late 2013, following several
years of large fiscal deficits, the government
renewed reform efforts including a substantial
reduction in public sector employment. After
significant consolidation in FY2014/15, the
government undertook further adjustment
measures, broadly in line with the staff’s
recommendation in the 2015 Article IV (Box 1).

Notwithstanding, the budget deficit in FY2015/16 remained broadly unchanged at about 7 percent
of GDP, well short of the authorities’ objective.2 FY2015/16 budget measures increased revenue by
approximately 1 percent of GDP, short of the government’s target, due to implementation delays. On
the expenditure side, progress toward reducing transfers to State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) was
slow, partially attributable to the unbudgeted debt service of one enterprise and transfers to support
infrastructure investment financed by external sources, to address severe issues with the water mains.
5.
Given the high debt, financing the deficit is challenging. At end-FY2015/16, central
government debt excluding (including) securities held by the National Insurance Scheme (NIS) was
105.5 (141.6) percent of GDP. Rollover requirements are about 45 percent of GDP and new financing
is largely being met by the Central Bank of Barbados (CBB), the NIS (through issuance of debentures
in lieu of cash contributions for wages and salaries), and arrears. On April 1, 2016, Moody's Investors
Service ("Moody's") downgraded Barbados' government bond rating to Caa1 and changed the
outlook to stable, largely on account of the high fiscal deficit and growing debt levels.
6.
Arrears are large and growing. Staff estimates that central government arrears rose from
4.3 percent of GDP at end-FY2014/15 to 5.9 percent at end-FY2015/16, including arrears to the NIS.
SOE arrears are estimated to have risen to 5.5 percent of GDP, of which the largest share is to the
Barbados Revenue Authority (BRA) and NIS. Arrears are impeding private sector transactions,
inhibiting investment, and may be contributing to erosion of tax compliance.
7.
The financial sector remains stable while commercial bank liquidity continues to rise.
Financial sector indicators show that the banks are well capitalized and very liquid, and hence, have
strong protection against macro-financial risks (text table and Annex IV). Private sector credit growth
turned modestly positive in 2015, following two years of decline. Other financial indicators remain
strong, although profitability remains low with a 0.9 percent return on assets. Bank non-performing
loans (NPLs) declined to 10.6 percent of total loans, a trend that the CBB expects will continue over
the near-term. The most recent stress tests published by the CBB show bank capital-asset ratios to
be robust to a significant increase in NPLs. Given modest private sector credit demand, bank liquidity
continues to increase and commercial bank excess reserves in local currency rose by B$353 million in

2015. Bank exposure to government increased through holdings of Treasury Bills, partly offset by
reduced holdings of longer-term debentures.
Box 1. Implementation of 2015 Article IV Recommendations
Areas where there was progress in the following 2015 Article IV recommendations:


Contain current spending through further reductions in the wage bill and transfers.
o



Accelerate restructuring of public enterprises, including amalgamation or divestment.
o



While the wages and salaries bill (in percent of GDP) fell marginally in 2015/16, transfers
increased by an estimated 0.7 percent of GDP, partially due to an unbudgeted debt amortization
of one entity.

The authorities have set up a Monitoring Unit, and are reviewing the business plans of 15 large
state-owned enterprises (SOEs). However, progress in rationalizing and reining in spending has
been slow.

Continued to make progress in implementing several of the 2014 FSAP Update recommendations:
o

Legislative amendments to the CBB, FSC and Financial Institutions Act are being drafted or are
before Parliament; the strategic plan for Barbados Deposit Insurance Corporation (BDIC), and
discussions on a deposit insurance system for credit unions are continuing.

Areas where there was limited or no progress:


Establish a medium-term fiscal consolidation framework—with a debt anchor.
o



Review social spending to better target social programs.
o



No progress.

Cease central bank financing of the government and, if financing sources are not sufficient, allow
interest rates to rise to support the exchange rate peg.
o



No discernible progress.

Improve the quality of public services by reducing delays and inefficiency, and reviewing the impact of
labor market regulations on employment growth.
o



The government missed its 2015/2016 deficit target by a significant margin, and the central
government debt-to-GDP ratio continued to rise by an estimated 7.5 percentage points.

The CBB continues to be a major purchaser of government debt although it has allowed interest
rates to rise somewhat.

Shortcomings related to production and dissemination of data should be addressed before the next
Article IV consultation.

o

Despite ongoing TA, progress in improving data and resolving inconsistencies between real and
nominal GDP and the deflator has been slow.

8.
Monetary policy is driven by fiscal considerations. The CBB has continued to fund the
government through money creation as well as using commercial banks’ excess reserves. Direct
intervention by the CBB in the Treasury Bill (TB) auction in the 2015 pushed down interest rates,
although in the more recent auctions, the short-term rate rose to an average of about 3.4 percent,
from 2.8 percent in 2015. CBB purchases of TBs and debentures accounted for approximately twothirds of the increase in financing of the government in 2015.

9.
While the political situation remains stable, public frustration with weak growth and
fiscal adjustment is mounting. The Democratic Labour Party has been in power since 2008,
narrowly winning reelection in February 2013. Parliamentary elections are scheduled for 2018. There
are growing signs of frustration following multiple tax increases, a 10 percent government work force
reduction, and a wage freeze since 2009. Real wages are 11½ percent lower than in 2008. Labor
action is increasing, including a temporary closure of the port and airport in March 2016, and
demands for wage increases are becoming more pressing. Wage pressures are exacerbated by the
recent unwinding of a late 2013 10 percent voluntary wage cut for ministers and Parliamentary
Secretaries.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
10.
With debt rising and arrears mounting, the outlook is clouded. Growth is projected to
rise to 2.1 percent in 2016, reflecting higher private and public investment, mainly in refurbishing and
expanding the tourism stock, including the anticipated launch of two large hotel projects. While
growth should continue at around this pace in 2017, it is likely to taper off thereafter as tourism
plateaus and private and public investment is undermined by weak fiscal performance. In the
absence of a renewed reform effort, the fiscal outlook falls short of what is needed for sustainability.
Staff projects a deficit of 6.4 percent, based on the draft budget presented in March 2016, with a
primary surplus of 2 percent. Despite this improvement, central government debt would continue to
increase, reaching 114.2 percent in FY2021/22. In light of expected interest rates increases and low
credit ratings, debt service costs will rise, increasing funding challenges and putting pressure on the
exchange rate peg.
11.
Despite favorable trade developments, external reserves remain low. Low oil prices and
tourism inflows should further narrow the current account deficit from 6.7 percent of GDP in 2015 to
5.6 percent in 2016. Despite the improvement in the current account and increased official
disbursements (including a loan from China) reserves remain at about 2.9 months of imports at end2016. Although external debt is low and debt amortization is moderate, the level of reserves provides
limited room to maneuver in the event of a downside shock. Over the medium-term, the current
account balance is projected to deteriorate with the weakening in the terms of trade and reserves are
projected to decline.3 The recent Moody’s downgrade highlights growing risks.
12.
The external competitiveness assessment points to challenges. The currency is judged
moderately overvalued by approximately 5 to 10 percent. A cross-country comparison using global
indices indicates a decline in competitiveness while record tourism arrivals suggest that Barbados is

reestablishing its position as a prime Caribbean destination. Nevertheless, weak growth over the last
8 years, coupled with a slow recovery, point to serious challenges.
13.
While the financial system is sound, further deterioration of the fiscal situation could
put pressure on the system. Despite capital controls (which the authorities view as necessary to
support adequate reserve cover for the exchange rate peg), amplification of sovereign credit
concerns would put pressure on official reserves through current and/or capital account seepage.4
Moreover, a confidence crisis or real economy setback would reverse the decline in NPLS and would
weigh heavily on banks’ profitability. Banks do not carry large net open foreign exchange positions,
hence would not be directly exposed in case of a change in the exchange rate regime.
14.
Withdrawal of Correspondent Banking Relationships (CBRs), which is a concern in the
Caribbean, does not appear to have affected the domestic banks directly. All domestic banks are
foreign-owned, and their CBRs have been maintained.5 Nevertheless, banks have terminated
relationships of some IBFS corporate vehicles which could further depress growth prospects in the
offshore sector. The findings of the upcoming mutual evaluation by the Caribbean Financial Action
Task Force (CFATF) on AML/CFT could identify reforms that increase regulatory compliance costs for
IBFS entities.
15.
Other risks emanate from the external environment (see RAM, Annex I). Weak growth in
advanced economies, particularly the U.K., and spillovers from Brexit, could reverse the recent
improvement in arrivals and jeopardize domestic and foreign private investment in refurbishing and
expanding the tourism stock. The possible spread of the Zika virus could also undermine the tourism
recovery. A strong U.S. dollar could erode competitiveness and financial volatility could reduce FDI
and other capital flows, putting further pressure on the peg.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Policy options are limited. While the government has undertaken considerable adjustment measures in
the past few years, the deficit remains large while the debt keeps increasing, reflecting weak growth
and implementation shortfalls (Box 2). The authorities are committed to maintaining the exchange rate
peg and their strong record of timely debt service. In this context, policy discussions focused on reforms
to support the economic recovery, to reinvigorate fiscal consolidation, to reduce financing requirements
and reduce debt, and on measures to maintain financial stability and safeguard the currency peg.
Support a Nascent Economic Recovery

Key policy recommendations center on improving public sector services and
eliminating growth impediments. Priority should be placed on reforms to: (i) improve the delivery,
quality and cost effectiveness of public services; (ii) improve labor market efficiency; and (iii) enhance
agricultural sector polices. The World Bank’s Doing Business survey, the World Economic Forum

Box 2. Fiscal Adjustment Effort Over the Past Five Years
Recognizing the deterioration in public finances and rising debt, the government began implementing fiscal
reforms. Notwithstanding these efforts, the results have been mixed. These measures include:


A freeze on public sector wages since 2009.



An increase in the value added tax rate from 15 percent to 17.5 percent (initially introduced for 18
months) in December 2010, extended indefinitely in May 2012 (the VAT rate on tourism products was
reduced to 7.5 percent from 8.75 percent in September 2013).



In the 2013 Financial Statement and Budgetary Proposals:
 Commitment to a fiscal consolidation of 5.3 percent of GDP over the period September 2013–March
2015 (19 months), with two thirds of the adjustment to come from current expenditure cuts;
 In the medium term, the government targeted a fiscal deficit of 2.0 percent of GDP by 2020.



Public sector retrenchment was announced in December 2013:
 Roughly 3,000 public sector employees (about 11.5 percent of the total 26,000 employees in the
central government and statutory corporations) were to be laid off in two tranches, with the first
2,000 in January 2014, followed by 1,000 in March 2014;
 A further 500 public sector employees were to be downsized by attritions until 2018/19. This was to
have led to an estimated cut of 15 percent in public sector employment;
 High-ranking Government officials were to take a temporary ten per cent salary reduction;
 Wages and salaries were down by 8.2 percent in 2014/15 from 2012/13, somewhat short of
expectations. A savings of BD$72 million (0.8 percent of GDP) was realized, as compared to the
BD$140 million (1.6 percent of GDP) envisaged;



The 2015/16 June Budget statement:
 Introduced a host of tax measures drawing on the 2014 FAD review of taxation, that were to raise
BD$200 (2.3 percent of GDP) million in additional taxes and excise duties in the full fiscal year; these
included:

o

o
o
o
o

Removal of Group Relief and the reduction of the carry forward period for tax losses from nine
years to seven years with an anticipated increase in annual receipts by BD$19 million
(0.2 percent of GDP);
An increase in land tax rates designed to raise BD$44 million (0.5 percent of GDP);
Narrowing VAT exemptions (adjustment to the tax free food basket), imposition of the VAT on
betting and gambling (0.5 percent of GDP);
A new surcharge (higher VAT rate) on mobile telephone usage designed to raise BD$32.7
million (0.4 percent of GDP);

The government embarked on the reform of the Revenue Authority beginning April 2014 by establishing a
new semi-autonomous agency—the Barbados Revenue Authority (BRA), merging four government
departments aimed at improving tax collections efficiency, risk management and tax enforcement. Customs
and Excise Department was to be merged in April 2015, but is delayed. Delays in completing the reform and
in the implementation of a number of new tax measures has adversely affected 2015/16 tax performance.
The government undertook the reform of SOEs in 2014, with CARTAC support, to strengthen their finances
by improving corporate governance, strengthening internal control, and preparing financial statements. The
reform focused on the 15 largest enterprises, accounting for nearly 90 percent of government transfers in
FY2015/16, to permit their reduction over time. Progress has been slow, with more modest reduction in
transfers than planned, while at the same time there are reports of a significant increase in enterprise arrears.

(WEF) Global Competitiveness report, and the Tourism-WEF Report all point to impediments to
private sector growth, including public sector inefficiencies and delays caused by bureaucratic
hurdles. The perception of excessive government bureaucracy and red tape needs to be addressed
by concerted action to streamline processes and procedures, including by making more services
available online and making application requirements clearer. High priority should be placed on
facilitating permit issuance which is impeding investment, in some instances for extended periods,
which could slow the recovery. Efforts to reform the labor market should seek to increase flexibility
and boost productivity without unduly reducing worker protection. Collective labor agreements
include for example rigid rules limiting the permitted working hours, and legislation imposes lengthy
processes to permit dismissal, which raises costs and discourages employment. Government
involvement in helping to enhance employment opportunities should be practical and cost effective,
involving the business community and labor in the development of creative, low-cost solutions.
Agriculture is a potential source of growth, if it could strengthen its links to tourism through more
local product sourcing. While there is scope for the government to act as a facilitator in agricultural
initiatives, including through training and partnership with the private sector, public sector
involvement must be limited by overarching budget constraints.
Authorities’ views:


The authorities generally agreed with staff recommendations. They acknowledged that there was
room for improvement in the provision of public services, but questioned the accuracy of the
Doing Business Report, and noted, for example, that business licenses were typically granted in 3
days once supporting documentation was in order. They indicated that reforms are underway,
including enabling online filing, streamlining certain business legislation, and accelerating
registrations of businesses and licensing. Regarding Town and Country Planning building
permits, the authorities acknowledged instances of delay while noting that some could be
attributable to incomplete applications, such as the absence of an environmental impact
assessment, or zoning variance requests.

Resuscitate Fiscal Adjustment
17.
Additional adjustment is needed to stabilize debt and reduce funding requirements. To
place debt on a downward trajectory after an increase of 7.5 percent of GDP in FY2015/16, and to
address the funding challenges, staff recommended fiscal adjustment of at least 3.5 percent of GDP
over the next three years. Such adjustment would reduce debt below 100 percent by FY2019/20, ease
the funding burden, support international reserves, and improve the country’s credit ratings.
However, the government’s recent weak track record raises concerns as to whether there is adequate
implementation commitment or capacity. Currency depreciation, which the authorities reject, may
improve competitiveness and could allow for a somewhat less ambitious adjustment, although
substantial fiscal adjustment would still be required. Market-based debt operations are another
option, which could reduce funding requirements, but given the debt structure, the benefits of a
restructuring would be small and could have negative repercussions (see Appendix II).

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BARBADOS

18.
The proposed adjustment could temporarily inhibit growth, but would support higher
growth over the medium term. Notwithstanding the potential fiscal drag, a slower pace of fiscal
consolidation, in the absence of external funding, would entail significant risks. In this context, an
ambitious yet credible strategy may progressively improve business sentiment and increase private
investment, as well as ensure that the government has adequate resources for critical public
spending. These factors, together with early steps to tackle business impediments, could broadly
offset the negative short-term fiscal impulse while leading to higher medium term growth. Moreover,
fiscal reforms would support growth by reducing waste and duplication through a more efficient
public sector, rather than further cuts in employment and wages.

Adjustment should focus on renewing structural reform of the public sector and
significantly improving implementation, as well as measures to contain expenditure and raise
revenue. The fiscal deficit is projected to decline from 7.0 percent of GDP in FY2015/16 to
6.4 percent in FY2016/17 as a result of further increase in revenues reflecting the full year impact of
revenue measures put in place in June 2015, and lower transfers, largely the result of the government
not needing to make transfers to cover debt service (unexpected in FY2015/16) on behalf of
enterprises, as well as the continued reform to improve SOEs finances. Under the reform scenario,
the government would implement additional measures starting in FY2016/17 and improve



Completing and strengthening BRA reform. Establishment of the BRA and its merger with the
Customs and Excise Department (CED) has been ongoing since April 1, 2014 with the merger
now delayed from April 1, 2015 to July 1, 2016. Repeated delays, combined with periodic labor
action, have resulted in limited focus on risk management and tax enforcement. A new,

Deeper and comprehensive SOE reform. Transfers to SOEs increased from 9.8 percent of GDP
in 2005/06 to a peak of 14.4 percent in 2013/14. Reforms, which began in 2014 with the
assistance of CARTAC, focus on the 15 largest enterprises accounting for over 80 percent of
transfers. These reforms aim to improve corporate governance, strengthen internal control,
prepare financial statements, and provide the basis for reducing government transfers. Recent
debt service difficulties with one SOE highlight the need to improve SOE governance. A
comprehensive strategy is needed, including fundamental reconsideration of the size and form
of SOE-supported social programs, which should include:



providing stronger government leadership and policy direction in the reform of programs,
including in reducing the scope of services and increasing reliance on user charges
making SOE managers accountable for implementation of financial and restructuring plans
strengthening the SOE monitoring unit by increasing staffing and granting more authority
increasing the pace of consolidation, rationalization, and divestment of the 64 SOEs.6

Eliminate arrears. To contain and clear arrears, including tax refund arrears, the budget process
needs improvement, including by strengthening forecasting capabilities, imposing hard spending
ceilings, and strengthening SOE oversight.7 A comprehensive strategy for SOE management
should help reduce arrears accumulation resulting from lower budget transfers. Improved
internal controls, readjustment of business plans, and stronger corporate governance would
support this objective. A reduction in central government arrears to SOEs and the private sector
should improve their liquidity and trigger a broader reduction in arrears, as well as enhance
taxpayer ability to pay the BRA.

20.
Maintain NIS integrity. As in other Caribbean countries, Barbados’ NIS faces pressure from
population aging and slow growth. The NIS is well managed, with high contribution rates, ranging
from 17.75 to 21.35 percent, and coverage of about 90 percent of employed. The retirement age is
increasing to 67 years by January 1, 2018. Nevertheless, the weak employment growth in recent years
has led to a deterioration of the NIS financial position and expenditures began to exceed
contributions in 2013, rather than in 2024 as estimated in the 14th Actuarial Review, 8 and, since 2014,
the NIS has faced late contribution payments from the government and SOEs. The bulk of the
investment portfolio—74 percent—is held in government securities, well in excess of an earlier
suggested prudential limit of 54 percent and the agency’s target of 60 percent. Given high
contribution rates and the adjusted retirement age, there is limited scope to address future shortfalls
other than by reducing benefits. Replacement income is 60 percent (for low earners) and this would
need to be revisited if investment earnings and contributions fall below expenditure. Staff urged the
government to make contributions in a timely manner (rather than providing the equivalent in
debentures) to ensure that NIS has sufficient liquidity.
Authorities’ views:


6

They noted that the budget deficit in 2015/16 was higher than targeted due to increased
transfers as a result of debt service the government made on behalf of one entity, and several
foreign-financed investments that are represented as transfers. The latter include a high priority
project to upgrade ageing infrastructure in the water sector. Adjusting for these developments,
the authorities argued that they were much closer to their deficit target. More generally, they
emphasized that the foreign-financed capital projects should be accounted for differently.

There are about 200 public “agencies” including 64 SOEs.

The 2015 tax reforms eliminated a large number of zero-rated goods and services under the VAT as well as
abolished certain tax credits in PIT. This should reduce pressure for payment of tax refunds.



The authorities recognized the need for fiscal adjustment and were in broad agreement with
staff’s recommendations, acknowledging that fiscal adjustment is urgent in light of the funding
constraints and loss of international reserves. Nevertheless, in light of adjustment fatigue, it was
important to ensure broad stakeholder involvement, and they noted that legislative changes can
cause delays in implementation.



They agreed with the focus on SOE reform, and indicated that they plan to intensify their efforts
in this area, including by expanding the role of the private sector in providing some services.
Regarding health care financing, it was important to ensure that service quality is maintained,
and they were contemplating specific measures dedicated to funding the hospital. More
generally, they noted that an increase in user fees could increase cost of living, and could prompt
calls for wage increases. Moreover, while there is scope to streamline SOE activities and merge
entities, labor unions would have to be involved in the process.



A shortage of cash has led to tax arrears, which are exacerbated by the complex VAT structure
and associated refunds. To help reduce these arrears in the future, they are contemplating doing
away with all domestic zero-ratings. To reduce arrears, the authorities envisage a netting
operation of the interagency arrears, and offering government paper in lieu of cash settlement to
deal with suppliers’ arrears.

Maintain monetary and financial stability
21.
Monetary policy needs to be consistent with the exchange rate peg. The CBB should end
its direct financing of the government, including through direct purchases of government debt
through “recycling” of commercial banks’ excess reserves and by money creation. 9 Such purchases
risk an unsustainable expansion of the monetary base, depleting international reserves and over the
long run are incompatible with a fixed exchange rate,. constituting a significant macro-financial risk.
Moreover, the CBB should continue to allow domestic interest rates to increases in line with U.S.
rates, to reduce pressure on the peg.
22.
Continue close supervision of non-bank financial institutions. Credit unions have broad
membership, and, like the banks, faced loan quality deterioration (chiefly mortgages) and lower
profitability since the global financial crisis. Though NPLs remain high, despite some decline in 2015,
credit unions are not considered a source of systemic risk.10 In line with the 2014 FSAP Update
recommendations, staff underscored the need to move forward with improving onsite supervision
and regulation of the non-bank financial sector, and cross-border supervision of financial institutions.
The insurance sector, while large, has not been growing and profitability has been mixed.11 Most

insurance company investment is held domestically by statutory requirement, primarily in
government debt, also concentrating this sector’s exposure to the sovereign.
23.
The economically important International Business and Financial Services Sector (IBFS)
faces risks in light of heightened global concerns. Growth in the sector—which is second in
importance after tourism—has been stagnant since the onset of the global financial crisis because of
regulatory changes in other jurisdictions, mainly Canada, which is the source of much of Barbados’s
offshore business (Box 3). Withdrawal of CBRs, which has had broad repercussions in the Caribbean,
has not impacted domestic banks in Barbados, though a small number of IBFS entities have lost
CBRs. The prospects of further withdrawals of CBRs could depress growth in the sector. Furthermore,
correspondent banks and IBFS firms face increasing regulatory compliance costs under AML/CFT
regulations. The findings of the upcoming CFATF AML/CFT evaluation, beginning this summer and
expected to be completed in December 2016, could raise issues that increase costs. Against this
backdrop, financial sector regulators at the CBB and FSC should ensure close scrutiny of financial
intermediaries in the onshore and offshore sectors to support Barbados’ desire to project a strong
reputation as a transparent, efficient, and diverse financial center.
Authorities’ views:


The authorities acknowledged the increasing risks to macro-financial stability arising from
continued central bank financing of government. They were concerned about the adverse impact
of withdrawal of CBRs, particularly for the offshore sector, and indicated the need for a global
resolution to address the regulatory burden and reduce the externalities for small jurisdictions.

Other
24.
Data inadequacies complicate understanding of macroeconomic developments and
may lead to inadequate policies. As noted above, current and constant price-based GDP data
cannot be reconciled with available price information. The series have moved in different directions
since 2011. In addition, the current GDP series may not be a comprehensive measure of economic
activity, while inflation is consistently higher than in similar economies (see Selected Issues Paper).
Other concerns include the lack of adequate information on measuring tourism value added. While
adequate for surveillance, the data shortcomings increase difficulties establishing policy priorities
and monitoring outcomes. Staff stressed the urgency of addressing these shortcomings and urged
the authorities to obtain the support needed to resolve capacity problems.
Authorities’ views:


The authorities recognized data inadequacies, and took note of inconsistencies that have
emerged in recent years. They plan to complete the technical assistance program that is
underway and seek a long-term resident advisor to build capacity in this area on an ongoing
basis.

Box 3. International Business and Financial Services Sector Developments
The International Business and Financial Services sector (IBFS) in Barbados is the second largest, after tourism,
and was one of the most dynamic sectors driving growth. However, the global financial crisis and legislative
changes in Canada have adversely impacted the sector and its future prospects.
From 2001-2008, direct employment in the sector nearly doubled, from about 2000 to over 4000, the
majority of which were locals. The sector also became

While the global financial crisis reduced earnings and

would appear to be a key factor in the sector’s
stagnation in more recent years. Canadian companies
account for approximately 80 per cent of all the
business conducted in the IBFS. Hence, changes in
Canadian legislation have a particularly strong impact
on it. Two significant changes have occurred:

In 2007, Canada extended its favorable “exempt surplus” tax treatment of foreign affiliates in tax-treaty
countries to all jurisdictions that sign tax information exchange agreements (TIEAs). 1 Prior to this,
Barbados had been the main destination for Canadian business investment, but the changes made other
jurisdictions with lower or no taxes and an TIEA more attractive. In response, Barbados reduced its
taxation rates to remain competitive, lowering the top marginal tax rate on international business
companies from 3 percent to a range of rates from 0.25 percent to 2.5 percent in 2012 and 2013.



As of January 1, 2015, the Canadian government strengthened the integrity of exemption under its
foreign accrual property income regime to limit the erosion of its tax base, thereby reducing the benefit
of holding companies in Barbados and other favorable tax jurisdictions. This also impacted the trust
sector, which had been one of the island’s growth areas.

As a result of the Canadian legislative changes, combined with developments following the global financial
crisis, such as advanced economies’ concerns over tax compliance and increased scrutiny of offshore
banking centers in general, growth of the IBFS has been stagnant. Employment has remained relatively
stable since 2009 and the number of registered companies has remained at around 4 thousand. Moreover,
direct government revenues have significantly declined, from B$356 million in 2007 to B$ 97 million in 2013.
This represents a loss of about 3 percent of GDP.
Growth prospects remain clouded. While the sector continues to be the second most important, global
competition from other offshore jurisdictions, as well as efforts from advanced economies to reduce tax
arbitrage, remain challenges. Most recently, withdrawal of correspondent banking relationships, or more
broadly, “derisking” is creating new uncertainty. The government continues to support the industry,
including with its effort to sign double taxation agreements (18 since 2010), as well as to reform business
practices and legislation, to remain competitive.

STAFF APPRAISAL
25.
Economic activity is picking up after 7 years of stagnation. A surge in tourism arrivals
boosted growth to 0.8 percent in 2015 and growth should be about 2 percent this year and next if
the planned private and public investment programs go forward. Favorable terms of trade
developments have reversed consumer price inflation while narrowing the external current account
deficit.
26.
Despite renewed reform efforts, fiscal performance remains disappointing and
financing the deficit is challenging. After significant consolidation in 2014, the budget deficit has
been about 7 percent of GDP. Central government debt has been rising rapidly and now exceeds
100 percent of GDP. Rollover requirements are about 45 percent of GDP and new financing is largely
met by the central bank, the NIS, and arrears.
27.
Efforts are needed to support a nascent economic recovery. Priority should be placed on
improving public sector services and eliminating growth impediments, especially those related to
new tourism developments. Efforts to reform the labor market should seek increased flexibility and
productivity without unduly reducing worker protection. Agriculture is a potential source of growth,
particularly if underpinned by local product sourcing for the tourism sector. Labor market
interventions or agricultural initiatives should be practical and cost effective, involving the business
community and labor in the development of creative solutions against the backdrop of overarching
budget constraints.
28.
Concerted action is needed to reduce the fiscal deficit and bring down public debt. To
reverse last year’s 7.5 percent of GDP increase in public debt, fiscal adjustment of at least 3.5 percent
of GDP over three years is needed and greater consolidation would be warranted. This adjustment is
needed to ease the funding burden, support international reserves, and improve business sentiment.
While adjustment could temporarily inhibit growth, the negative fiscal impulse should be largely
offset by greater investor confidence, which could boost private sector investment.
29.
The adjustment strategy would focus on renewing structural reform in the public
sector and significantly improving implementation. This would require increased efforts to
monitor progress and enact corrective measures when progress falls short of target. It would require
improving capacity where needed and holding managers accountable for implementing proposed
reforms. It would be complemented by further measures to increase revenues and contain spending,
though the majority of fiscal savings should be the result of significant changes in the public sector
operations and the delivery of public services.
30.
In this context, urgent efforts are needed to revitalize revenue authority reform.
Merger of the revenue authority and customs service should be completed expeditiously and the
large taxpayers unit should be strengthened. Modernization is needed, including improved data
collection, verification, and sharing, supported by rapid implementation of a new IT system.

Accelerated adoption of effective risk management and enforcement strategies would also boost
revenue authority effectiveness.

Decisive steps are also necessary to reform state-owned enterprises. A deeper and more
comprehensive strategy is needed, including fundamental reconsideration of the size and form of
SOE-supported social programs. This could lead to the paring down of some public services and/or
the establishment of user fees. It is essentially that the large number of public entities and their
operating cost are reduced and made sustainable. Otherwise, their services must be either paid for
by higher taxes with adverse consequences for growth. Strong government leadership is critical,
underpinned by holding SOE managers accountable for implementation of financial and
restructuring plans. Divestment and consolidation of the large number of entities should also be a
priority. It would reduce the administrative burden of SOEs while possibly provide income that could
be used to reduce debt.
32.
Swift action is required to eliminate arrears. The continued increase in arrears inhibits
private sector operations and is impeding tax collections. The budget process needs to be improved
by strengthening cash forecasting capabilities, imposing hard spending ceilings that are revised if
revenue shortfalls occur, and strengthening SOE oversight. A reduction in arrears to SOEs and the
private sector should improve their liquidity and support their operations. In this connection, the
government should ensure its own prompt payment to the NIS.
33.
Monetary policy needs to be consistent with the exchange rate peg. Direct central bank
financing of the government is a significant macro-financial risk and is incompatible with a fixed
exchange rate. Interest rates need to adjust in line with U.S. rates to reduce pressure on the peg.
34.
While the financial system is stable, vigilance is warranted. Bank capital-asset ratios are
strong and stress testing indicates they are robust to a significant increase in NPLs. Credit unions
have broad membership and should be monitored closely in light of their importance to consumers.
Further efforts are needed to address FSAP Update AML/CFT recommendations and prepare for the
upcoming CFATF assessment.
35.
Improving the quality of data should be a priority. While data is adequate for
surveillance, large shortcomings complicate understanding of macroeconomic developments and
may lead to inadequate policies. Strengthening capacity and methodologies is critical to resolving
the large discrepancies between the current and constant-price based GDP, and improving the
measurement of inflation. This would also strengthen the timeliness and reliability of statistics.
36.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Barbados be held on the
standard 12-month cycle.

1/ The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the
view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” indicates
a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30 and 50 percent). The
RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually

Annex II. Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA)
Public debt sustainability risks remain elevated. Central government debt continued to rise rapidly,
increasing by 7.5 percent of GDP in FY2015/16 and now exceeds 100 percent of GDP. Public debt is
forecast under the baseline scenario to continue to grow to 114 percent of GDP in the medium term.
The financing needs generated under the baseline scenario are large and keep growing and, hence, the
debt-to-GDP ratio does not stabilize in the next 5 years. Gross financing needs are also very large, and
are forecast to significantly increase further over the medium term, reflecting the large magnitude of
short-term debt and limited appetite by the market for longer-term instruments. There are sizable
downside risks, including from low growth, continued significant recourse to short term debt, rising
arrears and contingent liabilities. The baseline debt path is vulnerable to unfavorable shocks from real
interest rates, real GDP growth, and the primary balance.

A. Public Debt Sustainability Analysis
Debt structure
1.
Barbados’ central government debt, excluding NIS nearly doubled from 53.9 percent of
GDP in FY2008/09 to 105.5 percent in FY2015/16. The definition of public debt used in this
assessment is central government gross debt, excluding government securities held by the NIS1 and
the stock of arrears.2 With the rapid increase in the debt, there has been an important change in its
structure, with an increase in the share of short-term debt from 10.3 percent in FY2008/09 to
36.6 percent in FY2015/16 while the share of debentures remained relatively constant. Domestic debt
grew to nearly ¾ of the total debt over the same period while the share of external debt decreased

Public debt obligations held by NIS are both assets and liabilities of the government, and are netted out under the
definition prescribed in the IMF public debt statistics manual (see: Public Sector Debt Statistics: Guide for Compliers
and Users, 2013). Including government securities held by the NIS, the debt stock increased from 72.8 percent of GDP
in FY2008/9 141.6 in FY2015/16.
1

Staff estimates central government arrears may amount to over 6 percent of GDP in FY2015/16; if accounted for in
the DSA analysis the stock of debt would be accordingly higher. The expenditure data is based on approved
expenditure, rather than paid, thus on an accrual basis.

despite increasing by 96.4 percent since FY2008/09. Central Bank of Barbados holdings of
government debt reached 12.2 percent in FY2015/16 reflecting increased monetization of the debt.

Potential gains from a market debt
restructuring appear limited. Barbados has an
impeccable debt service record which it is
committed to maintaining. While a market-based
restructuring exercise could be useful to shift the
composition of the debt to longer term maturities
(and reduce the rollover risk), given the steeply
sloping yield curve, this would necessarily imply a
large increase in debt service costs.3

3.
The baseline scenario incorporates the draft FY2016/17 budget proposals with some
modification based on recent developments and ongoing government reform effort. The
specific assumptions are as follows:
Growth and Inflation: Growth is projected to increase to about 2 percent in 2016 and continue at
this pace over the medium-term, based on evidence of a pickup in private and public investment,
with the former primarily in the tourism stock, in response to record stay-over arrivals in 2015. The
public investment would be undertaken by SOE and is not reflected in central government accounts.
Inflation is projected to pick up to an average of 2.2 percent reflecting changes in the terms of trade.
The fiscal multiplier is assumed to be zero. The high debt-to-GDP ratio is inhibiting private
investment due to concerns about sustainability. In this context, credible fiscal consolidation is likely
to increase confidence and increase private sector investment, counterbalancing the negative impact
on growth from fiscal consolidation.
Fiscal Balance: The fiscal balance for FY2016/17 is forecast to be 6.4 percent of GDP and a primary
balance of 2 percent, based on the Government’s FY2016/17 draft budget, with some modifications;
higher revenues forecast is based on an expected full implementation of FY2015/16 fiscal measures
and improvement in revenue collections and lower capital spending is based on the constraints on
government funding. Over the medium term, the fiscal balance deteriorates to a deficit of
7.6 percent, on account of higher debt service costs related to higher debt and higher interest rates.
The primary balance improves to a surplus of 2.6 percent of GDP based on the assumption of higher
revenue (as explained above) and some reversal of the rapid increase in spending on goods and
services (a return to the recent average) and the implementation of the government’s plans to
reduce transfers to SOEs in line with their ongoing reform program.
Financing: Financing requirements are primarily being met by new short-term debt instruments,
with the share of short-term debt in new domestic debt increasing from 80 to 88 percent by
FY2021/22; all short-term debt is rolled over. External debt is based on available information on

government plans to borrow from multilaterals and bilateral entities, based on plans in the pipeline
(following consultations with MDBs and donors). Assumptions on interest cost are:


Interest rate on external debt: US LIBOR (6M) plus spread (1.5pp) – 4 percent on average; all
external debt is treated as one debt instrument, with 5 years grace and 20 years maturity



Interest rate on domestic long term: 10-year T Note rate plus spread (4pp) – 7.1 percent on
average in medium term; all long term debt is treated as one instrument with a 10 years grace
and a bullet repayment



Interest rate on domestic short term: – 3-month T bill rate plus spread (3pp) – 4.9 percent on
average in medium term; all short term debt is treated as one debt instrument

The assumption is that there are foreign privatization receipts of B$160 million in FY2016/17 from
the sale of Barbados National Oil Terminal Company.

Medium-Term Debt Sustainability Analysis
4.
The public debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to rise from 106 percent in FY2016/17 to
114.2 percent in FY2021/22. Public debt dynamics are driven by a modest primary surplus of
2 percent in FY2016/17, expected to remain nearly flat in the medium term, and a high interest debt
service bill. The estimated debt-stabilizing primary balance in 2016/17 would be 5.8 percent. This is

weakness in implementation has led
to continued increase in debt and higher vulnerabilities.
5.
Risks are significant. Gross financing needs, comprised mostly of short-term debt rollover,
would grow from 44 percent of GDP in FY2016/17 to 55 percent by FY2021/22. Rolling over this debt
constitutes an important risk. Other significant risks are: (i) higher-than-expected increases in U.S.
and domestic interest rates; and (ii) recognition of contingent liabilities and arrears, which are
38

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BARBADOS

sizeable. Furthermore, the National Insurance Scheme (NIS) capacity to absorb more government
debt may be limited by its operational and investment surpluses which are projected to decline over
time, and by prudential limits regarding asset concentration. Most importantly, the central bank has
limited scope to finance the government given the fixed exchange rate regime, its ability to continue
sterilizing the impact of monetization of the deficit indefinitely, and the level of reserves.
6.
The heat map highlights significant risks to the debt profile, namely the rapid increase
in short-term debt. That this debt is mostly held domestically helps to mitigate the risks from
external shocks. Nevertheless, the high proportion of short-term domestic debt makes Barbados very
vulnerable to an increase in domestic interest rates.
7.
The stress test scenarios confirm the high vulnerability of debt and financing needs to
shocks to real interest rates, real GDP growth. Shocks to real interest rates push the debt-to-GDP
ratio to about 131 percent, and shocks to real GDP growth to 123 percent by FY2021/22. Gross
financing needs remain elevated at about 44 to 68 percent of GDP under these shocks, with the real
interest rates shock having the most adverse impact. Shocks to the primary balance are moderate –
they would push nominal debt to 117 percent of GDP and increase gross financing needs to
56 percent of GDP. Shocks to the exchange rate would worsen the debt path only marginally.
8.
Staff projections of GDP growth, the primary balance, and inflation have on average
been overoptimistic. This reflects the unexpectedly prolonged nature of the economic crisis in
Barbados, with an extended period dating back to 2008 of negative to stagnant growth and the
inability of the authorities to implement their planned reform. Current base line projections envisage
a mild recovery, which would by definition result in higher growth than the ten-year average.
Typically, after a prolonged recession growth would be higher as a catch up. The staff projections do
not envisage such a scenario, but rather a return to more steady, but still relatively low growth. The
“Boom-Bust” analysis does not apply to Barbados, because Barbados in experiencing weak growth.

B. External Debt
9.
External public debt is relatively
low and does not in itself pose solvency
risks. However, there are vulnerabilities in the
medium term arising from the liquidity needs
related to a possible deterioration in market
perception as a result of further downgrading
of their sovereign rating. This could make
future access to external financing difficult
and could reduce the probability of rollover
of existing debt and increase its costs
substantially. Lack of data on external private
debt prevents a full quantitative assessment
of the economy’s external position.

Source: Fund staff calculations.
1/ Public sector is defined as central government, excluding NIS holdings. Fiscal year (April to March) data.
2/ Based on available data.
3/ Long-term bond spread over U.S. bonds.
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year.
5/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as ae(1+r).
8/ Includes asset changes and interest revenues (if any). For projections, includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Annex III. External Sector Assessment, Competitiveness, and
Reserve Adequacy
The Barbados dollar remains moderately overvalued although the improvement in the terms of trade
have narrowed the gap with fundamentals. The EBA-lite assessment (current account, equilibrium
exchange rate and external sustainability) point to an overvaluation of about 5-10 percent.
Nonetheless, these quantitative approaches face a number of shortcomings, due in part to the lack of
consistent data (i.e., on net foreign assets (NFA) and terms of trade).1 Qualitative measures using
global indices imply that competitiveness may have weakened but the strong tourism performance
may indicate an improvement in competitiveness. Reserves are broadly adequate, but staff estimates
suggest they are below the level considered comfortable for a small island economy with a fixed
exchange rate.
External Balance Assessment: EBA-Lite methodology
1.
The EBA-Lite current account methodology suggests that the exchange rate is
overvalued by 4.8 percent. This is based on an estimated cyclically adjusted current account
balance and norm of 5.4 percent and 4.1 percent, respectively. The gap between the cyclically
adjusted actual and the norm current account is relatively small (about 1.3 percent). There are some
policy gaps, mostly

Owing to the lack of consistent data on NFA, cumulative CA deficits are used as a proxy for NFA.

3.
The EBA-lite external sustainability
analysis also suggests that the Barbados dollar
may be slightly overvalued. 3 Specifically, the
analysis points to an overvaluation at about
9.6 percent. For Barbados to stabilize its NFA, it
would have to maintain its CA deficit at about
5 percent of GDP. Given the structure of the
balance of payments, this would require stronger
exports of goods and services, suggesting the need
for policies to improve competitiveness.

Qualitative indicators raise some questions about competitiveness. According to the
Global Competitiveness Index and the Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index (Figure 7),
Barbados’ ranking declined from 47th to 55th position and from 27th to 46th position, respectively
between 2013/2014 and 2014/15 and 2013 to 2015, respectively relative to other economies.
However, tourism data provide a conflicting picture with arrivals suggesting an increase in tourism
market share –with Barbados receiving the largest increase in stay-over visitors in the Caribbean,
after Cuba and Aruba.4 Visitor expenditure picked up at a slower pace. The improved tourism
performance in 2015 is partly attributable to a recovery in key markets (including the UK), entrance
of a well-known tourism chain (including Sandals Resorts International), increased airlift, and a
strengthened marketing effort.
5.
There have been several recent initiatives to enhance tourism competitiveness
including the creation of two agencies. The Barbados Tourism Marketing Inc. (BTMI) and
Barbados Tourism Product Authority (BTPA) were established in September 2014 to replace the
Barbados Tourism Authority. BTMI is tasked with marketing the country while BTPA focuses on the
development of Barbados tourism attractions and infrastructure. BTMI has focused on innovative
approaches to increase airlift and building “strong alliances” with travel agencies, tour operators and
local partners to increase Barbados marketing presence. The BTMI and Barbados Hotel & Tourism
Association (BHTA) launched “Brilliant Barbados”, a promotion aimed at increasing forward booking
for the softer summer and fall periods, with value-packed deals. Ongoing initiatives include
updating visitor accommodation regulations to internationally-recognized visitor short-term
accommodation standards—to ensure that Barbados product remains globally competitive in an
evolving tourism product market. Other initiatives include a “Mystery Shopper Programme” for
Visitor Accommodation, Tourism Services and Service Providers to objectively assess the amenities
and services comprising Barbados’ Tourism Product. This Programme will provide valuable feedback
to all Tourism Service Providers and enhance product quality offerings and tourism services.
6.
Despite the surge in tourism arrivals, travel receipts and GDP impact remain low. There
is scope to enhance earnings from tourism. An IMF study (“Revisiting Tourism Flows to the

Caribbean: What is driving arrivals” WP/14/229) points to the need for structural reforms to raise
product quality, and reduce cost in destinations like Barbados. Efforts to integrate sectors, including
agriculture supply chains, with tourism would be beneficial. Additional reforms are needed to
safeguard the “brand” and ensure longer-term competitiveness. These include incentives for
investment in the tourism human capital stock (including through better skills matching and
training).
7.
Reserve Adequacy Assessment The reserve position is expected to improve slightly in 2016
mainly on account of a further decline in the current account deficit, reflecting low commodity
prices and an increase in official borrowing, (including a loan from the Export-Import Bank of China)
from 2.8 to 3.1 months of prospective imports. Reserves are assessed to be adequate based on
several metrics. Reserves exceed the short-term external debt by a substantial margin and are
somewhat higher than the threshold

Annex IV. Risks to Financial Stability in Barbados
1.
This annex assesses risks to Barbados’ financial stability using the country financial
stability map methodology, and a credit cycle and financial soundness indicators heat map.1
Financial stability methodology maps quantitative indicators into six categories of risks and
conditions relevant for financial stability: (i) macroeconomic risks, (ii) inward spillover risks, (iii) credit
risks, (iv) market and liquidity risks, (iv) monetary and financial conditions, and (vi) risk appetite.
Domestic and external sources of risks to financial stability and their evolution over the past year
(since the Staff Report for the 2015 Article IV Consultation) are evaluated and compared against
developments in global risks to financial stability from the Global Financial Stability Report.

2.
Macroeconomic and credit risk indicators have declined slightly over the past
eighteen months, but remain above the normalized historical average, based on a diffusion of
indicators. Although economic growth has turned positive, high unemployment, low growth, and
fiscal deficits contribute to the overall macroeconomic risks. Banks’ non-performing loan ratios have
been slowly dropping and bank profitability (ROA and ROE) has increased, contributing to a minor
improvement in the credit risk measure, though as shown in the aggregate time series chart below,
credit risk is above the recent historical average. The tepid turnaround in private sector credit
growth in 2015, combined with banks’ very liquid balance sheets and low exposure to foreign
liabilities, combine to limit market and liquidity risks. Trade and financial linkages and the erosion of
international reserves has increased inward spillover risks. Growth of broad money and domestic
credit are the key elements behind the slight easing of the monetary and financial conditions metric.

Financial stability maps follow the methodology of Cervantes, Jeasukul, Maloney and Ong (2014), “Mapping
Country to Global Financial Stability,” IMF Working Paper, 2014. The FSI heat map is based on methodology
stemming from Chapter 3 of the “Global Financial Stability Report” IMF, September 2011.

Barbados’ well-developed financial system is dominated by strongly capitalized
and highly liquid foreign commercial banks. The Financial Soundness Indicator “Heat Map”
(below) shows little immediate risks to the banks. Liquidity is extremely high, in part, reflecting weak
economic performance and slow private sector credit growth for most of the past decade. As a
result, the credit cycle does not generate any red or yellow cautionary flags. Banks’ holdings of
government treasury bills and debentures are about 15 percent of their total assets. As noted,
profitability indicators (ROA and ROE), while low by historical standards, are beginning to increase.
The NPL ratio is very high (10.6 percent in 2015Q4), but has been slowly declining. Banks’ average
leverage ratio is stable, and close to the range for advanced economies with highly developed
banking systems, including Canada, but falls within the template’s medium vulnerability threshold
range.

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
(As of May 10, 2016)
Barbados graduated from World Bank financing in 1993, but has continued to borrow in the area of
HIV/AIDS on an exceptional basis. The World Bank has been providing technical and financial
assistance in the area of HIV/AIDS to Barbados since 2001. The Caribbean HIV/AIDS I-Barbados
Project, which closed in 2007, achieved high levels of awareness, treatment, and care, but was less
successful in inducing the level of sustained behavior change required to affect the epidemic's
prevention and control.
Given the success of the first project and the remaining unfinished work, the Government of
Barbados (GOB) requested a follow-on project to contribute to tackling the outstanding challenges.
The US$35 million World Bank second loan, approved in August 2008, supported the
implementation of the National Strategic Plan for HIV Prevention and Control 2008–2013 (NSP),
specifically to increase: (i) adoption of safe behaviors, in particular amongst key populations at higher
risk; (ii) access to prevention, treatment and social care, in particular for key populations at higher
risk; (iii) capacity of organizational and institutional structures that govern the National Aids Program;
and (iv) use of quality data for problem identification, strategy definition and measuring results. This
project closed in November 2014. The GOB requested the loan in part to ensure sustainability and
commitment of funding to the National HIV/AIDS Program while improving accountability and multisectoral coordination of the Program. Due to the country’s graduated status, Bank assistance was
justified in the context of the public goods nature of support to HIV/AIDS prevention and
control. The Bank was the only source of external funding, as other sources such as the Global Fund
against AIDS, TB and Malaria targeted lower-income countries.

2016 Lending Program
A new Country Strategy for Barbados 2015-2018 was approved in June 2015. The focus is on
supporting private sector competitiveness and enhancing efficiency in service delivery, while
addressing binding constraints to growth in the following sectors: (i) Tourism; (ii) Transportation and
Logistics; (iii) Energy; and (iv) Integrated Coastal Zone Management and Climate Resilience. There are
two loans in the pipeline for approval in 2016: (i) National Tourism Program for a total of
US$10 million; and (ii) Deployment of Cleaner Fuels & Renewable energies in Barbados for a total of
US$24 million.
Net Cash Flow
Over the past decade, Barbados experienced a negative net cash flow that averaged US$15 million
during 2004-08. During 2009-11, policy-based loans led the rise in disbursements and the positive
net cash flow that peaked at US$54.3 million in 2011. After 2013, these remained positive and are
expected to decline in 2016.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of June 28, 2016)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is deemed to be broadly adequate for surveillance despite shortcomings
in GDP at constant and current prices, consumer prices, financial reporting by public enterprises
(statutory bodies) and discrepancies on external sector data (net foreign assets), including
international investment position (IIP). These data shortcomings are due to weak capacity, which
hampers the provision of and/or affects the reliability of certain data. IMF experts, mainly from
CARTAC, are providing TA to help improve Barbados’ statistical capacity in these areas. Barbados
has been participating in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) since May 2000 and
currently participates in its successor initiative, the enhanced GDDS.
National Accounts: At present, the Barbados Statistical Services (BSS) compiles GDP at current
prices according to the 1993 system of national accounts (see paragraph 39 and Annex I of the
Staff Report). GDP at constant prices (real) is compiled by the Central Bank of Barbados (CBB) on
an annual basis, which it needs for analytical and operational purposes. CBB estimates use the
production approach at a highly aggregated level with partial data and an outdated 1974 base
year. Given these limitations, Fund experts determined that these estimates should be viewed as
“projections” rather than statistics. Neither agency publishes an estimate of a GDP deflator. These
series have moved in different directions since 2011 and cannot be reconciled with available price
information (CPI).
IMF experts are supporting the BSS in the production of a constant price series and have identified
a few resource gaps in the production of quarterly real and nominal GDP estimates. The BSS has
committed to disseminate the annual real GDP estimates and the quarterly nominal and real GDP
by October 2016; staff urged the authorities to move production of both series officially to the BSS
after it is able to address the data inconsistency issues.
The BSS is finalizing preparation of the constant price series by industry. In an effort to improve
source data, the BSS will continue to utilize administrative data for the generation of economic
indicators. The BSS plans to develop quarterly constant price estimates by industry. As a medium
term goal, the BSS should construct GDP by expenditure, both quarterly and annually.
Price Statistics: The BSS, with support from CARTAC, published producer price indexes (PPI),
including 27 industries and 68 establishments that represent 80 percent of manufacturing output,
and export and import price indices. However, the output was hampered by weaknesses in the
survey and processing issues and recent number raise significant questions about their reliability.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

9

BARBADOS

Despite recent initiatives to update the consumer price index and the index of industrial
production, potential misalignments in real estate prices are not addressed due to the absence of
a systematic index of property prices. The consumer price index uses an expenditure basket for
1998–99 for its July 2001=100 series introduced in January 2002. The BSS is currently working
towards a new index of industrial production with base year 2014.
Government Finance Statistics: Fairly comprehensive and up-to-date above-the-line data are
available for central government budgetary accounts, but government transfers are reported with
a lag. The authorities have reported for the GFSY 2015 edition, but the most recent year data
provided is 2013. As a result of the incomplete coverage of off-budget transactions, a discrepancy
exists between the overall balance and financing data in some years. Public enterprises (PEs) and
other statutory bodies have not submitted financial reports for several years, with some dating
back to 2007 or 2009. They submit estimates in the budget process through line ministries, but
accounting is generally not provided on outturns. The authorities are increasing resources at the
Ministry of Finance (MoF) to monitor performance of the largest PEs and there has been an
increase in compliance but much more work is still needed.
Information on central government arrears has improved, but a more comprehensive measure is
needed that includes general government and the Barbados Revenue Agency. Financial sector
data on public sector net domestic borrowing usually cannot be fully reconciled with above-theline fiscal data, partly because of limited availability of nonbank financial sector information. This
includes contracting of liabilities by PEs. This reduces the degree of certainty about the actual fiscal
position as well as contingent liabilities of the state. The authorities introduced accrual accounting
of public finance in April 2007 though further refinements are underway.
Data on public sector debt is based on end-March 2016 data, received from the Debt
Management Unit at the MoF. The CBB also presents debt data which differs from data provided
by MoF for several reasons, including the timing of recording of payments and disbursements and
the use of different sources in some cases such as domestic loan data. Staff practice has been to
use data provided by one source—the MoF. STA has not received any request from the authorities
for TA in government finance statistics in recent years.
Monetary and Financial Statistics: Monetary data are available on the CBB website, however,
these data have not been reported to STA nor published in IFS since May 2012. The monetary
survey uses only central bank and commercial bank data. The February 2009 and May 2013 STA
missions recommended expanding the coverage to include data for other deposit taking
institutions and the three largest credit unions. However, this recommendation has not yet been
implemented. As a result, actual monetary data are under-estimated. Interest rate data (e.g., T-bill
rate, various deposit and lending rates) are available on the CBB website.
Financial sector surveillance: The CBB and FSC publish financial stability reports, which analyze a
range of financial soundness indicators (FSIs) for commercial banks and other financial institutions.
Authorities compile FSIs for their own use but do not report them to STA.

10 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BARBADOS

External sector statistics: The authorities are making efforts to provide more comprehensive
quarterly estimates of balance of payments data, which is hampered by lags in the compilation of
data on trade in services, and incomplete information on the activities of the offshore sector. In
addition, lack of data on external private debt prevents a full quantitative assessment of the
economy’s external position. The quality of the current and capital account estimates needs to be
improved, based on the sometimes large errors and omissions needed to balance the accounts.
The tourism receipts numbers may also not provide a comprehensive report on tourism spending.
It is based on survey data from the CTO, but it is not clear whether spending by tourist using
Airbnb and similar online service providers are adequately captured. Barbados provides estimates
of its IIP with a lag; however, these data do not appear to be consistent with balance of payment
data. The CBB should continue to draw on available CARTAC assistance to reconcile IIP data with
the balance of payments. Data on official reserve assets, which are not disseminated on a timely
basis nor according to a fixed schedule, should be circulated on a monthly basis within one to four
weeks after the end of the reference month.
II. Data Standards and Quality
The country is a GDDS participant. However, most of its metadata, with the exception of the real
sector and socio-demographic metadata, have not been updated since October 2002. At the
authorities’ request, STA has conducted an SDDS assessment, providing a draft action plan that
could lead to SDDS subscription.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on Barbados
August 22, 2016
1.
This statement reports on information that has become available since the staff report was
issued. It does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal, in particular the need for renewed fiscal
reform effort.
2.
Economic developments since the Article IV mission have been mixed. The Central
Bank reported that growth in the first six months of 2016 was 1.3 percent and lowered its
projection for the year to 1.5 percent, reflecting the first half-year performance, a delay of a large
tourism investment project, slower growth of tourism arrivals, and concerns about Brexit.
Notwithstanding, the unemployment rate declined sharply from 10.2 percent in 2015Q4 to 9.3
percent for the 2016Q1. Growth in tourism arrivals slowed to 5.3 percent compared to 14.7 in the
first half of 2015. Producer prices are down 3 percent from May 2015 while the CPI fell by 1.4
percent by end-March.
3.
External developments generally remain positive, but international reserves have
fallen further. Lower fuel prices, a recovery in merchandise exports, and continued growth in
tourism receipts have further improved the current account position relative to the first half of
2015. In addition, long-term private capital inflows have increased. However, as a result of
official debt service and short-term outflows, reserves fell by US$21.5 million to
US$441.9 million, compared with Staff’s revised end-2016 estimate of US$ 458 million, or
about 3 months of imports).
4.
Regarding fiscal developments, government finances are deteriorating and funding
challenges have intensified. The Central Bank reported the deficit in the first quarter of
FY2016/17 (April to June) increased by about 0.25 percent of GDP, mainly on account of lower
revenues. Non-interest expenditures declined broadly offsetting the lower revenues, but interest
cost were higher. The Central Bank has had to significantly increase its funding of the
government as commercial banks reduced their lending, including by reducing the amount they
rolled over. About two-thirds of this funding came from the CBB on-lending commercial banks’
excess reserves, and a third reflected the creation of new money.
5.
The authorities presented new budgetary proposals on August 16th. These measures
are intended to reduce the cash deficit by about 1.8 percent this year and to continue the
consolidation in the coming years, to bring the deficit to about 2.5 percent in 2018—the
government’s medium-term real growth target. The main measures include a new social
responsibility levy on imports, to help pay for medical costs and support an improved sanitation
program, an increase in the bank asset tax from 0.2 percent to 0.35 percent, and a tax amnesty.
On the expenditure side, the budget targets reducing spending by about 0.6 percent of GDP
through increased efficiencies and continued reduction in transfers to public enterprises. The
budget also noted that there would be no new capital controls. Privatization, new tourist projects,
and accelerated drawdown from development banks are expected to increase international

2
reserves to over US$500 million in the coming months. The budget reiterated the government’s
commitment to meet its debt service obligations but noted that it will develop a refinancing plan
for the state enterprises to better manage the government’s contingent liabilities. The budget also
provided for increased tax exemptions for certain tourist developments.
6.
The staff appraisal remains appropriate. The staff welcomes the government’s
commitment to continue fiscal consolidation although the further increase in tax exemptions
could erode the revenue performance. Developments in the first half of the year, mainly delayed
investment, slower tourism arrivals, and Brexit, are likely to reduce growth to below 2.0 percent
in 2016 and 2017. Nevertheless, the budgetary measures should more than offset the effect of
weaker growth on the debt profile—assuming full implementation on a timely basis. However,
more may need to be done to stabilize the debt over the medium term, particularly if growth fails
to pick up as envisaged by the authorities. Staff’s key points on the need to support the economic
recovery, renew the reform effort, and reduce the fiscal deficit and bring down public debt
remain valid.

Statement by Michael McGrath, Alternate Executive Director for Barbados
and Lorie Zorn, Senior Advisor
August 22, 2016
Our Barbadian authorities thank staff for their frank and comprehensive assessment of the
challenges facing the Barbados economy. There is broad agreement on the thrust of the staff
report, including the areas that need to be addressed and the policy proposals. However, our
authorities have some differences of view from staff in light of the past several years of fiscal
consolidation and the need to maintain social consensus.
Economic Overview
The economic recovery in Barbados has continued to strengthen, and the effects of multiple
shocks experienced since the great financial crisis have started to dissipate. Real GDP grew by
almost 1 percent in 2015 – the highest rate of growth since 2007 – and the pace has increased
into 2016. Between January and June, the economy grew by 1.3 percent compared to virtually no
growth over the same period in 2015.
The solid increase in tourism activity has supported the economic recovery. Tourist arrivals grew
by about 14 percent over 2015 and have continued to grow this year, although at a slower, but
still healthy, rate of 5 percent. The financial services sector, which contributes to almost one
quarter of GDP has also maintained its small but steady pick-up. These developments have
helped to increase employment while bringing down the unemployment rate from an average of
12.5 percent in the latter half of 2014 to an average of 11.5 percent in the latter half of 2015.
Unemployment has continued to fall, reaching an average of 9.3 percent over the first quarter of
2016.
The Barbadian authorities forecast economic growth of 1.5 percent in 2016, which indicates a
slower pace for the remainder of this year owing to expected delays in major tourism and other
commercial investment projects. The main impact on growth of the recent fall in the value of the
pound sterling may be a reduction in real estate sales to U.K. residents, but the growth rate could
be higher if investment in tourism and alternative energy can be sped up. Inflation, which is
mainly imported via fuel and commodity prices, has continued to decline further into negative
territory.
Despite the strength in tourism, which has contributed to a narrowing in the current account
deficit, a decline in private investment plus higher external debt service requirements have
resulted in a decline in foreign exchange reserves of approximately BDS$168 million (USD 84
million), since the end of 2014. This translates into a decline of about 1 week of import cover,
i.e., 14.7 weeks at end-2014 to 13.5 weeks at end-June 2016. Even so, the loss of reserves from
January to June was about half as large as that experienced in the first six months of 2015. In
addition, private foreign inflows for known investment projects, mostly related to hotel
development, plus a tightening in foreign exchange outflows related to recently announced

2
budget measures are expected to restore the stock of reserves to approximately BDS$938 million
(USD 470 million), equivalent to about 14 weeks of import cover, by the end of this year. While
this level of foreign reserves is viewed by the Barbadian authorities as adequate to protect the
value of the Barbados currency, they also agree with staff that there is little margin for maneuver
in the event of a downside shock. The goal over a longer period is to restore reserves to a more
comfortable level that is closer to 18 weeks of import cover. Achieving this objective will require
a reduction in public sector spending alongside an increase in economic activity.
Fiscal performance in 2015-16 continued to register improvement. The publically-announced
target deficit of 4.5 percent, which is calculated on an accrual basis to ensure full accountability
and transparency within the public sector, was achieved despite delays in investment projects and
slow implementation of certain 2015 budget measures. This compares to a deficit of 5.0 percent
(on an accrual basis) in 2014-15. However, on a cash basis, lower-than-expected growth in tax
revenues plus higher-than expected capital transfers resulted in a cash deficit that was greater
than originally anticipated. With the exception of two tax measures, all of the June 2015 policy
changes now have been fully implemented. Furthermore, in recognition of the seriousness of the
fiscal situation and the need to maintain credibility in the government’s commitment to fiscal
rationalization and a sustained economic recovery, additional actions have been announced in the
August Budget and Financial Statement (BFS). Nonetheless, a further increase in the gross
government debt-to-GDP ratio is implied in the near term. Although the Barbadian authorities
agree that the overall level of government debt is too high, they are of the view that debt is
sustainable in the short term, predicated on the low concentration of foreign debt – foreign debt
service accounts for only 8 percent of balance-of-payment current account credits. Appropriate
policy actions will contain and eventually reverse the debt ratio in the longer term.
Fiscal Policy Agenda
In response to the high deficit of 11 percent in the fiscal year 2013-14, the Barbados government
committed to a program of extensive fiscal consolidation which saw subsequent (cash) deficits
decline to approximately 7 percent of GDP in 2014-15 and 2015-16. While this necessarily
imposed some sacrifice on the Barbadian people during this period, social cohesion has been
maintained.
The Barbadian authorities remain committed to fiscal adjustment and public sector reforms
so that the fiscal deficit is reduced below the rate of economic growth in the near term and is in
balance by 2020. Work continues, with the aid of technical assistance, towards a fiscal
responsibility law. In the meantime, numerous tax measures have been introduced and the
contingent of public sector employees has been reduced in order to increase tax revenues and
reduce public expenditures respectively. These measures have only recently started to bear fruit.
The August BFS outlined additional adjustments in support of fiscal consolidation:



Effective September 1, 2016, a National Social Responsibility Levy at a rate of 2 percent
on all imports into Barbados (except goods for manufacturing, agriculture and tourism) to
assist in offsetting the costs of financing public health care service provision in Barbados.
Effective April 1, 2016, the Bank Asset Tax will increase from the current rate of 0.2
percent to 0.35 percent.
An amnesty on interests and penalties on taxes owed across the tax categories of VAT,
Income, and Land taxes will be granted from September 15, 2016 to February 15, 2017 if
the full balance of the principal is paid within this time frame.
BDS$50 million in approved expenditure will be cut across all ministries in the 2016-17
fiscal year.

At the same time, a program of comprehensive public sector structural reforms will continue
to complement these measures. This includes restructuring public enterprises through improved
governance and financial management practices, and through mergers and eliminations to
increase efficiency in the delivery of high-quality services. A key example is the centralized
Barbados Revenue Authority, which has now been fully established to oversee and enforce the
collection of all taxes and excise duties. With the aid of a new, common IT system, the
amalgamated entity will streamline operations and help to increase tax compliance and reduce
tax refund arrears. The government will also soon unveil proposals for mergers involving the
National Housing Corporation, as well as other organizations with mandates related to tourism,
sports, and the delivery of social goods. However, necessary consultations with labor unions and
other stakeholders imply that the decision process will not be completed before the end of this
year. More generally, public financial management will continue to improve with planned
enhancements to the government procurement system in the areas of a stronger legal framework,
enhanced procurement operations, and governance. Legislation for the regulation and control of
public procurement is well advanced and should be brought before Parliament before year end.
The authorities acknowledge that financing the deficit is challenging but manageable.
Commercial banks increased their holdings of government debt by more than BDS$150 million
over the 2015-16 fiscal year. As outlined in the staff report, the Central Bank of Barbados also
contributed to meeting the government’s financing requirement by recycling BDS$238 million
of surplus funds – excess commercial bank reserves on deposit at the central bank – and
providing BDS$190 million in new financing. Given the still low demand for credit by the
private sector and the time needed for fiscal reforms to take effect, the authorities believe this
temporary central bank support is necessary to help provide stability during the transition.
Central bank credit to the government is expected to decline along with deficit reduction. The
authorities are also mindful of the pressures on businesses of slow payment of statutory returns
and trade payables, and intend to implement a more aggressive, multi-faceted approach to tackle
the stock of arrears. Part of the approach will include elimination of zero-ratings in the VAT
system and exchanging owed payments for arrears. Over BDS$200 million in tax returns was
paid out to Barbadians in fiscal year 2015-16, and the government intends to continue to pay tax
refunds in line with cash flows.

Monetary and Financial Sector Policy
Despite a difficult economic environment, the Barbados financial system continues to
demonstrate stability and resilience. The central bank remains focused on preserving the fixed
exchange rate by ensuring adequate reserves and maintaining a small spread between short-term
domestic and U.S. interest rates. Following the April 15, 2015 elimination of the central bank
stipulated minimum deposit rates, there was an attempt to narrow this gap and reduce the
Barbados risk premium through intervention in the Treasury bill auction. However, the minor
rate reductions could not be sustained on account of the government’s cash flow needs, and since
that time the Barbados-U.S. spread has returned to the average levels maintained since 2009.
Our authorities agree with staff that Barbadian banks remain well-capitalized and liquid, with
low exposure to foreign liabilities. In addition, their parent banks and banking systems remain
financially sound, based on national financial stability reports. In 2015, banking sector
performance improved as write-offs of bad loans and non-performing loans decreased, and
profitability increased substantially. However, loan growth overall has remained weak, and
excess cash holdings in 2015 were more than double the required amount. Stress tests of deposittaking institutions and the insurance sector continue to indicate that the system would be able to
withstand a range of adverse shocks.
The Barbados financial system is well-developed, and regulatory and supervisory standards have
continually improved. The authorities are intent on further strengthening financial practices and
regulatory oversight within the Barbados financial system in line with outstanding Financial
Sector Assessment Program and Financial Action Task Force recommendations. Along with
other regional authorities, they are working to alleviate the threat of de-risking by understanding
and addressing the risk concerns of global banks and regulators, and by engaging in global
initiatives that focus on the decline in correspondent banking relationships.
Economic Data
The authorities agree with staff that improving data quality is of high importance. They continue
to work with the Fund’s technical assistance program to resolve outstanding data issues, and are
pressing for a long-term resident advisory to build capacity in this area.
Enhancing Medium-Term Growth
As first outlined in 2013, the key features of the government’s medium-term agenda are aimed at
meeting fiscal and foreign exchange targets as well as objectives for balanced, sustainable and
inclusive economic growth. The strategy for growth is focused on enhancing competiveness and
increasing private sector activity in foreign exchange earning sectors –tourism, international
business, competitive exports (mainly bottled rum and chemical products for household use) –
and developing an alternative energy sector to reduce energy costs. The government supports this
strategy through fiscal incentives for private investment, direct financial support for priority

5
investment projects, infrastructure improvements, and by facilitating a competitive business
environment through efficient provision of public services.
A number of past and more recent measures have been introduced that will support growth
objectives:

In the tourism sector, increased airlift out of key source countries has been negotiated, tax
incentives for tourism services companies have improved, and several high-end hotel and
port development projects have been launched. In addition, the Tourism Development
Act is to be amended to permit eligible hotel property owners to access concessions for
multi-year refurbishment and renovation projects.


The authorities have helped facilitate the launch in March of an international securities
market under the Barbados Stock Exchange, aimed at smaller firms that otherwise might
be unable to sustain a public listing. The market is accompanied by low listing fees and a
comprehensive governance and regulatory framework that is right-sized for small and
mid-sized firms, but more rigorous than many other offshore financial jurisdictions.



In line with the National Policy to help develop the renewable energy sector, legislation
has been passed to support producers and consumers, fiscal incentives to install solar
photovoltaic systems have been introduced, and a floor price for power generated by
independent producers of renewable energy has been established.



In support of productive activity and business expansion, fees and licenses for business
operations have been reduced by 50 percent and the government is in the process of
finalizing a new policy framework for the development of small and medium-size
business. A reimbursable grant of up to BDS$50,000 is to be established to help local
companies improve product and service quality to international standards. In addition, a
5-year plan to improve several major roads and connectivity across the island is being
launched with financial support from the Inter-American Development Bank and the
Latin American Development Bank.

Conclusion
After many challenging years, the Barbados economy is gaining strength, and prior actions by
the Barbadian authorities to address public finances, while safeguarding growth potential and
maintaining social consensus, are taking hold. The August Budget and Financial Statement
demonstrates further movement in the direction of improving Barbados’ position. It also
reinforces the authorities’ commitment to making the appropriate fiscal, financial, and structural
adjustments to significantly reduce the deficit while protecting the ability to generate strong,
sustainable growth. Moreover, the authorities stand ready to take additional measures should
adverse developments threaten to derail the adjustment program. This will require careful,
measured progress supported through Barbados’ strong social partnership framework so that
living standards are not unreasonably impacted and the vulnerable are protected.
