KEY ISSUES
Near-term outlook. In the context of a robust expansion, growth in 2011 is projected
above potential at 4½ percent, supported by both domestic demand and exports,
before easing to 4.2 percent next year. Downside risks are mainly external, including
contagion from fiscal and financial stresses in Europe, weaker growth in advanced
economies or an escalation of geopolitical tensions with North Korea. Domestic risks
relate to higher-than-expected inflation and ongoing weaknesses in the construction
sector.
Ensuring a soft landing. Against the backdrop of a positive and rising output gap, and
easy monetary conditions, further monetary policy tightening and greater two-way
exchange rate flexibility are needed to contain overheating pressures, anchor inflation
expectations, and prevent a further buildup of leverage in the economy.
Enhancing the macrofinancial policy framework. More closely integrating
macroeconomic and financial policies in an internally consistent framework would help
capture their cross-sectoral implications and preempt the buildup of vulnerabilities. Key
elements include incorporating financial stability in the conduct of monetary policy,
harmonizing macroprudential policies with appropriate macroeconomic policy settings,
and integrating longer-term general government liabilities within the fiscal framework.
Ensuring sustainable and equitable growth. Policies need to be stepped up to
ensure that the sources of growth are broadened beyond exports, to make the
economy more resilient to shocks and growth more equitable. Priorities include
reforms to revitalize the nontradables sector and increase the formal labor force
participation rate.

INTRODUCTION
1.

Korea’s rapid recovery from the

global downturn has transitioned into a
full-fledged expansion. This rebound was
initially driven by the normalization of global
trade and supportive macroeconomic and
financial policies. Fiscal policy moved toward
consolidation last year. However, monetary
policy remains accommodative and the real
effective exchange rate is below pre-crisis
levels. As a result, both output and its growth
rate are above the economy’s estimated
potential.

robust and funding conditions for large
corporates are favorable (Figure 2). With the
imposition of a 100 percent loan-to-deposit
(LTD) ratio limit on commercial banks to limit
their non-core funding, nonbank financial
institutions have become a major source of
credit to households. Mortgage lending from
banks has recovered, aided by the temporary
relaxation of borrowing rules to support the
property market in mid-2010 and prevailing
low interest rates. In light of the robust overall
lending to households, their debt is estimated
at 125 percent of disposable income as of
March 2011. Nevertheless, aggregate credit
growth from banks remains subdued,
exacerbated by the expiration of official
guidance to roll over small- and medium-size
enterprise (SME) loans, leading to a pullback of
lending to this sector.

returning to pre-crisis levels. Macroprudential
measures have reduced maturity mismatches,
and coupled with LTD limits, lowered
commercial banks’ reliance on wholesale
funding. However, the share of nonperforming
SME loans remains high as progress on bankled SME restructuring has been slow.2
Weaknesses in the construction and real estate
sector were the predominant cause of the run
on deposits in eight MSBs this year. The
authorities have responded swiftly by
suspending the operations of these banks
while protecting insured deposits. They have
coordinated with commercial banks the
establishment of a Project Financing
Stabilization (PFS) bank—a “bad bank”—to
restructure large PF loans. Some of these loans
are used for funding real estate and
construction projects that also received

B. Outlook and Risks–Robust Growth with Elevated Inflation Pressures
Staff ‘s Views
11.

Buoyant exports and firming

domestic demand, against the backdrop of
accommodative monetary conditions, are
expected to keep growth above its
estimated potential during 2011. With the
expected fading of temporary factors, Korea’s
exports are projected to remain strong,
leading to a current account surplus of around
1 percent of GDP this year. With capacity

utilization near all-time highs and business
confidence robust, facilities investment is
projected to improve in the second half of the
year in line with exports. With strengthening
employment and the stabilization of food and
fuel prices, household incomes are expected to
buoy consumption growth. As a result, growth
for 2011 as a whole is projected at 4.5 percent,
above its estimated potential of 4 percent,
before easing to 4.2 percent next year.

The authorities have also set up a new Special
Account with a target size of W 15 trillion by 2026 to
cover losses on MSB deposits occurring after 2011.
The Special Account will be funded mainly through
100 percent of deposit insurance premiums of MSBs
and 45 percent of the premiums paid by all other
financial institutions.

POLICY THEME #1—ENSURING A SOFT LANDING
The main policy challenge for the near term is to ensure a soft landing through
appropriate macroeconomic and macroprudential policies. This primarily requires further
monetary tightening and greater two-way exchange rate flexibility. The budgeted fiscal
stance for 2011 is appropriate, with room to accelerate fiscal consolidation during 2012–

On June 30, the Ministry of Strategy and Finance

Background
18.

Despite some tightening, monetary

policy remains accommodative and the
exchange rate is below its long-run average
(Figure 3). Policy rates were appropriately
lowered during the global financial crisis, and
were raised by a cumulative 125 bps since last
July as economic conditions improved. The
policy rate now is some 75 bps below neutral,
with the real rate around -1 percent. Despite

In addition, steady monetary policy tightening
could help limit the further buildup of leverage
in the nonfinancial private sector. Delays in
monetary tightening would eventually require
larger rate hikes in the future to reanchor
inflation expectations, which could be
financially destabilizing, given the high
indebtedness of households and SMEs. This
may lead to a hard landing for the economy
and hence should be avoided.

The fiscal policy stance was swiftly

normalized after the crisis. Following the
withdrawal of stimulus last year, the budgeted
fiscal stance in 2011 is estimated as broadly
neutral. The impact of the corporate and
personal income tax cuts that were
implemented in 2008–09 has been neutralized
through base broadening and restraining
expenditure growth. The medium-term
consolidation path targets budget balance by
2013–14, excluding social security funds.

monetary policy. Given the economy’s cyclical
position, at a minimum, the projected revenue
overperformance in 2011 should be saved,

through expenditure cuts elsewhere. Although
the medium-term balanced budget target
remains appropriate, there is also room to
accelerate consolidation plans in 2012. The

(MaPPs). Another important step is to strengthen the nontradables sector as a second
engine of growth to reduce the economy’s vulnerability to external shocks, address
longer-term challenges, and help growth become more equitable.

channels for the propagation of shocks.

Box 1. Capital Flow Measures in Korea1
After the global crisis, Korea introduced several
measures to improve the resilience of the
financial sector to risks from volatile capital
inflows. The authorities aimed to address two main
concerns: (i) persistent inflows could increase
vulnerabilities in the financial sector and lead to
excessive exchange rate volatility, and (ii) short-term
inflows may turn into a destabilizing “sudden stop”
as experienced during the crisis:


Measures introduced in November 2009 aimed
at reducing the foreign currency maturity
mismatch of banks, improving the quality of
liquid assets, reducing wholesale and short-term
external debt funding, and limiting the foreign
currency (fx) borrowing of the corporate sector.



The June 2010 measures further tightened the
regulation on banks’ fx maturity mismatch and
leverage in the corporate sector. Ceilings on
banks’ fx derivative contracts relative to capital
and restrictions on firms’ fx financing were
introduced.



In January 2011, a withholding tax on
nonresident purchases of Treasury and
Monetary Stabilization Bonds was reintroduced.
The current rate does not discriminate against
nonresidents, but it can be adjusted depending
on the inflows.

______________________

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND



In April 2011, a macroprudential stability levy
was introduced, effective from August 2011, on
the non-core fx liabilities of banks. The levy is
adjustable, with a maximum of 100 bps.



Measures introduced in May 2011 further
reduced banks’ fx derivative ceiling, effective
from June 2011.

Measures targeting the banking system’s
vulnerabilities appear to be more effective than
those aimed at reducing bond inflows. The set of
measures targeting the excess buildup of fx leverage
appears to have prevented banks’ outstanding
short-term debt from returning to pre-crisis levels.
However, changes in shipbuilders’ demand for fx
hedges through forward contracts also contributed
to these shifts. Measures intended to reduce bond
inflows, on the other hand, do not seem to have had
enduring effects. Even though foreign investment in
public bonds is lower than its January level, this also
reflects the rise in inflation expectations and an
overall decline in capital inflows to emerging
markets.

REPUBLIC OF KOREA 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Box 2. The Korean Housing Market Policies: Price Stability at a Cost1
The Korean government has actively pursued
housing market policies with multiple objectives.
The toolkit has comprised of prudential measures such
as loan-to-value (LTV) and debt-to-income (DTI) limits,
introduced in 2002 and 2005, respectively, as well as
other measures to manage the demand and supply of
housing. These include adjustments to taxes on
housing transactions and capital gains, subsidized
financing, purchases of unsold houses, support to the
construction sector, and moral suasion on lenders.
Historical house price dynamics indicate that these
measures have limited movements of nationwide house
prices between zero and the rate of growth of nominal
GDP. Other priorities have at various times been to limit
household indebtedness, support real estate and
construction SMEs, and maintain consumer confidence.
More recently, plans have been announced to improve
household balance sheets, such as by encouraging
fixed-rate amortizing mortgages.

While these policies have largely succeeded in
managing house price dynamics, they have
contributed to the buildup of vulnerabilities in both
public and private sector balance sheets:



bullet mortgages, most of which are rolled over on
a three-year basis.



Construction and real estate SMEs: Steady house
price appreciation and purchases of unsold houses
have encouraged overexpansion and excessive
leverage among SMEs in the sector, and severe
balance sheet problems in recent years.



Financial institutions: While banks’ exposure to
households’ credit risk is contained through LTV
and DTI limits, excessive leverage in the
construction and real estate SMEs has created
distress among MSBs that are heavily engaged in
project financing.



Quasi-fiscal costs: Housing market policies have
contributed to the rapid buildup of leverage of
KLHC, whose debt-to-equity ratio tripled from 2007
to end-2010 to around 559 percent.

Households: Despite the stringent LTV and DTI
regulations, entrenched expectations of steady
house price appreciation have made housing an
attractive investment and source of collateralized
credit for uses other than housing. These policies
have contributed to rising household leverage
and a preference for short-term floating rate

Box 3. The Social Cost of Not Rebalancing: Rising Income Inequality in Korea1
Income inequality in Korea increased faster than
the OECD average over the past decade. The Gini
coefficient rose by 5½ percentage points during
1997–2008, driven mostly by rising old age poverty,
before flattening out in 2009 and slightly improving
in 2010. Although rising income inequality is a global
phenomenon, in Korea it is closely linked to the
economic polarization between those that work in
the tradables (mostly manufacturing) sector and
those in the nontradables (mostly services) sector,
and labor market practices:

The workers in the nontradables sector fell
behind due to the faster decline in relative
productivity compared with the OECD average.
While the manufacturing sector went through
significant restructuring in the aftermath of the
Asian crisis, the nontradables sector has not
undergone any comparable restructuring.
Moreover, there has been a shift in labor from
manufacturing to services since the crisis. The
services sector now accounts for around 70
percent of employment, most of which is in
SMEs, translating into weak income growth for a
large segment of the working population.

The deteriorating terms of trade have arguably

they have grown at the same pace, accompanied
by flat terms of trade.



The share of nonregular workers grew from 17 to
29 percent of total employment during 2001–06,
the fastest in the OECD. Moreover, compared to
the OECD average, nonregular workers are more
concentrated in the nontradables sector, include
more women, and have three times more
workers aged above 55. Labor market duality has
implications for the welfare of nonregular
workers, as they face substantially higher income
volatility, and are less likely to be covered by the
social safety net.

ANNEX II. STATISTICAL ISSUES
ANNEX II: KOREA—STATISTICAL ISSUES
As of June 9, 2011
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is adequate for surveillance.
National Accounts: The overall structure of the national accounts follows the recommendations of the
1993 System of National Accounts. Chain-linked (reference year 2005) and nominal GDP estimates are
compiled using the production and expenditure approaches; nominal GDP estimates are also compiled
using the income approach. After the revision to reference year 2005, the estimation method for
expenditure components has been altered from the commodity flow method to the direct estimation
method, in which each expenditure component is measured directly. The size of the informal sector has
not been measured. Improved methods are required to adjust quarterly (seasonally-unadjusted) GDP
estimates to agree with annual (benchmark) GDP estimates.
Consumer Price Index: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) covers 38 urban areas (about 80 percent of the
urban population), but excludes farm and fishing households. The CPI could be further improved by
extending coverage to rural areas. The consumption basket is updated only every five years; currently,
expenditure weights are derived from the 2005 Family Income and Expenditure Survey and are in need of
updating. The geometric mean of price changes should be used as a suitable alternative to the ratio of
arithmetic means of prices.
Producer Price Index: The Producer Price Index (PPI) covers all domestic industrial activities and a large
segment of service activity. It excludes exported products, however, because the Export Price Indexes are
compiled separately in Korea. The weights are based on 2005 revenue shares and are in need of
updating. The PPI could be improved by making more use of imputing missing prices using the prices of
similar commodities, rather than carrying forward the last reported price. Although an arithmetic mean of
price relatives is currently used rather than a geometric mean, a supplementary index is also compiled
using a geometric mean. However, the headline PPI should be changed to the one based on a geometric
mean at the elementary level. The PPI classification by activity conforms to the KSIC, which is itself based
on the International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC)––with slight modifications only to reflect local
considerations. The Korean commodity classification used for the PPI does not conform to the Central
Product Classification (CPC) and one based on the CPC should be adopted as soon as possible.
Government Finance Statistics: Two sets of government finance statistics (GFS) are compiled for the
central government, one using national definitions and the other using internationally recognized
standards. Concepts and definitions used in the latter still follow the recommendations of the Manual on
Government Finance Statistics 1986. The authorities have embarked on an ambitious program to
implement reporting according to GFSM 2001, by 2012. The 2009 ROSC indicated that while compilation
practices are generally sound, some room for improvement of the accessibility and timeliness of data and
metadata existed. Following the 2009 ROSC, the Korean authorities resumed reporting consolidated GFS
data on the general government for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSY).
The timeliness of these data does not comply with SDDS requirements, mainly due to the lack in
timeliness on local government source data. During the 2009 ROSC, the authorities also agreed to

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 5

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

REPUBLIC OF KOREA

improve national dissemination practices and initiated work on improving national websites. However,
high frequency data for inclusion in the International Financial Statistics (IFS) are not yet reported.

Financial Sector Data: Monetary and financial statistics compiled by the Bank of Korea (BOK) broadly
follow the IMF’s Monetary and Financial Statistical Manual 2000. Data relating to foreign assets and
foreign liabilities are affected by the BOK practice of valuing its financial assets and liabilities at book
value (rather than at market value) and revaluing its foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities
twice yearly (rather than on a monthly basis). The BOK is in discussion with STA about reporting monetary
and financial statistics using Standardized Report Forms (SRFs) and drafting related notes for publication
in the IFS. A draft SRF for the central bank (form 1SR) was recently reported to STA and the BOK
anticipates providing the other SRFs within this calendar year.
Korea participates in the regular reporting of Financial Soundness Indicators (FSIs) to the IMF for
dissemination on its website. FSI data and metadata are available to the public through the IMF’s website
at: http://fsi/FSIHome.aspx#Country.
External Sector Statistics: Korea follows the Balance of Payments Manual, fifth Edition (BPM5)
framework for the compilation of the external sector statistics, although with a few deviations; the scope
of the transactions of enterprises through accounts held abroad and of reinvested earnings is partial;
trade credits with affiliated entities are recorded under other investment; and income transactions are
recorded on a cash flow basis. Based on latest information from the authorities, improved reinvested
earnings data are to be disseminated by no later than 2012. Since January 2010, short-term loans to
affiliated entities are classified in direct investment.
The quality of the quarterly external debt statistics has greatly improved. In early 2007, the BOK switched
from annual to quarterly reporting of the International Investment Position. Data dissemination on
international reserves and foreign currency liquidity generally meets the SDDS specifications. Since
April 2006, the authorities have disseminated foreign reserves data on a monthly basis rather than twice a
month, as had been done since 1997.
The BOK has plans to migrate to the Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual,
sixth edition (BPM6); the authorities have already assessed the resources and institutional arrangements
for the implementation.
Korea reports balance of payments and IIP data for IFS (quarterly data) and Balance of Payments Statistics
Yearbook (annual data) publications.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Korea has subscribed to the Fund’s Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS) since September
1996, and it uses an SDDS flexibility option on the
timeliness of the general government operations
and analytical accounts of the banking sector data.
Korea is also availing itself of a relevant flexibility
option for the coverage of exchange rates.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with the
Republic of Korea
On July 29, 2011 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with the Republic of Korea. 1
Background
Following a rapid recovery from the global financial crisis, growth in 2010 reached an
impressive 6.2 percent, led by exports and domestic demand. Momentum eased in the first half
of 2011, reflecting the maturing of the expansion, the adjustment in global inventories, and the
weaknesses in the construction sector. Growth in 2011 is projected above potential at 4½
percent, led by exports and firming domestic demand, before easing to 4.2 percent next year.
Risks to the outlook are broadly balanced.
Aggregate demand pressures, compounded by the rise in food and fuel prices, have led
inflation to remain above the Bank of Korea’s (BOK) inflation target of 3 ± 1 percent thus far this
year. Headline CPI inflation, after having eased to 4.1 percent in May, returned to its year-todate peak of 4.7 percent in July. Core inflation has continuously risen since December 2010.
Wage pressures are not yet apparent due to lagged wage negotiations, even though
employment growth and the unemployment rate have reverted to pre-crisis levels.
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of
the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2

Exports have been strong, primarily to China and other fast growing emerging markets, but with
rising fuel prices and increasing domestic demand for imports, the current account surplus has
narrowed relative to last year. Korea is now the world’s seventh largest holder of international
reserves, which have risen to US$304 billion. The real effective exchange rate has appreciated
2.1 percent from end-2010 through June 2011, but still remains below the pre-crisis levels and
its 2000–07 average.
Against the background of ample global liquidity, Korea’s strong growth and a perceived oneway bet on the currency have led to large portfolio inflows, boosting equity prices to near alltime highs. The external short-term debt of Korean banks has been maintained below pre-crisis
peaks, although these flows have strengthened recently.
Despite subdued credit growth from commercial banks, overall credit to households continues
to be robust, driven primarily by nonbank financial institutions. As a result, household debt
remains high at 125 percent of household disposable income. Corporate funding conditions are
favorable, except for medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), reflecting the weaknesses in the
construction and real estate sector and the expiration of guidance to roll over SME loans.
National house prices are now 8.4 percent above their post-crisis lows.
The commercial banking system’s capital adequacy ratio stood at 14.3 percent, while the
nonperforming loan ratio remains low at 1.3 percent. Commercial banks have also reduced their
reliance on wholesale funding, with loan-to-deposit ratios declining to 96½ percent. However,
the large exposure of Mutual Saving Banks (MSB) to the weak construction and real estate
sector has led to deposit runs on eight MSBs, which have been suspended.
The authorities moved decisively toward fiscal policy consolidation since last year. The budget
deficit, excluding social security funds, is projected to decline to 0.6 percent of GDP in 2011,
from 1.1 percent of GDP in 2010, driven by expenditure restraint and efforts to broaden the tax
bases. This implies a broadly neutral fiscal stance in 2011. The BOK has raised the policy rate
by a cumulative 125 basis points—from an all-time low of 2 percent—since July 2010. However,
monetary policy remains accommodative with real policy rate at -1 percent. The authorities have
implemented several administrative price stabilization measures to address rising inflation. They
also introduced several measures to address capital flow volatility, including by limiting banks’
foreign currency derivative positions and reinstating the withholding tax on foreign holdings of
Treasury and Monetary Stabilization Bonds. They have also adjusted various elements of their
housing market policies over the cycle to support the sector.

Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the solid, broad-based recovery of the economy from the global
financial crisis, buttressed by the authorities’ skillful economic management. Growth is expected
to continue robustly above its potential this year, and the medium-term outlook remains
favorable. Directors noted the buildup of inflationary pressures and near-term risks linked to
uncertainties in the global economy and financial markets. They agreed that the immediate
policy priority is to ensure a soft landing and safeguard financial stability—through proactive
monetary tightening, greater exchange rate flexibility, and ongoing fiscal consolidation,
complemented by macroprudential policies.
Directors supported the broadly neutral stance of fiscal policy, and welcomed the plan to
balance the central government budget by 2013–14. They encouraged the authorities to save
revenue overperformance and stand ready to accelerate consolidation in 2012 should
aggregate demand pressures persist. Directors stressed the need to continue strengthening the
medium-term fiscal framework, particularly by introducing a structural fiscal rule linking future
liabilities—including those related to population aging and public enterprise debt—to annual
budgets. Broadening the tax base, streamlining subsidies, and reforming entitlement programs
are also essential to ensure long-term fiscal sustainability.
Directors welcomed the resilience of Korea’s overall financial system, with well-capitalized
banks and low nonperforming loans. While noting that problems in some mutual savings banks
do not pose a systemic risk, they recommended a restructuring of the industry, including
through strengthening its risk management and governance. Directors welcomed recent steps
toward that end and plans for further improving the supervisory framework more broadly.
Directors underlined the importance of enhancing the macrofinancial policy framework. They
generally saw merit in further integrating macroeconomic and financial policies into a coherent
framework, allowing policymakers to capture cross-sectoral linkages and detect vulnerabilities
early on. In this context, Directors agreed that overall price stability should remain the central
bank’s primary objective, and most Directors saw scope for making interest rate policy more
responsive to financial stability considerations. Directors encouraged the authorities to gradually
phase out administrative price stabilization measures.
Directors considered macroprudential tools a useful complement to macroeconomic policies in
addressing financial stability concerns arising from capital inflows. They saw the benefits of
greater exchange rate flexibility in managing capital flows and absorbing external shocks.
Directors also noted a role for market-based housing policies in containing leverage among
households.
Directors underscored the need to rebalance the sources of growth, reducing Korea’s
vulnerability to shocks and promoting inclusive growth. This requires comprehensive reforms

4
aimed at enhancing productivity and competition in the nontradables sector—creating a level
playing field with the manufacturing sector while also reducing household indebtedness and
social disparities. Further efforts are needed to deregulate the service sector and expedite a
bank-led restructuring of small- and medium-sized enterprises. Directors supported labor
market policies to increase formal employment opportunities for women and the elderly, while
expanding the coverage of the social safety net to address dualities in the labor market.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat
Reader to view this pdf file) for the 2011 Article IV Consultation with the Republic of Korea is also
available.
