STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Inflation has subsided, but longstanding vulnerabilities are becoming increasingly
apparent. Economic growth is holding up well, inflation has fallen below the central
bank’s target, and fiscal and external buffers remain large. But the economy’s
dependence on the hydrocarbon sector has led to serious vulnerabilities that are now
coming to light. Stagnating hydrocarbon production and declining oil prices, combined
with increasing domestic consumption of hydrocarbon products, are depressing export
receipts. Public spending continues to increase, fueling imports and a loss of
competitiveness, and placing fiscal policy on an increasingly unsustainable path. As a
result, the current account is expected to record a deficit in 2014 for the first time in
more than 15 years. Unemployment remains high among youth and women.
Algeria needs to consolidate macroeconomic and financial stability. A full-fledged
fiscal rule, combined with an ambitious consolidation effort over the medium term,
would help put the fiscal stance on a sustainable path. The decline in inflation
experienced since the 2012 is a positive outcome that needs to be maintained through
continued efforts to absorb liquidity and a more active use of interest rates. The
exchange rate policy should avoid deviations of the dinar from its equilibrium level, and
should support the deepening of forex markets. The implementation of FSAP
recommendations should be pursued, notably to strengthen financial sector stability.
An export-oriented strategy is needed to ensure external sustainability. Export
diversification is imperative to ensure external sustainability and reduce vulnerability to
fluctuating oil prices. Diversification policies should focus on maintaining economic
stability and improving competitiveness, increasing openness to trade and capital flows,
(particularly FDI), and creating a more export-friendly business climate. Additional
reforms are needed to increase hydrocarbon exports, including reforms to increase
production and phase-out implicit subsidies on energy and electricity, which are fueling
domestic consumption.
Algeria’s significant growth potential needs to be more fully realized. Reforms are
needed to reduce the dominance of the public sector and transform the private sector
into an engine for growth, supported by a deeper financial sector. To increase
employment, Algeria will need better-functioning labor markets, a workforce equipped
with more relevant skills, and more effective labor market programs.
Exchange rate regime. The de facto exchange rate regime is classified as “other
managed arrangement.” Algeria has accepted the obligations of Article VIII Sections 2(a),
3, and 4.

INTRODUCTION
1.
Economic activity is expected to pick up in 2014. The hydrocarbon sector, which has been
contracting in recent years, is expected to expand modestly, while nonhydrocarbon growth remains
relatively robust. Inflation has fallen below the central bank’s target, thanks in part to tighter
monetary policy, but new pressures could emerge. External and fiscal buffers remain large, and the
financial sector is generally healthy but underdeveloped.
2.
Long-standing vulnerabilities are coming into light. For the first time in nearly 15 years, the
current account will record a deficit, as strong domestic hydrocarbon consumption and lower oil
prices weigh on exports while (largely investment-related) imports continue to grow. After some
consolidation in 2013, the fiscal deficit is projected to widen once again, further jeopardizing longterm sustainability. The economy remains overly dependent on the hydrocarbon sector and public
spending, and is therefore vulnerable to a protracted decline in oil prices. Unemployment has
stabilized at high levels, especially among youth and women.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
3.
Growth and inflation. Real GDP grew by 2.8 percent in 2013, down from 3.3 percent in
2012, affected by a 5.5 percent contraction in hydrocarbon production—the eighth consecutive year
of decline—and lower public spending. Nonhydrocarbon sector growth remained stable at
7.1 percent, supported by continued rapid growth in the agricultural and services sectors. Inflation
declined from 8.9 percent in 2012 to 3.3 percent, reflecting the impact of fiscal consolidation,
monetary policy tightening, softer international food prices, and high base effects. Average inflation
continued to decline in 2014, reaching 1.5 percent in August, but was somewhat on the rise at
2.7 percent on a year-on-year basis.
4.
External position. The current account surplus narrowed to 0.4 percent of GDP in 2013
from 5.9 percent in 2012. Hydrocarbon exports fell more than 10 percent because of softer prices
and lower volumes. Imports expanded by nearly 7 percent, partly owing to the one-off effect of
increased imports of petroleum products following the temporary shutdown of three refineries.
Inflows of foreign direct investment remained weak, at less than 1 percent of GDP, and the level of
foreign exchange reserves increased slightly, from US$191 billion to US$194 billion, mainly because
of valuation effects. External debt stood at 1.6 percent of GDP at end-2013.
5.
Real effective exchange rate. After depreciating by 1.7 percent in 2013, the real effective
exchange rate (REER) weakened further in 2014, by 0.9 percent over the first seven months of the
year. This was partly driven by a 0.3 percent nominal effective depreciation. However, the REER
remains on the strong side, hurting Algeria’s competitiveness (Appendix I).
6.
Fiscal. After two years of significant fiscal stimulus, the government undertook some fiscal
consolidation in 2013. Current spending declined as back-payments of civil service wage increases
tapered, and limited absorptive capacity held back the execution of capital spending. As a result, the
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ALGERIA

budget deficit fell to 1.5 percent of GDP from 5.0 percent in 2012, despite lower revenues linked to
weak hydrocarbon exports. Savings in the oil stabilization fund decreased slightly for the first time
since the fund was created, though it is still standing at a comfortable 31.6 percent of GDP at end2013. The consolidation trend was not continued into 2014, however: during the first half of 2014,
capital expenditure increased by nearly 50 percent and current expenditure by 10.4 percent, while
revenues grew by only 4.4 percent, slowed by a 2.4 percent decline in hydrocarbon revenues.
7.
Monetary. Credit to the economy expanded by nearly 20 percent in 2013. Nevertheless,
broad money growth slowed to 8.4 percent from 10.9 percent in 2012, largely because of slower
accumulation of net foreign assets. Increases in the required reserve ratio and greater liquidity
absorption helped reduce excess liquidity in 2013. Excess liquidity rebounded in 2014, increasing by
18 percent in the second quarter compared to the same quarter in 2013. Broad money grew by
7.7 percent in the first half of 2014, driven by credit growth and by a 10 percent decrease in
government deposits at central bank.
8.
Financial sector. The banking sector remained solvent and liquid. The overall capital
adequacy ratio was 21.5 percent in 2013, down slightly from 23.4 percent in 2012. The ratio of
nonperforming loans (NPLs) improved from 11.5 percent to 10.6 percent, helped by the growth in
credit. Nearly 70 percent of NPLs are fully provisioned. Liquidity remains at a comfortable level.
Credit to the economy reached 45.2 percent of nonhydrocarbon GDP in 2013, up from 41.3 percent
in 2012, remaining weak compared to the region or other middle-income countries. Financial
markets are underdeveloped, and little progress has been made in this area. One private company
was listed on the stock exchange in 2013. Capitalization remained low at 0.1 percent of GDP, and the
stock of outstanding bonds issued by the private sector continued to decline.
9.
Employment. Following a slight uptick in 2012, the overall unemployment rate declined to
9.8 percent in 2013. It remained stable in the first quarter of 2014, as the decline in the participation
rate offset the 2.1 percent fall in the volume of employment. Youth unemployment stood at
24.8 percent. The unemployment rate among women continued to fall, reaching 14.2 percent in the
first quarter of 2014.
10.

Outlook.



Real GDP growth is expected to increase to 4.0 percent. The hydrocarbon sector should record
slightly positive growth (0.4 percent) for the first time in nine years, driven by growth in
domestic consumption and a less acute contraction in net hydrocarbon export volumes.
Nonhydrocarbon growth is expected to slow modestly to 5.5 percent owing to a poor wheat
harvest and a slowdown in industrial activity. Inflation should stabilize close to the 4 percent
target of the central bank, but bears watching closely, given the potential for new inflation
pressures to emerge.



The current account is projected to record a deficit (-4.0 percent of GDP) for the first time since
1999. Over the medium term, current account deficits are expected to widen as lower oil prices
outweigh modest growth in hydrocarbon export volumes. Foreign exchange reserves are

ALGERIA

projected to decrease by US$6 billion in 2014, reaching US$188 billion at the end of the year.
Over the medium term, import coverage is projected to fall to 17 months, as low levels of capital
inflows fail to finance current account deficits.


The fiscal deficit is expected to widen to 7.0 percent of GDP, mostly because of lower hydrocarbon
and custom revenue and a sharp increase in capital expenditure. With domestic bond issuance
still limited, the deficit will be financed mainly by drawing from the oil savings fund (Fonds de
Régulation des Recettes, FRR), which is projected to decline in absolute terms and fall from
31.6 percent to 27.1 percent of GDP. Fiscal deficits are expected to persist over the medium term
as hydrocarbon revenues weaken. The nonhydrocarbon deficit is, however, expected to improve,
helped by improved nonhydrocarbon revenue and contained current spending. Despite this
consolidation, the fiscal path will remain unsustainable, and fiscal breakeven prices are expected
to remain above projected oil prices.



Monetary sector. Broad money should increase by 14.5 percent in 2014, largely because of rapid
growth of credit to the economy (+21.7 percent) and a decline in government savings, while
growth in net foreign assets should be limited to 0.5 percent. Over the medium term, slower
credit growth, increased domestic issuance by the government (as opposed to drawing down
deposits at the central bank), and a decline in net foreign assets should contribute to more
moderate growth in the money supply.

11.
Risks are mainly tilted to the downside (Boxes 1 and 2). Slower growth in Europe and
emerging markets, or a sustained decline in hydrocarbon prices, would worsen external and
fiscal balances. Heightened geopolitical risks in Ukraine or the Middle East could negatively affect
the country should they lead to weaker global demand or an increase in the risk premium, but could
constitute upside risks if oil and gas prices or demand for Algerian gas increased. On the domestic
front, social pressures complicate the task of fiscal consolidation and therefore pose a continued
threat to fiscal sustainability

Algeria's exposure to global financial market volatility is very limited. With a
closed capital account preventing corporates and banks from borrowing
internationally, risks related to both capital outflows and inflows are marginal.
Algeria would mainly be affected by bond market volatility, as the country's
sizeable reserves are invested in high-grade sovereign bonds--although risks are
mitigated by the hold-to-maturity policy of the central bank. Protracted low
international interest rates would lower interest earnings for the central bank,
thereby hurting dividends paid to the government. Algeria does not borrow on
international markets and would not be affected by a reassessment of its own risk
profile.

A prudent financial liberalization is needed to support the development of the
country. Further enhancements to the reserve management framework would
help strengthen resilience to bond market volatility. A full-fledged sovereign
wealth fund could help increase returns from the sizeable external asset position.

A slowdown in growth in other advanced economies, emerging markets, or China

ALGERIA

Box 2. Algeria: Spillover Risks
Algeria’s potential for external spillovers is limited. Financial flows are limited, and the share of Algeria’s
imports in its partners’ exports is too small for a shock in Algeria to significantly affect its trading partners.
With relatively well-supplied oil markets, a shock to Algeria’s oil production is unlikely to trigger a significant
adjustment in global oil prices. A negative shock to gas production may, however, trigger a tightening of
prices in gas markets, notably in Europe, as Algeria’s exports account for more than 10 percent of Europe’s
imports.
Hydrocarbon dependency and trade with Europe remain the principal source of internal spillovers.
The capital account is almost closed, and external financing needs are covered by ample reserves. This
insulates the country from the impact of shocks to global financial markets. Algeria is extremely dependent
on hydrocarbon exports and is therefore highly exposed to shocks to oil prices. Europe accounts for more
than 50 percent of Algeria’s trade—a share that has been growing since 2007. Slower growth in Europe
would negatively affect the country through a decline in demand and, potentially, in oil and gas prices, with
both effects worsening the trade and fiscal balances. Recent tensions in Eastern European gas markets could,
however, create positive spillovers if they increase demand for Algeria’s gas exports and reinforce its
reputation as a reliable gas partner.

The composition of Algeria’s export partners is changing, giving rise to both new risks and
opportunities. The shale oil production boom in the United States has led to a redirection of Algeria’s light
crude oil exports (for which shale oil is a substitute) away from the United States toward Asian countries
(notably China). As a consequence, the profile of Algeria’s external risks is changing. The broadening of the
export partner base weakens the impact of a demand shock in Europe. At the same time, it exposes the
country to new risks, especially to a slowdown in China.

The main challenges for Algeria are to consolidate long-term macroeconomic stability
and promote economic diversification and job creation. An integrated strategy is needed,
whereby the policy mix supports both the stability and competitiveness of the economy; public
investment and appropriate structural reforms foster private investment; openness and
competitiveness policies prop up exports; and a well-functioning labor market, strong institutions,
and a improved jobs-skills match help achieve a substantial decline in unemployment.
Box 3. Algeria: Authorities’ Response to Past IMF Policy Recommendations
The authorities generally agree with staff’s policy recommendations, but implementation suffers from slow
decision-making processes. Progress continued to be recorded in macroeconomic management, with
prudent monetary policy and fiscal consolidation bringing inflation well below the central bank target. There
were also advances on technical but important measures aimed at improving macroeconomic management
(such as the MTBF) and macro-financial stability (such as the recommendations of the 2013 FSAP). However,
measures that require a stronger political commitment or that would weaken the State’s control of the
economy remained on hold; these include the relaxation of restrictions on FDI, the opening of SOEs’ capital,
and the phasing-out of implicit subsidies.

THEME 1. CONSOLIDATING MACROECONOMIC AND
FINANCIAL STABILITY
13.
The current fiscal stance is unsustainable, and calls for the adoption of a full-fledged
fiscal rule. Fiscal policy is procyclical, vulnerable to oil price volatility, and on an unsustainable path.
Staff advised that a fiscal rule would help reduce vulnerability to oil price shocks, impose spending
discipline, and ensure long-term fiscal sustainability. An appropriate fiscal rule would entail a
realistic reference price (for instance, a 5- or 10-year backward-looking moving average), a floor on
the structural primary balance, and a cap on drawings from the FRR. Staff also recommended
converting the FRR into a sovereign wealth fund invested abroad and targeting a range of
objectives, including macroeconomic stabilization and the accumulation of savings for future
generations. It could be managed by the Bank of Algeria (BA), following an investment policy
defined by the Minister of Finance and adhering to international best practices. The authorities
expressed some interest in a fiscal rule, but remained reluctant to convert the FRR into a sovereign
wealth fund. Given their lack of expertise in financial markets, the authorities prefer to maintain the
existing arrangement, whereby the counterpart of the FRR is a subset of international reserves,
which are managed prudently by the central bank.

The fiscal rule suggests that Algeria needs determined and consistent fiscal
consolidation beyond the limited fiscal adjustment achieved in 2013. Restoring sustainability
according to the fiscal rule would require significant and sustained fiscal consolidation. The
magnitude of the required consolidation is ambitious and should be undertaken immediately; to
delay would necessitate even more ambitious consolidation in the future. Reforms are needed to:


12

Increase nonhydrocarbon revenues. Staff estimates that Algeria’s tax potential in 2013 was 3.3
percentage points of nonhydrocarbon GDP higher than actual collected tax revenues. Closing
this gap will require broadening the tax base and strengthening tax administration. Tax
exemptions should be eliminated or reduced, the distortive turnover tax should be replaced with

well-targeted excise, and the property tax should be overhauled. Staff welcomed an increase in
the ceiling for the corporate flat rate tax, which was announced in the 2015 budget law; it should
lead to higher returns and free resources within the General Tax Directorate for expanding the
tax base. While the authorities broadly agreed that nonhydrocarbon revenues need to increase,
they saw merit in continuing to grant tax exemptions, notably to promote investment, and were
cautious about introducing new taxes before first developing a broader domestic consensus,
including with local governments, around a revenue strategy.


Limit current spending while preserving growth-enhancing capital spending. Current spending has
increased significantly since 2010 and is projected to reach 36.2 percent of nonhydrocarbon GDP
in 2014, a level that constrains fiscal space. Staff advised the authorities to contain the wage bill
by stabilizing the size of the civil service and limiting wage increases to productivity gains. Staff
also cautioned against modifications to the labor code (Article 87 bis) that could lead to a
significant increase in the wage bill. Current transfers are high, and their growth should be
capped in real terms while the efficiency of public service provision should be improved. Capital
spending should be preserved in real terms. The authorities stressed that any future wage
increases linked to the modification of Article 87bis would be modest and phased in gradually.



Gradually phase out explicit and implicit subsidies and develop a targeted cash transfer system.
Total subsidies amounted to 18 percent of GDP in 2012, of which implicit hydrocarbon subsidies
accounted for 10.9 percent of GDP. Staff recommended phasing out implicit subsidies—which
are inequitable (Appendix 2), costly in terms of foregone revenue, and lead to episodic bailout of
state-owned enterprises—and adjusting long-unchanged tariffs on public services. Furthermore,
any remaining implicit subsidy should be accounted for in the budget. A subsidy reform should
be accompanied by targeted cash transfers to shield vulnerable populations. While the
authorities disclosed the cost of subsidies in the 2014 and 2015 budget laws, they underscored
the difficulties of undertaking such a major reform and highlighted the need for careful
preparation.

15.
Full implementation of staff’s recommendations is necessary to place fiscal policy on a
sustainable path. In the baseline scenario discussed with the authorities, the government is
assumed to achieve fiscal consolidation equal to 10.3 percent of nonhydrocarbon GDP over the
medium term, based on a

lead to an additional consolidation of nearly 8 percent of nonhydrocarbon GDP, which would place
fiscal policy on a sustainable path and help contain the deterioration of the current account by
constraining domestic demand.
16.
Public financial management needs to be modernized. The MTBF and performancebased budgeting is scheduled for introduction on a trial basis with the 2016 budget law. A revised
organic budget law, adopted, ideally, in the first quarter of 2015, would help support this reform.
Staff and the authorities agreed that progress in the implementation of an integrated public
financial management system would be critical to the effective operation of the new framework.
Finally, staff advised the detailed publication of hydrocarbon revenues, in a format similar to the EITI.
17.
Monetary policy should remain prudent. Although inflation fell to 1.5 percent on average
in August, year-on-year inflation has been on an upward trend since October 2013, reaching
2.7 percent in August. Strong credit growth, a surge in capital spending in the first half of 2014, the
possibility of further wage increases, and an upturn in excess liquidity suggest that inflationary
pressures could reemerge. In this context, the authorities and staff agreed on the need to maintain a
prudent stance.

Efforts to absorb excess liquidity should continue. The BA should increase liquidity absorption by
auctioning central bank bills, thereby adding another instrument to a monetary policy toolkit
that relies largely on the auctioning of deposit facilities. Enhanced coordination with the Ministry
of Finance would help improve the liquidity management framework. The government’s more
ambitious program of Treasury bills issuance is a welcome development that has helped to
partially normalize yields on short-term securities. Given the low level of domestic debt and
excess demand on the financial markets, there is scope for more sovereign issuance. This would
limit liquidity injections resulting from drawings on the FRR; help develop monetary and capital
markets; and strengthen monetary policy transmission mechanisms.

Exchange rate policy should aim to avoid a deviation of the dinar from its equilibrium
level. International reserves are well above standard adequacy levels (Appendix I), but external
stability is a growing concern, given a rapidly deteriorating current account and a relatively short
time horizon for hydrocarbon resources. In this context, the authorities should keep the exchange
rate in line with its fundamental equilibrium value. Staff estimates that the real effective exchange
rate was overvalued by about 3.4 percent in 2014 (Appendix I), and by over 10 percent compared to
its medium-term equilibrium value, given the projected fiscal consolidation and declining
hydrocarbon prices. While they reiterated their commitment to avoid any misalignment, the
authorities felt that staff’s estimates overstated the degree of overvaluation.


The supply of foreign exchange needs to be diversified in order to create a deeper, more
competitive foreign exchange market. The BA is currently the main supplier of foreign exchange
and ensures full coverage of current transactions. A more diversified supply of foreign exchange
could be achieved by relaxing surrender requirements—including those for the hydrocarbon
sector companies—and by lowering the de facto reserve requirement ratio on foreign currency
deposits of companies and individuals. Competition in the interbank market could be
strengthened by allowing private agents to place foreign exchange orders outside of the banks
that handle their international trade transactions. The authorities agreed with staff’s
recommendations and have requested IMF technical assistance to develop the foreign exchange
interbank market.



Decisive action is needed to remove the premium for foreign exchange on the parallel market.
Although foreign currency needs for current transactions are entirely covered by the BA, and the
parallel market is illegal, the premium on the parallel market remains high, at about 40 percent.
The premium is a source of distortion that impedes private sector development. The mission
reiterated its recommendation that the authorities significantly raise the indicative foreign
exchange allocation ceilings to more realistic levels. The authorities should also prepare to move
toward a gradual and properly sequenced liberalization of the capital account, taking into
account Algeria’s financial and institutional infrastructure, and starting with FDI followed by
portfolio flows.

19.
The authorities should pursue further reforms to preserve the stability of the financial
sector. The financial sector is solvent, well-capitalized, and stable. Its major vulnerability is the
concentration of credit risk. Staff welcomed the adoption of three regulations related to capital
adequacy, lending classification and provisioning, and concentration risk, which follow the 2013
Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) recommendations related to Basel II/III. The authorities
are also planning to introduce macro-prudential policies, strengthen the deposit guarantee system,
and set up a crisis management framework. A dedicated bank resolution regime needs to be
established, and the shift to risk-based supervision needs to take place by completing the CAMELS
rating exercise by 2015, as currently envisioned. Finally, reforms are needed to encourage banks to
write off old and fully provisioned NPLs. Such reforms include easing the obligation of banks to
recover these NPLs and facilitating their transfer to an asset management company.

THEME 2. ENSURING EXTERNAL STABILITY
20.
Algeria’s external position has weakened in recent years, exposing risks to external
sustainability under a no-policy-change scenario. Simulations show that, under current policies,
long-term external sustainability is compromised, as the net international investment position is
projected to turn negative when oil production ends and would later exceed 100 percent of GDP.
While fiscal consolidation and an appropriate exchange rate policy would help, staff and the
authorities agreed on the need to accelerate export growth through a two-pronged approach of
diversifying the export base and preserving hydrocarbon exports.
21.
Wide-ranging reforms are needed to spur export diversification, which is critical to
ensuring external sustainability and reducing vulnerability to oil price shocks. Available
information suggests that oil resources will be depleted by the early 2030s, and gas by the mid2050. Yet with a nonhydrocarbon export-to-import cover ratio below 2 percent, Algeria’s
dependence on hydrocarbon exports is among the highest in oil-exporting countries.
Nonhydrocarbon export capacities therefore urgently need to be expanded to cover the country’s
future imports.


Policies should focus on maintaining economic stability and improving competitiveness.
Macroeconomic policy should avoid real exchange rate overvaluation, strengthen the
profitability of domestic production, and support exports. Public spending should be directed
toward productivity-enhancing sectors, such as education and infrastructure, while salary
increases should be kept in line with productivity gains.



Diversification requires trade and FDI openness. Trade openness supports diversification through
the lower cost of inputs, the incorporation of technical progress through imports, and
competition. Staff welcomed the authorities’ announced resolve to accelerate WTO accession,
and advised increasing the number of free trade agreements to improve the country’s access to
foreign markets. In the meantime, staff underscored that trade restriction measures, such as
import or export licenses, should be avoided because they introduce distortions in the economy.
Staff reiterated its recommendation that the requirement of a minimum 51 percent Algerian
ownership in foreign investments should be eliminated or at least limited to strategic sectors.
The ongoing reform of the investment code is an opportunity to repeal this provision and give
the government more flexibility in defining limits on foreign shareholding. While the authorities
broadly agreed with staff recommendations, they prefer a gradual approach to liberalizing trade
and easing FDI restrictions.



Reforms are needed to create a more export-friendly business climate. In addition to the
constraints faced by entrepreneurs in launching and operating a business, exporters face high
trade costs, pervasive foreign exchange controls, and limits to their ability to invest overseas in
support of exports. Staff recommended eliminating or relaxing these constraints and
implementing an export promotion strategy aimed at developing capacities in areas where
Algeria has significant development potential.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ALGERIA

22.
Energy policy needs to support growth of hydrocarbon exports. This entails
implementing reforms aimed at reversing the decline in production and containing domestic
consumption.


A more attractive environment for investment in the hydrocarbon sector is needed to achieve
faster, sustained growth in production. Staff expects the downward trend that has marked
hydrocarbon production for the past eight years to start reversing in 2014. Production should
increase moderately over the medium term as new projects come on line and gas production
fully recovers from the 2013 attack on the In Amenas gas plant. However, a more robust
recovery would require a significant contribution from foreign investment, particularly because
Algeria plans to explore and develop its offshore and unconventional assets. More investment in
the hydrocarbon sector will also help extend the time horizon for hydrocarbon resources and
boost production and exports. Against the background of yet another disappointing round of
exploration tenders, staff encouraged the authorities to continue implementing reforms to
improve Algeria’s attractiveness to FDI in the energy sector and to promote exploration,
especially in the currently challenging context of lower oil prices. The authorities plan to assess
the results of the recent bid round and launch a new bid round soon, with the hope of attracting
more investors.



The rapid growth in domestic consumption, which weighs on the country’s export capacity, needs
to be contained. A gradual phasing-out of implicit subsidies for hydrocarbon products and
electricity is needed to slow down the growth of domestic consumption, including smugglingrelated leaks. Staff also encouraged the authorities to design and implement a strategy to
increase energy efficiency and develop alternative energy sources, including renewable energy,
where Algeria has considerable potential.

THEME 3. ACCELERATING ECONOMIC GROWTH AND
JOB CREATION
23.
Algeria has impressive economic potential. Fully realizing this potential will require a shift
toward a private sector-led growth model. Reforms are needed to strengthen the quality of public
investment, reduce the public sector’s footprint, promote private sector development, and foster
productivity and competitiveness. Faster growth, combined with improved labor market
effectiveness, would increase job creation.
24.
Public investment will remain a significant source of growth in coming years. In a
context of tighter financing conditions, the focus should be on efficiency. Efficiency could be
increased by adopting an integrated public financial management system, together with tools to
improve project selection, implementation, monitoring and evaluation. Staff recommended avoiding
the use of negotiated contracts and relying fully on an open and competitive process for public
investment, to enhance efficiency and transparency. The authorities should also establish a legal

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

ALGERIA

framework for public-private partnerships, which have started to be developed and could be an
efficient way to increase the supply of infrastructure.
25.
Faster and more sustainable growth will require structural reforms that transform the private
sector into an engine for growth.


The business climate needs to improve. Notwithstanding Algeria’s 21-point advance (to
79th place) in the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness ranking, the business climate
remains difficult. Staff welcomed the authorities plan to carry out an extensive program of
reforms to improve the business climate and strengthen the economy’s competitiveness, and
advised streamlining administrative procedures for creating companies, obtaining title to
property and construction permits, conducting international trade, and paying taxes. Developing
e-government solutions would help, as would putting in place effective one-stop shops and
strengthening anti-corruption efforts. Some of those improvements could be incorporated in
the upcoming overhaul of the investment code. The authorities stressed that they have already
simplified some procedures and are determined to improve Algeria’s ranking in the World
Bank’s Doing Business report.



Increasing total factor productivity growth will require wide-ranging structural reforms. In addition
to increasing openness to facilitate technological transfers, staff advised the authorities to foster
competition, design policies to promote entrepreneurship and innovation, improve the quality
of education and training, and support the development of ICT industries.

26.
Reforms are needed to develop the financial sector. The financial sector is generally
healthy but underdeveloped, which hinders private sector-led growth. Staff underscored the
importance of implementing the recommendations of the 2013 FSAP (Appendix 6), which the
authorities already consider a priority. Key reforms include:


Improving access to finance. Staff recommended strengthening competition, enhancing
creditors’ rights, modernizing the bankruptcy framework, and improving debt enforcement
procedures. The governance of state-owned banks should be improved, and the possibility of
criminal sanctions for lending decisions lifted. SME lending is impeded by high collateral
requirements and difficulties dealing with NPLs. The guarantee system has so far failed to spur
credit to SMEs and needs to be reformed. The credit registry, which is expected to be completed
in 2015, should facilitate access to information and help to unlock credit. The lifting of the ban
on consumer lending announced in the 2015 budget law is welcome. Staff also recommended
that the government withdraw from direct mortgage financing, particularly for middle- and
upper-income households, in order to facilitate the development of housing credit. To develop
the payment system, the public sector should take a leading role in the use of banking
payments.



Developing capital markets. Underdeveloped markets deprive savers of investment opportunities
and limit businesses’ access to capital. Staff recommended swift implementation of the
government’s program to open up the capital of some large state-owned enterprises. In

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ALGERIA

addition, the authorities should modify existing regulations to eliminate the government’s right
of first refusal and to define a threshold for the requirement of having to obtain prior agreement
from the BA to participate in a bank’s capital. To develop local debt markets, sovereign bond
issuance should be increased and existing disincentives to corporate securities issuance, such as
interest rate subsidies, should be removed.


Addressing gaps in the anti-money laundering and financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) framework. In
October 2014, the FATF concluded that Algeria had not made sufficient progress in
implementing its action plan, and that strategic AML/CFT deficiencies remained, in terms of the
criminalization of terrorist financing, freezing of terrorist assets, and customer due diligence
requirements. Staff urged the authorities—and the authorities agreed—to address FATF’s
remaining concerns to avoid potential countermeasures and further economic impact of
heightened due diligence on cross-border transactions.

27.
Further progress in reducing unemployment will require not only more labor-intensive
economic growth, but also better functioning labor markets. Labor market performance
continues to be disappointing, with unemployment stabilizing at a relatively high level, low rates of
participation and employment, and a sizeable informal sector.


High transaction costs in the formal labor market slow job creation and encourage the
development of the informal sector. Algeria’s labor market is characterized by rigidities in terms
of hiring and firing, high payroll taxes and excessive growth in wages with respect to
productivity. Unemployment insurance is ineffective because of overly strict rules governing the
collection of unemployment benefits. Labor market rigidities mean that firms have limited scope
to adjust to changes in demand. For example, adjusting hours worked to seasonal changes in
production is not allowed—contrary to the case in 93 percent of countries. Staff recommended
reviewing labor market regulations and the cost-effectiveness of social protection, especially in
order to facilitate the reallocation of labor to productive activities while enhancing protection for
the risk of unemployment and income shocks. The authorities stated that they are reviewing the
labor code with other stakeholders and intend to move in the direction recommended by staff.



The mismatch between labor demand and supply needs to be addressed. There is evidence that
employers have difficulties in finding applicants with an adequate level of technical or job skills.
The authorities should develop a strategy for education and training to meet labor market
needs. Ties between the educational system and the private sector should be strengthened, and
the appeal to students of vocational training programs improved. Finally, the public sector needs
to move away from its traditional role of employer of first choice in order to make employment
in the private sector more attractive.



The net impact of active labor market policies on employment should be assessed to guide future
policy. Active labor market policies have focused mainly on supporting the creation of small
enterprises, but the evaluation of those policies is still limited. A preliminary study of the
national unemployment insurance fund (Caisse Nationale d’Assurance Chômage, CNAC)
suggests that those enterprises have a relatively high survival rate but very limited growth.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

ALGERIA

A significant number of enterprises have been created with support from the national youth
unemployment agency (Agence Nationale de Soutien à l’Emploi, ANSEJ), but there are also
indications that NPLs have rapidly accumulated. Staff underscored that other active labor market
policies could be usefully explored, such as training programs for low-skilled, vulnerable youth.
The authorities should conduct a rigorous evaluation of active labor market policies to improve
their effectiveness, and move towards a more targeted approach. The authorities indicated that
they are in the process of carrying out an evaluation of the schemes that support
entrepreneurship among the unemployed.


Women continue to be underrepresented in the labor market. Female participation rates remain
low, and women’s unemployment rate is higher than men’s. Women with jobs are more likely
than men to be covered by social security, but they are also more likely to work on a part-time
basis. In recent years, considerable progress has been made to improve parity between men and
women in education, but this progress has yet to translate into significant improvement in
female participation and employment rates. Economic and social policies can help—for example,
improving transportation, increasing the availability of child care, and introducing greater
flexibility in working arrangements.

STAFF APPRAISAL
28.
Algeria’s longstanding vulnerabilities are becoming increasingly apparent, exposing
the unsustainable nature of current policies and increasing the urgency for reforms. Economic
growth is expected to pick up in 2014, inflation has fallen below the central bank’s target, and fiscal
and external buffers remain large. However, current policies are unsustainable and have increased
Algeria’s vulnerability to oil price shocks. The current account is expected to record a deficit this year
and through the medium term, the fiscal deficit is widening, and both fiscal savings and foreign
exchange reserves are declining in absolute terms. These trends are expected to continue unless
major reforms are undertaken to restore fiscal sustainability, diversify the economy, improve
competitiveness, reduce dependence on hydrocarbon exports, and promote private sector-led
growth.
29.
Monetary policy should guard against possible renewed inflationary pressures. Strong
credit growth, a surge in capital spending, the possibility of further wage increases, and an upturn in
excess liquidity suggest that inflationary pressures could reemerge. The BA should use interest rates
more actively and should continue to mop up excess liquidity, including by issuing central bank bills.
The Ministry of Finance can limit liquidity injections by relying more on debt issuance and less on
drawing from the FRR to finance the budget.
30.
The widening of the fiscal deficit this year further undermines fiscal sustainability.
Placing fiscal policy on a sustainable path will require ambitious and sustained fiscal consolidation.
Staff recommends the adoption of a fiscal rule to help with this effort while reducing procyclicality.
Fiscal consolidation will require mobilizing more nonhydrocarbon revenue and containing current
expenditures—especially wages and transfers. Subsidies are costly and inefficient, and should be

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ALGERIA

gradually replaced by a better-targeted cash transfer system. The authorities’ intention to move to a
medium-term budget framework and program budgeting is a welcome development, and should be
supported by a sound integrated public financial management system.
31.
Ensuring external sustainability will require boosting hydrocarbon exports and
developing a more diversified export base. Algeria needs to attract foreign investment to expand
oil and gas reserves and enhance production capacity. At the same time, raising the prices of
hydrocarbon products and electricity is necessary to contain the growth of domestic consumption,
which is weighing on hydrocarbon exports. In order to diversify its exports, Algeria should avoid
exchange rate overvaluation, create a more export-friendly business climate, and foster more trade
and capital openness.
32.
The financial sector is generally healthy but underdeveloped. The transition to Basel II/III
for supervision is welcome. The authorities should continue to implement the recommendations of
the 2013 FSAP mission, especially accelerating the shift to risk-based supervision, developing
financial safety nets, and setting up a crisis management framework. Reforms are needed to
improve access to finance, especially for SMEs and households. Listing well-performing public
companies would help to develop the stock exchange. To develop local debt markets, sovereign
bond issuance should be increased and interest subsidies removed. Remaining shortcomings in the
AML/CFT framework must be addressed to avoid potential countermeasures by FATF members.
33.
Realizing Algeria’s impressive economic potential will require wide-ranging reforms.
The efficiency of public investment could be increased by developing tools to improve project
selection, implementation, monitoring and evaluation, and by setting up a legal framework for
public-private partnerships. To transform the private sector into an engine for growth, the business
climate needs to improve. The authorities should also increase international openness so as to
facilitate technological transfers and foster competition, and design policies to promote
entrepreneurship and innovation, improve the quality of education and training, and support the
development of ICT.
34.
Labor market reforms are needed to reduce unemployment, especially among youth
and women. Labor market regulations are overly rigid, limiting firms’ ability to react to changes in
demand. Closer ties between the educational system and the private sector would help ensure that
graduates are equipped with the skills that firms are seeking. The authorities should undertake a
thorough assessment of active labor market policies to gauge their effectiveness. Preliminary
indications suggest that these policies have led to little job creation. Although progress has been
made to improve parity between men and women in education, more needs to be done to increase
female participation and employment rates.
35.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month
cycle.

Appendix I. External Sector Assessment
Algeria’s external position is highly vulnerable to a sustained decline in oil prices. Despite
efforts to diversify, Algeria’s external position is determined largely by the performance of

The real effective exchange rate stabilized in the first months of 2014 compared to its 2013
level. Following a 5.3 percent depreciation

effective exchange rate appreciated again in

Real
December 2013 and January 2014, before
105
oscillating over the first half of 2014. Over the
100
first seven months of 2014, the nominal
effective exchange rate depreciated slightly
95
(0.3 percent) on average compared to the same
period in 2013, while the average real effective
90
exchange rate depreciation reached
0.9 percent.
Source: Algerian authorities.
The real exchange rate assessment is based on two methodologies:


The equilibrium real effective exchange rate methodology, which estimates the equilibrium
exchange rate as a function of a set of medium-term fundamentals, and derives the exchange
rate adjustment needed to restore equilibrium over the medium term. The equilibrium real
effective exchange rate model was reestimated in 2014 (see Box).



The EBA-lite methodology, which estimates a country’s current account norm based on
economic fundamentals, cyclical factors, and desirable policy levels. The exchange rate

misalignment is then derived as the adjustment necessary to bring the actual current account
balance to its norm, using a calculated elasticity.1
Both methodologies suggest that the real exchange rate is on the strong side:


The equilibrium real exchange rate methodology (both the old and newly estimated models)
suggests that the real effective exchange rate in 2014 was overvalued by about 3.4 percent and
by over 10 percent compared to its medium-term equilibrium value.



The EBA-lite methodology, which estimates the misalignment in 2013, also suggests a real
effective exchange rate on the strong side. There are no significant domestic policy gaps; the
1.1 percent policy gap that contributes to the current account gap is mainly driven by global
policy gaps.

New Estimates of the Equilibrium Real Effective Exchange Rate for Algeria
Models used to assess the level of the real exchange rate need to be updated on a regular basis. This
is particularly important in Algeria, where the BA’s exchange rate policy targets the equilibrium level of the
real effective exchange rate. Against this background, staff updated and developed the existing exchange
rate assessment framework.

The 2014 update of the model is estimated over 1990-2013.1 The real effective exchange rate is
explained by the relative productivity of Algeria compared to its main export partners (RELPROD); terms of
trade (TOT); the country’s openness ratio (OPEN); and the share of public spending in GDP (SPEND), with the
following coefficients (all significant at the 1 percent level, except for the terms of trade):

Consistent with the existing literature, an increase in relative productivity is related to an appreciation of the
real effective exchange rate (Balassa-Samuelson effect); an increase in public spending leads to a real
equilibrium appreciation; an increase in openness is related to a depreciation of the currency. Terms of trade
increases have an unexpected but statistically non significant negative relation to the real exchange rate.

The analysis is complemented with a paneldata estimation of the real effective exchange
rate, run on 31 MCD countries over 1990-2013. A
panel data approach has the advantage of
estimating the typical reaction of the real effective
exchange rate to a range of determinants across
multiple countries, and can serve as a useful check
for the results of an Algeria-specific model. The
panel data approach proposed is a useful tool for
verifying that the exchange rate is not departing in
a systematic way from the behavior suggested by
the average behavior in the sample. The model
tests the behavior of the real effective exchange
rate against current and capital spending, relative
productivity, terms of trade, reserves and changes
in NFA. The analysis broadly confirms that the
dinar has remained close to its fundamental value,
pointing, depending on the estimated
specification, to some strength toward the end of
the estimation period.

Appendix II. How Effective Are Generalized Subsidies?
Over the years, Algeria has developed a generous system of subsidies. Those range from implicit subsidies
on hydrocarbon products to price controls on some products (such as wheat for bread or powdered milk) to
price regulation mechanisms (for oil and sugar). These subsidies—especially the subsidies on basic food
products—benefit the poorest. However, because they are not targeted, generalized subsidies also support
consumption by the highest quintiles of the income distribution, which consume considerably larger quantities
of both hydrocarbon products and food than does the poorest quintile, and thus constitute an inefficient and
costly approach to reducing poverty.
Although food subsidies reach the poorest, they disproportionately benefit the better-off and therefore
represent a significant cost to the community. Because the lowest quintile consumption structure is tilted
towards food items, subsidies do provide purchasing power support to the poorest segment of the population.
At the same time, the largest part of subsidized products is consumed by the highest quintile, which therefore
reaps the greatest benefits from the existing subsidies

The level of detail currently available does not allow to identify precisely the subsidized products. The extent
of the subsidy is therefore lower than the share of the broad categories in consumption.

Appendix III. Improving Algeria’s Investment Efficiency
Like other oil-exporting countries in the MENA region, Algeria took advantage of strong revenues from
rising oil prices over the past decade to scale up public investment. Public investment rose from
7.8 percent of GDP in 2000 to a peak of 19.5 percent in 2009. It has since declined to 11.4 percent, giving way
increasingly to current expenditures, but remains well above the average in MCD countries and higher than the
average in emerging market and developing economies. High levels of public investment are needed to
address infrastructure gaps and enhance economic growth prospects. Ianchovichina and others (2013)
estimate that non-GCC oil exporters in the MENA region will need almost 11 percent of GDP per annum to
maintain and improve their infrastructure.

High levels of public investment call for more focus on investment efficiency. Increased public
investment, while appropriate, has contributed to a weaker fiscal position and exacerbated Algeria’s
vulnerability to a decline in oil prices. In this context, improving the efficiency of public investment should be a
policy priority. Higher investment efficiency would help address infrastructure gaps faster and would boost
growth dividends. Improving investment efficiency is especially critical given Algeria’s relatively short time
horizon for hydrocarbon resources and the need for public investment to support the diversification of
production and export.
Algeria’s investment efficiency is relatively weak. Albino-War and others (2014) use efficiency frontier
2

analysis to assign investment efficiency scores to individual countries. The investment efficiency score reflects
how far a country is from the frontier determined by the best performers. Efficiency is measured in terms of
both the quality (measured with the infrastructure sub-component of the global competitiveness indicator of

the World Economic Forum) and the quantity (measured as an index of physical infrastructure) of
infrastructure. According to this methodology, Algeria’s investment efficiency is weak compared to other oil
exporters in the region and well below the global average. It also ranks well below commodity exporters with
strong institutions (as measured by the World Bank’s Worldwide Governance Indicators), indicating that high
public investment efficiency is generally associated with good institutional quality. Algeria’s investment
efficiency score of 0.29 (in terms of investment quantity) suggests that, under ideal circumstances, Algeria
could have built up to 71 percent more infrastructure with the same amount of investment.

To increase investment efficiency, Algeria needs to improve public financial management. The
authorities need to improve the selection and budgeting process (objectives, costs, ex-ante assessment), as
well as the implementation and ex-post evaluation of investment projects (open and transparent procurement,
physical and financial monitoring, ex-post assessment). An assessment of infrastructure needs and an in-depth
assessment of the management framework for public investment, supported by development partners such as
the World Bank, should be given priority.
Over the medium term, the focus should be on revamping the overall framework for managing public
expenditure. Algeria’s intention to move to a medium-term budget framework and result-oriented budget
programs is critical for addressing fiscal vulnerabilities and aligning investment projects with strategic
government priorities. In addition, the government should foster a public debate about government
investment decisions. These reforms will require capacity building to ensure effective implementation of the
new framework for managing public investment.

1/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms, g = real GDP growth rate,
e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and rising inflation (based
on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels
of the last projection year.

B. Nonfinancial Relations
Exchange Rate Arrangement
1.
From January 21, 1974 to October 1, 1994, the exchange rate of the dinar was determined
on the basis of a fixed relationship with a basket of currencies, adjusted from time to time. On
October 1, 1994, the Bank of Algeria introduced a managed float for the dinar through daily fixing
sessions that included six commercial banks. This system has been replaced by an interbank foreign
exchange market as of January 2, 1996. On November 5, 2014, the average of the buying and selling
rates for the U.S. dollar was US$ 1 = DZD 84.02, equivalent to SDR 1 = DZD 123.47. No margin limits
are imposed on the buying and selling exchange rates in the interbank foreign exchange market,
except for a margin of DA 0.015 between the buying and selling rates of the Bank of Algeria for the
dinar against the U.S. dollar.
2.
The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating and the de facto exchange
regime is classified as other managed arrangement with no preannounced path for the exchange
rate. Algeria maintains an exchange system free from restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers for current international transactions.
Latest Article IV Consultation
The discussions for the 2013 Article IV consultation with Algeria were held in Algiers during
November 12-25, 2013. The consultation was concluded without a meeting on January 27, 2013. The

STATISTICAL ISSUES
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance.
National Accounts: Following STA recommendations, the NSO is now compiling annual national
accounts (ANA) at prior year prices. The ANA broadly follow the 1993 SNA recommendations, but
nonprofit institutions serving households are not taken into account. Work is ongoing to compile
quarterly national accounts.
Price Statistics: Data are published with a delay of less than one month.
Government finance statistics: Key shortcomings include insufficient institutional coverage
(coverage is limited to Budgetary Central Government, albeit in a wide sense, including the general
budget, the annexed budget, and the special treasury accounts), classification problems, long lags for
production of statistics, and lack of reconciliation of financing with the monetary accounts. Key
factors behind these weaknesses include the lack of financial resources allocated to the compilation
of statistics, insufficient interagency coordination, and concern about accuracy that give rise to
reluctance to publish provisional data.

Monetary statistics: Monetary statistics compiled by the authorities are largely in line with the
methodology in the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual, 2000 and its companion Compilation
Guide, 2008. Timeliness of reporting by state-owned commercial banks has significantly improved
over the last two years; consequently, data on depository corporations—as well as finance
companies—are usually available within a period of two to three months. Reporting formats (balance
sheet and appendices) applied to commercial banks and finance companies were updated in 2009
and the updated version was enforced in 2010. All respondents now provide all requested data, thus
making the monetary statistics more meaningful than before. Data on insurance corporations are not
yet collected, but the Banque d'Algérie, with the continuing support of the IMF Statistics
Department, launched in 2009 a project to this end.

Balance of payments: Balance of payments statistics are generally of good quality. International
investment position data are not available, mainly because of capacity issues in compiling FDI stocks.
An STA mission will visit Algiers in September to support the authorities in building BPM6-compliant
IIP data.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Algeria began participation in the General Data
Dissemination System (GDDS) on April 21, 2009.

No data ROSC is available.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with Algeria

On December 1, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with Algeria.
Economic activity has picked up in 2014, with real GDP growth projected to reach 4.0 percent
following 2.8 percent growth in 2013. The hydrocarbon sector is expected to expand for the first
time in eight years, while nonhydrocarbon growth remains supportive. Inflation has decelerated
sharply to 2.1 percent, thanks in part to tighter monetary policy.
Algeria continues to enjoy substantial external and fiscal buffers, but threats to macroeconomic
stability are growing. For the first time in nearly 15 years, the current account is expected to
record a deficit. Deficits are projected to widen over the medium term, as strong domestic
hydrocarbon consumption and lower oil prices weigh on exports, while imports continue to
grow, driven by public spending. The export base is undiversified, and Foreign Direct
Investment (FDI) is hampered by restrictions on ownership.
The fiscal deficit is expected to widen to over 7 percent due to lower hydrocarbon revenue, a
sharp increase in capital expenditure, and continued high current spending. Nonhydrocarbon
revenues are below their potential, the wage bill is high, and subsidies and transfers are costly,
amounting to about 26 percent of GDP. Fiscal savings are expected to decline for the second
consecutive year.
Although Algeria has enjoyed macroeconomic stability, faster and more inclusive growth is
necessary to provide enough jobs for the country’s youthful population. Public investment
efficiency is low, and private sector growth is hindered by a cumbersome business climate, an
underdeveloped financial sector, and limited international integration. Finally, rigidities in the
labor market and skills mismatches reduce the impact of economic growth on job creation.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed the rebound in economic activity, the further decline in inflation,
and the sizeable policy buffers. At the same time, Directors noted increasing vulnerabilities
against the backdrop of falling oil prices, from the deterioration of the fiscal and current accounts
and the decline in fiscal savings and foreign exchange reserves. They called for prompt action to
preserve macroeconomic stability, complemented with broad-based reforms to diversify the
economy, enhance competitiveness, and promote inclusive growth and job creation.
Directors underscored the need for sustained fiscal consolidation anchored in credible fiscal rules
to address the growing fiscal deficit and ensure fiscal sustainability. They saw scope to increase
non-hydrocarbon revenues, by broadening the tax base, strengthening tax administration, and
reducing tax exemptions. On the expenditure side, further efforts are needed to contain current
spending, including the wage bill, and to gradually replace subsidies with a targeted cash-transfer
system to protect the poor. Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to move to a
medium-term budget framework and continue to strengthen public financial management. A few
pointed to the merits of establishing a sovereign wealth fund with oil savings aimed at supporting
economic stabilization efforts and ensuring intergenerational equity.
Given the risk that inflationary pressures could reemerge, Directors encouraged the monetary
authorities to remain prudent and stand ready to increase liquidity absorption and interest rates.
They supported increasing the issuance of treasury bills to help mop up liquidity, reducing the
need to use the oil savings fund for budget financing while also deepening the capital market.
Directors welcomed the planned development of new monetary policy instruments, with Fund
assistance, for liquidity management.
Directors agreed that safeguarding external stability is a priority, and requires an effective
strategy aimed at diversifying the export base while enhancing the export capacity of the
hydrocarbon sector. They recommended greater efforts to increase trade openness, relax
restrictions on foreign direct investment, and create a more export-friendly business climate.
They also welcomed the authorities’ commitment to allow the exchange rate to reflect
fundamentals.
Directors highlighted the importance of broader structural reforms to accelerate private-sectorled growth and further reduce unemployment. These include reforms to improve infrastructure,
productivity, and public investment efficiency. Directors also encouraged further efforts to relax
labor market regulations, address skills mismatch, and promote female and youth employment. A

Statement by Jafar Mojarrad, Executive Director for Algeria;
and Kamel Badsi, Advisor
December 1, 2014
Our Algerian authorities thank staff for a constructive report and a useful Selected Issues
Paper (SIP). They highly value the Fund’s policy advice and support to their policies and
reforms, and are appreciative of its technical assistance.
Since the last Article IV consultation, Algeria has been striving to preserve
macroeconomic stability, achieve sustainable growth and employment creation, and
strengthen the resilience of its economy. After averaging 3 percent in 2012–2013, growth
is expected to increase to 4 percent in 2014 and over the medium term. While nonhydrocarbon GDP growth has remained buoyant, reaching 7 percent in 2012 and 2013,
activity in the hydrocarbon sector has declined in 2013, but is expected to pick up from
2014. Although still high among youth and women, the unemployment rate has been
gradually decreasing from a peak of 30 percent in 2000 to 9.8 percent in 2013. Inflation
dropped sharply from 8.9 percent in 2012 to 3.3 percent in 2013, which is lower than the
floor of the medium-term objective adopted by the Council of Money and Credit.
Inflation has maintained its downward trend, reaching 1.5 percent in August 2014.
External and fiscal buffers at end-2014 are large, with foreign exchange reserves
covering more than 32 months of imports and gross public debt estimated at less than
9 percent of GDP, while accumulated savings in the stabilization fund (FRR) amount to
27 percent of GDP. Despite the sharp downturn in oil prices, our authorities remain
committed to preserving macroeconomic stability as a matter of priority.
Significant fiscal adjustment was made in 2013, despite the decline in hydrocarbon
revenue, with the overall deficit falling to 1.5 percent of GDP from 5 percent of GDP in
2012. Cuts in current expenditures accounted for 2/3 of the 7 percent of GDP reduction in
expenditures, with capital spending accounting for the remaining 1/3, mainly reflecting
limited implementation capacity. In 2014, however, the deficit is expected to widen,
largely reflecting lower hydrocarbon revenue and the sharp increase in capital spending
following accelerated payments under the public investment program (PIP) 2009–2014.
A new PIP covering the period 2015–2019 is under preparation with the objective of
supporting growth with due consideration to macroeconomic stability, while ensuring
more efficiency in public investment.
The authorities are fully aware of the increasing uncertainties surrounding the sharp fall
in oil prices. Against this background, they are ready to prepare a series of measures to
mitigate the likely fiscal impact by further streamlining current spending and
strengthening tax collection. They are also cognizant of the need to deepen structural
reforms to support fiscal consolidation, including by improving spending efficiency and

2
reducing fiscal rigidities. In this regard, Fund technical assistance to the Ministry of
Finance on fiscal rules, multiyear budgeting, investment spending management, and the
organic budget law (OBL) will support the authorities’ efforts to strengthen the fiscal
framework.
The authorities fully agree on the adverse impact of wage increases and back payments,
and concur with staff recommendations in this area. However, it should be noted that the
back payments process ended in 2013, and the adverse effects arising from the 2012 civil
service reform have dissipated earlier than expected, as reflected in the absence of second
round effects on inflation. As a consequence, after a slight increase in 2015, the wage bill
as a share of GDP is projected to be on a declining trend over the medium term. The
authorities are keenly aware of the need to rethink the subsidy system and carry out a
comprehensive reform. To this effect, they appreciate the recent Fund technical
assistance, which will help them identify an optimal strategy to carry out a smooth exit
from the current subsidy regime, while strengthening the social safety net. The authorities
attach high priority to strengthening tax administration and building capacity in support
of the ongoing tax policy reform, which aims at fighting tax evasion and avoidance, while
reducing the burden on taxpayers, in particular SMEs, through simplification of
procedures and unification of tax regulations within a single tax code.
Against a backdrop of continuous excess liquidity, the authorities remain committed to
maintaining a prudent monetary policy and containing inflation around the 4 percent
target. Steady enhancement of liquidity management under available monetary policy
instruments has been successful in bringing inflation down from a peak of 8.9 percent in
2012 to 3.3 percent in 2013, and has also significantly improved the inflation outlook,
with stable medium-term inflation expectations. Moreover, in close coordination with the
Central Bank, the Finance Ministry is committed to further issuing treasury bills, while
limiting recourse to the FRR, thereby contributing to absorbing excess liquidity. Going
forward, with IMF technical assistance, the Bank of Algeria intends to develop new
monetary policy instruments, including central bank securities, in order to better manage
liquidity and deepen the money market. The authorities take positive note of staff’s
assessment that the real effective exchange rate (REER) of the Algerian Dinar is broadly
in line with fundamentals.
As evidenced by the financial soundness indicators, the banking system is well
capitalized, liquid, and profitable. Over the five past years, the NPL ratio declined by
50 percent to reach 10.5 percent in 2013. It should be noted that NPLs largely relate to
old private debts, which are fully provisioned. Banking supervision has been steadily
strengthened with Fund and World Bank technical assistance. The CAMELS rating
system will be generalized to all banks in 2015, and new regulations related to capital
adequacy, loan classification and provisioning, and concentration of risk have been
recently adopted by the Council of Money and Credit. The implementation of the

3
upgraded credit registry will be completed in 2015, and would coincide with the
reactivation of consumer lending activity.
In the authorities’ view, economic diversification is crucial to ensure high and sustainable
growth and job creation. They are committed to laying the foundations for strong privatesector-led growth, and are working to foster an attractive business climate and facilitate
foreign investment. In this regard, efforts are underway to identify the main impediments
to investment, in close collaboration with all stakeholders. Significant progress has being
made in reducing administrative costs, shortening delays for building permits,
modernizing the judiciary system, and improving access to land. A new draft bill is being
prepared to promote investment, and new provisions facilitating investment abroad by
resident companies have been recently introduced.
