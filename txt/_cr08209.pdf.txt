Executive Summary
Senegal’s macroeconomic performance improved in 2007, broadly in line with program
projections. While economic growth recovered, rapidly rising food and energy prices raised
inflation and put pressure on the fiscal and external accounts.
Although the headline overall fiscal deficit declined and the program target on the basic
fiscal balance was met, there were fiscal slippages in 2007. The authorities committed
more spending than the program envisaged, partly for food and energy subsidies, and
postponed to 2008 the issuance of payment orders equivalent to 2 percent of GDP, delaying
payments to the private sector. In addition, there is a possibility that extrabudgetary spending
of about 0.2 percent of GDP may have occurred.
Aside from this fiscal issue, Senegal performed well under the PSI. All structural
conditionality was respected (albeit one measure only partially), and all quantitative
assessment criteria were met except the zero ceiling on domestic arrears, which was
exceeded for the first three weeks after the program began. Because corrective action was
prompt, the staff supports the authorities’ request for a waiver.
Senegal’s economic outlook remains positive, although downside risks have increased.
Economic growth could accelerate slightly and the external current account deficit stabilize,
with its financing being increasingly provided by FDI. Inflation should return to its historic
average once price pressures on food and energy products abate.
The authorities agreed with the staff’s analysis that structural reforms will be key to
raising external competitiveness and helping turn around Senegal’s long-standing poor
export performance. The real exchange rate seems to be in line with economic
fundamentals.
The PSI’s fiscal program aims to correct past fiscal slippages, preserve debt
sustainability, contribute to domestic stability, and restore the integrity of the budget
framework. The authorities need to revisit their system of food and energy subsidies to bring
it in line with budgetary affordability, improve its targeting, and limit economic distortions.
The program’s structural measures will focus on fiscal governance and transparency and help
shore up fiscal policy against a variety of risks, including from the planned special economic
zone.
On balance, the staff recommends completion of the first PSI program review.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Senegal faces important macroeconomic challenges which it has begun to
address under an economic program supported by the three-year PSI approved in
November 2007. These challenges were identified during the 2006 Article IV consultation
discussions and became the pillars of the PSI: (i) reversing the rising trend in the fiscal deficit
to underpin macroeconomic stability and safeguard debt sustainability; (ii) improving fiscal
governance and transparency so as to enhance policy credibility and sustain external
assistance; (iii) encouraging private sector activity by improving the business environment
and addressing structural impediments to higher economic growth; and (iv) limiting financial
sector vulnerabilities and raising the sector’s contribution to the economy.
2.
The PSI is off to a broadly satisfactory start but new challenges have emerged. It
enjoys strong political support and has served its intended role of providing a framework for
economic policymaking and reassuring donors. However, the international environment has
become more challenging in recent months, including through the more subdued world
growth outlook, the turbulence in financial markets, and, in particular, the sharp rise in food
and energy prices. The latter has triggered street demonstrations and forced the government
to adopt countervailing measures. These measures, together with investment spending
pressures and problems controlling spending near year-end, significantly affected budget
execution in 2007 and limit the government’s room for maneuver going forward.
II. HIGHER ECONOMIC GROWTH BUT WORRISOME SURGE IN FOOD AND ENERGY PRICES
3.
The Senegalese economy rebounded in 2007, broadly in line with the projections
underlying the program (Figure 1).
•

Economic growth. Buoyant activity in the services and construction sectors raised
GDP growth to 4¾ percent in 2007, from 2¼ percent in 2006 (Table 1). However, for
the second year in a row, agricultural output declined.

•

Inflation. Rapidly rising energy and food prices raised inflation and put pressure on
the external and fiscal accounts. Inflation reached 6 percent, the highest level since
the 1994 devaluation. The authorities suspended VAT and customs duties on certain
food products in mid-2007, gradually raised the subsidy on butane gas, and
introduced subsidies on petroleum products in late 2007. This may have temporarily
restrained inflation and helped maintain social peace, but the budgetary costs were
substantial, at 1½ percent of GDP.

•

Balance of payments and external debt. The increase in the external current account
deficit to 10½ percent of GDP reflected rising energy and food imports, while exports
remained stagnant on account of the delayed restructuring of the phosphate

company ICS (Table 2). 1 Capital inflows increased due to higher foreign direct
investment (FDI) and receipts from the sale of a third telecom license, which helped
keep external debt indicators stable relative to 2006.
•

Fiscal policy. The headline overall fiscal deficit, defined on a payment order basis,
was kept at 3½ percent of GDP in 2007, compared with 6 percent of GDP a year
before (Tables 3 and 4). However, unsettled expenditure commitments equivalent to
2 percent of GDP need to be carried over to 2008, causing significant delays in
payments to the private sector (see below). This suggests that the overall fiscal deficit
in 2007 on a commitment basis was about 5½ percent of GDP; since most of the
goods and services were delivered in 2007, this may have contributed to upward
pressure on prices in certain areas, such as construction.

•

Financial sector. While micro finance has experienced strong growth, bank credit to

concentration (Table 7).

ICS is Senegal’s largest company, but its output in 2007 was at one-third of 2005 capacity because
negotiations on its rehabilitation have been protracted (see Box 2 in IMF Country Report No. 07/358). In March
2008, a local court accepted the restructuring plan agreed between the foreign majority owner and the
government. This decision allowed the government to rescind its bank loan guarantee. Output is projected to
reach capacity by 2010.

2

WAEMU regulations require that ICS claims continue to be classified as nonperforming, but provisions will
have to be raised only if ICS has difficulties in servicing its rescheduled debt.

8
III. THE PSI—AN OVERALL GOOD PROGRAM START BUT SOME FISCAL SLIPPAGES
4.
The program has started well on the structural side (Table 9). The authorities
respected all structural conditions, although one was met partially.
•

Fiscal governance and transparency. The authorities expanded the SIGFIP software
to improve the monitoring of arrears and other payment delays; modified the legal
status of the agency (APIX) in charge of the new Dakar Integrated Special Economic
Zone (DISEZ); implemented a new public procurement framework; and completed a
study on the revenue implications of DISEZ (see Box 7 below). The 2004 and 2005
Treasury accounts have been partially submitted to the audit court, and the
submission is expected to be completed soon.

•

Private sector development. The authorities adopted a framework law and decree for
the Accelerated Growth Strategy, setting the stage for its implementation; and issued
a decree to facilitate short-term employment contracts in an effort to increase labor
market flexibility.

•

Financial sector development. The authorities submitted to Parliament the new
microfinance law that will strengthen supervision of this rapidly growing sector; 3 and
completed the study to improve accounting practices, which the 2001 and 2004
FSAPs identified as a key obstacle to financial intermediation. 4

5.
Other structural measures in the October 2007 MEFP that were not subject to
conditionality have also been put in place. Notably, the authorities followed through on
their commitments on the airport project and the DISEZ contract, which should limit fiscal
risks.
6.
The authorities met most end-2007 quantitative targets (Table 8). The continuous
quantitative assessment criterion on domestic arrears was not respected for a three-week
period immediately after the PSI was approved. The authorities quickly eliminated all such
arrears by end-November when they became aware of the nonobservance, and request a
waiver. In the staff’s view, the quick corrective action taken and the nonrecurrence of arrears
since then form a good basis for supporting the waiver. The indicative ceiling on the share of
single-tender public contracts was slightly exceeded in the last quarter of 2007, although
single tenders declined substantially from earlier in the year. 5

3

Microfinance accounts for one-tenth of private sector credit.

4

Some 80 percent of loan applications are currently rejected by banks, with difficulties in securing and
enforcing collateral and low accounting quality being cited as main reasons.

5

The share of single tenders surged again in early 2008, as ministries and agencies took advantage of the
complementary period to issue such tenders related to lines in the 2007 budget.

9
7.
While the basic fiscal balance target was met, the surge in unsettled expenditure
commitments raises concerns. 6 The authorities committed more capital and current
spending than envisaged under the program and warranted in light of Senegal’s
macroeconomic circumstances and financing constraints. In addition, they did not react
through compensating expenditure cuts to the accelerating costs of food and energy
subsidies. This necessitated an abrupt slowdown in the issuance of payment orders toward
year-end, with a concomitant rise in payment delays to the private sector. 7 There also is a
possibility that extrabudgetary spending may have occurred in 2007. The authorities agreed
to corrective actions for the first program review, as discussed below.
IV. KEY ECONOMIC CHALLENGES
A. Overview
8.
The 2008 Article IV discussions devoted particular attention to a range of
longer-term and some more immediate economic issues. 8 The emerging conclusions also
informed the selection of conditionality for the PSI program review.
•

Obstacles to raising economic growth and reducing poverty and the authorities’
multi-pronged strategy to put in place a new approach to growth were discussed from
a longer-term perspective. In this context, Senegal’s external competitiveness in light
of the continued sluggishness of exports was assessed, with a view to identifying
appropriate policy options.

•

From a more short- to medium-term perspective, the sustainability of fiscal policy in
the face of rising food and energy prices and their budgetary impact was examined. In
addition, at the request of the authorities and key donors, staff assessed the possible
revenue implications of an Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) with the EU.

6

The basic fiscal balance deviated little from what was programmed, while the overall fiscal deficit was
0.8 percent of GDP smaller than programmed. This reflects items traditionally excluded from the program
target because they (i) are beyond the authorities’ control (e.g., externally-financed investment) or (ii) need to
be shielded from spending cuts (e.g., HIPC/MDRI spending).

7

These delays do not constitute payment arrears or budgetary float under the program definition, as they
occurred before the issuance of payment orders. The program definition of the budgetary float is being adjusted
to capture these delays in the future.

8

The staff and the authorities decided to step back from the program discussions for an entire day to discuss and
reflect on these issues, based on five PowerPoint presentations given by staff.

10
B. Growth, Poverty, and Competitiveness
9.
Senegal’s overriding economic challenge is to raise growth and reduce poverty.
While growth accelerated immediately following the 1994 devaluation, in recent years trend
growth has been flat, at around 4½ percent. Yet, growth has been better in Senegal than in
other WAEMU countries. Expansion

fertilizer management. Although the
incidence of poverty fell from 68 percent in 1994–95 to 51 percent in 2005–06, it is still high,
particularly in rural areas, and several MDGs are likely to be missed (Figure 2 and Table 6).

the regional level, which found the WAEMU region’s REER not to be misaligned. Other
indicators also raise few concerns about the level of the REER. In particular, (i) Senegal’s
external debt position is sustainable (see DSA in Supplement 1), and (ii) FDI has recently
risen considerably, indicating foreign investor confidence.
Box 1. Assessment of Senegal’s REER1
Although the REER has somewhat appreciated since 2001, both the fundamental equilibrium
exchange rate (FEER) approach and the macroeconomic balance approach find the REER to be
broadly in line with its equilibrium level.
•

The FEER approach assumes that the equilibrium REER is related to a set of fundamental factors:
terms of trade, productivity, and investment. The relation between the equilibrium REER and
these fundamentals is estimated by applying four different econometric techniques. The highest
positive and negative deviations of Senegal’s actual REER from the estimated equilibrium REER
are shown below (right-hand figure). For end-2007, the deviations range from -10 percent to
+15 percent.

•

The macroeconomic balance approach estimates the REER adjustment needed to close the gap
between the projected current account (CA) balance implied by macroeconomic fundamentals
(CA norm) and the underlying CA balance which is the CA balance stripped of all temporary
factors. The analysis finds that a depreciation of less than 8 percentage points would close the gap,
but the statistical error associated with the estimation prevents a conclusive finding of
overvaluation.

11.
The authorities agreed with the staff’s REER analysis. They pointed out that
inflation in Senegal had for years been lower than in its trading partners, which provided a
buffer to help absorb the recent nominal appreciation.
12.
Although there is no conclusive evidence that the REER is overvalued, Senegal’s
export performance has been poor (Figure 3). Net exports have contributed negatively to
growth over the last few years, and the near-suspension of ICS’s operations depressed
exports in 2006–07. More generally, exports are concentrated in products that have faced a
difficult demand situation and relatively low price increases. There appear to be significant
obstacles to the production of diverse and high-quality products at low cost (Box 2). These
are being addressed under the authorities’ new approach to growth.
Box 2. Structural Impediments to Higher Competitiveness1
Survey-based indicators rank Senegal among the least competitive countries.
•

Senegal ranks 100 out of 131 countries in the 2007–08 Global Competitiveness Index;
the survey identifies a need for Senegal to enhance labor market efficiency, develop
financial markets, and invest in health and education.

•

The World Bank’s 2007–08 Doing Business Index ranks Senegal 162 out of 178
countries; starting a business, registering property, protecting investors, and obtaining
credit were seen as the main problems.

•

The Bank’s 2007 Governance Indicators highlight the need for Senegal to tackle
corruption and improve administrative efficiency.

The authorities’ new approach to growth is intended to increase the economy’s
growth potential. It centers on improving the business environment and financial
intermediation, diversifying and strengthening exports, improving infrastructure and the
energy sector, and reforming the labor market—which suffers from multiple ills. 1 It aims to
increase capital and labor utilization and spur productivity growth through the following
efforts.

The Accelerated Growth Strategy (AGS). Adopted in 2007, it has now been passed
into law and the implementation decree has been issued (an end-January 2008

The Bank’s 2007 Country Economic Memorandum (Senegal—Looking for Work—The Road to Prosperity)
analyzes these problems in great detail. Among other things, skill levels in the economy are low and labor
regulations onerous. Proposed reforms include enhancing education and training and increasing the flexibility of
labor regulations, such as with respect to fixed-term contracts (an end-March 2008 PSI benchmark).

structural benchmark). It focuses on improving the business climate in general and
developing specific export sectors. 2
•

Government spending. The authorities aim to channel spending toward areas
conducive to growth, such as investment (see Box 3), health, and education. Public
investment rose from 6 percent of GDP to 11½ percent of GDP over the past decade
and is expected to hover around 12 percent of GDP henceforth. The authorities
reiterated their intention to achieve the PRSP target of social spending equal to 40
percent of total spending by 2010.

•

Energy sector reform. The reform recently agreed by the authorities and key
development partners should help end energy supply disruptions and the sector’s drag
on the budget. 3 It aims to (i) restructure and recapitalize the sector, refine pricing
formulas, and cut costs; (ii) improve investment planning; and (iii) strengthen the
regulatory framework, foster private sector participation, and implement transparent
procurement rules.
Box 3. The Government’s Investment Strategy
An ambitious investment policy is central to the authorities’ development strategy. Besides
boosting investment in health and education, the authorities are determined to close the
infrastructure gap in transport and energy and invest in selected sectors under their AGS.
Senegal’s second PRSP featured the large infrastructure projects that the government plans to
realize over the next few years. They include an industrial platform (now the special economic
zone), the Dakar-Diamniadio highway, and the new airport. These projects are to provide a basis for
private sector development and diversify economic activity away from the congested Dakar area.
Because they are large and expertise is limited, the authorities are welcoming public-private
partnerships (PPPs) to achieve them; the Fund recently provided technical assistance in this area.
Interest in improving public investment planning and evaluation is rising. Faced with no scaling
up of aid, limited scope to boost revenue or sell government assets, and a shallow regional financial
market, better prioritization of investment is the most promising avenue for the authorities to achieve
their development objectives. They will develop directives to improve investment planning and
evaluation (a structural assessment criterion—see below).

•

Attracting FDI. The authorities have negotiated a range of investment projects with
private foreign parties that are projected to bring in a substantial increase in FDI
(Box 4).

2

The five sectors are agro-industry, fisheries, electronic customer support services, tourism, and textiles.

3

The World Bank Board meeting to approve the energy sector development loan is expected for June 2008.

16
Box 4. FDI in Senegal
FDI could reach 6 percent of GDP annually in the medium term, quadrupling the
average of the last decade. The majority of it originates in the Middle East and India.
A significant portion of FDI is for infrastructure and tourism projects. Some US$300
million was invested in hotels and infrastructure for the summit of the Organization of Islamic
States in March 2008—which may help turn Dakar into one of Africa’s major conference
centers. Dubai World Ports will invest US$300 million through 2011 to expand the Port of
Dakar. JAFZA, another Dubai-based company, has committed to invest up to US$800 million
through 2013 to develop the special economic zone near Dakar. The authorities expect the
zone’s advanced infrastructure and tax advantages to attract additional FDI.

Exploitation of resources is also attracting investment. Arcelor-Mittal Steel purchased a 25year concession for iron ore mining in 2007. The company plans to invest US$2.2 billion to
build a new port, renovate railways, and augment health care and infrastructure in nearby
villages. The Indian fertilizer company IFFCO has boosted its participation in ICS and is to
invest up to US$200 million. In both cases, the government is a minority shareholder and will
receive a share of production.

14.
The staff concurred that these efforts could raise Senegal’s growth potential,
help reduce poverty, and strengthen external competitiveness. It welcomed the general
emphasis on investment in infrastructure, health, and education, as well as the authorities’
willingness to rely on price signals (e.g., for electricity tariffs) and involve the private sector
in developing key sectors and projects. But the staff cautioned that government support for
developing the AGS cluster sectors should be limited, subject to thorough cost-benefit
studies, and consistent with the need for fiscal prudence. The staff and the authorities agreed
that priority should generally be given to the more cross-sectoral
MEFP ¶24 (refers to
measures under the AGS aimed at improving the business environment;
relevant MEFP
paragraph)
the authorities explained the pivotal role of the Presidential Investment
4
Council in this area that was producing desired changes. Overall, the authorities were
hopeful that the reform efforts would help achieve their intended objectives and lead to a
rapid improvement in Senegal’s competitiveness rankings, similar to the recent successes of
countries like Kenya and Ghana.

As a striking example, they have reduced the time needed to start a business from 58 days to 48 hours through
a one-stop window (guichet unique).

C. Challenges to Fiscal Sustainability

Maintaining fiscal sustainability will be instrumental in promoting domestic
stability in the context of Senegal’s WAEMU membership. The commitment to fiscal
adjustment under the PSI puts Senegal on track to meet, or come close to meeting, the

This is the most extreme test test (see Supplement 1).

16.
The staff identified three distinct challenges to fiscal sustainability, which the
authorities agreed needed to be addressed proactively.
•

The effect of food and energy price increases. The support measures taken to protect
the population from those price increases crowded out the issuance of payment orders
for other spending in 2007. On recent trends, the related subsidies are projected to
reach 3 percent of GDP in 2008, or one-tenth of all spending. The staff concurred
with the authorities that some form of support is necessary in the short run to help

18
maintain social calm—which the authorities pointed to as Senegal’s most important
asset—but the authorities would need to consider affordability, aim for better
targeting, and minimize economic distortions. A February 2008 Poverty and Social
Impact Analysis (PSIA) conducted by the Fund found that existing subsidies are not
well targeted and could be improved (Box 5). The authorities were highly
appreciative of the PSIA and the discussion on alternative policy options and
indicated they would explore them. They also explained their plans to improve the
supply, and lower the costs, of food and energy products. They intend to expand
domestic agricultural production, especially of high-yield products such as rice, by
improving rural infrastructure and expanding irrigation systems. Energy sector reform
is already relatively advanced, and related cost-cutting efforts should yield results in
the near future.
Box 5. Rising Food and Energy Prices: Policy Options1
The PSIA analyzed the consumption patterns of Senegalese households and found that
current policy measures are not well targeted.
•

Food. The support for rice appropriately benefits most the population’s two poorest
quintiles. However, for powdered milk and bread, the richer segments gain most from
the tax suspensions.

•

Energy. Richer household are most adversely affected by energy price increases, both
directly and indirectly through the effect on other consumables. The butane gas subsidy
benefits better-off households the most, while the lamp oil tax exemption is more
beneficial to the poor.

Short-term policy options include: (i) shifting subsidies from butane gas to lamp oil;
(ii) keeping some of the current tax suspensions, especially for rice; (iii) instituting a
subsidized rate for small electricity users; (iv) redirecting existing agricultural subsidies
towards increasing farm productivity and broadening rural job opportunities; and (v) targeting
relatively poor groups directly through measures such as school lunches, public works
programs, or transport subsidies. All these options should be carefully reviewed regularly to
ensure that they do not create unintended adverse behavior.
In the long run, the authorities may want to consider implementation of a conditional
cash transfer system. Such systems deliver social protection to the poor in Latin America.
They provide money to poor families conditional upon investment in human capital, such as
sending children to school or visiting health centers. The PSIA simulations show that such a
system could be more cost effective than the current measures to protect the poor in Senegal.
Donors could be approached for financial and technical support.

Prospective trade liberalization under an EPA. Staff analysis suggests that the
budgetary impact may be manageable as long as liberalization is spread over time

19
(Box 6). The authorities planned to use the results of the staff’s work in the
preparation of a common regional position.
Box 6. The Budgetary Impact of an Economic Partnership Agreement1
EPAs aim to establish free trade areas between the EU and most ACP countries,
including Senegal. The EU proposes asymmetric liberalization while preserving reciprocity: it
would dismantle all tariffs and quantitative restrictions on imports from ACP countries, while
partner countries would liberalize about 80 percent of EU imports.
Senegal has been an outspoken opponent of EPAs. Like other critics, the Senegalese
authorities have argued that EPAs would lead to significant revenue losses and undermine the
nascent industrial base of African economies. EPAs have also been criticized for neglecting
development.
The staff analysis suggests that Senegal’s low reliance on customs duties and strong tax
administration are important assets, so it can enter the EPA negotiation with confidence.
The share of customs duties in total revenues declined by half over the last decade, and the
share of EU imports in total imports has also fallen. This could limit annual EPA-related
revenue losses to 1.2 percent of GDP (6 percent of total revenue) by the end of the trade
liberalization period.
Trade liberalization should thus be phased in over 15–20 years to avoid a fiscal shock.
With a gradual approach, (i) revenue losses would average 0.3 percent of GDP annually over
the first five years and reach 1.2 percent of GDP only after 2025; (ii) any negative impact on
domestic industries would be reduced, as there would be more time to adapt to the changing
environment; (iii) the EU’s intention to provide compensation for revenue losses would be
more feasible; and (iv) greater regional integration would be facilitated. ECOWAS countries
have stated their preference to consolidate their regional trade agreement before achieving
“substantial” trade liberalization with the EU.

The revenue implications of DISEZ. While the planned special economic zone has
substantial upside potential to promote Senegal’s growth and export performance, its
downside risks need to be carefully managed. Its substantial tax incentives could
undermine Senegal’s traditionally strong tax collections, depending on whether taxes
paid by new companies offset those lost from existing Senegalese companies moving
to the zone. In addition, the roles of the tax and customs administrations in managing
the zone and designing anti-fraud measures need to be defined. Against this
background, the staff and the authorities agreed on several DISEZ-related measures
as structural conditionality for the program (see below).

which in 2008 may negatively impact
the trade balance by 1½ percent and 1¼ percent of GDP, respectively. Inflation is projected
to revert to its historical level of about 2 percent over the medium term. However, upward
pressure on world food and energy prices will likely keep inflation elevated in 2008.

18.
The external current account deficit is projected to be 11 to 12 percent of GDP
over the medium term and to be solidly financed. In addition to support from development
partners, an increasingly large share of the current account will be financed through FDI,
resulting in a comfortable level of international reserves and external debt sustainability; the
DSA points to a low risk of debt distress (Supplement 1). The surge in FDI will contribute to
the projected rise in Senegal’s investment rate. While domestic saving could gradually
benefit from greater business sector profitability—as a result of the envisaged structural
reforms—and improved financial sector intermediation—assuming that the vulnerabilities in
the financial sector are resolved—the program’s fiscal policy stance will be key to supporting
domestic saving.
19.
The medium-term outlook is subject to downside risks. A sustained reduction in
world growth and a slowing of international capital flows emanating from turmoil in global
financial markets could be detrimental—although the capital flows to Senegal largely consist
of relatively stable FDI. Second, the economy remains vulnerable to shocks, including
especially unpredictable price developments in commodities markets and adverse weather
and pest conditions affecting agriculture. Third, social and political tensions, possibly
exacerbated by food and energy price increases, could weaken the authorities’ ability to
implement their reform agenda and maintain macroeconomic stability. And fourth, if
competing demands for budgetary resources are not well managed or the crowding-out
pressure from food and energy price subsidies persists, fiscal outcomes could be less than
desirable and undermine domestic stability.

V. PROGRAM DISCUSSIONS
A. Overview
20.
The program environment has become more challenging. The rise in food and
energy prices and the need to correct last year’s fiscal slippages have complicated the
envisioned fiscal adjustment path. In addition, Senegal has pressing infrastructure needs but
faces financing constraints in the regional financial market and no scaling up of donor aid. A
one-time loosening of the zero ceiling on nonconcessional external borrowing for a specific
high-yield project is therefore appropriate.
21.
The authorities reiterated their commitment to maintain the PSI’s four pillars,
as outlined above in paragraph 1. It was agreed that the detailed October 2007 MEFP
would remain the reference point for the authorities’ reform efforts under their economic
program and be refined through a much shorter MEFP for the first program review
(Appendix I). The program’s streamlined structural component centers on measures to
enhance fiscal governance and transparency. Moreover, some modifications to the definitions
of the quantitative program targets are proposed.
B. Fiscal Policy
22.
The envisaged medium-term fiscal policy stance—a reduction in the overall
fiscal deficit during the program period to 4 percent of GDP—remains appropriate. It
will underpin fiscal sustainability, as outlined above, while generally providing sufficient
room to address Senegal’s development needs. It should also allow the
MEFP ¶9
government to further improve the composition of spending, with the aim of
achieving the PRSP target of social spending of 40 percent of total spending by 2010. By
contrast, a larger fiscal deficit

23.
Nonetheless, a fiscal deficit of 5 percent of GDP in 2008 is needed to allow for the
settlement of carryover spending from 2007. The authorities attached great importance to a
prompt settlement of these payment delays to remove the drag on the private sector. This,
together with the projected rise in food and energy subsidies, necessitates a conscientious
effort to rein in spending. To ensure that this reprioritization takes place, administrative
orders from the Prime Minister and Finance Minister were issued to limit the ability of line
ministries to commit new spending, with the former setting the reduced
MEFP ¶10
overall budgetary envelopes for both current and capital spending relative to
the 2008 budget law and the latter providing the specific budgets for each line
ministry consistent with the overall envelope; social sectors were excluded from this exercise
(prior action). The authorities also blocked commitment authorizations in the SIGFIP system
to enforce the order. This expenditure restraint should help lessen demand pressures in
certain sectors, thus contributing to macroeconomic stability.
24.
The higher fiscal deficit in 2008 does not represent a loosening of the
programmed fiscal policy stance. To the contrary, in aggregate, the combined overall fiscal
deficit for 2007 and 2008 is broadly as initially programmed, thus keeping the impact on debt
sustainability neutral.
25.
The size of the payment delays warrants a careful stocktaking on the nature of
the underlying spending, including its compliance with budgetary
MEFP ¶14
authorizations. 1 Based on a preliminary census that relied on self-reporting
by line ministries and agencies, spending equivalent to 0.2 percent of GDP—
apparently taken before the program start—was not immediately attributable to existing
budget lines. This raises the specter that some of this spending was extrabudgetary. In light
of this, the authorities committed to a comprehensive audit by the Inspection Générale des
Finances by end-September 2008 to gain a full understanding of all payment delays
(structural benchmark). While the backlog of bills should considerably be reduced by then,
the audit would lay the basis for a complete and permanent return to normalcy. The
authorities agreed that any unauthorized spending would either be regularized in a
supplementary budget or rejected by the Minister of Finance. This would reestablish the
integrity of the budget framework.
26.
Financing constraints in the WAEMU market have become tighter. Banks’
excess reserves have fallen sharply in the wake of borrowing by several WAEMU
governments. Tapping the regional market will therefore require more
MEFP ¶13
planning to make security issues more predictable and interesting to investors
regarding timing and maturity. The program includes a commitment to develop, jointly with
the BCEAO by end-June 2008, a rolling two-year plan for securities issues in the regional
1

The authorities report budgetary costs of the Islamic Conference at 0.4 percent of GDP, some of which was
regularized in a supplementary budget after the event.

24
market, which would be updated each time the market is accessed (structural benchmark).
This should help prevent a repeat of past cash-flow problems, lower the risk of payment
delays to the private sector, and support the development of the WAEMU market.
Importantly, it could also help make monetary operations of the BCEAO more effective, by
helping mopping up excess liquidity in a systematic way and providing the central bank with
a reliable source of securities for its open market operations.
27.
At the request of the authorities, the program includes a nonzero ceiling on
nonconcessional borrowing (CFAF 80 billion). This is to provide for part of the
government’s share in a toll road that is being developed as a PPP to link
MEFP ¶12
Dakar with Diamniadio where the new airport and DISEZ are located—a
prerequisite for making both projects viable. Donors, including the Bank, are
providing the rest of the government’s share in the project. Donor feasibility studies suggest
that its expected return exceeds the anticipated costs of the nonconcessional borrowing.
Alternative donor financing for this project is not in sight, and raising funds of this
magnitude in the WAEMU market would exceed that market’s capacity. Nonetheless, should
receipts from privatization or the sale of other government assets become available, the
nonzero ceiling would be adjusted downward correspondingly. 2
C. Structural Reform Agenda
28.
Structural conditionality is proposed to be streamlined. Six structural assessment
criteria or benchmarks are proposed for the PSI’s second review. This compares to nine
structural conditions in the program’s initial phase. 3
29.
Structural conditionality centers on the main pillars of the PSI (MEFP Table 2). 4
The MEFP contains additional commitments not subject to conditionality. This holds
particularly true for reforms in public financial management and efforts to strengthen
financial sector supervision and remove impediments to financial intermediation. The
following structural conditions have been agreed with the authorities:

2

The authorities are contemplating the sale of their minority share in SONATEL, the profitable
telecommunications company. At the time of the mission, they confirmed that they had not yet made a decision.
Given the potentially substantial privatization receipts, staff reiterated that the use of the receipts would need to
be thoroughly discussed and fully reflected in the macroeconomic framework. Staff also urged the authorities to
use a multi-bid tender for the consultancy and divestiture phase, in line with the new procurement framework
and the PSI program’s emphasis on fiscal transparency and governance.

3

The reduction in structural conditionality takes into account the Board discussion of the IEO report on
structural conditionality and the conclusions of the Ex-Post Assessment for Senegal that the excessive
conditionality of past programs should be avoided.
4

Private sector development is one of the pillars of the PSI, but specific conditionality in this area that would
pass the macro criticality threshold proved difficult to derive.

25
Objective: Support the fiscal policy stance, shore up macroeconomic stability, and
strengthen fiscal governance and transparency
•

Ringfencing the revenue impact of DISEZ. The authorities will issue an
implementation decree to the DISEZ law by mid-November 2008 to (i) prevent firms
from specific sectors, in particular regulated telecommunications
MEFP ¶17
companies and petroleum companies selling domestically, from
moving to the zone; and (ii) limit fraud possibilities through a list of sanctions and the
possible exclusion of certain companies from the zone (structural assessment
criterion). 5 These measures were agreed upon based on a study undertaken by the
authorities of the possible revenue implications of DISEZ (Box 7).
Box 7. The Dakar Integrated Special Economic Zone (DISEZ)
In early 2008, the authorities signed an agreement with JAFZA of Dubai to build and
operate a special economic zone outside Dakar. The investor will develop the infrastructure,
investing US$800 million, on government-owned land and rent sites to companies that will
benefit from a favorable tax regime. The agreement does not contain any government financial
guarantees or direct public spending commitments in the zone. As the site is currently barren
and undeveloped, it may be two years before the first firms could move into the zone.
The authorities consider the zone an incubator to modernize the economy and accelerate
the pace of reform, with significant positive externalities throughout the country. As such,
they expect the zone to create thousands of direct and indirect jobs and play an important role
in reducing poverty.
Although the authorities expect the zone to be at least revenue neutral, they intend to
implement safeguards to this effect. In this context, they carried out a study to assess the
zone’s potential revenue implications (which met an end-2007 benchmark). The study
concluded that the direct tax implications of enterprises moving to the zone would be limited if
companies from certain sectors—especially telecommunications—were barred from moving
in. The authorities also examined the practices of other economic zones and concluded that
entry into, and exit from, the zone will have to be controlled to prevent flagrant fraud and tax
evasion. To this end, they intend to enclose the zone with a high fence or wall, allow only very
few entry and exit points, administer it rigorously, and introduce transfer pricing rules to
combat possibilities for fraud and tax evasion.

•

Auditing all payment delays. See paragraph 25 above.

In addition, the fiscal and administrative agent role of APIX in relation to the relevant fiscal authorities
(customs, revenue authority), as well as specific actions to combat fraud and tax evasion, are to be defined by
March 2009 (structural benchmark).

26
•

Strengthening tax administration. By end-October 2008, the authorities will transfer
responsibility for direct tax collections for large enterprises from the
Treasury to the Revenue Authority (structural benchmark). This has
MEFP ¶23
been a long-standing Fund technical assistance and fiscal ROSC
advice. By placing the assessment and recovery of taxes in the same unit, possibilities
for tax evasion will be sharply curtailed. This should help safeguard tax collections
and lessen the fiscal risks from DISEZ.

•

Implementing energy sector reform. As stated above, energy sector reform is macro
critical to improve the supply of energy and contain the sector’s drag on the budget.
The main budgetary impact has emanated from the authorities’
MEFP ¶22
hesitation to raise electricity prices in line with the cost structure,
which in turn was partially motivated by deficiencies in the existing
formula. Against this background, the authorities will introduce, by August 1, 2008, a
new electricity tariff structure that will have rising marginal costs to discourage high
consumption and favor low-income households (structural assessment criterion).

Objective: Support implementation of the authorities’ new growth model while
safeguarding macroeconomic stability
•

Strengthening investment planning and evaluation: As elaborated in Box 3, the
authorities have become increasingly aware of the need for better investment
planning and evaluation. Given limited financing options and planning capacity,
better selection and prioritization of investment projects, based on well-defined
standards, would allow a focus on high-return projects and raise the productivity of
government spending. At the same time, the authorities recognize that
MEFP ¶16
the investment program needs to be consistent with their strategic
objectives and the macroeconomic framework. To this end, they will develop, by
mid-November 2008, directives on improving the planning and evaluation of public
investment (structural assessment criterion).
Objective: Eliminate government cash-flow problems, strengthen debt management,
and support financial sector development and the BCEAO’s monetary operations

•

Rationalizing the government’s recourse to the regional financial market. See
paragraph 26 above.

27
D. Program Monitoring
30.

Three changes are being proposed in program monitoring:

•

Given the need to expeditiously eliminate expenditure commitments carried over
from 2007, it is proposed that the floor on the basic fiscal balance be raised to
CFAF 48 billion for end-June 2008.

•

The ceiling on nonconcessional borrowing is proposed to be defined on a cumulative
basis and raised from zero to CFAF 80 billion in the fourth quarter of 2008, to help
finance the Dakar-Diamniadio toll road. While the expenditure will be made in both
2008 and 2009, the program allows the total amount to be borrowed at once to help
the authorities obtain the best financing terms.

•

It is proposed that the ceiling on the budgetary float be redefined to monitor a greater
range of payment delays. Instead of just capturing expenditures for which a payment
order has been issued but not yet paid, the new definition would start at the point
where the government receives and validates a bill. Since the new definition is
broader, and it will take some time to clear all existing payment delays, the budgetary
float ceiling is raised from CFAF 30 billion to CFAF 50 billion at mid-year, before
being gradually lowered to CFAF 30 billion by year-end. However, the zero ceiling
on arrears is maintained as an additional safeguard.
VI. STAFF APPRAISAL

31.
Senegal’s macroeconomic performance and outlook have improved relative to
last year. Economic growth has recovered and prospects are promising, as long as the FDIdriven investment materializes, the restructuring of ICS moves forward, and prudent
macroeconomic policies are maintained. This should also help keep the external outlook
stable despite a more difficult external environment. However, food and energy price
increases could keep inflation above its historic trend in the short run.
32.
Structural reforms will be key to raising competitiveness and improving export
performance. The authorities’ new growth strategy needs to be implemented vigorously to
provide the necessary impetus in this regard. The real exchange rate appears to be broadly in
line with economic fundamentals, but its development needs to be carefully monitored.
33.
Regarding fiscal policy, the failure to rein in nonpriority spending in 2007 is
regrettable. Although the basic fiscal balance target was met at end-2007, delaying the
issuance of payment orders for spending equivalent to 2 percent of GDP was a worrisome
development and onerous for the private sector. The staff strongly urges the authorities to
forcefully implement the Prime Minister’s administrative order to contain spending
commitments in 2008 to allow the full clearance of unpaid bills and maintain fiscal prudence.

28
Moreover, if the audit of past expenditure confirms spending without budgetary
authorization, the government should take appropriate action expeditiously.
34.
The need to limit risks to social peace can justify food and energy subsidies on a
temporary basis if they are well-targeted. Nonetheless, the high costs of such measures
crowd out other, possibly higher priority, spending. Raising or even maintaining such
subsidies over the medium term is thus not sustainable. It is therefore imperative to identify
alternative policy measures, in consultation with development partners and other countries in
the region. The guiding principles should be budget affordability, better targeting to help
those in need, and limiting economic distortions.
35.
The strong implementation of the program’s structural component is
commendable. In particular, several key measures were taken to improve fiscal governance
and transparency. This strong performance should be built on to strengthen public financial
management even further. In addition, the authorities are encouraged to enhance the legal
and regulatory environment for the financial sector, closely supervise it, and work toward the
removal of identified obstacles to higher financial intermediation.
36.
Notwithstanding the fiscal slippages and the somewhat higher risks to the
program stemming from the more challenging external environment, the staff
recommends completion of the first program review. On balance, the corrective actions
initiated by the authorities, together with the broadening of program targets, would allow past
fiscal slippages to be fully corrected in 2008 and provide the basis for resuming the path of
fiscal adjustment thereafter. On the basis of the prompt corrective actions taken, the staff also
supports the authorities’ request for a waiver for the nonobservance of the quantitative
assessment criterion on domestic arrears during the first three weeks of the program period.
Finally, the program’s structural measures, once implemented, will shore up fiscal policy
against a variety of risks, including those related to the planned special economic zone.
37.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place within 24
months, subject to the provisions of the decision on consultation cycles in program
countries.

Sources: Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO); and Fund staff estimates and projections.
1/ Includes receipts from sale by the government to a Sudanese operator of a telecom license for US$200 million in 2007.
2/ Reflects MDRI stock debt relief in 2006. Debt relief from the Fund is recorded as a capital transfer. Debt relief from the IDA and the AfDF on the amounts
falling due in 2006 is shown as exceptional financing, while debt relief on amounts due in 2007 and beyond is recorded as a capital transfer.
3/ Until 2005, HIPC Initiative flow debt relief granted by the IMF is recorded as a grant, and that granted by the World Bank,
the African Development Bank, Paris Club creditors,and Kuwait is recorded as exceptional financing.

Dakar, Senegal
May 30, 2008
Mr. Dominique Strauss-Kahn
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, N.W.
Washington, D.C., 20431
Dear Mr. Strauss-Kahn,
1.
The attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) reviews
implementation to date of the government of Senegal’s macroeconomic and structural
program under the country’s three-year Policy Support Instrument (PSI), approved by the
IMF Executive Board on November 2, 2007. Details of this program were set in the initial
MEFP of October 3, 2007. The attached MEFP builds on this initial Memorandum, with
particular emphasis on targets and policy prospects for 2008–09.
2.
All assessment criteria for the first review under the PSI were met, save for the
nonobservance of the continuous quantitative criterion on domestic arrears. Indeed, this
criterion could not be met on a continuous basis at the beginning of the program. However,
these arrears were quickly eliminated by end-November and the government has since then
avoided any accumulation of new arrears. In light of this prompt corrective measure, the
government requests a waiver of the missed criterion.
3.
The government believes that the policies and measures set forth in the attached
MEFP are adequate to achieve the objectives of a PSI program. Given its commitment to
these objectives, it will promptly take any additional measures necessary for their
achievement. The government will consult with the IMF—at its own initiative or whenever
the Managing Director of the IMF requests such a consultation—before the adoption of any
such measures or changes to the policies described in the attached Memorandum.
4.
The government will provide the Fund with such information as the Fund may
request in connection with the progress made in implementing the economic and financial
policies and achieving the objectives of the program.

40
5.
The government authorizes the IMF to publish this letter, the attached Memorandum,
and the related Staff Report.

Sincerely yours,

ATTACHMENT I
MEMORANDUM OF ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES
Dakar, May 30, 2008
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
The government remains committed to higher sustainable growth and making
fast progress toward the MDGs. To achieve these goals, it will continue to implement its
economic and financial program, which relies on prudent macroeconomic policies and
accelerated structural reforms and is supported by the IMF through a three-year Policy
Support Instrument (PSI). The government’s commitments, as spelled out in the
Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) dated October 3, 2007, will
continue to anchor our policies and reforms going forward. This new MEFP describes recent
economic developments and program performance, and presents the specific measures and
objectives for 2008–09.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND PROGRAM PERFORMANCE
2.
Macroeconomic developments in 2007 were broadly in line with program
projections. Following a marked slowdown in 2006, and although the agricultural sector
experienced a second year of output decline, GDP growth is estimated to have rebounded to
4¾ percent, driven by the services and construction sectors. Inflation increased to about
6 percent and the external current account deficit reached about 10½ percent of GDP, mainly
due to large international food and energy price increases.
3.
At end-2007, the government met all quantitative assessment criteria except the
one on domestic arrears. This criterion could not be met on a continuous basis at the
beginning of the program. However, these arrears were quickly eliminated by endNovember.
4.
The target on the basic fiscal balance was met, and the overall fiscal deficit was
lower than expected, at 3½ percent of GDP. This mainly reflects under-execution of HIPC
and MDRI expenditure (0.4 percent of GDP), a surplus of nonfinancial public entities (0.2
percent of GDP), and lower-than-expected onlending (0.1 percent of GDP); these lines are
excluded from the program criterion definition. However, the government slowed the
issuance of payment orders for some expenditure (equivalent to 1.8 percent of GDP) that had
already been committed, which made it difficult to honor its commitments to the private
sector. The payment delays had become necessary for two main reasons: (i) given the
implementation of subsidies and suspensions of certain taxes to contain the impact of food
and energy price increases, the government had to slow the issuance of payment orders for
other expenditure (mainly investment spending) and (ii) it has committed expenditure in an
amount that was higher than what was compatible with the program.

42
5.
The government has been striving to improve public procurement practices. In
spite of this, the indicative ceilings on the share of single-tender public contracts for the last
quarter of 2007 and the first quarter of 2008 were missed, because a large number of
contracts was approved during this period based on the old procurement code. However, the
implementation of the new procurement framework will make it possible to meet this
indicator as early as the second quarter 2008.
6.
The government succeeded in improving the allocation of spending toward
priority sectors in 2007. 1 The targeted ratio of 33 percent of total expenditure for social
spending was met, which represents an increase of 2 percentage points compared to 2006.
7.
The government made great strides in implementing its structural reform
program. All structural assessment criteria and all but one benchmark through end-March
2008 were met. At this date, the submission of the 2004 and 2005 Treasury accounts to the
audit court was only partially completed, since it only covered 9 and 5 accounts (postes
comptables), respectively, out of 12. The submission of the 2004 and 2005 accounts will be
fully completed by end-April and end-May, respectively. Most other measures not subject to
conditionality but specified in the MEFP have been implemented.
III. MACROECONOMIC POLICIES FOR 2008–09
8.
The macroeconomic outlook for 2008–09 is broadly favorable despite the more
difficult international perspective. Real GDP growth is projected to reach about 5½ percent
on average over the next two years, reflecting a gradual recovery of ICS’s operations,
buoyant construction activity, and continued strong growth in the telecommunications and
transport sectors. Inflation is projected to return to its historical level of 2 percent over the
medium term. Nonetheless, because upward pressures on the prices of food and energy are
expected to continue in the short run, the government projects the inflation rate at 4½ percent
in 2008. The external current account deficit should oscillate between 11 and 12 percent of
GDP, financed to an increasingly large extent by FDI inflows. External and domestic public
debt would increase moderately, reaching about 21 and 7 percent of GDP, respectively, by
2009. While the regional framework for monetary and exchange rate policies will continue to
help preserve low inflation, a prudent fiscal policy will remain the key instrument for
achieving macroeconomic stability in Senegal and contribute to the WAEMU’s external
stability.

1

Social expenditures in the context of the program are those of the PRSP. They include spending on health,
education, justice, social development, environment, rural hydraulics, and waste management.

43
A. Fiscal Policy
Fiscal stance
9.
The government reiterates its commitment to limit the overall fiscal deficit to
4 percent of GDP over the medium term. This deficit level will preserve public debt
sustainability. This in turn will be key to underpin investment and growth and also help
maintain domestic stability by containing demand pressures and avoiding crowding out the
private sector. Nonetheless, the deficit will temporarily rise to 4.9 percent of GDP in 2008,
after 3½ percent of GDP in 2007, in view of the regularization of expenditure committed in
2007. The deficit target will be consistent with a basic fiscal deficit of CFAF 95 billion in
2008 (quantitative assessment criterion). The government will resume its envisaged mediumterm fiscal adjustment path in 2009.
10.
The government is aware of the need to curtail nonpriority spending in 2008. To
this end, it published on May 19, 2008, an administrative order (circulaire) from the prime
minister that limits the authorizations of commitments (engagements) for current expenditure
in goods and services to CFAF 229 billion and commitments for domestically-financed
capital expenditure to CFAF 429 billion, while at the same time protecting priority
expenditures. The administrative order from the prime minister indicates that expenditure
related to preceding years will have to be paid in priority. A subsequent administrative order
by the Minister of Economy and Finance was issued on May 20, 2008 to provide the
breakdown of the authorizations of commitments by ministries consitent with the Prime
Minister’s administrative order (prior action). The government has provided the IMF staff
with the list of envisaged adjustments relative to the 2008 budget laws. The government will
block the authorizations of commitments in SIGFIP (the expenditure tracking system) in
order to apply the administrative orders.
11.
Spending in favor of priority sectors will continue to be increased. This should
make it possible to bring social expenditure to 40 percent of total expenditure, or 10.7
percent of GDP, by 2010. Allocations to social sectors will reach 9.5 percent of GDP in 2008
and 10 percent of GDP in 2009. Expenditure in favor of rural areas and infrastructure
spending will also be increased. This will be facilitated by the completion of the
replenishment of the HIPC and MDRI accounts, in the amount of CFAF 15 billion in 2008,
in line with the commitments from the preceding MEFP (paragraph 46), and by the integral
use of this amount and all resources freed by these initiatives. The government will use these
accounts exclusively for their intended purpose. Finally, in order to facilitate tracking of
HIPC and MDRI expenditure, all payment orders related to such expenditure will be assigned
the relevant identifying code by end-2008.
Debt Management
12.
To underpin debt sustainability, the government will continue to adhere to the
general principle of neither contracting nor guaranteeing external loans on

44
nonconcessional terms. Nonetheless, it will need to have recourse to such resources in the
amount of about CFAF 80 billion for one high priority project (quantitative assessment
criterion). This would allow us to quickly complement donor resources to cover the State’s
share in 2008 and 2009 for the costs of the Dakar-Diamniadio toll highway, which is being
developed under a public-private partnership. Several feasibility studies, including those by
the World Bank and the Agence Française de Développement, have shown that the return of
this project exceeds the cost of the nonconcessional borrowing for the government’s share.
The government will consult with IMF staff well in advance for any additional future
exceptions to this assessment criterion. The principles for such borrowing are stipulated in
paragraph 22 of the preceding MEFP.
13.
Consistent with earlier commitments, other aspects of debt management will
also be strengthened. First, the government will develop before end-June 2008 a rolling
two-year program of issuance of government securities, in collaboration with the BCEAO
(structural benchmark). The program will aim at lengthening the maturity profile of securities
and make market access more frequent and regular. It will be updated after each security is
issued and will be consistent with the macroeconomic framework under the PSI. Such a
program of issuance of government securities should help limit the government’s cash flow
problems and facilitate the development of regional financial markets. Second, starting in
December 2008, the semiannual debt sustainability analysis will include an analysis of risks
posed by contingent liabilities stemming from government guarantees, PPPs, and the
operations of public enterprises.
Elimination of payment delays
14.
Based on a preliminary stocktaking exercise completed in May 2008, we have
identified extrabudgetary spending and payment delays in the early stages of the
expenditure chain. Spending without budget appropriation, equivalent to about 0.2 percent
of GDP, may have taken place in 2007 and early 2008 and will be fully regularized in a new
supplementary budget, unless the Minister of Economy and Finance (MEF) considers that it
does not respect the rules governing public expenditure as stipulated by article 18 of the 2007
budget law. Payment delays in the early stages of the expenditure chain related to prior fiscal
years and amounting to 1.8 percent of GDP will be fully settled during 2008. These delays
have arisen because the government slowed the issuance of payment orders, while continuing
to commit to expenditures. The preliminary stocktaking exercise will be supplemented by
end-September 2008 with a thorough audit of the State’s payment delays by the financial
audit inspectorate of the MEF (Inspection Générale des Finances), which will, if need be, be
assisted by a specialized private audit firm (structural benchmark). In addition, the
government will take appropriate corrective actions to restore the integrity of the budgetary
framework and support private sector development and the soundness of the banking system.
For this purpose, it will:

45
a.

Not accumulate any domestic payment arrears under the WAEMU definition
(continuous quantitative assessment criterion).

b.

Limit the stock of the budgetary float, defined as expenditure for which a bill has
been received and recognized (dépenses liquidées) but remains unpaid (quantitative
assessment criterion).

c.

Limit the stock of expenditure committed (dépenses engagées) for which a bill has
not been recognized (dépenses non liquidées) .

d.

Improve the monitoring of budget execution and the expenditure chain by:
(i) installing the ASTER accounting software at the Treasury and connecting it to the
SIGFIP software of the Ministry of Economy and Finance by the end of the second
quarter 2009; and (ii) in the meantime, using the recent extension of SIGFIP to the
payment phase.

e.

Limit Treasury advances to 10 percent of total annual spending on nonwage current
expenditure and domestically-financed capital expenditure and to no more than CFAF
30 billion at any given point.
IV. STRUCTURAL REFORMS
A. Fiscal Structural Reforms

15.
Fiscal structural reforms will remain at the core of our structural reform
program. This should enable us to improve the productivity of public expenditures, enhance
fiscal transparency, and better assess, contain, monitor, and report budgetary risks.
Strengthening investment planning and evaluation
16.
The government will continue to honor earlier commitments to strengthen
public investment planning and evaluation and improve the framework for the
implementation of PPPs. This will allow it to enhance efficiency gains and better
implement its ambitious investment program that is to help lay the foundation for strong
future economic growth. During 2008–09, the following measures will be given priority:
a.

The government will issue, by November 15, 2008, a prime ministerial administrative
order that will stipulate guidelines to strengthen public investment planning and
evaluation. These guidelines will be developed in a participative way by
representatives of the State’s services involved in investment planning and
evaluation. The guidelines will aim to describe the procedures and institutional
responsibilities to ensure: (i) consistency of investment projects with strategic
objectives and between investment projects; (ii) consistency of investment programs
with the medium-term macroeconomic framework; and (iii) the establishment of
standards for project analysis according to the size of the projects, as well as the

46
respect of these standards in order to facilitate the selection of the best projects
(structural assessment criterion).
b.

As planned under the Accelerated Growth Strategy (AGS), and in line with the
recommendations of the Presidential Investment Council (CPI), the government will
prepare, by end-June 2008, a modification to the Law 2004-13 of March 1, 2004, on
Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) contracts. In particular, this modification will aim at
allowing, in case of dispute, international arbitration and the choice of the third
arbiter by a neutral institution rather than the Dakar regional court.

Large investment projects
17.
The government will continue to ensure transparency and efficiency in the
execution of its large investment projects. It considers these projects as key to increase the
growth potential of the Senegalese economy. Earlier commitments regarding the airport
project and the Dakar integrated special economic zone (DISEZ) will continue to be
observed. With respect to DISEZ, the government is determined to continue the preparations
for making the zone operational by 2010. At the same time, it is committed to creating a zone
that generates value added without weakening the government’s revenue base. The zone
should therefore help generate a rise in growth and employment while preserving
macroeconomic stability. To this end:
a.

The government will adopt an implementation decree on the DISEZ law by
November 15, 2008. The decree will stipulate that (i) regulated enterprises in the
telecommunications sector, i.e., telecommunications operators, will be excluded from
coverage of the DISEZ law; (ii) enterprises in the hydrocarbons sector will be
authorized in the zone only if they are exclusively dedicated to exporting; and (iii) as
envisaged under article 30 of the DISEZ law, a list of sanctions will be implemented
in case the regulations governing the zone are violated, especially with a view to
limiting fiscal fraud and having the possibility of excluding enterprises in case of
major breaches of these regulations (structural assessment criterion).

b.

With a view to ensuring the efficiency, equity, and viability of the tax system, and to
limit possibilities for fraud, APIX, the Revenue Authority (DGID) and the Customs
Authority (DDI) will agree, by end-March 2009, on memoranda of understanding
(protocoles d’accord) that will stipulate, among other things: (i) their respective
rights and responsibilities; (ii) the specific measures to fight against fraud and tax
evasion; and (iii) the rules for resolving conflict (structural benchmark).

c.

In order to safeguard the fiscal integrity of the zone, the government will secure it
with a wall or a fence and set up a very limited number of access roads. The
government will implement a GPS tracking system to track transport vehicles
entering and leaving the zone.

47
d.

The government will prepare directives on transfer pricing, based on OECD
guidelines.

Procurement
18.
A new procurement framework is now in place, and the government is
determined to apply it forcefully. Specifically:
a.

The government will redouble its efforts to respect the quarterly indicative target on
the share of government contracts awarded on a noncompetitive basis, set at
20 percent of all contracts, including those entered into by agencies.

b.

Starting at end-June 2008, the government will publish on the website of the central
directorate for public procurement (DCMP) the list of contracts awarded quarterly.

c.

No public procurement will be allowed unless it has been included in the procurement
plans submitted to the DCMP.

d.

Starting at end-June 2008, the procurement regulatory agency (ARMP) will conduct
audits and surveys of government contracts, as described in the earlier MEFP.

Monitoring risks inherent to public sector operations and fiscal transparency
19.
In order to strengthen the monitoring of fiscal risk and enhance fiscal
transparency, the government will:
a.

Reflect in an annex to the Budget Law, starting with the 2009 Budget Law, the fiscal
risks associated with public sector operations, the financial flows related to quasifiscal activities of public or private enterprises and public entities, as well as a
quantitative assessment of tax exemptions, in aggregate terms, for the last available
fiscal year.

b.

Forward the end-year Treasury accounts (Comptes de gestion) for 2006 to the audit
court by end-August 2008 and those for 2007 by end-March 2009.

c.

Forward the draft budget review law (lois de règlement) for 2004 to the audit court
before end-June 2008 and those for 2005–06 before end-December 2008.

d.

Submit to Parliament by end-October 2008 a law establishing the conditions under
which government agencies may be created and specifying the objectives, decisionmaking bodies, and mechanisms for controlling their operations and budget execution
procedures.

e.

Provide the audit court, in the context of the 2009 Budget Law, with the necessary
resources to obtain additional premises with sufficient space—through renting,
buying or building offices—and to hire 30 new judges and prosecuting attorneys for
each audit chamber.

48
Alleviating price increases
20.
Helping the population cope with the impact of rising food and energy prices is a
national priority. In doing so, the government intends to strike the appropriate balance
between safeguarding macroeconomic stability and providing immediate temporary relief to
those in need. To this end, the government will examine options for improving the targeting
of existing relief measures and containing their impact on the budget.
21.
With a more medium-term perspective, the government will focus on improving
the supply and lowering the costs of food and energy products. The agricultural sector is
also vital to the fight against poverty. The government attaches importance to expanding
domestic agricultural production, in particular of high-yield products, such as rice. To this
end, it will work with farmers to improve infrastructure, particularly irrigation and storage
systems; increase competition; and redirect agricultural subsidies to help enhance farm
productivity. In the same vein, energy sector reform is aimed at enhancing production and
generating cost reductions which the government intends to gradually pass on to consumers.
Energy sector reform
22.
Energy sector reform is crucial to improve the supply of energy to the economy
and contain fiscal risks. The government has finalized the main elements of its reform
program—supported by the World Bank and other donors—with the signature of the sectoral
policy letter. The government is guided by the principle of truth in pricing and the
implementation of energy savings and efficiency gains. To support the reform program, it
will:
a.

By August 1, 2008, adopt and make effective the new tariff structure for electricity,
which provides a progressive pricing structure—which would encourage energy
savings—and incorporates lower tariff adjustments for low-income consumers
(structural assessment criterion).

b.

Announce by August 1, 2008, an increase in electricity prices based on the
exceptional revision to the existing formula.

c.

Complete the recapitalization of SENELEC by 2009. In 2008, budgetary resources of
CFAF 37 billion will be provided to SENELEC for this purpose.

d.

The government remains committed to eliminating the butane subsidy by end-July
2009. In the meantime, butane prices will be adjusted to limit the annual subsidy to
CFAF 32 billion in 2008.

49
Tax administration
23.
The Revenue Authority (DGID) has followed a roadmap for further enhancing
the efficiency of tax administration. The priority measures for the coming months are to:
a.

Extend by end-December 2008 the tax management software (SIGTAS) to all taxes
for all Dakar collection centers.

b.

Make the interface between the information systems of the three tax revenuecollecting offices (DGID, DGD, and DGCPT) fully operational by February 2009.

c.

Adopt by October 31, 2008, all the legal texts and regulations necessary for the
effective transfer of direct State tax collection responsibilities from the Treasury to
the DGID starting January 1, 2009 (structural benchmark). This requires modification
of the Tax Code, the decree regulating public accounting, and the ministerial orders
relative to the organization of the DGID and the DGCPT. The integration of tax
assessment and collection in the same entity will facilitate the fight against fraud and
safeguard tax revenues. A schedule for this transfer along the following lines will be
published:
(i) Effective January 1, 2009 for the region of Dakar: Transfer of the
collection of the income tax (IR) by salary deduction, taxes on revenue by
professionals (bénéfices non commerciaux et autres sommes payées à des
tiers), profits taxes (IS), and income taxes owed by the taxpayers monitored
by the large taxpayer unit (CGE).
(ii) Effective January 1, 2010: Transfer of the IS and IR owed by other
taxpayers in the region of Dakar.
(iii) Effective January 1, 2011: Transfer of the IS and IR owed by taxpayers
located outside of Dakar.
B. Accelerated Growth Strategy and Development of the Private Sector

24.
The Accelerated Growth Strategy (AGS) will remain the anchor of the reform
agenda and of priority measures to enhance the growth potential of the Senegalese
economy. Implementation of this strategy is now on track with the adoption of framework
law 2008-03 of January 8, 2008, and its implementation decree 2008-56 of January 29, 2008
which sets out the organizing and functioning rules of the institutional framework for
implementing the AGS. The institutional set-up will be operational by end-May 2008. In
addition, the framework to assist the private sector will be restructured and strengthened in
order to better complement the AGS. The President’s Investment Council (CPI) is the
appropriate forum to advance the reform agenda for transversal measures, and progress is
assessed in weekly meetings of the relevant working groups.

50
C. Financial Sector Reforms
25.
The government is determined to safeguard the soundness of the financial
system and enhance its contribution to the economy. To this end, and consistent with
earlier commitments, the government will:
a.

Issue the implementation decrees for the new law on microfinance institutions by
end-June 2008 and strengthen the oversight unit within MEF.

b.

Submit to Parliament by end-December 2008 the new regional law against the
financing of terrorism.

c.

Implement all decisions and recommendations of the WAEMU regional banking
commission.

d.

Work closely with the BCEAO and the WAEMU regional banking commission to
limit the impact of the ICS restructuring plan on the banking system.

e.

Continue to discuss with the Association of Senegalese Banks a reduction in the tax
on banking operations (TOB) or its replacement with the VAT, in order to find a
solution that would facilitate access to credit while limiting the impact on public
finances.

f.

During the current year, train judges specialized in economic and financial matters
and improve procedures for real estate sales.
VI. PROGRAM MONITORING

26.
Quantitative assessment criteria for end-June 2008 and end-December 2008, and
indicative targets for end-September 2008 were set to monitor program implementation in
2008 (see Table 1 of the annexed Technical Memorandum of Understanding—TMU). The
government and IMF staff also agreed on the prior action, structural assessment criteria, and
benchmarks listed in Table 2 of the TMU. The second and third reviews are scheduled to
take place by end-December 2008 and by end-June 2009. The government understands that
completion of the second review of the program is contingent upon the observance of the
assessment criteria set for end-June 2008 and the structural assessment criteria for the period
through November 15, 2008.

51

ATTACHMENT II
TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
Dakar, May 30, 2008
1.
This technical memorandum of understanding (TMU) defines the quantitative and
structural assessment criteria, indicative targets, and structural benchmarks on the basis of
which the implementation of the Fund-supported program under the Policy Support
Instrument (PSI) will be monitored in 2008 and 2009. The TMU also establishes the terms
and timeframe for transmitting the data that will enable Fund staff to monitor program
implementation.
I. PROGRAM CONDITIONALITY
2.
The quantitative assessment criteria for June 30, 2008 and December 31, 2008 and
the quantitative indicators for September 30, 2008, are shown in Table 1. The prior action,
structural assessment criteria, and structural benchmarks established under the program are
presented in Table 2.
II. DEFINITIONS, ADJUSTERS, AND DATA REPORTING
A. The Government
3.
Unless otherwise specified below, the government is defined as the central
administration of the Republic of Senegal and does not include any local administration, the
central bank, or any government-owned entity with a separate legal personality (e.g., public
universities and hospitals).
B. Basic Fiscal Balance (Program Definition)
Definition
4.
The basic fiscal balance (program definition) is the difference between the
government’s budgetary revenue and total expenditure and net lending, excluding externallyfinanced capital expenditure (financed by donors), drawings on on-lent loans (except on-lent
loans to the energy sector financed through donor budget support), and expenditure funded
with HIPC- and MDRI-related resources. Budgetary revenue excludes privatization receipts
and sales of mobile telephone licenses or other government assets. Government expenditure
is defined on a payment order basis. The assessment criterion is set as a floor on the
cumulative basic fiscal balance since the beginning of the year.

52
Example
5.
The floor for the basic balance (program definition) as at December 31, 2008 is minus
CFAF 95 billion. It is calculated as the difference between budgetary revenue
(CFAF 1254 billion) and total expenditure and net lending (CFAF 1667 billion), excluding
externally financed capital expenditure (CFAF 231 billion), drawings on on-lent loans
(CFAF 0 billion), and expenditure funded with HIPC- and MDRI-related resources
(CFAF 87 billion).
Reporting requirements
6.
During the program period, the authorities will report monthly to Fund staff
provisional data on the basic fiscal balance (program definition) and its components with a
lag of no more than 45 days. Data on revenues and expenditure that are included in the
calculation of the basic fiscal balance, and on expenditure financed with HIPC- and MDRIrelated resources, will be drawn from preliminary treasury account balances. Final data will
be provided as soon as the final balances of the treasury accounts are available, but not later
than two months after the reporting of the provisional data.
C. Government Domestic Payments Arrears
Definition
7.
In line with the WAEMU definition, domestic payment arrears are government
expenditures cleared for payment (dépenses ordonnancées) but not paid during a period of
90 days after the date the payment order (ordonnancement) was cleared. The assessment
criterion on domestic payment arrears will be monitored on a continuous basis.
Reporting requirements
8.
The authorities will report to Fund staff any accumulation of domestic payments
arrears, as defined above, as soon as incurred. The government will also report to Fund staff
on a monthly basis and with a maximum delay of 60 days all committed expenditure
(dépenses engagées) and all certified expenditure that have not yet been cleared for payment
(dépenses liquidées non encore ordonnancées).
D. Budgetary Float
Definition
9.
The budgetary float (instances de paiement) is defined as the outstanding stock of
government expenditure for which bills have been received and validated (dépenses
liquidées) but not yet paid. The assessment criterion is set as a ceiling on the budgetary float,
monitored at the end of the quarter.

53
Reporting requirements
10.
The authorities will report to Fund staff the amount of budgetary float on the same
basis as described in paragraph 8 of this TMU.
E. Government External Payment Arrears
Definition
11.
External payment arrears are defined as the sum of payments owed and not paid on
the external debt contracted or guaranteed by the government. The definition of external debt
given in paragraph 13 is applicable here. The assessment criterion on external payment
arrears will be monitored on a continuous basis.
Reporting requirements
12.
The authorities will report to Fund staff any accumulation in external payment arrears
as soon as the due date is passed.
F. Contracting or Guaranteeing of
New Nonconcessional External Debt by the Government
Definition
13.
This assessment criterion applies not only to debt as defined in Point No. 9 of the
Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt (Executive Board Decision
No. 6230-(79/140), last amended by Executive Board Decision No. 12274-(00/85), adopted
August 24, 2000, but also to commitments contracted or guaranteed by the government for
which funds have not been received. It does not apply to government or governmentguaranteed CFAF borrowing from individuals or legal entities that are WAEMU residents. It
does not apply either to external loans contracted by the airport project company (AIDB) to
finance construction of the new Dakar Airport. The definition of new external debt under the
AC excludes debt rescheduling transactions of debt existing at the time of the approval of the
PSI. This criterion is measured on a cumulated basis since the approval of the first program
review. The ceiling was raised to CFAF 80 billion in the fourth quarter of 2008 exclusively
to finance the toll highway (Dakar-Diamniadio) project. The CFAF 80 billion ceiling will be
adjusted downward by the amount of any receipt from a privatization, a sale of a
telecommunication license, or any other State asset (such as Sonatel shares) during 2008.
14.
For purposes of this assessment criterion, government is understood to include the
government as defined in paragraph 3 above, as well as public institutions of an industrial
and commercial nature (EPIC), public administrative institutions (EPA), public institutions of
a scientific and technical nature, public institutions of a professional nature, public health
institutions, local administrations, public enterprises, and government-owned or controlled
independent companies (sociétés nationales) (i.e., public enterprises with financial autonomy
where the government holds at least 50 percent of the capital), and government agencies.

54
15.
Any external debt of which the present value, calculated with the reference interest
rates mentioned hereafter, is greater than 65 percent of the nominal value (grant element of
less than 35 percent) is considered nonconcessional, with the exception of IMF lending under
the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility, which is considered concessional even if it does
not meet the 35 percent grant element threshold. For debt with a maturity of more than
15 years, the ten-year reference market interest rate, published by the OECD, is used to
calculate the grant element. The six-month reference market rate is used for debt with shorter
maturities.
Reporting requirements
16.
The government will report any new external borrowing and its terms to Fund staff as
soon as external debt is contracted or guaranteed by the government.
G. Public Sector Contracts Signed by Single Tender
Definition
17.
Public sector contracts are administrative contracts, drawn up and entered into by
government entities subject to the procurement code, for the procurement of supplies,
delivery of services, or execution of work. Public sector contracts are considered single-bid
contracts when the contracting agent signs the contract with the chosen contractor without
competitive tender or award. The quarterly indicative target will apply to public sector
contracts examined by the Commission Nationale des Contrats de l’Administration (CNCA)
until December 31, 2007, and to those examined by the Direction Centrale des Marchés
(DCM) thereafter.
Reporting requirements
18.
The government will report quarterly to the Fund staff, with a lag of no more than one
month from the end of the observation period, the total value of contracts signed by all
ministries and agencies and the total value of all single-bid contracts signed by these
ministries and agencies.
III. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR PROGRAM MONITORING
19.

indicated:
(a)
Effective immediately: any decision, circular, edict, decree, ordinance, or law
having economic or financial implications for the current program;

accounts are available, but not later than two months after the reporting of provisional
data.
20.
During the program period, the authorities will report to Fund staff provisional data
on a monthly basis on current nonwage non-interest expenditures and domestically financed
capital expenditures executed through advance payments and treasury advances, with a lag of
no more than 45 days. The data will be drawn from preliminary consolidated treasury
account balances. Final data will be provided as soon as the final balances of the treasury
accounts are available, but no more than two months after the reporting of provisional data.
21.

The government will report to Fund staff:
•
•
•
•
•

The monthly balance sheet of the Central Bank, with a maximum lag of
two months;

AND
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
SENEGAL
Joint IMF/IDA Debt Sustainability Analysis
Prepared by the Staffs of the International Monetary Fund and the
International Development Association
Approved by Sharmini Coorey and Adnan Mazarei (IMF)
and Sudhir Shetty and Carlos Braga (World Bank)
May 30, 2008
The 2008 debt sustainability analysis (DSA) indicates that Senegal is at a low risk of debt
distress. 1 External debt ratios have improved substantially over the past few years thanks to
HIPC and MDRI debt relief while domestic debt ratios have traditionally been low, and debt
dynamics under the baseline scenario are projected to remain favorable.
I. BACKGROUND
1.
Senegal’s external debt sustainability indicators improved substantially after the
enhanced HIPC Initiative and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI). Senegal
reached its HIPC completion point in April 2004, when it received debt relief of about
US$850 million in nominal terms. 2 In 2005, Senegal qualified for further debt relief under
the MDRI when the IMF, the International Development Association (IDA) and the African
Development Fund (AfDF) cancelled their claims on Senegal amounting to about
US$1.4 billion in nominal terms. 3 As a result of these two initiatives, the NPV of external
public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) debt outstanding has been substantially reduced from
33.1 percent of GDP at end-2005 to an estimated 18.3 percent of GDP at end-2007.
1

The DSA has been prepared jointly by World Bank and IMF staffs. The fiscal year for Senegal is January 1 to
December 31.

2

See Senegal: Enhanced Initiative for HIPC-Completion Point Document (Country Report 04/130 or
IDA/R2004-0065).

3

MDRI debt relief from the IMF became effective January 5, 2006, providing stock relief on debt disbursed
before end-2004 and still outstanding at end-2005. IDA and the AfDF started providing debt relief in July 2006.
The eligible debt covers IDA credits disbursed before end-2003 and AfDF credits disbursed before end-2004
that were still outstanding at the time of qualification.

2
2.
Nominal external debt amounted to US$4.5 billion (18.1 percent of GDP) at end2007, of which the World Bank and AfDB held 44 percent and Paris Club creditors held
6 percent. Since the last DSA (completed in January 2007), the Islamic Development Bank
and China have granted debt relief to Senegal and only ECOWAS and Sweden have yet to
provide HIPC assistance.
3.
Senegal’s public domestic debt remains low. 4 The NPV of public domestic debt is
estimated at 5.6 percent of GDP at end-2007, or one-fourth of total debt. The majority of this
debt is non-concessional, denominated in local currency, and held by WAEMU banks. The
recent reforms of the regional financial market and ample bank liquidity have allowed
Senegal (and other WAEMU member countries) to increasingly place debt instruments,
including of longer maturity. In 2007, Senegal issued CFAF 113 billion (2 percent of GDP)
in two tranches, at 5.5 percent interest, over five and ten years.
4.
Private sector exposure also appears limited once the sector’s sizable assets are
considered. The International Investment Position compiled by the BCEAO for end-2006
indicates that the stock of private external debt is 22 percent of GDP, three quarters of which
consist of trade credits. The remainder is primarily loans taken abroad and currency and
deposits owed by Senegalese banks to nonresidents. Private sector external assets amounting
to 13 percent of GDP may, depending on their disposition to service debt, also help limit
private sector exposure. Nonetheless, given its importance in overall external debt
sustainability, the future evolution of the private sector debt should be closely monitored.
II. UNDERLYING DSA ASSUMPTIONS
5.
The macroeconomic framework underlying the DSA is based on the
implementation of sound macroeconomic and structural policies, and external financing
mainly through grants, highly concessional loans, and significant FDI. Box 1
summarizes the key macroeconomic assumptions. Growth projections, broadly in line with
the baseline scenario of the PRSP II, average 5½ percent over 2008–28. This reflects the
authorities’ intention to raise the growth potential of the economy by increasing capital and
labor utilization and spur productivity growth. In addition to pursuing sound macroeconomic
policies, this would be achieved through reform efforts to improve the business environment,
diversify exports, develop infrastructure, make the provision of energy more reliable, and
reform the labor market. Grants and loans from donors are expected to remain significant.
FDI related to a number of well-defined projects is expected to pick up considerably and
should help sustain long-term growth. While FDI inflows will lead to higher imports and a
temporary increase in the current account deficit in the short run, these should subside over
the medium to long run as the FDI–related export production grows. With a primary fiscal
4

debt.

3
deficit declining from around 3 percent of GDP to 2 percent of GDP, external borrowing on
concessional terms will remain around 2 percent of GDP, with an average grant element of
39 percent. Any additional financing needs will be covered domestically, primarily through
bond issues in the regional financial markets.
6.
The underlying DSA assumptions differ from the previous DSA. Differences arise
as medium-term assumptions have been modified to reflect new information on commodity
prices, as well as potential and realized increased FDI commitments and a concomitant
projected improved performance of exports. Export performance is initially worse than in the
previous DSA, reflecting persistent difficulties in the groundnut and fishing sectors and a
slower recovery of the phosphate processor ICS. After 2013, FDI-related export production
propels export growth to higher levels than previously assumed. Imports are assumed to be
higher than in the past. Initially, this reflects higher oil prices and construction and services
created by FDI. In later years, reforms lead to faster growth in secondary and tertiary sectors
than in the past, resulting in increased imports. Consequently, the medium-run current
account deficit is assumed to be higher than in past projections, while the long-run current
account deficit fares much better than previously, as export growth begins to outpace import
growth. Finally, reflecting the government’s renewed commitment to macroeconomic
stability under the PSI, the long-run primary fiscal deficit is assumed to improve moderately
relative to previous projections.

4
Box 1. Macroeconomic Assumptions Underlying the DSA
The macroeconomic assumptions over the period 2008–28 are as follows:
Real GDP growth will average 5½ percent.
Inflation, as measured by the GDP deflator, is expected to return, over the medium
term, to its historical level of just above two percent.
The noninterest current account deficit (including grants) initially widens to about
11 percent of GDP in 2008–13. Export growth is projected to average 12½ percent
during the period—helped by a gradual recovery in traditional exports, especially of
phosphate products—but lags the rapid growth of imports related to the large FDI
projects and increased oil prices. Over 2014–28, once FDI-related exports (rising by
10.8 percent) begin to outpace import growth (rising by 9 percent), the current account
deficit could decline to about 7 percent of GDP by 2028. Net FDI is expected to hover
at around 6 percent of GDP over the medium to long term.
The primary fiscal deficit will gradually decline from just above 3 percent of GDP in
2007 to just under 2 percent of GDP in 2028, reflecting increased revenues and
improved public expenditure management—a reform focus under the PSI.
Net aid flows (grants and concessional loans) gradually decline from 7 percent of GDP
in 2008 to 3½ percent of GDP in 2028. Averaging 50 percent of total aid flows,
concessional loans are assumed to be on standard terms. For example, new IDA
borrowing (averaging almost 60 percent of new borrowing) is assumed to have a
0.75 percent interest rate, 10-year grace period, and 40-year maturity.
Public sector domestic borrowing will remain under 40 percent of overall public
sector borrowing (based on NPV of debt calculations). Commercial bank holdings of
Senegalese treasury bills and bonds remain the primary source of domestic public
credit, with an assumed 5½ percent interest rate and maturities ranging from one to ten
years.
Nonconcessional borrowing is assumed to remain the exception. The DSA
incorporates the borrowing related to the Dakar-Diamniado toll road, at
CFAF 40 billion (0.7 percent of GDP) each in 2008 and 2009. According to staff’s
analysis, the project’s expected return exceeds the anticipated costs associated with the
non-concessional funds. Alternative donor financing for this project is not in sight, and
raising funds of this magnitude in the WAEMU market would exceed that market’s
capacity. The incorporation of this non-concessional borrowing is in line with the
government’s commitment to consult with IMF staff (as specified in the PSI) and with
Bank staff well in advance for any exceptions that may possibly be needed, for projects
for which concessional financing cannot be obtained and a public private partnership
(PPP) cannot be negotiated.

5
III. EXTERNAL DSA
7.
Under the baseline scenario, all PPG external debt indicators remain relatively
stable over time and well below the policy-dependent debt burden thresholds. 5 A
marginal rise in some debt indicators is noticeable initially, reflecting growth in the NPV of
multilateral debt, before they assume a slight downward trend over time. The decline is most
pronounced in the NPV of the debt-to-exports ratio, as export growth outpaces debt growth.
The debt service ratios remain relatively stable and far below thresholds, with both the debtservice-to exports and debt-service-to-revenue ratio hovering around 5 percent (Figure 1,
Table 1).
8.
Debt indicators in the baseline initially are higher than under the historical
scenario, and later fall below the historical scenario. Initially, higher debt-creating flows
resulting from a higher medium-term current account deficit in the baseline, push the
projected debt path above the historical path. 6 The medium-term current account deficit in
the baseline is more than double that assumed in the historical scenario, which is based on
the average current account deficit over the past ten years (Figure 1, Table 2). In the long run,
the baseline assumes higher FDI flows than in the historical scenario. Lacking substantial
FDI to offset the current account deficit, the historical scenario accumulates debt-creating
flows.
9.
The standard stress tests do not reveal any serious vulnerabilities, as all ratios
are below the thresholds. The most extreme stress test for Senegal’s NPV of debt relative to
GDP and revenue is a temporary reduction in nondebt creating flows such as transfers and
FDI in 2009–10 (relative to the historical average). Debt and debt service both rise sharply
after the shock but remain below the thresholds during the projection period. A combination
of reduced nondebt creating flows and lower GDP and export growth is the most extreme
stress test for the NPV of debt-to-exports. In this case, the NPV of debt-to-exports rises
considerably, but it remains below the threshold (Figure 1, Table 2).
10.
An alternative stress test was calculated by applying a sudden decline in FDI; as
with the other stress tests, debt levels remained below thresholds. Although the sizeable
medium-term FDI growth is based on well-defined projects and FDI flows are generally
5

The quality of policies and institutions is measured by the World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional
Assessment (CPIA). An average of the most recent three-years’ ratings is applied in the analysis. The indicative
external debt burden thresholds for Senegal are: (i) an NPV of external PPG debt-to-GDP ratio of 40 percent;
(ii) an NPV of external PPG debt-to-exports ratio of 150 percent; (iii) an NPV of external PPG debt-to-revenue
ratio of 250 percent; (iv) an external PPG debt service-to-exports ratio of 20 percent; and (v) an external
medium- and long-term PPG debt service-to-revenue ratio of 30 percent.

6

Much of the projected current account deficit is financed through FDI inflows. However, non-FDI factors such
as weak export growth and higher oil prices create a balance of payments gap, which is assumed to be financed
by both public and private sector borrowing.

6
more stable than portfolio flows, there is always the possibility that FDI flows decline
drastically. This may occur as a result of a number of exogenous factors, such as the political
environment in either Senegal or the FDI-originating country. Even in the extreme scenario
that FDI comes to a complete halt in the two years where it is currently projected to be
largest (i.e., 2009–10), Senegal’s debt ratios would remain within the indicative thresholds
(Table 2).
IV. PUBLIC DSA
11.
The baseline scenario, consistent with the external DSA, entails a gradual rise in
debt indicators. The NPV of debt-to-GDP (debt-to-revenue) reaches a plateau at 30 percent
(135 percent). The relatively smooth path reflects a gradually declining fiscal deficit. The
non-concessional domestically issued debt and the assumed temporary reliance on nonconcessional external borrowing in 2008 and 2009 do not significantly impact public debt
sustainability. The debt service-to-revenue ratio is also relatively low, ranging between 6 and
9 percent (Figure 2, Table 3).
12.
Notwithstanding the manageable outlook in the baseline scenario, public debt
sustainability hinges on containing the fiscal deficit. If the fiscal deficit remains at the
2008 level of 5 percent of GDP (equivalent to a primary deficit of 4.2 percent of GDP) over
the entire projection period, the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio will increase by approximately
2 percent per year, from almost 25 percent in 2008 to 60 percent in 2028. The financing
needs created by the accumulated deficits would risk crowding out the private sector. The
NPV of debt-to-revenue and debt service indicators paint a similar picture, reinforcing the
need for the prudent fiscal policy that is currently envisioned in the baseline (Figure 2,
Table 4).
13.
The public debt position remains vulnerable to unexpected shocks. The second
most extreme stress test—a reduction in 2009 and 2010 real GDP growth by 2 percentage
points per annum (one standard deviation below past ten years average real GDP growth)—
would raise the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio to close to 60 percent by 2028. The NPV of debtto-revenue and debt service indicators would follow a similar upward trajectory. Given that
Senegal’s economy is prey to large fluctuations in real GDP growth, a cautious approach to
fiscal policy would thus be advisable. 7
V. CONCLUSION
14.
In sum, based on the staff’s analysis, Senegal’s external debt burden is subject to
a low risk of debt distress. In addition, the public DSA suggests that Senegal’s overall risk
of debt distress remains low even after considering domestic debt in the analysis. The
7

Senegal’s real GDP growth dropped by almost 3 percentage points in 2006 (from 5.3 percent in 2005 to
2.3 percent in 2006), mainly due to difficulties faced by ICS.

7
baseline projections and the associated standard stress tests show low risk related to external
debt, as all of the indicators remain well below the indicative debt burden thresholds.
However, public debt sustainability is vulnerable to increased fiscal deficits (exceeding
4 percent) and negative shocks to real GDP growth. Consequently, Senegal would benefit
from continued fiscal discipline, prudent non-concessional borrowing, and sensible debt
management.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price
and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that NPV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the NPV of new debt).

Source: Staff projections and simulations.
1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock
(implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Assumes no FDI flows in 2009-10.
7/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Safeguards Assessments:

The Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) is the common central bank of the
countries of the West African Economic and Monetary Union, which includes Senegal. The
most recent safeguards assessment of the BCEAO was completed on November 4, 2005. The
assessment indicated progress has been made in strengthening the bank's safeguards
framework since the 2002 assessment and identified some areas where further steps would
help solidify it.
The BCEAO now publishes a full set of audited financial statements and improvements have
been made to move financial reporting closer to International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS). Furthermore, an internal audit charter has been put in place, mechanisms for
improving risk management have been established, and follow-up on internal and external
audit recommendations has been strengthened.
The results of continuous safeguards monitoring indicate that while certain vulnerabilities
remain in internal control systems and legal structure, there has been some progress in other
areas, including through: (i) improving the external audit process by adopting a multi-year
audit program; (ii) establishing an audit committee; (iii) expanding disclosures on financial
positions of WAEMU countries with the Fund in the notes to the annual financial statements;
and (iv) further strengthening of the effectiveness of the internal audit function.
X.

Exchange System:

Senegal is a member of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU). The
exchange system, common to all members of the union, is free of restrictions on the making
of payments and transfers for current international transactions. The union's common
currency, the CFA franc, had been pegged to the French franc at the rate of CFAF 1 = F 0.02.
Effective January 12, 1994, the CFA franc was devalued and the new parity set at CFAF 1 =
F 0.01. Effective December 31, 1998, the parity was switched to the euro at a rate of
CFAF 655.96 = €1.
The authorities confirmed that Senegal had not imposed measures that could give rise to
exchange restrictions subject to Fund jurisdiction. They will inform the Fund if any such
measure is introduced.
Aspects of the exchange system are also discussed in the recent report on economic
developments and regional policy issues of the WAEMU.

bilateral contributions and the Fund's own resources, as well as the resources already disbursed to the member
under the HIPC Initiative (see Section VII above).

XI.

Article IV Consultations:

With the approval of Senegal’s PSI, the country is on a 24-month Article IV consultation
cycle following the completion of this year’s Article IV consultation. The 2006 Article IV
consultation was completed by the Executive Board on January 29, 2007 (IMF Country
Report No. 7/335). In concluding the Article IV consultation, Executive Directors stressed
that renewed efforts at macroeconomic stabilization and deepening of structural reforms
would be critical to improve the economy’s resistance to shocks, address problems in
budgetary discipline and fiscal transparency, and move toward the Millennium Development
Goals. Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to lower fiscal deficits over the medium
term in order to contain the external current account deficit and prevent debt distress and
arrears, and they urged prompt elimination of domestic payment arrears. They called for
early efforts to improve policy credibility and fiscal governance and transparency, stressing
that such improvements would be crucial for ensuring continued international support to
Senegal. Regarding the role of the private sector, Directors urged speedy implementation of
the authorities’ action plan for improving the business environment and reducing the cost of
doing business, which would be crucial for enhancing growth prospects. Directors also
observed that the financial sector could make a greater contribution to the economy through
improved access to credit and enhanced soundness.
XII.

Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) and Report on the Observance
of Standards and Codes (ROSC) Participation:

A joint team of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund conducted a mission
under the FSAP program in November 2000 and January 2001. The Financial System
Stability Assessment (FSSA) was issued in August 2001 (IMF Country Report No. 01/189).
An FSAP update was undertaken in June 2004, focusing on development issues (in particular
nationwide supply of basic financial services and access of SMEs to credit), in line with the
priorities defined in the PRSP (IMF Country Report No. 05/126). A regional FSAP for the
WAEMU was undertaken in the second half of 2007.
A ROSC on the data module, based on a September 2001 mission, was published on
December 2, 2002. An FAD mission conducted a ROSC on the fiscal transparency module in
January 2005.

Anti Money Laundering / Combating the Financing of Terrorism

The onsite visit for Senegal's AML/CFT evaluation took place in July/August 2007 in the
context of ECOWAS Inter-Governmental Action Group Against Money Laundering
(GIABA). The report was adopted in early May 2008 by the GIABA Plenary held in Accra,
Ghana. The report highlights several areas of weaknesses in the AML/CFT system,
confirmed by the score of 12 Non-Compliant and 17 Partially Compliant ratings out of the
40+9 FAF AML/CFT recommendations. Table 2 annexed to the Report contains
recommendations of the areas which the authorities should address in order to strengthen the
AML/CFT system. Following the AML/CFT assessment to be carried out in July/August
2008, the authorities should address the shortcomings identified in the report in order to
strengthen the Senegal AML/CFT framework.

Senegal: Statistical Issues
1.
Overall, the macroeconomic database is comprehensive and adequate for surveillance
and program monitoring. However, there are weaknesses in data on national accounts,
production, international trade, and social indicators. The authorities are strongly committed
to improving the quality and availability of economic, financial and social indicators,
partially relying on technical assistance from the Fund and other international organizations.
A Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes—Data Module, a Detailed Assessment
Using the Data Quality Assessment Framework (DQAF), and a Response by the Authorities
were published on the IMF website on December 2, 2002.
2.
The country has begun the process of regional harmonization of statistical
methodologies within the framework of the West African Economic and Monetary Union
(WAEMU). It participates in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS), and its
metadata were posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board on
September 10, 2001. The metadata are due for updating, including on priority areas for data
improvement. In May 2006, a STA mission evaluated dissemination practices against Special
Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) requirements for coverage, periodicity and timeliness
and helped the authorities develop an action plan to fill identified gaps.
Real sector statistics
3.
The compilation of the national accounts generally follows the System of National
Accounts, 1993. Despite staff’s professionalism, the lack of adequate financial resources has
constrained efforts to collect and process data. Data sources are deficient in some areas,
particularly the informal sector. Owing to financial constraints, surveys of business and
households are not conducted regularly and annual input-output tables and institutional sector
accounts are not compiled. However, efforts are being made to improve data collection
procedures, strengthen the coordination among statistical agencies, and reduce delays in data
dissemination.
4.
A regional advisor in real sector statistics covering the West AFRITAC countries,
including Senegal, was posted for one year beginning December 2005, with a first
assessment visit in March 2006 covering real sector statistics. Progress reported by the
advisor includes: i) completion of national accounts for 1980–2004 with 1999 as the base
year; ii) dissemination of the 1980–2003 series in hard copy and on the internet;
iii) production of accounts by institutional sector; and iv) production of national accounts
according to schedule. The authorities plan to start production of quarterly national accounts
in view of the country’s intention to subscribe to the SDDS. The West AFRITAC mission of
March-April 2007 assisted with training to support compilation of the quarterly accounts.
According to the work program, the first series of quarterly national accounts should be
produced by the end of 2008.
Public finance statistics
5.
Government finance statistics are compiled by the Ministry of Economy and Finance
from customs, tax, and treasury directorate sources. Data last reported to STA for electronic
redissemination and publication in the 2007 Government Finance Statistics Yearbook were

11
for fiscal year 2001. Higher frequency data are not updated for redissemination in IFS, but
the ministry compiles and disseminates quarterly government financial operations tables
(TOFE) in their own publications. However, the authorities do not have a good handle on
domestic arrears data and other payment delays because of weaknesses in the treasury
computerization system.
6.
An AFR team worked with the authorities in February 2004 to improve fiscal
reporting in the context of the last PRGF-supported program. The team focused on (i) public
accounts that are outside of the direct purview of the treasury; (ii) the treatment of
correspondents’ accounts in the TOFE; and (iii) ensuring consistency between treasury and
banking system information concerning government transactions. The proposed changes are
now being implemented. They will improve the presentation of government financial
operations and are the first step toward bringing the TOFE more in line with the extended
WAEMU TOFE. Other steps will include implementing the WAEMU fiscal directives that
are being revised.
7.
A regional advisor in government finance statistics conducted several technical
assistance missions aimed at improving the consistency of fiscal reporting and migrating to
the methodologies of the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001. The regional advisor
also supported efforts to resume reporting of annual and higher frequency data for
publication in International Financial Statistics (IFS) and electronic dissemination of the
GFS Yearbook.
Monetary and financial statistics
8.
Preliminary monetary data are compiled by the national agency of the Central Bank
of West African States (BCEAO) and officially released (including to the IMF) by BCEAO
headquarters. The authorities are now reporting monetary data to STA on a regular basis,
with a reduction in the lag from about six months to about three to four months. There has
also been an improvement in the timeliness of reporting interest rate and depository
corporation data. An area-wide page for the WAEMU zone was introduced in the
January 2003 issue of IFS.
9.
In 2005, the BCEAO made substantial revisions to the estimates of banknotes in
circulation in member states resulting from cross-border banknote movement. These
revisions were due to changes in the method to estimate currency in circulation in the
WAEMU countries. The revised method, based on updated sorting coefficients (“coefficients
de tri”), has been applied retroactively from December 2003.
10.
In August 2006, as part of the authorities’ efforts to implement the statistical
methodology recommended in the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual, the BCEAO
reported to STA test monetary data for June 2006 for all member countries using
Standardized Report Forms (1SR-central bank, 2SR-other depository corporations, and 5SRmonetary aggregates). In response to STA’s comments, the BCEAO has recently provided a
revised 1SR and indicated that 2SR is being revised.

12
External sector statistics
11.
Balance of payments statistics are compiled by the Senegalese national agency of the
BCEAO. With STA support over the past few years, several steps have been taken to address
certain shortcomings, including: (i) implementation of the Balance of Payments Manual, fifth
edition; (ii) modification and simplification of related surveys for companies and banks;
(iii) improvement in the computerization of procedures; and (iv) significant strengthening of
staff training. Nevertheless, further steps could be taken to enhance the quality and coverage
of the balance of payments statistics.
12.
Although definitive balance of payments statistics can now be provided with a delay
of less than one year, there are significant delays in reporting the data to STA. At this time,
balance of payment statistics up to the year 2004 and international investment position data
up to 2005 have been communicated to STA.

Senegal: Table of Common Indicators Required for Surveillance
(As of May 12, 2008)

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
June 18, 2008

1.
This statement summarizes developments in Senegal since the issuance of the
staff report. Over the past few weeks, the following information has become available,
which does not change the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Recent indications point to a risk of higher inflation. CPI inflation remained high
in the past two months. It slightly exceeded 5 percent year-on-year in April and reached
6 percent in May, with food prices contributing three-fourths of the increase. This could
delay the envisaged return to the historical inflation trend by 2009.
3.
A continued surge in oil prices could significantly affect Senegal’s balance of
payments but the impact on the budget would be limited. Using the May 2008 WEO
projections, the current account deficit could deteriorate by about 1¾ percent of GDP
compared to the staff report (see Table). If the authorities decided not to pass through the
higher oil bill to consumers by raising prices of electricity and butane gas, the overall fiscal
deficit would rise by about 0.2 percent of GDP. The WEO food price projections for 2008
have remained unchanged.

All structural conditions for the first program review are now in place. With a
two-month delay, the authorities completed, at end-May 2008, the submission of the
Treasury accounts for 2004 and 2005 to the audit court.
5.
The authorities have informed staff that another step has been taken to curtail
nonpriority spending in 2008. They have blocked commitment authorizations in the SIGFIP
expenditure tracking system, which would enable them to enforce the administrative orders

2
of the Prime Minister and Minister of Finance on the reduction in nonpriority spending
(paragraph 23 of the staff report).
6.
The authorities have launched tenders to issue government securities in the
regional financial market. The auctions seek to raise CFAF 40 billion in treasury bills with
maturities of up to two years and CFAF 60 billion in ten-year bonds. If successful, they
would allow the prompt settlement of the payment delays carried over from 2007 and help
remove a drag on the private sector.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
June 24, 2008

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with
Senegal
On June 18, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Senegal. 1
Background
Senegal, over the last decade, has achieved macroeconomic stability and recorded economic
growth above that in other West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) countries.
Buoyant activity in the services and construction sectors increased GDP growth in 2007 to 4¾
percent, from 2¼ percent in 2006. However, the agricultural sector experienced a second year
of output decline.
Rapidly rising energy and food prices raised inflation in 2007 and put pressure on the fiscal
and external accounts. Inflation reached 6 percent, the highest level since the 1994
devaluation. Value Added Tax (VAT) and customs duties on certain food products were
suspended in mid-2007, the subsidy on butane gas was gradually raised, and subsidies on
petroleum products were introduced in late 2007. This may have temporarily restrained
inflation, but the budgetary costs were substantial, at 1½ percent of GDP.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2

The overall fiscal deficit was kept at 3½ percent of GDP in 2007, after 6 percent of GDP a year
before. However, expenditure commitments equivalent to 2 percent of GDP have been carried
over for settlement in 2008, representing a significant stock of payment delays to the private
sector. Fiscal developments were marked by strong revenue collections and increased
spending allocations to social sectors.
The external current account deficit in 2007 increased to 10½ percent of GDP as the cost of
importing energy and food rose, but exports plateaued because restructuring of the phosphate
producer ICS (Industries Chimiques du Sénégal) was delayed and there were structural
obstacles that prevented Senegal from being more competitive. Current account financing
benefited from higher foreign direct investment (FDI) and receipts from the sale of a third
telecom license, which helped keep external debt indicators broadly unchanged from 2006.
Senegal’s macroeconomic policies are being pursued under an economic program supported
by the IMF’s Policy Support Instrument (PSI), which was approved in November 2007 (see
Press Release No. 07/246). The authorities’ program has four pillars: (i) containing the fiscal
deficit to underpin macroeconomic stability and safeguard debt sustainability; (ii) improving
fiscal governance and transparency so as to enhance policy credibility and sustain external
assistance; (iii) encouraging private sector activity by improving the business environment and
addressing structural impediments to higher economic growth and competitiveness; and
(iv) limiting financial sector vulnerabilities and raising the sector’s contribution to the economy.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Senegalese authorities on the broadly satisfactory
implementation of their economic program supported under the PSI. They noted that
Senegal’s macroeconomic performance had improved in 2007, with a recovery in growth,
although rising food and energy prices had increased inflation and put pressure on the fiscal
and external accounts.
Directors observed that Senegal’s overriding economic challenge was to raise growth and
reduce poverty. They encouraged the authorities to maintain prudent macroeconomic policies
and persevere in implementing their structural reforms under the Accelerated Growth Strategy.
This, together with energy sector reform, continued efforts to attract FDI, and targeted
government spending in infrastructure, health, and education, would encourage private sectorled growth, raise external competitiveness, and strengthen and diversify exports.
Directors agreed that Senegal’s real exchange rate does not appear to be overvalued,
although developments require close monitoring. They considered that Senegal’s sluggish
export performance over the last decade was largely related to structural impediments in the
economy, and encouraged the authorities to improve the business environment to make it
more conducive to private sector activity by accelerating governance and structural reforms.

3
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to fiscal sustainability. They underlined that it
was critical to contain the fiscal deficit to preserve debt sustainability, respect the limited
financing capacity of the regional financial market, and contain demand pressures, thereby
promoting domestic stability in the context of Senegal’s monetary union membership. Directors
commended the authorities for their continued good revenue performance, which helped
support fiscal sustainability. In addition, they welcomed the planned strengthening of tax
administration, including the transfer of responsibility for direct tax collections from the
Treasury to the Revenue Authority.
Directors supported the authorities’ intention to correct the 2007 fiscal slippages, and stressed
that it will be crucial to reign in non-priority capital and current spending in 2008 in order to
make room for the settlement of expenditure commitments from 2007. Directors urged the
careful review and expeditious settlement of payment delays, with a view to rigorously applying
the existing budget framework.
Directors recognized the potential of the planned Dakar Integrated Special Economic Zone in
generating growth and employment, but emphasized the need to avoid any loss of tax
revenues from domestic enterprises moving to the zone and to put in place the necessary
safeguards to combat tax fraud and evasion.
Directors noted that international food and energy price increases had placed a considerable
burden on the population, and concurred with the authorities that measures should be taken to
shield the population’s most vulnerable segments from these price increases. Directors saw
scope for improving the targeting of the existing measures while minimizing economic
distortions and keeping them affordable so that they remained consistent with macroeconomic
stability and debt sustainability. For the longer term, they recommended the introduction of a
social safety net. In addition, Directors encouraged the authorities to promote the development
of the agricultural sector.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to continue public financial management
reform and to improve financial sector supervision in the regional context. In particular, given
Senegal’s emphasis on public investment to support economic growth, they encouraged the
authorities to further strengthen their investment planning and evaluation to focus on highreturn projects and raise the productivity of government spending. In this context, Directors
agreed that the nonconcessional borrowing that the authorities intend to undertake to help
finance the Dakar-Diamniadio toll road is appropriate in light of its projected high return and
the lack of other financing sources. In addition, they urged a strong implementation of the new
public procurement framework.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Completes the First Review Under the Policy Support
Instrument (PSI) for Senegal
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the first
review under a three-year Policy Support Instrument (PSI) for Senegal. The Board also
granted a waiver for the nonobservance of the continuous quantitative assessment criterion
on the stock of domestic payment arrears by the government, noting that the authorities had
taken action quickly to remedy the nonobservance.
The PSI for Senegal was approved on November 2, 2007 (see Press Release No. 07/246) and
is aimed at consolidating macroeconomic stability, increasing the country's growth potential,
and reducing poverty. The program focuses on maintaining a sound fiscal policy stance and
enhancing fiscal governance and transparency. It also includes measures to develop the
private sector and increase the financial sector's contribution to growth.
Following the Executive Board's discussion on Senegal, Mr. Murilo Portugal, Deputy
Managing Director and Chairman, stated:
“Senegal’s economic growth recovered in 2007, but rapidly rising food and energy prices
raised inflation and put pressure on the fiscal and external accounts. The main challenges for
the Senegalese authorities are to further raise economic growth, maintain macroeconomic
stability, and reduce vulnerabilities.
“The removal of structural impediments to economic growth is key to fostering private
sector-led growth, raising external competitiveness, and strengthening and diversifying
exports. In this context, the Senegalese authorities are encouraged to put in place the
structural reforms envisaged under their Accelerated Growth Strategy. In addition,
implementation of energy sector reform, continued efforts to attract foreign direct
investment, and targeted government spending in infrastructure, health, and education, will
be conducive to raising Senegal’s growth potential.
“The authorities’ emphasis on safeguarding fiscal sustainability underpins the economic
program supported under the PSI. The envisaged medium-term fiscal adjustment path will
help preserve debt sustainability, respect the limited financing capacity of the regional
financial market, and contain demand pressures, thereby promoting domestic stability in the
context of Senegal’s monetary union membership. Measures to safeguard Senegal’s

2

traditionally strong revenue performance, including with respect to the planned Dakar
Integrated Special Economic Zone, will help shore up fiscal sustainability.
“The authorities have committed to correct the 2007 fiscal slippages, and have decided to
rein in non-priority capital and current spending in 2008 in order to allow for the settlement
of the 2007 expenditure commitments. Priority should now be given to rapidly completing a
careful review of these commitments, settling them expeditiously, and rigorously applying
the existing budget framework.
“International food and energy price increases are placing a considerable burden on the
population, in particular the most vulnerable segments. It is important to ensure that the
policy measures to alleviate this burden are affordable, well targeted, and nondistortionary.
Implementation of the new electricity tariff structure would help recover costs and at the
same time favor low-income households. In the long run, the implementation of an effective
social safety net should be considered.
“Given the tight budgetary constraints, it will be essential to further strengthen investment
planning and evaluation and focus on high-return projects to raise the productivity of
government investment. In implementing their investment program, the authorities
appropriately rely on concessional financial resources so as to preserve debt sustainability,”
Mr. Portugal said.

The IMF's framework for PSIs is designed for low-income countries that may not need, or
want, IMF financial assistance, but still seek IMF advice, monitoring and endorsement of
their policies. PSIs are voluntary and demand driven. PSI-supported programs are based on
country-owned poverty reduction strategies adopted in a participatory process involving
civil society and development partners and articulated in a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
(PRSP). This is intended to ensure that PSI-supported programs are consistent with a
comprehensive framework for macroeconomic, structural and social policies to foster
growth and reduce poverty. Members' performance under a PSI is reviewed semi-annually,
irrespective of the status of the program (see Public Information Notice No. 05/145).

Statement by Laurean Rutayisire, Executive Director for Senegal
June 18, 2008
1.
We thank staff for the comprehensive reports on Senegal and for the productive
policy discussions held with the country’s authorities during the mission for the first Policy
Support Instrument (PSI) review and the 2008 Article IV consultation. We are appreciative
of the useful advice the staff has continued to provide to the authorities in support of their
efforts to overcome the policy challenges facing the country and we acknowledge the
valuable role played by Management and the Board in this process. Keeping up with their
attachment to transparency, the authorities have consented to the Fund publication of their
letter of intent and the staff report.
2.
As discussed in the staff report and below, the authorities’ implementation of the
PSI structural conditionality and quantitative conditions has been almost perfect to date. In
addition to signaling the authorities’ strong ownership of, and their commitment to, the
program’s objectives and reform agenda, this impressive performance should put to rest
doubts previously expressed by a few Directors about the qualification of Senegal for the
status of mature stabilizer and good PSI candidate. Notwithstanding the significant progress
made in the implementation of their reform agenda, the authorities are aware that key policy
challenges remain to be tackled. They are determined to continue their reform efforts and, in
this endeavor, they will continue to welcome the Fund’s useful advice.
ECONOMIC AND STRUCTURAL PERFORMANCE UNDER THE PSI AND ECONOMIC OUTLOOK
3.
In 2007, a number of developments are noteworthy on the macroeconomic front.
Reflecting the dynamism of the Senegalese economy, particularly in the secondary and
tertiary sectors, the rate of GDP growth doubled compared to the previous year, reaching
almost 5 percent. Higher energy and food prices continued, however, to take a big toll on
inflation and the current account deficit which rose to about 6 percent and 10 percent
respectively. In spite of these shocks which, from the authorities’ standpoint, justified
granting additional subsidies and introducing temporary tax exemptions on a limited number
of consumption goods, the authorities succeeded in meeting the targeted basic fiscal balance
and reducing the overall fiscal deficit. However, given the strong budgetary pressures in the
face of several competing priority needs and the inflexibility of the targeted basic fiscal
balance, these achievements came at the cost of the timeliness of the issuance of some
payment orders and unfulfilled spending commitments even though expenditures in priority
sectors were increased.
4.
In line with the authorities’ strong commitment to sound macroeconomic policies,
all quantitative assessment criteria were met, except for the one on domestic payment arrears
which was inadvertently missed during the first few weeks of the program period. However,

2
in view of the corrective action they have taken, the authorities are hopeful that Directors will
support their request for waiver of the assessment criterion.
5.
In addition to the prowess they have demonstrated on the macroeconomic front,
the authorities have shown a determined implementation of their structural reform agenda.
Indeed, the single-worded comments in Table 9 of the staff report convey a clear sense of the
impressive implementation of the PSI reform agenda, with virtually all of the dozen of
structural conditions set for the PSI review being met. With respect to the sole condition that
was partially met, the authorities have renewed their commitment to submit to the audit court
the complete 2004 and 2005 Treasury accounts.
6.
The authorities remain optimistic about the country’s economic outlook. Growth
prospects are favorable given the expected continuous dynamism of the construction sector
and services. Thanks to the regional central bank’s prudent policies, core inflation is
expected to be kept low going forward. External current account balance is expected to
fluctuate around its current level and to be partly improved by the implementation of the new
restructuring plan of the chemical company, Industries Chimiques du Senegal, which is
expected to pave the way for full recovery of the company, thereby boosting exports. As
many spending commitments made in 2007 are expected to be settled this year, the fiscal
deficit is expected to increase before following a downward path in 2009 onwards.
POLICY AND REFORM AGENDA FOR 2008-2009
7.
The authorities have thus far made significant strides in advancing the reform and
policy agenda they have elaborated in the context of the PSI program, with staff’s valuable
assistance. Still, they are fully aware that much remains to be done to overcome the
significant challenges facing the country, notably coping with rising food and energy prices,
sustaining improvement in fiscal governance and transparency, and advancing the remaining
reform agenda.
Coping with Food and energy price shocks
8.
Rising food and energy prices has been a key challenge facing the Senegalese
authorities both on the policy and social fronts. As in many other countries, this shock has
triggered an outburst of consumers’ outcry in Senegal. As the authorities attach high priority
to mitigating the adverse impact of the shock on social welfare, the initial policy response
consisted in a series of actions that included suspension of indirect taxes and customs duties
on a few food products as well as energy subsidies, thus contributing to fueling existing
pressures on the budget. However, determined not to let these measures come at the expense
of macroeconomic stability and fiscal sustainability, the authorities subsequently took
vigorous steps to rationalize public spending in nonpriority sectors and address payment
delays while safeguarding public expenditures in social sectors. Most notably, the

3
administrative orders sent last month by the Prime Minister and the Minister of Economy and
Finance to all line ministries were meant to serve these purposes.
9.
Going forward, the authorities also intend to elaborate mechanisms for better
targeting this assistance to the most vulnerable households. In this process, staff analysis of
the policies to protect the poor from rising energy and food prices will be of great interest.
They will aim to achieve higher agricultural production and lower production costs in the
energy sector which they view as medium-term solutions to these shocks. Several initiatives
are already underway in this connection, including infrastructure development and
productivity-enhancing measures in both the agricultural and energy sectors and the
recapitalization of the electricity company. At the regional level, they will take part to efforts
that WAEMU finance ministers recently agreed to undertake in order to cope with increases
in food and energy prices.
Sustaining Improvements in Fiscal Governance and Transparency
10.
As we noted during last Board discussions on Senegal, the authorities had started
to take steps toward improving fiscal governance and transparency and reducing fiscal risks.
Those steps included, inter alia, disclosure of the contracts signed by the government, notably
with the project company, AIBD, the construction company, banks, and the International Air
Transport Association (IATA); full public ownership of AIBD; publication of the amount of
airport tax revenues collected through IATA; enactment of a new procurement code which
limits recourse to no-bid contracts in the public sector; and modification of the legal status of
the Agency for investment promotion and major public projects, APIX. Since then, other big
leaps have been made in the same direction, notably by modifying the legal status of the
Agency for investment promotion and major public projects, APIX, containing energy
subsidies, and lifting the government’s guarantee on ICS debt to local banks.
11.
Going forward, the authorities’ aspiration for improved fiscal governance and
transparency will be served by further steps they plan to take in the coming months. In
particular, starting from the end of this month, government contracts awarded each quarter
will be put in the public domain and subjected to audits. Butane gas subsidies will be
significantly reduced this year and capped at CFAF 32 billion, consistent with the authorities’
intent to gradually eliminate them in the medium-term.
12.
The authorities are determined to promptly settle any payment delays and extrabudgetary spending that may have occurred. A full account of such delays and spending is
expected to be made soon by the financial audit inspectorate of the finance ministry. The
authorities will also take a number of further steps aimed at strengthening the budgetary
framework, smooth the different phases of budget execution, and improve budget
monitoring, including by introducing ceilings on the stock of budgetary float. In view of their
large infrastructure program and in line with their previous commitment, the authorities will

4
work, in coming months, on elaborating guidelines to strengthen public investment planning
and evaluation.
13.
Furthermore, the authorities’ plan to implement measures aimed at enhancing the
already highly performing tax administration bodes well for the prospects of revenue
mobilization. These measures include connecting the information systems of the main taxcollecting offices and streamlining of direct tax collection responsibilities between the
treasury and the tax department.
Further Advancing the Reform Agenda
14.
The authorities continue to abide by their commitment to ensure that the planned
Special Economic Zone is at least revenue neutral and has no adverse impact of the equity of
the fiscal system. To that resolve they have finalized a comprehensive study on the fiscal
incidence of the Special Economic Zone. The study analyzes many fiscal implications of the
project, particularly on the legal, institutional and economic fronts. They also plan to take
specific actions in 2009 that will include: identification of enterprises and sectors that will be
authorized to operate in the Zone; sanctions to be effected in case of violations of the Zone’s
laws and regulations; and clear delineation of the roles of the Zone’s governing body and the
tax and customs Directorates.

With regard to the financial sector, the authorities will continue to pursue their
previously stated objectives, notably improvement of the soundness of the sector and SMEs’
credit access. For the coming months, their reform agenda will thus include, inter alia,
implementing the new legal framework for the microfinance sector, continuing to build
capacity of the finance ministry’s unit in charge of supervising the sector, submitting to
Parliament the new regional law against the financing of terrorism, and establishing a
program of regular issuance of government securities.
16.
The authorities’ reform efforts continue to encompass other macrocritical sectors,
as well. In particular, work is underway to increase private sector’s involvement in the
governance of the energy sector. In the case of the electricity company, SENELEC, such
work is being conducted with the assistance of the World Bank. Major reforms are also being
conducted by the authorities to make the economy fast-growing and competitive. An
institutional framework for implementing the authorities’ Accelerated Growth Strategy has
been adopted and critical reforms to improve the business climate are underway. Partly
reflecting the effectiveness of such reforms, the country is attracting increasingly significant
FDI and positioning itself as a major investment pole in the region.

ADDITIONAL REMARKS AND CONCLUSION
17.
The authorities would welcome more flexibility in the program fiscal targets. As
noted above, their effort to meet the target for the basic fiscal balance was viewed as one of
the causes of the distortions that affected budget execution last year, notably by contributing
to delays in the issuance of payment orders and unfulfilled spending commitments. While
such a situation may require from the authorities better consideration of budgetary ceilings, it
also provides a rationale for ensuring more flexibility in fiscal targets set Senegal’s PSI and
Fund-supported programs in general. Occasional departures from a tight fiscal stance should
be allowed from the authorities’ perspective so long as long-term fiscal sustainability is
preserved. This would allow programs not only to better accommodate unexpected shocks
and critical infrastructure needs, and thus growth objectives, but also not to introduce any
distortions in budget execution processes.
18.
In a bid to preserve debt sustainability, the Senegalese authorities remain
committed to sound debt management and they continue to have a strong preference for
contracting and guaranteeing external loans on concessional terms. However, the
increasingly limited availability of concessional loans and grants is becoming more and more
at odds with their growing needs for such resources with a view to financing their
infrastructure development needs. This partly motivates the following requests they have
submitted for Fund consideration. First, they add their voice to that of other authorities in our
Constituency who have previously made calls for the Fund to revisit the definition of
concessionality in its arrangements, ultimately with the aim at lowering possibly the required
minimum grant element. Such a move would help countries like Senegal mobilize additional
development financing and would naturally continue to require strict monitoring of the
impact of new borrowing on debt sustainability, as is already the case.
19.
Second, the authorities appreciate the new nonzero program ceiling on the
contracting or guaranteeing of new nonconcessional external debt which accommodates one
of their high priority projects, the Dakar-Diamniado toll highway. For future reference, they
would appreciate it if the Fund would find ways to allow the PSI program to respond more
swiftly to a need for upward adjustment in the ceiling on nonconcessional financing when
concessional resources and grants are unavailable to finance priority development projects
for which associated returns exceed the cost of nonconcessional borrowing. They view a
protracted consultation process with staff in the run-up to such an adjustment as
counterproductive and at odds with the needs of a dynamic economy.
20.
In light of the above, we call on Directors to consider favorably the authorities’
requests and to support completion of the first review of the PSI program.
