STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
AND PROPOSAL FOR POST-PROGRAM MONITORING

KEY ISSUES
Context: Notable progress has been achieved in recent years, on both the policy and
macroeconomic fronts. Challenges remain, however, including in the near term elevated
inflation and slowing, yet resilient, growth. The current account deficit is narrowing, but
exports and FDI are lower than expected. Safeguarding macroeconomic stability and
launching a new phase of structural reforms would facilitate ambitious medium-term
development goals.
Fiscal policy: Reducing high public debt levels requires continued fiscal consolidation.
Staff supports the authorities’ 5.8 percent of GDP budget deficit target for 2013. A
critical issue is strengthening the revenue system to support consolidation while making
space for capital investment and key social spending in order to sustain robust and
inclusive growth. A second generation of tax reform focused on base broadening and
improving administration is needed. Addressing losses at state-owned energy
companies requires a comprehensive approach.
Monetary and exchange rate policy: With inflation elevated and growth slowing,
monetary policy is facing a challenging task. Policy was eased recently. Further stimulus
should remain on hold until inflation pressures decline. Moving toward a flexible
inflation targeting framework would provide a nominal anchor for monetary policy in the
context of exchange rate flexibility.
Financial stability: The FSAP update recognized progress made in strengthening banking
supervision and financial soundness indicators are strong. However, rapid credit expansion
in recent years justifies heightened vigilance for systemic vulnerabilities. Annual stress
tests and raising capital buffers in banks exposed to notable credit risks, more robust
consolidated supervision and macroprudential frameworks, and development of pension
and crisis preparedness frameworks would help cement financial stability.
Strengthening trade and broadening growth: Exports have declined significantly as a
share of GDP and world exports since 2000. Deeper integration with the world economy,
attracting FDI, and a more enabling environment for exports and the private sector
would broaden the sources of growth and enhance external resilience. Important
measures include reducing policy barriers, continuing to expand infrastructure and
improve the business climate, reforming the trade tariff structure, and sustaining
exchange rate flexibility.

CONTEXT
1.
Sri Lanka has achieved notable progress on a number of economic fronts in recent
years, although there have also been challenges. While slowing recently, growth has been
generally robust, fiscal consolidation has taken place, and poverty and inequality have declined
(Box 1). Other aspects of Sri Lanka’s development agenda, however, require ongoing effort. Revenue
growth has not responded as envisaged to a first round of tax reforms, undermining capital
investment plans; despite recent appropriate price adjustments, state-owned enterprises remain
prone to large losses; and the current account deficit remains elevated and financed mainly through
debt-creating flows.
2.
The authorities are keen to broaden and deepen economic development, building on
the achievements of the recently completed Stand-By Arrangement with the Fund. The
President’s second five-year plan aims to raise per capita incomes by a third to US$4,000 in 2016
with real growth of 8 percent per annum. Sustaining robust and inclusive growth will require
maintaining macroeconomic stability, with particular near-term attention to inflation risks, as well as
structural reforms. Priorities include: a second generation of tax reform to create fiscal space for
higher investment and critical social expenditures while supporting fiscal consolidation; re-orienting
the monetary policy framework toward achieving low and stable inflation under exchange rate
flexibility; broadening and refining frameworks to safeguard financial stability and deepen markets;
and addressing structural impediments to trade and private sector growth.
3.
Response to past advice. The authorities have implemented a range of policies consistent
with previous Fund policy advice and meeting program conditionality. They embarked on a
challenging fiscal consolidation path with a first round of tax reforms and expenditure containment,
including reducing defense spending as a share of GDP. However, the pace and quality of fiscal
adjustment fell short of ambitious plans, and tax rate reductions generally took precedence over
base broadening, while cost-recovery pricing at state-owned energy companies has yet to emerge.
The exchange rate was allowed greater flexibility, albeit after a costly delay. Good progress was
made in strengthening bank supervision and regulation, and deposit insurance was introduced, but
pension regulation frameworks were not addressed. The investment regime was improved, though
exemptions remain prevalent.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK, AND RISKS
4.
Real GDP growth slowed in 2012, while inflation rose. Policies were tightened in a bold
policy package and the exchange rate was allowed to depreciate in early 2012 to rein in credit and
import growth and stabilize international reserves. At the same time, spillovers from weak global
growth undermined exports, and drought, followed by floods, adversely affected agriculture. Real
growth slowed to 6.4 percent in 2012. Following an upward shift due to exchange rate pass through
and higher food and administered prices, headline inflation hovered near double digits for most of
the year, before easing to 7½ percent year-on-year in March 2013 due mainly to base effects. Core
inflation trended upward, and inflation expectations and private sector wage demands have risen.

5.
Fiscal policy remained tight, although less so than budgeted. The government’s 2012
budget deficit is estimated to have fallen to about 6½ percent of GDP (above the budget’s
6¼ percent target) due to expenditure restraint and payment arrears. Revenues were significantly
lower than budgeted, partly reflecting the introduction of new tax exemptions, lower imports that
undermined VAT, and weaker-than-expected income taxes. Losses at the state-owned Ceylon
Electricity Board (CEB) and Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) rose to around 2 percent of GDP in
2012 despite significant domestic price increases, as drought induced a shift in electricity generation
away from inexpensive hydroelectric to expensive thermal sources.
6.
Monetary policy has eased in recent months. With activity and credit growth slowing, the
Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) allowed the credit ceiling to expire and reduced its policy rate
corridor in early-December by 25 basis points to 7½–9½ percent. Overnight interest rates have
subsequently fallen by about 100 basis points as call money rates were guided down to the middle of
the corridor. Treasury bill and bond rates have declined by more, reflecting expectations of further
policy easing and healthy foreign demand for rupee-denominated government debt. Sovereign
spreads narrowed through late-2012, but have since widened somewhat.
7.
The balance of payments has stabilized, and after
depreciating sharply early last year, the rupee has
rebounded somewhat. The current account deficit declined
to around 6½ percent of GDP in 2012 as falling imports—
particularly consumer goods—more than offset falling
exports, while tourism and remittances remained robust.
Foreign direct investment (FDI) was less than half of the
authorities’ expectations. Gross official international reserves
reached around US$6¾ billion (3½ months of imports) in
early 2013.

Box 1. Sri Lanka: Growth Inclusiveness and Poverty Reduction

Staff estimates suggest that despite generally stronger
economic growth, less-developed provinces did not exhibit
consistently higher elasticities of poverty reduction
(proportional change in poverty per unit growth in GDP
per capita). Indeed, the elasticity of poverty reduction
during 2007–10 appears to have been strongest in the
Western province (second table). To support inclusive
growth and poverty reduction going forward, higher
poverty-reduction elasticities and continued robust growth
in less-developed regions are imperative. For this to occur,
inflation must be contained, and economic development
policies should provide for a continued expansion of
infrastructure, access to health and education services, and
improvements in the investment environment to support
private sector growth.

Reflecting robust growth, the national poverty headcount
ratio fell to just below 9 percent in 2010 from over
15 percent in 2006/07. Spatially, poverty rates declined
across most of the country. Declining inequality has also
accompanied poverty reduction (first table). Nevertheless,
poverty rates remain relatively high in less-developed
provinces, with fewer labor market opportunities and
generally higher costs, placing them at a competitive
disadvantage (second chart).

A period of strong economic growth that began in the

Moreover, the poorer provinces, the Northern province in
particular, experienced relatively stronger overall economic
growth after the end of the civil conflict. The country’s
richest Western province, home to its capital city Colombo,
grew a robust 6.5 percent per annum (first chart).

8.
Financial soundness indicators are strong, although some softening is evident. The
system-wide capital adequacy ratio declined by 1 percentage point from a year ago to 15 percent in
December 2012, but it remains above the 10 percent regulatory minimum. Profitability and liquidity
are robust, and gross nonperforming loans (NPLs) eased slightly to 3½ percent of total loans.
However, stress tests undertaken during the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) update
indicated that credit risks bear scrutiny.
9.
Growth is projected at around 6¼ percent in 2013. A moderately contractionary budget
and the lagged impact of tight monetary conditions and real wage compression should restrain
domestic demand, while external demand is projected to remain tepid. Recent monetary policy
easing should support growth toward the end of the year. Based on this outlook, a small excess
supply gap would emerge (Box 2). Inflation pressures would moderate through the year, although
headline inflation would be affected if domestic energy prices are increased further. The current
account deficit should narrow further reflecting the impact of depreciation and restrained domestic
demand, and continued tourism and remittance inflows. Under the staff’s baseline scenario, external
and public debt dynamics are sustainable, though sensitive to the current account outlook and
shocks to contingent liabilities (see debt sustainability analysis supplement).
10.
Near-term risks are on the downside. Tax revenue weakness is a key risk to macroeconomic
stability. The balance of payments, reserve accumulation, and growth are vulnerable to a weakerthan-anticipated global environment, particularly in Europe and the United States, Sri Lanka’s largest
export markets. Inflation pressures could fail to moderate if inflation expectations continue to rise,
while higher oil prices would worsen CEB-CPC losses. Banks’ asset quality may deteriorate.

Box 2. Sri Lanka: Potential Growth
Staff estimates suggest Sri Lanka’s potential output
growth is about 6¾ percent in the near term. A range
of empirical approaches to estimating potential
growth suggest that it has risen by almost
1 percentage point in recent years compared to the
period 2003–08. This appears to reflect equally capital
deepening and improved factor productivity, with
labor’s contribution broadly unchanged.
Total factor productivity (TFP) growth accounted for
about half of Sri Lanka’s growth over the last decade
contributing on average 3¼ percentage points per
year, rising to about 3½ percentage points recently.
Going forward, TFP growth and capital deepening are
expected to remain key potential growth drivers, in
part reflecting public investment, while labor’s
contribution remains modest, in part reflecting
population aging.
The opening of the Eastern and Northern provinces
following the end of the conflict likely contributed a
marginal boost to potential. Growth in those provinces
raised overall real GDP growth by an average of about
¼ of a percentage point per year during 2010–11, with
staff estimates suggesting this mostly reflected the
service sector and to a lesser extent agriculture.
Sustaining a robust medium-term contribution to
growth would require rapid productivity gains in those
regions.
Excess demand emerged in 2010–11. Real GDP growth
was primarily driven by private consumption, while
investments’ contribution rose to just over 3 percent of
GDP from an average of 2½ percent during 2004–08.
Estimates based on methodologies that incorporate
information regarding cyclical demand factors suggest
that the output gap should close around end-2012. An
excess supply gap would open with below-potential
growth in 2013, helping to reduce inflation pressures
and the current account deficit.

The authorities expect growth of 7½ percent in 2013, supported by monetary easing,
the removal of the credit ceiling, and infrastructure investments. They felt confident that such
growth would be consistent with inflation falling to mid-single digits toward end-2013. Moreover,
they underscored the importance of the peace dividend from the end of the conflict in boosting
potential output growth. The authorities agreed there were some downside risks to the outlook,
owing to the global environment, however these were seen as manageable.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
12.
Policy discussions focused on the near-term macroeconomic stance; measures to achieve
a high-quality fiscal consolidation; strengthening the monetary policy framework under exchange
rate flexibility; safeguarding financial stability; and reforms to strengthen the external sector and
broaden growth.

A. Fiscal Policy and State Enterprise Reform
13.
Fiscal consolidation remains a key policy priority. Public debt is currently around
80 percent of GDP and over 600 percent of tax revenues, making it one of the highest among
emerging market economies. In 2013, the budget targets a 5.8 percent of GDP deficit, the lowest
since 1977. The stance is appropriately contractionary, and should help moderate inflation pressures
and contribute to external strengthening. However, deficit reduction continues to rely on
constraining expenditure growth, to offset a drag from weak revenues (Box 3). Reducing the deficit
below 5 percent of GDP over the medium term is central for debt sustainability.
14.
Tax revenues have been declining as a percent of GDP for years, and are now low by
international standards. In 2011, the authorities implemented a first round of reforms involving
rationalizing taxes, rate reductions and some base broadening. Notwithstanding, the tax revenue-toGDP ratio is estimated to have fallen to just over 11 percent in 2012, lower than most regional peers
(Figure 1).

Public investment is also low compared to
countries that have experienced sustained high
growth. Fiscal consolidation in the context of revenue
weakness has resulted in low investment plans, and
recently shortfalls relative to those plans. Tax holidays
and concessions have not delivered the expected
increase in FDI inflows (see below). Evidence from
emerging Asia points to relatively strong government
investment multipliers, indicating that increased
infrastructure investment to remove bottlenecks and
broaden growth is important if the authorities’
ambitious growth objectives are to be realized.

A high-quality fiscal consolidation that makes space for increased spending on
infrastructure while safeguarding critical social expenditures—to support inclusive robust
growth and further gains in equality and poverty reduction—will require reversing the decline
in tax revenues. The 2013 budget contained several

Box 3. Sri Lanka: Fiscal Stance Analysis
While stronger growth contributed to recent years’ deficit reduction, most of the decline reflects structural effort:
the cyclically adjusted deficit fell from 9.5 percent of GDP in 2009 to a projected 6.6 percent in 2012.
Deficit reduction was driven exclusively by lower spending, which fell by over 4 percent of GDP. Lower capital
spending contributed about one-fourth, while the balance was due to lower current spending. Lower interest
payments by over 1 percent of GDP helped, but the biggest contribution came from cuts in primary current
spending, which fell by 2 percent of GDP, reflecting cuts in military spending and lower subsidies. At the same
time, tax revenues have been declining as percent of GDP, by about 1½ percentage points, creating headwinds to
deficit reduction.
As the cyclically adjusted balance strengthened, the fiscal stance shifted from highly expansionary to
1
contractionary in 2012. The 2013 budget targets further deficit reduction and would imply a continued fiscal
contraction—an appropriate stance. However, the contractionary fiscal stance has been the result of two opposite
developments: an increasingly restrictive expenditure stance, and an increasingly expansionary revenue stance.

Taking 2005 as the base year with neutral fiscal stance, the year the estimated output gap was smallest.

17.
Staff proposed comprehensive reforms to broaden the tax base, simplify the system,
and strengthen administration:


To broaden the base: (i) further expand VAT coverage of the wholesale and retail sectors, with
the long-term objective of repealing the Nation Building Tax—a cascading indirect tax using a
similar base to the VAT; (ii) value all existing tax holidays and exemptions, and subsequently
rationalize costly or ineffective ones, or convert them to accelerated depreciation or investment
tax credits linked to investment amounts; and (iii) introduce a single and simplified small
taxpayer regime for businesses under the VAT threshold.



To simplify the system and strengthen administration: (i) implement a comprehensive risk-based
VAT refund management system to replace the existing procedure; (ii) streamline and
restructure the Inland Revenue Department along functional lines; (iii) strengthen the Large
Taxpayer Unit; and (iv) improve audits and compliance risk management.

18.
The authorities emphasized their commitment to keep the 2013 deficit at 5.8 percent
of GDP, and to reduce it below 5 percent in the medium term, with the aim of reducing public debt
to around 60 percent of GDP. Given lower-than-expected tax revenues in 2012, they acknowledged
that the budgeted revenue increase in 2013 is likely out of reach. They are determined to meet the
deficit target by reducing expenditure. The authorities reported that as there was less scope for
lowering current spending, capital spending would be the focus of reductions.
19.
The authorities agreed that higher tax revenues hold the key to successful mediumterm fiscal consolidation. However, to maintain a stable tax policy regime, they are not prepared
to take revenue measures in 2013 beyond those announced in the budget. Any new measures could
be implemented in the 2014 budget at the earliest. The authorities argued that, to some extent,
poor revenue performance reflected temporary effects of measures to curb imports and strengthen
the external position. But they explained that a further refinement of VAT coverage of the wholesale
and retail sectors is under consideration, and acknowledged the need to monitor closely and
eventually reassess the modalities of the VAT refund system.
20.
A more accountable and effective public financial management (PFM) system would
complement fiscal consolidation. Core PFM processes are fairly robust; however, more advanced
practices are now appropriate, commensurate with Sri Lanka’s move to middle-income status.
Reforms should be guided by the roadmap developed with IMF technical assistance: building on
progress made in updating the legal and regulatory framework; improving budget preparation,
including development of a medium-term rolling budget framework; and strengthening budget
execution, including recording and reporting of commitments and arrears, oversight and monitoring
of public enterprises, and more efficient cash management.
21.
The authorities welcomed the PFM recommendations. They are developing an oversight
and reporting framework for state-owned enterprises, and are updating financial regulations to
modernize the financial administration framework, with IMF technical assistance.

Staff emphasized the need to address structural shortcomings undermining the longterm commercial viability of the CPC and CEB. These companies’ large losses are unsustainable.
At the same time, electricity prices are high by regional standards. A comprehensive approach is
required, including better management, lowering electricity generation costs, raising efficiency, and
moving toward cost-recovery pricing, followed by adoption of an automatic price adjustment
mechanism. Staff also emphasized the need for targeted social protection measures to mitigate the
impact of higher prices on the poor.
23.
The authorities attach high priority to addressing the losses of CEB and CPC. Diesel and
petrol prices were recently increased, and there are plans to increase electricity tariffs and to
implement cost-recovery pricing for heavy fuels.

B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
24.
A cautious monetary policy stance remains appropriate. The tight stance through most
of 2012 was effective in addressing imbalances. Growth slowed, and imports and private sector
credit growth have moderated. Nevertheless, headline and core inflation are elevated, private sector
wage demands are rising, and with further domestic energy price hikes under consideration, risks of
second-round effects exist. Monetary policy should remain on hold until stronger evidence emerges
that inflation pressures have begun to dissipate.
25.
Flexible inflation targeting would provide a more coherent framework for conducting
monetary policy. Economic, price, and financial stability are the CBSL’s ultimate objectives. The
operational framework employs reserve and broad money targets, although monetary policy had
earlier focused on maintaining exchange rate stability, which contributed to imbalances—reflecting
both the loss of the exchange rate as a buffer for external shocks and, at times, domestic liquidity
conditions inconsistent with external stability. Striving toward a flexible inflation targeting regime
that gives weight to inflation as a nominal anchor, while also considering policy’s impact on growth,
would help clarify objectives and eventually anchor inflation expectations in a more coherent policy
framework under continued exchange rate flexibility. Initial steps could embrace developing an
overarching strategy and related institutional arrangements, and technical and operational capacity
to better understand the inflation process and transmission mechanism.
26.
The authorities concurred that monetary policy should remain on hold in the near
term. They also underscored the need to monitor credit growth closely to avoid an undue credit
expansion. At the same time, they indicated that weaker-than-expected economic or credit growth
would warrant a further easing of monetary conditions. They indicated their desire to move toward
flexible inflation targeting, but expressed concern that it could be difficult to communicate to the
public. They are working toward implementing some technical elements, but emphasized the need
to develop a nominal anchor that would allow flexibility in ensuring monetary policy would continue
to have an important role in supporting growth.
27.
Improving monetary operations would strengthen the policy transmission mechanism.
Liquidity management has mainly relied on overnight open market operations, which were

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SRI LANKA

occasionally suspended in favor of the standing facilities. As a consequence, periods of excess
structural liquidity arose, reducing interest rate control and weakening the transmission mechanism.
Improved liquidity monitoring and management is needed. Structural liquidity should be monitored
and the use of longer-term liquidity operations expanded, with overnight operations used for finetuning purposes. Banks’ liquidity management could be improved by strengthening the statutory
reserve requirement system.
28.
The authorities agreed to closely monitor liquidity in the banking system. They also
plan to lengthen the statutory reserve maintenance period. However, they were of the view that
longer-term operations earned at higher interest rates would not be effective in addressing
structural liquidity management issues.

should be maintained for the real exchange rate to
move into line with fundamentals, while the CBSL
should seize opportunities to increase reserves further.
Source: IMF staff estimates.
Moreover, deepening the foreign exchange market
would enhance efficiency and support a less active role for the CBSL. Limits introduced in early-2012
on banks’ forward transactions were eased and those on net open positions (NOP) were partially
rolled back. However, NOP limits remain significantly tighter than in other countries, limiting risk
hedging opportunities and market development. Government guarantees under consideration for
offshore wholesale bank funding should be avoided, as they raise contingent fiscal liabilities and
debt sustainability risks, and incentivize reduced exchange rate flexibility.

30.
The authorities viewed the current exchange rate as broadly in line with fundamentals.
They noted that substantial foreign exchange purchases in recent months suggested no
overvaluation. Given the thin foreign exchange market, the CBSL would need to stand ready to
intervene when necessary to prevent disorderly movements. While reserves were broadly
appropriate at this juncture, the CBSL would over the medium term seek opportunities to build them
further, but the authorities noted they would not sacrifice macroeconomic fundamentals in order to
achieve any particular target. They saw NOP limits as appropriate to prevent excessive speculation.

Staff’s overall assessment is that the external position would

base will be essential to ensure sustainability and limit
vulnerabilities stemming from the relatively high public and
external debt ratios.

While Sri Lanka’s foreign exchange reserves have increased in
recent months, coverage still appears somewhat low when
judged by several commonly used metrics, and compared to
other countries in the region. While above three months of
prospective imports of goods and services, reserves are low
relative to short-term debt and prospective amortization, and
just below the IMF’s new composite metric adequacy range
1
for countries with a floating exchange rate regime.

Capital account flows have been rather disappointing, as the
large FDI inflows predicted at the end of the conflict have yet
to materialize (see Section D). However, foreign investor
interest in government paper has been strong, and official
encouragement of external borrowing by the private sector is
expected to result in strong inflows over the medium term
(see DSA supplement for a discussion of external debt
dynamics and risks).

110

Dec-07

After a strong depreciation in the first half of 2012, the real
effective exchange rate has appreciated slightly. In contrast to
the current account approach, the results of CGER-style
analysis of the equilibrium real effective exchange rate
approach point to a slight undervaluation of around
3 percent. However, these results are well within the margin of
error, and in staff’s view, the broader trends in the trade
balance confirm the current account approaches and suggest
a continued slight overvaluation.

C. Financial Sector Stability
31.
The FSAP update recognized progress in banking supervision. Risk-based
supervision guidelines have been issued, and stress testing and early warning systems refined.
Nonbank supervision has also improved, although some opportunities for regulatory arbitrage
may exist, and capacity should be strengthened. Developing more robust consolidated
supervision and macroprudential frameworks would enhance effectiveness (Box 5 summarizes
core FSAP recommendations).
32.
Recent years’ rapid credit growth justifies heightened vigilance for systemic
vulnerabilities. International experience indicates that credit booms often presage systemic risk
buildup.1 Some indicators in Sri Lanka flashed warning signals, including rapid growth in the creditto-GDP ratio and the emergence of an excess credit gap (Figure 2). Macrofinancial indicators
provide additional warning signs, but also some comfort. Early during the credit boom, the real
exchange rate appreciated and equity prices rose sharply, but both have subsequently eased. Land
prices have been subdued, and credit growth is now slowing.
33.
FSAP stress tests suggest an overall sound banking sector, but some risks warrant
close attention. Most banks are well placed to deal with severe liquidity stress, given relatively large
holdings of short-term government securities. Market risk is also broadly contained, except for one
bank exposed to re-pricing risk on its large government debt holdings. A very severe credit shock
that raises NPLs to around 23 percent, however, would leave 7 of the 12 largest banks
undercapitalized, requiring about ½ percent of GDP in fresh capital. Credit concentration risk is also
a concern for some banks, although this is mitigated by government loan guarantees. Staff
recommended the authorities develop a program of annual stress tests for systemically important
banks, raise capital buffers in those banks found to be vulnerable, and increase general and specialmention loan loss provisioning.
34.
Further enhancing frameworks for financial safety nets, pensions, and crisis
management would strengthen safeguards. Although the lender-of-last-resort facility and
deposit insurance schemes are broadly appropriate, operational arrangements could be further
clarified. A target range for deposit insurance reserves should be established, conditions under
which the insurance scheme can borrow should be clarified, and its use for emergency liquidity
assistance to nonbanks phased out. An overall strategy and robust supervisory framework for
pension funds is needed. Formalizing roles and responsibilities for crisis management and placing
them in a comprehensive framework as well as clarifying the legal priority of creditor claims would
enhance overall preparedness. Requiring systemically important banks to design and submit
recovery and resolution plans would mitigate systemic risk.

35.
The authorities acknowledged the possibility of a modest asset quality deterioration
following a period of very strong credit growth. However, they expect NPL ratios to remain low,
and are heightening monitoring and supervision. They noted that financial system stability was
shored up by prudent regulatory and supervisory frameworks, robust capital buffers, and a stateowned bank is in the process of implementing a capital improvement plan.
36.
To strengthen supervision, the authorities have updated the examination manual.
Guidelines are being issued for undertaking annual stress tests for systemic banks, and the legal
basis for consolidated supervision is expected to be in place by mid-year. However, FSAP
recommendations to strengthen crisis preparedness, and pension and macroprudential frameworks
have yet to be initiated or are at early stages.

D. Strengthening Trade and Broadening Growth
37.
During the last decade, gains in trade openness that followed the 1977 liberalization
have been largely reversed. After peaking in 2000, exports have declined significantly as a share of
GDP and of world exports, returning to the lows of the 1980s. Effective rates of protection have
increased and the government has generally emphasized import substitution. Remittances have
approximately doubled over the last five years, reflecting high growth of overseas workers, but this
has been unable to compensate fully for the poor trade performance. At the same time, FDI inflows
have been relatively subdued, and low by regional comparison, and consequently the current
account deficit has been financed mainly through debt-creating flows.

38.
Deeper integration with the world economy would support robust and broad growth.
This would help reallocate resources to productive sectors, strengthen competitiveness, and
broaden domestic employment opportunities. Achieving this will require greater export
diversification product-wise and geographically—India and China account for only 6 percent of
exports—moving to high-value, high-tech goods and services, raising export sophistication, and
attracting FDI (Figure 3).2 Reforming the trade tariff structure to reduce protectionism would
facilitate increased trade. Exchange rate flexibility will also be critical to buffer external shocks and
provide appropriate relative price signals.
39.
Productivity must also rise. This would require cutting policy barriers and red tape,
improving the business climate, and expanding infrastructure.3 As well, an educated and productive
labor force is key, pointing to the potential benefits of investment in education and health.
Developing financial markets and a framework for public private partnerships for investment would
help increase private sector involvement.
40.
The authorities concurred on the need to strengthen competitiveness. They noted that
exchange rate flexibility could only play a limited role in supporting competitiveness over the long term,
and their focus is on developing five strategic global hubs (aviation, naval, knowledge, commerce, and
energy). As well, infrastructure is being upgraded, the Board of Investment has been revamped to
encourage inward investment, and measures are being taken to improve the business climate. Negative
perceptions stemming from the time of the conflict are still a handicap, but these are being overcome.
The authorities noted the staff’s views on the need to address protectionism through tariff reform, but
observed that some measures would continue to be needed to support domestic production.

OTHER ISSUES
41.
In accordance with Fund policy, the Managing Director recommends the initiation of
Post-Program Monitoring (PPM). The last Fund arrangement expired July 2012, Fund credit
outstanding will exceed 200 percent of quota (PPM threshold) until 2015, and the external position
remains vulnerable. It is recommended that PPM be conducted on a semiannual basis until the
external position strengthens significantly, the underlying risks are adequately addressed, and the
stock of outstanding obligations to the Fund falls below the PPM threshold. In staff’s view,
Sri Lanka’s capacity to repay the Fund remains adequate, as suggested by the indicators in Table 5.
A PPM mission and Board discussion would be envisioned for the second half of 2013.

2

Export markets remain concentrated in the European Union and the United States and product diversification is
limited. Manufacturing exports dominate goods exports; the basket is comprised mainly of traditional low- and
medium-tech exports, and overall product sophistication is low. See Anand et. al. “Structural Transformation and the
Sophistication of Production,” IMF WP/12/59.

3

While surveys indicate that the ease of doing business has improved, bureaucratic procedures remain a constraint,
and trade costs are high relative to comparator countries.

STAFF APPRAISAL
42.
The Sri Lankan economy has enjoyed a broad degree of success in recent years. The
authorities’ achievements were supported by the Stand-By Arrangement successfully completed last
year. Embarking on a second generation of reforms to embed macroeconomic stability and address
deeper structural issues would set the stage for a sustained superior economic performance.
43.
The near-term macroeconomic picture is challenging. Growth slowed following bold
policy measures undertaken early last year, and reflecting weak global growth and weather shocks.
However, elevated inflation and inflation expectations risk generating a self-reinforcing cycle and
macroeconomic instability, which would undermine medium-term growth and efforts to reduce
inequality and poverty further. Under the staff’s baseline scenario, a period of moderate, belowpotential growth would help reduce inflation pressures and the current account deficit, and calls for
continued macroeconomic policy restraint.
44.
The commitment to reduce the fiscal deficit to 5.8 percent of GDP in 2013 is welcome.
Public debt remains high, and delivering the budget’s deficit reduction objective, while clearing
arrears, would send an important signal of the authorities’ commitment to debt sustainability, and
support monetary policy in containing inflation. The authorities’ aim to reduce the deficit below
5 percent of GDP over the medium term is also welcome. However, a more ambitious consolidation
path based on higher revenues than under the current baseline scenario would generate a higherquality adjustment by creating space for elevating infrastructure spending to sustain robust inclusive
growth, while reducing public debt and external vulnerabilities.
45.
Further revenue reform is vital. Tax revenues as a share of GDP have been falling almost
continuously since the mid-1980s, leaving Sri Lanka with one of the lowest revenue-to-GDP ratios in
the region. As a consequence, deficit reduction has relied on expenditure compression, although
this strategy is approaching its limits, as evidenced in 2012 when the deficit exceeded its target
despite expenditure cuts and arrears. The main challenges are to broaden the revenue base and
improve administration in a second phase of reforms. In particular, the VAT should be extended fully
to the wholesale and retail sectors, and its refund management system reformed. Equally important
is to reduce and revise tax holidays and exemptions, which have undermined revenues but failed to
enhance FDI.
46.
Placing the state-owned energy companies on a sound commercial footing and
strengthening the PFM system are important for macrofiscal sustainability. Losses at the CEB
and CPC crowd out resources for private investment and raise contingent government liabilities. The
authorities’ steps to increase energy prices are commendable, and should reduce losses in the near
term. Adopting cost-recovery pricing and subsequently implementing an automatic price
adjustment mechanism with adequate safeguards for targeted social protection would eliminate
losses, while initiatives to install cheaper electricity generation capacity take shape. PFM measures to
strengthen budget preparation, execution and reporting would improve budget control and
efficiency, and are welcome.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SRI LANKA

47.
Monetary policy should remain on hold until firm evidence emerges that inflation
pressures will decline. Staff supports the authorities’ goal of reducing inflation to mid-single digits,
important for strengthening policy credibility and macroeconomic stability. However, elevated
inflation, rising wage demands, and prospective energy-price increases tilt inflation risks to the
upside. The recent easing of monetary policy should provide some support to growth toward the
end of this year, but a further significant easing with the aim of quickly rekindling high growth
would jeopardize inflation reduction efforts.
48.
Enhancing monetary policy effectiveness and deepening markets would support
inflation control in the context of exchange rate flexibility. The authorities’ interest in moving
toward flexible inflation targeting is welcome, as it should help anchor inflation expectations, while
sustaining exchange rate flexibility is important to facilitate external adjustment and buffer shocks.
Complementary reforms to deepen the foreign exchange market and improve monetary operations
would reduce interest and exchange rate volatility and strengthen the transmission mechanism.
Intervention should be limited to countering excessive volatility and opportunistic accumulation of
reserves, which appear low by a number of metrics. Staff recommends against providing
government guarantees for foreign-currency borrowing by banks.
49.
Reinforcing financial system soundness is critical for macrofinancial stability,
increasing access to finance, and broadening growth. The authorities have made good progress
in strengthening bank supervision and the banking system appears sound. Credit risks require
close monitoring and NPLs may increase if recent years’ rapid credit expansion masked an
underlying deterioration in loan quality. The authorities’ plans to enhance supervision and raise
capital in a state-owned bank are welcome. Improvements to financial safety nets, more robust
provisioning, and developing frameworks for pension supervision and crisis management would
further safeguard stability.
50.
Expanding trade and broadening the sources of growth would play a key role in
achieving the authorities’ development objectives and strengthening the external position. A
stronger and more consistent business climate, a simplified trade regime, and increased investment
in infrastructure and human capital should result in higher FDI and a diversification of the export
base, buttressing Sri Lanka’s external position and reducing reliance on debt-creating financing
flows. Such improvements would also enhance the scope for private sector participation and
broaden growth opportunities.
51.
It is recommended that PPM takes place on a semiannual basis, and the next Article IV
Consultation takes place on the standard 12-month cycle.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION AND PROPOSAL FOR
POST-PROGRAM MONITORING—DEBT
SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

April 12, 2013

Approved By
Hoe Ee Khor and
Dhaneshwar Ghura

Prepared by the Staff Representatives of the 2013
Consultation with Sri Lanka

Sri Lanka’s public and external debt burden, while still relatively elevated, remains on a
sustainable trajectory under the baseline assumptions. Continued revenue weaknesses present
the main downside risk to public debt sustainability, while the increasing recourse to
nonconcessional external borrowing, including by the private sector, point to the need for
enhanced monitoring of the external debt burden and maturities to limit rollover risk.

Macroeconomic Assumptions
Growth is projected at 6¼ percent in 2013, reflecting tepid external demand, a moderately
contractionary budget, and the lagged impact of tight monetary policy. From 2015 onward
growth is projected at 6½ percent, slightly higher than its 10-year average reflecting capital
deepening and improved factor productivity.
Inflation is expected to come down from the high to the mid-single digits over the medium
term, as the government moves toward a strategy of flexible inflation targeting.
Fiscal assumptions: The 2013 fiscal deficit is assumed to be 5.8 percent, in line with the
authorities’ target. Despite revenue shortfalls, deficit targets are assumed to be met by
constraining spending. Fiscal consolidation is projected to continue in the medium term: the
deficit is projected to fall to 5 percent of GDP in 2015, and to 4¾ percent in 2017.


Revenues. Tax revenues are projected to increase only moderately over the medium term,
by slightly over 1 percent of GDP, while nontax revenues are assumed to grow broadly in
line with nominal GDP. The increase in tax revenue is driven mainly by higher VAT
collection, reflecting gradual base broadening and better administration.



Expenditure. Continued expenditure restraint is assumed to help achieve deficit reduction.
Current expenditures are projected to fall further moderately, by about ¼ percent of GDP,

SRI LANKA

reflecting both lower interest payments and lower growth in security spending and
subsidies. Capital spending as a share of GDP—already weak—is assumed to remain flat.


Financing. Net external financing of the budget is projected to be below 2 percent of GDP,
below the historical average. The government’s reliance on external commercial financing is
expected to decline, reflecting the authorities’ policy of borrowing from domestic sources,
which are expected to account for the balance of the government’s financing needs.

External assumptions: While the trade deficit is expected to remain relatively elevated at
around 14 percent of GDP, the current account is expected to continue consolidating from its
peak in 2011 as a result of strong growth in receipts from tourism (reflecting the post-conflict
increase in hotel capacity) and remittances (reflecting the increase in emigration, particularly of
skilled labor). FDI is expected to increase gradually to around 2 percent of GDP, partly resulting
from projects already in the pipeline, as well as additional efforts expected in the context of
Sri Lanka’s five-hub strategy. As a result of partial financial account liberalization as well as
explicit incentives to encourage foreign borrowing by the banking sector, long-term flows to
the private sector are expected to be significant over the medium term. Foreign inflows into
the domestic bond market and equity markets are also expected to remain relatively robust,
though with the former remaining subject to a prudential cap on foreign participation.

Public Debt Sustainability
Baseline: Under the baseline scenario, the ratio of public debt-to-GDP is projected to decline
gradually to close to 70 percent by 2017, from around 80 percent in 2012. In 2016 and 2017,
the primary balance is projected to move to close to zero. The bulk of the reduction in the
debt ratio comes from a favorable interest rate-growth differential.
Other scenarios: A 30 percent real depreciation would push the debt ratio to close to
100 percent of GDP, reflecting a relatively high share of debt in foreign currency, while a
contingent liability shock would raise the ratio to around 90 percent of GDP. A no policy
change scenario, under which the primary balance does not improve as in the baseline,
generates a somewhat slower reduction in debt ratio. However, this scenario, and growthshock and interest-rate-shock scenarios, still shows a declining debt ratio—though at slower
pace and staying well above 70 percent of GDP.
Risks: The projected gradual decline in the public debt ratio is based on two key assumptions:
(i) continued deficit reduction; and (ii) continued favorable interest rate-growth differential.
Should deficit reduction fail, or growth turn out to be slower or interest rates higher than
projected, the decline in the debt ratio could be slowed or even reversed. This could happen if
envisaged improvements in tax revenues fail to materialize, and/or continued spending
restraint becomes difficult to sustain. Contingent liabilities also pose a risk. Current explicit
guarantees are not large, less than 4 percent of GDP, but there is a risk of increased external
borrowing by banks that could eventually entail fiscal risk to the government. As illustrated in
2012, the debt ratio is also sensitive to currency movements. On the other hand, implementing
a comprehensive tax policy and administration reform could significantly increase revenue, and
allow for deficit reduction with higher public infrastructure investment and thus higher growth.

External Debt Sustainability
Structure of debt: With relatively tight capital controls in place, the large majority of Sri Lanka’s
external debt burden is currently owed by the government and, to a lesser extent, the broader
public sector. Rollover risks are limited over the medium term, with around half of the
government’s foreign debt stock contracted on concessional terms and long amortization
schedules. Outstanding Eurobonds total US$3.5 billion, with US$500 million maturing in 2015
and US$1 billion per year in 2020 and the following three years. With the authorities
encouraging more external borrowing by the financial sector, the share of private external debt
is expected to increase over the medium term.
Baseline: As of end-2012, the external debt-to-GDP ratio is estimated at around 57 percent, up
from 50 percent at the end of 2011, with much of the increase reflecting exchange rate
depreciation. Under the baseline scenario, the debt ratio is expected to fall gradually over the
medium term, supported by robust growth and the relatively low effective interest rate on
Sri Lanka’s external debt, reaching 51 percent of GDP by 2017.
Other scenarios: A one-time real depreciation of 30 percent in 2013 would see the debt-toGDP ratio increase to around 80 percent before declining gradually thereafter. A permanent
one-half standard deviation shock to the growth rate would still see the debt-to-GDP ratio on a
declining trend, with the debt ratio at around 53 percent of GDP at the end of the projection
period. A failure of the current account to consolidate over the medium term would have a
greater impact on the debt burden: a noninterest deficit in the range of 4.5 percent of GDP
would result in the debt-to-GDP ratio increasing slightly over the projection period.
Risks: The envisaged consolidation of the current account is premised on exchange rate flexibility.
Failure to allow the exchange rate to move in line with fundamentals could lead to the current
account deficit remaining at elevated levels, supported by higher external borrowing. Weakerthan-expected global growth could pose downside risks to tourism and revenue receipts. On the
upside, stronger FDI (as projected by the authorities) could enhance the country’s productive
capacity and lead to faster growth in tourism and the export sector than in the baseline.
While the policy of encouraging the financial sector to borrow abroad directly may serve to reduce
the central government’s external debt burden, it does not reduce the risks for the economy as a
whole. The external debt burden and external debt service profile should be monitored carefully to
ensure that external reserves are sufficient, rollover risks limited, and the overall debt burden
remains on an appropriate trajectory in line with the country’s debt servicing capacity.

Authorities’ Views
The authorities agreed with the broad thrust of the debt sustainability analysis. They noted that
the government had played a major role in intermediating funds for development in the past,
and public debt was higher than other countries as a result. Fiscal consolidation would support
a decline in the government’s debt burden. Increased foreign borrowing by commercial banks
would allow for financing of state-owned enterprises’ capital spending off budget, though
guarantees for such borrowing would be necessary at the early stages of the strategy.

Exchange Rate Arrangement
The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating since its introduction by the Central Bank of
Sri Lanka (CBSL) on January 23, 2001. The CBSL intervenes in the foreign exchange market to limit
volatility in the exchange rate. After a period of following a stable path, the authorities have limited
their interventions in the foreign exchange market and allowed for increased flexibility against the
U.S. dollar since February 2012. As a result, the rupee–U.S. dollar exchange rate departed from the
stabilized band and moved more freely. Accordingly, effective February 9, 2012, the de facto
exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to floating from a stabilized arrangement.
Sri Lanka maintains an exchange system free of exchange restrictions on the making of payments
and transfers for current international transactions, except for the exchange restrictions imposed by
Sri Lanka solely for the preservation of national or international security.
Safeguards Assessment
Under the Fund's safeguards assessment policy, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) was subject to
an update safeguards assessment with respect to a Stand-By Arrangement approved in July 2009.
The assessment, completed in July 2009, found that the CBSL continues to have a relatively strong
safeguards framework, especially in the external audit, financial reporting and control areas. The
assessment recommended measures to improve the process of program data reporting to the Fund
and to modernize and strengthen the internal audit function. Also the external audit arrangements
were not fully institutionalized. The authorities have already implemented majority
recommendations of the report.
Article IV Consultation
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation take place in 12 months.
FSAP and ROSC Participation
 FAD: A fiscal transparency ROSC was completed and the report published in 2002. A ROSC update
was completed and the report published in July 2005.
 MCM: An FSAP update took place in July 2012.
 MFD: Both the FSSA and the FSAP reports were completed in 2002.
 STA: A data ROSC was completed and the report published in 2002.
Technical Assistance
 FAD: In June 2001, a TA mission in tax policy and administration took place. A series of TA
missions in revenue administration were conducted in 2003. In September 2012, a mission
visited Sri Lanka to evaluate the state of the Inland Revenue Department with a particular focus
on the effectiveness of the administration of the Value Added Tax (VAT) and secondarily the
Nation Building Tax to identify measures to staunch and reverse the decline in VAT collections
and improve the overall performance of the VAT system and taxpayer compliance. In November
2012, a mission conducted a diagnostic review of the Public Financial Management Reforms.

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
(As of March 18, 2013)

The Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY13–16 is designed to assist the government of
Sri Lanka (GoSL) to address the long-term strategic and structural development challenges, while
using the existing portfolio to support ongoing efforts to restore livelihoods of internally displaced
persons and others affected by the conflict.
The FY13–16 CPS provides support to address the challenges for achieving the government’s
vision as laid out in the “Mahinda Chintana—Vision for the Future.” For each of the three
central goals of the government’s vision, the CPS lays out the key areas of engagement in which
World Bank Group support can most effectively address the identified challenges. These areas of
engagement were developed through a process of 18 thematic consultations with the GoSL, private
sector, civil society, development partners, and other stakeholders.
The first goal of the Mahinda Chintana—to increase per capita income to US$4,000 by 2016—
will require sustained high economic growth (8 percent per year), driven by a high investment rate.
The World Bank Group will support government efforts to improve the investment climate,
strengthen governance, and reduce the inefficiencies of the public sector. The IFC plans to catalyze
private investment through directly investing in important projects in key sectors. The World Bank
will support the government’s efforts to maintain a high level of public investment and improved
efficiency of public expenditures, and financial management and procurement practices in line with
international standards, using both knowledge (e.g., Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability
Assessment and Public Expenditure Review) and lending products (e.g., a development policy loan
for investment policy and governance reforms and an investment loan for legal and judicial
reforms.) The World Bank will also advise government on ways to improve the efficiency of
state-owned enterprises.
The second goal is shifting toward a more knowledge-based, globally integrated and
competitive, environmentally friendly, internally integrated, and increasingly urban economy.
The World Bank Group will deepen its assistance to the knowledge-based economy with
investments in skills, research, and innovation. In addition, support for the development of
infrastructure projects needed for sustainable urban development and better linkages within
Sri Lanka will be enhanced. The Bank Group also stands ready to support government efforts to
promote environmental sustainability and climate change adaptation.
The third goal is ensuring improvement in living standards and social inclusion. The World
Bank Group will continue to support improvements in living standards and social inclusion in order
to ensure that the benefits of rapid growth and higher quality services are broadly shared. Activities
in this area already include three ongoing livelihood projects in the conflict-affected North and East
regions of the country addressing restoration of basic infrastructures, housing construction, and
cash for work, as well as support for starting new businesses. During the CPS period, the program

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SRI LANKA

will further include: (i) support to the national health sector program with a focus on supporting
emerging service delivery demands resulting from Sri Lanka’s aging population, such as work on
noncommunicable diseases; (ii) inter-sectoral efforts to address malnutrition, economic integration
of women, and a range of other activities to further support the needs of women, youth, and the
disabled; (iii) analytical work on allocation of resources and benefits received by various groups; and
(iv) IFC’s support for inclusive growth.
Sri Lanka is an IDA-IBRD blend country as of FY12. An indicative lending program for IDA and
IBRD combined for the first two years of the CPS is US$300 million in FY13 and US$727 million in
FY14. Sri Lanka’s eligibility for IDA will likely end with the IDA 16 cycle. The government is interested
in IBRD lending of up to $500 million annually during FY15 and FY16, which would, however, depend
on the macroeconomic environment in Sri Lanka, overall demand for IBRD resources from other
clients, IBRD financial capacity and global economic developments.

RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of March 18, 2013)

Asian Development Bank (ADB) Country Strategy for Sri Lanka


Country partnership strategy
ADB’s Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Sri Lanka, approved in 2011, identifies three pillars:
(i) inclusive and sustainable economic growth; (ii) catalyzing private investment; and
(iii) enhancing the effectiveness of public investment and human resource and knowledge
development as the focus of operations over the period 2012–16. ADB provides extensive
support to infrastructure development, especially in transport, energy, urban, and water supply
sectors. Recognizing the magnitude of the needs in the former conflict areas, ADB remains
flexible to support critical interventions in these regions depending on the emerging needs.



Indicative resources
The annual allocation for 2013–14 consists of $200 million from ordinary capital resources (OCR)
and $130.87 million from the Asian Development Fund (ADF).



Country program
- As indicated in Country Operations Business Plan (COBP) for the period 2013–15, the country’s
proposed program addresses the priority agendas of middle-income countries, such as skills
development, transport network optimization, and sustainable energy. In the finance sector,
projects will be identified to support private sector development, for example, in infrastructure
financing. To ensure critical mass and continuity, the COBP will take an investment program
approach, and financing modalities will include multi-tranche financing facility (MFF), resultsbased programs, and additional project financing. To the extent possible, thematic priorities
such as gender, governance, climate change, and regional cooperation will be included in
each project. Cofinancing and private sector operation opportunities will be explored to
achieve the target of $2 billion support over a four-year period.
- The country program focuses on reducing nonrevenue water (NRW) and improving wastewater
management in the greater Colombo area. The Greater Colombo Water and Wastewater
Management Improvement Investment Program (MFF) targets a reduction of NRW in Colombo
City from 60 percent to about 18 percent in critical areas, and to about 20 percent elsewhere
after project completion. The MFF will be a platform to mobilize cofinancing and to introduce
public–private partnerships (PPPs). The first two tranches focus on water supply, while the third
and fourth tranches primarily address wastewater management.
- The program addresses the issues of high power generation cost and sustainability in four
areas: (i) diversifying energy sources by increasing the share of renewable energy, including
wind, hydro, and solar; (ii) strengthening transmission infrastructure to absorb additional
capacity from renewable energy sources, and expanding access in post-conflict areas and
lagging regions; (iii) improving network efficiency through technical loss reduction; and
(iv) enhancing regional cooperation. The first tranche under the Green Power Development
and Energy Efficiency Improvement Investment Program (MFF) is programmed for 2014.

-

A technical assistance (TA) loan to prepare the detailed engineering design for the India–
Sri Lanka Power Interconnection Project is programmed for 2015, with a loan project
expected in 2016–17.
The country program supports the planning, preparation, rehabilitation, and upgrading of
national highways and provincial roads. The National Highways Investment Program (MFF) is
expected to be processed in 2014 to optimize the connectivity of highways and expressways
currently under development.
The country program also strengthens education and develops skills relevant to Sri Lanka’s
growth by supporting priority sectors linked to the knowledge economy. To provide long-term
financing under a sector-wide approach, the “Human Capital Development: Education Sector
Development Program” will cover technical secondary education. Tranches for secondary
education will prepare students for higher education to cater to the needs of the labor
market. The education sector has a medium-term expenditure framework and sector plan,
and the shift toward results-based financing will support government reform and
implementation efforts. A tranche to strengthen innovation and research will support
second-generation education reforms. The “Human Capital Development: TVET Sector
Development Program,” programmed for 2014, will cover vocational education and training
(TVET), innovation support. Tranches for TVET will improve access, quality, and relevance of
vocational education and training to address the skills needs of employers in nine priority
industry sectors.
The nonlending pipeline is restructured to meet the requirements of the lending pipeline.
Project preparatory TA will formulate the scope of proposed MFFs and their initial tranches,
while the preparation of subsequent tranches will be financed under the MFFs. Capacity
development TA will support project implementation to ensure effective project outcome
and impact.
In the absence of a PPP framework, ADB will adopt a project-based approach. Performancebased contracts can be structured as part of regular sovereign projects, such as the Greater
Colombo Water and Wastewater Management Improvement Investment Program. ADB’s
Private Sector Operations Department will support finance sector development by providing
loans, equity investments, or guarantees for banks or nonbank institutions to enable them to
expand activities in targeted areas including housing, small- and medium-sized enterprise
finance, leasing, renewable energy, and infrastructure lending. ADB may also provide
transaction advisory services to structure and procure developers for PPP projects as needed.

Portfolio performance
- Sri Lanka has received $5.6 billion for 164 public sector loans and $120.6 million for 256 TA
projects since joining the ADB in 1966. As of December 31, 2012, there were 40 ongoing public
sector loans and 11 grants for a total loan amount of $2.4 billion. Of the 40 loans, 14 loans were
financed from OCR, 25 from the ADF, and one cofinance loan from OFID.
- The ongoing portfolio primarily is for Transport, Urban & Water and Energy Sector and
contributes to about 84 percent of the loan amount. ADB has been supporting the
government’s efforts in post-conflict reconstruction. The sector composition of the ongoing
loan portfolio is in Figure 1.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. Most affected areas
are national accounts and government finance statistics.
National accounts. The national accounts suffer from insufficient data sources and undeveloped
statistical techniques. The country does not have periodic comprehensive benchmarks or a system
of regular annual surveys of establishments. A statistical business register, which would serve as the
main basis for conducting sample surveys, is not available. As a result, the few surveys that are
conducted do not have good sample frames. Most of the data used are obtained on a timely basis.
However, detailed data needed to measure both output and intermediate consumption are mostly
unavailable or not collected. As a result, the estimates of gross value added are prepared directly
relying on outdated fixed ratios established from the base year 1996, often with outdated studies or
ad hoc assumptions. Quarterly indicators are used for compiling quarterly value-added estimates.
The methodology for deriving GDP at constant prices is not satisfactory. Expenditure estimates are
available only annually and rely mostly on commodity flow techniques. Whenever possible,
estimates are validated and checked with other sources.
Price statistics. The Department of Census and Statistics (DCS) collects consumer prices for all of
Sri Lanka, but no national index is computed. The DCS compiles the official consumer price index
(CPI)—the Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI). This is compiled monthly; it covers households of
all income groups, but is restricted to Colombo and its suburbs. The February 2013 STA mission
discussed and demonstrated how to develop a weighting scheme to support the aggregation of
prices collected from the 25 districts into regional indices and an “All Sri Lanka” index. Effective with
the new CPI, index coverage will be expanded to include all households in the country. The mission
also discussed recommendations to improve index calculation methods and the treatment of
missing prices. The authorities welcomed the efforts to update and improve the CPI.
Government finance statistics. In May 2003, a STA mission followed up on the ROSC
recommendation to develop a migration path to compile data in accordance with the Government
Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001). As part of that plan, the authorities agreed to revise
(beginning in end-2003) the budgetary classifications and the accounting structure to eventually
match the GFSM 2001 classifications of stocks and flows and to apply that chart of accounts to all
general government units.
Further technical assistance in 2013, under the Japan Subaccount (JSA) Project, found that areas for
improvement in the Sri Lankan fiscal and GFS systems were: (i) upgrading the authorities capacity for
compiling GFS through TA and training programs; (ii) establishing sub-annual high frequency
reporting of GFS for International Financial Statistics (IFS) ; (iii) expanding coverage of GFS to
provincial and local governments; (iv) the compilation of financing and debt data in line with GFS
balance sheet format; (v) sectorization of the public sector needs to be updated to ensure complete
coverage of GFS and facilitate consolidation of general government GFS for high frequency reporting;
and (vi) a review of the GFS mapping of the chart of accounts is needed to augment a number of

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SRI LANKA

steps that have been initiated by the Ministry of Finance and Planning to upgrade government
accounting and reporting standards. These issues are to be addressed in a follow up mission in 2013
with additional missions in 2014 and 2015.
Monetary statistics. Foreign Currency Banking Units (FCBUs) are classified as resident institutions in
the monetary survey since 1998. To adjust for the proportion of nonresident foreign currency
deposits, which are actually held by residents (mainly returning migrant workers), 50 percent of these
deposits are reclassified from foreign liabilities to domestic deposits.
In June 2003, a STA mission followed up on issues raised during the 2001 ROSC mission. In particular,
the mission clarified the methodology for the treatment of Fund accounts; recommended that repos
be treated as collateralized loans (rather than on a change of ownership basis); and resolved
discrepancies between the monetary authorities data reported to STA and to APD, which reflected
problems in the valuation of Fund accounts and other shortcomings.
Balance of payments. The CBSL publishes balance of payments statistics on a quarterly and annual
basis. Quarterly data are available three months after the end of the quarter. The data largely follow
the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual.
The STA mission (December 2004) focused on shortcomings in the international transactions
reporting system (ITRS)—the primary data source for the balance of payments. The mission
recommended resolution of large values of unclassified transactions, inclusion of FCBUs in the data,
and circulation of an instruction book to assist ITRS reporters to apply classifications and coding more
accurately. The mission advised the authorities on the need to develop comprehensive surveys to
implement their medium-term plan to introduce international investment position statistics. Currently,
the FCBUs are included in the data, and work on compilation of international investment position
has commenced.
Sri Lanka has been a participant in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) since July 2000. In
February 2003, the authorities appointed a coordinator with the objective of subscribing to the Special
Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS). Work is in progress toward meeting all SDDS requirements.
A data ROSC mission visited Sri Lanka in 2001. Most of its recommendations have been implemented,
while others are expected to be implemented in the near future.
The authorities report key data to the Fund on a timely basis. On government finance, annual cash
data were regularly reported for publication in the GFS Yearbook. These data cover only the
budgetary accounts of central government; and no data on the extrabudgetary funds or the
provincial and local governments are reported. At the same time, no sub-annual data are reported
for publication in IFS. The authorities have been encouraged to reduce the time lag for data
reporting. The authorities have not yet begun reporting data in the format of Standardized Report
Forms, which were developed by STA for reporting monetary data and reflect principles for
classifying positions by economic sector, financial instrument, and currency of denomination
recommended in the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
May 9, 2013

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation and
Supports Proposal for Post-Program Monitoring with Sri Lanka
On May 1, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Sri Lanka.1
Background
Sri Lanka has achieved notable progress on a number of economic fronts in recent years,
although there have also been challenges. While slowing recently, growth has been generally
robust, fiscal consolidation has taken place, and poverty and inequality have declined. Other
aspects of Sri Lanka’s development agenda, however, require continuing effort. The authorities
are keen to broaden and deepen economic development, building on the achievements of the
recently completed Stand-By Arrangement with the Fund. Safeguarding macroeconomic
stability and launching a new phase of structural reforms would facilitate ambitious mediumterm development goals.
Real growth slowed to 6.4 percent in 2012 as macroeconomic policies were tightened,
spillovers from weak global growth undermined exports, and drought and subsequent floods
adversely affected agriculture. Headline inflation hovered near double digits for most of the year
following an upward shift due to exchange rate depreciation and higher food and administered
prices, before easing in early 2013 due in large part to base effects. Core inflation trended
upward, and inflation expectations and private sector wage demands rose. The current account
deficit declined to around 6½ percent of GDP.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2

The government’s 2012 budget deficit is estimated to have fallen to about 6½ percent of GDP,
above the budget’s 6¼ percent target, due to expenditure restraint and payment arrears, while
revenues were significantly lower than budgeted. The 2013 budget targets a 5.8 percent of GDP
deficit. Losses at the state-owned energy companies rose to around 2 percent of GDP in 2012
despite significant domestic energy price increases, as drought induced a shift in electricity
generation away from inexpensive hydroelectric to expensive thermal sources.
With inflation elevated and growth slowing, monetary policy is facing a challenging task. Policy
was eased recently, but further stimulus should be on hold until inflation pressures decline.
Financial soundness indicators are robust, and progress has been made in strengthening
banking supervision, however rapid credit expansion in recent years justifies heightened
vigilance for vulnerabilities.
Growth is projected at around 6¼ percent in 2013. A moderately contractionary budget and the
lagged impact of tight monetary conditions and real wage compression should restrain domestic
demand, while external demand is projected to remain tepid. Inflation pressures should
moderate through the year, although headline inflation would be affected if domestic energy
prices are increased further, and the current account deficit should narrow further. Near-term
risks to the outlook are on the downside, and include revenue weakness, a weaker-thananticipated global environment, and continued inflation pressures.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for prudent policy implementation, which,
supported by the Stand-By Arrangement concluded last year, has facilitated the achievement of
robust growth and poverty reduction in a difficult environment. The near-term outlook presents
challenges, including slower growth and elevated inflation. Directors emphasized that a new phase
of reforms is needed to ensure a sustainable fiscal position, achieve low and stable inflation,
safeguard financial stability, and support high and inclusive growth over the medium term.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ continued efforts toward fiscal consolidation, particularly on
recurrent spending, given a high public debt ratio, and supported the goal of reducing the
budget deficit while clearing expenditure arrears. However, they noted that revenues have fallen
to very low levels, placing the burden of adjustment on expenditure, notably capital spending.
To enhance space for infrastructure and critical social spending, Directors stressed the need to
broaden the revenue base and improve tax administration, including by extending the VAT fully
to the retail and wholesale sectors, reforming the refund system, and revising tax holidays and
exemptions. Directors further underscored the need to put state-owned energy enterprises on a
sound financial footing. They noted that the recent electricity price hike should help reduce
losses, and advised adopting an automatic price adjustment mechanism, complemented by
targeted social protection safeguards. Recent efforts to strengthen public financial management
will support the overall fiscal consolidation strategy.
With rising wage and cost pressures, Directors cautioned against a further easing of monetary
policy in the near term. Exchange rate flexibility should be maintained to cushion external

3
shocks, while deeper markets and a gradual move toward a flexible inflation targeting regime
would strengthen inflation control. Directors noted that international reserves are relatively low
by most metrics, and encouraged strengthening the reserve position as circumstances permit.
They cautioned that government guarantees for foreign currency borrowing by banks, if
introduced, could undermine exchange rate flexibility, create contingent liabilities, and raise debt
sustainability risks.
Directors concurred that the banking system appears sound and welcomed the progress in
strengthening financial sector supervision and regulation. They called for vigilance following
recent high credit growth and encouraged the authorities to draw on the recommendations of
the updated Financial Stability Assessment Program to bolster financial stability further.
Directors noted the long-term deterioration of the export-to-GDP ratio and growing reliance on
debt for current account deficit financing. They encouraged the authorities to boost
competitiveness, including through strengthening trade, expanding infrastructure, and further
improvements in the business climate to attract foreign direct investment. Directors supported
the proposal for post-program monitoring.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on Sri Lanka
April 26, 2013
This statement contains information that has become available since the staff report was
circulated to the Executive Board. This information does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
1.
The Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka kept policy rates
unchanged at its April 12 meeting. The policy rate corridor remains at 7½–9½ percent.
Growth of broad money and credit to the private sector continued to moderate to 17 percent and
13¼ percent year-on-year, respectively, in February.
2.
The Bank of Ceylon, a state-owned bank, issued a US$500 million five-year bond
with a 5.325 percent coupon. The issue was six times oversubscribed and upsized from an
initially planned offer of US$300 million. There were no government guarantees. Fitch rated the
issue at BB-. The yield was substantially lower than a similar bond issued a year ago at
6.875 percent.
3.
The Public Utilities Commission approved a new electricity tariff structure with
effect from April 20. Electricity costs increased on average by around 35 percent and the tariff
calculation methodology was revised. The cost structure remains progressive, although the
effective increase was greater for small consumers than for large consumers. The increase is
estimated to contribute to reducing the combined losses of the state-owned energy companies
by around one percentage point of GDP in 2013. The first-round impact on the consumer price
index is estimated at around 1¾ percentage points.

Statement by Rakesh Mohan, Executive Director and K.D. Ranasinghe, Alternate
Executive Director for Sri Lanka
April 26, 2013
1.
Our Sri Lankan authorities are appreciative of the constructive discussions they
had in Colombo with the staff mission and of the resulting comprehensive assessment of
the economy and reports produced. They would like to thank the Management, Executive
Board and staff for the continued productive engagement with Sri Lanka.
2.
Despite deepening global uncertainties, a significant economic transformation is
taking place in Sri Lanka, benefiting from post-conflict optimism, political stability,
infrastructure development and implementation of reforms. These developments have
benefitted from the support provided by the IMF-SBA, which was successfully
concluded in July 2012.
Recent Economic Developments
3.
The Sri Lankan economy grew at a commendable rate of 6.4 percent in 2012,
following over 8 percent growth in the preceding two years. This moderation of growth
in 2012 was largely attributable to subdued external demand, tightened domestic policies
and the adverse weather conditions that impacted on agricultural production and
hydropower generation. The severe drought in the second and third quarters of 2012
limited agriculture sector growth to 5.8 percent, while services sector growth moderated
to 4.6 percent, mainly due to lower domestic and external demand. The industry sector
performed well in 2012 largely supported by the thriving construction sector.
4.
The government’s development strategy focuses mainly on the development of
5 thrust areas namely, maritime, energy, aviation, knowledge and commercial sectors, in
addition to the tourism sector. Significant expansion of productive capacity has been
enabled by massive development of infrastructure, accompanied by increased savings and
investment. Major infrastructure development projects, which have already been
completed or nearing completion include 3 new sea ports, several fishery harbors, a new
international airport, power plants, new roads and irrigation schemes. With the
enhancement of domestic demand, along with the expected improvement in external
demand, our authorities are confident that the economy would return to the high growth
trajectory of 7.5 – 8.0 percent in the medium term. In terms of the World Bank’s Doing
Business Survey 2013, Sri Lanka has ranked at 81, showing a significant improvement
from 89 in the previous year. The gross investment /GDP ratio exceeded 30 percent in
2012, after remaining below 30 percent levels for the last 3 decades. Reflecting the
greater emphasis placed on regional development and inclusive growth, the disparity
between the provinces is gradually narrowing. As a result the overall poverty level has
declined from 15.2 percent in 2006/07 to 8.9 percent in 2010, with a rapid decline in rural
poverty. With continued economic expansion, the unemployment rate declined further to
4.0 per cent in 2012.

Fiscal Policy
5.
As highlighted by the staff report, fiscal consolidation remains challenging,
mainly due to some underperformance of revenue, although significant progress has been
made in recent years. Our authorities’ steadfast efforts towards fiscal consolidation
resulted in containing the fiscal deficit to 6.4 percent of GDP in 2012, falling from 9.9
percent in 2009 and 6.9 percent in 2011, but slightly higher than the targeted 6.2 percent
for 2012. Comprehensive tax reforms were introduced in 2010 and 2011 to simplify the
tax structure and broad base the tax system, under which corporate income tax was
brought down from 35 percent to 28 percent; the VAT rate was unified at 12 percent; and
certain other taxes were abolished. This reform is, however, yet to generate the desired
outcome of enhanced revenues. To some extent, the drop in revenue was offset by the
containment of recurrent expenditure, which declined from 18.2 percent in 2009 to 14.4
percent of GDP in 2012. This mainly reflected savings on account of salaries and wages,
interest payments, and transfers and subsidies. The government was able to maintain
public investment above 6 percent of GDP in recent years, although it declined to below
6 percent in 2012, mainly due to time slicing of capital expenditure in the face of
reduction in revenue. Going forward, our authorities have targeted to reduce the fiscal
deficit to 5.8 percent of GDP in 2013 and below 5 percent by 2016. Revenue is projected
to increase to 15.3 percent of GDP by 2016.
6.
Recent tax reforms were mainly focused on creating an enabling environment for
investment. Tax incentives were realigned under the Inland Revenue Act and Strategic
Investment Law to expedite the approval process and to rationalize tax incentives. Our
authorities are aware of the vital need for further broadening the tax base. Steps have
already been taken to bringing the wholesale and retail sectors under the VAT system.
The government has placed greater emphasis on improving the tax administration to
improve compliance and revenue collection. A Tax Appeals Commission and a Tax
Interpretation Committee have been set up recently. Paying taxes on a self-assessment
basis and making tax payments online have also been introduced with a view to promote
tax compliance and timely filing of tax returns.
7.
The government debt to GDP ratio, which has consistently declined from
105.6 percent in 2002, increased slightly from 78.5 percent in 2011 to 79.1 percent in
2012, largely reflecting the impact of rupee depreciation. With continued fiscal
consolidation, our authorities have projected that the debt to GDP ratio would come down
to around 65 percent by 2016.
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
8.
Inflation has been maintained at single digit levels continuously since 2009,
despite adverse domestic and external supply side shocks. The year-on-year headline
inflation recorded at 2.7 percent in February 2012 increased to 9.2 percent by end 2012,
mainly reflecting the upward adjustments in energy prices, supply disruptions due to
adverse weather conditions, the pass-through of the rupee depreciation, as well as
demand pressures. Inflation has moderated somewhat to 7.5 percent in March 2013 and

further deceleration is expected in coming months. The Central Bank’s “Road Map:
Monetary and Financial Sector Policies for 2013 and Beyond” assures the commitment of
the authorities to maintain inflation, particularly core inflation, at mid single digit levels.
9.
In response to tight policy measures adopted at the beginning of the year, credit
growth decelerated rapidly to 17.6 percent by end 2012 from 34.5 percent in the previous
year. Reserve money and money supply growth also decelerated to 10.2 percent and
17.6 percent, respectively, in 2012. These developments provided space for the Central
Bank to ease monetary policy by reducing policy rates by 25 bps in December 2012. The
benign inflationary outlook and existing output gap, if continued, would provide further
space to ease the monetary policy.
10.
Our authorities have been taking necessary steps to move towards a flexible
inflation targeting framework in the medium term. Even under the current monetary
targeting framework, inflation is implicitly targeted, and the Central Bank’s desire to
maintain inflation at mid-single digit level is well communicated to the public. Our
authorities have already taken the required steps to lengthen the current one week reserve
maintenance period to two weeks commencing June 2013, thereby allowing greater
flexibility for banks in managing their day-to-day liquidity. At the same time, among
other measures, the Central Bank commenced conducting regular term auctions to
address structural liquidity.
11.
Greater flexibility has been allowed in the exchange rate since early February
2012, by limiting the Central Bank’s intervention in the domestic foreign exchange
market. The intervention of the Central Bank during 2012 was limited only to the extent
needed to settle a portion of petroleum import bills, mainly during the first few months of
the year, while surplus foreign exchange liquidity in the market was absorbed as and
when appropriate. The rupee depreciated vis-á-vis the US dollar by 10.4 per cent during
2012. Building on successful completion of the SBA, external buffers were further
strengthened in 2012. External reserves increased to US dollars 6.9 billion by end 2012
from US dollars 6 billion at end 2011. In terms of months of imports, gross official
reserves were equivalent to 4.3 months by end 2012, a significant improvement from
3.5 months at end 2011.The limits on net open positions (NOP) and forward transactions
of commercial banks were relaxed in January 2013. It has been noted that even at the
current limits, the utilized amount of NOP is much lower, suggesting that the NOP limit
does not constrain forex market activity.
Financial System Stability
12.
Despite challenging global and domestic market conditions, overall soundness of
the financial sector improved with higher levels of capital, adequate liquidity buffers, and
healthy earnings. This has been enabled by enhanced supervisory and regulatory
frameworks and integrated risk management arrangements. Further, public confidence in
the financial system improved with financial safety net mechanisms, including mandatory
deposit insurance and consumer protection measures in place. Obligations of customers and
banks were published in the form of a customer charter. The access to finance increased

with the extension of branch networks, in particular in the regional areas. Continuous close
supervision and timely guidance helped sustaining the credit quality amidst sharp credit
growth. Given the current NPL ratio of 4.2 percent, the stress test scenario in the FSAP
report, showing an increase of industry-wide NPL ratio to 23 percent, is a highly
improbable extreme event and may lead to erroneous interpretation.
13.
The recent FSAP report contains some recommendations, which had already been
identified by our authorities for implementation. Our authorities are taking steps to
implement such recommendations at an appropriate pace. Steps have been taken to
harmonize the regulatory framework of non-banks with banks and several regulations
have already been issued in this regard. The Insurance Board of Sri Lanka (IBSL) has
already commenced two projects with TA from the World Bank to improve insurance
sector supervision, which is scheduled to be commenced in the 2nd quarter of 2013. A
draft bill for a supervisory framework for pension funds has been drafted. Our authorities
have, however, clearly indicated that certain other impractical recommendations in the
FSAP report will not be implemented.
Structural Reforms
14.
Our authorities recognize the urgent need of addressing financial difficulties of
key state owned enterprises, mainly Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) and Ceylon
Electricity Board (CEB). While measures are being taken to improve operational
efficiency and financial management, the government has already allowed considerable
upward adjustment of energy prices both in 2012 and 2013. This politically sensitive and
bold decision to make the necessary upward adjustments of energy prices reflects
authorities’ commitment to improve financial viability of these entities. Accordingly, the
prices of petroleum products were raised by 37 – 51 percent in February 2012 and further
adjustments were made in December 2012. Moreover, the sale of heavy fuels to CEB at
below cost price, a major source of CPC losses, was discontinued from April 2013. With
respect to CEB, a substantial tariff increase of around 35 percent was implemented from
April 20, 2013, in addition to the fuel adjustment charge (FAC) ranging between
25-40 percent of the monthly bill implemented from February 2012. With the
commissioning of the low cost 600 MW coal power plant in 2014, it is expected that
these entities will reach breakeven level by end 2014.
Strengthening Trade and Broadening Growth
15.
Sri Lanka has one of the most open and least protective trade regimes in the
region in terms of tariff and non-tariff barriers as Sri Lanka commenced liberalization of
external trade since 1977, well before other countries in the region. Therefore, our
authorities do not agree with the staff view that Sri Lanka is moving towards a more
protectionist tariff regime. In the recent few years, import duties for very few agricultural
products have been changed to maintain stable domestic prices for farmers, especially in
the Northern and Eastern Province after the end of the conflict as a large extent of fertile
land was opened for cultivation. Hence, import duties on certain agricultural items are
increased during the harvesting season and reduced during the off-season, so that prices

remain stable throughout the year for farmers and consumers. This cannot be considered
as a protectionism measure and in fact this should be encouraged from food security point
of view. Further, the total import value of such items was less than 2 percent of total
imports in 2012.

The rapid development of infrastructure, improvements to the business climate,
fiscal incentives, improved access to finance and relaxation of capital account
transactions, will help to increase export oriented investments. At the same time, our
authorities have recognized that Sri Lanka has an enormous potential to substantially
increase services exports as witnessed in recent years in the areas of tourism, ports,
aviation and ICT and BPO. Net services income in the BOP has increased 3 fold since
2008. Actual FDI inflows have also increased to record levels in recent years, although
they are below the authorities’ ambitious targets, mainly due to current global situation.
Conclusion
17.
Our authorities are committed to further strengthening macroeconomic stability
and building buffers to improve resilience. Supported by continued post conflict
optimism, infrastructure development, improved business climate, political stability and
appropriate policy, Sri Lanka’s economy is expected to return to a high growth trajectory,
though conditional on recovery in external demand. Being committed to fiscal
consolidation, the government will take appropriate measures to strengthen the revenue
base and improve Public Financial Management Reforms, with help from the Fund’s TA
programme. The substantial adjustment in energy prices and reforms to enhance
operational and financial management of key State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) will help
to improve their financial viability and reduce possible burden on the budget and the
banking system. A TA team from the Fund is presently in Sri Lanka for consultations on
SOE Governance. Our authorities support the proposed PPM and acknowledge the
fruitful engagement with the Fund and look forward to strengthening the cooperation.
