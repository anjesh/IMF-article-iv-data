IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with Namibia

On September 18, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Namibia.1
Namibia has maintained robust Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth since the global
financial crisis, although in 2014 it was somewhat weaker. The GDP growth slightly moderated
to 4½ percent in 2014, largely owing to lower global demand for Namibia’s main export
commodities (e.g., diamond, uranium). Inflation remained contained, due to low international
commodity prices (e.g., fuel). The government’s large scale fiscal program contributed to job
creation, and unemployment declined somewhat (to 28 percent in 2014).
Growth performance has been underpinned by a rapid increase in credit. Average annual growth
of private sector credit has exceeded 15 percent since 2012, with strong demand from both
households and corporates. This credit expansion has been boosted by historically low interest
rates, following South Africa’s monetary policy. Net credit to the government has also risen to
meet its large domestic financing needs.
Namibia’s fiscal policy stays expansionary, to promote growth and employment. In 2014/15,
though the Southern African Customs Union (SACU) revenues and domestic revenues increased,
the government increased its recurrent and capital expenditures more, resulting in an overall
fiscal deficit of 3¾ percent of GDP. For 2015/16, the budget envisages a larger deficit, with
increased expenditures and lower SACU revenues (declined by 1¾ percent of GDP from
2014/15). In light of the financing needs, the government has been exploring the scope for
tapping international capital markets.
These developments resulted in increased pressure on external balances, while house prices also
rose. With the significant increase in import demand, the current account continued to deteriorate
in 2014, and international reserves declined to 1½ months of imports by May 2015. House prices
have increased by 87 percent over the last five years, driven by several factors (e.g., the growth
in disposable income, relatively low interest rates, purchases for short term capital gains, and
structural factors).

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A
staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country's economic
developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board.

2

Namibia’s growth outlook is clouded with downside risks, while facing significant policy
challenges. The main near-term risks are associated with (i) highly volatile SACU revenues,
(ii) rapid growth of house prices, and (iii) external environment. In addition, Namibia continues
to face serious development challenges, including high unemployment and inequality. Its main
policy challenges are therefore to strengthen its resilience to exogenous shocks and manage
systemic risks in the financial sector, while promoting inclusive growth and job creation.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal. They commended Namibia’s
robust macroeconomic performance following the global financial crisis. While medium-term
growth prospects remain good, they noted that risks are increasing. The recent expansionary
fiscal policy—while contributing to job creation—has increased pressure on external balances
and put downward pressure on international reserves. Volatile revenues from the Southern
African Customs Union (SACU) and rising housing prices are adding to uncertainties. Against
this backdrop, Directors called for continued commitment to sound policies and structural
reforms to build adequate policy buffers, preserve financial sector stability, and reduce
unemployment and inequality.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to pursue growth-friendly fiscal consolidation,
noting that a sustained effort will be needed with the aim to build international reserves. They
stressed the importance of containing the government wage bill and reducing subsidies and
transfers to state-owned enterprises, as well as strengthening revenue administration and public
financial management, while safeguarding critical social and development needs. In view of the
prospective decline in SACU revenues, they also suggested that tapping international capital
markets could help increase buffers, but noted that the associated interest rate, rollover, and
exchange rate risks need to be managed carefully. Directors commended the authorities’ plan to
undertake a midyear budget review, which would incorporate their fiscal consolidation measures.
Directors acknowledged that Namibia’s financial system is generally sound, but called for
vigilance on recent housing market developments. They highlighted the close macrofinancial
linkages, and cautioned that accelerating real estate prices―combined with high concentration of
banks’ mortgage lending―could pose risks to the financial sector and the real economy. In this
respect, Directors commended the Bank of Namibia for its plan to introduce loan-to-value limits
for nonprimary resident purchases, and recommended further targeted macroprudential measures
to safeguard financial stability. In light of the significant size of nonbank financial institutions
and their close inter-linkages, greater supervision of this sector is essential. Directors also
encouraged further steps to enhance cross-border coordination.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to address high unemployment and inequality. In
view of high youth unemployment, Directors supported the authorities’ objective to reduce skill

mismatches through improving education and job-related skills development. They also
emphasized the importance of further improving business conditions and facilitating financial
intermediation with proper supervisory oversight.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
September 1, 2015

KEY ISSUES
Context. Namibia has achieved robust growth with price stability, though high
unemployment and inequality persist. Its expansionary fiscal policy―while contributing to
job creation―has increased pressures on external balances, lowering international
reserves to 1½ months of imports.
Risks. The near-term outlook is clouded with risks. Revenues from the Southern African
Customs Union (SACU) are expected to decline in coming years, reflecting the slowdown
in the South African economy. Rising house prices, combined with commercial banks’ high
exposure to mortgages, raise macroprudential concerns. These risks, unless properly
addressed, could weaken growth and increase the economy’s fragility.
Strengthening international reserve buffer. A tighter fiscal policy stance—coupled with
additional external financing—could strengthen international reserves over the medium
term, while preserving critical social spending.
Safeguarding financial stability. The rapid rise in real estate prices—combined with the
high concentration of banks’ mortgage lending—poses risks to the financial sector and
the economy. This risk should be promptly addressed through targeted macroprudential
policies and improved supervision of links between the banking and nonbank financial
sector.
Addressing unemployment. Namibia’s key challenges are its high income inequality and
structural unemployment. To tackle them, it is important to enhance skills development
and vocational training and upgrade the education quality, while promoting private sector
investment, including through further improvement in business conditions.
Past advice. There was broad agreement with the authorities on macroeconomic policies
and structural reform priorities, but the implementation of past advice has been uneven.
Specifically, although they acknowledged the need to pursue a growth-friendly fiscal
consolidation and rein in current spending, there have been no major policy changes since
the last consultation.

CONTEXT: ROBUST GROWTH WITH RISKS
1.
Namibia is a small, upper middle-income country with close economic linkages to
South Africa. With Lesotho, Swaziland, and South Africa, Namibia is a member of the Common
Monetary Area (CMA). Under the CMA, the Namibian dollar is pegged at par to the South African
rand, which is also legal tender in the country. CMA members and Botswana constitute the Southern
African Customs Union (SACU).
2.
Namibia has maintained robust growth since the global financial crisis, although in
2014 it was somewhat weaker (Figure 1). Despite strong growth in construction activities in mining
and housing sectors, real GDP growth moderated to 4½ percent in 2014 (from 5 percent in 2013),
largely owing to lower global demand for Namibia’s main export commodities (e.g., diamond, and
uranium).1 Inflation remained contained, due to low international commodity prices (e.g. fuel). The

in construction), and unemployment declined

Growth performance has been underpinned
by a rapid increase in credit (Box 1). Average annual
growth of private sector credit has exceeded
15 percent since 2012, with strong demand from both
households and corporates (particularly construction,
real estate, and trade and accommodation). Private
credit expansion has been boosted by historically low
interest rates, following South Africa’s monetary policy.
Net credit to the government has also risen, reflecting
the expansionary fiscal policy stance. Overall money
supply grew by 14.3 percent (year-on-year) as of May
2015. Rapid credit growth over the last decade has
been accompanied by improved access to financial
services, with a larger share of the Namibian
population having access to financial services. 3

In view of high international commodity prices from 2000 through 2011, Namibia experienced a wave of
exploration and investments. The three largest developments in the sector include: (i) the Otjikoto gold mine (from
December 2014), (ii) the Tschudi copper mine (from February 2015), and (iii) the Husab uranium mine (from end
2016). Despite the recent decline in commodity prices, these investments are expected to continue, as they are at an
advanced phase. These new mines will further contribute to growth over the next few years (mining is expected to
account for 15 percent of GDP by 2018).
2

To respond to the high unemployment in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, the authorities implemented
the Targeted Intervention Program for Employment and Economic Growth for 2011/12‒2013/14, with a three-year
large-scale fiscal expansion (with a budget allocation of N$9.1 billion (10 percent of GDP)).

Namibia’s fiscal policy remains expansionary, to promote growth and employment. In
2014/15, supported by relatively high SACU revenues and further efforts in domestic revenue
collection (e.g., enhanced collection of tax arrears and higher compliance), the government
increased its expenditures (e.g., wages, goods and services, and capital spending), resulting in an
overall fiscal deficit of 3¾ percent

According to FinScope, the ratio of Namibian population excluded from financial services declined from 52 percent
in 2007 to 31 percent in 2011, close to the target (26 percent) of the Namibia Financial Sector Strategy (NFSS).

As part of the revenue collection efforts, a Large Taxpayer Office was established in June 2014, which contributed to
improving tax compliance rates in Windhoek and satellite cities. A dedicated tax collection unit will be fully
operational in 2015/16 which will help reduce tax evasion in remote areas.
5

The increase in personnel cost was mainly due to a civil service salary increase (of 10 percent), coupled with the
implementation of the "job evaluation and regrading" system which resulted in notch increase of 2 percent.
6

Subsidies and transfers are expected to increase by 0.9 percentage points of GDP from 2014/15, owing to an
increase in financial support to public enterprises for: (i) strengthening the medical care of public servants,
(ii) enhancing the educational assistance (financial aid to students and universities to improve access to vocational
training and tertiary education), and (ii) developing and rehabilitating of infrastructure (railway, airport, and road
maintenance).
7

The authorities acknowledged that their revenue estimates are overstated and plan to reassess revenue forecast in
the upcoming mid-year budget review (in October).
8

The Namibian government has issued foreign bonds in the recent past: (i) a US$500 million Eurobond in
October 2011, (ii) a ZAR 850 million 10-year bond on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) in November 2012, and
(iii) ZAR 800 million 5-year and 7-year bonds on the JSE in June 2015. As of July 2015, Namibia retains Baa3 rating
from Moody’s and BBB rating from Fitch.

Box 1. Credit and GDP Growth and Financial Stability
Time series analysis suggests the existence of a long-term relation between domestic credit to the private sector and
economic growth in Namibia, despite the fact that a short-term direction of causality could not be identified. Rapid
credit expansion, however, raises concerns in terms of financial stability.

The direction of the short-term causal
relationship between private domestic credit
and GDP growth could not be identified using
VAR-based estimates. The lack of Granger
causality between private domestic credit (from
1
banks) and output could be attributable to three
factors: (i) domestic credit flows mainly to the
construction and real estate sectors, whose share of
GDP is relatively small (about 8 percent); (ii)
economic activity in Namibia largely depends on
government spending and mining activities (mostly
financed with external flows); and (iii) private credit
and GDP growth appear to be coincident indicators
and this potential simultaneity makes the
estimation of the direction of causality difficult (see
Figure).



However, a cointegration analysis reveals the existence of a long-term relationship between credit
and output. The Johansen test reveals the existence of a cointegration equation between the quarterly series
of credit and GDP (a long-term relationship). According to these estimates, based on a VECM specification
with 4 lags, a 1 percent increase in real credit is associated with a 0.47 percent increase in real GDP in the
long-run. In addition to the direct contribution to the construction and real estate sectors, financial
intermediation is expected to support growth through the mobilization of savings, promotion of information
sharing, enhancement of resource allocation, and risk management. In Namibia bank credit is also critical to
provide trade finance and thus facilitates mining and construction activities.



The large credit expansion might have been
accompanied by systemic risk build-up. Despite
the positive effects on growth, rapid credit growth
and concentration in the loan book (Box 3) raise
financial stability concerns, through contributing to
pushing house prices above fundamentals. The
analysis of the credit-to-GDP gap could not confirm
excessive credit growth, as the credit-to-GDP ratio
has been below its historical trend over the past
few years (see Figure). The interpretation of this,
however, warrants some caution, given that the
very rapid credit growth following independence
may have biased upward the long-term trend.
Furthermore, overall credit may mask potential risks
contained in specific sectors (e.g., growth in
personal loans).

1/ In the absence of information on credit from non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs), the analysis is based on bank credit to the
private sector. The contribution of NBFIs to private sector intermediation is, however, expected to be limited, as NBFIs invest
mainly in government bonds, bank deposits, and dual listed companies (in South Africa and Namibia).

These developments resulted in increased pressure on external balances, while real
estate prices have risen. With a significant increase in import demand (partly associated with
construction requirements of the mining sector), the current account continued to deteriorate in
2014, and international reserves declined to 1½ months of imports by May 2015. House prices have
risen significantly over the past years, driven by the growth in disposable income, relatively low
interest rates, accommodative fiscal policies, purchases for short-term capital gains, and structural
factors (urbanization, shortage in the supply of housing and serviced land, etc.).
With increasing import demand, pressures on international
reserves are mounting.

House prices have increased by 87 percent over the

The government’s policy priority is to continue to address social and development
challenges. In the recent presidential and parliamentary elections in November 2014, the South
West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) party obtained a landslide victory.9 The new
government indicated its intention to: (i) continue to address significant social and development
challenges, (ii) ameliorate the persistently high unemployment, inequality, and poverty,
(iii) safeguard macroeconomic policies, and (iv) promote economic diversification and
transformation of the Namibian economy to be more inclusive and resilient to shocks.
7.
Namibia’s real effective exchange rate appears moderately overvalued (Annex 2).
Namibia’s current account continued to deteriorate since its peak in 2006, owing to the large import
needs associated with investments in the mining sector and the expansionary fiscal policy. The IMF
staff’s estimates suggest the exchange rate could be about 8 percent overvalued. The current
account, however, might not necessarily improve with the exchange rate depreciation by this
degree, as far as the expansionary fiscal policy continues.

The SWAPO party has ruled Namibia since independence in 1990. President Hage Geingob (former prime minister)
and Prime Minister Kuugongelwa-Amadhila (former minister of finance) were sworn in on March 21, 2015, together
with new cabinet members, including the Minister of Finance Calle Schlettwein (former minister of trade).

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
8.
Namibia’s growth outlook―5 percent on average during 2015–2020―is positive, but
clouded with downside risks (Annex IV). Growth is expected to pick up slightly to 6 percent by
2017/18, supported by mining and construction sectors, then somewhat weaken over the medium
term, once the production from new mines (copper, gold, uranium) reaches full capacity. The
baseline scenario assumes a significant decline in SACU revenues in coming years. The main nearterm risks are associated with (i) the highly volatile SACU revenues (about one-third of fiscal
revenues) and the risk of a decline beyond what is captured in the baseline, (ii) rapid growth of
house prices, and (iii) external environment.


Emerging uncertainty for the prospects
of SACU revenues poses risk to the
economy. In coming years, reflecting the
slowdown in the South African economy,
SACU revenues are projected to decline
as a share of GDP.10 Further increases in
the current account deficit could erode
already low international reserves.

The SACU revenues are expected to decline in coming
years.

Possible deterioration in external environments also pose risk to the economy. If
international capital flows to South Africa will significantly decline, adverse spillovers to
Namibia would rise, possibly channeled through lower trade, financial flows, and SACU
revenues. In addition, further deterioration of the euro-area economies may generate
significant negative spillovers to the Namibian economy through trade linkages as a large
share of Namibia’s total exports—mainly uranium ore, diamonds, beef, unrefined copper
and fish—are destined for the European market. Finally, given its export base, Namibia
remains vulnerable to further decline in international prices of its main commodity exports.

The authorities share staff’s concerns and are addressing the policy options to deal
with emerging risks. The authorities concur with staff’s concern on the prospects for SACU
revenues and other risks. To respond to the possible SACU revenue fall, the authorities plan to
adopt a tighter fiscal policy stance, so that it would avoid crowding out private sector credit, and
would allow for the robust growth momentum to continue―supported by mining, construction, and
services sectors.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Namibia’s main short-term challenges are to build adequate international reserves to strengthen its
resilience to exogenous shocks and manage systemic risks in the financial sector. From a longer-term
perspective, promoting inclusive growth and job creation remain key priorities. The 2015 Article IV
consultation focused on how Namibia can address these challenges and risks.

A. Reducing External Vulnerabilities
Risks from low international reserves
10.
Namibia’s international reserves have markedly declined since 2009, making it
vulnerable to exogenous shocks under the exchange rate peg. The reserves stood at
US$1 billion (8¼ percent of GDP or 1½ months of imports) as of end-May 2015, declining by about
9 percent points of GDP since 2009, while Namibia’s external balances are heavily dependent on
volatile inflows (exports of mineral products and SACU revenues).
11.
According to the IMF’s metric for market access countries, Namibia’s international
reserves are significantly below their adequate level. The current level of reserves is only about
60 percent of the minimum adequate level (3‒5 months of imports or 16‒20 percent of GDP,
Annex 1). Moreover, in the past fifteen years the level of reserves has been sub-optimal about
seventy percent of the time. Given Namibia’s membership in the CMA (and, hence, the peg to the
South African rand), sub-optimal reserves make the country more vulnerable to exogenous shocks.
The authorities concurred with the need to build adequate international reserves and agreed with
the proposed level of 3‒5 months of imports (as it coincides with the Bank of Namibia’s (BoN’s) own
estimates).
12.
Staff’s baseline scenario envisages a moderate fiscal consolidation with enhanced
external financing, though not enough to sufficiently raise international reserves. Under this
scenario, growth would rise to 6 percent by 2017/18 supported by mining and construction. Fiscal
balances would be broadly consistent with the government’s current medium-term indicative target
(deficits of 5 percent of GDP on average over the medium term), with upfront consolidation efforts.
However, due to the lack of detail of government’s consolidation plans over the medium term, the
pace of adjustment is assumed to stall after a few years (consolidation fatigue). External financing of
about N$12 billion (6 percent of GDP) would be required over the next five years to mitigate the
impact of the SACU revenue shock. As a result, international reserves would remain at around

1½‒2 months of imports, and public debt would exceed the government’s target of 35 percent of
GDP.

over the medium term, with a view to increasing the

financing) of about N$12 billion over the next five

medium term are called for with the following policy
measures:

Contain expenditures, based on a growth-friendly
fiscal consolidation strategy―aiming to rein in current spending (wages and transfers and
subsidies to public enterprises) while preserving productive infrastructure spending (as
discussed for the 2013 Article IV consultation)―could mitigate the negative impact on the
economy. For this purpose, it is important to restrain non-priority spending (particularly in
goods and services and subsidies, and transfers to public enterprises) and the wage bill. Policy
measures for constraining the wage bill include: (i) freezing wages in real terms, (ii) limiting new

hiring to critical areas (e.g., education, health), and (iii) reducing various allowances, overtime,
and bonus payments.11,12 As an initial step, the government plans to reduce travel expenses (by
enforcing a limit on the number of official trips per year).


Enhance revenue administration. Further efforts for domestic revenue collection—including
through improving tax compliance, reducing tax expenditures, and prioritizing the collection of
tax arrears—are essential to the consolidation (as they would limit the reliance on expenditure
cuts).



Increase external financing, within the government’s debt ceiling. In view of the relatively low level
of Namibia’s public debt, external financing—through external bond (preferably rand
denominated) or other options (e.g., borrowing from international partners, or credit lines)—
should be sought, while carefully assessing the associated interest rate and rollover risks, in light
of the envisaged normalization of monetary policy in advanced countries. It is also essential to
(i) monitor the liabilities of all regional and local authorities and the fiscal risk from increasing
explicit/implicit sovereign guarantees for public enterprises, and (ii) diversify the debt portfolio
(to reduce rollover risks).



Support fiscal consolidation with structural measures, including strengthening public financial
management (e.g., introducing a single treasury account, conducting public expenditure reviews,
enacting a new public financial management bill), improving data reporting and monitoring of
state-owned enterprises, revising public procurement bill, and strengthening public investment
management (e.g., improving project appraisals and implementation). These efforts, together
with enhanced domestic revenue collection, would help to create a fiscal space for critical social
and development spending and to mitigate the adverse impacts of consolidation on growth,
while maintaining capital expenditures.

14.
The authorities affirmed their intention to tighten their fiscal policy stance, with
stepped-up revenue efforts and expenditure control, along the lines envisaged under the
reform scenario. They concurred with the need to rein in spending, improve its quality, and
enhance external financing, while supporting the country’s development needs. They pointed that
there would be scope for rationalizing government’s transfers to public enterprises (by 2¼
percentage points of GDP) by strengthening their monitoring, while acknowledging the importance
of containing wages. They agreed with the need to strengthen international reserves (as envisaged
under the reform scenario), while noting that the degree of spending cuts could be mitigated, by
further improving domestic revenue administration and exploring the scope for public-private
partnerships. Over the medium term, improvements in tax collection are expected from the
establishment of an autonomous revenue agency. Furthermore, the authorities intend to improve
spending efficiency, through strengthening their cash management and expenditure control (e.g., by
introducing a real-time budget reporting system). For the first time, the government is planning to
undertake a midyear budget review (in October) to update their medium-term fiscal framework with
the SACU revenue shock and specify their intended fiscal consolidation measures.

B. Managing Systemic Risks in the Financial Sector
15.
Namibia has enjoyed steady financial sector developments. The banking system is well
capitalized and profitable, with low levels of nonperforming loans (Table 6). Nonbank financial
institutions (NBFIs) are also well capitalized, with the average solvency level exceeding the statutory
requirement. Both the banking sector and NBFIs expanded rapidly, underpinning Namibia’s robust
growth performance. Vigorous private credit growth (to both household and corporate sectors) has
buoyed economic activity mainly through its contributions to construction and real estate.
16.
These developments, however, have been accompanied by a potential buildup of
macrofinancial risks. Namibia’s financial sector has a complex structure, interconnected internally
and externally, with potential for system-wide and cross-border contagion (Box 2). The Namibian
banking sector is well regulated, while there is a scope to further strengthen the NBFI supervision. In
addition, house prices have been increasing since independence, raising concern about a potential
real estate bubble, whose risks are heightened by the high concentration of banks’ loan book in
mortgages and the elevated households’ indebtedness (Box 3).

NAMIBIA

Box 2. Structure of Financial Sector1
Namibia has a complex and tiered financial system
structure, which is closely interconnected, with tight
links to South African markets and institutions. NBFIs—
mainly consisting of long-term insurance, pension
funds, investment managers, and unit trusts—dominate
the financial system, in terms of asset size. The banking
sector is comparatively small and highly concentrated,
with the four biggest banks (of which three are South
African subsidiaries) controlling more than 90 percent
of the total assets in the sector.

To ensure coordination among the relevant authorities on matters related to financial stability, in 2014 the Financial

In view of the structure of the financial sector, the following sources of systemic risks can be identified:




The NBFIs—given their large size and
interconnectedness—could be source of systemic
risk. Interlinkages have different forms, through
cross-ownerships by a few large conglomerates and
also through funding and debt exposures with unit
trusts and asset managers playing a central role
(Figure). The tight linkages of NBFIs with banking
institutions increase the potential for system-wide
contagion.

Figure. Funding Links within Namibia’s Financial
System

Namibia’s financial system has many cross-border
links, especially with South Africa. Three of the four
largest banks in Namibia are subsidiaries of South
African banks. These interlinkages expose Namibia
to potential channels of contagion and systemic
risks, while funding flows from South Africa to
Namibia’s financial institutions are currently limited.

Namibia’s real estate prices have recorded a sharp increase over the past several years, though the pace of increase
softened somewhat in recent months. The house price index (estimated by the First National Bank (FNB)) indicates
that between 2009 and 2014 the average price of properties in the residential segment increased by about 85

Multiple factors—fundamental, cyclical, and speculative factors—have contributed to soaring house prices.
Specifically these factors include: (i) urbanization and migration of population from rural areas to major cities;
(ii) increase in disposable income; (iii) acute shortage of supply due to the slow provision of serviced land by local
authorities; (iv) low interest rates; (v) fiscal expansion and government incentive programs for home loans; (vi) home
purchases for investment purposes, including some cash buying by foreigners.
Staff’s assessment—based on (i) common housing ratios, and (ii) regression analysis—suggests that the recent
house price surge at the current pace might not be sustainable. At a national level, house price over-valuation is
estimated at around 20 percent. The over-valuation is

A possible sharp reversal of the prevailing house price
trend could impact financial stability in view of banks’
high exposure to the real estate sector (with the mortgage
sector accounting for 52 percent of total loans at end2014) and high household debt of disposable income
(estimated by the BoN at around 85 percent in 2014).

17.
A few sources of systemic risks, potentially affecting financial stability and the
economy, are identified.


Possible house price correction (Box 3 and the Selected Issues Paper). The staff’s stresstesting exercise—based on a possible overvaluation of house prices by up to
20 percent―suggests some resilience of the banking sector.13 Under severe but plausible risk
scenarios (entailing a moderate house price correction, a mild increase in interest rates, and
decline in commodity prices), all banks would be able to absorb the shocks with their large
capital buffers and remain compliant. However, in the most adverse tail-risk scenarios (entailing
large house price correction and significant increase in interest rates, followed by severe
economic recession), some banks could face difficulty in complying with the capital requirement.
Under the most extreme scenario, commercial bank credit could drop significantly three years
after the shock, and growth could potentially decline by about 10 percent.



Potential outflow of banks’ wholesale deposits. Commercial banks rely largely on wholesale
funding, mainly in the form of short-term wholesale deposits (70‒80 percent of total bank
funding). Short maturities of this funding, against long maturities of bank assets, expose banking
institutions to liquidity and maturity risks. These risks are heightened by the low level of
international reserves that, in the context of the fixed exchange rate regime, could challenge the
BoN‘s capacity to act as a lender of the last resort.



Large NBFIs and their close inter-linkages with banks (Box 2). NBFIs’ deposits are the most
significant source of funding for banks. These funding linkages, together with tight ownership
links, create the potential for system-wide contagion, which calls for close monitoring of their
activities, although significant data and resource gaps make such oversight challenging.



Cross border financial linkages (Box 2). Namibia’s financial system has many cross-border
links, especially with South Africa, through cross-border investments and ownership, which
expose the country to contagion and systemic risk shocks.

18.
In light of these risks, targeted macroprudential measures should be explored to
enhance the resilience of the financial system, while carefully monitoring the developments in
real estate markets and the financial sector. Those measures include:14


Introducing loan-to-value ratio (LTV) and debt service-to-income ratio (DSTI) limits.
While underlying distortions in the real estate markets should be addressed, targeted

13

Since independence, Namibia has never experienced a financial crisis, thus the stress testing exercise uses crosscountry evidence of large reductions in housing prices, while exploring four scenarios: (i) a modest decline in house
prices and a decline in oil prices that reduces cash purchases from foreign investors, (ii) a modest decline in house
prices and a decline in international prices of Namibia’s export commodities, (iii) a large decline in house prices, a
decline in international prices of Namibia’s export commodities, and significant increase in interest rates, and (iv) a
severe economic recession accompanied by a significant decline in house prices and in private sector credit.
14

Policy advice in this area is based on the recommendations from the IMF technical assistance on macroprudential
policies (June 2015).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

NAMIBIA

macroprudential policies could be considered to mitigate systemic risks. In particular, LTV
limits on non-primary residences―under consideration by the BoN―could constrain house
purchases financed with mortgage loans for investment purposes. The limits could be
complemented by DSTI limits, because LTV limits become less binding as property prices
increase. As these limits are subject to the risk of leakage, it is important to closely monitor
nonbank activities and extend the limits to other financial institutions engaged in real estate
business. In addition, as risks to the financial system may arise from primary residential
mortgages, Staff suggested the BoN to also consider imposing, as needed, LTV limits on
primary residences to limit households’ indebtedness and vulnerability to a house price shock.
These measures should be designed, calibrated, and timed to mitigate financial stability risks
without hampering affordability for lower income groups and causing excessive house price
corrections, which may have financial stability implications. Furthermore, as these
macroprudential policies cannot address the underlying drivers of rising real estate prices
(including the acute supply constraints, delays in the delivery of serviced land, and the absence
of a capital gains tax), they should go hand in hand with efforts to address these causes.
Deeper financial markets can also offer alternative investment options and help reduce
speculative housing demand.


Further strengthening the supervision of NBFIs. While NAMFISA has made progress in
strengthening its capacity to supervise and regulate nonbank financial institutions, the
Financial Institutions and Markets (FIM) Bill―which provides a modernized and flexible
regulatory and supervisory framework―needs to be enacted soon. To strengthen financial
stability, NAMFISA could adopt additional criteria for its risk-based supervision, to capture
institutions’ contribution to systemic risks, such as size, complexity, and interconnectedness.
NAMFISA’s significant resource and capacity constraints need to be addressed to implement
the new framework.



Further enhancing cross-border coordination. While the authorities have been proactive in
such coordination, there is scope to explore further measures. MOUs are in place with the
SARB, South Africa’s Financial Services Board, and the Bank of Botswana. The BoN regularly
participates in supervisory colleges for South African banking groups. Nevertheless, given the
important cross-border links between the Namibian and South African financial systems,
macroprudential measures adopted would need coordination, including through reciprocity
agreements. In addition, the existing MOUs with SARB for cross-border banks should be
expanded to cover resolution and crisis management (see IMF Country Report No. 14/340).
Cross-border cooperation for the insurance sector (including on coordination on crisis
management) should also be strengthened, given the systemic size of these institutions.15

15

The recent Financial System Stability Assessment (FSSA) suggests that South Africa's banking system is well
capitalized and profitable, although banks need larger liquidity capacity to meet Basel regulatory requirements by
2018. The FSSA identifies slow growth and rising interest rates as major risks to the banking sector.

16



Establishing a body in charge of macroprudential policy. This entails: (i) giving this body an
explicit macro-prudential mandate, and the necessary legal powers to exercise it; and
(ii) providing this body with experienced staff, the availability of granular data and an
enhanced IT framework.



Addressing information and data gaps. Improving data availability is a prerequisite for risk
identification and to conduct effective macroprudential policies. Improving granular data
collection should be prioritized with a defined time schedule. Staff acknowledges the
authorities’ efforts to address the data gaps, including BoN’s ongoing work to develop a new
housing index (together with NSA and the Deeds office) and NAMFISA’s commitment to
develop FSIs for the non-bank financial sector with IMF technical assistance.



Leveraging on recent progress in AML/CFL legislation. Significant progress in enhancing
the AML/CFT regime resulted in Namibia’s recent exit from the Financial Action Task Force
monitoring process. In preparation for the next assessment in 2017, authorities are
encouraged to effectively utilize AML/CFT tools in order to protect against national money
laundering/terrorist financing risks and ensure financial stability.

19.
The authorities concurred with staff’s assessment of systemic risk and the need for
macroprudential policies. Fully acknowledging the risks associated with rising house prices, the
BON intends to introduce LTV limits for non-primary residences and explore further measures as
needed, although imposing LTV limits for primary residences will be difficult, in light of Namibia’s
housing shortage. NAMFISA concurred with the need to enhance its capacity and seek for technical
assistance, while waiting for the enactment of the FIM Bill. The authorities recognized the
importance of having a strong institutional framework to conduct macroprudential policy and
explained the setup of the FSSC as a step to increase the involvement of and coordination across
relevant institutions (BoN, NAMFISA, and MoF). To formalize the objectives and functions of the
FSSC, the authorities are currently working on a MOU.

C. Lowering Unemployment and Diversifying the Economy
20.
Namibia continues to face persistently high unemployment—particularly among the
youth. The implementation of the Targeted Intervention Programme for Employment and Economic
Growth in 2011/12‒2013/14 led to significant job creation (including many temporary construction
jobs). However, according to the 2014 labor force survey, youth unemployment rate remains
particularly high (39.2 percent), suggesting significant underutilization of labor. Furthermore, this
underscores Namibia’s key challenge of lack of skilled labor or marketable skills among the young.16

16

It is commonly accepted in Namibia that the probability of employment increases significantly with tertiary
education. According to the latest Labor Force Survey 2014, the highest unemployment rates are found amongst
persons with junior secondary and primary education (34.2 and29.5 percent respectively), before falling sharply with
tertiary education.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

NAMIBIA

The government plans to step up its efforts in this area, by introducing free secondary education
(from 2016), expanding the secondary school system through enrolment in vocational education,
implementing the skills levy, and establishing entrepreneurship training and internships.
21.
Despite some progress in economic diversification, it has not led to sufficient job
creation. Although the share of mining in GDP has gradually increased (as investment activities
have been tilted toward this sector), it is by nature not labor intensive. On the other hand, there has
been modest investment in labor-intensive industries (e.g., manufacturing), while the Namibian
authorities embarked on an export diversification strategy through the creation of export processing
zones (EPZ) focusing on manufacturing. In view of the relatively limited outcome of the policy, the
government intends to gradually phase out the EPZ with a view to moving from its cash and tax
incentives towards infrastructure and technology incentives. In the meantime, the government has
been implementing the “Growth at Home” strategy which focuses on three strategic intervention
areas: (i) supporting value addition, upgrading and diversification for sustained growth, (ii) securing
market access at home and abroad, and (iii) improving the investment climate.17
22.
Namibia has maintained a relatively high ranking in the Doing Business Index (88th out
of 189), but weaknesses remain in the ease of starting a business, registering property, and
access to finance.18 The authorities share the need to improve business condition and are taking
steps to establish a one-stop shop for investors to significantly reduce the time and procedures
required to start a business; through the Investment Bill and the creation of the Business and
Intellectual Property Authority. According to the 2014 Enterprise Surveys (conducted by the World
Bank), access to finance is perceived by firms as the biggest business environment obstacle, despite
the progress in financial inclusion.
23.
To promote job creation and address high youth unemployment, in addition to the
above-mentioned growth-friendly fiscal consolidation, policy efforts from multiple
perspectives are called for. Previous staff assessments identified skill mismatches as one of the key
causes of Namibia’s high unemployment (Appendix V, IMC Country Report No. 13/43). It can be also
partly attributed to (i) the lack of progress in economic diversification, in particular in labor-intensive
industries, (ii) lack of marketable skills, and (iii) inadequate business conditions to attract higher
private sector investment. While the government is stepping up efforts to address unemployment,
further improvements in the following areas would be particularly important:


Further improve business conditions to encourage investment in labor-intensive production
(e.g., manufacturing), including through reducing costs and procedures for opening a
business.

17

Under this strategy, the authorities have expanded strategic industries to include agro and fish processing, steel
manufacturing and metal fabrication, automotive, chemical, and jewelry industry.
18

These indicators should be interpreted with caution owing to a limited number of respondents, a limited
geographical coverage, and standardized assumptions on business constraints and information availability.

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NAMIBIA



Facilitate financial intermediation with proper supervisory oversight. Despite the steady
progress in financial inclusion, continuous efforts to improve financial inclusion are
important, while safeguarding financial stability. Following the BoN’s initiative to conduct the
intermediate assessment of the Namibia Financial Sector Strategy, a scope for an FSAP could
be sought to obtain a comprehensive assessment.



Reduce skill mismatches, through improving education and job related skills to improve
employability. In light of the high youth unemployment, it is especially important to equip
the youth (during secondary school) with marketable job skills and enhance skills
development and vocational training for those unemployed. To this end, the authorities
should (i) ameliorate the curriculum and quality of basic education, (ii) upgrade the quality
of teachers, and (iii) revamp the mapping between the national development strategy and
industry’s needs through the design of improved skill training at vocational schools. Policy
actions in these areas, set under the Fourth National Development Plan (NDP4) for the
period 2012/13-2016/17, should be swiftly implemented.

24.
The authorities shared the urgent need to address high unemployment and inequality.
Job creation is a priority for the new government. To this end, it plans to focus on infrastructure
investments (such as transportation and energy) to create jobs and enhance long term growth.
Acknowledging the temporary nature of these jobs, the authorities argue that they have identified
strategic industries such as agri-business, logistics, tourism, and manufacturing, with a view to
enhancing job creation over the long term. Furthermore, recognizing the mismatch of skills, the
government intends to improve education and job-related skills aimed at employability and
transitioning between sectors and productivity levels. They also point to the importance of
augmenting the quality of education spending.

STAFF APPRAISAL
25.
Since the global financial crisis, Namibia has enjoyed robust growth, buoyed by
construction in mining and housing sectors as well as the expansionary fiscal policy. Such
vigorous growth was mirrored in the rapid credit growth. These developments have raised overall
incomes and contributed to job creation, though Namibia’s unemployment remains high. In the
meantime, the pressure on external balances has increased, while real estate prices have risen.
26.
Namibia faces significant policy challenges, while its growth prospects are increasingly
clouded with downside risks. While robust growth is expected to continue in coming years led by
mining and construction, near-term risks have increased, associated the highly volatile SACU
revenues in the absence of sufficient international reserves and the potential systemic risk from
rapid real estate price increases. Those risks, unless properly addressed, could weaken growth and
adversely affect the economy’s sustainability. In this light, Namibia’s key short-term policy
challenges are therefore to build an adequate international reserve buffer to strengthen its resilience
to exogenous shocks and to manage potential systemic risks in the financial sector.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

NAMIBIA

27.
Staff welcomes the authorities’ intention to shift toward a tighter fiscal policy stance,
while safeguarding critical social and development needs. While a fiscal consolidation with
additional external financing would be essential to build adequate international reserves over the
medium term, such consolidation would need to be growth-friendly and hence contain significant
structural elements. To help implement the consolidation, it is also important to enhance the
country’s efforts for public financial management reforms and further strengthen tax administration.
For external financing, staff calls for careful assessments on the associated interest rate, rollover, and
exchange rate risks, while monitoring the liabilities of all regional and local authorities and the fiscal
risk from increasing explicit/implicit sovereign guarantees for public enterprises.
28.
Risks associated with recent housing market development should be carefully
addressed. Fast growth in real estate prices—combined with the high concentration of banks’
mortgage lending—pose risks to the financial sector and the economy. To address such risks, staff
suggested targeted macroprudential policies, including the introduction of LTV and DSTI limits. To
this end, staff welcomes the BONs plans to introduce LTV limits for non-primary resident purchases
and explore further measures as needed. Given the magnitude of the risk and its possible
consequences, macroprudential policies should be implemented promptly, while carefully assessing
their effects and consequences.
29.
Staff shares the authorities’ concern on unemployment and welcomes their intention
to address this issue as a policy priority. It is important to progress in economic diversification,
particularly in labor-intensive industries. In light of the high youth unemployment, for those with
limited access to higher education, marketable skills should be explored, through enhancing skills
development and vocational training and upgrading the education quality.
30.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation with Namibia take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

Annex I. Assessing International Reserve Adequacy
Namibia’s international reserves have continuously declined since 2009 and are far below their
optimal level according to the IMF’s metric. Given the bleak prospects for SACU transfers, and the fixed
exchange rate, it is important to implement policies that would help to secure sufficient international
reserve buffer for future shocks.

A.

Background

1.
Namibia’s international reserves have
continuously declined since their peak in 2009. In
May 2015, reserves were US$1.1 billion (8.2 percent
of GDP or 1.5 months of imports), a decline of about
9 percent of GDP since 2009.1, 2 The decline in import
coverage is larger than as a share of GDP, as imports
have soared due to the needs of large mining
construction projects currently underway.

2.
Traditional metrics of adequacy are narrowly-based and often provide conflicting
signals. Simple rules of thumb―such as (i) three months of imports, (ii) full cover of short-term debt
plus debt service, or (iii) twenty percent of broad money―are attractive for their simplicity, but are
arbitrary and more importantly only focus on one aspect of vulnerability. Since a balance of
payments crisis can arise from a range of sources, the IMF’s metric is a risk-weighted measure based
on observed outflows in past exchange market pressure events.3
3.
The IMF’s metric for market access countries encompasses different sources of risk,
such us external liabilities, trade, and measures of potential capital flight.4 More specifically it
takes into account four specific sources of risk: (i) export earnings intended to capture the potential
loss that could arise from a terms of trade shock; (ii) short term debt at remaining maturity (short
term debt plus debt service) attempts to incorporate the liquidity (rollover) risk; (iii) portfolio
investments plus medium and long-term debt, to account for other drains caused by non-residents’
1

The authorities generally concurred with the assessment from the last two Article IV consultations (in 2011 and
2013) that reserves were below their adequate level. However the reserve coverage has continued to deteriorate as
policies have remained unchanged.
2

Reserves are temporarily higher at the beginning of each quarter when SACU payments are received.

3

See further details in IMF (2011, 2013 and 2014).

4

A different IMF methodology is employed for low income countries, without market access, and where the current
account dominate the capital account shocks. This alternative is not relevant for Namibia, which is an upper middle
income country, with market access, and a fair degree of openness in the capital account (with substantial inflows
and outflows in the capital account). Namibia’s latest external issuance was a 10 year Eurobond for US$500 million in
November 2011. The government is currently considering its options for external financing but this time seems to
favor rand issuance in the South African market.

investment; and (iv) broad money used as a proxy for resident capital flight. Other potential sources
of risk, such as derivative exposures or exchange rate misalignments are not incorporated due to
data limitations for a number of countries.
4.
The weights of the sources of risk on the IMF’s metric for market access countries are
based on observed outflows during past periods of exchange market pressures. More
specifically, annual distributions of percentage changes for each of the items discussed above
during periods of exchange market pressures are computed.5 For each item, the metric takes the
drains observed at the tenth percentile of the distribution. Separate distributions are estimated for
countries with fixed exchange rate regimes.6 The weights for countries with a fixed exchange rate
are:

Namibia’s international reserves are far below their adequate level according to the
IMF’s metric for market access countries. Reserves on the range of 100-150 percent of the
composite metric are considered to be adequate. The current level of reserves is only about 60
percent of the minimum adequate level. Moreover, in the past fifteen years the level of reserves has
been sub-optimal about seventy percent of the time. More specifically, reserve coverage was only
adequate between 2007 and 2010 due to a combination of higher SACU transfers and mining
revenues, and some expenditure restraint.7

As in Eichengreen et. al. (1997) an exchange market pressure index is constructed as a weighted average of reserve
losses, exchange rate depreciation, and increases in interest rates. An episode of exchange market pressure occurs
when the index deviates more than 1.5 times its standard deviation from the average.

6

Different weights are also used for countries with capital controls or where commodity exports account for more
than 50 percent of total exports, but neither of these conditions applies for Namibia.
7

It is also important to note that in August 2009 Namibia received US$200 million from an additional SDR allocation.

It is important to implement policies that would help to secure sufficient international
reserve buffer for future shocks. Given the bleak prospects for SACU transfers, and the fixed
exchange rate, increasing the reserve holdings is highly desirable. The government should
implement a mix of fiscal restraint and additional foreign financing that would allow them to secure
sufficient buffers for future shocks.

Annex II. Exchange Rate Assessment
Staff analysis suggests that Namibia’s real effective exchange rate (REER) is moderately overvalued
compared to the level that would be consistent with fundamentals. However, the estimated
misalignment is crucially dependent on the assumption that the deterioration in the current account
(CA) mostly reflects temporary import needs from the construction of major mining projects, which are
not related to the developments of the REER and until 2013 were mostly financed with FDI.

A.

Background

1.
Namibia’s CA has continuously deteriorated since its peak in 2006. Moreover, as seen in
Figure 1, it went from persistent surpluses in the first half of
the century to an uninterrupted deterioration in the second

Namibia’s CA deficit is mostly financed with FDI and other investments. As can be seen
in Figure 4, the net portfolio investment is negative due to large investments abroad from non-bank
financial institutions. In 2014 there was a small recomposition between net FDI and other
investments, as the mining sector seems to have increased its external indebtedness to compensate

percent since end-2010 reversing the appreciation in 200910. However, the index is slightly above South Africa’s
implying some loss of competitiveness in the past three

years. Despite the depreciation, the REER remains below its
long run average which suggests a decline in the REER
consistent with fundamentals.

The assessment of Namibia’s REER is conducted with the IMF’s CA EBA-lite model. This
is an extension of EBA that covers a broader group of countries and incorporates missing
fundamentals for low and middle-income countries.1 It employs annual data for 146 countries from
1995 to 2012. It assumes the CA and REER are endogenous variables simultaneously determined as
a function of domestic and external variables (including fundamentals, policy variables, cyclical
conditions and the global environment).2 It assesses the CA and REER in a multi-lateral consistent

See further details of the EBA methodology in IMF (2013).

Since the CA and ER are measured relative to other countries, they not only reflect a country’s own characteristics
but also external conditions within a simultaneously determined general equilibrium.

manner, as each country’s variables are measured relative to a weighted-average of other countries’
values.3
5.
Namibia’s REER appears moderately overvalued. The CA gap is defined as the difference
between the observed value and the fitted values of the regression—which in turn corresponds to
deviations of policies variables from their adequate levels and to regression residuals (the
unexplained portion of the model). The CA deviation from its equilibrium value is then converted
into an REER misalignment by employing estimated import and export elasticities. For Namibia, the
CA gap is estimated to be 6.6 percent of GDP (only 1 percent of which could be attributed to policy
gaps), as the fitted value of the regression is a CA deficit of 5.5 compared to an expected value of
12.1 for 2015. The estimated elasticity of the trade balance to changes in the REER is -0.24. Thus, the
REER would need to depreciate by 27 percent for the CA deficit to be reduced to the fitted value of
the regression.
6.
Namibia’s REER misalignment is possibly smaller as the recent deterioration of the CA
does not seem closely related to the ER developments. In particular, the CA deficit will eventually
improve as imports fall once major construction projects are completed and exports increase when
new mines begin production. If imports from large construction projects are excluded, the CA deficit
would be about 4.6 percentage points of GDP lower and the estimated overvaluation in the REER
would only be about 8.3 percent.4 The overvaluation could be corrected if the government were to
successfully embark in its planned fiscal consolidation. Finally, given the fixed exchange rate with the
rand, a nominal depreciation would not necessarily result in improvements in the CA.

This also implicitly recognizes that the developments in a small economy would mostly influence its own CA and
REER.

In 2015 the construction of the Husab uranium mine and the expansion of the port will begin, while the Tschudi
copper project will continue. The planned investment for 2015 of these projects is estimated at 5.8 percent of GDP,
resulting in a temporary increase of imports.

Annex III. Debt Sustainability Analysis
Though Namibia’s public debt level remains low, continuous rise in public debt and increasingly high
gross financing needs raise concerns. The main risk to the public debt outlook stems from possible
delays in fiscal consolidation, the SACU revenue shock and rollover risks due to larger reliance on
short-term domestic debt. The profile of external debt appears robust to interest rate shock, although
the external debt trajectory indicates vulnerability to exchange rate depreciation and reduction in
current transfer from South Africa.

A.

Background

1.
Namibia’s public debt (including public guarantees) remains low, although it has
risen significantly since the global financial crisis in 2008-09. The debt roughly doubled in
nominal terms since the crisis, rising from 18.9 percent of GDP in 2009/10 to an estimated 26.8
percent of GDP by 2013/14.
2.
The composition of public debt bears little exchange rate risk given its reliance on
debt denominated in Namibian dollar or in South African rand. Most of the Namibian public
debt is denominated in local currency, and the share of domestic debt is about 70 percent of total
public debt in 2013/14. Treasury bonds account for around 58 percent of the government’s
domestic debt, while treasury bills (issued in tenors of 91, 182, 273, and 365 days) make up the
balance of domestic debt.
3.
The publicly guaranteed debt significantly increased in recent years, threatening the
compliance with the government’s debt guarantee target. For long, the Namibian authorities
have respected implicit ceilings on public debt (below 35 percent of GDP) and publicly guaranteed
debt (below 10 percent of GDP) to limit the accumulation of public and publicly guaranteed debt
under the sustainable level. However, under the current medium-term expenditure framework
(MTEF), the publicly guaranteed debt is expected to rise above the guaranteed debt target as the
authorities plan to provide guarantees for financing large capital projects (including the Kudu-gas
project, the Walvis Bay port facilities, and the national fuel storage facility).
4.
Namibia has been diversifying the external borrowing portfolio with enhancing access
to the international bond market. It issued two sovereign bonds; namely the US-dollar
denominated Eurobond of US$500 million in October 2011, and the R850 million South African
Rand denominated bond on the Johannesburg stock Exchange in November 2012, both with 10years tenure. Recently, the 5 year bond (R800 million, denominated in Rand) was issued on the
Johannesburg stock exchange in June 2015. Three sovereign bonds occupy the large share of the
existing external debt portfolio, followed by multilateral and bilateral loans for the rest.

Medium Term Public DSA

5.
A heat map suggests that the country faces risks relating to its gross financing needs
(Figure 1). Under the baseline scenario, the gross financing needs would temporarily exceed the
policy benchmark of 15 percent of GDP in 2016/17. All standard macro-fiscal shocks would raise the
gross financing needs further, and the SACU revenue shock creates additional financing needs.
6.
Under the baseline scenario (consistent with the macroeconomic framework
underlying the 2015 Article IV Staff Report), the public debt would stay modest over the
medium term, although the fast pace of debt accumulation and the projected increase in
gross financing needs raise concerns (Figure 3 and 4). The public and publicly guaranteed (PPG)
debt―expected to stay below the debt distress threshold (60 percent)―would grow fast from 27
percent of GDP in 2014/15 to 46 percent by 2019/20. Due to widening fiscal deficit in 2016/17, the
gross financing needs are expected to increase to about 15 percent of GDP before gradually falling
down over the medium term.
7.
The macro-fiscal stress tests demonstrate the rapid rise in the public debt-to-GDP ratio
under the SACU revenue shock and the combined shock scenario, but the debt stock remains
below the indicative policy threshold of 60 percent. Two additional stress tests are conducted in
Figure 5: the contingent liability shock and the SACU revenue shock. The contingent liability shock
scenario (assuming temporary increase in non-interest expenditure to recapitalize banks, equivalent
to 5 percent of the current size of banking system asset) demonstrates that the debt level will
remain below the threshold level of 60 percent of GDP. The SACU revenue shock scenario (assuming
reduction in revenue by 5 percent of GDP, real GDP growth by 2 percent in 2016/17 and 2017/18,
combined and a rise in interest rate by 50 basis points) show that the level of debt distress could be
elevated but remain below the threshold level even when the economy is hit much harder than the
baseline scenario due to the SACU revenue shock.
8.
Under the tighter fiscal policy scenario (reform scenario), the public debt-to-GDP ratio
and the gross financing needs would trend down after 2016. With stepped-up fiscal
consolidation efforts over the medium term, fiscal surplus is envisaged for 2019/20, while the public
debt-to-GDP ratio would remain below the authorities’ own debt ceiling of 35 percent.

C.

Medium Term External DSA

9.
Namibia’s gross external debt is gradually increasing but remains at moderate level.
Under the baseline scenario, Namibia’s external debt is projected to gradually increase up to about
50 percent of GDP (Table 1). Deterioration in current account due to smaller SACU receipts from
South Africa and lowering commodity prices contribute to an increase in the external debt ratio.
Private external debt accounted for around 80 percent of total external debt in 2013.
10.
The sensitivity tests suggest that Namibia’s external debt-to-GDP ratio is particularly
sensitive to a current account shock and real depreciation shock. Standardized sensitivity
analysis suggests that Namibia’s external debt is resilient to interest rate and growth shocks, but a

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

43

NAMIBIA

30 percent real depreciation in 2015 would raise the external debt-to-GDP ratio to 66 percent in
2019 as most of private external debt is denominated in foreign currency.1 Assuming that a current
account deficit be 3.5 percent of GDP (one-half standard deviations) larger than projected in the
baseline during 2015-19, the external debt-to-GDP ratio would increase to 67 percent of GDP by
2019.

D.

Conclusion

11.
Overall, high gross financing needs and the fast pace of debt accumulation raise
concerns, and a tighter fiscal policy stance (as envisaged under the reform scenario) would
ensure debt sustainability over the medium term. With expected decline in SACU revenues and
widening fiscal deficits, gross financing needs would rise further in coming years under the baseline
scenario. While both public debt and external debt would stay within the range of moderate debt
distress under the baseline scenario, the stress tests demonstrate that the debt dynamics could raise
a concern for debt sustainability, if Namibia should fail to implement fiscal consolidation as planned,
and/or if the SACU revenue is lower than projected under the baseline scenario. The external debt is
also not resilient to unexpected rise in current account deficit and exchange rate depreciation.
Shifting toward a tighter fiscal policy stance, along the lines envisaged under the reform scenario, is
critical to ensure debt sustainability over the medium-term.

1

As about 90 percent of the loans are at fixed interest rate, the external debt does not appear to be particularly
sensitive to the real interest rate shock.

1/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms, g = real GDP growth rate,
e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels
of the last projection year.

Nature/source of main risks

Likelihood of realization in the next
three years

Expected impact on economy if risk is
realized

Protracted period of slower growth in
key advanced and emerging economies

HIGH (Euro area and Japan)

MEDIUM





Euro area and Japan: Weak demand
and persistently low inflation from a
failure to fully address crisis legacies
and appropriately calibrate macro
policies, leading to “new mediocre”
rate of growth.
Emerging markets: Maturing of the
cycle, misallocation of investment,
and incomplete structural reforms
leading to prolonged slower growth.

Tighter or more volatile global financial
conditions

MEDIUM (Emerging markets)
• Protracted slower growth in Europe
would adversely affect sugar exports
(one of Namibia’s key export items) to
Europe.
• Protracted slower growth in South
Africa could lower South Africa’s imports,
weaken demand for Namibia’s exports,
and further lower SACU revenues.

• External balances would deteriorate with lower
SACU revenues and weaker import demands
from Europe and Namibia’s neighboring
countries. Economic growth would also be
affected.

1

• Step up structural reforms to
promote private sector development.
• Diversify export markets.
• Build sufficient international buffer,
through fiscal consolidation and
external financing.

HIGH

HIGH

• As a result of the expected FED’s liftoff,
prices of risky assets could drop abruptly,
as investors reassess underlying risk and
move into safe assets, including the
dollar.

• The central bank might be forced to
substantially increase interest rates in line with
the South African policy rates.

• Obtain additional external financing
(denominated in rand) to avoid a sharp
deterioration in international reserves

• Lower financial flows could significantly worsen
the external balance

• Implement fiscal consolidation by
reducing recurrent expenditures and
enhancing revenue mobilization.

• Reduced growth and higher debt service costs
could slow down the fiscal consolidation.

Adjustment of house prices in Namibia

Possible Policy Response

MEDIUM

HIGH

• Hose prices in Namibia grew fast for
several years, potentially deviating from
economic fundamentals. Shocks, such as
an interest rate hike, could lower demand
and force price adjustments.

• With increase in nonperforming loans,
commercial banks’ capital would be eroded,
raising macroprudential concerns. Growth would
also be adversely affected.

• Improve the efficiency of public
spending by strengthening PFM and
enhancing public sector reforms.
• Monitor the systemic risks and
implement targeted macroprudential
policies.

Based on the latest G-RAM. The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The
relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability
between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability of 30 percent or more). The RAM reflects staff views at the time of the PCM.

The Namibian dollar is pegged to the South African rand. Namibia accepted the obligations of
Article VIII, Section 2, 3, and 4 of the Fund’s Article of Agreement, as of September 20, 1996.
Namibia is currently judged by the Fund to maintain an exchange system free or restrictions on the
making of payments and transfer for current international transactions.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance. The authorities provide core monthly
data to the Fund with a lag of one to two months, except for the national accounts and international
trade data, which are reported quarterly and annually with longer lags. The authorities completed
the 2009/10 National Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) which allowed the reestimated of the Gini coefficients. The Namibia Statistics Agency (NSA) was recently transformed
into a fully autonomous agency in order to enhance the government’s capacity to collect and
compile high quality statistics.
National Accounts: The authorities have rebased the base year of the national accounts to 2010.
Quarterly national accounts (QNA) estimates, at constant prices are disseminated on the NSA’s
website, though there is a need to improve the existing source data. Plans by NSA to produce
current price QNA are progressing. The NSA is assessing the integration of VAT data in the national
accounts compilation framework. The National Accounts are produced bi-annually and revised for
the latest three years. Major revisions for back years such as correcting of errors and altering the
economic structure to reflect current economic situations is filtered in but at longer intervals.
Price Statistics: The base year for the consumer price index is 2012. This index provides an
adequate presentation of the spending patterns of the citizens and their experience of inflation. The
CPI weights, introduced in the December 2012 index, are derived primarily from the Namibia
Statistics Agency’s 2009/10 Household Income and Expenditure Survey. Data on the labor market,
including labor force, employment, and wages are only collected on an annual basis (the latest
annual labor force survey is for 2014). Assisted by the AFRITAC South, the NSA launched a project
for development of Producer price index (PPI). According to the project framework, the first
preliminary results are expected in the first quarter of 2016.
Government Finance Statistics: Annual budgetary central government data by fiscal year; which
are reported on a cash basis in the GFSM 2001 format, are reasonably complete, despite some lack
of details. No fiscal statistics are compiled for extra budgetary institutions, consolidated central
government, or consolidated general government.
Monetary and Finance Statistics: Monthly monetary statistics for the Bank of Namibia (BoN) and
the other depository corporations (ODCs) are reported on a regular basis, although there is room to
improve the timeliness of reporting, particularly with regard to BoN data. Beginning in April 2002,
data are based on standardized report forms, which accord with the concepts and definition of the
Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual.
Balance of Payment and International Investment Position Statistics and External Debt: Since
2001, the BoN has been reporting the balance of payments data on a quarterly basis with a lag of
one quarter. The data is subject to substantial revisions. The methodology underlying the balance of
payments is consistent with the fifth edition of the IMF’s Balance of Payment Manual. There is room
to improve the compilation of the BOP statistics most notably to lower the large errors and
omissions. The international investment position (IIP) data are compiled quarterly with a lag of one
quarter. The BoN has focused its work to improve the compilation of capital and financial
transaction and IIP statistics. However, further work is needed to expand the coverage of the IIP and
make it compatible with the balance of payments statistics.

II. Data Standards and Quality
Namibia has participated in the GDDS since late 2002. A ROSC (Data Module) was published in 2002
and updated in 2005.
III. Reporting to STA
The MOF reports on a regular basis annual data for publication in the Government Finance Statistics
Yearbook. Work on establishing monthly reporting of high frequency data is still in progress.
The BoN reports monetary and financial statistics to STA regularly. Balance of payments and
international investment position data are published in International Financial Statistics (IFS) and in
the Balance of Payments Yearbook.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION
Prepared by

African Department

1. This supplement provides information that became available since the issuance
of the staff report on September 2, 2015. The Namibia Statistics Agency released on
September 9 updated national accounts, with significant upward revisions for growth in
2013 and 2014.1 This information does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2. Namibia’s real GDP growth was revised up to 6.4% from 4.5% for 2014 and to
5.7% for 2013. The revision was mostly

3. The GDP revision implies only minor changes in key macroeconomic ratios.
Although real growth rates were increased, the deflator was revised downwards. Overall,
Namibia’s nominal GDP level for 2014 was lowered by 3.2 percent. As a result of the
lower denominator, the 2014 debt-to-GDP ratio becomes 28.1 percent of GDP (rather
than 27.2 percent), and the fiscal deficit is 3.9 percent of GDP (compared with
3.8 percent). On the external side, the 2014 current account deficit becomes 10.3 percent
of GDP (instead of 9.9 percent).

1

Given fewer data sources for the preliminary estimates, they are often subject to wide revision. The authorities are
working jointly with AFRITAC South to enhance statistical capacity.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Statement by Ms. Kapwepwe, Executive Director for Namibia,
and Ms. Dlamini-Kunene, Advisor to the Executive Director for Namibia
September 18, 2015
My authorities appreciated the candid and productive engagement during the Article IV
consultation and are broadly in agreement with the analytical thrust of the reports. They
share similar assessments and concerns, especially on the outlook and risks to the fiscal
and financial sectors. It is on this basis that authorities have already commenced halfyearly reviews of the budget and the medium-term expenditure outlook.
My authorities’ execution of sound macroeconomic policies coupled with a focused
development agenda has supported economic growth and augured well for
macroeconomic stability and growth. These efforts have borne fruit; Namibia attained
upper middle income status and has made significant achievements in improving the
welfare of the people of Namibia through better access to health, potable water, education
and financial services. Despite the positive developments made thus far, challenges
remain including housing pressures, unemployment and income inequality. In this regard,
they are committed to pursuing policies that will help alleviate these socioeconomic
challenges, while safeguarding macroeconomic stability.
Recent economic developments and outlook
The revised full national statistics data released on September 10, 2015 indicate that the
economy, supported by strong construction activity and wholesale and retail trade, GDP
grew by 6.4 percent in 2014 from 5.7 percent in 2013. This number is higher than the
April 2015 preliminary estimate of 4.5 percent indicating stronger than anticipated
growth in the secondary and tertiary sectors which account for 17.7 percent of GDP and
57.7 percent of GDP respectively.
Buoyant construction activity and a recovery in the utilities sector contributed to the
strong performance in the secondary sector, while wholesale and retail trade, transport
and communication and education sectors were the major contributors to the strong
growth in the tertiary sector. Mining activity on the other hand performed poorly, due to
decreases in uranium and other mining and quarrying activity.
Inflationary pressures remained benign despite the exchange rate depreciation. Annual
inflation rate averaged 5.4 percent in 2014, having fallen from 5.6 percent in 2013 due to
transportation cost, a consequent of lower oil prices and a tighter monetary policy stance.
The annual inflation rate continued to slow down on average during the first half of 2015.
However, annual inflation rose to 3.3 percent in July 2015 from 3.0 percent in June 2015.
Inflation is expected to rise slightly but remain within manageable levels.
The current account deficit continued to narrow to N$580 million during the first quarter
of 2015, compared to the previous quarter (N$1.1 billion) and corresponding quarter of
2014 (N$3.3 billion). The narrowed deficit was primarily due to a lower merchandise
trade deficit, decreased outflows in investment income and sustained high current

transfers. As a percentage of GDP, current account deficit reduced to 0.4 percent in the
first quarter of 2015. The stock of international reserves rose substantially by 20.2
percent to N$14.8 billion during the second quarter of 2015 compared to the previous
quarter, mainly due to the issuance of a new JSE bond worth N$800 million. The
favorable exchange rate also supported the positive developments in international
reserves.
The economic outlook is positive with the anticipation of a recovery in global demand
and new mines coming on stream. Real GDP growth is expected to increase on account
of continued robust construction activity, an expected increase in mining production and
activities in the wholesale and retail trade. However there are important downside risks,
in particular the falling commodity prices, slow recovery in the country’s main trading
partner economies and adverse weather conditions. Furthermore, the projected decrease
in SACU receipts is expected to negatively affect the economy and public finances.
Fiscal and debt policies
Fiscal policy remains accommodative in line with the authorities’ objective to support
economic growth and job creation. The authorities are still committed to their
consolidation objective that they announced in 2012 evidenced by the winding down as
scheduled in 2013/14 budget, the Targeted Intervention Program for Employment and
Economic Growth (TIPEEG) launched three years earlier. Strong revenue mobilization,
higher SACU receipts and low debt allowed the authorities to increase spending,
especially on infrastructure, goods and services and wages.
However, going forward, the projected fall in SACU receipts will exert pressure on fiscal
revenues and negatively impact gross official reserves. In this respect, the authorities will
pursue a fiscal consolidation path that is in line with fiscal and debt sustainability. They
have already implemented cuts on recurrent spending such as travel and other related
costs and these cuts will continue into the medium term. Further expenditure recalibration
will entail postponement of non-priority and least productive capital spending associated
with public administration infrastructure.
The public debt policy is underpinned by the country’s 2005 Sovereign Debt
Management Strategy which sets out fiscal limits. Though public debt has risen in the
past few years, it remains low and sustainable. This is a consequence of the authorities’
prudent management of public debt and a conservative benchmark of 35 percent of GDP.
Monetary and exchange rate policies
The Bank of Namibia pursed a tighter monetary policy stance in 2014, in response to the
acceleration in credit extension and rising property prices. Consequently, credit extended
to the private sector has slowed, due to decreased demand by the corporate and household
sectors for overdraft, mortgage and other loans and advances.

On the exchange rate policy, the authorities continue to view the exchange rate peg to the
South African rand as an appropriate monetary policy anchor. They recognize that if
gross official international reserves’ continue to decline will compromise the credibility
of the peg. At present, the stock of international reserves is 3.9 times higher than the
currency in circulation therefore adequate to maintain the peg between the Namibia dollar
and the rand. Going forward, the authorities will continue to safeguard the peg and build
adequate buffers to buttress the economy’s defenses against potential external shocks. In
this regard, they are considering other options and a fiscal consolidation path that will
boost the level of reserves in the medium-term.
Financial sector policies
The banking sector remained sound, profitable and adequately capitalized. Asset quality
improved as shown by the decrease in the non-performing loans (NPL) ratio during
second half of 2014. However, the banking sector remains highly leveraged in the
mortgage sector. The rapid increase in credit extension experienced in previous years,
especially to the mortgage sector along with the rising household indebtedness have
created vulnerabilities in the financial system. The possible threat to financial sector
stability is a concern for the authorities. Given that the rapid growth in housing prices has
been fueled to a larger extent by supply constraints, the authorities are considering
options to speed up the process to facilitate the supply of serviced land. Additionally, the
authorities appreciate staff’s analysis of the macro-prudential risks in the selected issues
paper and they concur on the need to consider macro prudential measures to curb
speculative behavior. Nonetheless, going forward the banking sector’s financial condition
is expected to remain sound and healthy.
Structural reforms
My authorities recognize that Namibia’s success has raised the aspirations and
expectations of Namibians which, makes urgent the need for them to ensure that the
economic benefits are shared by the broader population. In this regard, they will continue
to promote employment creation through economic diversification. To address youth
unemployment they will promote development of functional technical skill through
increased access to tertiary and vocational training.
Conclusion
My Namibian authorities are committed to pursuing sound macroeconomic policies and
implementing structural reforms to ensure more inclusive economic growth, address the
high level of unemployment and reduce vulnerabilities while locking in the progress they
have made so far to promote inclusion and accelerate convergence with SADC targets.
They will continue to pursue a fiscal consolidation path that will restore and preserve
medium to long-term fiscal sustainability.
