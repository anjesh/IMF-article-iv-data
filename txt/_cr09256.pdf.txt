Staff Report for the 2009 Article IV Consultation
and Request for a Three-Year Arrangement Under the

Prepared by the African Department
(in consultation with other departments)
Approved by Michael Atingi-Ego and Dominique Desruelle
June 30, 2009
Discussions. Discussions for the 2009 Article IV consultation and on the authorities’ request
for a PRGF arrangement were held in Accra during May 11–22, 2009. The staff team
comprised Messrs. Allum (head), Erasmus, Kovanen (all AFR), Jarmuzek (SPR) and
Ms. Lukonga (MCM). The mission was supported by Mr. McIntyre (resident representative);
Mr. Kwakye, Advisor to the Executive Director for Ghana, joined the discussions. The staff
met with Minister of Finance Duffuor, Bank of Ghana Governor Acquah, other senior
officials, and representatives of parliament, labor unions, the private sector, NGOs, and the
donor community. The mission liaised closely with the World Bank. A press release was
issued at the end of the mission.
PRGF arrangement. The Ghanaian authorities request a three-year PRGF arrangement with
access of 105 percent of quota (SDR 387.45 million). This supports a program of fiscal
consolidation to tackle macroeconomic instability, which is currently the main obstacle to
sustained strong growth and poverty reduction. A broad agenda of structural reforms will
strengthen fiscal institutions ahead of the start of oil production in 2011.
Exchange regime. Ghana maintains a floating exchange rate regime and an exchange system
free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY


Highly expansionary fiscal policy destabilized the economy in 2008. With the fiscal deficit
rising to 14.5 percent of GDP, inflation rose to 20 percent, the currency depreciated by 50 percent
against the dollar, and official reserves fell to 2 months’ import cover.



The 2009 budget seeks fiscal consolidation. With expenditure restraint and higher grants, the
budget targets a 9.4 percent of GDP deficit. Cash management and expenditure monitoring have
been strengthened, and priorities for tax policy and revenue management have been identified.



The mission reviewed the economic outlook and the new government’s program. Ghana
appears likely to fare better than many countries during the 2009 global recession, reflecting an
improved terms of trade and limited banking, manufacturing, or other exposures. The staff were
more pessimistic about growth than the authorities, forecasting an expansion of 4½ percent in
2009, rising to 5 percent in 2010.



Review of the 2009 budget outlook showed a projected deficit over-run. Based on the staff’s
growth forecast and other updates, the fiscal deficit was projected at 10.4 percent of GDP, on
unchanged policies. The government have cut tax exemptions, identified wage savings, and are
adopting a temporary profit tax surcharge to meet the original deficit target. They also stand ready
to tighten spending further in the event of unexpected shortfalls in growth and revenues.



Further fiscal measures of about 3½ percent of GDP will be needed in the 2010 budget.
Utility prices will likely need to rise to offset rising power generation costs, and revenue
mobilization options should be explored.



The inflation targeting framework will need to be robust in 2009-10. Despite a tighter fiscal
stance, inflation expectations are high, reinforced by continuing currency depreciation. With real
interest rates only moderately positive and resumed strength in global oil prices, there is a strong
case for further monetary policy tightening.



Exchange rate flexibility should be maintained. A large depreciation against the dollar has
translated into only modest correction in the real exchange rate. The authorities see the currency
as appropriately valued, while staff see risks of continuing modest overvaluation. Given possible
needs for further correction, tight monetary policy would help limit the inflation pass-through.



The financial sector has been resilient to the initial impact of the global financial crisis. But
risks have accumulated in an environment of rapid banking expansion, strong competition, and
increased risk taking. A recent deterioration in loan books could continue, based on rising funding
costs and currency depreciation. This is mitigated by steps to increase minimum capital.



The authorities have requested a PRGF with access of 105 percent of quota. It would support
a program focused on multi-year fiscal consolidation and public debt stabilization. Key fiscal
institutions (both revenue and expenditure management) would be strengthened ahead of the start
of oil production in 2011. Staff supports this request.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Ghana completed a Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF)
arrangement in October 2006. Under the PRGF, it achieved strong growth, single-digit
inflation, major debt reduction, 1 and a decline in the poverty rate from 39 percent (1998–99)
to 28 percent (2005–06); other social welfare indicators also improved. Fiscal stability was
elusive, however, with the deficit rising sharply by end-2006.
2.
Discussions in 2007–08 on a program to be supported by the Policy Support
Instrument (PSI) did not advance. Responsiveness to the Fund’s 2008 surveillance advice
on fiscal management was also limited (Box 1). The most fruitful areas of collaboration in
2007–08 centered on Fund staff advice on building access to global financial markets and
developing the framework for an inflation targeting regime.
Box 1. Ghana: Response to Fund Advice
Fiscal policy: A central message of the 2008 Article IV consultation concluded by the Board on
June 30, 2008 was the urgency of fiscal tightening to avoid deteriorating debt dynamics and risks
to external sustainability. In practice, a highly expansionary fiscal stance was maintained through
the end-2008 elections, with large over-runs in public sector wages.
Monetary and exchange rate policy: In line with Fund advice, the Bank of Ghana continued to
tighten monetary policy through the second half of 2008 and into early-2009. However, given the
expansionary fiscal stance, this was not sufficiently aggressive to stem inflation. On exchange rate
policy, the greater flexibility in the exchange rate since mid-2008 was in line with Fund advice.
Structural reforms: Little progress was made in 2008 on macro-critical reforms to public
financial management (PFM) and the civil service.

3.
The macroeconomic dialogue has strengthened under the new government. At
the authorities’ request, a staff team visited Accra in February 2009 to support preparatory
work for the 2009 budget (adopted in March), and technical assistance was requested on tax
policy, revenue administration, and natural resource taxation (with missions completed in
April–June).
4.
The authorities have requested a new PRGF arrangement. This will underpin
fiscal consolidation and a program of structural fiscal reforms ahead of Ghana’s move to oil
producer status starting in 2011 (Section IV).

II. BACKGROUND
5.
Economic growth rose to a two-decade high of 7.3 percent in 2008. This reflected
expansionary fiscal policies combined with an upswing in private sector activity based on
strong credit expansion, buoyant remittances, and strong agricultural yields. For 2009,
growth is projected to slow, based on policy tightening and spillovers from the global
recession.
6.
Inflation has risen on account of external shocks and strong domestic demand.
After falling briefly to single-digits in 2006, inflation rose through 2007–08, reflecting global
food and fuel price shocks, strong domestic demand, and the pass through from currency
depreciation. In early-2009, inflation stabilized in the 20 percent range. With easing demand
pressures, inflation is projected to decline to 14½ percent by end-2009.
7.
Presidential and parliamentary elections were a factor behind fiscal slippages in
2008. The fiscal deficit surged to 14.5 percent of GDP, reflecting rapid public spending
growth, with capital spending, energy subsidies, and wage and salaries each rising by more
than 1 percentage point of GDP. Following earlier power shortages, new investments were
made in thermal power capacity; large subsidies were incurred when electricity tariffs were
not adjusted to reflect the rising cost of power generation; and public sector salaries were
increased, on average, by more than 30 percent (15 percent in real terms). The 2008 fiscal
deficit drew on exceptional foreign financing amounting to 7.3 percent of GDP, comprising
resources from the late-2007 Eurobond issue and proceeds from the sale of Ghana Telecom. 2
In addition, the central bank provided financing equivalent to more than 3 percent of GDP.
8.
The 2009 budget targets a deficit of 9.4 percent of GDP, largely based on
spending cuts and higher grant receipts. Following the completion of power sector and
other investments, capital spending has been cut by 3 percent of GDP (Text Table 1). Energy
sector subsidies are also projected to decline by more than 1 percent of GDP, in line with
global oil prices. These savings are partly offset, however, by higher interest costs and a
larger provision for clearing domestic arrears. Updated fiscal projections developed during
the May mission suggested a potential deficit overrun of 1 percent of GDP. To maintain the
2009 deficit target the authorities have cut tax exemptions, identified wage bill and
investment savings, and are adopting a temporary increase in the profit tax for selected
industries (MEFP, ¶24).

The US$750 million yield from issuing a debut Eurobond in late-2007 was largely spent in 2008.

9.
Monetary policy was tightened in response to rising inflation. The Bank of Ghana
increased its benchmark lending rate by 6 percentage points between October 2007 and
February 2009, and market conditions tightened by more, as reflected in interbank and
treasury bill rates. The policy rate was left unchanged in May 2009 on an assessment that
inflationary pressures were easing. Despite rate increases, the real prime rate has been
negative since early-2008 (based on backward-looking inflation), while the real interbank
rate remains in the 0-2 percent range. The banking sector has continued to register strong
asset growth, with private sector credit up 56 percent in the year to April 2009, only partly
due to valuation changes on foreign currency-denominated loans. This expansion continues
to reflect local deposit mobilization, with broad money up 28 percent on the same basis.

Ghana’s overall financial system remains stable. The regulatory and supervisory
framework is strong, backed by a modern payment and settlement infrastructure. Financial
Soundness Indicators (FSIs) point to a banking system that is liquid and with capital above
statutory levels. However, some recent deterioration is evident: non-performing assets are
high and rising (9.6 percent in March 2009); profitability is declining; and a few banks are
financially strained. The Bank of Ghana has required banks to raise their minimum capital to
GHȼ60 million (about $40 million) to allow them to play a larger role in the rapidly growing
economy. 3 The non-banking sector (insurance, pensions and capital markets) has continued
to perform well.
11.
Ghana’s external current account deficit widened to 19 percent of GDP in 2008,
up from 12 percent of GDP a year earlier. This largely reflected a 33 percent increase in
non-oil imports values, driven by strong domestic demand. Financing was provided through
an increased external capital account surplus, buoyed by Ghana Telecom privatization
proceeds (5½ percent of GDP), and a draw-down of gross international reserves from
US$2.8 billion to US$2.0 billion. Reflecting the latter, gross reserve cover declined from
2.7 to 2.2 months of projected import cover.
12.
Exchange rate flexibility has increased since mid-2008. Reflecting Ghana’s
macroeconomic imbalances and declining foreign exchange inflows, the exchange rate
depreciated about 50 percent against the dollar during 2008 and the first half of 2009. Much
of this adjustment was offset, however, by Ghana’s high inflation rate and the appreciation of
the dollar in the context of the global financial crisis. Accordingly, the real effective
exchange rate in April 2009 was just 8 percent more depreciated than in 2007. Over the
recent period, illiquidity in the foreign currency market has been associated with a decline in
interbank trading and a widening of spreads.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Growth Prospects and Risks
Discussions focused on the uncertain growth outlook, where staff are less optimistic than the
authorities, and see downside risks. In 2011, the start of oil production will boost growth and
government revenues, but create new challenges for macroeconomic management.
13.
Growth prospects for 2009–10 are particularly uncertain, reflecting divergent
influences. On the positive side, Ghana is benefiting from a terms of trade improvement
projected at 20 percent in 2009, as cocoa and gold prices remain buoyant while oil import
costs have declined. In addition, credit growth remains strong and favorable rainfall trends

are expected to continue to benefit hydroelectricity and agricultural production. Given these
factors, the authorities envisage only a modest slowdown, to a little under 6 percent in 2009.
By contrast, the mission expects fiscal tightening to be a significant drag on growth in 2009.
In addition, credit growth is projected to slow, and the global recession is having an impact
through the remittances channel, with first quarter inflows down 18 percent on a year earlier.
On this basis, the mission projected growth of 4½ percent in 2009, consistent with a
composite indicator series compiled by the Bank of Ghana (Figure below). For 2010, the
mission projected growth of 5 percent, based on an improving external environment. While
viewing the staff’s forecast as overly pessimistic, the authorities agreed to use it for fiscal
planning (Section III.B).

From 2011, Ghana will benefit from the start of oil production. The proven
reserves are relatively modest at present, with the offshore Jubilee field estimated at
490 million barrels. 4 However, test results from other fields are favorable, and reserves could
rise to 1.5 billion barrels or more (matching Chad and the Republic of Congo). Production
from the Jubilee field is planned to start in 2011, with peak production over an initial
5-6 years, followed by a progressive decline. Initial production is projected at about
17 percent of non-oil GDP, with more than one third accruing to government revenues
(6-7 percent of GDP in 2011–12). Oil production would largely substitute for oil imports,
except in 2011-15, when an exportable surplus is projected (figure overleaf).

4

Pending more definitive information, no allowance has been made for potential gas exports from the Jubilee
field.

Macroeconomic management will need to be alert to the consequences of oil
production. The oil sector and related spending of oil revenues will boost demand pressures
starting in 2011. On the assumption that demand pressures are prudently managed, the
medium-term framework projects a return to robust non-oil growth in the 5-6 percent range,
and a decline in inflation to about 5 percent. A projected fiscal deficit of 4 percent on average
over the medium-term is projected to result in a small decline in the net debt-GDP ratio. The
external current account deficit would increase in 2010 due to oil-related infrastructure
imports, before declining over the medium term as oil exports come on stream
(Text Table 2).

Risks to growth are on the downside. Although Ghana is projected to achieve a
“soft landing”, spillovers from the global recession may prove larger than currently
projected, possibly through an intensified decline in remittances or a deterioration in gold or
cocoa prices. In addition, a shift by domestic banks to more cautious lending standards in the
context of rising non-performing loans could trigger a larger than expected slowdown in
private sector investment.
B. Policy Mix in 2009 and 2010
17.
The authorities’ policy framework seeks to reduce inflation while rebuilding the
external reserve position. Reserve and broad money growth are projected to slow to reduce
inflation to single-digit rates by end-2010 (Text Table 3). The decline in domestic credit
growth is more marked than for overall liquidity, releasing resources to rebuild Ghana’s
foreign currency reserve position. For 2009, the financial program aims to avoid further
losses in net international reserves from end-March levels, while the program for 2010
targets a modest reserve accumulation. The authorities and staff would have normally have
preferred a larger near-term reserve build-up, but the additional fiscal adjustment and
reduction in net domestic financing needed to accomplish this was not seen as realistic.

C. Strategy for Fiscal Consolidation
A highly expansionary fiscal stance has contributed to macroeconomic instability. Plans for
near-term fiscal consolidation need to be backed by a strategy for using oil wealth.
18.
Deficit reduction is the immediate macroeconomic priority. The authorities
recognize the destabilizing impact of the fiscal deficit: the 2008 outturn is comparable to
levels last seen in 1992–99, when inflation peaked at over 70 percent, and public debt rose
from under 50 percent to more than 110 percent of GDP. The planned deficit reduction to
4½ percent of GDP in 2011, and subsequently lower, will address inflationary pressures and
stem a renewed upturn in public debt.

12
19.
Fiscal measures in 2009 are being augmented to preserve the deficit target. The
mission welcomed the emphasis on spending restraint in 2009, which will partially reverse
the upward trend that contributed to the 2008 deficit. The prompt adoption of measures in
June to avoid over-runs in the fiscal deficit are also welcome (MEFP, ¶24). The authorities
have intensified cash management, and in the event of an even larger slowdown in economic
growth and revenue collections, are ready to maintain the deficit target through cuts in
discretionary spending.
20.
The 2010 budget will be challenging. The mission noted that fiscal measures of
about 3½ percent of GDP will be needed to achieve the 6 percent deficit target for 2010
(see Table 2A). On current estimates, this target could largely be achieved by expenditure
restraint, including in the public wage bill, combined with higher utility prices to address a
projected power sector shortfall. 5 In practice, however, the authorities will also need to
explore options to strengthen revenue mobilization. The fiscal gap is likely to be larger than
currently estimated, reflecting the potential need to clear remaining arrears from 2008
(MEFP, ¶53). Equally, the projected compression of the wage bill in 2010 may not be
feasible, given the planned salary structure reform, and the squeeze on capital spending may
not be sustainable, given emerging infrastructure needs.
21.
Ghana maintains a broad social safety net program. Current protection for the
most vulnerable include subsidized electricity tariffs (up to a maximum monthly usage), a
cash transfers to qualifying households, school feeding, free maternal health care, grants and
subsidies for basic education, and a national youth employment program. The authorities
plan to expand cash transfers for qualifying households, provide free school uniforms to
children in deprived communities, and free books for pupils in basic public schools. Staff
welcomed these measures, which should safeguard low-income groups from fiscal
tightening.
22.
At the same time, the authorities intend to re-examine budget flexibility. The
growth of mandatory and similarly-protected spending commitments limits the space for
fiscal maneuver. With a rising wage bill, an expansion of health care transfers in 2007, and
the majority of capital spending protected from annual budget review (in the form of trust
funds with earmarked financing), the inflexible element of the annual budget has risen from
92 percent of revenues and grants in 2006 to 107 percent in 2009 (Text Table 4). Staff
recognized the case for reviewing funding arrangements for capital spending, providing that
poverty-reducing programs retain appropriate protection.

5

The fiscal projections reflect unchanged utility tariffs. Based on the global oil price outlook, a depreciating
currency, and a projected shift from hydro to more costly thermal power generation, operating shortfalls of the
power authority are projected at nearly 3 percent of GDP in 2010. The government’s commitment to adopting
cost-recovery utility tariffs by end-2009 will therefore be critical for supporting the 2010 budget (MEFP, ¶52).

23.
A medium-term fiscal strategy is needed, integrating the potential revenues from
the oil and gas sector. The authorities provisionally plan to use oil incomes in 2011-12 to
finance infrastructure projects; these investments would then be scaled back in subsequent
years, to allow part of oil revenues to be saved in a “heritage fund” to support public
programs as oil revenues decline. The mission supported a front-loaded investment strategy,
given Ghana’s infrastructure needs, while cautioning that spending should be based on
cautious oil revenue assumptions and take into account the country’s absorptive capacity.
Firm control will be needed over recurrent spending, to ensure that it does not expand to fill
the newly available fiscal space. Equally, oil receipts should not be at the expense of
strengthened non-oil revenue mobilization; the latter will be needed if donor support were to
decline following Ghana’s move to oil producer status. The mission noted that these
considerations should be reflected in a fiscal rule for managing oil revenues, a topic to be
revisited after the June 2009 technical assistance mission on resource sector taxation. The
mission welcomed the authorities intention to ensure that the oil accounts are fully and
transparently integrated into the fiscal accounts, and the plan to extend Ghana’s EITI
participation to the oil sector (MEFP, ¶38). 6
24.
The joint Bank-Fund external debt sustainability analysis (DSA) suggests that
Ghana’s external debt dynamics remain subject to moderate risk of debt distress. This
assessment is broadly unchanged from the 2008 DSA, though the baseline debt trajectory is
more favorable, reflecting the incorporation into the baseline of the Ghana’s projected move
to oil producer status in 2011. Assuming successful fiscal consolidation and sustained robust
growth in the non-mineral economy, net public debt is projected to decline by about
35 percentage points of GDP during 2010-2029, to about 37 percent of GDP (or slightly
below the post-HIPC/MDRI debt-GDP ratio in 2006). Stress tests suggest that external debt

6

EITI would also be extended to forestry and fishing.

14
indicators remain generally resilient to less favorable outcomes, while sustainability of the
overall net debt position depends critically on maintaining a strong primary fiscal position.
D. Monetary, Exchange Rate, and Financial Sector Policies
To stem the inflationary impact of currency depreciation and higher fuel prices, monetary
policy may need to be tightened further. Banking risks have risen, and supervisors will need
to be alert to emerging strains.
Monetary policy
25.
Discussions focused on the factors contributing to rising inflation under the IT
framework. The required elements of an IT regime are in place (Box 2). The mission noted,
however, that IT peer countries were typically more aggressive in monetary tightening than
Ghana during 2007-08. The authorities noted that inflation in these countries also exceeded
target levels, owing to the global food and fuel price shocks. More crucially, in Ghana’s case,
monetary tightening was overwhelmed by highly expansionary fiscal policies. With an end to
fiscal dominance, the Bank of Ghana views its tools for monetary management as adequate
for controlling inflation. Based on evidence of tightening credit conditions and easing
demand pressures, the central bank projects a decline in inflation to 14½ percent at end-2009,
reaching single-digits in 2010.
26.
The case for further monetary tightening has strengthened since the mission. In
May, staff saw little scope for near-term easing, given the modest level of real interest rates
and the vulnerability of inflation expectations to further currency depreciation. Indeed, the
mission cautioned that further tightening might be needed to achieve the central bank’s
disinflation goal. This argument has been subsequently reinforced by the 30 percent rise in
domestic petroleum product prices in early-June, based on rising global oil prices. Further
tightening would help resist second-round inflationary pressures. The authorities indicated a
readiness to consider a tighter monetary stance in the July MPC meeting, should conditions
warrant.

15
Box 2: Ghana’s Inflation-Targeting Framework
The Bank of Ghana (BoG) formally launched its inflation targeting (IT) regime in 2007, and has
benefited from advice from, among others, the Bank of England and Fund staff. The framework
targets the 12-month change in the headline CPI, and the BoG also monitors a number of core
inflation measures.
The key institutional arrangements for an IT framework are in place, including central bank policy
independence, instrument independence, bi-monthly meetings of a Monetary Policy Committee
(MPC), and generally good transparency.
BoG staff produce a range of inflation forecasts for the MPC, using a range of macro models
(from simple autoregressive to relatively up-to-date multiple-equation time series models); they
also track surveys of inflation expectations. Efforts continue to strengthen the models—for
example, to identify a robust link between the fiscal stance and inflation. Real sector data are
limited (no monthly production or quarterly GDP data), but the BoG has developed a quarterly
composite indicator that tracks GDP trends moderately well (paragraph 13).
The BoG has the operational tools to influence inflationary pressures through credit market
conditions. The commercial bank lending rate has closely tracked the BoG prime rate and, more
recently, has responded to conditions in the interbank and t-bill markets, which the BoG
influences through open market operations.
In the view of staff, the next developmental phase for Ghana’s IT regime is to gain greater comfort
in basing policies on the available analytical tools. For example, in February 2009, the BoG’s
quarterly macro model suggested that interest rates would need to rise significantly by the end of
the second quarter to counter inflationary expectations. In practice, the policy rate was increased
150 basis points in February, and not subsequently (Figure below).

27.
To enhance the IT framework, the authorities intend to strengthen
communication (MEFP, ¶58). The mission suggested that greater clarity was needed about
the monetary transmission mechanism and Bank of Ghana’s policy stance. The authorities

16
concurred with staff that a renewed emphasis on communications was needed, including
through revamping the central bank website and clarifying its preferred measure of core
inflation. The authorities disagreed that more frequent Monetary Policy Committee meetings
would be helpful, noting that data limitations preclude a substantial reassessment of the
policy stance more often than bi-monthly.
Exchange rate policy
28.
The authorities intend to maintain a flexible exchange rate regime consistent
with the inflation-targeting framework (MEFP, ¶59). They envisage that policy tightening,
combined with new external funding, will help stabilize the currency, a necessary condition
for successful disinflation. It was agreed that the Bank of Ghana should refrain from
intervention in the foreign exchange market, other than through its regular weekly sales of
foreign exchange to meet priority demands (e.g., debt service and oil import costs).
Consistent with Ghana’s low official reserve cover, the authorities intend to use the possible
new SDR allocation to rebuild foreign exchange reserves (MEFP, ¶28). Looking further
ahead, the mission suggested that the authorities should aim to develop the role of the private
sector in the foreign exchange market to handle the increased turnover that will emerge with
the start of oil production.
29.
The recent currency depreciation may have partly corrected for earlier
overvaluation. Staff analysis suggests that the real effective exchange rate in the first quarter
of 2009 may have remained modestly overvalued (Box 3). In the event of further currency
pressure, the mission urged tight monetary conditions to limit any inflationary pass-through.
The authorities noted that the staff’s currency valuation analysis produced mixed results,
including some that suggested undervaluation. They interpreted these findings as consistent
with their view that the currency was broadly appropriately valued.
Financial sector issues
30.
Discussions focused on the impact of the global crisis on Ghana’s financial
system and the prospective risks. An in-depth assessment by Fund staff was generally
positive about supervisory capacity in Ghana, but noted that banking sector risks were rising
(Box 4). The mission discussed how to limit spillovers from the global financial crisis and
how to strengthen governance and board oversight in state-owned banks. The authorities
indicated that a program to address these risks was being rolled out (MEFP, ¶61).

17
Box 3. Ghana: Exchange Rate Assessment
As noted in paragraph 12, the large depreciation of the cedi-dollar exchange rate since mid-2008
was offset, in large part, by high inflation and the strength of the dollar. With Ghana’s real
effective exchange rate in early 2009 remaining stronger than in 2003–04 (figure below), a
currency valuation exercise was conducted to assess whether further real effective adjustment is
warranted.
Analytical approaches based on developments in the external current account tend to suggest
currency overvaluation. The underlying current account deficit after eliminating temporary
influences is estimated at 11.5 percent of GDP in 2008, well above the norm of 8.7 percent of
GDP derived through the macro-balance approach. It is also larger than the net foreign liabilitystabilizing current account deficit of 9.8 percent of GDP implied by the external sustainability
approach. To reduce the external deficit to the latter range, a real effective depreciation of 7–12
percent would be needed.
Approaches that model the real exchange rate directly suggest potential currency undervaluation.
Econometric analysis drawing on Ghanaian and cross-country data suggests that the recent
currency appreciation can be explained by Ghana’s faster output growth (Balassa-Samuelson
effects) and positive terms of trade changes. These econometric approaches suggest that the real
effective exchange rate could be undervalued by 31–39 percent.
Fund staff tend to discount these econometric findings, given the fragility of the estimation results.
In particular, the findings are very sensitive to the estimation time period and the explanatory
variables included. Until more robust estimates can be developed, more weight has been given to
signs of possible modest overvaluation coming from Ghana’s widening current account deficit.

Box 4. Challenges for Ghana’s Financial System
The direct impact of the global financial crisis on Ghana’s financial system has been relatively limited. This reflects
Ghanaian banks’ limited integration with global markets and their reliance on domestic funding. Credit markets remain
buoyant, and financial institutions are generally stable. In the debt markets, some foreign investors have exited from
government securities, spreads on the international bond have increased, and options for new sovereign issues have narrowed.
Domestic inflationary pressures and declining foreign inflows have contributed to higher interest rates in domestic money
markets and pressures in the foreign exchange market.
Strong banking sector expansion has created vulnerabilities. Despite strengthened supervision, an environment of rapid
financial growth, intense competition, and rising funding costs has encouraged risk taking. Banks’ loan portfolios are often
concentrated on a few large borrowers or sectors; some foreign currency loans are to unhedged borrowers; and rapid growth
of domestic branch networks against a background of rapidly expanding cross border operations by parent banks has
increased potential for strategic and operational risk. Some banks’ internal controls and risk management practices have been
stretched. The ratio of non-performing loans have risen to a year high of 9.6 percent at end-March 2009, with above average
NPLs in the forestry, mining, and construction sectors (see below); a couple of banks have also incurred substantial losses
from their expansion strategy. Weaknesses in corporate governance and board oversight are also evident in some of the stateowned banks, with one recently experiencing apparent high-level fraud. Banks have begun to limit their risk exposure,
tightening lending standards. But this may not be enough to avoid a further deterioration in loan books.

Gaps in cross border supervision and in the financial infrastructure add to the risks. Some of the home supervisors of
parent banks do not undertake consolidated supervision, thus there is no oversight of group risks. In some cases, parent banks
are registered in jurisdictions where supervisory oversight is weak, prudential regulations lax and banking systems are
exhibiting some stress. Though progress has been made in improving the environment for creditor rights, banks continue to
experience difficulties in foreclosing on collateral. Also, credit risk assessment of borrowers is made difficult by weaknesses
in accounting and auditing practices in SMEs and the credit registry is just being established.
The Bank of Ghana has a well established framework that enables it to monitor risks in the financial system and to
respond to financial system stress in a timely manner. These include an established off-site framework for monitoring
risks supported by a well-developed stress testing framework. A Lender of Last Resort facility is available, and the BoG has
the legal authority to facilitate prompt corrective actions. Notwithstanding this, the operational framework for providing
liquidity support is limited in scope, both in the tenors of the loans that can be advanced and in the range of acceptable
securities, which could prove limiting under lengthy adverse conditions. There are also no deposit insurance or contingency
cross-border crisis arrangements.

19

E. Other Issues
31.
National accounts statistics. The mission discussed the outcome of a recent Fund
review of Ghana’s national accounts rebasing exercise, which suggests that economic activity
has been significantly under-estimated, reflecting outdated methodology and lapses in
incorporating new source data. Upward revisions could be as large as 50 percent, paralleling
revisions observed in other countries’ rebasing exercises (see Figure 1).
IV. THE NEW PRGF ARRANGEMENT
A.

Program Objectives and Design

32.
The PRGF-supported program builds on Ghana’s second Poverty Reduction Strategy
(GPRS II). 7 The arrangement will cover the three-year period from Board approval. Proposed
access is 105 percent of quota (SDR 387.45 million), somewhat above the norm for a fifthtime PRGF-user (70 percent of quota), reflecting program strength and balance of payments
need. The arrangement has eight disbursements (Table 8), with some front loading into
2009–10 when the adjustment effort and balance of payments need are strongest.
33.
The main goal of the program is to eliminate Ghana’s large fiscal imbalances by 2011
and put in place strengthened institutions for public financial management (PFM). Restoring
macroeconomic stability will eliminate the most pressing obstacle to continued strong growth
and poverty reduction. At the same time, fiscal consolidation will create the necessary room
for maneuver, so that when oil revenues come on stream in 2011, they can be dedicated to
new growth-promoting and poverty-reducing investments that benefit future generations,
rather than being diverted to unproductive recurrent spending. To support macroeconomic
stabilization, the inflation targeting regime will be further strengthened, notably in the critical
area of communications and transparency. Policy transparency would be underpinned by
extending the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI) to the oil sector
(MEFP, ¶38), and by expanded publication of fiscal data (MEFP, ¶67).
B. Program Monitoring
34.
The program will be initially monitored on a quarterly basis, given the near-term risks
from the global recession. The first two reviews would assess developments relative to
performance criteria for end-September and end-December 2009. Subsequently, program
monitoring would move to a semi-annual basis, with tests dates for end-June and endDecember through 2011, and a final review based on a test date of end-March 2012.
Quantitative targets would be as described below and in MEFP Table 1.
7

Work to develop an updated GPRS III to cover the period starting 2010 has been initiated (MEFP, ¶56). A
status report will be provided at the time of the first review.

20


Fiscal performance would be assessed by the overall balance including grants. Given
the need for spending restraint, adjusters would limit the scope for new spending
commitments in response to higher-than-programmed grant or loan funding.
Shortfalls in financing would be partially covered by spending cuts, and partly by
higher resort to domestic financing, up to a ceiling (TMU, ¶22).



Debt sustainability would be promoted by limiting nonconcessional financing to
high-return infrastructure and energy projects. The program would provide for
guarantees for Ghana National Petroleum Company borrowing for oil and gas
investments of up to US$300 million during 2009–10 (MEFP, ¶54).



Monetary policy will be subject to review clauses linked to inflation ranges around
the target disinflation path. To underpin the IT framework, net domestic assets of the
Bank of Ghana will be an indicative target.
C. Structural Conditionality

35.
Structural conditionality focuses on strengthening fiscal institutions (tax policy,
revenue administration, PFM) and addressing recurrent sources of spending pressure
(particularly energy subsidies and the public sector wage bill) (MEFP, Table 2).
36.
Tax policy. Ghana has the essential pillars of a modern tax system, but two features
erode revenue potential and hinder economic growth. The system is overwhelmed by special,
often discretionary, exemptions that undermine confidence in the equity and effectiveness of
the tax regime. Thresholds for VAT and business taxation are also too low, leading to
wasteful use of scarce administrative resources on small taxpayers. Steps taken in June 2009
to rein in exemptions will be intensified in the 2010 budget (MEFP, ¶24, ¶32). To simplify
VAT administration, a review will also be conducted this year to reduce the number of zerorated VAT items and convert domestic zero-rating to standard rate taxation (MEFP, ¶32).
VAT thresholds and small business taxation will also be revisited (MEFP, ¶33).
37.
Revenue administration. Ghana, formerly in the vanguard of revenue administration
reform, has lagged behind best practice in recent years. In particular, international experience
has shown the circa-1980s model of a semi-autonomous revenue service under a governing
board to be less effective than the single revenue authority model, under which customs and
tax administration are managed by a single executive and benefit from information and other
synergies. Further, the separate agencies for income tax and VAT administrations have
proven inefficient and costly, and therefore Ghana would benefit from the experience of most
other countries by moving towards a single integrated domestic tax agency within the
intended revenue authority. The authorities intend to launch a modernization strategy with
these goals by end-2009 (MEFP, ¶35).
38.
Public expenditure management. Roll out of Ghana’s integrated financial
management information system (IFMIS) has stalled at the pilot stage, and institutional

21
capacity for tracking and controlling spending has been weak, giving rise to reoccurring
domestic arrears. The government intends to review by end-2009 the shortcomings of the
existing IFMIS system, and develop a plan for its wider adoption or for a move to an
alternative system (MEFP, ¶42). In the interim, intensified monitoring, supported by
strengthened inter-agency coordination, is being adopted to manage the budget through 2009
(MEFP, ¶40–41). The authorities are also taking stock of the outstanding claims from 2008,
and will adopt policies to avoid new arrears in the future (MEFP, ¶53).
39.
Public sector reform. A comprehensive public sector modernization program is
needed, addressing the size, effectiveness, and remuneration system of the public service.
The World Bank will support this reform program. In the near-term, the Fund program aims
at strengthening monitoring and control of the payroll numbers through comprehensive
computerization of staffing data, centralized hiring procedures, payroll audits, and the launch
of a rationalization process for public agencies (MEFP, ¶45-49).
40.
Energy sector reforms. In the past, under-pricing of electricity supplies and
petroleum products has required government subsidies, undermined the financial
accountability of the state-owned enterprises, and left a legacy of cross-debts and arrears.
The World Bank is supporting a financial restructuring and recovery program for the sector.
The PRGF is designed to ensure the adoption and maintenance of cost-recovery pricing
(MEFP, ¶52). A key condition will be the adjustment of electricity to cover operating costs
from end-2009, with cost-recovery maintained through subsequent quarterly reviews.
D. Program Financing
41.
Even with policy adjustment, Ghana faces balance of payments financing gaps of
US$450 million in 2009 and $325 million in 2010.


The fiscal financing gap is projected at US$250 million in 2009, declining to half that
size in 2010. The majority of the gap would be closed in 2009 through a new World
Bank Development Policy Loan, which would augment its 2009 funding pipeline by
US$200 million. Ghana is a candidate for a new vulnerability facility being
developed by the European Commission, which could close up to half of the
remaining gap. The authorities have approached other bilateral donors, including the
African Development Bank, and expect to close most, if not all, of any remaining gap
for 2009. Donors have noted that while additional financing for 2009 has been
difficult to mobilize in the context of established multi-year support agreements, the
PRGF arrangement would provide the macroeconomic assurances necessary to
maintain existing support levels as programs come up for review. The authorities
have indicated that any residual financing shortfall would be met through a
combination of further spending restraint and some limited additional use of domestic
financing (TMU, ¶22).

22


Further balance of payments financing of $200 million in 2009 and 2010 would be
provided under the PRGF arrangement. This would stabilize gross reserve levels at
2 months import cover, a level that would rise to 2½ months’ cover with the proposed
new SDR allocation. The balance of payments financing need assumes that private
capital inflows remain low through 2009-10, except for oil sector investments in
imported rig equipment. Net private remittances are also projected to decline
30 percent in 2009, with limited recovery before 2011.
E. Program Risks and Mitigation

42.
Program monitoring should be vigilant. The authorities will need to monitor
activity and revenue collections closely to ensure that contingency plans for spending
restraint can be activated, if needed, to safeguard the fiscal position.
43.
Strong communications will also be key. Adjustments to utility pricing to achieve
the fiscal deficit target for 2010 will be an important challenge, especially if global oil prices
continue to rise. To support this core element of the program, public outreach will be
important. Looking further ahead, it will be important to convince interest groups that the
momentum of reforms should be sustained after the start of oil production. Although oil
revenues will bring the 2011 deficit target within reach, this should not be at the expense of
revenue mobilization in the non-oil economy and should not delay steps to rationalize public
administration. Without these continuing reforms, recurrent spending programs could expand
to absorb the new fiscal space created by Ghana’s oil wealth.
44.
Ghana has adequate capacity to meet its financial obligations to the Fund. The
country has an established record of timely servicing its obligations to the Fund, and the DSA
places Ghana at a moderate risk of debt distress (paragraph 24). Debt service to the Fund
would remain modest in absolute terms, and below 1 percent of exports of goods and services
by the end of the program period.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
45.
Ghana’s current challenges reflect economic mismanagement, exacerbated by
global factors. The pursuit of highly expansionary fiscal policies through 2008 despite
growing signs of macroeconomic imbalance contributed to high rates of inflation, rising
interest rates, and currency pressures. Macroeconomic correction has been complicated by
the global financial crisis, which closed off global market funding options and required resort
to exceptional financing from development partners.
46.
The external environment remains more favorable than for many countries.
Ghana’s terms of trade have strengthened during the global recession, supporting incomes
and growth, while the domestic financial system has proved to be relatively insulated from
the global financial storm. Given this, while projections are more than usually uncertain,
growth is projected to exceed the global average through 2009–10. There are important risks,

23
however, notably to private sector remittances and foreign direct investment. Equally, the
terms of trade benefit has declined with the recovery in oil prices. If private sector activity
slows sharply, the challenges for macroeconomic management would be complicated.
47.
Fiscal consolidation will be central to restoring macroeconomic stability. The
deficit target for 2009 is appropriately ambitious, and the focus on expenditure restraint is
welcome. Contingency plans for further expenditure tightening will be important to keep the
deficit on track in the event of revenue shortfalls. Further fiscal measures will be needed to
reduce the deficit to 6 percent of GDP in 2010. An increase in utility tariffs will be needed to
cover the rising costs of power generation. Steps to control public wage growth should be
pursued, along with options for strengthened revenue mobilization. Even after a significant
fiscal consolidation, however, Ghana’s medium-term prospects remain subject to important
challenges, including the need to reduce public sector debt to more sustainable levels.
48.
Revenues from the start of oil production in 2011 will create important new
fiscal space. Part should be used to further reduce the fiscal deficit and accumulate assets for
the post-oil period, while part could finance an expansion of infrastructure spending after two
relatively tight years in 2009–10. However, oil revenues will be modest relative to many
producers, and the production period is expected to be relatively short. Given this, every
effort should be made to avoid complacency about the fiscal outlook from 2011. Continuing
efforts will be needed to strengthen domestic revenue mobilization, including to safeguard
against a potential phasing out of donor grants, and expenditure policies should continue to
seek improved value for money in public services. Structural fiscal reforms will be critical to
enhance fiscal management, including in the rapidly-approaching oil era.
49.
With tighter fiscal policies, the onus for inflation control now falls squarely on
the IT framework. With rising global oil prices and an associated large increase in domestic
petroleum product prices, the case for further monetary policy tightening is strong. To
reinforce the IT framework, clearer communications are needed about the policy framework
and monetary stance.
50.
Despite currency depreciation, the real effective exchange rate remains relatively
appreciated. With some risks that the currency remains slightly overvalued, continued
exchange rate flexibility will be important.
51.
Risks in the banking system will require careful monitoring. Surveillance should
be strengthened, and commercial banks encouraged to reinforce risk management and
corporate governance practices. Gaps in cross border supervision require stepped up regional
collaboration. Domestically, enforcement of creditor rights should be further strengthened,
and further momentum given to the operations of the credit reference bureau. Staff welcomes
the authorities’ interest in an FSAP update.
52.
Statistical data should be further strengthened for surveillance purposes.
Improved data on the national accounts are a priority.

24
53.
Staff supports the authorities’ request for a new PRGF arrangement. The focus
of the new program on fiscal consolidation and supporting structural fiscal reforms is
appropriate. Progress is needed on a range of fronts to regain a vanguard position in public
finance management. Reforms are likely to be resisted by pressure groups, particularly as oil
production approaches. However, without reform, Ghana risks dissipating its oil revenues
with little long-term benefit for growth and poverty reduction. An active communication
strategy will be critical to sustaining the momentum of reform.
54.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Ghana take place within
24 months, in accordance with the decision on consultation cycles in program countries.

APPENDIX I—LETTER OF INTENT
June 26, 2009
Mr. Dominique Strauss-Kahn
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, DC 20431
Dear Mr. Strauss-Kahn:
After another peaceful, democratic and competitive election in Ghana in December 2008, a
new government of the National Democratic Congress Party took over power in January
2009. The Government sees its political mandate as an opportunity to manage the economy
to achieve prosperity for all Ghanaians.
While the country achieved significant gains in the macroeconomic and social areas through
2005, the last three years were characterized by severe imbalances brought on by external
shocks that were compounded by expansionary domestic policies.
The new government is committed to addressing the economic imbalances, re-stabilizing the
economy, and placing it on a path of sustained high growth in order to accelerate the pace of
progress toward the Millennium Development Goals and middle income status for Ghana.
The attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) reviews recent
economic developments and policies, and outlines adjustment and reform policies intended
under the program. In support of the policies in the MEFP, the government requests that the
Executive Board of the IMF approve a Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF)
arrangement with access in the amount of SDR 387.45 million (105 percent of quota).
The Government of Ghana will provide such information as the Fund may request in
connection with progress in implementing its economic and financial policies. The
government believes that the policies set out in the attached MEFP are adequate to achieve
the objectives of its program, but it will take any further measures that may become
appropriate for this purpose. The Government will consult with the Fund on the adoption of
these measures, and in advance of revisions to the policies contained in the MEFP, in
accordance with the Fund’s policies on such consultations.

38

Sincerely yours,

/s/

Dr. Kwabena Duffuor
Minister of Finance and
Economic Planning

Dr. Paul A. Acquah
Governor
Bank of Ghana

APPENDIX I—ATTACHMENT I
MEMORANDUM OF ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES, 2009-12
I. Introduction
1.
The Government of Ghana has adopted a comprehensive program of macroeconomic
stabilization and reform. This memorandum sets out Ghana’s economic and financial policies
for the period July 2009-June 2012, to be supported by the International Monetary Fund
under a three-year PRGF arrangement.
2.
Ghana successfully went through a keenly contested presidential and parliamentary
elections in December 2008. A clear winner emerged after two rounds of balloting in the
presidential elections with a slim majority. There was, subsequently, a smooth handover of
power from the New Patriotic Party to the National Democratic Congress, the second such
transfer since Ghana ushered in multi-party democratic governance in 1992. This outcome is
a manifestation of the consolidation of the democratic gains, making Ghana a strong
functioning democracy in Africa, and stands as the single most remarkable achievement in
the country’s governance history.
Recent economic and social achievements
3.
Real GDP growth increased steadily from 3.7 percent in 2000 to 7.3 percent in 2008.
This growth was fostered by significant debt relief which provided the country with fiscal
space to embark on critical infrastructure investments, particularly in the energy and road
sectors, as well as targeted social spending, all under the Ghana Poverty Reduction Strategy
(GPRS). The combination of higher output growth, declining inflation, and improved social
spending under the GPRS framework contributed significantly to lower poverty levels. The
national incidence of poverty declined from 39.5 percent in 1998/99 to 28.5 percent in
2005/06. At this rate, Ghana is poised to achieve the Millennium Development Goal (MDG)
of halving extreme poverty ahead of 2015.
4.
In the education sector, gross enrolment ratios have increased. A major initiative for
improved enrolment ratios was the abolition of mandatory school fees for basic education
and the introduction of capitation grants in the 2005–06 academic year.
5.
In the health sector, there have been progressive improvements in the delivery of a
number of important outputs. Most notable are: increase in life expectancy from 55 years in
2003 to 57.9 in 2006; the introduction of a pre-paid National Health Insurance Scheme in
2004; and the introduction of free maternal care for expectant mothers. These, together, have
put healthcare within the reach of the poor and vulnerable groups.

40

6.
Gender disparities are gradually declining in some areas of service provision, such as
in primary education, where the country has almost achieved gender parity. Recent estimates
suggest that gross enrolment ratios have been higher for girls than for boys putting Ghana on
track to achieve MDG 3 (gender parity in primary enrolment).
7.
The improved macroeconomic environment during the period paved the way for
Ghana to make a debut on the international capital markets in October 2007, raising
US$750 million as additional capital targeted at infrastructural development for growth,
especially in the key area of energy.
8.
In the financial sector, important structural and institutional reforms have also been
undertaken recently. In particular, a comprehensive legal and regulatory framework and
strengthened risked-based prudential supervision policies have been put in place to further
deepen the financial sector and safeguard the safety and soundness of the financial system.
Macroeconomic stress during 2007–08
9.
In spite of the progress in the macroeconomic and structural areas, the economy has
come under severe stress since 2006. The macroeconomic situation deteriorated sharply on
the back of both domestic and external shocks. In 2006–07, Ghana suffered a severe energy
crisis as a result of severe drought, leading to a significant shift from a predominant hydro to
thermal power generation at a time of rising crude oil prices, with adverse impacts on the
economy.
10.
The global food and fuel price increases in 2007–08 adversely impacted most subSaharan African countries, including Ghana. In the context of these global shocks and the
2008 elections, public sector spending increased substantially, raising the fiscal deficit from
7.5 percent of GDP in 2006 to 14.5 percent of GDP in 2008. Contributing to the strong fiscal
expansion were high energy-related subsidies, increased infrastructure investment, higher
wages and salaries, and a rise in social mitigation expenditures to dampen the effects of the
global price shocks.
11.
The global financial crisis has contributed to further balance of payments pressures.
While export proceeds have not, thus far, been significantly impacted, private remittances are
slowing, there has been some outflow of portfolio investments, and the outlook for foreign
direct investment is not encouraging. Official access to global market financing is now
extremely limited. This has reinforced the urgency of macroeconomic adjustment and efforts
to identify new external financing from development partners.
12.
Strong public spending growth, combined with rapid credit expansion and rising oil
import costs contributed to a widening of the external current account deficit from
9.9 percent of GDP in 2006 to 19.3 percent of GDP in 2008. In 2008, the overall balance of

41

payments recorded a deficit of US$941 million compared with a surplus of US$413 million
in 2007 (inclusive of the balances on sovereign bond proceeds). The 2008 deficit was mainly
financed by a drawdown of reserves, leading to a decline in the stock of gross international
reserves, by US$800 million to US$2,036 million at the end of 2008, equivalent to
2.2 months of import cover.
13.
Real GDP growth for 2008 remained strong at an estimated 7.3 percent, up from
5.7 percent in 2007. The pass through from higher global commodity price shocks, combined
with fiscal expansion, resulted in a rise in headline inflation from 12.7 percent in December
2007 to 18.1 per cent by end-2008. The Bank of Ghana responded by increasing the prime
rate by a cumulative 350 basis points in 2008, ending the year at 17 percent.
14.
Inflationary pressures have remained strong in the first four months of 2009, with
12-month inflation in the 20 percent range from January through April 2009. This reflects
sharp increases in some components of the non-food category of the inflation basket, mainly
as a result of sharp depreciation of the cedi against the major international currencies in the
first quarter. The prime rate was further increased by another 150 basis points to 18.5 percent
in February 2009, and the Bank of Ghana stands ready to tighten further as needed.
15.
The Ghana cedi weakened against the US dollar and the Euro following a surge in
demand for foreign exchange in 2008. In the interbank market, the Cedi depreciated by
38 percent against the US dollar. The larger than expected twin deficits of 2008, the
drawdown in reserves, and the uncertainties in the domestic and global financial markets
continued to weigh heavily on the Ghana cedi in the first quarter of 2009, with the cedi
registering a further 16 percent against the dollar through end-May.
16.
The banking system remains sound, well capitalized and fairly liquid. In 2008, the
sector witnessed a reduction in concentration, intensified competition and expansion in
branch networks.
II. The Government’s Economic Program
Medium-term objectives
17.
The Government is committed to pursuing measures that will ensure the attainment of
macroeconomic stability. The strategy will be accomplished through fiscal discipline that
hinges on prudent public expenditure management, enhanced domestic revenue mobilization,
adherence to public procurement rules, restructuring of the utility companies to reduce the
subsidy burden to the budget, public sector reforms, with particular emphasis on wage
reforms, and encouraging the private sector to participate in the accelerated growth agenda
through Public Private Partnerships (PPPs).

42

18.
To restore and consolidate fiscal and debt sustainability, the government intends to
reduce the fiscal deficit (excluding divestiture receipts) from 14.9 percent of GDP in 2008 to
9.4 percent in 2009, 6.0 percent in 2010, and to 4.5 percent in 2011. Further reduction is
planned beyond 2011. Deficit reduction will be driven, to the extent possible, by cuts in
low-priority public spending, with a view to reducing public expenditure in relation to GDP,
and shifting the balance from recurrent spending to infrastructure investments. Strengthened
revenue mobilization would aim to increase revenues in relation to GDP. Consistent with the
fiscal deficit targets, domestic financing of the budget would be reduced to low levels over
the medium term. This would free financial resources for private sector investments and job
creation.
19.
To help achieve the above fiscal goals, tax reforms and improved revenue
administration will enhance the revenue mobilization effort. There will also be decisive
measures to improve public expenditure management, enhance public financial management,
restructure state-owned enterprises (SOEs), in particular the utility companies, and ensure the
success of the public sector reforms.
20.
In line with the above policies, the macroeconomic goals for 2011 include real nonoil GDP growth of a little over 6 per cent; gross international reserves close to three months
of import cover; and stabilization of the total public debt relative to GDP, and with
subsequent reduction to reduce risks of debt distress over the medium term.
21.
Monetary policy will support the government’s fiscal consolidation efforts over the
medium term with a focus on stabilizing price and exchange rate expectations. Under the
inflation targeting (IT) framework, monetary policy will aim at achieving a medium term
inflation target of 7–9 percent within a forward looking time horizon of 18–24 months.
Macroeconomic program for 2009
22.
The government’s 2009 budget, approved in March 2009, was based on a growth
projection of 5.9 percent. Although the outlook for the global economy has subsequently
deteriorated, the government anticipates that Ghana will be somewhat insulated from the
global recession on account of buoyant prices for its two main exports, cocoa and gold, and
because of strong rain-based agricultural production. For fiscal prudence, the revenue
projections have been updated, to reflect revised nominal GDP estimates. The GDP deflator
figures, which are somewhat higher than earlier estimated, reflect inflation developments in
the first quarter. This is broadly offset by lower growth forecasts of 4.5 percent prepared by
Fund staff which recognizes downside risks to external demand and financing in the context
of the global recession. Based on these calculations the earlier budget revenue projections
have been largely retained. If growth and revenue collections over-perform, this may provide
scope to reduce the deficit below the budget target. At the same time, if growth and revenue
collections fall short, the government has contingency plans to maintain the deficit target

43

through cuts in discretionary spending, including by delaying non-critical investment
projects.
23.
The 2009 budget included a combination of expenditure savings and revenue
measures. On the expenditure side, cuts were made in spending on overseas travels,
workshops, and conferences; by reducing the number of Ministries from 27 to 23;
eliminating subsidies to the Volta River Authority (VRA) for oil imports; eliminating
transfers to the Bulk Oil Storage and Transport Company (BOST); delaying the contribution
to the West Africa Gas Pipeline Escrow Account until 2010; reducing non-developmental
capital spending; and by reallocating HIPC relief funds across programs to reflect the most
recent poverty-reduction priorities. On revenues, collections are being enhanced by
increasing the airport tax, road tolls, fees and charges, and by more effective application of
the communication service tax.
24.
Data through the first quarter of 2009 suggests that revenue and non-interest
expenditures are broadly on track. However, with treasury bill interest rates remaining high
through May 2009, interest costs are projected to exceed earlier estimates for 2009 as a
whole. To achieve the targeted fiscal deficit of 9.4 percent of GDP, additional fiscal savings
totaling 1.0 percent of GDP (GH¢ 209 million) have been identified. Specifically:
a)
The provision in the 2009 budget for wage structure reform (GH¢ 50 million)
has been eliminated, due to the postponement of reform to 2010 and later;
b)
The agreed 2009 salary increase for medical workers was lower than
budgeted, yielding savings of GH¢ 34 million;
c)
The 2009 allocation for domestic investment spending has been reduced by
GHc31 million, by delaying purchases of vehicles, office equipment, and other
miscellaneous items. Social protection programs, particularly in health, education,
and sanitation, will be preserved;
d)
Tax exemptions will be reduced, yielding projected savings of GH¢ 40
million. Effective June 17, 2009, special permits and general concessions will no
longer be available on a discretionary basis, and the Ghana Investment Promotion
Center will no longer have discretionary power to grant exemptions. These
exemptions would be available, in future, only with parliamentary approval, through
the Ministry of Finance.
e)
Customs and excise revenue collections are more buoyant than earlier
projected, and the 2009 revenue projection has been increased by GH¢ 43 million.

44

f)
The government is tabling legislation to establish a National Stabilization
Levy, comprising an additional 5 percent profit tax, effective through end-2010,
applicable to companies in the following sectors: banking, insurance, other financial
services, communications, mining, and brewing. The projected yield in 2009 is
GH¢11 million, with a full-year yield in 2010 of GH¢ 22 million or more.
25.
The government is confident that these measures will have a combined yield of at
least 1 percent of GDP. As noted above, the government has contingency plans to maintain
the deficit target through further cuts in discretionary spending, including by delaying noncritical investment projects, in the event of a fiscal shortfall.
26.
To further strengthen expenditure control, a temporary pause has also been imposed
on the issuance of commencement certificate for new investment projects, with on-going
projects subject to a review in order to prioritize them and better sequence their
implementation. The government also intends to review the cash management by earmarked
funds to identify potential unused resources, provided that this does not jeopardize povertyreducing expenditures.
27.
Based on potential domestic financing for the budget of 4.8 percent of GDP in 2009,
and updated projections for external disbursements, Ghana has a financing gap of
$250 million. This would be covered by a Development Policy Loan from the World Bank
which would augment planned World Bank support by $200 million in 2009, and by
exceptional budget support from development partners. In the event of a shortfall in foreign
program grant and loan financing, the government will offset this in part through spending
cuts and in part through increased resort to domestic financing, up to a maximum of
GH¢ 75 million (see details in the Technical Memorandum of Understanding).
28.
Fiscal tightening in 2009, combined with a tight monetary policy stance, is projected
to ease pressure on the balance of payments. With exceptional budget support and projected
Fund financing, gross international reserves are projected at slightly below two months of
import cover of goods and services at end-2009. To further strengthen Ghana’s international
reserves position, the authorities do not intend to draw on the proposed new SDR allocation.
29.
Ghana intends to maintain and strengthen its inflation targeting regime. The
disinflation process will be supported by fiscal consolidation, including as greater stability
returns to the foreign exchange market. For 2009, the Bank of Ghana will aim for a
progressive convergence on the medium-term inflation target range, with inflation projected
to decline to a 12-month rate of 14½ percent by end–2009.

45

III. The Structural Reform Agenda
Strengthening fiscal institutions
30.
Achieving success in the medium term will depend on strengthening fiscal
institutions and enhancing revenue mobilization and a strong public expenditure management
agenda. Key policy initiatives are summarized below.
Tax Policy and Tax Administration
31.
Ghana in the 1990s reformed its revenue administration and tax policy with some
success. It created new administrative structures, introduced the value-added tax, and made
changes to the personal income tax schedule in order to increase the incentives to work and
save. The corporate tax has been successively reduced from 35% to 25%. A decade and a
half later, the tax system is beginning to face new challenges emanating especially from ad
hoc changes to parent acts and the adoption of ad hoc exemptions and discretionary waivers.
Against this background, the government requested IMF technical assistance on tax policy
and revenue administration which was provided in April-May 2009. Their recommendations
will inform the new directions for Ghana’s tax system.
32.
Tax policy. The government is committed to streamline the tax legislation process so
that all legislation affecting the tax system is reviewed and tabled by the Ministry of Finance
and Economic Planning. As a first step, the government is committed to conduct reviews by
September to inform the 2010 Budget in the following areas:
a)
A review will be conducted of the nature and scope of tax exemptions and
discretionary waivers by sectors, beneficiaries, and their rationale, including those
related to any remaining firm-level customs tariff exemptions, with the objective of
phasing out unneeded tax holidays and other business incentives, and curtailing the
broad discretion given to other institutions;
b)
the number of zero-rated items (excluding exports) will be reviewed with the
goal of eliminating the zero-rating, or, if necessary, converting some to VAT
exemptions.
33.
Over the medium-term, to broaden the tax base and minimize distortions, reviews will
also be conducted on:
c)
the VAT regime, especially the threshold and refunds regime to strengthen the
effectiveness of the VAT;
d)

options to simplify the taxation of small businesses below the VAT threshold;

46

e)

the coverage of the VAT to the service sector; and

f)

the taxation of all investment income and the final taxation of dividends.

34.
The base of the income tax will also be broadened to cover the large potential
taxpayers in the private and informal sectors who currently are not paying any income tax.
The retention of internally generated funds by MDAs will also undergo serious review.
35.
Revenue administration. Ghana’s three tax revenue agencies operate independently,
share no activities and have very little exchange of information at the operational level. This
results in high compliance cost for tax payers, high administrative costs for government, and
high opportunities for tax evasion. The government intends to consolidate and centralize
management of the three agencies, with a specific objective to merge the VAT and income
tax services into a single, integrated tax administration. A modernization strategy for these
and other aspects of revenue administration is to be developed and approved by Cabinet
before end-2009.
36.
Efforts will also be directed towards closing the various leakages from the tax system.
Leakages have been associated with customs valuation and invoicing, transit goods, free zone
exemptions and bonded warehousing facility; VAT collection and payment to the
VAT office; and management of the withholding tax by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
Preventive services of the Customs, Excise and Preventive Service will be strengthened to
reduce smuggling and the abuse of the transit goods arrangement.
37.
Oil revenue management. Revenues from our oil production activities are expected
to come on board by 2011. Like all oil-producing economies, we are faced with a number of
challenges, including how much of the oil revenues should be saved, how to insulate fiscal
policy from fluctuations in oil prices, and how to protect the economy from possible
exchange rate appreciation (the so-called Dutch Disease). The goal is to ensure a cautious
phasing of petroleum revenues into the economy. This will be guided by the country’s
absorptive capacity, by the balance between how much to spend to accelerate growth and
reduce poverty, and by how much to save for the future.
38.
The government intends to continue with the national dialogue on the use of oil
revenues and with the ongoing work on the technical details of oil revenue management.
Work on a petroleum regulatory bill and an oil revenue management bill are ongoing and
will benefit from an IMF technical assistance mission scheduled for June 2009. Public
consultations on the allocation of petroleum revenues and on the guidelines for the
management of the funds will be held prior to legislation. In this area, the government
intends to ensure that oil revenues are fully and transparently included within the budget. To
further ensure the transparent treatment of oil and gas revenues, the government intends to

47

extend Ghana’s participation in the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI) to
cover this sector, as well as fishing.
39.
Enhancing Fiscal Responsibility. Recent experience suggests that maintaining fiscal
discipline remains a major challenge in fiscal management. As first step to instituting fiscal
responsibility laws, the government intends, in the short-term, to lay out some fiscal rules
that will strengthen fiscal discipline and help ensure desired fiscal policy outcomes. These
rules will also provide a solid institutional foundation for managing the oil revenues that are
projected to come on stream in 2011.
Expenditure management initiatives
40.
Although public financial management reforms have advanced in recent years,
continued expenditure slippages and budget over-runs expose weaknesses in the system.
Budgetary processes have improved over the years, but current developments indicate the
lack of adequate institutional and human capacity (a) to track expenditures at the budget
implementation stage and (b) to effectively manage commitments from the Ministries,
Departments and Agencies. The result is the inability to block unapproved spending at the
commitment stage, with risk of an over-run in commitments and emergence of domestic
arrears. The first step to addressing the problem is to strengthen Public Expenditure
Monitoring Unit (PEMU) in its human resources and in its processes of monitoring and
reporting of expenditure paths. Another important step is the establishment of a cash
management framework that will provide an early warning system for management.
41.
Cash Management. As part of the resolve to strengthen fiscal management, the
government has already adopted a strengthened cash management system involving the
Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning, the Bank of Ghana, and the Controller and
Accountant General. The three institutions have also initiated a process of developing a
Treasury Single Account (TSA) which brings all government accounts under a single
composite account structure. The TSA will allow for better cash flow management and better
planning of financing the public sector borrowing requirement. Revenue Management and
Expenditure Management Committees have been established to support the cash
management framework and the work of the EPCC.
42.
Budget management systems. To further strengthen the government’s capacity for
budget monitoring and control, it intends to press forward with plans for comprehensive
adoption of an integrated financial management information system (IFMIS). The existing
system has underperformed in the past due to technical factors, and has been rolled out to
only a limited number of ministries. Accordingly, this system will be reviewed with a view to
either developing a plan to address its shortcomings in advance of comprehensive adoption
or to lay the basis for moving to an alternative system. This review will be conducted by
end–December 2009.

48

43.
Other expenditure reforms. The efficiency of public spending will be enhanced by
re-introducing public expenditure tracking surveys; improving evaluation of investments and
projects and identifying programs that do not work, and for which less should be spent or
stopped altogether; strengthening performance orientation in the public sector through
effective implementation of performance management and development system (PMDS);
and strengthening the legal framework for public/private partnerships (PPPs).
Public Sector Reform and Payroll Management
44.
The heavy burden of the public sector wage bill remains a major concern. Between
2002 and 2008, wages absorbed an average of 44.5 percent of total tax revenue. This number
is expected to rise to 49.5 percent in 2009. The main objective of the reform is to strengthen
the link between public sector pay and productivity; maintain the competitiveness of public
sector incomes relative to the private sector; and determine the optimal number of employees
needed to efficiently deliver public services. The government intends to adopt a
comprehensive program of public sector reform, with the support of the World Bank.
45.
Payroll management. Incomplete automation has allowed Ministries, Departments,
and Agencies (MDAs) to significantly exceed approved hiring budgets. The government is
committed to strengthening the existing database management system for personnel and
payroll data of all public sector institutions. Sixty-five of the 114 agencies have migrated to
the new payroll database as at end of April 2009, though this accounts for just 4 percent of
the total staff strength of the subvented agencies. The government intends to migrate all
subvented agencies by end-September 2009. A committee would be established to monitor
progress of the migration exercise.
46.
Hiring controls. To contain the wage bill, the government has adopted a selective
hiring freeze under which new recruitment is principally in the education and health services.
At the same time, the validation of personnel into the centralized personnel database has been
strengthened to ensure that new recruits are consistent with budgetary provisions. This will
be comprehensive across the public sector including all subvented agencies by
end-September 2009.
47.
Payroll audits. An annual audit of the personnel database will be conducted by a
joint team of the Auditor General and the Internal Audit Agency. In addition, as an initial
exercise, a headcount of all staff of the Ghana Education Service will be conducted as part of
the efforts to ensure fiscal consolidation whilst improving the personnel database in the
sector. The headcount exercise is expected to be completed by end-September 2009.
48.
Subvented agency restructuring. Over the medium-term, a functional review of the
public service will be undertaken to provide an objective basis for a plan and schedule for
right-sizing. The restructuring of subvented agencies will be stepped up, and those that are no

49

longer relevant to the government’s objectives will be liquidated, while those that need to be
partially or fully commercialized will be instructed to do so within an agreed time frame.
Institutional responsibilities for this reform effort will be established by end-2009 with a
view to making good subsequent progress in auditing and restructuring the subvented
agencies.
49.
Pay reform. The government will ensure that discussions on a simplified “single
spine” public sector salary structure take account of affordability within the medium-term
wage and salary budget. Consistent with the government’s objective of ensuring that the
outcome of public pay negotiations informs the annual budget, the government intends to put
in place measures to complete such negotiations before the Budget is prepared and passed by
Parliament. It is, thus, expected that public sector salary and salary-related negotiations
would be completed by September before the budget is finalized and submitted to Parliament
in November.
Statutory Funds
50.
Another area of institutional policy reform has to do with the increasing rigidities in
the budget and the limiting effects on policy maneuvering. Current rigidities arise partly from
the existence of a number of statutory funds and committed expenditure items determined by
contracts and agreements with development partners. Excluding wages and salaries, the total
of these payments in the provisional budget outturn for 2008 was 48.5 per cent of total
payments, and for the 2009 the estimate is about 60 per cent. Government plans to review the
legal provisions and management of some of these statutory funds, with the view to
introducing some flexibilities and efficiencies in the overall fiscal management.
Energy sector reform
51.
Financial restructuring. The balance sheets of the majority of the state-owned
enterprises are under serious financial distress. Government plans to move speedily to ensure
that the Power Sector Financial Restructuring and Recovery Study commissioned in May
2008 is completed. This study will review of the financial status of all three power sector
utilities and propose a financial restructuring and recovery program that will ensure their
long-term viability. The study is expected to produce a comprehensive financial recovery
plan to improve upon financial operating ratios, reduce short-term indebtedness and reduce
arrears of each of the power utilities to suppliers and creditors. Additionally, the Plan will
clearly mark out VRA’s core and non-core assets, effect full transfer of national transmission
grid assets from VRA to GRIDCO and ring-fence assets and liabilities associated with GoGsponsored gas-turbine power projects.

50

52.
Energy subsidies. To address the cost of energy subsidies, the government intends to
(a) retain bi-weekly price adjustments for petroleum pricing, which are designed
to ensure cost recovery for the oil refinery and bulk importers; (b) adjust electricity pricing
by end-2009 to bring the average tariff to cost-recovery levels—that is, to a level that will
allow the VRA to cover, at a minimum, its operating costs without resort to government
subsidies, other than the lifeline subsidy for low-income consumers, which cost GH¢ 46
million in 2008 (0.3 percent of GDP); and (c) the electricity tariff structure will be subject to
quarterly reviews starting in 2010 to ensure continuing cost recovery.
Management of Domestic Arrears
53.
Provision has been made within the budget to settle in 2009 GH¢534 million of
domestic arrears carried over from 2008. MDAs have been required to report any other
potential domestic arrears from 2008 by end-September 2009, and a due diligence process
has been launched to validate reported liabilities. If the arrears from 2008 exceed the
amounts provided for in the budget, MDAs will be required to settle them, where possible,
within their 2009 budget ceilings. Where this is not possible, remaining amounts will be
addressed as a priority in the 2010 budget. At the same time, to avoid possible new arrears
pressures, all MDAs have been instructed to take steps to avoid over-commitments.
Debt Management
54.
To support the government's goals for debt and fiscal sustainability, the Government
will adopt a comprehensive public debt management strategy, providing a clear framework
for borrowing, establishing the principles that should guide the debt manager's decision
regarding the currency composition, maturity, interest rates and other risks of the debt
portfolio. Under this strategy the government intends to explore all avenues for concessional
financing, and will seek to avoid nonconcessional borrowing in foreign currency wherever
possible. In some cases, high-return infrastructure projects may require market-related
financing (such as for energy, road, and rail projects, and public private partnerships), and
may not be feasible without state guarantees. The government will evaluate these projects on
a case-by-case basis, based on economic rate of return, impact on debt sustainability, and
alternatives for achieving the same developmental goals. The government will provide to the
Fund a semi-annual listing of projects being considered for market-related foreign financing,
with a first report provided at the time of the first program review. On this basis, the
government would request that the limits under the PRGF arrangement imposed on

51

contracting or guaranteeing new external nonconcessional debt be set so as to accommodate
such projects. 1
Poverty reduction strategy
55.
To mitigate the risks associated with slower growth for low income and vulnerable
groups, the social protection and safety nets will be strengthened and expanded. Current
protection for the most vulnerable include “lifeline” scheme for utility costs, the Livelihood
Empowerment Against Poverty (LEAP) cash transfer program, school feeding program, and
free maternal care for almost 500,000 women. Others include grants and subsidies for basic
education, and national youth employment program. New initiatives include the provision of
school uniforms to about 1.6 million pupils in public basic schools in deprived communities
throughout the country. Free exercise books will also be provided for every pupil in all public
basic schools. In addition, the current capitation grant will be increased by 50 percent. In the
context of a move to full cost recovery utility pricing, a review will be conducted of the
possible need to expand support provided to poor households.
56.
The current Ghana Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS) covers the period through
end-2009. The government will shortly develop a strategy to extend the GPRS to 2010 and
beyond. This extended GPRS will underpin the government’s program of adjustment and
reform described in this memorandum.
IV. Monetary Policy, Exchange Rate Policy, and Financial Sector Issues
57.
One of the key aspects of BOG’s IT framework is to build confidence and anchor
expectations. The 2007–08 global financial crisis and its domestic pass-through effect seems
to have dislodged inflation and exchange rate expectations temporarily but the Central Bank
remains committed to the path of disinflation. In line with this, the BOG has recently
increased the prime rate by 150 basis points, to 18.5 percent. It is projected that inflationary
pressures will begin to ease by the second half of 2009, paving the way for reduction in the
policy rate. Policies will aim at reducing inflation below 10 percent during 2010.
58.
To strengthen the IT framework, the BOG will continue to build its forecasting and
analytical capacity to support monetary policy implementation, drawing on the experience of
other IT countries. The BOG will liaise closely with Fund staff in this area. In addition, the
1

During the coming year, the government has identified a potential need for debt guarantees during 2009-10 of
up to US$300 million to the Ghana National Petroleum Company (GNPC) to facilitate its participation in the
first phase of a program to exploit offshore gas deposits starting in 2011. The project would be commercially
viable, and is anticipated to involve majority private sector equity participation. Debt service would be financed
from gas sales to domestic or regional refineries, and risks to Ghana’s debt sustainability outlook would be low

52

communication strategy, which includes a press conference after each MPC, will be further
strengthened. The Bank of Ghana intends to restructure its website by end-year to consolidate
and give greater prominence to its inflation targeting policies and goals, and provide more
user-friendly access to MPC press releases, inflation reports, and other IT materials. This
transparency will help to reshape public expectations and in the process provide a forum for
greater accountability by the Bank of Ghana.
59.
The Bank of Ghana will continue to maintain a flexible exchange rate regime, with
foreign exchange market interventions limited to smoothing short-term fluctuations.
Financial supervision and regulation
60.
The Bank of Ghana launched a multi year program for risk-based supervision of
banks in 2007 which is supported by the Canadian Office of the Superintendent of Financial
Institutions (OSFI). It has set 2010 as the implementation year for BASEL II and in
collaboration with the banking industry, agreed to adopt the Standardized Approach for
credit risk and operational risk, and Standardized Measurement Method for market risk. An
updated Financial Sector Strategic Plan (FINSSPII), a blueprint for financial sector
development, will be completed during 2009, with implementation targeted to start in 2010.
61.
The Bank of Ghana is alert to the risks that weak governance structures and
inadequate risk monitoring systems can play in the banking system, including in state-owned
financial institutions. The Bank of Ghana is addressing risks in this area in the multi-year
banking supervision program. Banks have been required to appoint compliance officers; the
committee overseeing the BASEL II process meets quarterly to discuss risk management
policies; and the Bank of Ghana liaises more closely with external auditors in conducting
bank supervision to supplement information available from their written reports. Vigilance
has led to early Bank of Ghana intervention in some cases of problems inconsistent with
prudential regulations.
62.
To further extend the capacity of the banking system to play a key role in a rapidly
growing economy, the Bank of Ghana has increased the capital requirements of banks. The
Bank of Ghana has set the new minimum capital requirement at GH¢60 million to be met by
end of 2009. Banks with majority domestic shareholders however, are required to increase
their minimum capital to GH¢25 million by end 2010, and then to GH¢60 million by end
2012.
63.
Major financial sector reforms initiated recently and in the early stages of
implementation will be brought to full implementation during the program period. Notable
among these are (i) National Pensions Act, 2008 which will establish a regulatory framework
for a three-tier pension system; (ii) the Financial Services Bill, to provide the legal and
regulatory framework for providing nonbank financial services to non-residents; (iii) the full

53

blown establishment of the Financial Intelligence Centre under the Anti Money Laundering
Act., 2008; (iv) the Borrowers and Lenders Act; and (v) the Home Mortgage Finance Act.
64.
The reform of the domestic debt market is an important component of our efforts to
deepen financial markets and to improve the efficiency of the government’s debt operations.
Among the measures to be implemented in the medium term are a rationalization of the
primary dealer system, the annual publication of an issue calendar to guide portfolio
managers to plan an orderly rebalancing of their portfolios, and the implementation of a
comprehensive investor relations program targeted at both domestic and international
participants in the government debt market.
65.
Given the extensive changes in Ghana’s financial sector since the last Bank-Fund
Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) update, the government would welcome a new
FSAP update at the earliest possible opportunity.
V. Risks and Contingencies
66.
Key economic and financial downside risks to the program include lower-thanexpected remittances and private capital inflows, a more rapid than expected increase in
global oil prices, and a greater than anticipated economic slowdown in trading partner
countries. If these risks materialize, the government stands ready to adjust its policies, in
close consultation with IMF staff, to ensure the achievement of a sustainable external
position by the end of the program period.
VI. Data Provision and Program Monitoring
Statistics
67.
The following statistical data will be made available to the public as part of
information dissemination strategy of Government and to allow for transparency in
government operations:


National accounts. With technical assistance from the IMF, the National Accounts
numbers have been revised and rebased to 2004. The Ghana Statistical Service plans
to publish the new numbers by end December 2009. The GSS also plans to produce
quarterly national accounts after the publication of the new national accounts series.



Inflation data. Inflation (CPI) data will be announced by the 10th of the month
following the one that the outturn relates to. The Prime Building Cost Index (PBCI)
will be produced and disseminated quarterly. The Producer Price Index (PPI) will be
produced and disseminated with a month’s lag.

54



A population and housing census will be undertaken in 2010. Preparatory work has
started, and the census report is expected to be produced and disseminated starting
May 2011; and



Public finance data. The Controller and Accountant General will release the monthly
statement of the Final Accounts of government with a maximum of six weeks lag.
The Ministry of Finance will publish monthly fiscal outturns on its website with a
maximum lag of eight weeks, starting with the January to March 2009 accounts and
historic monthly data for 2008, which will be published by end-June 2009. Annual
data on the breakdown of public sector staff strength by MDA in 2008, together with
corresponding data on the aggregate wage bill by MDA will be published on the
Ministry’s website by end-September 2009, with estimates for 2009 and subsequent
years published within three months of end-year.



Nonconcessional financing. The Ministry of Finance will provide a listing and status
report for projects being considered for nonconcessional financing for end-June and
end-December of each year (see para. 52).

Program monitoring
68.
To ensure coordinated implementation of the government’s program, the Economic
Policy Coordinating Committee (EPCC), with participants from the Ministry of Finance,
Bank of Ghana, and other affected ministries, departments, and agencies (MDAs) will meet
on a regular basis to track progress under the various reform agendas. The EPCC, together
with the Ministry of Finance’s Public Expenditure Monitoring Unit, will have particular
responsibility for oversight of public spending to ensure compliance with budget limits.
69.
Furthermore, with the view to enhancing data dissemination and transparency, the
Ministry of Finance will post a broad range of macroeconomic data on a timely manner on its
website on a continuous basis, including (a) quarterly fiscal estimates, with a lag of no more
than 8 weeks, starting with the 2009 first quarter accounts and comparable quarterly data for
2008; (b) the Controller and Accountant General’s Department’s (CAGD) monthly statement
of the Final Accounts of the government with a maximum lag of 6 weeks; (c) annual data on
the staff strength of public sector workers and aggregate wage bill, broken down by MDAs.
70.
Quantitative performance criteria and structural benchmarks for 2009–2010 are set
out in Tables 1 and 2. Progress on structural reforms in the key areas previously mentioned,
namely tax policy and revenue administration, public expenditure management, public sector
reform, energy sector reform, the inflation targeting framework, and financial supervision
and regulation, will be monitored in the context of reviews. To facilitate such monitoring,
structural benchmarks for 2009-10 are set out in Table 2. In addition, given the need for close
monitoring in the context of an uncertain global environment, the program includes quarterly

55

reviews for 2009 followed by semi-annual reviews starting in 2010. The first review of the
program is expected to be completed by end-December 2009, with end-September 2009 as
the test date for the quantitative performance criteria; the second and third reviews under the
program are expected to be completed by end-April and end-October 2010, with endDecember 2009 and end-June 2010 as the test dates. Detailed definitions and reporting
requirements for all performance criteria are contained in the Technical Memorandum of
Understanding (TMU) attached to this letter.
71.
We believe that the policies specified in the MEFP provide a basis for sustaining
growth, reducing inflation, and alleviating poverty—but we stand ready to take additional
measures if required. The government will provide the Fund with the information needed to
assess progress in implementing our program as specified in the TMU, and will consult with
the Fund staff on any measures that may be appropriate at the initiative of the Government or
whenever the Fund requests a consultation. The Government intends to make this letter and
the TMU available to the public. In this context, it authorizes the IMF to arrange for them to
be posted on the Fund’s website, subsequent to Executive Board approval.
72.
Accordingly, we are requesting Board approval of the policies set forth in the MEFP,
and disbursement of the first loan installment, totaling SDR 387.45 million.

APPENDIX I―ATTACHMENT II
TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
Arrangement Under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility
July 2009-June 2012
1.
This technical memorandum of understanding (TMU) defines the variables subject to
quantitative targets (performance criteria and indicative targets), as specified in the Letter of
Intent (LOI). It also describes the methods to be used to assess the program performance and
the information requirements to ensure adequate monitoring of the targets. The authorities
will consult with the Fund before modifying measures contained in this letter, or adopting
new measures that would deviate from the goals of the program, and provide the Fund with
the necessary information for program monitoring.
2.
Program exchange rate: The exchange rates for the purpose of the program of the
Ghanaian cedi (GH¢) to the U.S. dollar will be GH¢ 1.45 per US$ 1, which is calculated as
the average of buying and selling exchange rates reported by banks to the Bank of Ghana as
of June 19, 2009. The exchange rates to other currencies will be calculated as the average of
buying and selling exchange rates against the U.S. dollar as of June 19, 2009.
I. Quantitative Program Indicators
3.
For program monitoring purposes, the performance criteria are set for end-September
2009, end-December 2009, and end-June 2010, while indicative target is set for end-March
2010. The performance criteria under the arrangement are: (a) a ceiling on the overall fiscal
deficit (including grants) of the government; (b) a floor on the net international reserves of
the Bank of Ghana; (c) a continuous zero ceiling for the accumulation of new external
arrears; and (d) a ceiling on the contracting or guaranteeing of new external nonconcessional
debt. Indicative targets are established as: (a) a ceiling on the net domestic financing of the
government; and (b) as a ceiling on the net domestic assets of the Bank of Ghana. A target is
set for the twelve-month rate of consumer price inflation, with triggers discussions or
consultations with the Fund if inflation moves outside specified inner and outer bands.
Performance criteria, indicative targets, and adjusters are calculated as cumulative flows
from the beginning of the calendar year.

59

A. Government
4.
Definition: The government is defined as comprising the central government, all
special funds (the Education Trust Fund, the Road Fund, the District Assembly Common
Fund, and the National Health Insurance Fund), and all subvented and other government
agencies that are classified as government in the Bank of Ghana (BOG) Statement of
Accounts (SOA). The Social Security and National Insurance Trust (SSNIT) and public
enterprises, including Cocobod, are excluded from the definition of government.
5.
The fiscal deficit is defined as the difference between total expenditures and the sum
of total revenues and total grants.
6.
Revenues comprise all tax and nontax revenues of the government (both in cedi and
in foreign currencies), excluding foreign grants and divestiture receipts. Revenue will be
measured on a cash basis as gross inflows to the government’s uncommitted treasury
collections accounts (as reported by the BOG).
7.
Expenditures comprise all spending from uncommitted accounts for Items 1-4, as
captured by the accounts of the Controller and Accountant General’s Department (CAGD),
transfers, payments to statutory funds, HIPC-financed expenditure, and VAT refunds.
Reporting will be based on the current National Expenditure Tracking System (NETS)
accounting system and its associated 15-digit chart of accounts and will be fully reconciled
with BOG bank statements on spending (outflows) from the ministries, departments, and
agencies’ (MDA’s) operational accounts (plus any residual use of existing treasury
drawing/overdraft accounts). Expenditure will also be verified by comparing it with accounts
produced by the Budget and Public Expenditure Management System (BPEMS) accounting
system, until such time as it becomes fully operational.
8.
The government will continue to report poverty-related expenditures, including
the use of funds from the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative.
Budgeted poverty spending for these categories will be taken from each year’s final
appropriations bill and will include spending financed by the government or donors or from
internally generated funds. Actual poverty-related spending will be identified using the last
3 digits of the 15-digit chart of accounts of the CAGD’s current NETS and the subcomponent
that is financed through HIPC Initiative debt relief. This data will be supplemented with that
proportion of transfers to the District Assembly Common Fund, the Ghana Educational Trust
Fund, and the Road Fund, which are deemed by those entities to be poverty-related.
Accordingly, actual poverty spending will exclude some donor-supported expenditure not
currently captured by the CAGD.

60

9.
Net domestic financing of government is defined as the change in net credit to
government by the banking system (i.e., the Bank of Ghana plus deposit money banks) plus
the net change in holdings of treasury bills and other government securities by the nonbank
sector, excluding divestiture receipts. Such credit will also exclude treasury bills issued for
open market operation purposes from January 1, 2003 onward (the holdings of which are
excluded from the BOG Treasury Department’s Debt Registry of central government
securities, and the proceeds of which are sterilized in deposits held as other BOG liabilities,
as defined in the monetary template provided to the IMF on December 3, 2003).
10.
Outstanding net credit to the government by the Bank of Ghana comprises the
sum of claims on government (SOA codes 0401 and 050101-4), including overdrafts of the
government with the BOG, less government deposits (1101 including the main HIPC
Initiative receiving account, and 1202) as defined in the monetary template.
11.
Outstanding net credit by deposit money banks comprises deposit money bank
(DMB) holdings of government securities at cost of purchase value, as reported by the BOG
Treasury Department’s Debt Registry, plus overdrafts less government deposits (the BOG’s
definition of government will be used for program purposes) as reported by DMBs in the
revised BSD2 report forms (and defined in the Monetary Template), plus deferred accrued
interest on their holdings of inflation-indexed bonds.
12.
Nonbank financing is the difference between total net cash receipts to the treasury
main cash account (issues/redemptions account when it becomes operational) from the
sale/repurchase of government securities, less the corresponding net cash value received from
the BOG and DMBs as indicated on the Debt Registry by holder at discount value, plus
deferred accrued interest on their holdings of inflation-indexed bonds. For each test date, any
adjustment by the BOG to the data reported by individual DMBs, on account of their
misclassification of government or for other reasons, will be reported to the Fund.
B. Consultation Mechanism on Inflation
13.
The quarterly consultation band for the twelve-month rate of consumer price
inflation (as measured by the headline consumer price index (CPI) published by the Ghana
Statistical Services) are specified in the text table: Inflation Targets. Projected CPI for endSeptember 2009, end-December 2009, and end-June 2010 will be subject to the consultation
mechanism, while those for end-June 2009 and end-March 2010 are indicative targets.

When the observed year-on-year CPI inflation rate falls outside a specific band,
this would trigger consultation with the Fund.


The authorities will complete consultation with the Executive Board of the
Fund on the proposed policy response before requesting further purchases
under the program when the observed year-on-year CPI inflation rate moves
outside the outer band as specified for the end of each quarter in the above
table. The authorities will not be able to request any further disbursements
under the PRGF arrangement if inflation moves outside of the outer band until
the consultation with the Executive Board has taken place.



The authorities will conduct discussions with the Fund staff when the
observed year-on-year CPI inflation rate falls outside the inner band as
specified for the end of each quarter in the above table.

15.
In line with our accountability principles, we are committed to report to the public the
reasons for any breach of the outer bands, and our policy response.
C. Bank of Ghana
16.
Net foreign assets are defined in the monetary survey as short- and long-term foreign
assets minus liabilities of the BOG that are contracted with nonresidents. Short-term foreign
assets include: monetary gold (valued at the spot market rate for gold, US$/fine ounce,
London), holdings of SDRs, reserve position and HIPC Initiative trust investment in the IMF,
the HIPC Initiative Umbrella SDR account (all as reported by the IMF), foreign notes and
travelers checks, foreign securities, positive balances with correspondent banks, and other
positive short-term or time deposits. Short-term foreign liabilities include foreign currency
liabilities contracted by the BOG at original maturities of one year or less (including

62

overdrafts), outstanding liabilities to the IMF, and deposits of international institutions at the
BOG. Long-term foreign assets and liabilities are comprised of: other foreign assets (BOG
statement of accounts code 303), investments abroad (a subset of 60201), other long-term
liabilities to nonresidents (a subset of 1103), and bilateral payment agreements (305). All
values not in U.S. dollars are to be converted to U.S. dollars at the exchange rates prevailing
at end-June 2009 and then into cedis at the program exchange rate. A more detailed listing of
accounts to be included in the measure of net foreign assets is contained in the monetary
template referred to in paragraph 7 above.
17.
Net international reserves of the BOG are defined for program monitoring purposes
and in the balance of payments as short-term foreign assets of the BOG, minus short-term
external liabilities. To the extent that short-term foreign assets are not fully convertible
external assets readily available to and controlled by the BOG (that is, they are pledged or
otherwise encumbered external assets, including, but not limited to, the HIPC umbrella SDR
account), they will be excluded from the definition of net international reserves. Net
international reserves are also defined to include net swap transactions (receivable less
payable) and exclude all positive foreign currency deposits at the BOG held by resident
deposit money banks, public institutions, nonfinancial public enterprises, other financial
institutions, and the private sector. All values not in U.S. dollars are to be converted to
U.S. dollars at the exchange rates prevailing at end-June 2009 and then into cedis at the
program exchange rate. A more detailed listing of accounts to be included in the measure of
net international reserves is contained in the monetary template referred to in the paragraph
above.
18.
Net domestic assets of the Bank of Ghana are defined as the difference between
reserve money and net foreign assets of the BOG, excluding the HIPC Umbrella SDR
account, converted from U.S. dollars to cedis at the program exchange rate.
D. External Debt and Debt Service
19.
Short-term external debt is defined as the outstanding stock of external debt with an
original maturity of one year or less, including overdraft positions and debt owed or
guaranteed by the government or the BOG. 1 Data on the BOG’s short-term external debt are
those reported from the statement of accounts template as short-term liabilities to nonresident
1

(A) The term “debt” has the meaning set forth in point No. 9 of the Guidelines on Performance
Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt (Decision No. 12274-(00/85) August 24, 2000). This includes
overdrafts on accounts with correspondent banks. (B) Excluded from this performance criterion are
normal import-related credits, pre-export financing credits of public enterprises, cocoa loans

Nonconcessional medium- and long-term external debt is defined as outstanding
stock of external debt contracted or guaranteed by the government or Bank of Ghana with an
original maturity of more than one year. 2 Medium- and long-term debt and its
concessionality will be reported by the Aid and Debt Management Unit of the Ministry of
Finance and Economic Planning, and will be measured in U.S. dollars at current exchange
rates.
21.
External payment arrears would accrue when undisputed interest or amortization
payments of the government are not made within the terms of the contract, or in conformity
with the terms for interim relief provided under the enhanced HIPC Initiative and the deferral
agreed with the Paris Club on December 10, 2001.
E. Adjustors to the Program Targets
22.

Program’s quantitative targets are subject to the following adjustors:
 Overall fiscal deficit of the government: the deficit ceiling will be adjusted upward
(downward) for higher (lower) than programmed project loans; downward (upward)
by 50 percent of lower than programmed program loans (grants), up to a maximum
adjustment of GHȼ$75 million; and downward for higher than programmed program
grants by full amount.

2

(A) This performance criterion applies not only to debt as defined in point No. 9 of the Guidelines
on Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt (Decision No. 12274-(00/85) August 24, 2000)
but also to commitments contracted or guaranteed for which value has not been received.
(B) Excluded from this performance criterion are: debts with a grant element equivalent to 35 percent
or more, calculated using currency-specific discount rates based on OECD commercial interest
reference rates; borrowing for specific high-return public infrastructure investment projects, subject to
prior consultation with the Fund. For 2009/10, the ceiling is set at US$300 million to allow for
possible guarantees to the Ghana National Petroleum Company to facilitate its participation in the
first phase of a program to exploit offshore gas deposits. The grant element of each loan will be
assessed with regard to the terms of the loan provided by a foreign official entity in connection with
the loan in question. Loans provided by a private entity will not be considered concessional unless
accompanied by a grant or grant element provided by a foreign official entity, such as both
components constitute an integrated financing package with a combined grant element equal to at
least 35 percent.

64

 Net international reserves of the Bank of Ghana: the floor will be adjusted upward for
any new SDR allocation. The NIR floor will also be adjusted upward for any excess
of budget grants and loans relative to the program baseline.
 Net domestic financing of the government: the ceiling will be adjusted upward by
50 percent of any shortfall in programmed program loans and grants, up to a
maximum adjustment of GH¢75 million. For higher than programmed loans and
grants, the ceiling will be adjusted downward by full amount.
 Net domestic assets of the Bank of Ghana: the ceiling will be adjusted downward for
any new SDR allocation.
F. Provision of Data to the Fund
23.
Data with respect to the variables subject to performance criteria and indicative
targets will be provided to Fund staff on a monthly basis with a lag of no more than eight
weeks (except for select data for which the reporting lag is explicitly specified in Table 1).
The authorities will transmit promptly to Fund staff any data revisions. For any information
(and data) that is (are) relevant for assessing performance against program objectives but is
(are) not specifically defined in this memorandum, the authorities will consult with Fund
staff.

Joint IMF and World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis

Prepared by the staffs of the World Bank and

Approved by Michael Atingi-Ego and Dominique Desruelle (IMF)
and Carlos Alberto Braga and Sudhir Shetty (World Bank)

June 29, 2009
This debt sustainability analysis (DSA) updates that prepared for the 2008 Article IV
consultation, discussions for which were completed in June 2008. 1 The starting point for the
DSA is less favorable than a year ago, reflecting the rise in the debt-to-GDP ratio between
end-2007 and end-2008 on account of the large fiscal deficit in 2008. At the same time,
notwithstanding the large fiscal deficit in 2008, the new government’s goals for fiscal
consolidation are more ambitious than those discussed a year ago. Further, there is now
greater assurance that oil production will start in 2011, and this assumption is now included
in the macroeconomic baseline. The combination of a more ambitious fiscal consolidation
sustained over the medium to long term, together with stronger real GDP growth and higher
export levels post-oil production all contribute to a more favorable DSA baseline than in
2008. Public sector net debt is projected to fall to less than 40 percent of GDP by the end of
the projection period from 60-70 percent of GDP in 2008- 2012. By contrast, DSA baseline
projections in 2008 showed public debt rising to exceed 80 percent of GDP over a 20-year
period. Notwithstanding this improvement, stress test analysis suggests that Ghana remains at
moderate risk of debt distress, in line with the 2008 DSA.
Key risks to Ghana's debt sustainability relate to the medium- to long-term fiscal outlook, as
well as the prospects for growth in a post-oil economy. The baseline depends on determined

fiscal adjustment in the near term, combined with rigorous efforts to limit borrowing needs
over the medium- to long-term. Failure to reduce the primary deficit from 2009 levels would
be associated with a near doubling of the public debt-to-GDP ratio over two decades.
Similarly, the baseline assumes sustained, strong growth in the non-oil, non-mineral
economy and a diversified and competitive export base. This will require macroeconomic
stability, continued improvements in the business climate, and prudent management of
Ghana’s oil revenues.
I.

BACKGROUND

1.
Ghana’s public debt at end-2008 was an estimated 58 percent of GDP. This
compares with a projection of 51 percent of GDP in the 2008 DSA. The less favorable
starting position for the current DSA reflects the larger than previously assumed fiscal deficit
in 2008 (14½ percent of GDP, or 4 percentage points higher than previously projected), as
well as the impact of currency depreciation on the foreign debt-to-GDP ratio in 2008. Public
sector external and domestic debts were similar in scale at end-2008, both close to
US$4 billion (29 percent of GDP each).
2.
External debt has risen rapidly since 2006—up from 17 to 29 percent of GDP.
This reflects Ghana’s $750 million Eurobond issue at end-2007, together with new
concessional bilateral financing, and new borrowing contracted from the IDA since 2006,
following the Multilateral Debt Reduction Initiative (MDRI). Data on private sector external
debt are of low quality, but appear to have remained broadly stable at about 15 percent of
GDP between 2007 and 2008.
3.
The sharp rise in Ghana’s external (and total) public debt during 2006-08
illustrates the risks to the DSA. A highly expansionary fiscal position financed by external
borrowing triggered a very rapid deterioration in the debt position. This trend was amplified
by the resulting balance of payments pressures and currency depreciation, which led to the
revaluation of foreign currency-denominated claims relative to domestic GDP. This debt
surge was effectively stemmed when Ghana’s access to market financing was closed off as a
result of the global financing crisis. Avoiding future such episodes of debt deterioration will
require more determined fiscal management as well as more cautious debt management
policies.

II. BASELINE SCENARIO
A. Fiscal and oil sector assumptions
4.
The baseline scenario features early correction of Ghana’s large fiscal deficit.
During 2009-10, the budget is strengthened by planned cuts in public spending, relative to
GDP, based on a rationalization of capital spending, efforts to contain wage bill expansion,
and the elimination of energy subsidies. At the same time, the revenue-to-GDP ratio is
projected to rise, reflecting the planned elimination of customs tariff and other tax

4

exemptions and rationalization of VAT thresholds and coverage. Moreover, government
revenues are projected to receive a boost from the planned implementation of a single
revenue authority for income, customs, and VAT tax collections. As a consequence, the
fiscal deficit is projected to decline from 14½ percent of GDP in 2008 to 6 percent in 2010. 2
5.
The fiscal accounts also benefit from 2011 onwards from Ghana’s projected
move to oil producer status. This is now more assured than a year ago, even if a declaration
of commercial viability remains to be issued (as of mid-June 2009). The DSA baseline
reflects planned production from the Jubilee I offshore oil field, but does not include possible
gas production or production from other oil fields for which exploration is still underway. Oil
production is assumed to average 120 thousand barrels per day during 2012-15, with a
subsequent steady decline. Based on the latest WEO projections, the price of Ghana’s oil
exports would increase to US$83 per barrel by 2014; prices are assumed to stabilize at this
level over the medium term in nominal terms. Oil revenues are projected to peak at about
6 percent of GDP during 2011-2017 (see Text Table). The government’s incomes reflect a
combination of income tax and royalty collections, production sharing agreements, and
provision for an additional oil entitlement if favorable oil prices result in a rate of return in
excess of specific thresholds. The latter element is tentatively projected to increase from
under 1 percent of GDP during 2011-2018 to more than 1½ percent of GDP during 2019-25.
6.
The DSA is strengthened, temporarily, by projected oil revenue savings. The
government is in the process of setting up a framework that would guide the utilization of oil
resources. For purposes of this DSA, we assume that one-third of tax and royalty revenues
would be saved, while two-thirds would be spent on growth-enhancing investment projects. 3
For the additional oil entitlement, which is a less predictable source of revenue, the DSA
assumes that one-half is saved, with the remainder spent, as above, on investment projects.
Oil savings are projected to reach a cumulative 6 percent of GDP by 2017, effectively
reducing public sector net indebtedness. 4 The saved oil revenues would support spending
over the long-term. When oil revenues begin a projected decline from 2019, spending would
be sustained in part by drawing down the accumulated oil savings. The oil savings account
would be depleted by 2028 and thereafter oil-related spending would be limited to about
1 percent of GDP, in line with residual oil revenues. Although the 2008 DSA baseline did not
2

The 8.5 percent of GDP reduction in the fiscal deficit during 2008-2010 is projected to occur through a
1.1 percent of GDP increase in revenues, 3.8 percent of GDP decline in expenditures, 0.1 percent of GDP
reduction in arrears, and an additional 3.5 percent of GDP in fiscal measures.

3

These projects are expected to address the key bottlenecks in developing the industrial and manufacturing
capacity of Ghana, including transportation infrastructure, telecommunication, power and energy, as well
enhancing the productivity of agriculture. Project selections would be guided by adequate cost-benefit analysis
yielding high rates of return.
4
The DSA assumes that oil savings are invested abroad and earn a yield in line with the U.S. dollar Libor
interest rate.

5

include potential oil production, this possibility was examined in an alternative scenario. 5
This scenario assumed that oil revenues would be saved throughout the DSA period, in
contrast to the assumption here that the revenue stream would be fully spent by the end of the
DSA. As a result, the impact of oil production in the 2008 alternative scenario was more
positive than in the DSA baseline prepared for this report.

B. Macroeconomic assumptions
7.
The DSA baseline assumes prudent economic policies to foster stable macroeconomic
conditions. A decline in inflation to single-digit levels and strong productivity growth would
support broad-based growth in the non-extractive sectors (Box 1).

5

See Figure 4 of the 2008 DSA.

6

Box 1: Baseline Macroeconomic Assumptions
Real GDP growth: After averaging more than 6 percent annually during 2004-08, output growth is set
to slow to below 5 percent during 2009-10 reflecting fiscal tightening and global slowdown. Real GDP
would expand by about 20 percent in 2011 as oil production begins. In the nonoil sector, growth is
projected to average 5-6 percent during 2012-29, reflecting broad-based non-mineral growth.
Inflation: Consumer price inflation exceeded 20 percent in the first quarter of 2009. A decline through
2009-2010 reflects slowing economic growth, fiscal tightening, and tight monetary policies. Over the
medium term, inflation is expected to converge to the Bank of Ghana’s target of 5 percent.
Government balances: The primary deficit is assumed to narrow to less than one percent of GDP over
the long-term. Expenditures would remain broadly stable in relation to the GDP, with a reprioritization
toward growth-oriented infrastructure investments financed by oil revenues. Foreign grant receipts are
projected to decline relative to GDP as Ghana benefits from oil incomes, but this is more than offset by
an increase in domestic revenues from non-oil taxation.
Current account balance: Over 2009-11, the current account deficit is projected to narrow but remain
at double-digit level in relation to GDP, reflecting imported equipments for the new oil fields as well as
projected government’s infrastructure investment. Beyond that, the current account deficit would narrow
to about 4-5 percent of GDP by the end of the forecasting period. This assumption is consistent with
fundamental determinants of Ghana’s domestic savings and investment, as explained in Box 2. Exports
are projected to peak at 62.3 percent of GDP during 2012, boosted by oil production. During 2019-2029,
declining oil exports are partly offset by strong growth in non-mineral exports, leaving exports at
47.4 percent of GDP in 2029.
Financing flows. Ghana’s deficit in trade in goods and services is projected to remain in the 1416 percent of GDP range. This would be financed, in large part, by private and public transfers averaging
14-15 percent of GDP, with a gradual decline in official transfers being offset by higher private transfers.
Non-debt creating inflows (mainly comprising foreign direct investment) are projected to average about
10 percent of GDP during 2009-14, largely reflecting development of the oil and gas sector. The growth
of the nonoil economy, including the expansion of services, is expected to attract foreign investment. As
oil activity wanes, these inflows would gradually decline to 4-5 percent of GDP during the medium-tolong run, in line with the average for Sub-Saharan African countries.

Box 2: Fundamental Determinants of Ghana’s Current Account Balance Norm
Economic theory suggests that the long-term external balance is influenced by the key fundamental
determinants of domestic savings and investments. Below parameter estimates from a panel study are used to

The above analysis suggests a current account deficit of about 4-5 percent of GDP in the medium-to-long-term.
For comparison, the estimate for current account deficit norm in 2009 using the same methodology yielded
8.6 percent of GDP. The difference reflects a smaller fiscal deficit, slowing population growth, and a smaller oil
import deficit.

IMF, Washington DC, 2008.

C. External Debt Sustainability
8.
The baseline displays stable external debt indicators, which remain well below
the respective thresholds (Figure 1). 6 These results show substantial improvement over the
2008 DSA where the external debt indicators gradually deteriorated over the medium-to-long
run, although remaining below the respective thresholds. This substantial improvement partly
reflects the inclusion of oil in the baseline scenario, which has the effect of increasing output
and export levels.
9.
The public sector external debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to rise modestly
between 2008 and 2029 (from 29 to 33 percent of GDP). The increase would be somewhat
larger in net present value terms (from 18 to 31 percent of GDP), reflecting an assumed
increase in nonconcessional borrowing. The NPV of private external debt is projected to
decline from 13.7 percent of GDP in 2008 to below 10 percent by 2029, as external financing
would be increasingly in the form of non-debt creating direct investment inflows (Table 1).
6

The World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) rates Ghana as a strong performer.
Under the joint IMF-World Bank debt sustainability framework, the corresponding indicative debt burden
thresholds are 50 percent for the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio, 200 percent for the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio,
and 25 percent for the debt-service-to-exports ratio. See Operational Framework for Debt Sustainability
Framework in Low-Income Countries—Further Consideration, available at www.imf.org and
www.worldbank.org.

8

10.
Increased borrowing at non-concessional terms raises the cost of servicing debt.
As Ghana becomes more prosperous and moves to middle-income status, the structure of the
country's external financing is likely to change. In particular, reduced grant and concessional
financing would give way to borrowing at non-concessional terms, which is typically at
shorter maturity and higher cost (in the DSA, the average maturity of non-concessional
borrowing is 6 years and the assumed interest rate is 8 percent). A shift to non-concessional
funding would leave the debt-to-GDP ratio largely unaffected, while increasing the debt
service ratios (measured relative to exports and government revenues, see Figure 1). The
DSA assumes a high-case level of non-concessional borrowing of US$0.5 billion annually
during 2009-14. 7 While this overstates current non-concessional borrowing plans, it ensures
that the DSA is resilient to higher outturns. This approach also covers the risks that nonconcessional borrowing will adversely affect the grant element of new IDA financing.
D. Stress Testing and Alternative Scenarios
11.
In the case of Ghana, standardized stress tests potentially overstate DSA risks.
The standard stress tests for growth and export performance assume that outturns during
2010-2011 fall short of the historic average by one standard deviation. This represents a
dramatic revision to baseline projections for 2011, where growth and exports are both
projected to surge with the start of oil production. 8 Given the step-like profile of oil
production and exports—with a one-off increase in 2011 followed by broad stability for the
following five-year period, these stress tests effectively eliminate the benefits of the oil sector
from the DSA baseline. Indeed, the outcome is worse than a scenario without oil, since oil
exports are eliminated without reducing the imports that they would have financed.
12.
The DSA is much more resilient when standardized tests are adjusted to reflect
the arrival of oil in 2011. We applied the standardized shocks to the period 2009-10, yet
retaining the oil-induced acceleration in real growth and exports starting in 2011 (Figure 1
and Table 2). In these stress tests, all debt indicators would remain below their respective
thresholds, except for the debt service-to-revenue ratio, which would exceed the threshold
level by a modest amount toward the end of the projection period.

7

The PRGF provides for a maximum of US$300 million of new non-concessional borrowing through mid-2010
to finance oil and gas projects. This explains the difference in external debt-to-GDP figures with the staff report.

8

Real GDP is projected to rise by 24 percent in 2011, while exports are projected to rise by 51 percent in dollar
terms.

9

E. Public Debt Sustainability
13.
The baseline scenario shows that Ghana’s net public debt would fall during the
medium term from 73 percent of GDP in 2010 to 37 percent by 2029. 9 This would return
the debt ratio to below the recent post-MDRI low of 41 percent in 2006. The projected
decline in debt-to-GDP ratio reflects a move to broad primary fiscal balance, which limits
new debt creation, combined with sustained economic expansion (Table 3).
14.
The DSA benefits from a projected decline in domestic borrowing. In the baseline
scenario, the present value of debt-to-GDP ratio benefits from a rebalancing from domestic to
foreign debt, which has higher concessionality. A more balanced reduction in foreign and
domestic debt would be associated with a less marked improvement in the present value of
debt-to-GDP ratio and the debt service indicators. At the same time, a larger reduction in
foreign debt would reduce vulnerability to exchange rate changes.
15.
The favorable DSA depends on successful fiscal stabilization. If the primary
balance remains at projected 2009 levels (5 percent of GDP) throughout the DSA, the present
value of debt would rise from 59 to 109 percent of GDP. The DSA is also sensitive to
currency valuation, with a 30 percent depreciation raising the present value of debt-to-GDP
ratio by 25 percentage points by the end of the projection period.
16.
The DSA is relatively insensitive to oil price assumptions. Alternative scenarios to
explore the impact of different oil price assumptions produced little net change in the DSA
baseline, though less favorable results are possible, depending on the assumptions. In a
straightforward balance of payments projection, a lower global oil price would result in
deterioration in the trade balance during 2011-15, when Ghana is a net oil exporter. But the
trade balance would strengthen in the subsequent period, when Ghana shifts back to net oil
importer status. As a result, Ghana’s resort to additional external financing is limited in
duration (2011-15), and offset by improvements in the balance of payments beyond 2015. At
the level of the public sector, the DSA impact depends on how spending responds to lower
oil revenues. The DSA baseline assumes that spending moves in line with oil revenues over
the long term, constrained by the assumption that oil-related spending slows once the oil fund
is depleted. If the government sought to maintain spending at higher levels, even in the
absence of the necessary oil fund savings, the DSA would be less favorable.

The higher level compared to the IMF staff report figures reflect the additional nonconcessional borrowing
included in the DSA analysis (para. 10).

III. CONCLUSIONS
17.
The 2009 DSA shows an improvement from last year under the baseline for key
debt indicators.. This reflects a tighter fiscal stance over the DSA period than in last year’s
DSA, combined with the incorporation of oil production in the baseline for the first time.
Debt ratios are projected to be broadly stable over the DSA period, rather than showing the
deteriorating trend evident in the 2008 baseline. Moreover, while the debt service indicators
rise, the trend is more favorable than in last year’s baseline. The stress test results are
generally favorable, once allowance is made for complications in applying standardized tests
to the period in which oil production and exports are projected to start. As discussed in
paragraph 12, the most extreme shocks are projected to leave the debt indicators well below
threshold levels except for the debt service-to-revenue ratio, which would slightly exceed the
35 percent threshold.
18.
Despite the baseline improvements, Ghana remains at moderate risk of debt
distress due to short- and medium-term vulnerabilities from two key factors: oil
revenues and fiscal performance. Even with oil production, failure to reduce the large
primary fiscal deficit and sustain this consolidation over the coming years would result in a
much less favorable DSA outlook. The historic scenario, which reflects the looser fiscal
stance in recent years, shows substantially higher debt-to-GDP and debt-service ratios, with
the former quickly exceeding the threshold levels. Therefore, the ability to sustain fiscal
consolidation over the medium to long term, and the potential to accelerate non-oil growth in
the medium term while oil revenues increase have emerged as key risks to an otherwise
favorable baseline.
19.
The DSA depends closely on prudent macroeconomic management of oil wealth.
The baseline assumes that oil production is combined with strong private sector investment
and sustained strong growth in the non-mineral sector, and continued export diversification.
This will require judicious use of oil revenues in terms of the size and nature of additional
public expenditure to limit Dutch disease effects. If the latter were to emerge as a problem,
the DSA would be adversely impacted. The new oil fields currently under exploration could
further improve the fiscal and growth performance in the baseline—though the premium on
prudent management of oil revenues would be redoubled. To minimize these risks, it will be
important to develop a strategy for using oil and gas revenues in a productive manner.

Source: Staff projections and simulations.
1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

IX. Safeguards Assessment
As Fund policy requires, the Bank of Ghana was subject to a safeguards assessment with
respect to the PRGF arrangement approved on May 9, 2003. The assessment, which was
completed on October 15, 2003, made recommendations for addressing specific
2

Assistance committed under the original framework is expressed in net present value (NPV) terms at the
completion point, and assistance committed under the enhanced framework is expressed in NPV terms at the
decision point. Hence these two amounts ca not be added.
3

Under the enhanced framework, an additional disbursement is made at the completion point corresponding to
interest income earned on the amount committed at the decision point but not disbursed during the interim
period.

4

The MDRI provides 100 percent debt relief to eligible member countries that qualified for the assistance.
Grant assistance from the MDRI Trust and HIPC resources provide debt relief to cover the full stock of debt
owed to the Fund as of end-2004 that remains outstanding at the time the member qualifies for such debt relief.

4
vulnerabilities in the external audit, financial reporting, internal audit, and internal controls
areas. The authorities confirmed that all measures proposed were implemented. In
accordance with IMF policy, an update safeguards assessment will be conducted no later than
the completion of the first review under the proposed new three-year arrangement under the
PRGF.
X. Exchange Rate Arrangement
On February 2, 1994, Ghana accepted obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3, and 4,
of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement. The exchange rate regime is classified as a managed
float with no pre-determined path. The system is free of restrictions on payments and
transfers for current international transactions. At the end of May 2009, the average exchange
rate for transactions in the interbank market was GH¢1.475 per U.S. dollar.
XI. Article IV Consultation
The 2008 Article IV consultation discussions were held in Accra during March 23-April 8,
2008. The staff report (Country Report No. 08/344) was discussed by the Executive Board on
June 30, 2008 and is posted on the IMF website.
XII. FSAP Participation
Ghana participated in the FSAP in 2000–01, and a Financial System Stability Assessment
(FSSA) was issued to the Executive Board in 2001. An FSAP update was presented to the
Board in December 2003.

III. GHANA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Data provided to the Fund are broadly adequate for surveillance purposes, but the
quality and timeliness of certain data need to be improved. There are notable deficiencies in
the dissemination of statistical information to the public, as well as in the reporting for Fund
publications, although the situation has improved recently with the publication on the Bank
of Ghana’s Web site of the Monetary Policy Committee Statement, Statistical Releases, and
monthly monetary series for 2001–09. Data for publication in the International Financial
Statistics (IFS) on international transactions were last reported for 2006, and monthly
government finances for 2008, and on national accounts for 1997. No quarterly balance of
payments data are currently reported for publication in the IFS. The latest available data
reported for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSY) are for 2008.
However, these data cover only the cash revenue and expense transactions of the budgetary
central government. Also, there have been long delays in the release by the Ghana Statistical
Service (GSS) of census and survey results, irregularity in the quarterly statistical digest. The
authorities are making efforts to improve the quality and timeliness of economic and
financial data through participation in the Fund’s General Data Dissemination System
(GDDS) and the external sector and government finance statistics modules of the GDDS
Project for Anglophone African Countries. GDDS metadata have been posted on the Fund’s
Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB) since July 2005, but need to be updated.
National accounts and prices
2.
The IMF’s Statistics Department has provided TA on national accounts (NA) over the
period 2001 to 2009. A “bundled” TA mission visited Accra during March 12–26, 2008, with
a follow-up mission in February 2009. The main objectives of these missions were to assist
the GSS in (a) developing a plan to adopt the System of National Accounts 1993 (1993 SNA);
(b) rebasing the national accounts—currently dating from 1993; and (c) ensuring that plans
are in place for a comprehensive data collection program to improve the source data.
3.
The February 2009 mission confirmed the recommendations of the March 2008 TA
mission that the 2004 Supply and Use Table (SUT) includes more updated and
comprehensive sources. It confirmed that Ghana’s national accounts are considerably
understated, and recommended that the 2004, which consolidates new data sources, should
be the basis for benchmarking the national accounts. The mission also pointed out some
minor areas where changes to the estimates should be undertaken. There are still some
concepts and methods that need to be addressed to insure compliance with the 1993 SNA.
Incorporation of new data sources and rebasing of the national accounts to 2004, planned to
be completed by end-2009. are likely to result in a significant upward revision of estimates of
GDP.

8
4.
Improving the source data by creating a statistical system built on a regular survey
program is a priority for increasing accuracy and reliability. In this regard the following areas
require action: (i) design and building a business register that have a minimum of information
on output values, if possible input values, and the number of employees. The 2003 National
Industrial Census 2004/2 (NIC) serves as a good starting point, but must be maintained and
extended to cover also service industries; (ii) create a national statistical system containing
regular business surveys for manufacturing, construction, transport and communication, and
other service industries (surveys on retail trade and NPISH are urgently needed); (iii) create a
system for annual household surveys that is less comprehensive than the current Living
Standards Survey (round 5) 2005/06 (GLSS) and which could be carried out on a more
frequent basis; and (iv) carry out an agricultural census.
5.
To address problems in the compilation of price statistics and national accounts,
a peripatetic advisor was assigned to Ghana during 2001–04. Follow-up technical
assistance has been provided under the GDDS project for Anglophone Africa. Work on
updating the CPI weights using the fourth Ghana Living Standard Survey (1998/1999) was
completed in mid-2006. In March 2007, STA assisted the GSS in developing a producer
price index (PPI), which is now published.
Labor statistics
6.
The scarcity of labor statistics is a cause for concern. Labor statistics are almost
nonexistent, although some wage indicators are available from the Social Security National
Insurance Trust (SSNIT). The Ministry of Employment has been receiving technical
assistance from the United Nations Development Program and the International Labor
Organization in the design and compilation of labor statistics.
7.
Steps have been taken to improve fiscal data. The Controller Accountant General
Department (CAGD) currently compiles monthly budget implementation reports, and the
data are available within six weeks, although some factors undermine their reliability. There
is a need for comprehensive and timely reconciliation of monthly treasury data with bank
accounts. To address these shortcomings, the government has formed a committee to define
the nature of “broad” and “narrow” government; moved to a system of immediate booking
for “direct debits” and more frequent reporting of government account balances; and is
implementing a new automated Budget and Public Expenditure Management System
(BPEMS). The BPEMS covers ministries, departments, and agencies. However, the
economic classification is not sufficiently detailed for data to be compiled in accordance with
the requirements of GFSM 2001. In June 2006 a STA mission proposed classification of
transactions in line with international guidelines.
8.
There are also problems of transactional coverage. The CAGD and the BOG have
been missing a substantial part of central government spending, such as donor flows
disbursed directly to ministries and those arising from internally generated funds. They have
also had difficulties in accounting for expenses paid by extrabudgetary funds. The operations

9
of special funds, such as the SSNIT, the Ghana Education Trust Fund (GETF) and the
District Assemblies Common Fund (DACF), are not yet covered in the fiscal accounts.
Although the majority of local government expenses are directly met from budgetary
accounts, the revenue of local governments and related spending, and transactions financed
from the DACF are not yet covered. Extending the coverage of fiscal data to general
government is strongly encouraged.
9.
Comprehensive solutions to some of the data problems may have to await full
implementation of the new BPEMS system and incorporation of Fund technical advice.
Various missions from FAD have suggested short-term, temporary solutions to alleviate
current data quality problems. A joint Bank-Fund mission in 2004 assessed progress on
monitoring poverty-related spending through the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC)
Assessments and Actions Plans; a Fiscal Transparency Report on Observance of Standards
and Codes (ROSC) was undertaken in July 2004; and STA provided further technical
assistance in March 2005.
10.
The country has elected to participate in the UK Department for International
Development (DFID) under the Phase 2 initiative, which is a continuation of the DFID
General Data Dissemination System Project for Anglophone Africa. The purpose of this
project is to enhance the capacity of participating countries’ statistical systems. The DFID
Phase 2 Project will rely on the GDDS framework to introduce improvements in fiscal
reporting based on the methodology of the GFSM 2001. The Project ends in April 2009 and
is expected that two or three missions will be required to complete the GFS module. An STA
mission recommended an enhancement of the chart of accounts so as to include financing
transactions and additional details on revenue and expense classifications. This mission also
assisted the authorities with bridging their data with the GFSM 2001 framework. It
recommended establishing an interagency working group to delineate the general
government sector to ensure consistency of coverage amongst all datasets. The mission has
also initiated the compilation of data for extrabudgetary and social security funds and
recommended, as a first step, to expand coverage of fiscal data to at least the consolidated
central government.
Monetary statistics and international reserves
11.
While BOG had made significant progress implementing the previous missions’
recommendations on monetary and financial statistics, continued efforts are needed to
improve the methodological soundness of the data. There have been three mission on to
Ghana during 2007-09 in this area. The 2007 mission focused on the residency criterion in
the BOG accounting data used as the source to generate monetary statistics, and in the
sectorization of the government accounts with other depository corporations (ODCs). The
mission assisted the BOG to automatically derive the standard forms to report monetary
statistics (SRFs) for the central bank (SRF 1SR) and the ODCs (SRF 2SR) to STA, in light of
the recommendations of the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual. The BOG currently
reports monthly data with a lag of four to six weeks, and data from the ODCs with a lag of

10
eight to ten weeks. The March 2008 mission found that significant progress has been
achieved in implementing STA’s earlier recommendations, especially to improve data for the
ODCs. The mission agreed with the BoG staff on a plan to expand the coverage of the ODCs
to include the savings and loans companies, rural banks, money market mutual funds, and
credit unions; and compiled a comprehensive list of the financial corporations operating in
Ghana, including the timing and frequency of the data reported to the various regulatory
agencies. The mission proposed that the BoG starts compiling the Other Financial
Corporations (OFCs) Survey, covering finance and leasing companies.
12.
The April-May 2009 mission concluded that the implementation of earlier advice
was uneven. While substantial progress was made in strengthening the source data for the
BOG and expanding institutional coverage of the ODCs to include rural banks and savings
and loans companies, the progress in improving data collection and compilation from the
OFCs had been slow. To enhance coordination among financial regulatory agencies and
improve data collection on the OFCs, the authorities agreed to establish an inter-agency
committee. The mission helped BOG migrate to standardized report forms and an integrated
monetary database, as well as expand the institutional coverage (see above). With the wider
coverage of institutions, the authorities need to reconsider the definition of broad money,
which currently only includes DMBs and thus may understate the aggregate.
Debt statistics
13.
The responsibility for external debt recording and payment is divided among
three agencies. The MOFEP, through its Aid and Debt Management Unit (ADMU),
maintains the external debt database. It is responsible for recording debt-payment
obligations, issuing payment requests, and tracking HIPC debt relief. The CAGD confirms
the legality of the payment and authorizes the release of public funds. It is responsible for
accounting for debt payments and rendering reports to parliament. The BOG as the payment
agent for the government verifies payments made to ADMU and CAGD.
14.
An FAD technical assistance mission in 2001 concluded that the three institutions
needed to improve the transparency and accountability of external debt management.
The authorities should (i) develop a single computerized database that is available to all three
institutions; (ii) formalize procedures used for settling debt payments (including obtaining
debt notification from donors, delegating signing authorities of officials within the relevant
organizations, and creating registers tracing the movement of the documents required to
effect external debt payment); and (iii) improve the analytical content and timeliness of data,
which are not currently reported at regular intervals.
15.
To enable systematic comparison of the budget, the balance of payments, and the
BOG cash-flow data, the authorities should clearly identify the government subsectors for
which data are reported and prepare a clear classification of financing, outstanding debt, and
guarantees issued.

11
Trade and balance of payments statistics
16.
Since 1982 the BOG Research Department has had primary responsibility for the
compilation and presentation of the annual and quarterly balance of payments (BOP)
statistics. Data are compiled based on the Balance of Payments Manual, Fifth Edition
(BPM5). The main data sources were the Customs Excise and Preventive Service (CEPS),
administrative data (government ministries and departments within BOG), commercial
banks, and the GSS. In addition, the BOG carried out simple financial surveys on other
corporate entities that are involved in transactions with nonresidents. Starting from 2007,
Ghana participated in the external sector module of the DFID project. Three TA missions
have been conducted under the auspices of this project to undertake a comprehensive
enterprise survey of cross-border financial flows and stocks with a view to significantly
improving the quality of BOP and international investment position (IIP). The latest
February/March 2009 TA mission finalized survey data entry, and verified and grossed-up
survey results to construct BOP and IIP statements. The mission concluded that the survey
findings are of good quality and should be incorporated into BOP compilation program. The
BOG should contribute towards further success of other surveys by pursuing activities that
promote improvement of standards and timeliness of reporting of financial statements by
enterprises. Efforts in this direction could be focused on non-multinational enterprises whose
financial statements were in many cases not comprehensive. Partnerships with accounting
bodies and other institutions such as the auditor general’s office will be explored in this
direction.
17.
Currently, the GSS is not publishing timely monthly trade statistics, although
the data are available from the CEPS. The staff has recommended that the GSS
collaborate with the CEPS to process customs data within six weeks and with the Ministry of
Trade and Industry (MOT) and the BOG to identify and reduce discrepancies in trade
statistics and to ensure that imports into bonded warehouses are not double-counted. Data
collection procedures of the CEPS need to be improved, and there is also room for improving
trade volume data collected by the CEPS through customs invoices, which would help the
GSS to extract meaningful import and export unit values.
18.
Fund staff has recommended that the GSS produce export unit values for major
export commodities, such as gold and cocoa. A high coverage of the country’s export
bundle can be obtained from just three major exports—cocoa, gold, and unwrought
aluminum. In contrast, deflation of imports is likely to require an iterative procedure to strike
a balance between coverage of the index and its stability, owing to the heterogeneity of the
basket.

Statement by the Staff Representative on Ghana
July 15, 2009

This statement provides information on recent economic developments in Ghana that has
become available since the staff report was circulated to the Board on June 30, 2009.
These developments do not change the thrust of the staff appraisal.
Preliminary fiscal data for January to April 2009. These show a fiscal deficit of GHc 359
million, slightly less than half of the January-June indicative ceiling. The fiscal data have
been posted on the Ministry of Finance website, consistent with the government’s goals to
strengthen fiscal transparency (MEFP, ¶69).
Public sector wage negotiations. Agreement has been reached with the education service on
a 17 percent wage increase for 2009, retroactive to January. This is consistent with the
budget’s wage bill provision, and is expected to establish a benchmark for wage setting with
other public workers.
Projects being considered for non-concessional foreign financing. A listing has been
compiled and provided to staff, advancing the earlier timetable to make this submission at the
time of the first PRGF review (MEFP, ¶54). The projects are mostly related to energy and
transportation infrastructure, and the government will review these projects with staff, as
outlined in the MEFP, at the time of the first review. Pending this discussion, the government
has reiterated its intention not to borrow on nonconcessional terms in foreign currency, except
for possible guarantees for GNPC oil and gas-related borrowing described in the MEFP.
Consumer price inflation. 12-month CPI inflation rose from 20.1 percent in May to
20.7 percent in June. Excluding the impact of a 30 percent rise in petroleum product prices in
early-June, inflation would have fallen to 20.0 percent in June, slightly above the indicative
inflation target of 19.7 percent in the government’s program (MEFP, table 1).
Publication authorization. The authorities have communicated their consent for the Fund to
publish the staff report for the 2009 Article IV Consultation discussions and request for a
three-year arrangement under the PRGF and all related documents.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes Article IV Consultation with Ghana
On July 15, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Ghana. 1
Background
Ghana’s economic growth rose to a two-decade high of 7.3 percent in 2008. This
reflected expansionary fiscal policies combined with an upswing in private sector activity
based on strong credit expansion, buoyant remittances, and strong agricultural yields.
Inflation rose on account of external shocks and strong domestic demand. After falling
briefly to single-digits in 2006, inflation rose through 2007–08, reflecting global food and
fuel price shocks, strong domestic demand, and the pass through from currency
depreciation. In January-May 2009, inflation stabilized in the 20 percent range.
The fiscal deficit surged to 14.5 percent of GDP in 2008, reflecting rapid public spending
growth, with capital spending, energy subsidies, and wage and salaries each rising by
more than 1 percentage point of GDP. The 2008 fiscal deficit drew on exceptional
foreign financing amounting to 7.3 percent of GDP, comprising resources from the late1

2007 Eurobond issue and proceeds from the sale of Ghana Telecom. In addition, the
central bank provided financing equivalent to more than 3 percent of GDP.
Monetary policy was tightened in response to rising inflation. The Bank of Ghana
increased its benchmark lending rate by 6 percentage points between October 2007 and
February 2009, and market conditions tightened by more, as reflected in interbank and
treasury bill rates. The policy rate was left unchanged in May 2009 on an assessment
that inflationary pressures were easing. Notwithstanding interest rate increases, the
prime rate has been lower than annual inflation since early-2008, while real interbank
rates have been only slightly positive. The banking sector has continued to register
strong asset growth, with private sector credit up 56 percent in the year to April 2009.
This expansion continues to reflect local deposit mobilization, with broad money up
28 percent on the same basis.
Ghana’s overall financial system remains stable. The regulatory and supervisory
framework is strong, backed by a modern payment and settlement infrastructure.
Financial Soundness Indicators (FSIs) point to a banking system that is liquid and with
capital above statutory levels. However, some recent deterioration is evident: nonperforming assets are high and rising (9.6 percent in March 2009); profitability is
declining; and a few banks are financially strained. The Bank of Ghana has required
banks to raise their minimum capital to GHȼ 60 million (about $40 million) to allow them
to play a larger role in the rapidly growing economy. The non-banking sector (insurance,
pensions and capital markets) has continued to perform well.
Ghana’s external current account deficit widened to 19 percent of GDP in 2008, up from
12 percent of GDP a year earlier. This largely reflected a 33 percent increase in non-oil
imports values, driven by strong domestic demand. Financing was provided through an
increased external capital account surplus, buoyed by Ghana Telecom privatization
proceeds (5½ percent of GDP), and a draw-down of gross international reserves from
$2.8 billion to $2.0 billion. Reflecting the latter, gross reserve cover declined from 2.7 to
2.2 months of projected import cover. In the first quarter of 2009, exports have remained
buoyant, but private remittances fell by 18 percent from a year earlier.
Exchange rate flexibility has increased since mid-2008. Reflecting Ghana’s
macroeconomic imbalances, the exchange rate depreciated about 50 percent against
the dollar during 2008 and the first half of 2009. Much of this adjustment was offset,
however, by Ghana’s high inflation rate and the appreciation of the dollar in the context
of the global financial crisis. Accordingly, the real effective exchange rate in April 2009
was just 8 percent more depreciated than in 2007. Over the recent period, illiquidity in
the foreign currency market has been associated with a decline in interbank trading and
a widening of spreads.

Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that after a decade of gains in real income and poverty
reduction, Ghana’s macroeconomic situation had weakened owing to exogenous shocks
and highly expansionary fiscal policies, in particular in the run-up to the elections, that
contributed to higher inflation and large external imbalances. While Ghana’s terms of
trade are projected to strengthen in 2009, supporting incomes and growth, Directors
recognized the uncertain environment and the downside risks. Starting in 2011, oil
production is expected to bolster growth and fiscal revenues, creating new challenges
for macroeconomic management.
Directors supported the authorities’ efforts to restore macroeconomic stability by seeking
to achieve fiscal sustainability. They endorsed as appropriately ambitious the deficit
target of 9.4 percent of GDP for 2009, welcoming the combination of expenditure
restraint and revenue enhancing measures. Noting that Ghana remains at moderate risk
of debt distress, Directors emphasized that further fiscal consolidation will be critical
over the medium-term. A number of Directors stressed the importance of pursuing
prudent debt management, especially as regards nonconcessional borrowing.
Reforming mandatory and inflexible budgetary outlays would create space for more
productive and priority development spending. Directors also supported the
maintenance of Ghana’s broad social safety net program that should protect vulnerable
groups. They were encouraged that the authorities stand ready to take additional
measures to achieve their deficit targets.
Directors observed that expected oil revenues would create new fiscal space but on a
relatively modest scale and for a fairly short period. They emphasized, therefore, that
the authorities should not be complacent about the fiscal outlook and new revenues
should be used wisely. The authorities’ intention to extend Ghana’s participation in the
Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative to the oil sector was welcomed. Directors
believed that high priority should be given to strengthening public financial management,
enhancing the efficiency of public spending, and strengthening domestic revenue
mobilization.
Directors noted that inflation in 2008 had substantially exceeded the authorities’ target,
largely due to highly expansionary fiscal policies which were not fully offset by monetary
tightening. With a tighter fiscal stance, it would be an opportune time for monetary policy
to reduce inflation. Therefore, in light of the negative real interest rates and the need to
increase credibility of the inflation targeting framework, Directors supported a further
tightening in the monetary stance. They concurred with the authorities’ renewed
emphasis on communications and transparency to enhance the inflation-targeting
framework.

4

Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to maintain a flexible exchange rate regime
consistent with their inflation-targeting framework. They also welcomed the authorities’
plans to use a possible SDR allocation to rebuild foreign exchange reserves. Directors
noted the staff’s assessment that the recent depreciation had partly corrected the earlier
overvaluation.
Directors observed that Ghana’s financial system has so far been generally insulated
from the global crisis. They recognized, however, that strains had emerged after several
years of rapid banking expansion, including a deterioration in loan portfolios. While
noting progress made in supervisory capacity, Directors pointed to the need to further
strengthen supervision, including cross-border coordination, and to reinforce risk
management and corporate governance. Directors welcomed the authorities’ request for
a Financial Sector Assessment Program update.
Directors encouraged the authorities to enhance the quality and timeliness of data
reporting to the Fund. They welcomed the authorities’ plans to improve estimates of
national accounts statistics following recent IMF technical assistance.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Approves US$602.6 Million
PRGF Arrangement for Ghana
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has approved a threeyear arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) for Ghana
in an amount equivalent to SDR 387.45 million (about US$602.6 million) to support the
government's economic program to tackle macroeconomic instability. The approval will
enable an initial disbursement of SDR 67.65 million (about US$105.2 million)
immediately.
At the conclusion of the Executive Board's discussion on Ghana's request for a PRGF
arrangement, which was held on July 15, 2009, Mr. Takatoshi Kato, Deputy Managing
Director and Acting Chair, stated:
“Ghana’s macroeconomic conditions deteriorated substantially during 2008, reflecting
global shocks to food and fuel prices and highly expansionary fiscal policies, in
particular in the run-up to the elections. Inflation rose to about 20 percent and the
current account deficit widened appreciably, putting pressure on Ghana’s international
reserves and the exchange rate. Growth is projected to moderate in 2009, with potential
additional downside risks stemming from the global recession.
“The authorities’ economic adjustment program appropriately centers on efforts to reestablish macroeconomic stability. The budget deficit target of 9.4 percent of GDP in
2009, down from 14.5 percent in 2008, is appropriately ambitious. In light of the limited
scope for countercyclical fiscal policy in Ghana, the authorities stand ready to take
additional measures to achieve their deficit targets in the event of revenue shortfalls.
“The authorities’ planned reduction of the budget deficit to 4½ percent of GDP in 2011,
and below this level in subsequent years, will be critical to restoring public debt
sustainability. To help achieve this fiscal goal, the authorities should ensure that

2

petroleum pricing and utility tariffs allow for full cost recovery to avoid large subsidy
costs. More effective control will also be needed over the public sector wage bill, and
steps should be taken to modernize the tax regime and strengthen collection.
“Oil revenues that are expected to start in 2011 will create important new fiscal space
and potentially bring Ghana close to middle-income status. While these revenues can
help to support Ghana’s fiscal consolidation, the authorities should not be complacent
about the fiscal outlook in 2011 and beyond. The horizon for oil production could prove
relatively short, and it will be important that the new revenues be used wisely.
Accordingly, high priority should be given to strengthening public financial management
under the authorities’ program.
“Monetary policy implementation under the authorities’ inflation targeting framework
aims to reduce inflation to single-digit levels by 2010. While the disinflation process will
be supported by the planned fiscal consolidation, rising global oil prices and continuing
depreciation of the Ghanaian cedi pose risks to inflation. The Bank of Ghana should be
ready to tighten monetary conditions further should conditions warrant. Looking forward,
the Bank of Ghana should also strengthen its communications strategy and the
transparency of the inflation targeting framework.
“Ghana’s financial system has so far been relatively resilient in the face of global
developments, but vulnerabilities have emerged following rapid banking sector
expansion in recent years, and loan portfolios have deteriorated. The authorities should
ensure close supervision and encourage commercial banks to reinforce risk
management and corporate governance practices. Gaps in cross border supervision will
also require stronger regional collaboration.
“The depreciation of the cedi since the second half of 2008 has helped the process of
balance of payments adjustment, and continued flexibility will be important. Efforts
should continue to rebuild foreign exchange reserves in order to enhance Ghana’s
ability to weather future external shocks.

ANNEX
Recent Economic Developments
Ghana’s growth remained strong in 2008 at 7.3 percent, up from 5.7 percent of GDP in
2007. Since 2000, growth has been supported by significant debt relief, which provided
the country with fiscal space to invest in infrastructure, and the social sectors. Thanks to
the combination of higher growth, declining inflation and improved social spending,
poverty levels have significantly declined. Ghana is poised to achieve the Millennium
Development Goal of halving extreme poverty ahead of 2015.
Fiscal performance deteriorated sharply during 2007-08, partly due to a severe energy
crisis in 2006-2007 and the global food and fuel crisis in 2008, but also importantly due
to highly expansionary fiscal policies ahead of the end-2008 presidential elections. As a
consequence, the fiscal deficit jumped from 9.2 percent of GDP in 2007 to 14.5 percent
in 2008.
The strong public spending combined with rapid credit expansion contributed to a large
increase in inflation and a deterioration of the external current account. Year-on-year
inflation rose to the 20 percent range in early-2009 from 12.7 percent in 2007, while the
current account deficit widened to 19.3 percent of GDP in 2008, compared with a
12.0 percent of GDP in 2007. The overall balance of payment recorded a deficit of
US$941 million in 2008, compared with a surplus of US$413 million in 2007, with the
former financed by a drawdown of international reserves.
Program Summary
The government’s medium-term macroeconomic program builds on Ghana’s second
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper. It aims to substantially reduce Ghana’s large fiscal
imbalances by 2011 and put in place strengthened institutions for public financial
management.
The macroeconomic framework for 2009-11 aims to achieve:
• A real non-oil GDP growth of about 5½ percent on average.
• A medium-term inflation to 7-9 percent per year.
• An overall budget deficit of 4.5 percent of GDP in 2011.
• International reserves coverage equal to about 3 months of imports.
To achieve these objectives, medium-term policies include:

4

• Reducing the deficit, including through revenue mobilization, cuts in low-priority
spending, and flexible pricing of energy products to avoid costly subsidies.
• Implementing a comprehensive program to improve public financial management.
• Implementing a comprehensive public sector reform program.
•Further strengthening the recently-adopted inflation targeting regime, including by a
revamped central bank communications strategy

Statement by Jafar Mojarrad, Executive Director for Ghana
and John Kwabena Kwakye, Advisor to Executive Director
July 15, 2009
My Ghanaian authorities appreciate the constructive dialogue with staff on the Article IV
consultation and the PRGF arrangement. After a decade of strong gains in per capita incomes
and poverty reduction, Ghana’s macroeconomic performance has weakened in the past three
years due to adverse exogenous factors, including the fuel and food price shocks and the
spillovers of the global financial crisis and economic slowdown, but also following
increasingly expansionary policies, especially in the run up to the presidential and
parliamentary elections. Having assumed the reins of power only in January 2009 after the
elections, the new government’s overriding objective is to achieve economic prosperity for
all Ghanaians in accord with its socio-democratic principles. Therefore, the authorities are
committed to restore macroeconomic stability and place the economy on a path of sustained
high growth to accelerate progress toward reaching the MDGs and middle-income status for
Ghana. They request a PRGF arrangement to support their stabilization and reform program
for 2009-12.
Recent developments
Ghana’s economic performance improved markedly during 2001-06, with robust growth, a
significant decline in inflation, and narrowing fiscal and current account deficits. Debt relief
under the HIPC Initiative and MDRI improved the country’s debt situation and freed
resources for social spending. As a result, the incidence of poverty was significantly reduced
along with improvement in other social indicators, including in education, health, and gender
representation. Substantial progress was also made in structural reforms, particularly in the
fiscal area, where revenue and expenditure management was strengthened; in the monetary
area, which saw steady progress in liquidity management and eventual adoption of an
inflation targeting (IT) framework; and in the financial sector, with important structural and
institutional reforms to strengthen the system and increase its resilience and contribution to
private sector development.
Since 2006, Ghana’s economy came under stress from a succession of external and domestic
shocks, including a severe drought, which triggered an acute energy crisis, and the global
food and fuel price hikes. The energy crisis necessitated large scale investment in the thermopower generation, whereas food tariffs were reduced and energy subsidies increased in view
of the social concerns about raising domestic prices in line with the sharply increasing
international prices. The energy crisis in particular, made the implementation of the price
adjustment mechanism very difficult. These, together with increased spending in the run up
to the 2008 elections, resulted in higher fiscal and external current account deficits, a fall in
reserves, a marked rise in inflation, and sharp exchange rate depreciation. However, real
GDP growth in 2008 rose to a record high, supported by buoyant agricultural production and

2
strong domestic demand.
Encouragingly, the banking system has remained sound, well capitalized, and fairly liquid,
with a reduction in credit concentration, intensified competition, and expansion in branch
networks. Thus far, the sector has not been significantly affected by the global crisis.
The outlook for 2009 and the medium term
Like other Sub-Saharan African countries, Ghana is being affected by the global economic
downturn through the channels of remittances, portfolio investment flows, and FDI.
Nonetheless, these adverse developments are partly offset by favorable market conditions for
cocoa and gold and the decline of oil import prices. Against this background, the growth
deceleration in 2009 will be somewhat contained.
Over the medium term, the start of oil production in 2011 will have beneficial effects on
growth, the fiscal situation, and the balance of payments. The authorities intend to manage
prudently the oil resources and ensure their cautious phasing into the economy. They are
fully aware of the challenges posed by increased oil revenue for macroeconomic
management and will continue the national dialogue on the use of oil revenue while drawing
on international best practices in this area. Non-oil GDP growth is expected to reach
6 percent on average during 2010-2014, while inflation is to be brought down gradually to
5 percent. The external current account deficit should narrow steadily to 6 percent by 2014,
and gross international reserves should recover to over 4 months of imports. The public debt
will be stabilized and subsequently reduced.
Policies for 2009
The authorities are committed to restoration of macroeconomic stability, which they consider
critical to achieving sustained growth and durable poverty reduction. Their strategy to this
end is underpinned by fiscal discipline based on prudent expenditure management and
enhanced revenue mobilization. In 2009, the fiscal deficit will be reduced by more than
5 percent of GDP to 9.4 percent through a combination of expenditure reductions and
revenue-enhancing measures. Expenditure cuts will affect goods and services, transfers, and
non-developmental capital spending. On the revenue side, intakes are being enhanced by
increasing a range of taxes and fees and improving collection.
First quarter revenue and non-interest expenditures are broadly on track. To offset the higherthan projected interest costs, and achieve the targeted fiscal deficit, additional fiscal savings
totaling at least 1.0 percent of GDP are being implemented. The projected financing gap
beyond available domestic borrowing is expected to be covered by assistance from the World
Bank and exceptional budget support from other development partners. Any shortfall in
program grant and loan financing will be offset by spending cuts.

3
A tight monetary policy will complement fiscal policy to ease pressure on the balance of
payments and the exchange rate. The Bank of Ghana (BoG) responded to the rising inflation
by increasing its Prime Rate by a cumulative 350 basis points in 2008, and further by
150 basis points in February 2009. The BoG will use its IT regime to achieve disinflation,
with the support of fiscal consolidation, and restore stability to the foreign exchange market.
Inflation is projected to decline to 14½ percent by end-2009. With exceptional budget
support and expected Fund financing, gross international reserves are projected at slightly
below two months of import cover.
The medium-term program
Fiscal discipline will continue to underpin the authorities’ medium-term objectives of
achieving macroeconomic stability. The fiscal deficit will be progressively brought down to
4½ percent of GDP in 2011, and reduced further in subsequent years, driven by revenue
mobilization and cuts in low-priority public spending, while shifting expenditure towards
infrastructure investments. This will provide the needed support for monetary policy to
reduce inflation to single digit from 2010 and stabilize price and exchange rate expectations.
The BoG will continue to maintain a flexible exchange rate regime, consistent with the IT
framework, with interventions limited to smoothing short-term fluctuations.
The authorities’ structural reform agenda focuses on the fiscal area, public sector, debt
management, energy sector, and financial sector. In the fiscal area, reforms aim at
strengthening institutions, enhancing revenue mobilization, and reinforcing public
expenditure management. Wide-ranging tax policy and administration reforms are planned,
including streamlining exemptions, minimizing leakages, broadening the base of VAT and
income tax, and modernizing and integrating revenue administration. Establishing a proper
framework for the management of oil revenue will receive priority attention, including
introducing appropriate revenue-management legislation and adherence to EITI principles.
To strengthen fiscal discipline, fiscal responsibility laws are being developed to lay out rules
to help achieve desired fiscal outcomes. Building on recent progress in PFM reforms, efforts
will focus on addressing weaknesses in expenditure monitoring, managing commitments and
arrears, establishing a cash management framework that will provide an early warning
system, and improving selection and evaluation of investment projects.
The authorities intend to address the heavy burden of the public sector wage bill in the
context of a comprehensive public sector reform program with World Bank assistance.
Reform will focus, in particular, on the pay system and optimum enrollment levels. It will
also address rigidities in the budget arising from statutory funds and committed expenditures
by reviewing their legal provisions and management in order to enhance policy flexibility
and efficiency. The authorities intend to address the financial difficulties of state-owned
enterprises to minimize fiscal risks. They plan to move speedily to ensure completion of the
study to review the financial status of all three power sector utilities and propose a
restructuring and recovery program that will ensure their long-term viability. To address the

4
cost of energy subsidies, the government intends to maintain the current system of costrecovery price adjustments for petroleum products and will adjust electricity tariffs to costrecovery levels, as needed, by end-2009. The restructuring of agencies that are recipient of
government subsidies will be stepped up, with the view to liquidating nonviable ones and
commercializing others, as necessary.
While the updated DSA shows improvement over last year’s, the authorities recognize that
there are vulnerabilities, particularly to oil revenues and fiscal performance, which they
intend to address. A comprehensive debt management strategy will set a clear framework for
borrowing and guide decisions regarding concessional financing as well as the financing of
critical projects that may require state guarantee. The authorities will inform the Fund on
projects being considered for nonconcessional financing, starting from the first program
review, and request that limits on nonconcessional borrowing be set to accommodate those
projects.
On the financial sector, the BoG has embarked on a comprehensive program of risk-based
supervision and wide-ranging regulations which will underpin the development of robust and
resilient financial sector and also address risks associated with weak governance structures.
A recent increase in capital requirements was meant to strengthen banks as well as extend
their reach in a rapidly growing economy. The domestic debt market is being actively
developed to deepen financial markets and to improve the efficiency of the government’s
debt operations. Given the extensive changes in Ghana’s financial sector since the last FSAP
update, the authorities are interested in an early update.
Conclusion
My Ghanaian authorities are grateful to the Board and management for their support, which
would catalyze assistance from other development partners and attract FDI. They reiterate
their commitment to take the necessary measures to keep their program on track and enable
them to achieve their socio-economic goals. They recognize that the global crisis reinforces
the urgency to step up adjustment and reform policies and to mobilize external financing,
consistent with a prudent debt strategy. While there are risks to the program, the authorities
stand ready to adjust their policies, as necessary, to mitigate them in consultation with Fund
staff.
