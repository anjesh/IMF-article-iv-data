Staff Report for the 2012 Article IV Consultation, Sixth Review Under the Stand-By
Arrangement, and Requests for Waiver of Nonobservance of Performance Criterion
and Modification of Performance Criteria
Prepared by the European Department in Consultation with Other Departments
Approved by Poul M. Thomsen and Vivek Arora
September 13, 2012
Discussions: Held in Bucharest during August 1–14, 2012. The mission met with interim
President Antonescu, Prime Minister Ponta, Deputy Prime Minister Georgescu, National Bank
of Romania (NBR) Governor Isarescu and other senior officials, and representatives of
political parties, labor and business organizations, and financial institutions. The staff team
comprised E. de Vrijer (head), J. Ralyea; A. Tuladhar; C. Saborowski (all EUR);
J. Bersch (SPR); F. Eich (FAD); and H. Hesse (MCM). T. Lybek (Resident Representative)
assisted the mission. Discussions were held jointly with staff from the European Commission.
S. Matei (Senior Advisor to the Executive Director) and World Bank staff attended some of the
meetings; European Central Bank staff participated as an observer.
Stand-By Arrangement: A 24-month, SDR 3,090.6 million (€3.4 billion, US$5.0 billion,
300 percent of quota) Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) was approved by the Executive Board on
March 25, 2011 (Country Report No. 11/80) and became effective March 31, 2011. The
seventh tranche of SDR 430 million (€509 million) will be made available upon completion of
this review. The authorities are treating the arrangement as precautionary. Additional funds
under the program are provided by the European Union and the World Bank (also on a
precautionary basis).
Previous Article IV consultation: The previous consultation was concluded on July 2, 2010
(Country Report No. 10/227).
Data: Romania subscribes to the SDDS; data provision is adequate for surveillance
(Informational Annex).
Political developments: Prime Minister Ponta of the Socialist Democratic Party (PSD) came
to power on May 7, 2012, with the support of the National Liberal Party (PNL), the
Conservative Party, and independent parliamentarians. Parliament voted on July 6 to impeach
President Basescu, but a required referendum held on July 29, 2012 did not achieve sufficient
voter turnout to uphold the impeachment.
Exchange Rate Regime: Romania has accepted the obligations of Article VIII and the
exchange rate system is free of restrictions on current international payments and transfers. The
de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating and the de jure exchange rate
arrangement as managed floating.

I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1.
Significant progress has been made in macroeconomic stabilization under two
successive SBAs but the economic recovery remains fragile. Growth is expected to remain
subdued in the near term and to only gradually recover over the medium term, with risks to the
outlook mostly on the downside. With strong trade and financial sector linkages, Romania is
exposed to the euro area crisis. Fiscal and external reserves provide a buffer and the banking
sector remains well-capitalized. At the same time, the political situation has become more
unsettling with three governments in 2012, uneasy cohabitation between the President and the
governing coalition that has sought to remove him, and parliamentary elections to be held in the
fall. The political uncertainty has contributed to accelerated exchange rate depreciation and
higher financing costs, and has dented confidence.
2.
Romania’s overall track record under the program continues to be good. All
performance criteria for the sixth program review were met except the one on reducing central
government arrears, which was missed by a small margin. All indicative targets, except the
ceiling on the stock of local government arrears, were met. Corrective actions are being taken
to reduce the stock of arrears and prevent accumulation of new arrears. The structural
benchmarks on increasing electricity prices, integrating the accounting reporting system with
the Treasury payment system, and preparing comprehensive amendments to the health care
legislation were met. However, progress on the structural agenda, in particular privatization of
public enterprises, has remained slow. As prior actions for completion of this review, the
government has committed to undertake public offerings of shares in two public enterprises
where preparations are more advanced.
3.
A prudent fiscal and monetary policy stance and decisive implementation of the
structural reform agenda are needed to ensure macroeconomic stability and increase
growth.


Strong fiscal discipline will be needed, especially ahead of the upcoming parliamentary
elections, to meet the fiscal program targets and achieve fiscal sustainability.



The monetary policy stance should lean towards tightening in light of risks to inflation as
well as potential capital outflows and exchange rate pressures.



In the financial sector, where vulnerability to spillovers from euro-area parent banks to
Romanian subsidiaries is high, measures are needed to ensure adequate capital and liquidity
buffers, mitigate the rise in nonperforming loans, and finalize contingency plans.



Pressing ahead with structural reforms, in particular in the energy and transport sectors and of
public enterprises, would provide a much-needed impetus for investment and growth.
Improving EU funds absorption is a priority to unlock significant resources that would help
further real convergence with other European countries.

5
II. CONTEXT: A VULNERABLE RECOVERY
4.
Following the severe downturn during the 2008–09 crisis, Romania has made
significant progress in restoring macroeconomic stability. Large external and fiscal
imbalances were reduced to more sustainable levels under two consecutive IMF SBAs,
supported by the European Union and the World Bank. The current account deficit declined
sharply from 11½ percent of GDP in 2008 to 4½ percent in 2011, and the structural fiscal
deficit narrowed from 7½ percent of GDP to 3 percent over the same period. Annual inflation
dropped from a high of 8 percent at end-2010 to 2 percent in June 2012, partly reflecting the
temporary impact of the good 2011 harvest. Core inflation fell from above 5 percent in 2008 to
about 2 percent recently. The adjustment helped ease financing pressures as spreads narrowed
considerably until the early part of 2012, and renewed access to the Eurobond market together
with support from the EBRD covered fiscal and external financing needs.

Political uncertainty and market stress have increased. Protests against austerity

elections are scheduled for December 9.
Increased risk perception stemming from the overlapping of heightened political uncertainty
with the euro area crisis led to a rise in the sovereign CDS spread for Romania by about
50 basis points since end-April. Yields on interbank loans and treasury bills have also climbed
and the equity market has given up a little more than half of its gains from earlier in the year.
Capital outflows in recent months have precipitated an exchange rate depreciation of about
3½ percent so far this year, compared to 2 percent during 2010–11.
7.
The banking sector is vulnerable to spillovers from the euro area and the weak
economic recovery. The banking system is 80 percent foreign owned (Austrian banks
dominate with 38 percent of system assets and subsidiaries of Greek banks hold about
14 percent of system assets). Compared to regional peers, foreign bank deleveraging has been
moderate thus far. Bank capitalization has remained strong at 14.7 percent at end-June and
funding pressures have been contained with parent banks maintaining their commitments
(partly owing to the European Banking Cooperative Initiative, EBCI) and steady deposit
growth for the system as a whole. However, funding and capitalization have become more
differentiated among banks. Nonperforming loans (NPLs) have risen to almost 17 percent by
end-June 2012, due to the weak economic activity and the vulnerability of un-hedged
borrowers of foreign-currency loans. Provisions at end-June covered 98 percent of the
nonperforming loans.1 Bank profitability remains poor, mainly because of higher provisioning,
and real credit growth has remained subdued amidst private sector deleveraging.
8.
The authorities have incorporated key recommendations from the 2010 Article IV
consultation into their economic programs. The authorities have sustained fiscal
consolidation through continued expenditure reductions, including measures to keep the wage
bill in check. In addition, significant pension reforms have improved the financial soundness of
the public pension system while capital budgeting improvements are ongoing. The authorities
have also implemented some of the advice on structural reforms. In particular, a roadmap for

energy price liberalization was adopted and labor market reforms have introduced more
flexibility in employment relationships, which has contributed to some recovery in employment
rates. However, progress toward reducing the state’s involvement in the energy and
transportation sectors through divestment and improving corporate governance has been
limited.
III. PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION
9.
All performance criteria and indicative targets for end-June were met except for
those for central and local government arrears. Weaker fiscal discipline ahead of the local
government elections and spending pressures in the health care sector resulted in missed arrears
targets for end-June. Central government and social security arrears remained broadly flat
compared to end-March and the performance criterion was missed by a small margin.
However, local government arrears continued to increase and the indicative target was missed
by almost 0.1 percent of GDP. Corrective actions are being taken to reduce arrears as described
in the attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP, ¶5). Inflation
remained within the inner band of the inflation consultation mechanism.
10.
All structural benchmarks set for the review were met. Electricity prices were raised
by five percent to ensure better cost recovery. On the fiscal side, as a further step towards
implementing a commitment control system, a tender was launched for providing software to
integrate the accounting reporting system with the Treasury payment system. A new draft of a
comprehensive health care reform law was prepared and put up for public debate and
consultation with the IMF, the EU, and the World Bank. However, the structural benchmark for
holding initial public offerings (IPOs) of government shares in Hidroelectrica and Romgaz,
scheduled for October, has been postponed to March 2013 pending resolution of the insolvency
procedures for Hidroelectrica and further due diligence work on Romgaz.
IV. OUTLOOK AND RISKS
11.
The macroeconomic outlook for 2012–13 is challenging. Economic activity is
projected to pick up more slowly than previously anticipated while inflation is expected to rise
but remain within the NBR target band.


Staff projects real GDP growth to slow to about 1 percent in 2012, and to gradually
pick up to 2½ percent in 2013, due to diminished confidence, continued low capital
inflows and EU funds absorption, and the slowdown in external demand related to the
euro area recession. Moreover, the recent drought will weaken agricultural output in the
second half of 2012. Unemployment would only slightly decline.



The external current account deficit is projected to narrow to below 4 percent of GDP
in 2012–13 as net capital inflows would remain low and sluggish domestic demand
weakens import growth. Under the baseline scenario, no financing gap is envisaged,
consistent with the program’s precautionary nature.

12.
Growth will remain subdued over the medium term as the output gap narrows
(Box 2). Potential growth is projected to gradually reach 3 percent over the medium term.
Increases in the capital stock and productivity improvements, partly on account of EU funds
absorption and structural reform, would be the main growth drivers in the coming years. The
unemployment rate would moderate to about 6 percent as economic activity picks up and recent
reforms of the labor legislation support employment. Inflation is expected to stabilize within
the new target range of 2.5 +/- 1 percent. The current account deficit would widen to around
4½ percent of GDP over the medium term, consistent with investment needs exceeding national
savings to achieve real convergence over time.

depreciating the currency; bank credit would
fall as deleveraging accelerates; and confidence would plummet, dragging down domestic
demand further. Romania’s sizable gross external financing needs for the second half of 2012
(almost 15 percent of GDP, of which 60 percent is short term) also pose risks. Judging by

10
Romania’s experience in 2008–10, an economic contraction of up to 5 percent could be
possible, notwithstanding existing fiscal and foreign exchange buffers. On the upside, a speedy
normalization of the political situation and acceleration of reforms or a stronger global recovery
could boost market sentiment and activity. Inflation risks are tilted to the upside, including
from higher-than-expected world food prices.2
Box 2. Romania: Medium-Term Growth Potential
Output contracted sharply during the global crisis and is expected to recover only
gradually. In the run up to the crisis, Romania’s growth was driven by structural reforms,
productivity increases, and increasingly by foreign-financed investment. With the onset of the
crisis, the boom came to a halt and unemployment increased. Medium-term growth projections
have been revised down from 4 percent to 3.5 percent due to delays in structural reforms and a
lower-than-expected capacity to absorb EU funds.
Measuring potential output involves a high degree of uncertainty in transition economies
that experienced boom-bust cycles. The Romanian economy underwent substantial structural
changes that spurred an uptake in growth while the declining manufacturing sector pushed
large numbers of workers out of the labor force. Therefore, various techniques were used to
determine the extent to which potential output was scarred by the crisis (based on a HodrickPrescott (HP) filter, a production function (PF) approach and a multivariate (MV) filter; see
Selected Issues Paper, Chapter 1). Estimates of potential output that are based on HP filtering
have known deficiencies related to end-point estimates and ignore relevant information in
structural economic relationships. The MV filter proposed in Benes et al (2010) could serve to
avoid such pitfalls and is chosen as the benchmark model.
The MV filter projects that potential growth will take time to recover and that the output
gap would narrow only gradually. Potential growth is projected to remain below 2 percent
until 2014 and to increase only gradually to 3 percent by 2017. The slow recovery suggests that
the crisis has indeed left lasting scars in the economy. The implied negative output gap is larger
and more persistent than predicted by the HP filter and the PF approach, remaining negative
throughout the projection horizon.

In staff’s view, the mid-year public-sector salary increase is unlikely to have a marked effect on private wages
and inflation. There is little demonstration effect, as it is merely a restoration of past cuts that were not followed in
the private sector. Reductions in public employment also mitigate its effect on the private labor market.

The Risks Assessment Matrix shows events that could materially alter the baseline path discussed in this report
(which is the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of the staff). The relative likelyhood of risks listed is
the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding this baseline. The RAM reflects staff's views on the
source of risks and overall level of concerns as of the time of discussions with the authorities.

12
14.
A severe economic downturn together with a depreciation shock would
significantly weaken banks’ capital buffers. The high dependency of Romanian banks on
parent funding and the high share of foreign-currency lending (about two-thirds of total
credit) expose the banking sector to two major sources of risk: (i) liquidity risks in case
inflows from abroad dry up or deposits are withdrawn; and (ii) foreign-exchange risk through
the banks’ exposure to un-hedged businesses and households. Further deterioration of
economic conditions would also adversely impact asset quality, funding costs and
profitability. A depreciation shock and economic downturn of the magnitude seen in 2008–
09 would significantly weaken banks’ capital buffers. Updated stress tests by the NBR show
that the overall banking system could withstand a deterioration of the economic environment
but some individual banks would be challenged.
V. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Main Challenges
15.
Romania’s main economic challenges are to secure macroeconomic stability and
boost growth. The authorities were aware of the importance of bolstering their credibility in
economic policy making and considered that decisive implementation of their economic
program supported by the IMF, EU, and World Bank would provide a critical anchor to
achieve these goals. In this regard, the main priorities are:


Maintaining strong fiscal discipline to ensure the targeted deficit reduction for 2012–
13, reduce payments arrears, and achieve fiscal sustainability by 2014. A financially
viable health care reform is important to deal with rising aging costs over the longer
term;



Adhering to a prudent monetary policy stance in light of risks to inflation, potential
capital outflows, and exchange rate pressures;



Ensuring that banks have sufficient capital and liquidity while refining contingency
plans to deal with contagion from abroad and mitigating the rise in nonperforming
loans;



Reviving growth and job creation through a more conducive business environment,
far-reaching reforms in the energy and transport sectors, public enterprise reform,
higher absorption of EU funds, and continued implementation of the recent labor
market reform.
B. Achieving Fiscal Sustainability

16.
Romania has undertaken significant fiscal adjustments since 2009. The general
government deficit (ESA terms) has been brought down from 9 percent of GDP in 2009 to
5.2 percent in 2011, and is targeted to reach 3 percent of GDP in 2012, as required under the
EU Excessive Deficit Procedure. This has been achieved largely through expenditure

13
containment, in particular of the public-sector wage bill and pensions. The pro-cyclical
adjustment was needed to halt the rapid increase in the public debt ratio during 2009–10 (to
above 30 percent of GDP) and restore market confidence.

the public sector wage bill will remain at

government has frozen 10 percent of state budget allocations. The authorities are also

7

14
working with the World Bank to prioritize public investment and discontinue low quality
projects (structural benchmark for local government projects). This is important in light of
the relatively high level but low quality of public capital spending in Romania. Given the
interruption of EU fund disbursements for a number of programs, the authorities will slow
down capital outlays, while unspent funds from the PNDI will be saved. The government was
also resolved to firmly resist pressures to relax fiscal discipline ahead of the parliamentary
elections in the fall.
19.
The government is seeking to strengthen tax collections, mainly through
improved administrative measures. Despite high rates for the VAT and social security
contributions, the narrow tax base and weak compliance have reduced revenue yields in
Romania compared to regional peers.

the base for property taxes, and enlarging the tax base in agriculture and for the selfemployed (MEFP ¶14). Administrative measures will also be undertaken, with technical
assistance from the IMF and the World Bank, to improve tax collection (MEFP ¶15). The
authorities agreed that new tax measures such as the possible introduction of a progressive
tax regime will be discussed with the IMF and the EU prior to implementation.

several measures to redress this problem:
1/ Based on preliminary and possibly incomplete data


To introduce a commitment control system, the government continues to work on
integrating the accounting reporting system with the Treasury payment system. A
detailed definition of the structural architecture of the system will be prepared by end2012 (structural benchmark) with the aim of conducting trial runs in 2013.



Arrears at the local government level also reflected unfunded commitments made

15
during the pre-election period, which shows serious shortcomings in the monitoring
and enforcement of the Local Government Public Finance Law (LGPFL). To address
this problem, the authorities will, as a prior action, approve a government ordinance
to ensure that tax-sharing resources available to local governments will be used to
reduce arrears (MEFP ¶11). In addition, the central government, jointly with the
Court of Accounts, will strictly enforce sanctions on local governments that breach
the LGPFL.


In the health sector, arrears at the Health Insurance Fund have been eliminated but
hospital arrears—albeit small in magnitude—remain. The clawback tax will be fully
used to pay down outstanding bills and ensure non-accumulation of arrears in the
pharmaceutical sector. This should also help to prepare for the implementation of the
EU Late Payments Directive in March 2013. The authorities will step up monitoring
of public hospital budget execution and publish up-to-date financial statements of all
public hospitals (structural benchmark). Mandatory financial audits of all public
hospitals will be established and sanctions will be introduced for hospital managers
overspending their budgets. Additional short-term measures for cost control will also
be introduced (MEFP ¶12). However, the implementation of the co-payment law has
been deferred until after the elections to 2013.



For SOEs, the authorities are making progress in reducing arrears in monitored
companies through swap operations, payments, and other financial operations. These
measures should permit arrears of companies under monitoring to be reduced by
RON 4 to 5 billion (three-quarters of a percent of GDP) in the second half of 2012.

21.
The government agreed with the importance of maintaining adequate fiscal
buffers. After some over-financing in the first part of 2012, recent treasury auctions at rising
yields have been below planned levels and fiscal buffers have declined. However, in view of
the considerable downside risks to the outlook, the fiscal buffers should be rebuilt when
possible back to the target of covering at least four months of gross financing needs. To limit
debt service costs and reduce rollover risks, the debt management strategy should seek to
diversify the investor base and continue to develop the yield curve.
22.
The government’s medium-term fiscal strategy envisages some further
consolidation in 2013–14. Following the large fiscal adjustment since 2009, achieving fiscal
sustainability is now within reach.
The government plans to
undertake a structural effort of
½ percent of GDP in 2013–14, in
order to reach the current
Medium-Term Objective (MTO)
of a structural deficit of
0.7 percent of GDP. In staff’s view, with significant pension reforms already underway,
further efforts to address age-related spending pressures should directly target the health

16
sector (MEPF ¶12), rather than aiming for a MTO that is more ambitious than required under
the EU Fiscal Compact (structural deficit below 1 percent of GDP; see Selected Issues Paper,
Chapter 3). In the event of a significant downturn, the government should allow automatic
stabilizers to operate freely. Under such circumstances, it will be important to specify a
credible multi-year consolidation strategy to be implemented once the economy recovers.
23.
Amendments to the fiscal framework are being considered to help cement policy
discipline. The Fiscal Responsibility Law introduced expenditure-based fiscal rules,
established an independent fiscal council and improved budgetary procedures significantly.
To meet the institutional requirements of the EU Fiscal Compact, the authorities are
considering adoption of a fiscal rule on the structural budget balance target as well as of
automatic correction mechanisms in case debt levels exceed certain thresholds. The role of
the independent fiscal council, established in 2010, should also be strengthened.
24.
Entitlement reform remains a key challenge to ensure fiscal sustainability. The
medium-term outlook for fiscal sustainability is favorable by EU standards. Public debt, at
34½ percent of GDP, remains moderate, and is expected to decline to 31 percent of GDP
by 2017 under the baseline scenario. While demographic pressures are significant, the 2010
pension reform has helped address some of these challenges by increasing the statutory
retirement age, limiting pension indexation to inflation, widening the contribution base and
tightening eligibility for early and invalidity pensions. Further action may be needed in the
future to keep the pension age in line with rising life expectancy. In the healthcare sector,
cost pressures remain high and spending is expected to increase by more than one percent of
GDP by 2030. Beyond 2030, age-related spending pressures are expected to accelerate.

Romania, enhance service quality, and address the persistent budgetary shortfalls. Over the
medium and longer term, given that public healthcare spending is among the lowest in the
EU, the reforms seek to ensure adequate financing of the system, while factoring in the costs
of population aging into future spending needs (Box 3).

Box 3. Romania: Addressing the Challenges of the Healthcare System
The Romanian authorities face four major challenges reforming the healthcare system:
(i) eliminating current financial imbalances; (ii) tackling inefficiencies; (iii) improving
healthcare services and health outcomes; and (iv) establishing a long-term sustainable funding
structure.
The government’s draft law contains a number of measures aimed at reducing financial
imbalances, including by establishing the “real cost of treatment” of hospital care. Other
measures include granting hospitals greater autonomy, and introducing a flat-rate co-payment
and vice taxes which can directly benefit the social health insurance fund. On the spending side,
one of the main measures to improve healthcare services would be to establish a strategic
network of state-owned hospitals across the country. The government intends to reduce
inefficiencies by letting mutual healthcare insurers compete on service quality for the newlydefined basic package and negotiate directly with the healthcare providers. The draft law also
envisions that private insurers could offer voluntary insurance supplementing a newly-defined
basic package.
While the draft law appears to go in the right direction in some areas, further measures
are needed to ensure that the government can meet its challenges. For example, the
implications of increased hospital autonomy on the behavior of hospital managers would need to
be analyzed more carefully. The central government should monitor hospitals closely, intervene
if necessary and have bankruptcy procedures in place. The value added of the mutual insurers
would also have to be established clearly. The draft law also does not fully address the challenge
of ensuring long-term financial viability. Measures to do so could include a widening of the
contribution base, raising contribution rates and improving the collection efficiency of general
taxation (see Selected Issues Paper, Chapter 4). Evidence that voluntary supplementary health
insurance can be a major source of revenue is mixed.

C. Preserving Low Inflation with a Flexible Exchange Rate
26.
The monetary easing cycle has ended as exchange rate pressures intensified. The
negative output gap and falling inflation allowed the NBR to reduce its policy rate in four
steps by a cumulative 100 basis points to 5.25 percent over the six-month period to April.
The central bank also stepped up its repo operations, in part to offset intervention in the
foreign exchange market. However, with capital outflows on the rise and increasing domestic
and external uncertainties, the central bank has kept the policy rate constant since May. More
recently, liquidity injections through repo operations have been reduced. Consequently, the

18
interbank rate has increased to close to the policy rate. Nonetheless, the depreciation against
the euro since the beginning of the year had a loosening effect on monetary conditions.

27.
Inflation dynamics and risks of further exchange rate depreciation warrant a
prudent monetary policy stance, supported by a consistent macroeconomic policy mix.
Inflation is expected to rebound towards the upper end of the target band later in the year
with risks tilted to the upside. Also, given that Romania has a history of high inflation,
anchoring inflation expectations will remain a challenge. Moreover, lower capital inflows
and central bank intervention to smooth exchange rate pressures have reduced international
reserves. With these factors in mind, the authorities agreed with the need for a prudent
monetary policy stance, in order to help contain capital outflows and exchange rate
depreciation, and further anchor inflation expectations. The authorities indicated that they
will maintain existing bank reserve requirements, and increase the policy rate if exchange
rate pressures persist. To strengthen the transmission mechanism, the authorities should
continue to build credibility pursue efforts to deepen equity and bond markets, promote financial
sector development, and improve regulatory quality in the economy as a whole. (Box 4).

28.
The NBR should avoid excessive intervention in support of the leu beyond
smoothing exchange rate volatility, allowing for some depreciation as long as inflation is
expected to remain within the target band and balance sheet effects (stemming from the
sizable legacy stock of foreign-currency bank loans to un-hedged borrowers) are manageable.
Amidst a difficult external environment and political uncertainty, maintaining adequate
reserve buffers provides an important cushion against shocks (Box 5). The program target on
net foreign assets of the NBR has been revised downwards to reflect the projected decline in
capital inflows in the wake of the euro crisis and political uncertainty, while ensuring
continued full coverage of short-term debt at remaining maturities.

19
Box 4. Effectiveness of Interest Rate Transmission in Romania
Effective interest rate transmission is crucial for the NBR to signal its monetary policy
stance in a credible manner. Under the current inflation targeting monetary policy
framework, the central bank sets its reference interest rate to signal its policy stance and uses
open market operations to control liquidity in the banking system.
Long-run pass-through of changes in the policy rate to interbank rates has been close to
complete, but impulses are transmitted slowly (see Selected Issues Paper, Chapter 5).
Rolling regressions, using data since August 2005 when the inflation targeting regime was put
into place, suggest that long-run pass-through from the policy rate to money market rates was
initially below 80 percent but has since increased to close to 100 percent. The speed of
transmission also improved but continues to be relatively low, with only about 80 percent of
total pass-through reaching market rates within two months following a policy change.

Pass-through to retail lending rates was initially weak but now compares well to that in
other emerging markets. The findings suggests that pass-through to retail lending rates
reached over 70 percent for the period as a whole, placing Romania above the median for
emerging markets. However, short-run pass-through was low in the early years of inflation
targeting—just above 20 percent—and increased to a moderate 60 percent in recent years.
A more effective transmission mechanism would require a more developed and better
regulated financial system. Based on a structural panel vector auto-regression, staff finds that
countries with effective interest rate transmission have a strong monetary policy mandate, a
good overall economic regulatory environment, and a well developed and healthy financial
system. While the monetary policy framework in Romania is adequate, financial markets
remain shallow compared to most of Romania’s peers, are highly dollarized, and frequently
have excess liquidity.

adequacy metric developed by
Fund staff for emerging markets, which balances the costs and benefits of holding reserves.1/
Romania’s own history suggests taking a prudent stance as international reserves provide
a buffer in an uncertain environment. Prior to the global crisis, international reserves
seemed appropriate by most metrics, but fell short of fully covering short-term debt. During the
period of economic and financial stress, external debt shifted further towards short-term
maturities, exposing the country to capital flight. Since then, maintaining full coverage of
short-term external debt has been a key objective of IMF supported programs. By end-2013,
reserve coverage is expected to decline to a still comfortable 87½ percent as large Fund
repayments come due.

_________________________
1/ The new reserve adequacy metric is constructed based on the empirically observed relative riskiness
of different potential drains on reserves and the amount of liquid reserve assets that should be held
against each of these risk factors based on past crisis experience across countries. See IMF (2011)

D. Maintaining Medium-Term External Sustainability
29.
Staff’s exchange rate assessment
indicates that the currency is broadly in
line with fundamentals. The CGER external
sustainability and macroeconomic balance
approaches suggest a marginal
undervaluation of the exchange rate of
around ½ to 1 percent, while the equilibrium
real exchange rate approach suggests a
slightly higher undervaluation of about

4¾ percent, which is within the margin of error. In addition, competitiveness has improved
with the REER depreciating by 8 percent as of end-June 2012 (y-o-y) and Romania continues
to gain export market share in the EU. However, structural conditions continue holding back
external competitiveness (see Selected Issues Paper, Chapter 7).
30.
The external debt sustainability analysis indicates that the projected current
account deficits are sustainable. Gross external debt stood at 73 percent of GDP at endJune 2012, one-third of which was public debt. Around one-fifth of external debt is at shortterm maturities, mainly of the non-bank private sector. The projected medium-term current
account deficit of 4½ percent of GDP is in line with a declining external debt-to-GDP ratio.
Bound tests indicate that 30 percent depreciation would substantially increase the external
debt-to-GDP ratio over the medium-term, while other standard shocks would only lead to a
slower decline in the external debt ratio.

medium term. The projected medium-term current EBCI Parent Funding Exposure to Romania

projected with a significant discount relative to precrisis levels. Medium-term FDI inflows are consistent with recent experience and do not
include potential inflows from the privatization agenda. In addition, official current transfers
are conservatively estimated as utilization of EU Funds allocated to Romania has remained
low. Thus, there is significant upside to FDI inflows and official transfers if the privatization
efforts materialize and Romania manages to better absorb EU funds.
32.
Further progress in structural reform is needed to prepare for eventual euro
adoption. The authorities’ stated objective is to join the euro area in 2015, but they view the
target date more as a lever for reform to boost economic flexibility and productivity than as a
strict deadline. The authorities were aware that the timetable for adopting the euro should
take into account that entry into the euro area takes away the exchange rate as an important
adjustment tool in the face of shocks or competitiveness pressures. Given the need for further
structural reforms and improvements in public sector operations to prepare for euro adoption,
the authorities were resolved to focus on implementing their economic program.

22
E. Developing a Resilient Banking System
33.
Financial sector developments in Europe pose challenges to Romania’s banking
system through several channels. Romania’s asset markets and spreads tend to co-move
closely with its regional peers and have been strongly impacted by both the 2008 financial
crisis and the intensification of the euro area crisis (see Selected Issues Paper, Chapter 6).
Increases in Romania’s CDS and EMBIG spreads directly impact bank financing costs. The
banks are also exposed to funding risk as deleveraging takes hold. The significant presence
of Greek banks heightens these risks further.
34.
A gradual parent funding retrenchment and fragmentation of interbank
markets have led to a deterioration of bank liquidity for some banks. Compared to
regional peers, foreign-owned bank deleveraging has been orderly and moderate so far
(Box 6). Nevertheless, interbank markets are fragmented due to perceived counterparty risk,
and some banks with strained liquidity have been offering above-average deposit rates to
compensate for lower parent funding. Greek banks continue to have limited access to
interbank funding and rely primarily on parents and swap markets as foreign exchange
sources. To help reduce interbank market fragmentation, the NBR is preparing measures to
enable banks to engage in collateralized interbank lending.

corporates are more constrained in obtaining credit

banking system is broadly resilient to further economic deterioration and exchange rate
depreciation, a few banks would be challenged in case of large collateral price declines,
shrinking net interest rate margins and higher interest rates.

Box 6. Foreign Bank Deleveraging in Romania
The risk of disruptive parent funding withdrawals by European banks from Central and
Southeastern Europe (CESEE) has been a longstanding concern. Some orderly deleveraging,
however, is unavoidable given past excessive credit booms and European banks’ decision to shrink
non-core assets over time. However, disorderly foreign bank deleveraging could lead to a credit
crunch with spillovers to the real economy.
Compared to regional peers, foreign bank deleveraging has been moderate so far, partly due
to the EBCI. In July, the total exposure to Romania of the nine largest foreign banks that
participated in the EBCI fell to 94 percent (against March 2009 exposure) from 101.3 percent at
end-2011, notably due to reduced exposure to non-financial institutions. Exposure of parent banks
to their subsidiaries has remained at a similar level between March 2009 and July 2012.
Overall bank system parent funding has been orderly, declining moderately since end-2011.
At end-July, it stood at 89.2 percent of the end-2011 level. The decline in overall sector exposure of
BIS reporting banks to Romania has been in the average for the CESEE (excl. Russia and Turkey)
with a 20 percent deleveraging ($13.4bn) between 2008:Q3 and 2012:Q1, much less than in
Ukraine (52.8 percent), Latvia (38.3 percent) or

banks’ parent funding (close to 70 percent) has a
maturity of over one year, preventing an abrupt withdrawal.
Deleveraging has been driven by different factors. Some causes for the orderly foreign bank
deleveraging in Romania were weak parent banks (especially Greek banks), changes in parent
funding strategy (e.g., some French banks) or some loss in domestic funding (e.g., Greek
subsidiaries). If the overall financial sector environment were to further deteriorate, including with
further rising NPLs and continued poor profitability, some parents could scale back long-term
support for their subsidiaries, thus making them more reliant on domestic funding.

shareholder support and retained earnings, the capitalization of the banking sector
remained strong at 14.7 percent at end-June, akin to regional levels, albeit with some
differences between banks. All banks except one have a capital ratio above the regulatory
minimum of 10 percent.4 Greek banks continue to exhibit capital buffers exceeding the
system average, inter alia owing to capital injections from parent banks. The introduction of
IFRS provisioning in early 2012 has gone smoothly. The maintenance of a prudential filter
and pro-active bank supervision has ensured that a prudent provisioning regime remains in
place.

4

The bank supervisor is undertaking intensive supervision in this case.

24
37.
The authorities have introduced several regulatory and legislative changes that aim
at safeguarding financial stability. The NBR adopted measures in 2011 to restrict foreigncurrency lending to un-hedged household borrowers. The NBR has continued to closely oversee
bank practices to avoid ever-greening so as to ensure that IFRS loan-loss provisioning and
collateral valuations as well as the assessment of credit risk of restructured loans remain prudent
and in line with good international practices. In June 2012, the fiscal code was amended to
ensure a neutral tax treatment of bank receivables sold to Romanian firms, in order to enable
banks to improve their balance sheet management. In addition, rigidities in insolvency and
foreclosure procedures should be removed, including by implementing the forthcoming
recommendations of the World Bank Report on Standards and Codes on insolvency and creditor
rights.
38.
The authorities have continued to strengthen their crisis management arrangements
and contingency planning. In January 2012, amendments to the bank resolution legislation
were adopted that introduce bridge bank and other resolution powers for dealing with failing
banks. The NBR is finalizing the regulation on the authorization of the bridge bank and internal
procedures for these newly-introduced bank resolution measures. The NBR, Deposit Guarantee
Fund (DGF), and Ministry of Public Finance (MOPF) continue to coordinate the implementation
of operational preparedness plans.5 The NBR and the DGF signed a Memorandum of
Understanding that ensures the DGF will be given sufficient information on potential problem
institutions early enough to enable it to meet its obligations effectively.
VI. MEDIUM-TERM PERSPECTIVE: FOSTERING HIGHER AND INCLUSIVE GROWTH
39.
Convergence to EU standards of living has nearly stalled since the onset of the 2008–
09 financial crisis. Over the decade preceding the crisis, strong productivity gains fuelled by a
credit-led investment boom and prospective EU entry enabled Romania to reach nearly half the
EU average per-capita income level. This increase occurred despite significant labor shedding
during the transition. Labor utilization has remained fairly stagnant since then, likely reflecting
rigid labor markets, demographic changes, and the large informal economy. Little progress in
closing the income gap was made in recent years.

5

The deposit coverage ratio target of banks’ contributions to the DGF has been raised, a DGF resolution fund has
been set up, and a contingent funding line with the MOPF has been established.

Romania remains one of the least economically developed members of the EU.
Poverty rates are higher, the healthcare and education systems are underfunded and of relatively
low quality, and convergence with EU norms lags other emerging European countries. Over the
last two years, the authorities have started to address some of the causes for these poor outcomes
through key pension and labor market reforms as well as measures to improve the regulatory and
pricing framework for the energy sector. Nonetheless, since 2010, Romania has fallen behind
other countries in terms of perceptions of corruption, ease of doing business, and global
competitiveness.

41.
The authorities agreed that unlocking a higher and inclusive growth potential will
require decisive implementation of their ambitious reform agenda. To address the significant
reform gaps, action should be taken to improve the business environment, reform the energy and
transport sectors, re-invigorate public enterprise reform, and drastically upgrade the capacity to
absorb EU funds. Reforms to improve education outcomes and increase employment rates as
well as measures to protect the most vulnerable will be important.
42.
A stable and predictable business environment is prerequisite to attracting more
investment. In order to provide potential investors a clear perspective on their future rights and
obligations, ad hoc changes in the legislation should be avoided as much as possible. Thorough
preparation of new laws through consultation with all stakeholders and impact analyses would
help to stabilize the legal and regulatory framework, and avoid unintended consequences. Better
access to impartial and timely justice is needed to guarantee that the law applies to all and to
limit costly distortions. There also remains ample scope to improve the transparency of

26
government operations, including in procurement. Reducing the turnover in key government
agencies and basing their staffing exclusively on professional qualifications would allow for
building up experience and upgrading service provision. An effective use of the anti-money
laundering framework would help detect and deter corruption, in particular by requiring financial
and non-financial institutions to extend due diligence to customers who are domestic politically
exposed persons and by strengthening cooperation between competent authorities.

inefficient state-owned enterprises (SOEs). Estimates of investment needs run into the tens of
billions of dollars over the next decade in the energy sector alone. In the transportation sector,
there remains a strong need to cut costs and improve service provision, while increasing the
efficiency of public investments in the rail and road network.
44.
Under the current program, the authorities have taken a number of actions to
establish a framework to improve the efficiency of the energy sector. In June, Parliament
approved legislation to bring Romania into compliance with EU energy directives.6 The
government has also approved roadmaps to deregulate electricity and gas prices that envisage
full liberalization over the coming years. Regulated electricity prices have been increased by
five percent at end-June (structural benchmark) and another ad-hoc increase is scheduled for gas
prices (prior action). Moreover, the authorities have cancelled or renegotiated all bilateral
contracts that obligated the hydro-electric power producer (Hidroelectrica) to sell electricity at
below market prices. The electricity for cancelled contracts will now be sold on the open market.
45.
Steadfast implementation of the regulatory and price reforms over the medium
term is key. Legislation has been submitted to parliament to restore the independence of the
energy regulator (ANRE). The effective implementation of the gas and electricity roadmaps will
require the pass through of price increases to end-users and measures to protect vulnerable

consumers. A package of tax and regulatory measures, in consultation with gas and electricity
sector stakeholders, is being prepared that will include a windfall levy to help finance the social
protection measures. In the transportation sector, a better balance needs to be struck between the
availability of subsidies and the public service obligations of the rail passenger company.

transportation and storage sectors, the slow progress in
restructuring inefficient SOEs severely hampers investment and growth.
47.
The success of SOE reform in boosting Romania’s growth potential and enhancing
its competitiveness will require the government to act as a responsible shareholder. This
would entail a number of actions (see the Selected Issues Paper, Chapter 2): (i) implement the
provisions of the SOE corporate governance law passed last year, including the appointment of
professional boards and managers; (ii) promote transparency through the regular publication of
comprehensive reports on SOE performance, as is done in other European countries; and (iii) use
privatization more aggressively to gain technical and managerial expertise, attract financing for
investment, and reduce the fiscal risk of SOEs.
48.
The authorities were resolved to accelerate SOE reform going forward. To jump start
the privatization agenda, the government has decided to launch the tenders for a secondary
public offering in the state-owned gas transmission operator (Transgaz) and the sale of the
remaining state’s interest in a chemical company (Oltchim) as prior actions for completion of the
review. It was also committed to pressing ahead with several other priority privatizations and
intends to hold an initial public offering of part of its shares in Hidroelectica once the company
exits insolvency (MEFP ¶31–32). The authorities will also continue to introduce professional
management in a number of SOEs (MEFP ¶27–29)
C. EU Funds Absorption

The process for absorbing EU funds continues to be plagued by difficulties.
Romania ranks worst among all new EU member states in using structural funds with an
absorption rate of around half the regional average. While this partly reflects its later entry into

incentives at all involved authorities.

The government put in place a new Social Dialogue Law to reform the collective
bargaining process and ensure that wage developments will be more in line with
productivity growth at firm level. The authorities are monitoring implementation of the
Social Dialogue Law and will ensure that any amendments will be undertaken in
consultation with all stakeholders without introducing undue rigidities in the collective
bargaining process. They will also continue cooperation with the International Labor
Organization (ILO), in order to ensure that the new legislation is consistent with core ILO
conventions.



The new Social Assistance Law is an important step in streamlining social benefits and
improving targeting. Secondary legislation is currently being prepared. The authorities
will ensure that the newly designed social assistance law is fully effective by
January 2013, before energy price liberalization commences for households.

In view of the low labor participation rate in Romania and the high unemployment
among youth and older workers, the authorities are currently assessing possible measures
to increase the employment rate. They agreed with staff on the need to carefully assess
the impact of possible measures, including tax policy options aimed at reducing the labor
wedge, actions to strengthen incentives for workers to enter and remain in the labor force,
and efforts to enhance job search assistance and training.

VII. PROGRAM MODALITIES AND OTHER ISSUES
51.
The attached Letter of Intent (LOI) and MEFP describe the authorities’ progress in
implementing their economic program and set out their commitments through midJanuary 2013. Some modifications to the program’s conditionality are proposed (Tables 1–2):

• Four prior actions are proposed (Table 2). The prior actions are: (i) approve government
ordinance to allow that: (a) resources available to local governments, currently limited to
co-financing investment, can be used for paying arrears, and (b) the central government
can directly pay off arrears of local governments from shared taxes; (ii) increase gas
prices for non-residential consumers by 10 percent and for households by 5 percent;
(iii) launch the tender for a secondary public offering of 15 percent of Transgaz shares;
and (iv) launch the tender for the majority privatization of Oltchim.


Modifications to the end- September targets are proposed. The NFA target for endSeptember 2012 was lowered due to lower-than-projected capital inflows. An adjustor for

30
general government capital spending has been introduced for end-September, at a level
lower than the adjustor currently in place for end-June in order to allow a smoother path
of capital spending over the year.


Four new structural benchmarks are proposed (Table 2): (i) update the investment
database to identify priority local government projects funded through budgetary and EU
funds, and publish a list of low priority projects which will be discontinued; (ii) publish
up-to-date financial statements of all public hospitals on a webpage of the Ministry of
Health; (iii) sign a contract with a legal and transaction advisor for the majority
privatization of Oltenia; and (iv) finalize a detailed definition of the structural
architecture of the accounting and treasury reporting system.

52.
Program modalities. Romania is not expected to face actual balance of payments
financing needs in 2012 under the baseline scenario. The Stand-By Arrangement as well as
financing commitments from the European Union and the World Bank will continue to be treated
as precautionary.

Program risks. Romania’s capacity to repay the Fund is expected to remain strong. Fund
credit outstanding is expected to decline from 40.7 percent of gross reserves in 2012. Peak
payments would be in 2013 and 2014 at a still manageable 16.3 percent and 15.8 percent of gross
reserves, or 9.5 percent and 8.3 percent of exports of goods and services, respectively. While this
exposure is large, servicing risks are mitigated by the relatively low level of public debt. Public
indebtedness (including guarantees) is expected to remain under 35 percent of GDP, with public
external debt peaking at around 24 percent of GDP in 2012. Total external debt was 72.1 percent
of GDP in 2011 and is projected to decline over the medium-term. In addition, an update in 2011
of the 2009 safeguards assessment found a robust safeguards framework at the NBR, while
recommending measures to sustain NFA reporting standards and effective audit oversight, and
enhance accounting disclosures.
VIII. STAFF APPRAISAL
54.
Economic activity is expected to remain subdued in the near term due to reduced
confidence and weakened trade and capital flows from political uncertainty and the recession in
Europe; continued difficulties in absorbing EU-funds; and the impact of the drought on
agriculture. Annual headline inflation would pick up in coming months towards the upper level
of the inflation band by year-end due to rising food prices and pass-through from the
depreciation. The external current account deficit is expected to narrow further in 2012 and, in
light of the sluggish recovery, to widen only slightly over the medium term. Risks to the outlook
are mostly on the downside.
55.
Strict fiscal discipline is needed, ahead of parliamentary elections in the fall, to
achieve the fiscal targets for 2012. Although the sizable deficit reduction implies a pro-cyclical
stance, it is critical to bolster market confidence and exit the EU Excessive Deficit Procedure.

31
Staff welcomes the significant progress made in containing the public sector wage bill.
Continued restraint is needed to discontinue low-priority spending while pressures to reduce tax
rates ahead of the elections should be firmly resisted. Controlling government and healthcare
sector arrears is a priority. If a significant worsening of the euro area crisis was to occur and
result in a sharp contraction of economic activity in Romania, the government should let the
automatic stabilizers act freely. Under such circumstances, it will be important to specify a
credible multi-year consolidation strategy to be implemented once the economy recovers. To
guard against this risk, it is important to maintain adequate fiscal buffers.
56.
Prudent fiscal policies over the medium term must be maintained and putting in
place the institutional framework required under the EU Fiscal Compact would strengthen
fiscal discipline and policymaking. Following the large fiscal adjustment since 2009, achieving
fiscal sustainability in the coming years is now within reach and the government should follow
through on its commitment to achieve a structural deficit of less than 1 percent of GDP by 2014.
Staff welcomes the focus beyond 2012 on targeting the structural balance which allows fiscal
policy to play a stabilizing role over the economic cycle.
57.
Further entitlement reforms should be undertaken to deal with rising aging costs
and improve service delivery in healthcare. The 2010 pension reform is already helping to
address this challenge but further action may be needed in the future to keep the pension age in
line with rising life expectancy. In the health care system, the public consultation on draft
legislation is a welcome first step to prepare for an overhaul of the benefits package and
financing mechanisms. Before moving this process further, an impact analysis should be
undertaken to ensure the financial sustainability of the planned reform. In light of the low level
of public health care spending in Romania, there is a strong need to mobilize adequate financing
to improve service delivery and to better contain costs.
58.
A prudent monetary policy stance while maintaining exchange rate flexibility is
warranted going forward. The central bank has appropriately refrained from further monetary
policy easing in recent months in light of lower net capital inflows and exchange rate
depreciation. Inflation risks are tilted to the upside, including from higher-than-expected world
food prices. Exchange rate flexibility and retaining adequate international reserves buffers
provide an important cushion against external shocks. The NBR should avoid excessive
intervention in support of the leu, allowing for some further depreciation as long as inflation
remains within the target band and bank balance sheets effects are manageable. The monetary
policy stance should be tightened if exchange rate pressures persist. To help reduce interbank
market fragmentation, the NBR should facilitate collateralized interbank lending.
59.
In light of the uncertain environment and spillover risks from the euro area, it is
important that the NBR continues its intensive bank supervision and further elaborates its
crisis preparedness. Staff welcomes the pro-active supervision practices in place. Any
necessary measures should be taken to ensure that banks have sufficient capital and liquidity. It
is equally important that the NBR, in coordination with other relevant authorities, stands ready to

32
implement its crisis management framework and updates detailed contingency plans on an
ongoing basis.
60.
Further action is needed to mitigate the rise in nonperforming loans. Provisions
almost fully cover nonperforming loans but profitability is poor, mainly because of the persistent
need for higher provisioning. Staff welcomes the recent amendment to the fiscal code that
ensures a neutral tax treatment of bank receivables sold to asset-recovery firms. In addition, the
authorities should swiftly implement the forthcoming recommendations of the World Bank
Report on Standards and Codes on insolvency and creditor rights. Banks should be able to write
off fully provisioned NPLs.
61.
Decisive implementation of the structural reform agenda is crucial to accelerate
convergence with other EU countries. The key priorities are to improve the business climate,
modernize the energy and transport sectors, re-invigorate public enterprise reform, boost EU
funds absorption, and further improve the functioning of the labor market. Accelerating progress
in these areas is critical to fostering higher and inclusive growth.
62.
Reform of the energy and transportation sectors and of public enterprises is
indispensable to help boost Romania’s long-term growth potential. Determined
implementation of the realignment of gas and electricity end-user prices with costs is crucial to
stimulate energy efficiency; unlock the large investments needed to expand domestic production
and improve delivery systems; and increase resources available for social spending and
investment in infrastructure. At the same time, targeted social assistance should be put in place to
protect vulnerable households from the impact of the necessary price adjustments. Major efforts
are needed to improve the efficiency of public investments in the rail and road network.
Corporate governance in public enterprises must be significantly improved and the envisaged
privatization of public enterprises needs to be followed through, in order to attract capital to
finance new investments and facilitate technology transfers.
63.
Building on the recent reform of the labor market legislation, efforts should now
turn to raising the employment rate. It is important to ensure that the new Labor Code and
Social Dialogue Laware consistent with core ILO conventions, while efforts to undo the progress
made should be firmly resisted. Staff welcomes the government’s intention to address the low
labor force participation in Romania and the high unemployment of younger and older workers.
64.
On the basis of Romania’s performance under the SBA, staff supports the
authorities’ request for completing the sixth review. Staff also supports the approval of a
waiver of nonobservance of the end-June 2012 performance criterion on the accumulation of
central government’s arrears given the small size of the deviation and the corrective actions
undertaken by the government. Staff recommends establishment of quantitative conditionality
for end-December 2012, and approval of the modification of program conditionality, as proposed
in the attached Letter of Intent.

33
65.
Decisive implementation of the IMF-supported program is important to foster
confidence and facilitate private capital flows. The precautionary SBA, together with the
financing commitments from the European Union and the World Bank, provides an important
buffer against possible future shocks, while assisting Romania in continuing its economic
adjustment. When the current SBA expires in March next year, any potential future program
engagement with the Fund will depend on the overall track-record under the present program and
the external environment.
66.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on a 24-month cycle,
subject to the decision on consultation cycles in program countries.

1/ Coverage: general government gross debt, including guarantees.
2/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; a = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels of the last projection year.

Appendix I. Romania: Letter of Intent
Bucharest, September 12, 2012
Mme. Christine Lagarde
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, DC 20431
U.S.A.
Dear Mme. Lagarde:
1.
The Romanian authorities reaffirm our commitment to our economic program
supported by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the European Union (EU), and the
World Bank (WB). Implementation of the program was good in most areas, but the broader
structural reform agenda continues to progress slowly. We met all but one performance
criteria for the sixth program review. We are committed to the additional actions described in
the attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP), including the
acceleration of structural reforms. We expect growth to remain subdued this year, after the
economy contracted in the last quarter of 2011 and the first quarter of 2012. The recovery
remains vulnerable to difficulties in international financial markets, which require continued
firm policy implementation and maintenance of fiscal, monetary, and financial sector buffers
to safeguard against risks.
2.
Our performance on the quantitative targets and structural reform agenda for the fifth
review has been good (MEFP, Tables 1 and 2).
Quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets. All but one end-June 2012
quantitative performance criteria were observed. The performance criterion (PC) on
central government arrears was missed by a small margin. All indicative targets,
except the ceiling on the stock of local government arrears, were met. Corrective
actions are being taken to reduce arrears as described in the attached MEFP (¶5).
Inflation remained within the inner band of the inflation consultation mechanism.
Structural benchmarks. We met all the structural benchmarks for June 30, 2012. We
increased electricity prices by five percent, launched a tender for providing software to
integrate the accounting reporting system with the Treasury payment system, and
prepared comprehensive amendments to the health care legislation. We continue to
improve the health care amendments as part of the consultation process with the IMF,
the EU, and the WB.

In the attached MEFP, we set out our plans to further advance towards meeting the
objectives of our macroeconomic program. In view of our performance under the program
supported by the IMF, the EU, and the World Bank and proposed remedial measures, the
Government of Romania and the National Bank of Romania (NBR) request a waiver on the
missed performance criterion and completion of the sixth review. We intend to continue to
treat the arrangement as precautionary.
4.
The program will continue to be monitored through quarterly reviews, prior actions,
quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets, as well as structural benchmarks. We
propose a modification of the September 30, 2012 quantitative performance criteria and the
establishment of such criteria for December 31, 2012, as set out in the attached MEFP. The
modification consists of a downward revision to the performance criterion on Net Foreign
Assets (as described in the Technical Memorandum of Understanding, TMU) due to lower
net capital inflows. As detailed in the MEFP, we propose four new structural benchmarks and
four prior actions against which to measure progress under the program (MEFP, Table 2).
We also request that the structural benchmark on holding of IPOs of government shares in
Romgaz and Hidroelectrica to be reset from October 15, 2012, to March 15, 2013. The TMU
explains how program targets are measured.
5.
We believe that the policies set forth in the letters of March 10, 2011, June 9, 2011,
September 14, 2011, December 2, 2011, February 28, 2012, June 8, 2012, and in this Letter
are adequate to achieve the objectives of our economic program. We stand ready to take
additional measures as appropriate to ensure achievement of these objectives. We will
consult with the IMF and European Commission (EC) before modifying measures contained
in this Letter and the attached MEFP or adopting new measures that would deviate from the
goals of the program, and will provide the IMF and the EC with the necessary information
for program monitoring.
6.
We authorize the IMF and the EC to publish the Letter of Intent and its attachments,
and the related staff reports. This letter is being copied to Mr. Olli Rehn.
Sincerely,

Attachment I. Romania: Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies
Recent Economic Developments and Outlook
1.
Two consecutive quarterly declines in economic activity (q/q) point to a stronger
growth slowdown than previously expected. Real GDP grew by 2½ percent in 2011 on the
back of a very good harvest, a modest recovery in private demand supported by export
growth. However, real GDP declined by 0.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2011 (q/q) and
by 0.1 percent in the first quarter of 2012 (q/q) as economic activity slowed and adverse
weather conditions dampened domestic demand. Preliminary data indicate that second
quarter growth will be positive on account of strong retail sales and construction activity.
Headline inflation fell to 2 percent in June on account of food price declines from the high
levels of a year ago and phasing out of base effects related to earlier VAT rate increases.
Annual inflation jumped to 3 percent in July, reflecting the anticipated reversal of base
effects and pass through of the exchange rate depreciation. Core inflation in July remained
close to 2 percent reflecting the sizeable output gap and the prudent monetary policy stance.
2.
We expect growth for the year as a whole to be subdued at around 1 percent. Growth
is likely to slow more than previously anticipated as weak external demand and the impact of
the recent drought weigh on economic activity. Moreover, the absorption of EU funds is
likely to be lower than expected earlier in the year. Inflation should stay within the central
bank’s target band, although it will temporarily increase towards the upper end of the band in
the third quarter due to rising food prices and reversal of base effects. The current account
deficit is expected not to exceed 4 percent of GDP for 2012, reflecting a faster slowdown in
import growth compared to exports. Risks to economic activity continue to be tilted to the
downside, particularly from developments in international financial markets, lower-thanexpected EU funds absorption, the impact of the drought, and increased political uncertainty.
Firm policy implementation will thus be crucial in building confidence and securing policy
buffers.
Fiscal Policy
3.
In the second quarter of 2012, we met our fiscal deficit target. Tax revenues overperformed slightly, reflecting a gradual recovery in wages and enhanced tax collection
efforts, while nontax revenues recovered due to dividends from state-owned enterprises
(SOEs). Overall spending was below projections as we maintained strict control over current
spending, with a continued decline in public employment. Some resources were reallocated
to higher capital spending and co-financing for EU-funded projects, while the execution of
National Development and Infrastructure Program (PNDI) projects was contained. However,
the arrears targets for the general government were missed. Arrears of the local governments
continued to increase, while arrears of the central government were unchanged.

60
4.
For 2012, we remain fully committed to bringing the fiscal deficit in ESA terms
below 3 percent of GDP, in compliance with our commitment under the EU Excessive
Deficit Procedure. For 2013, we will reduce the structural deficit by at least 0.5 percent of
GDP. To ensure meeting our goal for 2012, we will limit the cash deficit target to 2.2 percent
of GDP, which entails a consolidation of some 2 percent of GDP in structural terms.
Achieving this target will require continued expenditure restraint and strengthened tax
collection efforts. We have already taken measures to protect against possible adverse
developments by freezing 10 percent of state budget allocations. The public sector wage bill
will remain at 6.7 percent of GDP, as in 2011. In light of the interruption of EU fund
reimbursements for a number of programs, capital outlays, including for co-financing of EUfunded projects, will need to slow down to remain within the budgetary envelope. Cofinancing of EU-funded projects from the privatization fund will not be undertaken and any
unspent funds from the PNDI will be saved. Pressures to relax fiscal discipline ahead of
parliamentary elections in the fall will be firmly resisted. We will undertake measures to
ensure strict discipline of local government finances and a reduction of arrears.
5.
After a year of declining arrears and unpaid bills in the general government
(excluding SOEs), arrears have increased again since early 2012, causing program targets to
be missed for both the central and local governments. Government arrears increased by RON
205 million since March 2012 and now stand at around 0.2 percent of GDP (concentrated
mostly in local governments). In SOEs monitored under the program, arrears in the second
quarter of 2012 stood at 3.3 percent of GDP, below the indicative program ceiling.


We are making progress in the integration of the accounting reporting system with the
Treasury payment system, including the commitment control and reporting module
for all levels of government. We launched a tender for the software provider for the
system. We will select the consultant by mid-October 2012 and finalize a detailed
definition of the structure architecture of the system by end- December 2012
(structural benchmark). This system will help control spending commitments to avoid
future arrears.



Rising arrears at the local government level are a key challenge. These arrears reflect
late payments for current spending such as on utilities, especially among smaller local
government administration units with limited own revenues. The increase in arrears
also reflects unfunded commitments made during the pre-election period, which
shows serious shortcomings in the monitoring and enforcement of the Local
Government Public Finance Law (LGPFL). To strengthen enforcement, we have
conducted a thorough audit of the use made of the allocated additional transfers from
the central government for arrears reduction and will undertake a comprehensive
analysis of local government arrears to determine their causes and the entities to
which the arrears are owed. We will approve a government ordinance to: (i) ensure
that tax-sharing resources available to local governments, currently limited to cofinancing investment can be used for paying arrears; and (ii) allow the central

61
government to directly pay off arrears of local government from shared taxes (prior
action). Accordingly, the central government will begin to pay off local government
arrears from September and will jointly with the Court of Accounts strictly enforce
sanctions on local governments that breach the LGPFL. We will also seek technical
assistance to improve insolvency procedures for local governments. We will submit
by September 15 a report on the distribution of local government arrears across local
authorities, its sources, the progress made in clearing these arrears, and the status of
enforcement activities undertaken.


In the health sector, arrears in registered bills have now been eliminated. The
clawback tax has yielded RON 716 million in the first half of 2012, which will be
fully used to pay down outstanding bills. We have updated the formula of the clawback tax with the pharmaceutical industry. All revenues from the clawback tax will be
used to reduce payment periods and ensure non-accumulation of arrears in the
pharmaceutical sector. In preparation of the implementation of the EU Late Payments
Directive, which will become effective as of March 2013, we will identify measures
to cover the fiscal needs arising from the timely payment of unpaid bills.



For SOEs, we are making progress in reducing arrears in monitored companies
through swap operations, payments, and other financial operations. We anticipate that
these measures will permit arrears of companies under monitoring to be reduced by
RON 4 to 5 billion (three-quarters of a percent of GDP) in the second half of 2012.

6.
To address health sector financial imbalances in 2012-13, we are committed to
implementing the following key measures:


We adopted the revised co-payment formula on July 18, 2012. The new formula is
based on a modest fixed amount depending on services provided but independent of
income, and copayments will be implemented as of January 1, 2013. Emergency
services are excluded from the co-payment law.



To control expenditures and ensure efficiency gains in the short term, we will
continue to revise and implement the negative list of health services and drugs, and
have agreed with health service providers to reduce hospitalization periods. The
national hospital bed plan, which established the number of hospital beds that can be
contracted in 2012 with health insurance houses in every county, is being
implemented through Ministry of Health Order No 1577/2011. We will not introduce
any new drugs or indications in the list of compensated drugs without an interim
health technology assessment (HTA). To this end, we will elaborate an interim HTA
based on objective and quantifiable criteria by end-October 2012. We will continue to
encourage generics where possible in the list of compensated and free drugs and
pharmacies will be required to better inform their clients of available products. In
addition, we will improve the procurement system for hospitals, in particular by

62
centralizing tenders.


We will continue to monitor public hospital budgets to ensure that they are consistent
with the expenditure programmed in the general government budget. We will publish
up-to-date financial statements of all public hospitals on a web page of the Ministry
of Health by end-October 2012 (structural benchmark). Moreover, we will establish
mandatory financial audits of all public hospitals (under national or local
governments) and financial audits of the use of public funds, and introduce sanctions
for hospital managers overspending their available budgets.



We will continue implementation of a new healthcare IT system. We have initiated
the auditing of patient registries, which will be completed by end-2012. The contract
for the production of patient cards and for the IT system was signed and we began
distributing electronic health cards in August. This will help control fraud and abuse
in the system while enabling better monitoring of spending commitments. A new
electronic prescription module for the National Health Information System became
operational in June 2012. Efforts are ongoing under an EU-funded project to build a
central data base with electronic health records, which is expected to be in place by
mid-2013.

7.
We continue our efforts to prepare and implement a comprehensive reform of the
healthcare system. We published a revised draft of a new framework law in June (structural
benchmark), with public debate between July and October before submitting the law to
Parliament by the end-2012. We will publish impact assessments of the reform options
before parliamentary discussion and also provide a timetable for the implementation of
subsequent legislation. The reform will aim to raise the efficiency of healthcare spending in
Romania, enhance service quality, and address the persistent budgetary shortfalls. Over the
medium and longer term, given that public healthcare spending is among the lowest in the
EU, we will ensure adequate financing of the system, while factoring in the costs of
population ageing into future spending needs. To contain the growth of public spending, we
will seek to reduce the scope of the public benefits package through greater reliance on costsharing and private supplementary insurance. On the revenue side we will explore options to
broaden the contribution base to the social health insurance scheme and, if necessary, to raise
contribution rates.
8.
In July 2012, we enacted measures to streamline the tax system, building on
recommendations of IMF technical assistance. These measures aim to: (i) simplify the
declaration and payment of taxes on capital gains by changing to a system based on
withholding of advance payments made by intermediaries (brokers) and a single statement
filed by the taxpayer at the end of the year; and (ii) provide a neutral tax treatment for the
sale of bank receivables to Romanian companies. In addition, we will introduce from
January 2013 further measures aimed at: (i) simplifying the depreciation schedules for fixed
assets; (ii) revising the base for property taxes, which will vary depending on use of the

63
property and not the legal status of the property owner, and options for property tax
collection; and (iii) moving VAT collection onto a cash accounting basis for companies with
annual turnover below EUR 500,000. From September 1, we will increase tax deductibility
for research and development expenditures from 20 percent to 50 percent. We also intend to
enlarge the tax base in agriculture and for the self-employed, and to assess the effects on
employment and the public finances of tax policy options aimed at reducing the number of
long-term unemployed. We are implementing measures to increase excise tax collections,
particularly by reducing evasion of excise duties on alcoholic beverages, and will ensure that
excise rates are better correlated with the alcohol content and the production process. We will
consult with IMF/EC staff before undertaking any further changes of the tax system.
9.
We are making progress on a comprehensive reform of the tax administration
(ANAF):


We are applying the deregistering criteria for small VAT payers and maintain the
commitment to reduce the total number of small taxpayers registered for VAT
purposes by 20 percent between December 2011 and December 2012. To further
streamline the tax rolls, the government will introduce a mandatory simplified tax
regime for small taxpayers. With technical assistance from the IMF and EC, we will
prepare draft legislation in this area by end-October 2012, with the goal of
implementing it as of January 1, 2013.



We have identified 300 High Net-Wealth Individual (HNWI) taxpayers for the
dedicated compliance program. A notification campaign to encourage voluntary
declaration of incomes from abroad was undertaken in May. In order to strengthen
capacity, we will undertake training programs with the assistance of partner-country
tax administration specialists. We are currently seeking financing for an IT tool for
risk analysis.



As part of ANAF restructuring and modernization, we aim to consolidate the current
221 tax offices to eight regional directorates (by mid 2013) and 47 local tax offices
(by 2015). We will approve by end-2012 a multiannual project with the World Bank
to support this process.





We are strengthening tax enforcement efforts by increasing our capacity for risk
analysis and audit, and by improving the inter-operability with the Customs Authority
and the Financial Guard. In July, we set up a central unit for fighting intra-community
VAT fraud, with a focus on high-risk areas. We will improve the procedure for
transmitting referrals for tax crimes and enhance the cooperation between ANAF,
police and the Prosecutor's Office.



We will strengthen monitoring and control of the production, procurement, and
import of energy products and alcoholic beverages. Controls at the EU's external

64
border will be strengthened to combat illicit traffic of cigarettes and other processed
tobacco products.




We continue to expand e-filing and improve the one-stop shop for tax declarations.
We will also improve procedures for legal interpretations of the tax code by
introducing a single channel for communication with taxpayers.
ANAF took over the collection of health contributions by self-employed individuals
as scheduled in July. By December 2012, we will adopt the necessary regulations to
complete the integration of social contributions within the tax collection processes of
ANAF and to allow individual taxpayers to submit a single declaration for income tax
and social contributions as of January 2013. We will study the feasibility for ANAF
to collect property taxes on behalf of the local authorities.



10.
We continue to make progress in the implementation of the action plans based on the
recommendations of the functional reviews of government ministries and agencies conducted
last year. A new monitoring procedure was put in place, which was used by line ministries in
their progress reports submitted in July 2012. We will develop a staffing plan for the line
ministries within the parameters of the wage bill allocation in the budget by end-September
2012, based on the functional reviews of these ministries where possible. Separately, we
consider improvement of the efficiency and transparency of public procurement procedures
as a top priority. In line with the agreed timetable, we will implement by end-December 2012
the recommendations of the assessment carried out by the EC.
11.
Although we have made some progress in absorbing EU funds in the first half of the
year, further efforts are still required. The Romanian audit authority found problems in
system management in previous years. Consequently, some parts of certain programs were
interrupted. For high-priority EU-funded projects with problems, we will allocate the funds
to offset the interruption of EC reimbursement from the budgets of the respective line
ministries. For other projects, we will suspend payments until the situation has been clarified
with the EC. We will take all necessary measures to rectify identified problems. Moreover,
we will step up our efforts to boost absorption and are closely working with the EC to
simplify the procedure that will help with quicker absorption up to the beneficiaries' level.
Furthermore, we will continue to implement fully the April 2011 Priority Action Plan for the
absorption of Structural and Cohesion Funds.
12.
We have compiled an investment portfolio of all government projects to ensure
proper monitoring and prioritization, such that funding can be fully secured within a
medium-term horizon (3–5 years). As required under Decision 577, we will seek to ensure
that national programs co-financed with local governments are fully funded. No new
investment projects will be initiated while low priority projects will be discontinued and a list
of these projects will be published. The investment database will be updated to identify
priority projects funded through budgetary and EU funds by end-September 2012 (structural

65
benchmark). We will work with the World Bank, through a project financed with EU funds,
to enhance the capacity of the Ministry of Public Finance (MOPF) to evaluate and monitor
public investment projects. The Ministry of Regional Development and Tourism and the
Ministry of Environment and Forests are committed to ensure that execution spending under
the PNDI does not exceed RON 1 billion in 2012 and RON 1 billion in 2013, and no new
PNDI projects will be signed.
13.
Market conditions for public debt financing have become more strained owing to
heightened domestic political uncertainty and conditions in external markets. We remain
committed to consolidating the fiscal buffers, and maintain our ultimate objective of four
months of gross financing needs to protect against unforeseen external shocks. The net
interest paid on these buffers represents a necessary cost for insurance against shocks. We
intend to return to the external market again in the second half of this year, as market
conditions permit. We are continuing our efforts to widen the investor base and improve
outreach efforts. We have now published the debt management strategy, albeit with delay,
and are undertaking a project financed with European funds and implemented with support of
the World Bank to strengthen the debt management department. We will publish the update
of the 2013-15 debt management strategy in the first quarter of 2013.
Monetary Policy
14.
Core inflation has remained relatively low. In the third quarter, headline inflation is
expected to temporarily rebound towards the upper end of the central bank's target band of
3±1 percent as dis-inflationary base effects recede. Rapid exchange rate pass through and
eventual food price increases will put upward pressure on core inflation. Nonetheless,
inflation is expected to remain within the central bank’s target band throughout the year.
Upside risks persist, however, including from exchange rate volatility and higher-thanexpected global food prices.
15.
We have kept the policy rate at 5.25 percent since May on account of domestic and
external uncertainties. Lower net capital inflows have resulted in a depreciation of the leu of
more than five percent against the euro since the beginning of the year, while the central
bank’s stock of foreign reserves has adjusted. The risks of higher inflation and excessive
volatility in capital flows and the exchange rate continue to require a prudent monetary
policy stance, supported by a consistent macroeconomic policy mix. In the event exchange
rate pressures persist, we will tighten our monetary policy stance. We will continue regular
repurchase operations as needed to ensure adequate liquidity in the banking system. We will
also design and implement the necessary arrangements and internal procedures to allow
unlimited numbers (ISIN) of government securities to be eligible for the central bank’s open
market operations by end-October 2012. Furthermore, in an effort to enhance the
redistribution of liquidity across the banking sector, we will encourage the finalization of the
master repurchase agreement and all procedures needed for banks to be able to engage in
collateralized T-bill repo interbank lending.

66
Financial Sector
16.
The Romanian banking sector maintains reassuring capital buffers and provisions but
continues to be vulnerable to spillovers from the ongoing euro area crisis. Annual credit
growth to the nonfinancial corporate sector (in real terms and at a constant exchange rate) at
end-June remained subdued and declined somewhat to households. Nonperforming loans
(NPLs) continued to rise and stood at 16.8 percent in June compared to 14.3 percent at end2011, driven by the deterioration of the economic environment and partly by tighter
supervisory enforcement. Total prudential provisions at end-June were sufficient to cover 98
percent of NPLs while the IFRS provisioning ratio stood at 69 percent. Bank profitability
remains poor with an overall system loss during the first half of the year, mainly due to
higher provisioning. The capitalization of the banking sector remained strong at 14.7 percent
at end-June, albeit with some differences between banks. Overall, system household and
corporate deposits have increased by around three percent since end-2011. However, the
interbank market remains fragmented, due to perceived counterparty risk, and funding has
become more heterogeneous in the deposit segment. Compared to regional peers, foreignowned bank deleveraging has been orderly and moderate so far.
17.
The NBR will continue to intensively supervise the banking system and take any
necessary measures to ensure that banks have sufficient capital and liquidity, especially in
light of the uncertain environment. The NBR, Deposit Guarantee Fund (DGF), and the
MOPF will continue to coordinate the implementation of operational preparedness plans and
the arrangements for the acquired bank resolution powers according to their competencies.
The NBR will finalize the regulation on the authorization of the bridge bank and internal
procedures for the recently introduced bank resolution measures by end-September 2012.
The details of the updated NBR contingency planning framework will be shared and agreed
with the IMF and EC staff by end-October 2012. The NBR is preparing detailed contingency
plans on an ongoing basis. Based on the Memorandum of Understanding between the NBR
and the DGF, the two institutions will finalize the necessary internal arrangements to provide
the DGF with access to the already agreed set of relevant financial and prudential
information. The DGF will build up its expertise in analyzing the financial information
provided by the NBR. The NBR will continue to closely oversee bank practices to avoid
evergreening so as to ensure that IFRS loan-loss provisioning and collateral valuations, as
well as the assessment of credit risk of restructured loans, remain prudent and in line with
good international practices. The NBR will continue to collect periodic and detailed
supervisory data on restructured loans. As part of the permanent prudential arrangements that
will apply in 2013, the prudential filter will remain in place in the current form, in line with
the EU regulatory developments. Any amendments to measures adopted in 2011 to restrict
foreign-currency lending to unhedged households will be agreed with the IMF and EC staff.
18.
We will examine the impact of the recent amendment to the fiscal code that aims at
ensuring a neutral tax treatment of bank receivables sold to Romanian firms so that banks can
mitigate the rise in impaired loans and improve their balance sheet management. The law

67
amending the Law 503/2004 on the bankruptcy of insurance undertakings will be enacted by
end-October 2012. As preserving credit discipline and avoiding moral hazard among debtors
contributes significantly towards enhancing financial stability, we will refrain from adopting
legislative initiatives (for instance, proposals for the personal insolvency law and for the debt
collecting law) or amending Ordinance 50/2010, which would undermine credit discipline.
Structural Reforms
Regulatory and Strategic Reforms in Transport and Energy
19.
Comprehensive reform of the energy and transport sectors is a critical element of the
program to boost investment and growth. In the transport sector, we have merged the
subsidiaries of the railway companies CFR Marfa (freight) and CFR Calatori (passengers)
into their parent companies and we will complete the merger of CFR Infrastructura (rail
infrastructure) subsidiaries by mid-September 2012. We will bring down the total railway
network under management of CFR Infrastructura to 15,500 line kilometers by endSeptember.
20.
We have granted a bridge loan to clear CFR Infrastructura arrears to energy providers
and will eliminate penalties and principal on arrears owed to the state-owned electricity
supply company, Electrica, by mid-September. This bridge loan will be replaced in part by a
government-guaranteed loan to the rail infrastructure company by end-November 2012. As a
condition for this arrears clearance scheme, CFR Infrastructura has begun executing cost
reduction and revenue enhancement measures to move towards financial viability from 2013.
This requires that decisive action is taken to ensure that the state-owned passenger and
freight companies pay access charges in full to the infrastructure company. To facilitate full
payment, we intend to revaluate the provision of subsidies and the public service obligations
(PSO) of the passenger company, and take profitable services out of the PSO starting in
2013. In addition, further measures will be taken to reduce the costs and increase the
revenues of the rail passenger company.
21.
For the energy sector, we have taken a number of actions to establish a framework to
improve the sector’s efficiency. Electricity and gas legislation, in line with EU energy
directives, was promulgated and gazetted. We expect the law on the energy regulator
(ANRE) to be promulgated by end-September 2012. We also approved a roadmap to
deregulate gas prices that envisages complete liberalization of gas prices for non-residential
consumers by January 1, 2015, and for households by October 1, 2018. This follows earlier
approval of a roadmap to deregulate electricity prices. Regulated electricity prices were also
increased by five percent at end-June (structural benchmark).
22.
We took the extraordinary step of placing the hydro-electric power producer,
Hidroelectrica, into insolvency in June, in view of its deteriorating financial position. The
judicial administrator has cancelled all contracts at below-market prices with the energy
traders (so called “smart guys”). Hidroelectrica will sell the electricity being released from

68
the cancelled all contracts on the electricity trading platform (OPCOM). In addition, the
administrator is pursuing cost savings throughout the company, with a target to reduce costs
by at least 10 percent. These measures will result in a significant improvement in
Hidroelectrica’s financial position. The results of the renegotiated contracts will be published
(price, volume, and maturity reductions).
23.
We plan to further enhance the pricing and regulatory framework in the energy sector
by undertaking the following additional steps:


We will publish the full versions of the electricity and gas price-liberalization
roadmaps by mid-September on the websites of all relevant institutions and start
phasing out regulated electricity and gas prices in September and December 2012,
respectively. We will provide quarterly progress reports on the implementation of
both the gas and electricity roadmaps starting from October 1, 2012.



The pass-through mechanism for electricity and gas purchases by the supply
companies provided for in the electricity and gas supply regulation will be applied in
line with the regulatory framework, in order to strengthen investment in this sector.
To better align the current regulated end-user prices of gas with the actual cost of
supply and distribution, we will increase tariff rates for non-residential consumers by
10 percent and for households by five percent by September 15 (prior action). This
alignment is necessary because, in recent years, ANRE has not been permitted to
fully implement its regulations on gas supply and distribution, which generated a
backlog in price adjustments.



We are taking steps to strengthen OPCOM as a trading platform. A working group of
OPCOM and large electricity consumers has designed a new trading instrument
tailored for the needs of large consumers. OPCOM will submit the new instrument
for ANRE’s review and approval. OPCOM is also making progress, in consultation
with the gas industry, on the design of a gas trading platform. OPCOM plans to
launch the gas platform on December 1, 2012, in a testing/participant training mode
and start commercial operation in March 2013. All new bilateral contracts of SOEs
will be made transparently and non-discriminatorily through OPCOM (electricity)
and other competitive procedures (gas), and the terms of the contracts will be
published. As soon as the new gas trading platform is operational, all non-regulated
bilateral gas contracts will be traded through it.



We have set-up an inter-ministerial committee, chaired by the MOPF, to prepare in
consultation with the oil, gas, and electricity industry a draft package of tax, royalty
and regulatory measures for these sectors. The package will cover two parts: (a) a
levy to capture part of the extraordinary revenue to firms resulting from the
liberalization of gas and electricity prices, as specified in the roadmaps. Funds raised
will help finance measures to protect vulnerable consumers from the impact of the

69
necessary retail price adjustments; and (b) a new oil and gas regulatory and taxation
regime for the period 2015–24, to be prepared, with professional advice, by end-2012.
We plan to put in place the windfall levy from January 2013 and introduce the new
oil and gas regulatory and taxation regime by mid-2013. In line with our obligations
as a member of the EU, we are ready to begin negotiations on the Inter-Governmental
Agreement (IGA) with Russia and will also strive to take steps to diversify our gas
supply. We will take the necessary steps to lift the existing implicit export
restrictions, and take measures to implement reverse flows on the gas interconnectors.


We will take steps to ensure prompt application of Emergency Ordinance 69/2011 on
subsidies for district heating. Municipalities have allowed for some increase in endconsumer prices. We will continue to monitor, and report to the IMF, EC, and WB on
a quarterly basis, the financial situation of the district heating system and ensure
prompt application of the provisions of the emergency ordinance. We will also ensure
that the district heating companies will report to the Ministry of Administration and
Interior, which will issue a decision, together with the MOPF, within 30 days,
Reimbursement will begin in the following month.

State-Owned Enterprises
24.
The second quarter indicative targets on the operating balance and arrears in key
companies were met. We note that achievement of the third quarter arrears target is
dependent upon finding a buyer for Oltchim and achievement of the fourth quarter arrears
target on finalization of the liquidation of C.N. Huilei. While we have achieved
improvements in some companies over the last months, overall progress has been slower than
anticipated and substantial measures remain to be taken. The specialized divisions of
financial control within the MOPF has reviewed and approved most of the 2012 budgets for
117 SOEs under its purview and will complete the budget approval process by midSeptember 2012. Ten of these companies are being liquidated. Moreover, the directorate has
reviewed all but two of the restructuring plans. The directorate plans to meet with all the
companies whose restructuring plans could not be quantified by mid-September 2012. We
will monitor performance against those targets on a quarterly basis. We will also prepare and
publish the comprehensive reports on SOEs required under Article 58 of ordinance
(109/2011) by end-October 2012, and annually thereafter by end-May.
25.
Our efforts to accelerate the SOE governance reform agenda by concentrating our
efforts on the sale of shares in Transgaz, Romgaz, Hidroelectrica, and Nuclearelectrica
(companies in the Ministry of Economy’s portfolio) have not yet yielded any tangible results
(with the exception of the significant measures being taken by the insolvency administrators
of Hidroelectrica). The planned secondary public offering (SPO) of government shares in
Transgaz by end-June 2012 was delayed due to technical problems, but the tender will be
launched by mid-September 2012 (prior action). We will miss the deadline for the sale of
shares in Romgaz and Hidroelectica by mid-October 2012 (structural benchmark). The

70
transaction advisor for Romgaz recommended that a valuation of Romgaz’s natural gas
holdings be completed before an initial public offering (IPO) is launched. We are in the
process of hiring a consultant to conduct the study, which we expect to be completed by the
end of the year. We are firmly committed to launch the IPO of Romgaz by end-March 2013.
We plan to hold an IPO of 10 percent of the shares in Hidroelectrica after the company exits
the insolvency process. We will expedite preparations for the sale of Nuclearelectrica shares
but will miss the previously agreed deadline of end-2012 by one quarter. We will privatize
Oltchim, a large chemical manufacturer, by offering it for sale by mid-September (prior
action). The privatization of Tarom (SPO of 20 percent) and CFR Marfă (majority
privatization) this year remains a priority for the Ministry of Transportation and
Infrastructure.
As for other companies in the Ministry of Economy’s portfolio, we plan to sell a
26.
majority stake in Electrica Furnizare and Electrica’s three distribution companies by early
2013, followed by an IPO of Electrica by mid-2013. Other companies slated for privatization
offerings by early 2013 are: (i) the new energy producer Hunedoara, to be created by endSeptember 2012 by merging the power plants in Paroşeni and Mintia and four mines of C.N.
Huilei (majority privatization); and (ii) the new energy producer Oltenia (majority
privatization). The privatization of Oltenia Energy Complex is critical given its large
investment needs and key role in Romania’s energy security. With this mind, we will sign a
contract with a legal and transaction advisor for the privatization of Oltenia by endNovember 2012 (structural benchmark). We may pursue dual listings for some public
offerings but will ensure that this does not lead to unnecessary delays in the privatization
process. In addition, we will liquidate non-viable companies and plan to file for liquidation of
C.N. Huilei by end- September 2012 and Termoelectrica by early October 2012.
27.
We are in the process to appoint professional boards and management for key SOEs
that remain under majority government ownership as required under the new SOE corporate
governance law. New management teams and board members were to be selected by endJune 2012 for Oltchim, Hidroelectrica, and Electrica Furnizare. We now plan to appoint
professional boards for Electrica Furnizare by end-August and Hidroelectrica by midSeptember 2012. The appointment of a general manager for Electrica Furnizare will take
place by end-September. For Hidroelectrica, the appointment of a general manager will take
place promptly after the company exits the insolvency process. Given the difficult operating
and financial position of Oltchim, we have appointed a special administrator in July to
prepare the company for full privatization. We also plan to appoint a professional board and
general manager for Oltenia with help from a independent human resource firm by endSeptember 2012.
28.
Going forward, we will accelerate implementation of the SOE corporate governance
law. We will only select professional board members and management from lists of qualified
candidates prepared by independent firms hired to assist in the process. We recognize that
doing otherwise would undermine the credibility of our reform program for the public and

71
for prospective investors. We intend to improve the law through modifications that establish
a limited negative list of three companies exempted from the law on defense, public order,
and national security grounds. The modifications will also require SOEs to implement the
provisions to appoint professional boards and general managers and complete this process
within a maximum period of nine months. Moreover, the modifications will specify that the
appointment of interim boards and general managers will be only for a limited time period.
29.
We have launched a coordinated process to search and appoint professional board
members and general managers for the other priority SOEs in the Ministry of Economy’s
portfolio, including Romgaz, Nuclearelectrica, and Transgaz. We now plan to complete this
process for Romgaz, Nuclearelectrica, and Transgaz by end-2012. All appointments will be
published for full transparency. For SOEs under the Ministry of Transportation and
Infrastructure, we have hired a human resource firm to select qualified candidates for the
boards of directors and managements of eleven firms in its portfolio, including CFR Calatori
and CFR Infrastructura. We will appoint the new boards of directors and professional
management by end-September 2012.
Other Structural Reforms
30.
We continue to make progress in implementing new labor market and social
assistance legislation. The new Labor Code has significantly improved the functioning of the
labor market, and already contributed to a recovery in employment with substantial number
of informal work arrangements being converted to newly registered contracts. Nearly one
third of these new contracts are fixed term. We will monitor implementation of the Social
Dialogue Law and ensure that any amendments will only be undertaken in consultation with
all stakeholders and do not introduce undue rigidities and distortions in the collective
bargaining process. We will also continue cooperation with the International Labor
Organization (ILO) to ensure that the new legislation respects core ILO Conventions. The
government, in consultation with its international partners, will prepare by October a package
of measures aimed at job creation for people younger than 25 years and older than 55 years.
31.
We will coordinate with all relevant stakeholders the speedy implementation of the
forthcoming recommendations from the World Bank Report on Standards and Codes on
insolvency and creditor rights.

Attachment II. Romania: Technical Memorandum of Understanding
September 12, 2012
1.
This Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU) defines the variables included
in the quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets set out in the Memorandum of
Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP), the key assumptions, the methods to be applied in
assessing program performance, and the reporting requirements to ensure adequate
monitoring of economic and financial developments. The quantitative performance criteria
and indicative targets, and structural benchmarks for 2011 and 2012 are listed in Tables 1 and
2 of the MEFP, respectively.
2.
For the purposes of the program, the exchange rates of the Romanian Leu (RON) to
the euro is set at RON 4.2848 = €1, to the U.S. dollar at RON 3.2045 = $1, to the Japanese
yen at RON 3.9400 = ¥100, and to the pound sterling at RON 4.9673 = £1, the rates as shown
on the National Bank of Romania’s (NBR’s) website as of December 31, 2010. The
exchange rates to other currencies, where applicable, will also be the ones shown on the
NBR’s website as of December 31, 2010.
3.
For the purposes of the program, the general government includes the entities as
defined in the 2012 budget. These are: the central government (state budget, treasury, selffinanced state entities included in the budget, etc.), local governments, social security funds
(pension, health, and unemployment), and the road fund company. This definition of general
government also includes any new funds, or other special budgetary and extra budgetary
programs that may be created during the program period to carry out operation of a fiscal
nature as defined in the IMF’s Manual on Government Finance Statistics 2001. The
authorities will inform the IMF staff of the creation of any such new funds or programs
immediately. As mentioned in ¶12 below, this definition will be expanded to cover stateowned enterprises incorporated into the general government accounts under ESA95, upon
completion of the review being undertaken by Eurostat and successful implementation of the
monitoring system being undertaken by the Ministry of Public Finance (MOPF).

75
Quantitative Performance Criteria, Indicative Targets, Inflation Consultation Band,
and Continuous Performance Criteria
A. Floor on the Change in Net Foreign Assets
1.
For program purposes, Net Foreign Assets (NFA) are defined as the NFA of the NBR
minus Treasury liabilities to the International Monetary Fund.
2.
NFA of the NBR are defined as the euro value of gross foreign assets of the NBR
(including reserve requirements of the commercial banking system held at the NBR) minus
gross foreign liabilities of the NBR; and will be measured on the basis of the NBR’s
operational rather than accounting definitions. Non-euro denominated foreign assets and
liabilities will be converted into euro at the program exchange rates.
3.
Gross foreign assets of the NBR are defined to include the NBR’s holdings of SDRs,
the country's reserve position at the IMF, holdings of cash, securities and deposits abroad in
convertible foreign currencies. Excluded from reserve assets are: (i) gold and other precious
metals; (ii) assets in nonconvertible currencies; (iii) illiquid assets; (iv) any assets that are
pledged, collateralized, or otherwise encumbered, unless there is also a gross foreign liability
associated with it; (v) claims on residents; and (vi) claims in foreign exchange arising from
derivatives in foreign currencies vis-à-vis domestic currency (such as futures, forwards,
swaps, and options).
4.
Gross foreign liabilities of the NBR are defined as all foreign exchange liabilities to
residents and nonresidents, including commitments to sell foreign exchange arising from
derivatives (such as futures, forwards, swaps, and options), and all credit outstanding from
the IMF, but excluding (i) banks’ foreign currency deposits against reserve requirements; and
(ii) government foreign currency deposits at the NBR. This definition is meant to bring the
concept of foreign liabilities closer to the balance of payment definition, on which the targets
are based.

The NFA targets will be adjusted upward (downward) by the full amount of the
surplus (shortfall) relative to the baseline of external bond placement by the MOPF. NFA
targets will also be adjusted (i) upward (downward) by the surplus (shortfall) in program
disbursements relative to the baseline projection (Program disbursements are defined as
external disbursements from official creditors (WB and the EC) that are usable for the
financing of the overall central government budget) and (ii) upward by the increase in
commercial bank reserve requirements held with the NBR relative to end-December 2011
(€6,037 million), measured at program exchange rates.

6.
The quarterly consultation bands for the 12-month rate of inflation in consumer prices
(as measured by the headline consumer price index (CPI) published by the Romanian
Statistical Institute), are specified below. Should the observed year-on-year rate of CPI
inflation fall outside the outer bands specified below, the authorities will complete a
consultation with the IMF on their proposed policy response before requesting further
purchases under the program. In addition, the NBR will conduct discussions with IMF staff
should the observed year-on-year rate of CPI inflation fall outside the inner bands specified
for the end of each quarter in the table below.

Target for 2012:Q1 is adjusted by RON 1450 million to RON 4550 for capital spending.
3
Target for 2012:Q2 is adjusted by RON 769.8 for the the bridge loan granted by the
Ministry of Finance to CN Cai Ferate CFR SA.

8.
Starting from end-March 2012 performance criterion, the budget deficit will be
measured from above the line using the budget execution data. Expenditure will include the
value of the works executed under the contracts from the National Program for Infrastructure
Development (PNDI).
9.
Once the reporting system for state-owned enterprises (SOEs) is fully functional, the
budget deficit target will be modified to be in line with the expanded definition of the general
government, which will include the following SOEs: C.N. de Autostrãzi si Drumuri
Nationale din România SA, Metrorex SA, Administratia Fluviala Dunarea de Jos, CFR
Calatori, CN Huila Petrosani SA, SN a Carbunelui Ploiesti SA, CN Radiocomunicatii
Constanta, SC Interventii Feroviare, CFR Infrastructura, SC Termoelectrica SA, Societatea
Nationala Aeroportul International Mihail Kogalniceanu, SC Electrificare SA, CN
Administratia Canalelor Navigabile Constanţa SA , SC CN Romarm, Santierul Naval
Mangalia SA, Societatea Feroviara de Turism SFT CFR, SC Uzina Mecanica Orastie, SC
Avioane Craiova SA, SC Petromin SA, SC Constructii Aeronautice SA, SC Sanevit 2003
SA, SC Uzina AutoMecanica SA Moreni, SC Terom SA, SN Plafar SA, and SC Nicolina SA.
10.
The Ministry of Public Finance (MOPF) will also provide monthly data to measure
the deficit from below the line. The balance of the general government measured from below
the line will include:
+ (i) net external financing, excluding valuation gains and losses;
+ (ii) change in net domestic credit from the financial system, excluding valuation gains
and losses from deposits denominated in foreign currency and including adjustments for;

78
+ (a) received EU funds not yet spent (advance payments);
+ (b) claims of the government on EU funds;
+ (c) property fund obligations not yet paid;
+ (iii) change in the stock of issued government securities, net of valuation changes;
+ (iv) net changes in other financing;
of which: (a) temporary financing for EU projects;
(b) reimbursement payments from EU for the EU projects
11.
If the difference between the general government deficit measured from above the
line and from below the line is larger than lei 200 million each quarter during 2011 and 2012,
the MOPF will consult with IMF staff.
12.
The performance criterion for the general government balance for end-June 2012 and
end-September 2012 (measured on a cumulative basis from the beginning of the year) will be
adjusted downward by the amount that capital spending (including spending related to EU
funds and arrears reduction plans, but excluding the works executed under the contracts from
the PNDI) exceeds lei 15,230 million and lei 25,150 million, respectively, up to a limit of lei
1,800 million and lei 700 million, respectively. The performance criterion for the general
government balance for end-June 2012 and end-September (measured on a cumulative basis
from the beginning of the year) will be adjusted downward by the amount of a bridge bank
loan for arrears clearance of CFR Infrastructura, up to a limit of lei 900 million.
D.

Performance Criterion Limiting the Issuance of Government Guarantees to the
Non-Financial Private Sector and Public Enterprises

13.
The issuance of general government guarantees to the nonfinancial private sector and
public enterprises will be limited during the program period. This ceiling is set at RON
14 billion but may be adjusted upward by up to RON 9.6 billion for guarantees for financing
the Nabucco project. Revision to targets will be renegotiated during future missions to allow
for reasonable public guarantees in the context of privatization of majority stakes in stateowned enterprises and securitization of domestic payment arrears.

Performance Criterion on the Stock of Domestic Arrears by the Central
Government and Social Security System

14.
The performance criterion established on the stock in domestic payments arrears of
the central government and social security sector (as defined in ¶3 above) contemplates their
elimination during the program period. The stock will be measured net of intergovernmental
arrears, but both gross and net arrears will be reported by the government. In case of need,
the government will take corrective measures to prevent the accumulation of new spending
arrears. For the purpose of the program, arrears mean accounts payable past due date by
90 days (in line with ESA95 definitions for expenditures).

Continuous Performance Criteria on Non-Accumulation of External Payments
Arrears by the General Government

15.
The general government will not accumulate external payment arrears during the
program period. For the purposes of this performance criterion, an external payment arrear
will be defined as a payment by the general government that has not been made within seven
days of falling due. The performance criterion will apply on a continuous basis.
G.

Indicative Target on General Government Current Primary Spending

Technical Assistance

The transition in Romania has been supported by substantial technical assistance from multilateral
agencies and bilateral donors. The Fund has provided support in a number of areas with more than
40 technical assistance missions since 1990, although the authorities have had a mixed record with
regard to implementation. Expert Fund assistance has focused on a number of key areas, including:
fiscal reforms; modernization of the central bank and the banking system; creating a marketoriented legal structure; training; improving the collection and reporting of statistics; and
AML/CFT.
The implementation of a comprehensive tax administration reform designed in line with the
recommendations of several technical assistance missions of the Fund’s Fiscal Affairs Department
started in January 2003. A report on the observance of standards and codes (ROSC) on fiscal
transparency was completed on November 6, 2002 (IMF Country Report No. 02/254). A public
debt management technical assistance (TA) mission was fielded in April 2006. In July 2009, an
FAD TA mission assisted the authorities with the preparation of a fiscal responsibility law (FRL).
There have been four FAD TA missions providing advice on revenue administration issues since
2009, focusing on recommendations to improve service and compliance and strengthen the tax
administration’s organizational structure. Many of the recommendations have been implemented or
are on-going. A high net wealth individual unit was established and audits should begin in 2012.
There were follow-up missions in April and November 2012 on the implementation of the FRL and
budget execution at central and local levels. An FAD mission in December 2011 provided advice
on budget-related legislation, accounting systems and processes, and a progressive move towards
program budgeting. This was followed-up by a March 2012 mission, which provided detailed
guidance on a conceptual design and other requirements of systems to improve fiscal reporting and
commitment control. Missions by the IMF’s regional public financial management advisor in
August and October 2011 assisted the authorities with further developing debt management
capacity. A tax policy mission in November 2011 reviewed the tax system and developed a
roadmap for reform that would make the tax system simpler and more buoyant, while enhancing
fairness.

4
In 2003 an FSAP was completed, and an FSAP Update was completed in Aug 2009. Furthermore,
technical assistance by the Fund’s Monetary and Capital Markets Department (MCM) on (liquidity)
stress testing took place in September 2010 and October 2011. In November 2010, a MCM TA
mission on bank resolution was completed which followed a TA mission in October 2009 by the
IMF’s Legal Department to assess Romania’s progress in amending the banking and winding-up
legislations.
X.

Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism Framework

The authorities have undertaken a number of measures to improve the legal and institutional
structural to combat money laundering and corruption. In 2011, a law that imposes international
standards on prevention and sanctioning of money laundering became effective. Financial
institutions are applying enhanced customer due diligence on all foreign politically exposed persons
(PEPs) and follow a risk-based approach in the application of enhanced customer due diligence on
domestic PEPs in accordance with recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force.
Databases on depositors, landowners, and shareholders are maintained to assist the authorities in
identifying beneficial owners of assets and a protocol exists for the sharing of information,
including on suspicious transactions, between the local financial intelligence unit and national anticorruption agency (ANI). A national anti-corruption strategy was recently endorsed by the
government and parliament and the Ministry of Justice has taken the lead in coordinating its
implementation and establishing benchmarks to monitor its implementation.
XI.

Safeguards Assessment

Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, the National Bank of Romania (NBR) was subject
to full safeguards assessment with respect to the Stand-By Arrangement approved on
August 4, 2009. The assessment, completed on August 29, 2009, concluded that the NBR continues
to have a relatively strong safeguards framework in place. An update of the assessment conducted
in 2011 found a robust safeguards framework at the NBR and recommended measures to sustain
NFA reporting standards and effective audit oversight, and enhance accounting disclosures.
XII.

Resident Representative

The Fund has had a resident representative in Bucharest since 1991. Mr. Tonny Lybek assumed the
post of regional resident representative in March 2009.

ANNEX II. ROMANIA: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
A. Partnership in Romania’s Development Strategy
Like all countries in the region, Romania had to deal with the aftermath of the economic crisis
combined with the risk of a renewed and deeper crisis in the euro area. Romania’s challenge
now is to combine short-term crisis management with medium-term structural reforms that will
make it not only more resistant to shocks, but will also allow it to take advantage of a future
economic upswing. Structural reforms must support resumed convergence toward EU living
standards, a sustainably macroeconomic and fiscal framework, and social cohesion.
The World Bank’s Development Policy Loan with Deferred Drawdown Option (DPL-DDO)
helps to support Romania in the event of an exogenous macroeconomic shock while
contributing to advancing the structural reform program. The DPL-DDO makes financing
available up to EUR 1 billion that can be drawn down by the Government if and when required,
provided they are on track with the macroeconomic framework and the reform program supported
by the DPL-DDO. Structural reforms in the areas of public finance, the energy sector and the health
sector are supported through this World Bank program. The DPL-DDO complements the IMF and
EC assistance (TA) programs. The World Bank also has several sector investment operations,
technical assistance programs, economic and sector work, and commitments through the
International Finance Corporation.
The IMF and World Bank staffs maintain a close collaborative relationship in supporting the
Government’s reform program and coordinate their policy advice to the Romanian
authorities.
B. IMF-World Bank Collaboration in Specific Areas
Public sector reform. The Bank and the Fund support measures to address the weaknesses in
public expenditure management that relate to addressing fiscal deficits and improving revenue
collection through tax policy and administration reforms. The Bank’s DPL-DDO program supports
the strengthening of the Medium Term Expenditure Framework to improve the financial
management and predictability of public spending as well as the quality of public services. The
DPL-DDO also supports the modernization of tax administration, with the objective to enhance
revenue collection, improve tax compliance and reduce the transactions costs for doing business. In
addition, through the DPL-DDO and a series of TA programs, some financed from the EU
structural funds, the Bank supports measures to enhance strategic planning and policy formulation
and coordination, as well as the establishment of policy monitoring and evaluation systems at the
center of the Government. The purpose of the technical assistance is to strengthen linkages between
resources and performance in the public sector.
Financial sector reforms. Under the DPL series, the Bank is supporting measures to strengthen the
functioning and resilience of the financial sector. TA was also provided to the financial sector
authorities, and the Ministry of Justice of Romania, in relation with the DPL series. The TA focused

6
in particular on: a) assistance to the Ministry of Justice in the preparation of Guidelines for
Corporate Debt Restructuring and in amending the Insolvency Law so as to remove obstacles to
out-of-court corporate debt restructuring; and b) assistance to the National Bank of Romania (NBR)
on the preparation of Guidelines for Mortgage Debt Restructuring. A crisis simulation exercise is
planned for mid September 2012. The exercise will assess coordination and decision-making
processes between and within the NBR and the Ministry of Public Finance. It will also test the new
legal mechanisms for bank resolution which were recently approved. The securities regulator and
the pension regulator will be involved as role players in the exercise. A first version draft scenario
is currently for comments with the NBR and the Ministry of Public Finance.
C. Areas Where the World Bank Leads and Its Analyses Serve as Inputs Into the IMF
Policy Formulation and Advice
Social Protection. Under the IMF-Bank partnership, the IMF has paid close attention to the social
dimension of the programs. For example, the fiscal deficit target allows for protecting the poor and
low-income earners from the impact of the global crisis, through higher social spending and
measures to increase the coverage of the best targeted programs and the protection of the vulnerable
household consumers against the energy price increases. At the same time the IMF welcomed the
consolidation of the social assistance programs which is supported by the results-based program
financed by the Bank, beginning with 2012.
Health. The Bank supports the Government program in health through an investment operation and
the DPL-DDO program. The DPL-DDO program aims at strengthening the financial sustainability
of the national health system through: (i) the revision of the basic package of subsidized health
services, procedures and drugs through the introduction health technology assessment; and (ii) the
implementation of the National Hospital Rationalization Strategy, including the reduction of the
total number hospital beds.
Energy. Through the DPL-DDO the Bank supports key structural reforms in the energy sector.
These include the privatization or sale of minority stakes in energy generators, transporters and
distributors; the liberalization of the electricity and gas markets; governance reforms in energy
SOEs, including the restructuring of boards and the appointment of professional management; legal
and regulatory changes to align with the EU norms; and measures to encourage the participation of
the private sector in energy.
D. IFC Program
IFC’s current committed portfolio is $619 million, the fourth largest in the Europe and
Central Asia region after Turkey, Russia and Ukraine. IFC has played an active crisis response
role in Romania, investing over $630 million of its own funds and mobilizing an additional
$242 million in 25 projects since July 2009, with particular support provided to the financial,
renewable energy, and health sectors.

7
While vulnerabilities from the euro zone crisis and global economic downturn persist, IFC
will continue to play a countercyclical role through selective private sector investments in
Romania. In the real sector, this includes supporting projects which create jobs, increase
investment in underserved frontier regions, contribute to the growth and competitiveness of local
firms in promising sectors such as agribusiness and infrastructure, and improve resource efficiency.
IFC will support competitive domestic firms seeking to expand into regional markets, as well as
South-South investment into Romania. In the banking sector, which is largely dominated by foreign
banks (accounting for approximately 80 percent of banking assets), IFC works with local banks to
strengthen their capacity to provide loans to underserved sectors, such micro, small- and mediumsize enterprises and the agri sector, and to offer products such as local currency, trade and energy
efficiency finance. The IFC response in Romania focuses on supporting both banks and nonbanking financial institutions in providing: (i) trade products to address immediate liquidity
concerns; (ii) mezzanine and equity investments to shore up capital shortfalls with particular focus
on the recapitalization of existing banking sector clients; and (iii) scaled-up funding support to
micro, small- and medium-size enterprises. These actions, in coordination with other private
investors and development finance institutions, are also expected to counter the deleveraging risk in
these markets.
E. World Bank Group Strategy and Lending Operations
The current IBRD and IFC Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Romania, covering the
period 2009-2013, was presented to the Board on July 16 2009. The main objective of the
Country Strategy is to deepen the reform agenda for improved public sector management, economic
growth and competitiveness, and social and spatial cohesion. The focus of the DPL-DDO program
on public financial management, governance of SOEs in the energy sector, and health sector
reforms is consistent with these objectives. The DPL-DDO program takes also into account the
added focus of the CPS Progress Report (CPSPR)2 on the European perspective: (i) policy reforms
to reap the benefits of EU membership and meet the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy;
(ii) modernization of public institutions to enhance resource allocation and absorption of EU funds;
and (iii) complement to EU funding. The CPS outlines a substantial Analytical and Advisory
Services program that complements the DPL-DDO program.
Romania’s lending portfolio consists of 12 lending operations with an undisbursed
commitment of $1,068 billion and an Analytical and Advisory Activities portfolio of eight
ongoing activities3, including two Fee-Based Services (FBS-Transport and Justice). The size of the
portfolio increased by about 75 percent as compared with June 2011 with the approval at end FY11
of the Modernization of Social Assistance Loan ($710M). Grant financing increased as well, as a
new IDF grant for M&E of Policymaking (US$0.43M) was added, mid March, to the ongoing
portfolio.

As of April 2012.

8

The weight of Analytic and Advisory Activities in country services is increasing significantly,
with main emphasis on Fee-Based TA. This reflects the addition to the Bank program of the
Fee-Based Functional Reviews TA (FBS FRs) and the follow up through the MAP (Modernization
of Public Administration) TA program. Moreover, the Government through the European
Commission, requested the Bank (and other IFIs - EIB, EBRD) to support the strengthening of its
capacity in policy and strategy formulation, sector and project planning, design and implementation
in order to increase the absorption capacity of EU structural and cohesion funds. In this sense a
Memorandum of Understanding between the Government and the Bank was signed in January 2012
as an umbrella for the further development of specific activities. Meetings and exchanges with all
stakeholders took place in Q3FY12 along the areas for technical assistance: public administration
reforms; regional development; environment and climate change; energy; transport;
competitiveness; human resources development.
The composition of Romania’s program is shifting from investment landing and analytical
work to results based and DPL lending, and Fee-Based Services. This development is generated
by the actual needs of the Government, namely: (i) an ambitious reform program for the Social
Assistance Sector, that could be best supported by the Bank via a Results-Based operation; (ii) the
Government structural reform agenda that needs to be completed (SOEs, Energy, Transport, Health
sectors) combined with GOR’s market orientation for the financing of its public debt, which called
for a “buffer” deferred draw-down DPL that can support the implementation of reforms and also
consolidate Romania’s position on the financial markets, without adding to the debt outstanding;
(iii) the availability of non-reimbursable Structural Funds (whose absorption is a first priority for
Romania) which reduces the interest for classical SILs and calls on the Bank to only complement
EU support via operations that can boost the outcomes from current budgets. Fee-based services
weight in country services is increasing, in line with Romania’s actual priorities of modernizing its
public administration, and strengthening its capacity for EU Funds absorption (32 FBS projects
under preparation).

ANNEX III. ROMANIA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Romania—STATISTICAL ISSUES
As of August 27, 2012
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is adequate for surveillance. The quality of the national accounts,
price, fiscal, and balance of payments data is adequate. The authorities have improved
economic and financial statistics with technical assistance, including from the Fund, over the
past several years. Romania began participating in the GDDS in February 2001 and
graduated to subscription to the SDDS in Aug 2005.
National accounts: Quarterly and annual national accounts statistics are produced by the
National Institute for Statistics (INS) using the European System of Accounts 1995 (ESA95).
Estimates are methodologically sound and are reported to the Fund on a timely basis for
publication in the International Financial Statistics (IFS). Provisional and semi-final
versions are disseminated in the Statistical Yearbook and other publications, as well as on the
web (www.insse.ro).
Inflation: The Consumer Price Index is subject to standard annual re-weighting, and is
considered reliable. In January 2004, the INS changed the coverage of the Producer Price
Index to include the domestic and export sectors.
Labor market: Labor market statistics are broadly adequate. The definition used for
employment is consistent with ESA 95.
Public finances: Annual GFS data are reported on an accrual basis derived from cash data
using various adjustment methods. Tax revenues are adjusted using the time-adjusted cash
method; expense data are adjusted using due-for-payments data; and interest payments are
calculated on an accrual basis. Beginning in 2002, the Special Fund for Development of the
Energy System, the Special Fund for Public Roads, the Special Fund “Romanian Agriculture
Development,” and the Special Fund “Romania” were included in the state budget, while the
Special Fund for Insured Protection was eliminated from general government accounts. The
reported data excluded data on the Agency for Recovery Bank Assets.4 EUR receives
monthly cash budget execution data. Accrual data are available on a quarterly basis and with
a 55 day lag after the end of each quarter.
Consolidated data on central government operations are reported for inclusion in the GFS
4

Formerly the Agency for Bank Asset Recovery and the Authority for Privatization and Management of State
Ownership.

10
Yearbook. Consolidated general government data were reported for the first time for
inclusion in the 2005 GFS Yearbook.
Monetary and financial data: The National Bank of Romania (NBR) reports monetary and
financial statistics on a regular and timely basis for publication in the IFS. Since
December 2004, the NBR reports monetary data to STA using the Standardized Report
Forms (SRFs). The data are being published in the IFS Supplement, beginning
September 2006. Romania’s data and metadata for financial soundness indicators are posted
on the IMF’s website (http://www.imf.org/external/np/sta/fsi/eng/cce/index.htm).
Balance of payments: The NBR routinely reports balance of payments statistics to the Fund
in a timely fashion. A 2003 STA mission undertook a detailed review of the NBR’s
compilation methodology for balance of payments and international investment position
statistics, developed in consultation with Eurostat, and concluded that the proposed system is
broadly appropriate. The STA mission supported implementation of this compilation system
in 2004, along with a new FDI survey. The authorities have agreed to balance of payments
publication in the BPM6 format using a matrix conversion system starting from August 2012.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Romania is subscriber to the Fund’s Special
Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) since
August 4, 2005.

IMF Reports on the Observance of Standards
and Codes (ROSC) have been published as
Country Report No. 01/206, 02/254 and
03/389.

ROMANIA
Staff Report for the 2012 Article IV Consultation, Sixth Review Under the Stand-By
Arrangement, and Requests for Waiver of Nonobservance of Performance Criterion
and Modification of Performance Criteria—Supplementary Information
Prepared by the European Department
(In Consultation with Other Departments)
Approved by Poul M. Thomsen and Vivek Arora
September 25, 2012
1.
This supplement provides an update on economic and policy developments since
the issuance of the staff report on September 13, 2012. The additional information does
not change the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Recent indicators suggest positive growth due to higher domestic demand. The
latest GDP data release for 2012:Q2 showed a 0.5 percent real expansion broadly in line with
expectations and driven largely by a stronger-than-expected recovery in domestic demand
which offset a negative contribution from net exports. Real GDP growth in 2012:Q1 was
revised up from -0.1 percent to 0.1 percent. High frequency indicators suggest that industrial
production is recovering from a temporary dip in June while retail and wholesale trade
continue to show solid growth. However, consumer confidence has been stagnating since
May.
3.
Annual inflation increased to 3.9 percent reaching the upper bound of the target
band. This rate was somewhat higher than expected, reflecting the impact of food and fuel
price increases. Core inflation remained stable at 2.5 percent, in line with projections.
4.
Financial market conditions have improved somewhat as the political
uncertainty subsided following the Constitutional Court decision that reinstated
Mr. Basescu as President. The five-year sovereign CDS spreads have declined by more
than 110 bps since early-August to slightly above 310 bps in recent days. The authorities
have successfully issued a 10-year Eurobond at 5.1 percent yield which was met with strong
market demand. The stock market has benefited from the recent improved market sentiment
and gained about 14 percent year to date. Improved market sentiment contributed to a leu
appreciation of 3 percent against the euro from the record lows reached in early-August,
which allowed the NBR to scale down interventions in support of the leu while holding
depreciation against the euro at about 4 percent for the year. Banking system deposits and
total exposure of the largest foreign banks have remained stable in recent weeks.

2
5.
Preliminary figures through August show budget performance remains on track
to meet program targets. The cash deficit through August reached 1.2 percent of GDP
compared to the target of 2.2 percent for 2012. Strict spending discipline has been
maintained. Efforts to reduce local government arrears are ongoing.
6.
The government has completed the prior actions. On September 10, the
government approved an Ordinance changing the mechanism for tax sharing to enable
payment of local government arrears. On September 15, the government issued an order
increasing gas prices for both household and non-household consumers as planned. These
steps will help ensure full cost recovery and market-based pricing. On September 6 and
September 18, respectively, the tenders for the public offerings of shares in Oltchim and
Transgaz were launched.

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with
Romania
On September 28, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the 2012 Article IV Consultation with Romania.1
Background
Following the severe downturn in 2008–09, the Romanian economy has undertaken a large
adjustment to restore macroeconomic stability. Under two successive IMF Stand-By
Arrangements and with support of the European Commission and the World Bank, significant
progress has been made in reversing large external and internal imbalances. Sustained fiscal
consolidation, mainly achieved through spending constraints of the wage bill and public
pensions, has resulted in a significant reduction of the fiscal deficit. Growth resumed in 2011
and annual inflation has declined to record lows earlier this year. Unemployment remains high,
but labor market reforms have contributed to a better-functioning labor market and a recovery
in employment. Bank capital buffers have been shored up and contingency plans have been
prepared. Structural reforms in the energy and transportation sectors have progressed, albeit
slowly. These policy actions have helped to ease financing pressures and allowed Romania
renewed access to the Eurobond market.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2

Nevertheless, the post-crisis recovery remains fragile and the outlook is challenging. With
strong trade and financial sector linkages to the euro area, Romania remains vulnerable to the
regional economic slowdown. While the economy is expected to grow by 0.9 percent this year,
the growth momentum has been weak, and is lagging behind most other European emerging
economies. Difficulties in absorbing European Union structural funds and frequent delays in
advancing the structural reform agenda are weighing on the economy’s potential growth. The
weak recovery together with the so far moderate ongoing private sector deleveraging, mainly
concerning households, are impacting the banking system as nonperforming loans
accumulate, bank profitability continues to be low, and real credit growth remains subdued.
Heightened uncertainty owing to political tensions between the ruling coalition and the
President has taken a toll on investor confidence, leading to capital outflows and exchange
rate depreciation pressures. These developments along with rising inflationary pressures have
underscored the need for a prudent monetary policy stance. Strong commitment to achieving
fiscal sustainability and judicious implementation of the structural reform agenda remain crucial
to anchor policy credibility, ensure macroeconomic stability, and boost inclusive growth.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Romanian authorities for restoring macroeconomic
stability and reducing large external and fiscal imbalances. Directors noted however that the
difficult external environment and domestic political uncertainty are weighing on the economy.
They welcomed the authorities’ continued commitment to the program objectives, stressing the
importance of sustained policy discipline and accelerated implementation of structural reforms
to reinforce the economy’s resilience and boost its growth potential.
Directors commended the sizeable fiscal adjustment undertaken and welcomed the authorities’
commitment to stay within the 2012 fiscal target of 3 percent and reach the medium-term
objective by 2014. They recognized the significant progress made in reducing current
spending and encouraged continued restraint ahead of the upcoming elections. Directors
emphasized the importance of prioritizing capital outlays and improving EU funds absorption.
They also underscored the need to take remedial measures to reduce outstanding arrears and
avoid further accumulation of arrears, in particular at the local government level. Reform of the
healthcare system should help address medium-term fiscal pressures, while improving service
delivery.
Directors stressed that accelerating the pace of structural reforms is critical to fostering higher
and inclusive growth. They welcomed the progress on labor market reform and energy prices
but underscored the need for further action in the energy and transportation sectors, while
protecting the poor. Deeper reform and privatization of the state-owned enterprises and
improvements in the institutional and regulatory frameworks and the business climate are

3
priorities going forward. Directors also called for stepped up efforts to increase the
employment rate and reform the education system.
Directors underscored the importance of pursuing a prudent monetary policy stance while
maintaining exchange rate flexibility. They encouraged the central bank to limit intervention in
the foreign exchange market to smoothing volatility and to stand ready to tighten the policy
stance should exchange rate pressures persist. Directors noted that the Romanian banking
system maintains significant buffers to deal with the potential adverse effects of tensions in
euro area financial markets. They encouraged the authorities to continue to strengthen bank
supervision and the financial sector safety net, and mitigate the rise in nonperforming loans.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Completes Sixth Review Under the Stand-By Arrangement for Romania
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the sixth
review of Romania’s economic performance under a program supported by a 24-month
Stand-By Arrangement (SBA). The authorities have indicated that they will continue to treat
the arrangement as precautionary and therefore do not intend to draw under it.
Completion of the review makes an additional amount equivalent to SDR 430 million (about
€512.9 million, or about US$663.1 million) available for disbursement, bringing the total
resources that are currently available to Romania under the SBA to SDR 2.640 billion (about
€3.2 billion, or about US$4.1 billion).
The SBA was approved on March 25, 2011 (see Press Release No 11/101) in the amount of
SDR 3,090.6 million (about €3.7 billion, or about US$4.8 billion).
In completing the review, the Executive Board also approved a waiver for the nonobservance
of a performance criterion regarding central government and social security domestic arrears,
and the modification of the performance criterion concerning the net foreign assets of the
central bank.
Following the Executive Board’s discussion on Romania, Mr. David Lipton, First Deputy
Managing Director and Acting Chair, said:
“Romania continues to make good progress under the precautionary program. All
performance criteria and indicative targets were met except for the central and local
government arrears. Nevertheless, the economic outlook remains challenging due to the
difficult external and internal environments that have led to exchange rate pressures and
undermined confidence. Growth is expected to slow while inflation is approaching the upper
bound of the NBR’s target band. Steadfast program implementation is essential to preserve
the hard won macroeconomic stability, and boost investment and growth potential.

2

“The authorities have maintained strict spending discipline consistent with the goal of
lowering the budget deficit to 3 percent of GDP in 2012. Remedial measures to ensure a
decline in arrears remain a priority. A slowdown of capital outlays will be required in light of
the recent interruption of EU fund disbursements for some programs. Additional efforts are
needed to improve tax administration and reform the health care, energy and transportation
sectors. While progress is being made towards liberalizing energy prices, it will also be
important to step up the reform of state-owned enterprises.
“The banking system maintains significant buffers to deal with rising non-performing loans
and potential spillovers from elsewhere in Europe. However, the authorities should remain
vigilant and continue to strengthen the financial-sector safety net and contingency planning.
Intervention in support of the leu should be limited to smoothing exchange rate volatility.”

Statement by Mr. Menno Snel, Executive Director for Romania,
and Mr. Serban Matei, Senior Advisor to the Executive Director
September 28, 2012
The economic program, supported by the Fund, the European Commission, and the
World Bank, played an important role in stabilizing the Romanian economy, generating
concrete results in boosting growth and maintaining fiscal and financial stability.
Romania’s performance under the current program continues to be strong, and all
performance criteria for the sixth review were met, except for the one on accumulation of
central government arrears, which was missed by a small margin. The authorities
continue their efforts on accomplishing the goals of a broad structural agenda, with a
focus on reforming the healthcare sector and state-owned enterprises.
Recent economic developments
Romania’s economic recovery continues. Real GDP grew by 2.5 percent in 2011 on the
back of a very good harvest and thanks to a front-loaded pick-up in exports, which
however faded during the year. There was also some recovery in private demand, but it
declined by 0.2 percent in the fourth quarter (q/q) and by 0.1 percent in the first quarter of
2012. In the second quarter of 2012, GDP expanded 0.5% (q/q/) and accelerated to 1.2%
(y/y) in real terms with industry turning positive and constructions gathering pace,
rebounding from a seasonal dip. Economic growth is likely to be less robust than
foreseen, reflecting mainly the deteriorating external environment in the euro area and
spillover effects from financial market turbulence. Overall, growth in 2012 is expected to
reach around 1 percent, with downside risks.
The inflation rate reached record lows of 1.8 - 2.0 percent in the period April through
June. It increased to 3.9 percent in August, mainly driven by an expected reversal of
favorable base effects as a result of developments in food prices in the previous year.
These effects are amplified by exchange rate fluctuations, the impact of drought on
domestic agricultural output and an increase in international agricultural commodity
prices. We expect inflation to climb further in the second half of the year,
notwithstanding the persistent negative output gap. Due to the stronger upside risks for
the inflation outlook, the NBR has pro-actively stopped interest rate cuts since May and
maintained the policy rate at 5.25 percent, while adjusting liquidity conditions.
The external position has been consolidated. The current account deficit is expected to
be around 4 percent of GDP for 2012, lower than the levels registered in 2009-11, and is
seen as stabilizing at around 4.5-5 percent of GDP from 2013 onwards. In 2012, net
exports are expected to remain broadly stable, and official transfers are projected to begin
recovering.

2
Public debt issuance has been positive so far this year. The authorities successfully
tapped the external markets by issuing USD and EUR denominated bonds, extending the
maturities at competitive rates. Meanwhile, consolidation of the local currency yield
curve has been continued. The efforts to consolidate the fiscal buffers were continued and
in June the World Bank has approved a Development Policy Loan of EUR 1 billion.
Despite the progress achieved, the recovery remains vulnerable to adverse developments
in international markets, weaker-than-expected growth in Western Europe, and possibly
more rapid and less orderly bank deleveraging. Spillovers from the ongoing turbulence in
the euro area could dampen exports and affect capital flows to Romania. The authorities
will remain vigilant, act proactively, and take the necessary steps to contain these risks.
Fiscal policy
Since the first program started, Romania significantly improved its fiscal position and the
authorities remain committed to continue this process in 2013.
Under the new fiscal strategy, implementing further structural adjustments, the deficit
target in 2013 is set at 2.2 percent in ESA terms. Moreover, to achieve this goal the
authorities are committed to continue restraining expenditures and prioritizing investment
projects with a focus on EU-funded initiatives. They will also improve tax collection by
implementing measures to simplify the tax code and strengthen the tax audit and
enforcement efforts, based on the technical assistance recommendations from the Fund
and the Bank.
For 2012, the authorities remain fully committed to bringing the fiscal deficit below 3
percent of GDP in ESA terms, in compliance with the EU Excessive Deficit Procedure.
For 2013, the structural deficit will be reduced by at least 0.5 percent of GDP. To ensure
meeting this goal, the cash deficit target will be limited to 2.2 percent of GDP in 2012
and will require continued expenditure restraint and strengthened tax collection.
Personnel spending will remain at 6.7 percent of GDP in 2012, unchanged from 2011,
reflecting the continued strong decline in public employment.
After a year of declining arrears and unpaid bills in the general government, arrears
slightly increased in the second quarter 2012, being concentrated mostly in local
governments. To strengthen enforcement, the authorities conducted a thorough audit and
will undertake a comprehensive analysis of local government arrears to determine their
causes. A government ordinance has been issued to ensure that tax-sharing resources
available to local governments can be used for paying arrears and to allow the central
government to directly pay off arrears of local governments. The arrears in the SOE’s in
the first half of 2012 stood below the indicative target for that period, and the authorities
anticipate that they will be further reduced in the second half of 2012. In the health

3
sector, arrears in registered bills with the Health Insurance Fund have now been
eliminated.
Monetary policy
The monetary authorities responded appropriately to economic developments, and the
central bank has gradually and prudently reduced its policy rate amid abating inflationary
pressures in the first half of the current year. Since November 2011, the central bank
eased the rate by a cumulative 100 basis points while maintaining the reserve
requirements on local and FX currencies. Due to external uncertainties and a heightened
upside risk balance for the inflation outlook, the central bank decided in its May, June
and August policy meetings to keep the interest rate unchanged. It has also been
managing liquidity in the system through weekly repo auctions with banks. Lending and
deposit rates for non-bank clients, as well as interbank rates, have generally reflected the
cumulative reduction in the NBR policy rate.
Headline inflation was 3.9 percent in August as favorable food prices receded. Core
inflation continued to decline, reaching a low of 2 percent in March, but it has recently
increased somewhat due to expectations fueled by relatively more volatile exchange rate
dynamics, as well as by the impact of the expected increase of processed food prices from
last year’s lows. However, upside risks remain, including from additional adjustments of
administered prices and a stronger than previously estimated rebound of domestic food
prices. Nonetheless, inflation is expected to stay within the target band for 2013, after the
current volatile food price-related increase dissipates. In light of the gathering risks of
contagion from financial disturbances in the region and possible capital outflows, the
monetary authorities will remain vigilant against inflation risks and are committed to
taking action as needed to ensure the achievement of the medium-term inflation targets.
Financial sector
The Romanian financial sector so far has weathered well the impact of the economic
challenges. The banking system remains well capitalized, with an average capital
adequacy ratio of 14.7 percent at end-June 2012. Private sector credit has grown in
annual real terms by 4.1 percent through July. At the same time, non-government client
bank deposits grew annually in real terms by 6.7 percent through July. However, the NPL
ratio rose to 16.8 percent in end-June. Total prudential provisions at end-June were
sufficient to cover 98 percent of NPLs. In light of the current uncertain external
environment, the central bank remains vigilant to vulnerabilities in the banking system
and stands ready to provide liquidity, as necessary, to mitigate segmentation in the
interbank market. It has also broadened its range of contingency measures to be deployed
- if necessary - to preserve depositor confidence and consolidate financial stability.

4
Structural reforms
Under the current program the authorities are committed to reforming the state-owned
enterprises, especially in the transport and energy sectors, to enable sustainable economic
growth and better competitiveness. The authorities have made progress in the reform
agenda, but challenges remain.
In the transport sector, the authorities are continuing the implementation of the general
transport master plan, which will balance increasing demand and available fiscal means,
ensure complementarities between different transport modes and define priorities for the
medium and long-term investment.
In the energy sector, the authorities have taken a number of actions to establish a
framework to improve the sector’s efficiency. Electricity and gas legislation, in line with
EU energy directives, was adopted. The law on the energy regulator (ANRE) is expected
to be promulgated by mid-October 2012. Following the earlier approval of a roadmap to
deregulate electricity prices, a similar step has been taken for gas prices. This envisages
complete liberalization of gas prices for non-residential consumers by January 1, 2015,
and for households by October 1, 2018. Regulated electricity prices were also increased
by five percent at end-June.
An extraordinary step was placing the hydro-electric power producer, Hidroelectrica, into
insolvency in June, in view of its deteriorating financial position. The judicial
administrator has cancelled or renegotiated in market terms contracts at below-market
prices with the energy traders. Hidroelectrica will sell the electricity being released from
the cancelled contracts on the electricity trading platform (OPCOM).
To better align the currently regulated end-user prices of gas with the actual cost of
supply and distribution, the authorities have increased tariff rates for non-residential
consumers by ten percent and for households by five percent.
The authorities will continue the privatization agenda and accelerate implementation of
the SOE corporate governance Law. The process has already been started to appoint
professional boards and management for key SOEs that remain under majority
government ownership.
In conclusion, my authorities concur that the current precautionary Stand-By
Arrangement will maintain the reform momentum, provide additional security against
unforeseen risks, and build on the considerable progress achieved over the past three
years, thereby setting the stage for strong and sustainable economic development while
maintaining external and internal stability.
