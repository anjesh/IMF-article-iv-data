Staff Report for the 2009 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2009 Article IV Consultation
with the Lao People’s Democratic Republic
Approved by Shogo Ishii and Dominique Desruelle
June 24, 2009
• Discussions: Held in Vientiane during May 13–27 with Bank of Lao P.D.R. Governor
Khamphounvong, Deputy Minister of Finance Siphandone, Deputy Prime Minister and
Standing Member of Government Lengsavat, other senior officials, and private sector and
donor representatives.
• Team: Ms. Baker (Head), Mr. Ree, Ms. Bi (all APD), and Mr. Shin (FAD), and was
assisted by Mr. Bingham (Senior Resident Representative) and Mr. Ngaosrivathana

Ms. Vongpradhip and Mr. Nget (both OED) participated in policy meetings.
• Context of past surveillance: The conduct of fiscal policy has been broadly in line with
past advice. Fiscal transparency would be improved by bringing rapidly increasing extrabudgetary expenditure on budget. Advice on monetary operations, including moving
toward basic market-based instruments for domestic liquidity management, has had less
traction. On the banking sector, the reform program has advanced broadly in line with past
advice; however, the recent surge in credit growth risks unraveling gains.
• Exchange arrangement: Other floating, with no exchange restrictions under the
transitional arrangements of Article XIV, section 2. Lao P.D.R. maintains restrictions for
the preservation of national or international security notified pursuant to Decision
No. 144-(52/51) and a restriction subject to IMF approval under Article VIII. Draft
implementing instructions for the Decree on Foreign Exchange Management remove the
tax certification requirement, paving the way for Article VIII acceptance—approval is
expected in mid-2009.
• Data: Serious shortcomings that hamper surveillance, with the balance of payments and
national accounts statistics most in need of strengthening.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Over the past five years, the Lao P.D.R. economy has performed well, but the impact of
the global crisis is now being felt. The largest impact has been on the mining sector, but
delays in hydropower projects are also evident—foreign currency inflows have slowed
considerably. Growth is expected to moderate, but remain fairly robust, supported by large
projects in train, strong mineral exports, and expansionary policies. Inflation is expected to
remain low and stable, assuming no significant pick up in commodity prices. However,
overly expansionary fiscal and credit policies pose a risk to macroeconomic stability. The
external position is weakening, with international reserves steadily declining.
Provided that macroeconomic stability is maintained and structural reforms are
accelerated, the medium-term outlook is positive. As the global crisis works itself out,
investments in the mining and hydropower sectors would resume. Activity in the broader
economy is also expected to pick up, assuming that reforms to strengthen the foundations of
the economy are pushed forward. Although the external current account deficit is expected to
widen again as investment-related imports rise, this would be more than offset by increased
foreign direct investment and other capital inflows—the external position would strengthen,
with international reserve coverage gradually returning to current levels.
Discussions focused on policies to safeguard macroeconomic stability while supporting
growth. The authorities noted the temporary nature of the policy easing, and emphasized the
importance of achieving their ambitious growth target. There was broad agreement on the
medium-term structural reform agenda to strengthen the banking sector and improve the
business climate.
Prompt tightening of policies is required in the near term to reduce pressure on the
external position.
•

Fiscal adjustment should aim to eliminate the sizeable domestic financing gap and halt
the rise in quasi-fiscal liabilities. Off-budget operations and their financing should be
brought on budget—in this context, the Bank of Lao P.D.R. advances and loans to lower
levels of government should be curtailed. The 2009/10 budget should target a larger and
more permanent adjustment.

•

Strong signals should be sent to banks to rein in credit growth, including through a
significant increase in the required reserve ratio. This would not only help take pressure
off international reserves, but also avoid the building up future contingent liabilities of
the state-owned commercial banks in light of continued weakness in risk management
practices and slowing economic activity.

4
I. GLOBAL AND DOMESTIC CONTEXT
1.
Over the past five years, the Lao P.D.R. economy has performed well. Aided by a
booming global economy, large foreign direct investment (FDI) flows into the mining and
hydropower sectors stoked robust growth, with trade and retail services, light manufacturing,
and the nascent tourism industry also contributing. Stable macroeconomic conditions and
reforms to further the transition toward a market-based economy helped improve the
environment for economic development. Steady progress on poverty reduction has been made,
although there are indications that greater efforts are required to meet a number of MDGs.1
2.
While Lao P.D.R. has been weathering the global crisis better than many
countries in the region, the impact is being felt. Project delays have led to a reduction in
FDI, while the sharp drop in commodity prices has hit the mining and agricultural sectors
hard. High-end tourism has been impacted by weaker external demand, and inward
remittances and other capital flows appear to be on the decline. Growth is expected to
moderate, but remain fairly robust, supported by large projects in train, strong mineral
exports, and expansionary policies.
3.
Discussions focused on policies to safeguard macroeconomic stability while
supporting growth. In the near term reining in overly expansionary fiscal spending and
credit growth is crucial, while over the longer term the priority is to strengthen the
underpinnings of the economy through financial sector development, sound banking sector
practices and supervision, and creating an economic environment conducive to broader based
private sector-led growth.
II. RECENT MACROECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
4.
Notwithstanding external and weather-related shocks, economic performance in
2008 was broadly positive.
•

Real GDP growth moderated only slightly despite severe flooding which negatively
impacted agricultural production—construction and mining picked up the slack
(Table 1 and Figure 1).

•

Inflation came off its mid-year peak as food and fuel prices abated, aided by currency
appreciation.

•

The nonresource current account deficit widened, despite robust exports and tourism
receipts, due to the impact of soaring commodity prices on the import bill in the first
half of the year. However, international reserves increased by $100 million to

`Lao P.D.R.’s National Socio Economic Development Plan 2006-10 and Progress Report fulfill the main
required criteria for a poverty reduction strategy.

5
$636 million (3.4 months of prospective imports) buoyed by strong FDI inflows
(Table 2).
•

Banking sector reform continued, through strengthening of the state-owned
commercial banks’ (SOCB) balance sheets and banking practices, and the opening of
the sector to foreign banks. However, the system remains weak and financial depth,
low.2 Dollarization declined to about 50 percent (70 percent in 2003), supported by a
significant appreciation of the kip.

5.
More recently, the impact of the deteriorating external environment has become
increasingly evident.
•

Previously strong foreign currency inflows (into both the current and capital
accounts) have slowed. The decline in copper prices has impacted the mining sector,
lowering exports and depressing financial performance. In addition, tighter global
financing conditions have delayed expansion plans and new hydropower investments.

•

International reserves have fallen from their June 2008 highs, in defense of a strong
kip (Figure 2).3

•

Lower-than-budgeted profit tax collection from the mining sector is placing fiscal
revenues under strain (Table 3 and Figure 3).4

6.
Policies have become increasingly expansionary in support of near-term growth
and long-term development goals.5
•

On the fiscal front, domestically financed capital expenditure has increased rapidly—
both on- and off-budget (Table 3).6

2

The market share of SOCBs is around 60 percent. SOCB capital is positive for the first time in many years as
a result of recapitalization and improved profitability, but capital adequacy is still well below the statutory
minimum (end-2008). Financial depth is low, with a ratio of broad money to GDP of less than 25 percent.

3

Strong foreign currency inflows in the first half of 2008 led to currency appreciation and a significant
accumulation ($165 million) of foreign reserves by end-June through unsterilized intervention. Once foreign
currency flows abated, the continued pursuit of a strong currency to bring down inflation and further
de-dollarization led reserves lower—down some $95 million from end-June 2008 through end-April 2009.

4

Profit tax collection from the mining sector was budgeted at $120 million. This was subsequently marked
down to $80 million, and a payment schedule was agreed. The $40 million loss represents 0.7 percent of GDP.

5
6

Long-term development plans aim for graduation from low-income status by 2020 via sustained high growth.

The 2008/09 budget contained a sizeable increase in domestically financed capital spending. Off-budget
projects, which are generally carried out by lower levels of government, have surged.

6
•

Credit growth accelerated to 85 percent in December 2008—with direct lending by
the Bank of Lao P.D.R. (BoL) supplanting slowing credit to the private sector in the
last quarter of the year—and has remained above 80 percent through March 2009
(Table 4 and Figure 2).7

7.
The near-term outlook is mixed. Growth is expected to slow in 2009–10, but
remain robust. Economic activity is projected to grow at around 4½ percent in 2009
supported by projects already in train and strong public investment, with modest drag from
somewhat weaker tourism and declining rural incomes.8 Inflation would remain low and
stable, predicated on currency stability and relatively weak economic growth. With new
large-scale investment projects taking off at the earliest in late-2010, growth is expected to
only tick up in 2010 as the Nam Theun II hydroelectric dam comes fully on stream, with
continued softness in other sectors. With expansionary policies, export softness, and lower
FDI, the external position would continue to weaken.
8.
Risks to the near-term outlook are tilted to the downside. On the external front, a
weaker global economic recovery could further depress demand for tourism, garments, and
other exports. FDI in the mining and hydropower sectors could also be adversely affected.
On the domestic side, the main risk is that excessively expansionary economic policies may
jeopardize macroeconomic stability—a precipitous decline in international reserves could put
undue depreciation pressure on the kip and lead to a rapid return of high dollarization.
Continued strong credit growth could fuel inflation down the road. The next 18 months
appear particularly challenging.
9.
However, provided that macroeconomic stability is maintained and structural
reforms are accelerated, the medium-term outlook is positive (Table 5). As the global
crisis works itself out, investments in the mining and hydropower sectors would resume.
Activity in the broader economy is also expected to pick up, as reforms to strengthen the
foundations of the economy push forward. Although the external current account deficit is
expected to widen again as investment-related imports rise, this would be more than offset by
increased FDI and other capital inflows, with international reserve coverage gradually
returning to current levels. External debt is projected to remain high, but concessionality will

7

As credit growth to the private sector began to wane in the last quarter of 2008, the BoL increased its quasifiscal operations including direct lending and advances to SOCBs and state-owned enterprises (SOEs), as well
as to local governments, some of which were backed by issuance of BoL’s own bonds.

Rural incomes have been hit by lower agricultural commodity prices; a temporary closure of parts of the
border to agricultural trade (now resolved); and the recent shift to cash crops, which left farmers indebted and
unable to secure new credit.

keep public debt service manageable (Appendix 1).9 However, in the absence of front-loaded
fiscal adjustment, public domestic debt would increase significantly, albeit from a low base.10
10.
The medium-term outlook is also subject to risks. Risks to external stability derive
mostly from lower mineral prices. More broadly, improvements in the global economy—
while key to improving external demand conditions—may not be sufficient to ensure
sustainable growth and debt sustainability. Continued acceleration of domestically financed
public investment would increase the nonresource current account deficit, placing sustained
pressure on the external position. Postponement of necessary structural reforms, especially
those related to strengthening the banking sector and creating an enabling environment for
private-sector led growth, could reduce growth prospects and delay government withdrawal
from economic activity, both of which would hinder a reduction in public debt ratios.

III. REPORT ON DISCUSSIONS
A. Dealing with the Impact and Uncertainty of the Global Crisis through…
…Fiscal Adjustment
11.
Background: In recent years, fiscal consolidation progressed on the back of rising
budget revenue.11 Now, the outlook for mining revenues has weakened, expenditure is slated
9

Under all scenarios and stress tests, the net present value (NPV) of debt service—both to exports as well as
revenue—remains below indicative thresholds (Appendix 1, Table 1b).

10

Total external debt is around 100 percent of GDP, about half of which is public and publicly-guaranteed.
Private debt is mostly associated with large hydropower projects. The debt sustainability analysis (Appendix 1)
indicates that Lao P.D.R. remains at high risk of debt distress based on policy-contingent debt thresholds. Under
the baseline, the high, albeit declining, fiscal deficit implies a sizeable accumulation of domestic debt over the
medium term on the order of 8 percentage points of GDP. Domestic debt is estimated to be currently less than
2 percent of GDP.

8
to rise and quasi-fiscal liabilities have begun to increase. Identified extra-budgetary fiscal
operations relate to the long-planned hosting of the Southeast Asian (SEA) Games in
December 2009 and activities surrounding the 450-year anniversary of the capital city. The
BoL has played an active role in financing the extra-budgetary operations of lower levels of
government.12 Contingent liabilities associated with SOCBs also appear set to rise as a result
of rapid credit growth and slowing economic activity. On the positive side, modest measures
to enhance revenue are beginning to be implemented.
12.
Fiscal settings: In the absence of additional measures, the overall budget deficit
(including off-budget operations) is projected to widen to 7.8 percent of GDP in FY2008/09
(October–September) (2 percent of GDP in 2007/08). Most of the increase is explained by a
surge in expenditure of 5.2 percentage points of GDP in 2008/09, some 1.8 percentage points
in the form of off-budget spending. A decline in revenue also contributes.13, 14 In the absence
of additional external financing, substantial bank financing on the order of 4 percent of GDP
would be required to finance the deficit. This would be difficult to accommodate without
putting downward pressure on international reserves and crowding out the private sector. The
budget plan for 2009/10 is still under discussion; however, based on staff’s projections fiscal
year 2009/10 looks equally difficult. While a significant reduction in off-budget operations
and some revenue measures would bring the deficit down to 5.7 percent of GDP, the
domestic financing requirement would remain large—assuming no further run down in
government deposits, domestic debt, and other unidentified financing of some 2.7 percent of
GDP would be needed.
13.
Staff views: While a modest easing (along the lines of the original budget) of fiscal
policy in 2008/09 is warranted to support development objectives, the current fiscal stance
poses risks to macroeconomic stability and fiscal sustainability in light of rapidly growing
11

The increase in revenue reflects mostly higher mining output and mineral prices, as well as recentralization
efforts and administrative gains. During this period, expenditure was broadly stable.
12

The BoL has supported off-budget outlays by local governments through monetized direct lending
(0.6 percent of GDP) as well as on-lending of BoL’s own bonds issued for this purpose (0.6 percent of GDP). In
contrast, the extra-budgetary cost incurred in the building of the SEA Games stadium is reported to involve land
exchanges (1.2 percent of GDP) between the Government of Lao P.D.R. and the construction company
(equivalent to a non-debt creating asset sale).
13

Total revenues (excluding grants) are projected to decline by 1.3 percentage points of GDP relative to
2007/08, while grants are expected to increase by 0.7 percentage point of GDP. The revenue target contained in
the 2008/09 budget is ambitious due to lower mining revenues, and weaker profit tax receipts and customs
collection, which are being dragged down by slowing economic activity. The estimated revenue shortfall
(relative to budget) amounts to 2.1 percent of GDP, despite the recent introduction of specific excises on
petroleum products in May.
14

Revenue is vulnerable to a further decline in copper prices. For example, a decline of $500 per ton relative to
the current WEO baseline would reduce revenue by about 0.2 percentage point of GDP.

9
quasi-fiscal liabilities, the sizeable domestic financing requirement, and the weakening external
position. An adjustment of some 1–1½ percentage points of GDP through a combination of
revenue and expenditure measures would be required over the remainder of 2008/09 to
eliminate the financing gap, but would still imply a sizeable loss in international reserves.
Short-term expenditure savings may be possible through deferred hiring of new staff and
compression of non-priority current spending; rolling-back of fuel transfers; and reviewing and
cutting back on nonessential domestically financed capital expenditure. The remainder of the
adjustment might be secured by bringing forward revenue measures planned for 2009/10.15 The
2009/10 budget should target a larger and more permanent reduction in the deficit—including
through lowering domestically financed capital expenditure in line with realistic revenue
estimates—to close the sizeable financing gap, limit the increase in public debt, and eliminate
the nonresource current fiscal deficit. In light of the need for safeguarding social spending,
additional revenue measures and donor support should continue to be sought.16 All fiscal
operations and associated financing should be placed on budget.
14.
Authorities’ views: Additional sources of revenue are being pursued to make up for
the shortfall in mining revenues, including increased donor support. In May, the fuel tax
structure was amended and other measures will be considered by the National Assembly in
its June session. Efforts to strengthen customs collections on petroleum and automobile
imports (70 percent of customs’ revenue) are underway, with positive initial results.
Development needs call for maintaining budgeted expenditure. However, in light of current
difficulties a notification has been sent to ministries, spending units, and lower levels of
government to carefully consider new spending, while safeguarding necessary expenditures.
There is no scope to reduce wages and benefits, but postponement of non-essential spending,
such as new office furniture, is under consideration. While there may be a slight increase in
the debt stock over the near term due to exceptional circumstances, the government’s policy
of maintaining the debt on a downward path will continue over the medium term. Regarding
the financing of off-budget operations by the BoL, these are currently being reviewed and
will likely decline going forward. It is worth noting that while the expenditure is off-budget,
debt service payments related to off-budget operations will be incorporated in future budgets.

15

Planned measures include adjustments to the reference prices applied to imported vehicles; imposition of
additional alcohol and cigarette excises; and the restructuring of taxes and fees on luxury goods.
16

Revenue is projected to rise modestly in 2009/10, as higher collection of income and turnover taxes as well as
planned measures more than offset even lower profit taxes from the mining sector. Additional measures could
include strengthening the monitoring of large tax payers and broadening the tax base through a review of
deductions and exemptions. Moreover, preparations for a well-designed full roll-out of the VAT should continue.

10
…Tightening Monetary Conditions
15.
Monetary developments and conditions: Strong signals from the BoL to increase
lending resulted in a rapid expansion of credit.17 Credit growth rose to 63 percent by
June 2008, with the share of kip lending increasing to 40 percent (30 percent June 2007).
When foreign exchange inflows weakened and commercial bank lending began to slow,
credit growth was supported by continued easing and increasing BoL direct advances and
lending operations.18 Credit growth accelerated to 85 percent in December 2008 and has
remained broadly stable through April 2009, with a rising share of new lending going to
finance quasi-fiscal operations.19 Broad money growth has been more muted, tempered by the
decline in net foreign assets.
16.
Staff views: While some quantitative easing may have been justified, credit growth
has been excessive, posing risks to both macroeconomic stability and banking system
soundness, not to mention fiscal sustainability. Credit growth should be reined in, including
through curtailment of BoL quasi-fiscal operations and by sending a clear signal to banks,
including through a sizeable increase in the required reserve ratio. BoL lending should be
limited to temporary liquidity support for banks.
17.
Authorities’ views: Achieving the growth target requires greater bank lending. The
emergence of new banks as well as market-based mechanisms to signal monetary easing led
to the desired increase in credit growth. While credit growth has been high, it is from a small
base—the loan-to-deposit ratio remains low at around 50 percent. Nonperforming loans
(NPLs) have ticked up only slightly due to problems in one private bank. The BoL is keeping
a close watch over NPLs and has instructed banks to follow prudential regulations. The
economic slowdown has necessitated BoL direct lending and issuance of BoL bonds to
finance capital expenditure. These operations should be viewed as temporary.

17

While the effectiveness of market-based instruments is severely limited, in an effort to signal an easing of
monetary conditions the BoL reduced the required reserve ratio on kip deposits and increased the portion which
can be deposited in securities (both kip and forex); the policy rate was lowered 400 basis points to 8 percent.
There was also a modest contribution to growth from the entry of new banks.
18

Since mid-2008, the policy rate has been lowered on three occasions by an additional 300 basis points to
5 percent. The direct contribution of BoL advances and lending to credit growth is 24 percent (y/y, March).
19

As of March 2009, credit growth to the public sector accelerated to 166 percent (y/y) while private sector
growth slowed to 67 percent. The share of credit to the public sector rose to 23 percent (16 percent end-2007).

19.
Staff views: Maintaining foreign exchange market stability requires swift and
determined tightening of fiscal and monetary policies. The strengthening of the kip served the
Lao P.D.R. economy well in recent years, when the country was faced with large inflows and
inflation pressures, but conditions have changed dramatically. The tightening of policies will
protect the external position and provide scope for the exchange rate to continue to serve as a
nominal anchor until market-based monetary policy instruments can be put in place. The staff
share the authorities’ view that any sizeable adjustment of the exchange rate in the current
economic environment could trigger a reversal of recent gains in de-dollarization. Exchange
rate stability is also consistent with current CGER-like estimates which continue to indicate that
the exchange rate is broadly in line with its medium-term equilibrium level.21
20.
Authorities’ views: Strong capital flows led the kip to appreciate—this aided in
bringing down inflation and fostered home-grown de-dollarization. In the current context, top
priority is given to exchange rate stability. A flexible approach has been adopted, with the
kip fluctuating within a “soft target” five percent band in either direction relative to major
trading partners on an annual basis. Buying and selling are aimed at smoothing excess
volatility. Vigilance will be maintained over both the exchange rate and reserves in view of

Private foreign exchange bureaus can conduct foreign exchange transactions with the public for up to

daily trading band is ± 0.25 percent around the daily reference rate for the U.S. dollar and ± 0.5 percent for the
Thai baht and euro.
21

Estimates should be interpreted with extreme caution in light of incomplete data, limited observations,
structural changes to the economy over the estimation period, and the use of time series (not panel) data. The
macroeconomic balance approach indicates an undervaluation of about 4 percent, but is not statistically
significant. Results are broadly unchanged when the resource sector is excluded.

…Strengthening Policy Frameworks
21.
Staff views: The global crisis has put policy implementation capacity to the test.
Stresses surrounding the delineation of responsibilities among institutions is clear from rising
quasi-fiscal liabilities. Limited policy instruments and low financial market development
pose challenges to the conduct of monetary policy, while fiscal policy is vulnerable to
fluctuations in resource revenues. Capacity is in need of strengthening. As a first step, policy
implementation should be aligned with institutional mandates. With the BoL’s attention
squarely focused on the conduct of monetary policy, steps toward developing indirect policy
instruments, fostering a working interbank market, and strengthening domestic liquidity
management should be taken. On the fiscal front, the progress to date in public financial
management and the recentralization of tax, customs, and treasury operations (including the
Treasury Single Account) is welcome. Going forward, these efforts will need to continue. In
addition, steps should be taken to reduce vulnerability to resource revenues through a
broadening of the tax base, and to move toward a medium-term budget framework.
22.
Authorities’ views: Progress on de-dollarization and the strengthening of the banking
system support increased use of indirect instruments for the conduct of monetary policy in
the future. In light of limited issuance of treasury securities, consideration is being given to
floating BoL securities for the sole purpose of liquidity management. The BoL is
encouraging banks to use the interbank market, by taking on the role of lender of last resort,
but results have been very modest due to lack of quality collateral. Consideration is also
being given to new facilities such as foreign exchange swaps. On fiscal policy,
recentralization efforts are focusing on revenue sharing and budget allocation norms, and
VAT roll-out is planned for January 2010. A new chart of accounts and budget nomenclature
were incorporated into the 2008/09 budget process—work aimed at full implementation is
ongoing in close collaboration with the World Bank.
…Sound Financial Sector Practices and Supervision
23.
Banking sector reform program: Poor risk management, a legacy of directed
lending, weak monetary discipline, and lax bank supervision contributed over time to a sharp
deterioration in the banks’ balance sheets—a donor-supported reform program aimed at
strengthening banking oversight and restructuring SOCBs has been in place since 2003.
Results are becoming increasingly evident. The two largest SOCBs have met financial targets
set in the Governance Agreement which opened the door for bank recapitalization—capital

13
adequacy of the SOCBs has increased, and is positive for the first time in recent years, but
remains well below the statutory minimum.22 NPLs have been reduced through a series of
work out and write-offs. Some progress has been on strengthening banking practices, but
risk-management challenges remain. Profitability has recently improved.
24.
Staff views: Despite progress, financial intermediation remains low and the banking
sector weak. The legacy of directed lending is making it difficult to put in place banking
sector practices in line with international best practice and may compromise the financial
recovery of SOCBs, especially in view of increasing competition. In order for the banking
system to support private sector development and sustained growth, the financial position of
the SOCBs needs to be strengthened. Risk management and banking practices guided by
international standards should be strived for. In view of the increasing number of private
institutions, oversight capacity of the BoL needs to be strengthened, conflicts of interest
related to SOCBs minimized, strict due-diligence in the granting of new licenses exercised,
and cross-border supervisory collaboration increased.23 Full implementation of the
commercial banking law will provide a transparent and rules-based legal framework for
banking activity. A key developmental challenge will be to create an environment in which
banks can safely lend to small and medium enterprises on strictly commercial terms, an issue
which might appropriately be addressed in the broader context of the Financial Sector
Strategy which has been submitted to the Prime Minister.
25.
Authorities’ views: The BoL has stepped up onsite examinations and offsite
supervision, although capacity-related challenges remain. Improvements in banking practices
will be supported by the increased competition provided by the entrance of new banks, as
well as investments by strategic partners—talks are progressing with a strategic foreign
partner for the largest SOCB. Bank licensing is conducted in a two-phase framework of preand post-entry surveillance following proper screening, and consideration is being given to
increasing the minimum required registered capital to 300 billion kip ($35 million, currently
100 billion). The necessary laws and regulations associated with the 2006 Banking Law have
been issued; however, a draft implementing decree is needed to fill identified gaps in
subordinate legislation.
…More Balanced Growth
26.
Background: Broadening the sources of growth will reduce resource dependence and
support sustained economic activity. Over the years, good progress has been made in opening
22

Bank recapitalization bonds have been issued for 588 billion kip (1.3 percent of GDP) since September 2005.
As of end-2008 (latest available data), one SOCB had positive CAR of 2 percent, while the remaining two
SOCBs had negative CAR of less than -4 percent.

23

Conflicts of interest may arise due to the BoL acting as both owner and regulator of the SOCBs. Regarding
new banking licenses, participation of the Financial Intelligence Unit should be required.

14
the economy to private sector activity. Recent legislative initiatives—such as the Enterprise
Law, Mining Law, and draft Investment Law—are steps in the right direction toward
reducing discretionary regulation, leveling the playing field, and codifying business
practices. Ongoing efforts to reform SOEs are also welcome.
27.
Staff views: Despite advances, the cost of doing business remains high. Private sector
led-development requires economic openness, and transparent, rules-based regulation free
from cumbersome administrative requirements. The government’s role should increasingly
be limited to providing an enabling environment. As transition proceeds, priority should be
given to improving the business climate, including through establishing a transparent legal
and regulatory environment, and furthering trade integration.24 A strong commitment by
government is key—this could be demonstrated by swift revision of local laws and
regulations to be WTO compliant. Productivity gains would protect competitiveness and
avoid potential Dutch disease associated with large resource-related flows.
28.
Authorities’ views: The government is committed to furthering the transition to a
market-based economy. A legalistic approach is being taken—including the drafting of new,
WTO-compliant laws and regulations—in order to reduce regulatory discretion and level the
playing field. Efforts are ongoing, despite capacity constraints, through continued close
cooperation with development partners. The Investment Law will be considered by the
National Assembly in its June session, and implementation will proceed in line with WTO
accession preparations. Trade integration is evolving on two levels: meeting regional trade
commitments and actions toward WTO accession. However, the work program for WTO
accession is becoming more challenging in light of increasingly stringent demands placed on
Lao P.D.R. by member countries for granting accession.
C. Deepening Understanding of Economic Developments through…
…Improvements in Data
29.
Staff views: Macroeconomic and financial data shortcomings hamper surveillance
and impair the authorities’ ability to assess economic developments in the context of policy
formulation. Priority should be placed on strengthening balance of payments statistics in
order to better manage inflows and to identify and address vulnerabilities. Greater use of
direct surveys, improvements in collection and compilation methodologies, and increased
comprehensiveness would enhance the reliability of national accounts statistics. Recent
efforts to improve fiscal statistics should continue, especially broadening coverage to include
off-budget activities and SOE debt. More broadly, enhanced coordination among statistical
24

Specific actions relate to streamlining, simplifying, and clarifying existing regulations, especially in taxation,
to reduce regulatory discretion; creating a level playing field between state and private sector enterprises, as
well as domestic and foreign investors; and reducing red tape. The World Bank is taking the lead in this area.

15
agencies is required to ensure data quality and consistency. Data dissemination would be
greatly enhanced by GDDS subscription.
30.
Authorities’ views: While there have been some data delays, progress continues to be
made. The increased workload at ministries and agencies in the context of the global crisis has
slowed compilation of 2008 GDP statistics, while a new chart of accounts has led to delays in
the monetary accounts—both are expected to be resolved shortly. More broadly, national
accounts statistics have recently been compiled on an expenditure basis for 2002–05.
Continued work in this area will require increased funding to complete the required surveys.
Past technical assistance and training courses have improved capacity—at this juncture,
further gains to national accounts statistics require improvements in metadata.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
31.
Over the past five years, the Lao P.D.R. economy has performed well. Strong
resource-related FDI, a booming global economy, and stable macroeconomic conditions
supported growth, while reforms to further the transition toward a market-based economy
helped improve the environment for economic development.
32.
The impact on growth from the global crisis will likely be somewhat less than in
other countries of the region, but policies are straining the external position. While some
easing of policies was warranted, in the context of sharply lower foreign currency inflows,
overly expansionary fiscal and credit policies are placing downward pressure on international
reserves. Moreover, quasi-fiscal liabilities are mounting due to increasing off-budget
operations financed in part by the BoL and to rising contingent liabilities in the banking
sector fueled by rapid credit expansion.
33.
Macroeconomic stability should be protected through fiscal adjustment and the
reining in of credit growth. Revenue measures aimed at limiting the widening of the fiscal
deficit are welcome, but most of the required adjustment will likely need to come from the
expenditure side. Quasi-fiscal operations of the BoL should be curtailed and all fiscal
operations placed on-budget. A strong signal needs to be sent to banks to tighten lending.
34.
Prompt and determined tightening of fiscal and monetary policies is crucial to
foreign exchange market stability. While the strengthening of the kip served the economy
well when the economy was faced with large inflows and inflation pressures, changing
conditions have resulted in downward pressure on international reserves. Policy adjustment
will protect the external position and provide scope for the exchange rate to continue to serve
as a nominal anchor until market-based monetary policy instruments can be put in place.
35.
The global crisis has brought to the fore the need for strengthening policy
frameworks. Policy implementation should be aligned with institutional mandates, and
efforts to increase capacity should continue. The conduct of monetary policy would be
enhanced by development of indirect instruments, fostering a working interbank market, and

16
strengthening domestic liquidity management. On the fiscal front, ongoing recentralization
and public financial management efforts are welcome. Going forward, vulnerability to
resource revenues could be reduced through a broadening of the tax base, while budget
planning would be strengthened by a move toward a medium-term expenditure framework.
36.
SOCB reform efforts are yielding results, but the banking sector remains weak.
The decline in nonperforming loans and the return to positive capital adequacy are welcome.
Nonetheless, bolstering the ability of the banking sector to effectively support economic
growth requires further strengthening of the financial position of SOCBs and improved risk
management and banking practices. In light of the growing number of banks, BoL oversight
capacity should be reinforced, and conflicts of interest mitigated. Full implementation of the
banking law would provide a framework for sound commercial banking activity.
37.
Bold structural reforms are key to sustaining strong growth during the transition
to a market economy. Priority areas include improving the investment climate and advancing
trade integration. Establishing a transparent and rules-based environment will reduce
regulatory uncertainty, and furthering WTO compliance will promote a level playing field.
Such reforms, when taken together, will provide an enabling environment for private sector
participation and broaden the sources of growth, thereby reducing resource dependence.
38.

It is recommended that Lao P.D.R. remain on the 12-month consultation cycle.

Joint IMF/World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis 20091

June 24, 2009
This document presents the joint IMF-World Bank debt sustainability analysis (DSA) for
Lao P.D.R. using the Debt Sustainability Framework for Low-Income Countries (LIC).2
Lao P.D.R. is currently classified as a weak performer with regard to its policies and
institutions.3 This DSA assesses the impact of various exogenous shocks on the sustainability
of external and public sector debt under the baseline scenario.
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
The LIC DSA for Lao P.D.R. indicates that the country continues to face a high
risk of debt distress. The high level of concessionality of official borrowing keeps debt
service ratios relatively contained. However, public external debt stock indicators are
expected to remain at or above policy-dependant indicative thresholds throughout half of the
projection period under the baseline, and could increase further in the event of weaker
1

This DSA was prepared jointly by the IMF and World Bank, in consultation with the Asian Development
Bank (AsDB). The debt data underlying this exercise were provided by the Lao P.D.R. authorities.

The low-income country debt sustainability framework (LIC DSF) recognizes that better policies and
institutions allow countries to manage higher levels of debt, and thus the threshold levels for debt indicators are
policy-dependent. In the LIC-DSF, the quality of a country’s policies and institutions is measured by the World
Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) index and classified into three categories: strong,
medium, and weak. Lao P.D.R.’s policies and institutions, as measured by the CPIA, averaged 3.17 percent
over the past three years, placing it in a “weak performer” category. The relevant indicative thresholds for this
category are: 30 percent for the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio, 100 percent for the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio,
200 percent for the NPV of debt-to-revenue ratio, 15 percent for the debt service-to-exports ratio, and
25 percent for the debt service-to-revenue ratio. These thresholds are applicable to public and publiclyguaranteed external debt.

macroeconomic performance or greater accumulation of nonconcessional debt. The global
financial crisis has lowered growth prospects due to delays in investment projects and softer
external demand, and the external position has weakened.4 The fiscal position is under strain,
as are international reserves.
II. BACKGROUND AND ASSUMPTIONS
2.
Lao P.D.R.’s external public and publicly-guaranteed (PPG) debt stock remains
elevated. Strong economic growth, appreciation of the kip, and favorable external conditions
contributed to a decline in the debt ratio over the past few years—the stock of external PPG
debt in nominal terms was US$2.9 billion at end-2008, or 53 percent of GDP, down from
81 percent at end-2005. Nominal debt stocks also declined as share of exports of goods and
nonfactor services, from an estimated 241 percent at end-2005 to around 143 percent
currently. The corresponding net present value (NPV) of debt at end-2008 was 35 percent of
GDP or 91 percent of exports. Despite these improvements, Lao P.D.R.’s debt stock
indicators are generally above the policy-based indicative thresholds (Figure 1). Debt service
ratios, however, are below the indicative thresholds, reflecting the high degree of
concessionality of existing debt.

Around 69 percent of PPG debt in Lao P.D.R. is held by multilateral creditors,
mainly the Asian Development Bank (AsDB—39 percent) and International Development
Association (IDA—23 percent). About 29 percent is held by bilateral creditors—mainly
Russia, China, Thailand, and Japan.5 The remaining 2 percent of PPG external debt
comprises external debt incurred by public entities on nonconcessional terms and guaranteed
by the government, mainly for hydropower development and electricity generation, including
to finance equity stakes. As new emerging market creditors increase their presence in

Compared to the 2008 DSA, growth projections for 2009–11 have been reduced by about 2 percentage points on
average and the primary deficit in the near term is now projected to be nearly 3 percentage points of GDP larger.
Long-term growth is also assumed to be lower (by 0.5 percentage points on average), although foreign direct
investment (FDI) projections have been revised upward based on updated data on resource projects. Debt dynamics
are comparable, but somewhat less benign: debt levels are higher in the near term and decline more slowly.

5

The Soviet-era debt owed to the Russian Federation is currently under negotiation. The DSA makes no
assumptions regarding the outcome of the negotiations, maintaining the present value of the debt at its nominal
value throughout the projection period.

3
Lao P.D.R., the government should ensure appropriate concessionality from these lenders,
given its current indebtedness. This further underlines the need for the authorities to
strengthen the capacity in debt management and develop a borrowing strategy to ensure that
new debt is contracted with a view to maintaining debt sustainability.

4.
The size of domestic public debt is currently small, and comprises mainly
treasury bills and bank recapitalization bonds. At end-2008, the stock of recorded
domestic public debt amounted to 2.1 percent of GDP. Total public debt, including both
domestic and external, stood at 55.2 percent of GDP. Increasing off-budget public investment
by lower levels of government and quasi-fiscal operations will lead to a significant increase
in the domestic debt this year. Over the medium term, in the absence of an increase in
external donor assistance and/or fiscal adjustment, domestic debt is set to rise substantially.
The baseline scenario assumes that sizeable budgetary deficits over the next few years will
put an upward pressure on domestic debt, until fiscal adjustment leads to a stabilization of the
domestic debt stock at around 8–9 percent of GDP in the medium and long term.
5.
The baseline scenario is based on current policies. It incorporates the most recent
outlook for global growth in the face of the ongoing global crisis. In 2009–11, growth would
remain robust (averaging 6 percent), supported by large resource projects already under
construction as well as the loose fiscal and credit conditions. Over the medium term, growth
accelerates—some resource-related projects which had been placed on hold enter the
construction phase, and structural reforms aimed at fostering greater private sector
participation begin to take hold. As the transition to a market economy advances, private
sector-led growth is enabled by a restructured and vibrant domestic financial sector and an
improved business climate. External vulnerability is reduced as large resource sector projects
start generating export receipts (Box 1).
III. EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
6.
Under the baseline scenario, public external debt stock indicators remain at
elevated levels over the medium term, declining to the indicative thresholds only toward
the middle of the projection period (Figure 1 and Table 1a). The net present value (NPV)
of public external debt picks up slightly over the medium term before declining steadily to

4
20 percent of GDP over the longer term. Debt service ratios (both as a share of exports and
government revenues) fall continually and remain below indicative thresholds throughout,
despite falling concessionality.
7.
External debt sustainability is most vulnerable to a depreciation of the nominal
exchange rate (Table 1b).6 In the same way that the sustained strong appreciation of the kip
over the past couple of years served to bring the debt ratio down considerably, a 30 percent
depreciation of the kip would lead to a sharp jump in the NPV of debt-to-GDP and debt-torevenue ratios, which would remain above the respective debt stock thresholds through most
or all of the projection period. Indicative thresholds (both related to GDP and revenue) would
be reached only over the very long term. Lower export growth (by one standard deviation in
2010–11) would push the NPV of debt-to-exports up to double its baseline level over the first
half of the projection period and in excess of indicative thresholds throughout.
8.
Debt dynamics are considerably worse under an alternative scenario in which
key variables are at their historical averages. This is largely driven by the fact that this
scenario assumes that FDI remains at the historical average (2.7 percent of GDP), compared
to the medium-term baseline assumption (8.1 percent of GDP between 2009–14), implying
substantial additional debt financing. In case of a significant decline of FDI, all debt
indicators would rise steadily over the projection period and remain more than 50 percentage
points above indicative thresholds. However, the comparatively optimistic baseline scenario
is justified by the positive structural changes to the economy and significant improvements in
policy achieved over recent years.
9.
Lao P.D.R.’s external debt dynamics are highly sensitive to assumptions regarding
investment and performance of the resource sector. Large resource-related projects now
account for some 10 percent of GDP, with this share expected to nearly double over the
medium term. Under the baseline, the global crisis is assumed to delay the near-term investment
pipeline by two years, but leave unaffected construction of future planned projects. In addition,
profitability is expected to rebound in the medium term as global demand and prices strengthen.
Under a less positive scenario, lower growth would lead to a deterioration in debt dynamics.
IV. PUBLIC SECTOR DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
10.
Under the baseline, PPG debt is expected to rise over the medium term reflecting
a deterioration of the fiscal position and rising quasi-fiscal liabilities (Figure 2 and
Table 2a). In the absence of fiscal measures, revenue shortfalls—resulting from the global
slowdown and the impact of the global crisis on mining profits—and higher expenditure (both
on- and off-budget) lead to a large domestic financing requirement which cannot be met
through a drawdown in government deposits. Domestic debt rises from 2 percent of GDP in
2008 to around 8–9 percent of GDP in the medium term and stabilizes at that level in the long

burden indicator after 10 years.

5
term. As fiscal adjustment is pursued over the longer term—in part by constraining
domestically financed development expenditure in the face of rising domestic debt—PPG debt
declines to around 35 percent of GDP.
11.
The NPV of the public debt-to-GDP ratio rises over the medium term before
tapering off over the remainder of the projection period. The impact of the global crisis
on growth and fiscal revenues drives the near-term debt dynamics. The impact of expiring
grace periods and falling concessionality are offset by assumed fiscal adjustment, leading the
NPV of debt service-to-revenue lower over the projection period.
12.
Public debt ratios are particularly sensitive to a real kip depreciation over the
medium term (Figure 2 and Table 2b). The impact is somewhat less over the longer term. A
one-time 30 percent real depreciation of the kip exchange rate would raise the NPV of public
debt-to-GDP and public debt-to-revenue ratios to 58 and 370 percent, respectively. The
impact on the debt service-to-revenue ratio is relatively mild, leading to an increase to around
22 percent; however, this impact is more sustained over the longer term.
13.
Alternative scenarios point to less positive debt dynamics, especially over the
longer term. With key variables at historical averages, the NPV of the public debt-to-GDP
ratio remains elevated over the longer term. Assuming that the primary balance from 2009 is
maintained throughout the projection period would lead to a severe increase in debt ratios—
however, this alternative scenario is likely to overstate risks given the sharp deterioration of
the primary balance in 2009.
V. CONCLUSION
14.
While Lao P.D.R. has made progress in reducing its external and public debt
burden, it still faces a high risk of debt distress. Near-term debt dynamics deteriorate as a
result of the global crisis. Longer-term debt dynamics reflect current and planned large-scale
investments in hydropower and mining projects that will only deliver returns over the medium
term. The outlook is particularly sensitive to large swings of the exchange rate, highlighting the
importance of maintaining macroeconomic stability and deepening structural reforms.
15.
External borrowing should be obtained on concessional terms and fiscal and quasifiscal liabilities should be carefully managed, to further guard against the vulnerabilities.
Continued prudent debt management as well as cautious assessment and monitoring of largescale projects will be required to mitigate the risks posed to external and public debt
sustainability. Fiscal risk could arise if these projects fail to generate the expected returns,
including to the government’s own equity stakes. Improving debt management capacity and
developing a medium-term borrowing strategy for the government, including for resource
sector activity, as well as greater disclosure of borrowing plans, would substantially enhance
the assessment of debt sustainability.

Box 1: Baseline Scenario—Underlying Assumptions (2009–29)
• Real GDP growth is projected to average 6 percent during 2009–11 as the global crisis delays new resource
sector-related projects, and falling rural incomes and weak external demand weigh on growth. Support is
provided by large resource projects already under construction. Over the medium term, growth picks up
(6½ percent average) as construction of new large projects resumes, rising incomes (domestic and foreign)
boost consumption, and nonresource sector growth (mainly from agriculture, light manufactures, and tourism
and other services) picks up. Overall growth is relatively volatile as resource sector output is subject to
discrete changes as new projects come online or existing mines are exhausted. Over the longer term, assumed
structural changes and reforms would create an enabling environment, broadening the sources of growth.
Growth in the resource sector is expected to level off (about 6 percent), while nonresource sector growth
would rise to a sustained level of about 7.5 percent over the second half of the projection period. Over time,
the share of agriculture in GDP declines, as the transition to a market-based economy leads to an increasing
share of industry and services. Graduation from low-income status could be achieved in the second half of the
projection period.
• The external current account deficit is projected to narrow considerably in the long run. The nonresource
current account would deteriorate over the next decade reflecting the increasing cost of industrialization,
before moderating over the longer term. This would increasingly be offset by a shift to surplus in the resource
current account as large projects transition from construction to operation phase. The assumed pick up in
nonresource export and services is driven by strengthened competitiveness and regional integration, supported
by improvements in the investment climate, a streamlining of business regulations, and meeting trade
commitments. Notwithstanding its recent weakening, the overall external position is expected to strengthen
over time reflecting strong private capital and official inflows, and increasing international reserve
accumulation in the outer years as the resource sector matures and industrialization takes hold. Exports are
highly volatile due to the timing of production in the mining and electricity sectors, which respond for the
majority of exports. For example, exports decline by 21 percent in 2009 mainly because of lower prices for
copper before increasing by 29 percent in 2010 due to the coming online of Nam Theun II. Imports in the
resource sector are closely linked to the development of new resource projects. In the near term, FDI is in line
with the 2006–08 average as resource sector investments remain robust. Over the long term, resource FDI
declines, while nonresource FDI is assumed to grow at the same rate as the nonresource economy.
• External financing is assumed to remain largely on concessional terms. Over the long term, grant financing
decreases with economic development.
¾ Multilateral creditors: Projected loan disbursements in the medium term are relatively low since IDA and
the AsDB have a pipeline of operations financed on grant terms. Over the longer term, grant financing
decreases with economic development, leading once again to a moderate increase in project loans.
¾ Bilateral creditors: For 2009–10, projected loan disbursements increase as donors provide support to the
government’s development agenda. Over the medium and longer term, greater participation by new
emerging market creditors leads bilateral finance to take on an increasing role, including for on-lending
purposes to state-owned enterprises.
¾ Commercial creditors: Over the medium term, commercial disbursements are relatively small, principally
used to finance a portion of the government’s equity stake participation in new hydropower projects. This
includes the planned US$70 million bond issue backed by royalties from the Theun-Hinboun and Houay
Ho projects. Over time, as development continues and market access increases, commercial borrowing
takes on a larger role but disbursements remain below those of official creditors.
• Fiscal policy is expansionary in the near term—the public sector balance is expected to post a deficit of nearly
8 percent of GDP in 2008/09 (including off-budget operations), and remain elevated over the next few years.
The nonresource current balance turns negative, implying that resource revenues are used to fund current
expenditures. Under such a scenario, government deposits would quickly be depleted and domestic borrowing
would increase. Financing constraints and the rising domestic debt stock provide an impetus for adjustment—
in addition to a sizable revenue effort, a reduction in domestically financed capital expenditure leads to a
lower deficit in the second half of the medium term. Over the longer term, vulnerability to resource-related
revenue is decreased, as shown by a return of the nonresource current balance to positive territory.
•

Domestic debt increases over the medium term. Domestic debt is initially assumed to be composed of mainly
short-term debt (treasury bills) given the undeveloped nature of the domestic market for government debt. In
the medium term, the role of medium- and long-term debt is assumed to increase, comprising about half of
domestic debt.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt, excluding contingent liabilities.
2/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and r = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections, also includes contribution from price and
exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
6/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

Source: Staffs' projections and simulations.
1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), noninterest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline, while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming an offsetting
adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Safeguards Assessments

A safeguards assessment of the Bank of Lao P.D.R. (BoL) was completed in April 2003 with
respect to the PRGF arrangement approved in 2001. The main findings, recommendations,
and progress thereon were reported in Country Report Nos. 03/308 and 05/8. Progress on safeguards
recommendations has been slow. The authorities indicated that they were not in a position to
implement an earlier agreement to undertake a joint audit of the BoL’s 2003 and 2004
accounts by the state auditor and an international audit firm. These audits have subsequently
been completed by the state auditor, but the joint audit issue remains unresolved.
X.

Exchange Rate Arrangement

In September 1995, Lao P.D.R. officially adopted a managed floating exchange rate system.
The BoL sets a daily official reference rate, based on the weighted average of the previous
day’s commercial bank and interbank rates. Effective August 2007, banks are required to
maintain their buying and selling rates within ± 0.25 percent of the BoL’s daily reference rate
for the U.S. dollar (previously ± 1.15 percent), and ±0.5 percent for the baht and euro. For all
other currencies, commercial banks may not exceed a margin of 2 percent between the buying
and selling rates. Within the prescribed limits, commercial banks are free to set their own
rates. Under the IMF’s current de-facto classification system, the exchange rate regime is
now classified as an “other managed arrangement.”
XI.

Exchange and Payments System

Lao P.D.R. no longer maintains restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for
current international transactions under the transitional arrangements of Article XIV,
Section 2, but maintains restrictions imposed for the preservation of national or international
security, which have been notified pursuant to Decision No. 144-(52/51), and a restriction
subject to IMF approval under Article VIII (tax payment certificates are required for some
transactions). A joint LEG/MCM mission in August 2004 conducted a review of the
exchange system to establish the remaining measures that would facilitate Lao P.D.R.’s
acceptance of the obligations under Article VIII, including the elimination of an exchange
restriction on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions.

ANNEX II. LAO P.D.R.: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP1
IMF-World Bank Collaboration
The IMF takes the lead in advising the government of Lao P.D.R. on macroeconomic policy.
The support covers tax, fiscal, monetary, and exchange rate policies, and economic statistical
issues. The World Bank takes the lead in supporting the government in formulating a growth
and poverty reduction strategy and implementing structural reforms, such as in public finance
management; state-owned enterprise (SOE) restructuring; private sector development; trade,
legal, and judicial development; and natural resource management. The Bank and Fund
coordinate their work on some structural issues that have important implications on
macroeconomic performance, namely financial sector reform, public expenditure
management, trade policy, and poverty reduction strategy.
IMF and Bank Joint Role in Policy Dialogue
Poverty Reduction Strategy. The Bank and the IMF, together with the United Nations
Development Programme, have provided assistance to the government’s process of
formulating its medium-term poverty reduction strategy. In 2003, the government prepared
the first full Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, the National Growth and Poverty Eradication
Strategy (NGPES). The Bank and the Fund’s Joint Staff Advisory Note (JSAN) of the
strategy was presented before IDA and IMF Boards in November 2004. In 2006, the
government prepared the Sixth National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006–2010)
(NSEDP) with a strong poverty focus and through wide consultations with key domestic
stakeholders in Vientiane and provinces, as well as the Bank, IMF, and donors. The NSEDP
was presented by the government to its development partners at the 9th Round Table Meeting
in November 2006 and an annual progress reports were provided at a Round Table
Implementation Meeting in November 2007 and 2008. The Bank and the Fund’s Joint Staff
Advisory Note (JSAN) of the PRS/NGPES and the annual progress report was presented
before IDA and IMF Boards in June 2008.
The Bank is supporting the implementation of NGPES and NSEDP through the Poverty
Reduction Support Operations (PRSOs). The focus of PRSOs includes public finance
management reform, including in social sectors, and regional integration and private
sector development. PRSO-1 ($10 million) was approved in March 2005, followed by PRSO2 ($8 million) in April 2006, PRSO-3 ($10 million) in June 2007 and PRSO-4 ($10 million)
in June 2008. The second programmatic series of PRSOs (PRSO4-7) was approved by the
Bank Board in June 2008.

evostroknutova@worldbank.org.

6
Public Expenditure Management. The Bank has provided extensive technical assistance in
developing and implementing the government’s multi-year Public Expenditure Management
Strengthening Program (PEMSP). The Bank completed a Public Expenditure Review 2006
jointly with the IMF, other donors, and government, a Public Expenditure Tracking Survey
(PETS) for education and health sectors in 2007, and is currently undertaking a Public
Expenditure Review 2009. The Bank is also assisting the government in the preparation and
implementation of a Government Finance Statistics Manual-compatible Chart of Accounts
and the new Budget Law, focusing on improving inter-governmental fiscal relations.
Financial Sector Reforms. The Bank and the IMF have worked closely to support the
government in developing and implementing a banking reform program. The Bank has
supported restructuring of state-owned commercial banks (SOCBs) and drafting of banking
sector legislation, and is supporting the drafting of the Financial Sector Strategy.
Trade Policy. The Bank led preparation of the Diagnostic Trade Integration Study (DTIS),
jointly with the government, and other Integrated Framework donors. A Multi-Donor Trust
Fund (administered by the Bank) has been established to support the action matrix in the
DTIS, and a Customs and Trade Facilitation Project , designed in close collaboration with the
IMF to support customs modernization through implementation of an automated customs
system, was approved in June 2008.
The Bank’s Key Roles in Policy Dialogue
State-Owned Enterprises. The Bank has supported the government’s SOE reform and
restructuring program, aimed at improving transparency by institutionalizing the reporting
and recording of annual performance of all SOEs and through international standard audits of
large SOEs, restructuring them to reduce losses or raise profits for public utility SOEs and
reforming their pricing policies in water, power, and telecoms.
Private Sector Development. The Bank supports the development of the private sector, both
economy-wide and in the sectors, based on a joint AsDB-World Bank Investment Climate
Assessment of manufacturing and tourism firms, a review of key regulatory procedures and
business laws, and local government initiatives on private sector promotion. The Bank (the
IFC through its Mekong Private Sector Development Facility) is also a lead coordinator of
the public-private dialog through the semi-annual Lao Business Forum.
Forestry Development. The government is involved in a continuing process of reforming its
forestry sector and improving the implementation of forestry programs and projects. The
Bank is trying to ensure that the government’s strategy and objectives for forestry are
consistent with the NGPES, Rural Development Program, and Agriculture Development
Strategy.

7
The Nam Theun 2 Hydropower Project. The Bank has supported the project through an
International Development Association (IDA) partial risk guarantee, an IDA grant for
environmental and social mitigation, and a Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency
(MIGA) guarantee, all done in March 2005. The World Bank decision to support the project
was based on a “decision framework” with the following three pillars: (i) Lao P.D.R.
establish and implement a viable development policy framework, characterized by concrete
performance, and national programs for poverty reduction and social and environmental
protection; (ii) the technical, financial, economic, and implementation aspects of the project,
as well as the design and implementation of sound safeguards policies; and (iii) wider
understanding and broader support from the international donor community, and global and
local civil society for Lao P.D.R.’s development framework and the project. The Bank is
supporting and monitoring the implementation of NT2, and its progress remains good; it is
expected to be operational in early 2010.
Bank Strategy and Lending Operations
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). The full CAS was presented to the Bank’s Board in
March 2005, and the CAS update (and extension through 2011) in May 2007. The CAS
selectively targets key NGPES priorities, including: (i) sustaining growth through linking to
and capitalizing on regional opportunities and better natural resource management;
(ii) improving social outcomes through strengthening financial management and service
delivery capacity; (iii) strengthening management capacities, partnerships, and monitoring for
NGPES implementation; and (iv) implementing the NT2 program as a model for supporting
sustainable growth, improving social outcomes, and building key development capacities.
The updated CAS consists of a lending and non-lending program, with a notional amount of
about US$200 million in new commitments (grants) during July 1, 2005 to June 30, 2011
(subject to the IDA Performance Based Allocation system).
Lending Operations
As of April 1, 2009, a total amount of US$871.9 million equivalent of IDA credits and grants
had been approved. This included support for adjustment operations, rural development,
forestry, transport, customs, energy, telecommunications, education, health, industry, capacity
building, and risk guarantees. In the last three years, IDA support has focused on the CAS
objectives, with an average disbursement of US$31 million per year.

ANNEX III. LAO P.D.R.: RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK2
The Asian Development Bank (AsDB) has extended development assistance to Lao P.D.R. since
1968. In the 1970s and 1980s, AsDB assistance was focused mainly on economic growth
projects involving infrastructure development in the transport and energy sectors, as well as
agriculture. AsDB has been active in the development of the financial sector since the latter part
of the 1980s, and broadened its assistance to Lao P.D.R. to include rural development, social
development, and environment in the 1990s. AsDB has focused its activities on poverty
reduction since the late 1990s.
In early 2008, AsDB endorsed its new Long-term Strategic Framework or Strategy 2020 for 20082020 which provides a framework for the gradual realignment of AsDB operations. To reduce
poverty and improve living conditions and quality of life through inclusive growth, AsDB will scale
up its operations in support of (i) private sector development and private sector operations; (ii)
environmentally sustainable development, including reduction of carbon dioxide emissions and
projects to address climate change; and (iii) regional and subregional integration. In terms of sector
focus, infrastructure (including rural infrastructure), finance and education will receive priority.
Good governance and capacity development, gender equity, knowledge solutions and partnerships
will be drivers of change informing AsDB operations in the medium and long term. Strategy 2020
identifies five core areas of operations, namely (i) infrastructure, including rural infrastructure;
(ii) environment, including climate change; (iii) regional cooperation and integration; (iv) financial
sector development; and, (v) education.
AsDB’s current Country Strategy and Program for Lao P.D.R. for 2007–11 (CSP) is aligned with
the Lao P.D.R.’s Sixth National Socio Economic Development Plan, 2006-2010 (NSEDP).
A results-based strategy, the CSP focuses on (i) promoting pro-poor sustainable growth: nurturing
employment opportunities through private sector development (small and medium-sized enterprise
development, transition to commercial agriculture, and regional integration as the main engine of
outward-oriented growth); (ii) fostering inclusive social development: accelerating progress in nonincome MDGs (education, primary health care, water supply); and (iii) addressing priority
governance issues: building capacity for good governance and Nam Theun 2 Hydropower project
revenue management. The core of the strategy—a move to coordinated capacity development and
program and/or sector-based approaches in priority sectors—is supported by the Vientiane
Declaration on Aid Effectiveness and its associated country action plan.3, 4 The CSP is amplified by
ADB’s Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) strategy and program initiatives aimed at fostering
connectivity, promoting large-scale foreign direct investment, and creating regional public goods.

in Vientiane in November 2006.
4

The Government and development partners endorsed the country action plan on 31 May 2007.

11
These strategic foci are shaped by the country’s specific requirements and capabilities after
extensive stakeholder consultations. The CSP is designed to achieve high impact and sustainable
development results, and to contribute to the government’s MDGs and sector-specific commitments
as set out in NSEDP, with specific goals, targets, and progress indicators for AsDB interventions.
Lao P.D.R. is a key actor in the Greater Mekong Sub-Region (GMS) program as a land-link
among the other GMS member countries. The AsDB aims to explore various options to
maximize the benefits to Lao P.D.R. from sub-regional cooperation. To enhance the
development impact of projects and ensure their close monitoring, AsDB’s interventions will
focus primarily on the poor northern regional provinces and along the East-West economic
corridor that links Thailand to Savannakhet in Lao P.D.R. and to Vietnam.
Since 1970, the AsDB has approved 76 loan and grant financed projects for a total of
$1.27 billion—of which 25 projects were currently active―and 235 technical assistance projects
for a total of $122.8 million (as of end December 2008).
In 2007, AsDB program operations shifted to 100% grant. Two grants were approved in 2008
comprising of JFPR for Alternative Livelihood for Upland Ethnic Group in Houaphan Province
and GMS Sustainable Tourism Development amounting to 1.8 million and 10.0 million,
respectively. In addition, 9 TA projects amounting to $3.5 million were approved. In 2009 AsDB
approved 2 grants totaling $43 million and expects to approve another 3 totaling 45 million in the
later half of 2009 (a total of $88 million) and 9 TAs amounting to $4.7 million. In addition AsDB
proposes to approve $42 million ($22 million grants and $20 million concessional loan) for
regional projects which Lao PDR is party to. Lao PDR’s share would be $7.67 million.

ANNEX IV. LAO P.D.R.: STATISTICAL ISSUES
As of June 24, 2009
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Macroeconomic and financial data provided to the Fund have serious shortcomings that
significantly hamper surveillance. Priority should be placed on strengthening balance of payments statistics
and national accounts, as well as external public debt and subnational fiscal accounts. Improvements in
timeliness and accuracy are required. Greater coordination between the various agencies responsible for
compiling macroeconomic statistics is also needed. While a General Data Dissemination System (GDDS)
coordinator has been appointed, the authorities have yet to finalize the GDDS metadata and a strategy for
statistical improvement. Macroeconomic and financial data are published in periodic reports by the
National Statistical Center (NSC) and the Bank of Lao P.D.R. (BoL).
National Accounts: National accounts comprise annual estimates of GDP by activity at current and
constant 2002 prices, broadly following the System of National Accounts 1968. The lack of regular surveys
and use of inadequate methods to collect and compile comprehensive data on current economic activities
limit the coverage and reliability of the GDP estimates. The estimates rely heavily on production and
volume indicators collected by line ministries. With support from the Swedish International Development
Agency, the Lao Expenditure and Consumption Survey 2002–03 (LECS) was finalized and released in
2005. In recent years, the NSC has made some progress in improving the quality of source data, including
the implementation of annual enterprise and household surveys. In late 2006, a Statistics Department
(STA) regional advisor identified data gaps in the source data and issues on data quality, which need to be
addressed as well as in estimates of deflators and expenditures.
Price statistics: The NSC compiles a monthly CPI, with the latest basket introduced in January 2006 using
the results of the 2002/03 LECS. Similar to earlier CPI series, the consumption basket only includes goods
and services purchased in the market (i.e., excludes own consumption). Progress on compiling a producer
price index has stalled.
Government finance statistics: The Ministry of Finance’s (MOF) Budget Department produces monthly,
quarterly, and annual revenue, expenditure, financing, and government debt statistics. Most data are
recorded on a cash basis. Data on external and domestic debt are compiled by the MOF’s External
Financial Relations Department and Budget Departments. Debt data are comprehensive and available by
type of debt holder and instrument. Efforts are ongoing to further improve debt data coverage, particularly
relating to state-owned enterprises’ debt. The 2009 GFS technical assistance mission made
recommendations to bring the valuation of stock and flow foreign debt data in local currency in line with
international standards.
Overall, government finance statistics remain weak, with significant scope to improve their accuracy,
transactions coverage, and timeliness. Greater decentralization in 2000/01 further complicated the timely
reporting of fiscal data, as provincial monitoring systems are weak and skilled staff limited. Off-budget
activities are also not included in fiscal data.
Annual budget and outturn data formats do not follow international standards. Over the past few years, the
Lao authorities have embarked on accounting and chart of accounts reforms, and established the Finance
Statistics Division (FSD) in the Fiscal Policy Department of the Ministry of Finance, which is responsible
for the compilation and dissemination of fiscal data according to international standards. In early 2008,

13

staff from the FSD attended a GFS Workshop in Bangkok, Thailand, where work was initiated on mapping
monthly and annual fiscal source data (on an aggregated basis) to the Government Finance Statistics
Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001) framework. These data have been reported and published in the GFS
Yearbook and IFS. Reporting of data for publication in IFS has been irregular. Except for the annual data
disseminated in the Official Gazette, no fiscal data are disseminated in the country. The 2009 GFS
technical assistance mission’s recommendations were aimed at (1) enabling the authorities to compile
more detailed quarterly and annual fiscal data in the GFSM 2001 framework, and (2) the regular
dissemination these data on the MOF’s website and to the IMF.
Monetary statistics: The monetary and financial statistics mission in 2004 identified a number of
problems in the compilation of monetary statistics and made further recommendations on sectorization,
classification, and valuation. It also proposed improvement in the chart of accounts for BoL and
commercial banks, and reconciliation of monetary and government finance statistics. Many of the
recommendations of the mission have yet to be implemented, including those related to sectorization of the
commercial bank balance sheet. In addition, the authorities have not submitted test data in the format of
Standardized Report Forms that embody the methodology of the Monetary and Financial Statistics
Manual. Financial soundness indicators should be compiled and published.
Balance of payments: Balance of payments (BOP) statistics are compiled on a quarterly and annual basis
by the BoL, with inputs from the NSC, MOF, and Ministry of Planning and Investment, as well as
commercial banks. Currently, certain major activities are unreported, with improvements needed in all
major categories of the current account, as well as foreign direct investment and private capital flows. Data
reconciliation as reported in the fiscal accounts and BOP on external loans and grants also needs to be
strengthened.
New customs procedures adopted in 2000 by the MOF’s Customs Department (with Fiscal Affairs
Department technical assistance) have yet to produce more accurate trade data on a regular basis, due to
technical reasons. More timely and accurate BOP estimates also require improved coordination among
agencies involved in their compilation. The government of Japan is providing technical assistance to
address some of these issues.
The BoL reports to the STA quarterly BOP data once a year in a highly aggregated format that makes
difficult their re-dissemination through STA’s publications (International Financial Statistics and Balance
of Payments Statistics Yearbook). The last published data correspond to 2007.

II. Data Standards and Quality
Not a General Data Dissemination System
participant.

No data ROSC is available.

III. Reporting to STA (Optional)
Quarterly and annual GFS statistics for Lao PDR appeared in the Fund’s publications in the second half of
2008. However, subsequent reporting of quarterly data for publication in IFS has been irregular. Except for
the fiscal data reported to APD and the annual data compiled by the Budget Department (disseminated in
the Official Gazette), no fiscal data are disseminated.
No monetary data are currently reported to STA for publication in the International Financial Statistics.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
September 11, 2009

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2009 Article IV Consultation with
the Lao People’s Democratic Republic
On July 10, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with the Lao People’s Democratic Republic.1
Background
Macroeconomic performance of the Lao P.D.R. economy was broadly positive in 2008,
in spite of external and weather-related shocks. GDP growth moderated only slightly
despite severe flooding which negatively impacted agricultural production, with
construction and mining picking up the slack. Activity was further supported by a surge
in credit growth. Inflation came off its mid-year peak as food and fuel prices abated,
aided by continued currency appreciation. The nonresource current account deficit
widened, despite robust exports and tourism receipts, due to the impact of soaring
commodity prices on the import bill in the first half of the year, but this was more than
offset by strong foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows.
More recently, the impact of the deteriorating external environment, which began to
show in the second half of 2008, has become increasingly evident. The largest impact
has been through the mining sector, but other sectors such as tourism, remittances and
agriculture have also been affected. Previously strong foreign currency inflows (into both

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities.

the current and capital accounts) have slowed. The decline in copper prices together
with tighter global financing conditions has lowered export revenue, depressed financial
performance, and delayed mining expansion plans. New hydropower investments have
also been delayed. Lower-than-budgeted profit tax collection from the mining sector has
placed fiscal revenues under strain.
The external position has weakened in the face of slowing foreign currency inflows and
loose policies. International reserves have fallen from their June-2008 highs, as FDI
flows and exports weakened, in the context of a strong and stable exchange rate.
Growth will likely hold up much better than in some other countries in the region,
assuming no further negative shocks. Economic activity is projected to grow at around
4½ percent in 2009 supported by projects already in train, rapid past credit expansion,
and strong public investment, with modest drag from somewhat weaker tourism and
declining rural incomes. Inflation would remain low and stable, predicated on currency
stability and flat commodity prices. With new large-scale investment projects taking off at
the earliest in late-2010, growth is expected to only tick up in 2010 as Nam Theun II
comes on stream, with continued softness in other sectors. The external position would
continue to weaken, as expansionary policies, export softness, and lower FDI drive
international reserves lower.
Risks to the near-term outlook are both external and domestic. On the external front, a
weaker global economic recovery could further depress demand for tourism, garments,
and other exports. Foreign direct investment in the mining and hydropower sectors
could also be adversely affected. On the domestic side, the main risk is that excessively
expansionary economic policies may jeopardize macroeconomic stability. The next
18 months appear particularly challenging.
However, provided macroeconomic stability is maintained and structural reforms are
accelerated, the medium-term outlook is positive. As the global crisis works itself out,
investments in the mining and hydropower sectors would resume, and activity in the
broader economy would pick up, as reforms to strengthen the foundations of the
economy push forward. Although the external current account deficit is expected to
widen again as investment-related imports rise, this would be more than offset by
increased FDI and other capital inflows—the external position would strengthen, with
international reserve coverage gradually returning to current levels. External debt is
projected to remain high, but concessionality should keep public debt service
manageable. That said, improvements in the global economy, while key to improving
external demand conditions, may not be sufficient to ensure sustainable growth. For
this, strong policies and structural reforms are required.

Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for their economic management and
structural reforms, which contributed to the recent robust economic growth,
notwithstanding the severe flood and a deteriorating external environment. Directors
noted that, while Lao P.D.R. has weathered the global crisis well relative to neighboring
countries, expansionary policies have placed the external position under strain. An
immediate priority is to safeguard macroeconomic stability, while supporting growth.
Directors supported the exchange rate as a nominal anchor, until market-based
monetary policy instruments can be put in place. They stressed that prompt and
determined tightening of fiscal and monetary policies would be necessary to support
exchange rate stability. They noted the staff’s assessment that the real effective
exchange rate is broadly in line with its medium-term equilibrium.
Directors emphasized the need to reduce the fiscal deficit, to curtail quasi-fiscal
operations, and to bring all fiscal operations on budget. They welcomed steps to boost
revenue and the plan to bring forward revenue measures. Directors noted however that
expenditure restraint, including postponement of non-priority spending, would need to
bear most of the consolidation burden in order to create fiscal space to protect spending
for social programs. Directors welcomed efforts to improve public financial management
and to recentralize tax, customs, and treasury operations. They encouraged efforts to
reduce vulnerability to resource revenues by broadening the tax base, and to strengthen
budget planning by introducing a medium-term expenditure framework. Directors
stressed the importance of prudent debt management, given the country’s high risk of
debt distress.
Directors encouraged the Bank of Lao P.D.R. to rein in bank credit growth, and to limit
its lending to temporary liquidity support for banks. They recommended that steps be
taken to improve the effectiveness of monetary policy, focusing on developing indirect
instruments, fostering an interbank market, and strengthening domestic liquidity
management.
Directors encouraged further efforts to deepen financial intermediation and address
weaknesses in the banking sector, particularly the financial positions of state-owned
commercial banks. This would require sound risk management and banking practices,
improved supervisory oversight capacity, and full implementation of the banking law.
Directors noted that bold structural reforms are key to achieving sustained growth.
Priorities in this area include improving the investment climate, reducing regulatory
uncertainty, and advancing trade integration. These reforms will help expand private
sector participation and diversify the sources of growth. Directors looked forward to
furthering World Trade Organization compliance.

4
Noting shortcomings in data provision for surveillance, Directors called on the authorities
to improve the quality and timeliness of various statistics, drawing upon technical
assistance from the Fund. Enhanced coordination among statistical agencies would help
ensure data consistency.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country (or
countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations with
member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program monitoring,
and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements. PINs are
also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise decided by
the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat Reader to view
