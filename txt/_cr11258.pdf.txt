STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2011 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
July 7, 2011

KEY ISSUES
Context: The authorities face the dual challenge of sustaining the ongoing recovery while
rebuilding policy space, and raising potential growth and labor intensity of growth to help
reduce the extremely high levels of unemployment and inequality.
Growth prospects: Growth should rise to 4 percent a year in 2011 and 2012, underpinned
by solid domestic demand.
Focus: The discussions centered on the timing and strength of the required exit from
supportive policies in the context of large capital inflows. There was broad agreement that
barring a pronounced increase in core inflation or inflation expectations policy rate
increases could be put off given the still uneven nature of the recovery and the uncertain
global environment. Staff recommended stronger fiscal consolidation beyond the current
fiscal year than currently being considered, and rebalancing the composition of public
spending to help support higher potential growth.
Structural reforms: Policies to moderate real wage growth and increase product market
competition will be critical to reverse the large job losses of recent years and make inroads
into reducing high structural unemployment.
Financial stability: Banks have rebuilt their capital and liquidity cushions, but low credit
demand has lowered profitability. The main risks remain banks’ dependence on domestic
short-term wholesale deposits and high household indebtedness.
External vulnerability: Relatively low public and external debts, mainly denominated in
domestic currency, and adequate international reserve coverage offset risks from currency
overvaluation and current account deficits funded by portfolio flows.

by solid domestic demand. Private
consumption growth should remain robust,

interest rate environment. Private investment
growth, too, should accelerate, with the pickup in
overall activity and the lifting of the moratorium
on the issuance and renewal of mining licenses.

SOUTH AFRICA

Staff welcomed the explicit fiscal

guidelines expected to inform fiscal policy
formulation going forward. The 2011 Budget
proposed that fiscal policy be guided by three
principles: long-term public debt sustainability,
countercyclicality, and intergenerational
equity. These principles have been applied to
the design and implementation of fiscal policy
in South Africa since 1994. In the staff’s view,
they would also be consistent with a faster
consolidation over the medium term than is
implied in the trajectory for government
deficits presented in the 2011 budget review.

Authorities’ Views
19.

The authorities affirmed their

against recent losses. More broadly, they felt that
a debt-to-GDP ratio of 40 percent or lower
would be reasonable for South Africa to
maintain, given its development needs and
ability to finance its deficit relatively easily in
domestic currency and at long-term maturities.

20.

The authorities also pointed to a

number of reforms underway to enhance the
effectiveness and efficiency of public
spending. In particular, they noted that before
public investment could be increased decisively,
the absorption capacity of municipalities and
provinces needed to be addressed. At the
provincial level, increasing capital spending to

The authorities argued that the timing

for the first hike was unclear given the
prevailing uncertainty. They still perceived slack

concerned about the global recovery and its
implications for South Africa. They did not rule

On balance, staff favored waiting for

spreading to the general price level.

barring slippages, fiscal policy both in the
near and medium term should be tighter
than currently envisaged.

Authorities’ Views

29.

The authorities argued that a range of

measures need to be used to deal with inflows
and that this has very much been the
approach followed over the last year. Reserve
accumulation over the last year was significantly
more than ever undertaken before and measures
to restrict resident’s ability to move funds abroad
were eased as part of a strategy of gradually
moving from administrative exchange controls to
prudential measures for addressing crossborder
risks. Going forward, further reserve
accumulation would continue. But they stressed
that reserves were adequate from a prudential
perspective: cross-country comparisons focusing
on reserves as a ratio to GDP were unfair to
South Africa because the lion’s share of external
liabilities are denominated in local currency. In

interest-only cost of 0.18 percent of GDP for
each US$10 billion increase in reserves. They also
pointed to their intention to gradually alter the
fiscal-monetary mix. The monetary authorities
noted that providing fiscal policy is made
sufficiently countercyclical and the wage restraint
and better alignment between productivity and
wages called for in the NGP takes place, there
would be more scope for lower interest rates
than would otherwise be the case. As for CFMs,
the authorities agreed with staff that their
effectiveness is questionable. Moreover, they
stressed the need to take a close look at each
country’s circumstances in deciding on the
adoption of CFMs. In South Africa, curtailing
inflows while the country is also relying on them
to finance domestic consumption and investment
would be problematic.

addition, accumulation entails considerable
costs—according to staff estimates, around an

REFORMING PRODUCT AND LABOR MARKETS
30.

Job creation dominates the economic

and political agenda. The core objective of the
New Growth Path (NGP), launched in November
2010, is the ambitious target of creating five
million jobs and reducing the unemployment
rate by 10 percentage points in the next decade.
If successful, it would raise the employment to
working-age population ratio to 50 percent.

31.

Staff endorsed the focus on job

creation, and stressed that reforming both
product and labor markets would be key to

labor intensity of growth. There was broad
agreement that meeting the jobs creation target
would require either higher economic growth or
more labor-intensive growth. Staff work
suggests that with sustained economic growth
of 6–7 percent, the ½ million jobs per year
should be manageable even with current levels
of job-intensity. But with growth rates of about
4 percent, which are more likely in the next few
years, reforms to improve the labor intensity of
growth are essential (Appendix III).

Authorities’ Views

36.

The authorities pointed to the many

initiatives underway to raise potential growth,
including in the labor and product markets.
They also argued that the cost of hastily
designed structural reforms can be high. A lot of
emphasis thus needs to be placed on ensuring
that the reforms will deliver the desired results.
Beyond careful design of reforms, there is often a
need to build consensus around reforms and this
too takes time. They pointed to the range of
reforms currently underway. The competition
commission is aggressively tackling anticompetitive practices in key industries. They

however saw little scope for further trade
liberalization, noting that the average tariff level
at the moment is fairly low reflecting the
aggressive liberalization that took place under
the Uruguay Round, where South Africa
participated as a developed country. The need to
better align productivity and wage increases is
also recognized, and is an objective outlined in
the New Growth Path. Initiatives such as the
youth wage subsidy outlined in the 2011 budget
would help better align pay and productivity for
new job market entrants. In addition, the budget
also provides support for private initiatives with a
strong job-creating component.

the output gap is significantly affected by policy

and the change in public consumption (as a

economic cycles has increased steadily in the
past decade. This finding points to South
Africa’s increasing economic integration into the
global economy in recent years, and as corollary,
the growing sensitivity of the economy to global
economic shocks.

looser monetary policy characterized by lower

Would a tighter fiscal, looser monetary, and
greater reserve buildup increase growth and
depreciate the rand in real terms? The existing
empirical and theoretical literature would say
“maybe.” Such a policy mix would reduce
macroeconomic vulnerabilities and help prevent
financial crises that set back macroeconomic
progress. But such a policy mix does not
guarantee higher growth or competitiveness
even under steady external conditions.
A fresh look at the experience of South Africa
and its peers over the last twenty years, through
the lens of several econometric techniques,
concludes the same. These techniques range
from cross-section regressions to panel and
South-Africa specific dynamic systems. They
suggest that higher public spending contributed
to growth, but this effect was partly offset by the
adverse effect of higher public revenue and
public debt. Taking the cross-country parameters
at face value, a country that increased public
spending and revenue in the same amount

real interest rates tends to increase growth in the
medium run and depreciate the domestic
currency in real terms. Finally, reserve
accumulation seems to have contributed to
higher growth, even if it is associated with
stronger domestic currencies in real terms. A
South Africa specific dynamic system, however,
suggest that at least during 2003–2010, such a
change in the policy mix would have delivered a
more depreciated rand in real terms.
The Global Integrated Monetary and Fiscal
Model (GIMF) simulations support the
conclusions that fiscal tightening tends to
contract economic activity and has ambiguous
effects on the real exchange rate. It also shows
that funding and the composition of fiscal
spending matters for growth, with cuts in public
investment hurting growth the most. It also
shows that the monetary policy reaction is crucial
for determining the macroeconomic impact of
fiscal measures. The model does illustrate that a
fiscal tightening may be expansionary if it
reduces the risk premium, lowering policy rates.

DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
56.

South Africa’s external debt is

projected to reach 32 percent of GDP by
2016. The 8½ percentage point increase in the
external-debt-to-GDP ratio reflects a widening
of the current account deficit to around 6
percent of GDP in 2014-16. The current
account balance should weaken as growth
buoys import demand, recent gains in the
terms of trade partly unwind, and rising profits
and interest rates spur dividend and interest
outflows. A large share of the deficit will be
financed by nonresident portfolio investment
(around three-quarter of the total over the
medium term). This includes portfolio equity
(which do not add to the debt stock), and
local-currency bonds, with only a small share
expected to come from foreign-currency
denominated debt. The public-sector
borrowing requirement is expected to be
financed partly by nonresidents through
international bond issues, purchases of
domestic bonds, and multilateral loans for
infrastructure projects.
57.

The rising external-debt ratio

increases South Africa’s vulnerability to
external shocks and rollover risk, although
risks look manageable. Stress tests indicate
that the largest adverse impacts would arise
from a 30 percent rand depreciation, or from a
further widening of the noninterest current
account deficit. These shocks would push the
external-debt ratio to 43 percent and 39

percent respectively by 2016. But these are
likely to represent upper bound estimates,
since the standard DSA does not capture the
effect of a likely exchange rate weakening if
those shocks were to materialize, which could
lead to a narrower trade deficit. By contrast, a
large (one standard deviation) permanent
shock to real GDP growth and the standard
shock to interest rates have only minor effects,
while the combined shock has a moderate
effect on external debt levels.
58.

South Africa’s public debt position

appears sustainable. Under the policies the
medium-term expenditure framework outlined
in the 2011/12 budget, the ratio of
government debt to GDP is expected to rise
over the short term, to a maximum of
38 percent in 2013 from 35 percent in 2010—
of which, some 3 percent of GDP is expected
to be denominated in foreign currency—
before declining gradually thereafter (Table 2).
Gross financing needs peaked at some
8 percent of in 2009, and steadily decline
afterwards to below 2 percent into the
medium term (Figure 2). Total public debt is
also projected to rise in the short term, as
public enterprises borrow to help finance the
accelerated investment expansion, but total
public debt is projected to peak at close to 53
percent of GDP by 2014 (Table 2).
59.

The government debt-to-GDP ratio

appears broadly robust to a variety of

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 51

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS SOUTH AFRICA

shocks, including weaker GDP growth, a lower
primary balance, a 30 percent real depreciation
of the exchange rate, and a 10 percent
increase in the debt stock (Figure 2). Under
most of these scenarios, the government-debt
ratio rises above the baseline over the
projection period by only modest margins.
One noticeable exception is in the case of the
“no policy change” scenario where the debt
ratio rises sharply and approaches 45 percent
of GDP at the end of projection period, mainly
owing to the recent sharp deterioration in
fiscal balance.

e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with
South Africa
On July 25, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with South Africa.4
Background
Over the last two decades, South Africa has become increasingly integrated into the global
economy, which has allowed output growth to converge to the world average level. But this
integration has also exposed South Africa to global business cycles. Prudent
countercyclical monetary and fiscal policies, together with a flexible exchange rate, have
helped dampen the adverse effects of those global cycles; and sound financial supervision

4

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with

members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of
the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 57

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT SOUTH AFRICA

has guided financial institutions in managing the associated risks. And although transfer
programs have lifted the most vulnerable from extreme poverty, progress in social
indicators has lagged behind macroeconomic achievements.
Over the last year, South Africa’s has continued to recover from the 2008–09 recession led
by solid consumption growth. Although its gross domestic product (GDP) now exceeds the
pre-crisis peak, output remains below potential. Inflation has remained contained, partly
reflecting the negative output gap, rand appreciation, and, until recently, moderate
domestic food prices. The current account has strengthened on account of favorable terms
of trade, which offset a faster recovery in import than in export volumes.
Fiscal and monetary policies have remained supportive. In cyclically adjusted terms, the
deficit swung from a surplus in fiscal year 2007/08 (April-March) to a deficit in 2009/10, and
staff estimates the deficit at some 4 percent in 2010/11. Spending growth moderated in
2010, and became more tilted toward current spending, mainly reflecting above-budgeted
increases in wages. Monetary policy provided additional stimulus, with a 150-basis-point
cut in the policy rate in 2010. These cuts have brought the policy rate to 5.5 percent, its
lowest level in more than 30 years.
With public debt at manageable levels and contained demand pressure, the authorities’
fiscal plans call for fairly gradual fiscal consolidation. This would result in gross national
government debt peaking at around 43 percent of GDP in 2013/14. Although this path
would not pose immediate risks to fiscal sustainability, it could constrain fiscal space to
deal with future shocks. On monetary policy, although further interest rate cuts are no
longer on the horizon and headline inflation has been picking up, the timing for starting the
tightening cycle remains unclear because most of the increase in headline inflation reflects
cost-push factors and uncertainty in the external environment is high.
Having come through the recession in reasonable shape, the financial sector is now
contending with a period of low credit demand and rising costs. Banks have remained well
capitalized and liquid, with well contained market risks. The move toward a “twin peaks”
regulatory and supervisory framework over the next few years, which strives to concentrate

SOUTH AFRICA 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

prudential authority at one peak and market conduct authority at another, bodes well for
further improving the consolidated supervision of financial groups.
The medium-term outlook envisages South Africa growing on par with the world economy.
Growth should rise to 4 percent a year in 2011 and 2012, underpinned by solid domestic
demand. Over the next 12 months, the output gap is set to close and there is a possibility
that headline inflation will breach the top of the target range. The expected recovery in
investment will likely cause the current account deficit to gradually further widen to about
5–6 percent over the medium term.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for the prudent macroeconomic policies
which, together with a flexible exchange rate and sound financial sector, have mitigated the
output drop during the global recession. Directors noted that the key challenges ahead are
to support the ongoing recovery and raise growth to reduce high unemployment and
inequality. In this regard, Directors welcomed the authorities’ New Growth Path which
focuses on these priorities.
Directors supported a broadly neutral fiscal stance for 2011/12 and welcomed the prudent
fiscal policy guidelines included in the 2011 budget. They agreed that, over the medium
term, a tighter fiscal stance than currently contemplated would be useful to rebuild policy
buffers and contain public debt at moderate levels. Directors encouraged the authorities to
rebalance the composition of public spending to help support higher potential growth, and
called for moderation in public wage growth.
Directors endorsed South Africa’s inflation targeting framework, noting that it has kept
inflation expectations well anchored. While recognizing the difficulties in determining the
precise timing for starting the tightening cycle in light of the uncertain global environment,
Directors encouraged the authorities to remain vigilant about the pass through of high
international food and fuel prices. In this context, they noted that a pronounced increase in

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 59

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT SOUTH AFRICA

wages or inflation expectations would call for policy tightening sooner than currently
envisaged.
As a policy response to capital inflows, Directors supported continued exchange rate
flexibility and further accumulation of international reserves, and a gradual recalibration in
the fiscal-monetary policy mix over the medium term. Directors noted that, while capital
flow management measures are an option, their costs and effectiveness should be
carefully considered.
Directors stressed that increased product and labor market flexibility is critical to improve
competitiveness and inequality. They encouraged the authorities to take decisive steps to
improve the wage-bargaining framework to better align wages to productivity levels, and to
contain public sector wage increases to avoid distortions in the private sector wage setting.
They also supported more ambitious efforts to remove barriers to entry in key industries to
facilitate greater product market competition.
Directors noted that the banking system remains sound, with banks being liquid and well
capitalized. Nevertheless, continued vigilance would be important in light of the moderate
impaired advances on bank balance sheets, the banks’ dependence on domestic shortterm wholesale deposits, high household indebtedness, and the renewed tensions in the
international financial markets. Directors agreed that the shift toward a “twin peaks”
regulatory and supervisory framework envisaged over the next few years would further
improve the consolidated supervision of financial groups and lift the status of market
conduct regulation and supervision.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT SOUTH AFRICA

Statement by Mr. Majoro on South Africa
July 25, 2011
The South African economic recovery is progressing well with both monetary and fiscal policies
remaining supportive. The key challenge remains employment creation and this is the main
policy priority going forward. Given limited scope in both fiscal and monetary policy, the focus
is on microeconomic policies and reforms that will stimulate job creation. These include
reforming the product and labor markets with the objective of raising potential growth and
increasing the labor intensity of growth.
Economic Developments and Outlook
The South African economy continues to recover. Following an average growth rate of
2.8 percent in 2010, the economy gained further traction in the first quarter of 2011 with real
GDP expanding at an annualized rate of 4.8 percent. This higher-than-expected growth was
mainly attributable to a rebound in manufacturing output. Notwithstanding this rebound,
aggregate production in manufacturing remained well below pre-crisis levels and capacity
utilization rose only marginally, suggesting room for improvement. Going forward, the
authorities expect GDP to rise by about 3.9 percent in 2011—roughly in line with staff forecast.
Strong increases in real consumption expenditure by the household sector continue to provide
the main impetus to domestic final demand. On the back of rising disposable incomes, declining
household indebtedness ratio and accommodative monetary policy stance, consumption should
continue to be the major driving force in the recovery. Exports and investment continue to
perform below authorities’ expectations, but are expected to accelerate as overall growth in
global activity picks up. The current-account deficit of 3.1 per cent of GDP was recorded in the
first quarter of 2011.
Headline consumer price inflation remained relatively well contained and has averaged
4.3 percent in 2010. The authorities expect inflation to average 5.1 percent in 2011, well within
the inflation target range of 3 to 6 per cent. The main risks to the inflation outlook continue to
emanate from cost push pressures, including administered, food and fuel prices.

SOUTH AFRICA 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Fiscal Policy
Due to a robust fiscal policy framework and sound management of public finances, the South
African economy entered the 2008-2009 recession with healthy public finances and
comparatively low debt levels. This allowed for a flexible counter-cyclical response to
deteriorating economic conditions. Going forward, the authorities will continue to ensure that
fiscal policy remains counter cyclical. The projected budget deficit in 2010/11 is 5.3 per cent of
GDP, but as economic growth strengthens and tax revenue recovers, government will reduce the
budget deficit gradually to 3.8 per cent of GDP by 2013/14. The authorities are comfortable with
the debt-to-GDP ratio of 40 percent or lower given the country’ development needs.
The 2011 Budget underscored that fiscal policy continues to be guided by three principles: a
moderate public debt, counter cyclicality, and inter-temporal fairness. In addition, there are a
number of reforms underway to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of public spending. As
detailed in the staff report, these include increasing the absorption capacity of municipalities and
provinces. In particular, efforts are under way to enhance planning for health, education, and
housing infrastructure, to improve risk and financial management as well as capacity at both
provincial and municipal government levels.
Monetary Policy
Anchored on an inflation targeting framework, monetary policy’s objective remains price
stability. In response to the financial crises the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) reduced the
policy rate by a cumulative 150 basis points during 2010, thereby bringing the nominal and real
policy rates to their lowest levels in over 30 years. At the time of the Article IV consultation, the
authorities discerned no evidence of demand pressures on inflation, given the slow pace of
recovery. However, the average level of wage settlements, which stood at 8.2 per cent in 2010,
is set to continue. These settlements are far above inflation rates and together with rising food
and fuel prices pose an upward risk to the inflation outlook. Given these risks, the MPC will
continue monitoring closely any indications of inflationary pressures, particularly those
emanating from second round effects of food and fuel prices increases. The MPC will not
hesitate to respond timeously to signs that threaten to move inflation out of the target range on a
sustained basis.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 63

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT SOUTH AFRICA

Reforming the product and labor markets
The South African authorities have declared job creation as the top priority for economic policy.
In this regard, the government has launched, in November 2010, the New Growth Path (NGP),
whose core objective is to create five million jobs and reduce the unemployment rate by
10 percentage points in the next decade. Meeting the jobs creation target would require either
higher economic growth or more labor-intensive growth. The authorities agree with staff that
with sustained economic growth of 6 – 7 percent, the target should be achievable even with
current levels of job-intensity. The challenge is to increase growth rate from the expected
4 percent to the required 6 – 7 percent. While the authorities recognize that views differ on the
achievability of these goals, there are, nonetheless, a variety of initiatives currently under way to
increase potential output, which would enable economic growth to increase without undue
impact on inflation.
The NGP calls for wage moderation although details still have to be worked out. Staff has
proposed ways of achieving moderation in wage growth including, through an accord between
government, employers and trade unions to limit real wage increases to 1 to 2 percent for the
next several years and to introduce changes to the sector wide wage bargaining system. The
authorities appreciate these inputs although they recognize that the tendency of bargaining
objectives to prioritize wage increases has complex historical roots and thus would be cautious
in immediately proposing measures that would infringe on labor rights of collective bargaining.
The youth wage subsidy outlined in the 2011 budget should help better align pay and
productivity for new job market entrants. In addition, the budget also provides support for
private initiatives with a strong job-creating component. In the product markets, the competition
commission is aggressively tackling anticompetitive practices in key industries and more still
need to be done. The authorities concur with the staff proposal that a more forceful approach to
strengthen competition in product markets is called for to create new employment opportunities
and increase the purchasing power of earnings. As suggested by staff, the authorities continue to
look for ways to attract new entrants into key network industries like telecoms, rail and road
haulage, and energy generation which could also help improve efficiency and reduce the cost of
production.

SOUTH AFRICA 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Financial Stability
The macro prudential risks in South Africa are moderate, although the financial system
concentration and interconnectedness requires continuous vigilance. In this regard, the
authorities have implemented many FSAP/ROSC recommendations and have started preparing
for the eventual implementation of Basel III. A new risk-based solvency regime for short- and
long-term insurers is being developed by the Financial Services Board (FSB) to enhance the
soundness of the insurance sector. Other regulatory initiatives include regulating systemically
important financial institutions (SIFIs), expanding the scope of financial regulation and
improving the financial crisis resolution framework.
The South African Reserve Bank (SARB) has also enhanced and elevated the Financial Stability
Committee (FSC) and it now consists of all the members of the MPC and other members with
financial stability responsibilities at the SARB.
Additionally, as mentioned in the staff report, over the next few years, the authorities intend to
move toward a “twin peaks” regulatory and supervisory framework, i.e. the concentration of
prudential authority at one peak and market conduct authority at another. All these measures
should enhance the robustness of the South African financial sector going forward. The
authorities recognize that given the uncertainty in global financial developments there is little
room for complacency.
Capital flows
South Africa has been one of the main recipients of portfolio flows over the last year. So far the
authorities have mainly used reserve accumulation to manage these flows and this will continue.
The authorities consider other Capital Flow Management (CFM) measures as potentially useful
tools that are at their disposal, although they currently see no need to utilize them. The
authorities understand that these tools are country specific and thus deciding on their adoption
requires a close look at each country’s economic circumstances. As the staff report pointed out,
curtailing inflows while the country is also relying on them to finance domestic consumption
and investment may not always be appropriate.
The recent exchange rate appreciation in South Africa is partly attributable to capital inflows.
The authorities consider this an essential part of a flexible exchange rate regime which has, so
far, provided a useful shock absorber for South Africa. At the same time the appreciated
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 65

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT SOUTH AFRICA

exchange rate may have negatively affected the country’s competitiveness and thus exports. The
authorities agree with staff that the cost of production is also an important factor influencing
competitiveness. In this regard, the labor and product market reforms, as the staff report pointed
out, should help improve South Africa’s competiveness. The authorities also believe that weak
export performance in South Africa is also attributable to weak export demand by major trading
partners, and as growth picks up in major trading partners, export demand should rise.
A variety of export incentive schemes, such as the Export Marketing & Investment Assistance
Scheme, administered by the Department of Trade and Industry are also in place to improve
export performance. Going forward, the South African authorities will continue looking for
ways to improve export performance, including engaging in efforts to establish a free trade zone
between the East African Community, the Common Market for East and Southern Africa and
the SADC.
