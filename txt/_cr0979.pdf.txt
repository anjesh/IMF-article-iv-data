Executive Summary
Uganda’s economy has been among the fastest-growing in Sub-Saharan Africa. Building
on a foundation of two decades of sound policies, Uganda achieved an impressive economic
performance, with high growth, low inflation, and steady poverty reduction. The PSIsupported program remains on track, all assessment criteria for the fourth review have been
met, and the staff recommends completion of the review.
But in 2008 Uganda has been buffeted by two major shocks. First, the global surge in
food and fuel prices has caused domestic inflation to rise above 15 percent, well beyond
traditional comfort levels. Second, the global economic downturn is likely to affect both the
demand for Uganda’s exports and, more significantly, the availability of financing for critical
investment projects.
Economic growth in 2008/09 is expected to decline, but remain high by global and
regional standards. Staff estimates that growth will fall to 7–7½ percent in the current year,
as activity in the construction and services sectors slows down. In addition, the downside
risks for economic growth are significant. At the same time, core inflation will benefit from
falling international food and fuel prices, reaching an estimated 7 percent by June 2009.
Uganda’s financial system has been relatively insulated from the global financial crisis,
although vulnerabilities exist in some areas. The deteriorating economic environment could
expose weaknesses in banks’ risk management practices, gaps in home-host supervisory
arrangements, operational risks as financial innovation outpaces banks’ systems and controls, and
increasing risk appetite due to intensifying competition from the surge of new banks. Stress tests
suggest that credit risk, rather than direct foreign exposure, represents the main risk for the
banking system.
How should macroeconomic policies react in the short term? For monetary policy, the
crucial challenge will be to sustain confidence in the currency and support the disinflation
process. Meanwhile, fiscal policy should aim at maintaining the orientation of the 2008/09
budget and take a measured response to any cyclical weakening of tax revenues.
The medium-term outlook for Uganda remains favorable, but constraints on growth
are likely to become more binding. Scaling up investment in transport and energy
infrastructure is a critical priority for sustaining and indeed raising Uganda’s medium-term
growth potential. However, the international environment will be more challenging, perhaps
for some years to come, which could affect the financing of investment projects. This places
an additional premium on broadening the domestic revenue base and ensuring value for
money in public spending. Staff’s analysis suggests that Uganda’s exchange rate is broadly in
line with fundamentals.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Over the past two decades, Uganda has experienced one of the most impressive
economic turnarounds in Africa. The amelioration of conflict kick-started rapid economic
growth, which has now been sustained for some 20 years. And the growth momentum has
remained strong, with the real economic growth averaging close to 9 percent over the last
5 years. This growth record has likely been made possible by the reduction of
macroeconomic imbalances and spread of reasonably well-functioning markets to virtually
all parts of the economy. Importantly, growth has contributed to a sharp decline in poverty
from 55 percent of the population in 1992/93 to 31 percent in 2005/06.

This remarkable growth performance, however, has not been accompanied by a
significant structural transformation of the economy. Compared with other countries that
have experienced such long episodes of sustained growth, Uganda remains more reliant on
subsistence agriculture and correspondingly less on high-productivity manufacturing. Staff’s
research in this area1 points to the need for greater infrastructure services, more focused
government intervention, and improved export competitiveness.
3.
The global financial turmoil has hit Uganda as the country was tackling these
medium-term challenges, and has caused a greater-than-usual degree of uncertainty for
policymakers:
•

1

What will happen to private capital inflows? In recent years such flows have been
buoyant, fueling increased consumption and investment. Foreign direct investment

Selassie, Abebe Aemro, Beyond Macroeconomic Stability: The Quest for Industrialization in Uganda, IMF
Working Paper 08/231.

6
has also become increasingly important in financing infrastructure investment,
particularly in the energy sector.
•

Is the impact on Uganda going to be greater because of its open capital account? In
October, the shilling depreciated by 20 percent against the U.S. dollar as capital
inflows waned and non-resident portfolio investors liquidated some of their holdings.2
This was a steeper fall than most other currencies in the region, and the ensuing
volatility has raised the risk premium and complicated investment decisions.

•

Will development partner support be affected? Development partners have so far not
reduced their support. However, since one-third of the budget continues to be
financed by grants or concessional loans, any future change in support would have
important implications for Uganda.

The last Article IV discussions took place in 2006.3 Fund policy advice focused on
upgrading Uganda’s infrastructure, expanding revenue collection and improving expenditure
management, and calibrating the sterilization mix (see Box 1).
Box 1. Key Fund Policy Recommendations and Implementation
In line with advice from the Fund and other development partners, the authorities have
launched an ambitious three-year infrastructure investment program in 2008/09.
The authorities are following the recommendations aimed at strengthening the Uganda
Revenue Authority, although the increases in revenue-to-GDP ratio were revealed to
have been smaller than expected following the recent upward revision to the GDP
series. Progress in expenditure management remains slow, as underbudgeting and
disregard for proper procurement procedures continues to lead to the accumulation of
new domestic arrears.
In the face of strong foreign exchange inflows through September 2008, the authorities
have been reluctant to adjust the sterilization mix in favor of foreign exchange sales
due to concerns about an appreciating exchange rate. They have used foreign exchange
sales when market conditions were favorable.

II. PERFORMANCE UNDER THE PSI
5.
Uganda has had a PSI-supported program since early 2006. The program focuses
on maintaining macroeconomic stability, alleviating infrastructure deficiencies, deepening
the financial sector, and strengthening the business environment. Performance has been
broadly in line with program objectives, and all reviews have been successfully concluded.
6.

All assessment criteria for the fourth review have been met:

•

Fiscal performance at end-June 2008 was in line with the 2007/08 budget and the
program’s objective of gradual fiscal consolidation; the ceiling on net credit to
government by the banking system was observed.

•

Net domestic assets were well below the program ceiling due to larger-thanprogrammed accumulation of net international reserves by the BOU.4 However, the

3

See Uganda—Staff Report for the 2006 Article IV Consultation Country Report No. 07/29, and the Public
Information Notice (PIN/07/8).

4

For program purposes, net domestic assets are defined as base money minus net international reserves.

9
indicative target (ceiling) for base money was exceeded by 6 percent. In recent
months, base money has returned to the program path.
•

The indicative targets on spending under the Poverty Action Fund and on the stock of
domestic budgetary arrears were observed.
III. GLOBAL TURMOIL: THE IMPACT ON THE UGANDAN ECONOMY

The Ugandan economy has been resilient to shocks—growth has been sustained for more
than 20 years against the backdrop of conflict in neighboring countries, sharp swings in the
terms of trade, and unfavorable weather conditions. Would the economy be able to take the
severe shocks of the last several months in its stride too? Overall, staff and the authorities
agreed that the country was well positioned to do so. While growth would almost certainly
slow down, there is no need for exceptional financing. Prudent economic management of
recent years—avoiding a procyclical bias in policies and building up reserves for a rainy
day—should ensure that Uganda weathers this storm successfully.
7.
Even before the recent turmoil in global financial markets, Uganda was affected
by the sharp rise in world food and fuel prices. In particular, core inflation was pushed to
some 15 percent—a level not observed since the mid-1990s. High inflation also contributed
to the sharp real effective appreciation of the shilling observed through September. The
mission’s analysis, presented in the selected issues paper, suggests that the pass-though from
international food and fuel prices accounts for about 5 percentage points of the increase in
the consumer price index.5 This includes both first-round, direct effects as well as the secondround impact on goods and services that are indirectly affected. Increases in world prices for
other commodities may have contributed to high domestic inflation as well. The more recent
decline in international food and commodity prices should nonetheless help reduce core
inflation to around 7 percent by mid-2009.

8.
The deterioration in the global environment is, at a minimum, expected to
moderate growth from its rapid pace of recent years. Staff and the authorities agreed that
the transmission channels would likely include:
•

Private capital inflows—private remittances, foreign direct investment, portfolio
flows, and loans—in the next few years are likely to revert back to pre-2006 levels.
And lower inflows are going to imply lower investment and consumption.

•

Official inflows—expected to remain broadly unchanged in nominal terms in the
short term given multi-year commitment of most donors—would likely decline as a
share of the budget and output over the medium term.

•

There would also likely be lower demand for Uganda’s exports from neighboring
countries and beyond.

•

The heightened economic uncertainty, including on account of the sharp movements
in the exchange rate in October, may also delay investment decisions.

In light of there considerations, staff expects economic growth in 2008/09 to fall to about
7–7½ percent, from an average of 9½ percent during the previous three years. With the
turmoil in global financial markets still ongoing, however, the downside risks around this
baseline scenario are significant.
9.
Uganda’s fiscal and balance of payments positions are also likely to be affected,
albeit to a manageable degree. Revenue collection is likely to be somewhat weaker than
projected in the budget, continuing a trend that started in the first quarter of 2008/09,
although scope remains for further improving tax administration. The impact on the overall
fiscal position is likely to be mitigated, however, by delays in the implementation of the
ambitious infrastructure projects. The external position is also likely to come under pressure,
and export growth is projected to slow down to about 5 percent in 2008/09 as a result of
lower growth in trading partner countries.
10.
The banking sector appears sound overall, although vulnerabilities exist in some
areas. The banks are well-capitalized and there is no indication that they are directly exposed
to the toxic debt that has caused havoc elsewhere. At the same time, the rapid expansion of

12
the banking system and the significant share of foreign exchange-denominated assets and
liabilities on banks’ balance sheets may present risks. In particular, nonperforming loans
have started to increase in nominal terms, although as a result of rapid balance sheet growth
they remain modest as a fraction of total assets. Stress tests suggest that credit risk, rather
than direct foreign exchange exposure, represents the main risk for the banking system.
IV. TACKLING THE CRISIS: POLICIES IN THE SHORT TERM
Given the country’s strong fundamentals, staff called for near-term policies to focus on
minimizing undue volatility in the exchange rate and calibrating a measured response to
cyclical weakening of revenues.
11.
The mission called for monetary policy to sustain confidence in the currency
while supporting disinflation. The mission saw merit in targeted intervention in the foreign
exchange market to stem unwarranted overshooting of the exchange rate. An increase in
regular foreign exchange sales for sterilization purposes would also help to support this
objective. The authorities agreed, noting their long-standing policy of only intervening to
avoid undue volatility in the exchange rate. The BOU had intervened strongly in recent
months, and regular foreign exchange sales for sterilization purposes had also resumed. At
the same time, the authorities underlined the need to safeguard reserves in view of the
changed outlook for capital inflows.
12.
The authorities plan to contain base money growth in 2008/09 well below that in
the previous year. While the planned expansion in development expenditure has the
potential to increase inflationary pressures, staff and the authorities agreed that the proposed
monetary stance should allow twelve-month inflation to decline to 7 percent by June 2009,
helped by falling world market prices. The authorities agreed that it was important to seize
the opportunity to bring inflation back down toward the medium-term objective of 5 percent.

13.
The mission recommended a measured response to cyclical weakening of
revenues. The anticipated slowdown in economic activity raises questions about the
feasibility of the 2008/09 revenue targets. Indeed, according to the preliminary data for the
first quarter of the fiscal year, revenue collection was five percent below target,
notwithstanding higher-than-expected inflation. While the precise magnitude of the cyclical
component in revenue decline is uncertain, staff felt that cuts to the already-tight current
spending levels should be avoided. Besides the risk that further cuts could lead to
accumulation of arrears, staff pointed to indications that the capital budget would be
underspent as another reason to maintain the current spending profile. The authorities
nonetheless felt that the annual nominal revenue target could still be achieved. They noted
that in the event of the revenue shortfall spending cuts would be avoided as much as possible,
and emphasized that ministries and spending agencies were working hard to ensure that the
capital budget would be implemented to the fullest extent possible.6

6

To the extent that the additional funds appropriated for the roads sector in the 2008/09 budget are not utilized
in the current fiscal year, unspent amounts would be ring-fenced and carried over to the next year.

14
14.
Containing financial sector risks calls for continued vigilance. With most banks
foreign-owned, an immediate priority should be to strengthen collaboration and information
exchange between the BOU as host supervisor and the home supervisors of banks operating
in Uganda. In particular, there is a need to agree on contagion crisis arrangements to ensure
that problems in banks’ home countries are not resolved at the expense of the Ugandan
subsidiaries. The BOU should also strengthen its risk analysis. In particular, with foreign
exchange-denominated loans representing about 30 percent of banks’ loan portfolios, it is
important to ensure that they are not exposed to undue risk by strengthening regulations on
foreign currency lending to unhedged borrowers. The authorities welcomed the mission’s
advice and agreed with most of its recommendations.
V. MAINTAINING MOMENTUM: MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK AND CHALLENGES
The authorities are in the process of preparing a new National Development Plan (NDP),
which is expected to sustain the re-orientation of government spending towards improved
infrastructure services—most notably, transport and energy infrastructure as well as water
for agricultural production. At the same time, the weaker external environment may affect
the financing of investment projects, placing additional emphasis on ensuring value for
money in public spending. Staff’s analysis suggests that Uganda’s exchange rate is broadly
in line with fundamentals.
A. Fiscal performance, infrastructure, and the financial sector
15.
Fiscal consolidation has been central to Uganda’s macroeconomic policies in
recent years. The authorities, while not adhering to an explicit anchor, have strived to
gradually reduce the overall deficit (excluding grants) and avoid domestic borrowing. This
was done to reduce donor dependence, encourage private sector development, and ease
appreciation pressures on the shilling.
16.
This consolidation is set to be temporarily reversed as the government scales up
investment to address prominent infrastructure needs (see Box 2). Over the medium
term, development expenditure is projected to expand by nearly four percentage points of
GDP from the level currently budgeted for 2008/09, and total expenditure to taper off at
nearly 22 percent of GDP by 2012/13. Under the authorities’ conservative assumptions about
future foreign assistance flows (significantly below the 8 percent average ratio to GDP
observed over the last five years), this expenditure path could be financed through a
combination of higher tax revenue and domestic borrowing (see text table). Possible delays
in project implementation, however, could result in corresponding postponement of
expenditure.

Fiscal policy could benefit from a strong and transparent medium-term anchor.
In Uganda’s context, the mission argued that the key objective of macroeconomic stability—
providing sufficient room for private sector credit growth and safeguarding debt
sustainability—would be best served by a medium-term deficit or financing target. Sufficient
flexibility should be provided to ensure that high-return public investment does not get
crowded out. At the same time, the recent emphasis on value-for-money needs to be retained,
and indeed strengthened, to ensure that available resources are spent well. This will be
especially important once oil revenues begin to flow. The authorities were in broad
agreement with the mission and expected to consider the issue in the forthcoming NDP.
18.
A drawdown in net international reserves (NIR) could allow the banking system
to provide for the government’s additional financing needs without unduly crowding
out the private sector. With NIR currently covering more than six months of imports and
assuming that the global financial crisis does not have a substantial impact on this stock
beyond the US$117 million drawdown projected for 2008/09, there is space to use some of
these resources to finance Uganda’s infrastructure needs and still maintain reserves in excess
of four months of imports by 2012/13. Private sector credit is expected to grow at a healthy
20 percent per year, well above nominal GDP growth rates, consistent with the authorities’
goal of promoting financial deepening.

16
19.
The authorities remain committed to their target of increasing tax collection by
½ percent of GDP annually. Despite significant efforts, Uganda’s tax collection lags behind
other countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. Raising the revenue effort will require further
improvements in tax administration and the authorities are taking some steps in the short
term (see MEFP, paragraph 7). In the medium term, further measures could include reform of
the Tax Procedure Code, launch of the Medium Taxpayer Office, and strengthening of the
Domestic Tax department of the Uganda Revenue Authority.
Box 2. Infrastructure needs
With the notable exception of the rapidly expanding telecommunication sector, the state
of Uganda’s infrastructure is poor. Road density indicators are at par with the average
for Sub-Saharan Africa, but a much smaller fraction of the roads are paved. The existing
railways are in poor shape and carry a negligible volume of freight. Electricity supply
lags far behind demand, is unreliable (forcing firms and households to invest in
expensive diesel generators), and is available to less than one-tenth of the population.

Domestic expenditure arrears continue to pose challenges. The introduction of the
Integrated Financial Management System (IFMS) neither prevented further accumulation of
domestic arrears—the stock of arrears had grown from 0.5 to 0.7 percent of GDP between
June 2006 and June 2007—nor allowed for timely reporting. The authorities are nevertheless
confident that recent improvements in the IFMS system and the planned roll-out of an
integrated payroll and personnel system (a structural assessment criterion) will reduce the
occurrence of new arrears (see MEFP, paragraph 8). The verification of all arrears for
2007/08 is expected by end-March 2009, and the 2008/09 budget includes an allocation of
one percent of GDP for the clearance of old arrears.
21.
The authorities, jointly with their EAC counterparts, are working on developing
Uganda’s financial sector (MEFP, paragraph 19). The depth and reach of Uganda’s
financial sector remain limited, and its further growth will be instrumental in facilitating
private sector development and poverty alleviation, and in enhancing the authorities’ ability
to rely on open market operations for the conduct of monetary policy.

B. Real exchange rate and competitiveness
22.
In the face of strong foreign exchange inflows, the real exchange rate has
appreciated by some five percent over the past two years. While allowing some exchange
rate flexibility, the authorities regarded part of the inflows as temporary; aiming to avoid
undue appreciation, the BOU accumulated significant foreign exchange reserves during this
period. In this environment, growth of exports has exceeded overall GDP growth in recent
years and the volume growth of major export commodities (except coffee, which has been
affected by the coffee wilt disease) was either in line or above the average volume growth of
world exports. This suggests no obvious competitiveness problem, although export-to-GDP
ratio remains low by regional standards.
23.
Staff’s analysis suggests that Uganda’s exchange rate is broadly in line with
fundamentals. In the medium term, faster productivity growth than in partner countries, and
strong official and private capital inflows, would allow Uganda to sustain significant current
account deficits for some time to come—consistent with an appreciation of the equilibrium
real exchange rate (see Box 3). The risk of lower foreign exchange inflows due to the global
financial crisis, however, limits the scope for appreciation in the short term. Uganda’s open
capital account suggests that it is best-served by allowing exchange rate flexibility to dampen
external shocks while using foreign exchange intervention judiciously to avoid excessive
volatility of the exchange rate.

Box 3. Analysis of real exchange rate fundamentals
Following IMF (2006), three approaches were used to study the evolution of fundamental
factors affecting the real exchange rate in the medium term: equilibrium real exchange rate
(ERER), macroeconomic balance (MB), and external sustainability (ES).
I. Staff estimated the ERER as a function of medium-term fundamentals (terms of trade, trade
volumes, GDP, and aid). The results were inconclusive, pointing to under- or over valuation
of RER depending on the exact specification of the model.
II. In the two-step MB approach, staff first calculated the gap between (i) the current account
balance projected over the medium term at prevailing exchange rates; and (ii) an estimated
equilibrium current account balance (the “norm”), which is a function of macroeconomic
fundamentals (fiscal balance, demographics, oil balance, economic growth). Second, staff
estimated the adjustment in the real exchange rate that is needed to close the gap derived
above.
Results: the current account deficit projected under the constant real exchange rate
assumptions (4 percent of GDP in the medium term) is one percentage point below the
estimated equilibrium current account deficit (5 percent of GDP). Given the estimated
elasticity of changes in balance of payments to changes in real exchange rate, a real exchange
rate appreciation of some 9 percent would be needed in the medium term.
III. The ES approach is based on the idea that the present value of future trade surpluses must
be sufficient to pay for the country’s external liabilities As under the MB approach, staff
calculated the gap between the current account balance projected over the medium term and
the current account “norm.” Under the ES approach, however, the “norm” is defined as the
current account balance that stabilizes Uganda’s external position at some benchmark level.
The results point to real exchange rate appreciation; the exact magnitude depends largely on
the view of what constitutes a sustainable external position. Thus, between 1995 and 2004 (the
latest period for which the data are available), Uganda’s NFA fluctuated between -40 and
-60 percent of GDP (Lane and Milesi Ferretti, 2006). Assuming high GDP growth (8 percent)
and low inflation (5 percent) in the medium term, projected appreciation will be 4 percent, if
NFA is targeted at -40 percent of GDP and 27 percent, if NFA is targeted at -60 percent of
GDP.

C. Other Issues
24.
Regional integration is proceeding and represents an opportunity for sustaining
good economic performance in the region. The economic benefits of a common market in
goods and services are potentially large. Going forward, strong political commitment will
need to be accompanied by intensified technical efforts on the ground, for example in the
elimination of remaining barriers to trade and the harmonization of economic statistics.
Financial integration, and the establishment of a currency union, also have significant
implications for economic policies today. The authorities are working jointly with their EAC
counterparts on the relevant issues (see MEFP, paragraphs 15-17 and 19). A chapter in the
selected issues paper discusses capital market integration in the EAC and the limits to the
conduct of independent monetary and exchange rate policies this will impose on the member
countries.7
25.
Joint analysis with the World Bank suggests that Uganda’s risk of debt distress
remains low. Uganda’s debt ratios have improved substantially over the past few years
(thanks to HIPC and MDRI debt relief) and are projected to remain low over the medium
term and beyond under the baseline scenario.
26.
Progress is being made toward the adoption of a more formal inflation targeting
framework. The new measure of core inflation will be very helpful. Going forward,
developing high frequency economic activity indices and a formal inflation forecasting
model should have priority (see MEFP, paragraph 14).
27.
Oil exploration continues, with small-scale production expected to commence in
2010. Uganda now has confirmed petroleum development potential from a number of
discoveries. The scale of potential recoverable reserves, however, remains uncertain, and no
discovery has yet been declared commercial. Consequently, oil production has not been
incorporated into the macroeconomic framework yet.
VI. PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION AND MONITORING
28.
For monitoring performance under the program, quantitative assessment criteria
for December 2008 and June 2009, quantitative indicative targets for December 2008, March
and June 2009, and June 2010, and structural assessment criterion and benchmark have been
set (MEFP, Tables 1 and 2). The date of implementation for structural assessment criterion
on integrated payroll and pension system has been shifted from January to July 2009 due to
delays in procurement process.

22
VII. STAFF APPRAISAL
29.
Uganda’s economy has been among the fastest-growing in Sub-Saharan Africa.
Building on a foundation of two decades of sound policies, Uganda has achieved an
impressive economic performance, with high growth, low inflation, and steady poverty
reduction.
30.
This remarkable growth performance, however, has not resulted in a significant
structural transformation of the economy. Compared with other countries that have
experienced such long episodes of sustained growth, Uganda remains more reliant on
subsistence agriculture and correspondingly less on high-productivity manufacturing.
31.
In 2008 Uganda has been buffeted by two major shocks. First, the global surge in
food and fuel prices has caused domestic inflation to rise above 15 percent, well beyond
traditional comfort levels. Second, the global economic downturn is likely to affect both the
demand for Uganda’s exports and, more significantly, the availability of financing for critical
investment projects.
32.
Economic growth in 2008/09 will decline, although it will remain high by global
and regional standards. Staff estimates that growth could fall to 7-7½ percent in the current
year, as activity in the construction and services sectors slows down. However, against the
backdrop of heightened global uncertainty, the downside risks to economic growth are
significant. Exchange rate volatility, in part related to Uganda’s open capital account, has
increased sharply in recent months, raising risk premia and complicating the disinflation
process.
33.
Monetary policy should aim at sustaining confidence in the currency while
supporting the disinflation process. While maintaining the primary objective of price
stability, there is merit in targeted intervention in the foreign exchange market to avoid
excessive volatility. Bringing down core inflation will be helped by falling international food
and fuel prices, and monetary policy should seize the opportunity to bring inflation back
down toward its medium-term target of 5 percent.
34.
Fiscal policy should maintain the orientation of the 2008/09 budget and offer
measured response to cyclical weakening of revenues. The anticipated slowdown in
economic activity is likely to make the ambitious revenue target more difficult to achieve.
Nevertheless, immediate cuts in current expenditures should be avoided. Precipitous cuts
would likely exacerbate the problem of domestic arrears; moreover, signs that capital
spending could fall short of target also suggest that further expenditure reductions should not
be rushed.
35.
The banking sector remains sound overall, although vulnerabilities exist in some
areas. The banks are well-capitalized and there is no indication that they are directly exposed
to the toxic debt that has caused havoc elsewhere. At the same time, the rapid expansion of

23
the banking system and the significant share of foreign exchange-denominated assets and
liabilities on banks’ balance sheets may present risks. Stress tests suggest that credit risk,
rather than direct foreign exchange exposure, represents the main risk for the banking
system.
36.
Containing financial sector risks calls for continued vigilance. With most banks
foreign-owned, an immediate priority should be to strengthen collaboration and information
exchange between the BOU as host supervisor and the home supervisors of banks operating
in Uganda. In particular, there is a need to agree on contagion crisis arrangements to ensure
that problems in banks’ home countries are not resolved at the expense of the Ugandan
subsidiaries. The BOU should also strengthen its risk analysis. In particular, with foreign
exchange-denominated loans representing about 30 percent of banks’ loan portfolios, it is
important to ensure that they are not exposed to undue risk should borrowers not be perfectly
hedged.
37.
The medium-term outlook for Uganda remains favorable, but constraints on
growth are likely to become binding. Scaling up investment in transport and energy
infrastructure is a critical priority for sustaining and indeed raising Uganda’s medium-term
growth potential. However, the international environment will be more challenging, perhaps
for some years to come, which could affect the financing of investment projects. This places
an additional premium on broadening the domestic revenue base and ensuring value for
money in public spending.
38.
Uganda’s exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals. Despite some real
appreciation in recent years, export performance has been strong, indicating that Uganda
remains competitive. Analysis of exchange rate fundamentals suggests that, over the medium
term, there is a room for Uganda’s real exchange to appreciate, as productivity growth
outpaces that in partner countries. In the short term, however, Uganda’s open capital account
implies that the economy is best served by allowing exchange rate flexibility to dampen
external shocks while using foreign exchange intervention judiciously to avoid unwarranted
overshooting of the exchange rate.
39.
The PSI-supported program remains on track, all assessment criteria for the
fourth review have been met, and the staff recommends completion of the review.
40.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held in accordance with the
decision on consultation cycles approved on July 15, 2002.

APPENDIX I. LETTER OF INTENT
Kampala, Uganda
December 5, 2008

Mr. Dominique Strauss Kahn
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431

Dear Mr. Strauss Kahn:
On behalf of the Government of Uganda, I would like to inform you of the progress we have
made under our economic program backed by the Fund’s Policy Support Instrument (PSI)
and transmit the attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial policies (MEFP), which
sets out the objectives and policies that the Government intends to pursue in the short and
medium term. The policies outlined in the MEFP are drawn from the Government’s
initiatives to promote employment and rapid economic growth in the context of a stable
macroeconomic environment.
All assessment criteria for the fourth review under the PSI were observed. Reflecting our
economy’s strong fundamentals, the impact of the global financial crisis on Uganda has to
date been limited. In particular, our banking system remains well capitalized, foreign
exchange reserves are in a very healthy position, and providing donor support is disbursed on
time, we expect to implement the fiscal program outlined in the 2008/09 Budget as
envisaged. Nonetheless, as a small and highly open economy, the expected slowdown in
activity in our major trading partners is also likely to lower growth in the current fiscal year
to some extent.
The Government of Uganda believes that the policies set forth in the MEFP are adequate to
achieve the objectives of our PSI-supported program. Given our interest in macroeconomic
stability, we stand ready to take additional measures as may be necessary to achieve needed
objectives. Our PSI proposes assessment criteria for the performance target dates of endDecember 2008 and end-June for the fifth and sixth reviews, which are expected to be
completed by end- May 2009 and end-October 2009. We stand ready to work with the Fund
and other development partners in the implementation of our program and will consult in
advance should revisions be contemplated to the policies contained in the PSI.

34

The Government of Uganda authorizes the publication and distribution of this letter, its
attachments, and all reports prepared by Fund staff regarding the current PSI review and the
Article IV consultation, including the Selected Issues Papers.

Sincerely yours,

/s/
Dr. Ezra Suruma
Minister of Finance, Planning, and Economic Development

35
APPENDIX I—ATTACHMENT I
UGANDA: MEMORANDUM OF ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES
UPDATE
1.
The Government of Uganda remains committed to sustained macroeconomic
stability, economic growth, and poverty reduction. This updated Memorandum of Economic
and Financial Policies (MEFP), summarizes the Government’s strategy to achieve these goals
as set out in the Poverty Eradication Action Plan (PEAP). The Government and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) are cooperating on the economic program through a
three-year Policy Support Instrument (PSI). This MEFP describes performance under the
program through November 2008, specific policies and targets for 2008/09, and mediumterm objectives.
I. Performance Under the PSI
2.
All assessment criteria have been met. Fiscal performance in 2007/08 was in line with
program projections, and, accordingly, the ceiling on net claims on government by the
banking system was observed. The ceiling on net domestic assets of the Bank of Uganda
(BOU) and the floor on the stock of net international reserves of the BOU were also
comfortably observed. Base money exceeded somewhat the allowed 5 percent band with
respect to the indicative target. Indicative targets for poverty-related spending and on the
stock of domestic budgetary arrears were met.
II. Objectives and Policies Looking Forward
3.
The central objective of our economic policies is to maintain the high economic
growth of recent years to achieve rapid and sustained poverty reduction. We are currently
reviewing our growth strategy, as outlined in Uganda’s Poverty Eradication Action Plan, and
are preparing to replace it with a new five-year National Development Plan (NDP). The NDP
sets out an objective of maintaining real GDP growth in the 8-9 percent range, supported by
macroeconomic stability, openness to trade, sound public finances, and addressing key
constraints to private investment. In particular, we plan to significantly increase public
investment in infrastructure (with a particular focus on roads, energy and agriculture) in the
coming years to address one of the principal constraints on growth in Uganda.
4.
Growth in 2008/09 could fall short of the 8 percent mark we have targeted, in the
wake of the global financial crisis. The likely slowdown in our trading partners might reduce
demand for Uganda’s exports and remittances from broad, while pressures in international
financial markets may force the local banks to curtail their lending activities. We are
monitoring the situation closely and intend to use the available monetary and fiscal policy
tools to limit damaging repercussions of the crisis.

36
A. Fiscal Policy
5.
Recent developments affected our budget for 2008/09. Revenue performance has
been below target in the first few months of the fiscal year, but the full-year target should still
be within reach in light of the higher-than-expected inflation and expected improvements in
tax administration. Barring adverse development, we intend to maintain the expenditure
appropriations recently passed by Parliament. In the event that there are delays in
implementation of road projects, the additional allocations earmarked for trunk roads and not
spent in 2008/09 will be carried over to the next fiscal year.
6.
Over the medium term, fiscal policy will be anchored by macroeconomic stability
considerations. Our key objective will be to ensure that public sector does not crowd out
private sector lending and does not endanger debt sustainability. Two other considerations
that will guide our spending profile over the medium term will be (i) implementation and
absorption capacity (particularly once oil revenues begin to accrue to the budget) and
(ii) value-for-money or high rate of return on all areas of government spending.
7.
The policy of annually increasing tax collections by ½ percent of GDP remains in
place, even though improvements in tax administration have been yielding somewhat less
than that in recent years. To ensure that the revenue targets for 2008/09 are met, the Uganda
Revenue Authority will take a number of steps, including speeding-up the collection of
corporate income taxes due, conducting an increased number of audits for businesses with
high import value declarations, and use of new data sources to reduce valuation fraud.
8.
The government remains committed to reducing arrears. New CCS arrears in 2007/08
are estimated at U Sh 43 billion, compared to some U Sh 100 billion in 2006/07. The root
causes of new arrears accumulation remain (i) underbudgeting and (ii) failure by line
ministries and agencies to abide by their budgets. Going forward, as outlined in our Debt
Strategy published in December 2007, we intend to reduce the build up of domestic
expenditure arrears by:
•

ensuring adequate provision of resources for utilities and rent expenditures;

•

enforcing compliance to the commitment control system, by publishing on a quarterly
a list of Votes and Agencies that over commit government without authority; and

•

ensuring that the Accountant General does not recognize expenditure commitments
made outside the IFMS system for both IFMS and non IFMS Votes as arrears and
these commitments therefore not be programmed for payment in future budgets by
the Ministry of Finance.

9.
Relatedly, the Ministry of Public Service will implement the new Integrated
Personnel and Payroll System in three Commissions (Public Service Commission, Health
Service Commission, Education Service Commission), four Ministries (Ministry of Finance,

37
Ministry of Health, Ministry of Public Service, Ministry of Education), and two local
governments (Lira and Jinja Districts) by July 2009. This should improve payroll and
pension records and ensure accurate payroll and pension figures. The implementation
deadline is being extended from January 2009 due to delays in the procurement process.
10.
Oil exploration continues apace with small-scale production expected to commence in
2009/10 for thermal power generation. The timeline for full-scale commercial development
remains unclear, pending completion of exploratory activity. With the view of insuring
prudent and transparent use of Uganda’s oil wealth, our intention is to put oil revenues in a
dedicated oil fund to be managed by the Bank of Uganda. The use of these resources will
then be captured in our Medium-Term Expenditure Framework and will be subject to
existing public financial management regulations, including appropriation by Parliament.
B. Monetary and Financial Sector Policies
11.
We remain committed to keeping annual average underlying inflation at or below five
percent guided by our reserve money target. The significant part of the run-up in prices in
2007/08 can be attributed to higher international food and fuel prices, although domestic
price pressures also played a role. To control the domestic price pressures we will
substantially reduce the growth of base money in 2008/09 (compared with the previous year),
but at the same time loosen the target level somewhat (vis-à-vis the original program target
for 2008/09) reflecting higher-than-expected inflation outturn. The softening of international
prices in the wake of the global financial crisis may help reduce inflation further.
12.
In the context of the global financial crisis, the BOU will rely on an appropriate mix
of foreign exchange sales and domestic securities to sterilize excess liquidity. This will allow
us to reduce exchange rate and interest rate pressures. In view of shallowness of Uganda’s
foreign exchange markets, we will also pay particular attention to preventing undue exchange
rate volatility.
13.
The BoU will carefully monitor developments in the banking system. Uganda’s
financial system has been relatively insulated from the global financial crisis, but the
increasing risk aversion from investors and the spiral effects of a depressed world economy
could present significant challenges. The general sell-off of emerging market currencies
coupled with capital outflows and shallow markets has caused exchange rate volatility. Our
banks have remained sound and stable as improved supervision has helped banks build large
capital cushions and the deposit mobilization by banks have provided a stable source of
funding for banks. The diversified structure of the banks' balance sheets and income sources
should also contribute to banking system resilience. At the same time, there is need for close
monitoring as the deterioration in the external environment could affect the banking system.
To preserve financial stability in the increasingly challenging environment, we will:

38
•

Enhance our communication with the markets on the evolving impact of the global
financial turmoil, in order to forestall panic and herd behavior.

•

Intensify our oversight of bank credit evaluation policies and enforce the regulation
on unhedged foreign currency borrowing.

•

Improve cooperation and exchange of information with the home supervisors of our
foreign owned banks;

•

Seek to establish contingency cross border crisis management arrangements for the
all financial institutions;

•

Advance our efforts in strengthening the supporting financial infrastructure, including
expediting the establishment of the credit registry and further strengthening our
deposit protection fund to align it with international principles;

•

Strengthen capacity for financial risk analysis and reporting, including strengthening
the stress testing framework.

14.
The BOU is preparing for an inflation targeting framework for monetary policy. In
June 2007, UBOS rolled out a new measure of underlying (core) inflation that would more
accurately capture inflationary trends and is expected to roll out a quarterly GDP index by
July 2010. The BOU will also start developing an appropriate communication strategy. In
particular, the BOU will produce a semiannual monetary conditions report that would relate
current economic trends to monetary operations and the inflation target.
15.
Negotiations for the East African Common Market protocol are ongoing. We are
working together with our EAC counterparts to lay groundwork for the establishment of the
EAC Monetary Union. In pursuance of this objective, a two-phased convergence criteria has
been established. In stage 1 (2007–2010), the primary benchmarks include maintenance of an
overall Budget Deficit to GDP Ratio of not more than 6 percent (excluding grants) and of not
more than 3 percent (including grants). In addition, annual average inflation rates should not
exceed 5 percent, while external reserves are expected to cover more than four months of
future imports of goods and non-factor services.
16.
The secondary criteria include achievement of sustainable real GDP growth rate of
not less than 7 percent, a national savings to GDP ratio of not less than 20 percent.
Furthermore, countries are expected ensure that that their ratios of total debt as a percentage
of GDP and the Current Account Deficit as a percentage of GDP are kept at sustainable
levels. In addition, countries are expected to maintain stable and market determined interest
and exchange rates, implement the 25 Core Principles of Bank Supervision and Regulation,
and adherence to the Core Principles for Systematically Important Payment Systems by
modernizing payment and settlement systems.

39
17.
During the second stage (2011-2014) the primary benchmarks become tighter, with
the overall Budget Deficit to GDP Ratio (excluding grants) of not more than 5 percent and of
not more than 2 percent (including grants). In addition, annual average inflation rates should
not exceed 5 percent, while external reserves are expected to cover more than 6 months of
imports of goods and non-factor services.
C. Other Structural Reforms
18.
The government attaches utmost importance to meeting Uganda’s growing demand
for electricity. Financing arrangements for the Bujagali hydropower project have been
finalized and its construction is on track, to be completed by 2011. In the near-term,
government will continue to support the private sector by carrying some of the cost of
temporary electricity generators. The next major sustainable energy project is expected to be
the Karuma hydro electricity generation project—identified as the next least cost alternative
to Bujagali. Barring the appearance of a new project developer, which in the current external
financing environment could well prove difficult, the GOU will be the sole developer of the
project as necessary. Financing for the project would be expected to come from the resources
in the accumulated Energy Fund and borrowing. Relatedly, legislation to govern the use of
the resources in the Energy Fund are expected to be tabled to Parliament in 2009.
19.
The Financial Markets Development Plan (FMDP), which was formulated as a result
of a participatory and consultative strategic planning process, was approved in May 2008 by
the Monetary Affairs Committee (MAC) of the East African Community. The plan reflects
the intention to develop the financial markets in Uganda, and integrate them with the broader
East African Markets with the aim of developing sound and vibrant financial markets, and
supporting efficient mobilization of resources necessary for economic diversification and
sustainable growth. The plan is also intended to lead to the harmonization of the regional
macroeconomic policies and integration of the financial markets.

Net domestic assets (NDA) of the Bank of Uganda (BOU) are defined as the monthly
average (based on daily data) of base money (defined below) less net foreign assets of the
BOU (as defined in para. 2). Based on this definition, the NDA limits will be cumulative
changes from the average of June 2008 to the average of December 2008, and March and
June 2009, and cumulative changes from the average of June 2009 to the average of June
2010.

B. Base Money
3.
Base money is defined as the sum of currency issued by Bank of Uganda (BOU) and
the commercial banks’ deposits in the BOU. The commercial bank deposits include the
statutory required reserves and excess reserves held at the BOU and are net of the deposits of
closed banks at the BOU and Development Finance Funds (DFF) contributed by commercial
banks held at the BOU. The base money limits will be cumulative changes from the daily
average of June 2008 to the daily average of December 2008, and March and June 2009, and
cumulative changes from the daily average of June 2009 to the daily average of June 2010.
C. Net Claims on the Central Government by the Banking System
4.
Net claims on the central government (NCG) by the banking system is defined as the
difference between the outstanding amount of bank credits to the central government and the
central government's deposits with the banking system, excluding deposits in administered
accounts and project accounts with the banking system, including the central bank. Credits
comprise bank loans and advances to the government and holdings of government securities
and promissory notes. Central government’s deposits with the banking system include the
full amount of IMF MDRI. NCG will be calculated based on data from balance sheets of the
monetary authority and commercial banks as per the monetary survey. The quarterly limits
on the change in NCG by the banking system will be cumulative beginning end-June in the
previous fiscal year.

44
D. Net International Reserves of the Bank of Uganda
5.
Net international reserves (NIR) of the BOU are defined for program monitoring
purpose as reserve assets of the BOU net of short-term external liabilities of the BOU.
Reserve assets are defined as external assets readily available to, and controlled by, the BOU
and exclude pledged or otherwise encumbered external assets, including, but not limited to,
assets used as collateral or guarantees for third-party liabilities. Short-term external liabilities
are defined as liabilities to nonresidents, of original maturities less than one year, contracted
by the BOU and include outstanding IMF purchases and loans.
6.
For program-monitoring purposes, reserve assets and short-term liabilities at the end
of each test period will be calculated in U.S. dollars by converting them from their original
currency denomination at program exchange rates (as specified in para. 2).
E. Ceiling on Domestic Budgetary Arrears of the Central Government
7.
The stock of domestic payment arrears under the Commitment Controls System
(CCS) will be monitored on an annual basis. Domestic payments arrears under the CCS are
defined as the sum of all bills that have been received by a central government spending unit
or line ministry delivered prior to the beginning of the current fiscal year, and for which
payment has not been made within 30 days under the recurrent expenditure budget
(excluding court awards) or the development expenditure budget. For the purpose of program
monitoring, the quarterly CCS reports, which will include arrears accumulated at IFMS and
non-IFMS sites, prepared by the Internal Audit and Inspection Office will be used to monitor
arrears. Arrears can be cleared in cash or through debt swaps.
8.
The payments of pre-CCS, non-CCS, and CCS arrears accumulated up to end-June
2004 (“group A arrears”) are covered by specific budget allocations for 2008/09 and
2009/10. The program ceiling on the stock of CCS arrears only covers accumulation of
arrears after end-June 2004 (“group B arrears”). According to the verified report prepared by
the Internal Audit and Inspection Office, this stock of arrears is estimated at U Sh 111 billion
as of June 2007.
F. Expenditures Under The Poverty Action Fund (PAF).
9.
The compliance with the indicative target on minimum expenditures under the PAF
will be verified on the basis of releases (PAF resources made available to spending agencies).
G. Adjusters
10.
The NDA and NIR targets are based on program assumptions regarding budget
support, assistance provided under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative and
the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), and external debt-service payments.

45
. The NCG target, in addition to being based on the aforementioned assumptions, is also
based on assumptions regarding domestic nonbank financing of central government fiscal
operations. In addition, the NDA target depends on the legal reserve requirements on
deposits in commercial banks. Finally, the NDA and NIR targets are based on program
assumptions regarding automatic access by commercial banks to the BOU’s rediscount and
discount window facilities.
11.
The Uganda shilling equivalent of budget support (grants and loans) plus HIPC
Initiative assistance in the form of grants on a cumulative basis from July 1 of the fiscal year
is presented under Schedule A. The ceilings on the cumulative increase in NDA and NCG
will be adjusted downward (upward), and the floor on the cumulative increase in NIR of the
BOU will be adjusted upward (downward) by the amount by which budget support, grants
and loans, plus HIPC Initiative and MDRI assistance, exceeds (falls short of) the projected
amounts.

which debt service due1 plus payments of external debt arrears less deferred payments
(exceptional financing) falls short of (exceeds) the projections presented in Schedule B.
Deferred payments are defined to be (i) all debt service rescheduled under the HIPC
Initiative; and (ii) payments falling due to all non-HIPC Initiative creditors that are not
currently being serviced by the authorities (that is, gross new arrears being incurred).

excess (shortfall) in nonbank financing2 less payment of domestic group A arrears relative to
the programmed cumulative amounts presented in Schedule C. For the purpose of this
adjuster, payment of domestic group A arrears cannot exceed the programmed amount by
more than U Sh 45.0 billion.

14.
The ceiling on NDA of the BOU for end-June will be adjusted upward by the daily
average amount of commercial bank automatic access to the BOU discount window and
rediscounting of government securities by commercial banks.
15.
The ceiling on NDA of the BOU for every test date will be adjusted
downward/upward to reflect decreases/increases in the legal reserve requirements on deposits
in commercial banks. The adjuster will be calculated as the percent change in the reserve
requirement multiplied by the actual amount of required reserves (Uganda shillings and
foreign-currency denominated) at the end of the previous calendar month.
H. External Borrowing Contracted or Guaranteed by the Central Government,
Statutory Bodies, or the Bank of Uganda, and Arrears
16.
The assessment criterion on short-term debt refers to contracting or guaranteeing
external debt with original maturity of one year or less by the government or the Bank of
Uganda. Excluded from this assessment criterion are normal import-related credits. The
definition of “debt” is set out in paragraph 18.

2

Comprising the check float and the change in government securities and government promissory notes held by
the nonbank sector. The change in government securities held by the nonbank sector will be calculated from the
data provided by the Central Depository System (CDS).

47
17.
The program includes a ceiling on new nonconcessional borrowing with maturities
greater than one year contracted or guaranteed by the government, statutory bodies, or the
BOU.3 Nonconcessional borrowing is defined as loans with a grant element of less than
35 percent, calculated using average commercial interest rates references (CIRRs) published
by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). In assessing the
level of concessionality, the 10-year average CIRRs should be used to discount loans with
maturities of at least 15 years, while the 6-month average CIRRs should be used for loans
with shorter maturities. To both the 10-year and 6-month averages, the following margins for
differing payment periods should be added: 0.75 percent for repayment periods of less than
15 years; 1 percent for 15–19 years; 1.15 percent for 20–25 years; and 1.25 percent for
30 years or more. The ceiling on nonconcessional external borrowing or guarantees is to be
observed on a continuous basis. The coverage of borrowing includes financial leases and
other instruments giving rise to external liabilities, contingent or otherwise, on
nonconcessional terms. Excluded from the limits are changes in indebtedness resulting from
refinancing credits and rescheduling operations, and credits extended by the IMF. For the
purposes of the program, arrangements to pay over time obligations arising from judicial
awards to external creditors that have not complied with the HIPC Initiative do not constitute
nonconcessional external borrowing. For the purposes of the program, the Bujagali project is
defined as the hydroelectric dam and related equipment located at the dam site.
18.
The definition of debt, for the purposes of the limit, is set out in point 9 of the
Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to External Debt (Executive Board’s
Decision No. 12274-(00/85), August 24, 2000). It not only applies to the debt as defined in
Point 9 of the Executive Board decision, but also to commitments contracted or guaranteed
for which value has not been received. The definition of debt set forth in No. 9 of the
Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to External Debt in Fund Arrangements
reads as follows:
(a) For the purpose of this guideline, the term "debt" will be understood to
mean a current, i.e., not contingent, liability, created under a contractual
arrangement through the provision of value in the form of assets (including
currency) or services, and which requires the obligor to make one or more
payments in the form of assets (including currency) or services, at some
future point(s) in time; these payments will discharge the principal and/or
interest liabilities incurred under the contract. Debts can take a number of
forms, the primary ones being as follows: (i) loans, i.e., advances of money
to the obligor by the lender made on the basis of an undertaking that the
obligor will repay the funds in the future (including deposits, bonds,
debentures, commercial loans and buyers' credits) and temporary exchanges
3

Contraction is defined as approval by a resolution of Parliament as required in Section 20(3) of the Public
Finance and Accountability Act, 2003

48
of assets that are equivalent to fully collateralized loans under which the
obligor is required to repay the funds, and usually pay interest, by
repurchasing the collateral from the buyer in the future (such as repurchase
agreements and official swap arrangements); (ii) suppliers' credits, i.e.,
contracts where the supplier permits the obligor to defer payments until some
time after the date on which the goods are delivered or services are provided;
and (iii) leases, i.e., arrangements under which property is provided which
the lessee has the right to use for one or more specified period(s) of time that
are usually shorter than the total expected service life of the property, while
the lesser retains the title to the property. For the purpose of the guideline,
the debt is the present value (at the inception of the lease) of all lease
payments expected to be made during the period of the agreement excluding
those payments that cover the operation, repair, or maintenance of the
property. (b) Under the definition of debt set out in point 9(a) above, arrears,
penalties, and judicially awarded damages arising from the failure to make
payment under a contractual obligation that constitutes debt. Failure to make
payment on an obligation that is not considered debt under this definition
(e.g., payment on delivery) will not give rise to debt.
19.
The ceiling on the accumulation of new external payments arrears is zero. This
limit, which is to be observed on a continuous basis, applies to the change in the stock of
overdue payments on debt contracted or guaranteed by the government, the BOU, and
statutory bodies4 from their level at end-June 2006. It comprises those external arrears
reported by the Trade and External Debt Department of the BOU, the Macro Department of
the Ministry of Finance that cannot be rescheduled because they were disbursed after the
Paris Club cutoff date.
I. Monitoring and Reporting Requirements
20.
The authorities will inform the IMF staff in writing at least ten business days
(excluding legal holidays in Uganda or in the United States) prior to making any changes in
economic and financial policies that could affect the outcome of the financial program. Such
policies include but are not limited to customs and tax laws (including tax rates, exemptions,
allowances, and thresholds), wage policy, and financial support to public and private
enterprises. The authorities will similarly inform the IMF staff of any nonconcessional
external debt contracted or guaranteed by the government, the BOU, or any statutory bodies,
and any accumulation of new external payments arrears on the debt contracted or guaranteed
4

This definition is consistent with the coverage of public sector borrowing defined by the Fund (includes the
debt of the general government, monetary authorities, and entities that are public corporations which are subject
to the control by government units, defined as the ability to determine general corporate policy or by at least
50 percent government ownership).

49
by these entities. The authorities will furnish an official communication to the IMF
describing program performance of quantitative and structural assessment criteria and
benchmarks within 8 weeks of a test date. The authorities will on a regular basis submit
information to IMF staff with the frequency and submission time lag as indicated in Table 1.
The information should be mailed electronically to AFRUGA@IMF.ORG .

Safeguards Assessments

Under the Fund's safeguards policy, assessments with respect to the PSI are voluntary. An
update assessment of the Bank of Uganda (BOU) was completed on April 10, 2007 and
concluded that the BOU had strengthened its safeguards framework since the 2003
assessment. The main developments included implementation of International Financial
Reporting Standards, publication of financial statements, establishment of an audit
committee, and strengthening of the internal audit function. Staff made recommendations to
address remaining vulnerabilities in the legal and internal control areas.
X. Exchange Rate Arrangement
The official exchange rate is determined on the interbank market for foreign exchange. As of
October 31, 2008, the official exchange rate was U Sh 1,881 per U.S. dollar. The exchange
system is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current
international transactions. Uganda’s exchange rate regime is classified as managed float
without predetermined path.
XI. Article IV Consultation
The Executive Board concluded the last Article IV consultation on December 15, 2006. The
next Article IV consultation with Uganda will be held on the 24-month cycle, subject to the
provisions of the decision on consultation cycles approved on July 15, 2002.
In February and April 2001, joint World Bank/Fund missions visited Kampala as part of the
Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP). A final report was provided to the authorities
in November 2001, and an MFD mission discussed the report with the authorities during the
Article IV consultation discussion in November 2002, and the Financial System Stability
Assessment was prepared for Board discussion in February 2003. In November 2004, a joint
World Bank/Fund missions visited Kampala for a FSAP update.

6
XII. Policy Support Instrument (PSI)
Uganda initiated a 16-month PSI with the Fund in January 2006. The 16-month PSI was
replaced by a new three-year PSI in December 2006.
XIII. Technical Assistance
Uganda has received extensive technical assistance from the Fund in recent years.4
An FAD mission visited Kampala in April 1998 to advise the authorities on public service
pension reform issues, and another mission visited Kampala in September 1998 to assist the
authorities in improving customs administration procedures. A resident advisor in the area of
local government budgeting began a six-month assignment in August 1998, which was
subsequently extended to October 1999. An FAD resident advisor on budgeting and
commitment control commenced a six-month assignment in November 1998, which was
extended until June 2002. In October 2000, an FAD mission visited Kampala to provide
technical assistance in tax policy and administration. A joint Bank/Fund TA mission visited
Kampala in October 2003 to help harmonize tax investment incentives among the member
countries of the EAC. An FAD TA mission on tax administration also visited Uganda in
October 2004 to develop a comprehensive reform plan for the Uganda Revenue Authority
(URA), followed by visits in April 2005 and April – May 2006. Two FAD resident advisors
(coordinated through AFRITAC-East) assisted the implementation of a CCS at the local
government level and the Fiscal Decentralization Strategy between June 2004 and February
2005. In the upcoming joint FAD-WB mission, the FAD will be represented by AFRITAC
East, which would follow up on the recommendations of the 2005 FAD arrears mission and
check whether the new financial and physical reporting system for local governments has
been implemented.
A STA multisector statistics mission visited Kampala in December 1998 to conduct a
comprehensive assessment of Uganda’s macroeconomic statistics, including data compilation
and dissemination, and to provide recommendations for improvements. Follow-up STA
missions in national accounts and money and banking statistics visited Kampala in March–
April 2000 to examine the status of implementation of the previous recommendations. A
STA mission on government financial statistics (GFS) visited Uganda in December 2001 to
assist authorities in improving fiscal reporting by establishing regular reporting systems that
are aligned with the GFS Manual 2001, as well as ensuring consistency within monetary
sector data for the government. A follow-up mission on GFS visited Uganda in May 2003. A
mission visited Uganda during February–March 2002 to review balance of payment statistics
and the progress in implementing the recommendations of the multisector mission of 1998
4

For a description of technical assistance provided prior to 1998, see the staff report for Uganda’s request for a
three-year arrangement under the PRGF (Country Report 02/213).

7
and of the national accounts mission of 2000 with respect to the measurement of goods
imports. A follow-up mission on balance of payments statistics visited Uganda in August
2003. Uganda is participating in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) and its
metadata were initially posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board in
May 2000. A STA mission was in Uganda during February 2005 to prepare a data ROSC.
Since the 2001 FSAP, MFD’s TA to Uganda has focused on liquidity management, exchange
rate intervention, central bank accounting and auditing, and banking supervision. The
authorities have effectively used TA advice on these topics, and they have made good use of
an MFD resident advisor, who took up her initial appointment in mid-July 2001. The advisor
was fully integrated into the supervision function and has been involved in all aspects of the
work, including participating in on-site examinations; she has subsequently been replaced by
a second resident advisor. MFD has fielded two TA missions (July 2001 and January 2002)
to assist the authorities with liquidity management and address the problems of interest rate
volatility and exchange rate interventions. The BOU has started implementing the
recommendations made in the report, and now clearly separates sterilization operations and
liquidity management; however, they are still having problems with interest rate and
exchange rate volatility and have requested follow-up TA in this area. In March and
September–October 2002, MFD provided TA to improve central bank accounting and the
Bank of Uganda’s accounting manual. A TA evaluation visit was conducted in June 2003,
and an MFD mission following up on monetary and exchange rate operations, public debt,
and liquidity management was conducted in March 2004. An FSAP update mission was
conducted in November 2004 and focused on access, outreach, and stability issues, which
also updated progress made since the last FSAP. A TA mission on enhancing the
effectiveness of monetary policy implementation and developing financial markets was
conducted in August 2005. Finally, a joint MCM/BOU workshop on financial market
development was held in April 2006.
XIV. Future Technical Assistance Priorities
The priorities for Fund technical assistance in the next few years will be in the areas of tax
administration, public expenditure management, especially control and monitoring of public
arrears at both central and local government levels, monetary and exchange rate
management, bank supervision, national accounts statistics, reporting standards for
government finance statistics, monetary and balance of payments statistical reporting, central
bank accounting, and audit and debt management.
XV. Resident Representative
The Fund has maintained a resident representative in Uganda since July 1982.

APPENDIX III. UGANDA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. Uganda
participates in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) and its metadata were initially
posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board in May 2000. Metadata updates
were received in December 2008. Uganda is participating in three modules of the Fund’s
GDDS Project for Anglophone Africa, including: preparation for subscription to the Fund’s
Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS); government finance; and monetary and
financial statistics. The project aims to assist participating countries to implement plans for
improvement identified in their GDDS metadata, and is funded by the U.K. Department for
International Development (DFID).
In February 2005 a STA mission prepared a data ROSC, with results published in July 2006.
The ROSC mission assessed data compilation and dissemination practices against international
standards in national accounts, prices, government finance, and balance of payments statistics;
monetary and financial statistics were not assessed. In April 2007 a Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS) mission assesed dissemination practices vis-à-vis SDDS
requirements for coverage, periodicity and timeliness.
Real sector statistics
Compilers have recently developed estimates of quarterly value added at constant 2002 prices
using the International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC) Rev III groups. However,
methodological shortcomings remain relating to benchmarking and the use of appropriate
indicator series. The Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS) collects output data from a sample
of manufacturing establishments in the industrial belt of the country to compile a Major and a
Main Index of Industrial Production (IIP). Labor market indicators such as employment,
unemployment, and wages/earnings are infrequently compiled and disseminated. UBOS aims
to compile and disseminate labor market indicators on an annual basis, but due to resource and
data unavailability, dissemination occurs with a two year lag. UBOS collects prices of
consumer goods and services from six urban centers for computing inflation rates, which are
disseminated on the last working day of every month. According to UBOS, there are plans to
expand the coverage to include another urban center. UBOS collects producer prices from a
sample of manufacturing establishments to compile the Producer Price Index for
Manufacturing.
Government finance statistics
The Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development (MoFPED) compiles the fiscal
statistics on general government including budgetary central government and local
governments but excluding extra budgetary institutions and the National Social Security Fund.
A revised chart of accounts was implemented for use by all budgetary central government and
local government units from July 1, 2003. Uganda reports Government Finance Statistics
(GFS) data according to the GFSM 2001 framework for the GFS Yearbook, but institutional

11
coverage are limited to budgetary central government and local governments. External debt for
the public sector, external debt guaranteed by the public sector, and debt service schedule data
are disseminated in millions of dollars and in Uganda shillings (using end of year exchange
rates) for the fiscal year (July to June). Uganda does not report any high frequency data for
inclusion in the IFS. In terms of the DFID Phase II project, a GFS mission visited Uganda in
September 2008, to further assist with improving fiscal data.
Monetary and financial statistics
The March 2008 monetary and financial statistics mission found that substantial progress was
made in reporting data to the Fund using standardized report forms (SRF) that align the
monetary data in accordance with the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM).
Beginning in May 2008, the commercial banks have begun reporting their data for monetary
statistics purposes on the new system that provide clear identification of positions with
nonresidents, and breakdowns by domestic sectors and financial instruments. The SRF-based
monetary data will be introduced in International Financial Statistics (IFS) and the IFS
Supplement in January 2009. The data on other depository corporations do not include yet the
positions of credit institutions, and microfinance deposit institutions, which also accept
deposits. No progress has been made yet on savings and credit cooperatives.
External sector statistics
The 2005 data ROSC mission found that the balance of payments statistics broadly follow the
fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5), but that there are some departures
from recommended definitions, scope, and classifications. The mission urged completion of
the conversion to the BPM5 and the development of new source data and estimation
techniques in the following areas: exports of freight and imports of passenger transportation,
compensation of employees, direct investment abroad, portfolio investment and financial
derivatives. International trade data could be improved by incorporation of results from the
Survey of Informal Cross-Border Trade and greater use of trade partner country data sources.
Quarterly and fiscal year data are disseminated in the BOU’s publications Quarterly Economic
Report and Annual Report, as well as the UBOS annual Statistical Abstract. In principle, data
cover the entire economy and include all transactions between residents and nonresidents.
Quarterly balance of payments statistics are disseminated in an analytical format or on the
basis of standard components, in accordance with the requirements of the IMF Balance of
Payments Manual, Fifth Edition (BPM5).
A mission in April 2008 reviewed the private sector financial survey and an informal crossborder trade survey as well as estimation methods for remittances. Proposals were made for
dealing with gaps in recording of transactions in the securities market by nonresidents through
the secondary market and nominee accounts. It also proposed a priority program to cover
developments in the oil industry and identified several alternative methods to improve the
estimation of remittances. The mission also recommended a timely, small-scale quarterly
survey of financial flows.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
UGANDA
Joint IMF/World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis1
Prepared by the Staffs of the International Monetary Fund and
the International Development Association
Approved by Robert Corker and Dominique Desruelle (IMF)
and Sudhir Shetty and Carlos Alberto Braga (IDA)
December 19, 2008
Based on the joint Low-Income Country Debt Sustainability Framework of the World Bank and the
IMF, Uganda is assessed to be at low risk of debt distress. Its debt ratios have improved
substantially over the past few years on account of HIPC and MDRI debt relief. To accelerate and
sustain high economic growth, the authorities plan to continue to address infrastructure
constraints. Under the baseline scenario, external debt is expected to remain well below the
thresholds over the medium and long term, while public debt exhibits stable debt dynamics.
However, a permanent shock to real GDP growth under which growth is on average smaller by
roughly 1 percent of GDP compared to the baseline scenario and where the path of nominal fiscal
expenditure is not adjusted, results in a marked deterioration in public debt. This highlights the
risk should the growth dividend from investments undertaken be lower than expected.
I. Background
1. Uganda has achieved debt sustainability by implementing sound macroeconomic policies
and receiving debt relief. The HIPC and MDRI debt relief improved Uganda’s debt sustainability
outlook substantially by leading to a drastic reduction in Uganda’s debt burden.2 Over this period,
all debt burden indicators declined to levels well below their policy-dependent thresholds.3
External Debt Indicators Before and After MDRI
1

Prepared by the IMF and World Bank staff in consultation with the authorities. This DSA updates the DSA that the
authorities had prepared in September 2008 to reflect the impact of the current financial crisis and the projected global
slowdown. DSA assumptions and results have been discussed thoroughly with the authorities. All debt indicators refer
to Uganda’s fiscal year (July-June).
2
Total MDRI relief (including future interest) delivered in 2005/06 and 2006/07 was about US$3.6 billion.
3
The World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) ranks Uganda as a “strong
performer.” Debt burden thresholds for strong performers are NPV of debt to GDP ratio of 50 percent, NPV of
debt-to-exports ratio of 200 percent, NPV of debt-to-revenue ratio of 300 percent, debt-service-to-exports ratio
of 25 percent, and debt-service-to-revenue ratio of 35 percent.

2. Addressing the infrastructure gap has remained a key element of Uganda’s fiscal strategy
in the near and medium term. Financing for the Bujagali hydroelectric plant, aimed to help ease
power constraints, was secured in December 2007. The US$800 million project was financed by a
private consortium with participation from multilateral lenders, with a public sector guarantee of
only US$115 million (compared to US$400 million non-concessional borrowing envisaged in the
2007 DSA). Starting in 2008/09, the budget allocations to the road sector to finance reconstruction
and maintenance of existing infrastructure almost doubled to 4.5 percent of GDP over three years,
to be financed mainly domestically. The government of Uganda seems set to maintain infrastructure
development (in transportation, electricity, and water) as a priority in the medium term. The
construction of one more hydroelectric plant at Karuma (with about 0.7 percent of GDP per annum
to be provided in the budget) will start in 2009/10. The infrastructure necessary for the development
of the oil sector (such as a small refinery and pipelines) is still at the planning stage.
II. Assumptions
3. On the back of Uganda’s protracted prudent macroeconomic policies and strong growth,
the slowdown in the global economy finds this economy on strong policy footing. Nonetheless,
this small and open economy is not completely shielded from the effects of the crisis. Whereas
growth is not expected to decline dramatically, the balance of payments will probably come under
pressure, with export growth likely to slow down, and private capital inflows—remittances, foreign
direct investment, and portfolio flows—likely to revert back to the pre-2006 levels. The full
magnitude of the shocks on these variables is still uncertain and with the international environment
becoming more challenging, the sensitivity analysis becomes even more important.
4. The fiscal DSA is based on Uganda’s prudent fiscal stance, on improving public
infrastructure over the medium term, and on a gradual tapering off of grant inflows. It is
assumed that grants will continue to decline from 4.5 percent of GDP in FY 2006/07, before
stabilizing at around 3 percent of GDP in the medium term, while domestic revenues are projected
to increase gradually to 15 percent of GDP in 2012/13, in line with the authorities’ policy objective.
Non-interest expenditures will increase smoothly on account of the energy crisis and infrastructure
improvements and will stabilize at 20 percent of GDP, consistent with zero primary balance in the
long run. However, the baseline DSA excludes a number of factors that are difficult to assess and
quantify at this stage, specifically: (i) the investment in infrastructure in the oil sector; (ii) oil
production (expected to commence in 2010), as the commercial viability and the scale of production
is yet to be determined, and (iii) the impact of global economic slowdown on the availability of
external financing for the PPPs. Box 1 summarizes the key assumptions of the baseline DSA.

Updated export data contributed to the lower ratios compared with the 2007 DSA.

3

Box 1. Key Assumptions Underlying the Baseline DSA
Under the baseline scenario, construction of the Bujagali hydroelectric plant which began in 2007/08, will be completed
by 2009/10, reflecting the higher investment in infrastructure and the subsequent increase in production.
Real GDP growth is expected to remain strong despite the impact of the global crisis. After a decline to 7 percent over
the next three years (compared to 9½ percent in 2008/09), growth will increase to 8 percent in 2011/12. Activity will be
boosted by construction activity and revitalization of production in post conflict North and elsewhere due to
improvements in infrastructure.
The growth rate of the GDP deflator is expected to decline from 16.3% in 2008/09 to about 5-6%, as international
prices fall and domestic liquidity growth is contained within appropriate levels.
Exports of goods and services are projected to grow 13 percent on average between 2007/08 and 2027/28, driven largely
by an increase in the export volume of non-traditional exports. This recognizes the fact that exports will slow down
effective 2008/09 on account of an expected decline in demand for Ugandan exports and lower export unit values.
The current account deficit would be above its historical norm by 1½ percentage points on average between 2007/08
and 2012/13 (peaking at 5½ percent of GDP in 2007/08) on account of higher imports related to the construction of the
Bujagali plant, lower global demand for exports, as well as lower private transfer receipts. Ongoing adjustment of the
economy (reflected in a growing share of non-traditional exports) would help the current account deficit stabilize at about
3 percent of GDP in the outer years. Excluding grants, the current account will average 3.2 percent of GDP over the
twenty year period.
Fiscal revenues are assumed to increase gradually from 12½ percent of GDP in 2006/07 to 15 percent of GDP in
2012/13 and 18 percent beyond 2020, as tax administration improves and the share of manufacturing and service sectors
in GDP increases, thereby expanding the tax base. Grants are assumed to decline to 2½ percent of GDP in 2018 and
below 2 percentage points of GDP in outer years.
Non-interest expenditures —including 0.6 percent of GDP over four years for the construction of Karuma hydroelectric
plant and stepped up road investment— are assumed to taper off at 20 percent of GDP, consistent with zero primary
balance in the long term.
Official external loans are projected to increase tri-fold over 20 years from about US$500 million in 2008/09. The DSA
assumes that multilateral creditors will scale up their support, and that IDA will support Uganda with lending operations
throughout the projection period. Under the baseline, multilateral and bilateral official debt would, on average, be
contracted on concessional terms. The US$115 million guarantee for Bujagali is assumed to be called in 2008/09 and paid
for in five annual installments starting in 2009/10.
Compared with the 2007 Joint IMF-World Bank DSA, the current baseline scenario assumes a resilient economy in
the near term and higher real GDP growth in the medium term, in spite of the global economic downturn. In part, this is
on account of the better historical outcomes documented by improved statistics, compared to what was used in the 2007
DSA. At an average growth of 10 percent between 2008 and 2013, export performance is expected to be much lower than
about 17 percent envisaged within the 2007 DSA. Import and export projections in particular are driven by lower demand
and declining commodity prices. This DSA also uses improved statistics on transfers and services, with a better service
balance contributing to slightly improved current account balances for historical years. Overall, the new assumptions
result in a somewhat better current account. The current baseline scenario also includes an upward revision to expected
external loans in line with the authorities’ projections. The fiscal assumptions remain broadly unchanged. The coverage
of the current DSA is more comprehensive, as it incorporates best estimates on the private external debt.

4
III. EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
(a) Baseline scenario
5. External debt is expected to remain sustainable over the next 20 years. (Tables 1a, and 1b,
and Figures 1 and 2).5 All five debt-burden indicators remain well below their policy-dependent
thresholds throughout the period. PV of debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to rise from 14.9 percent in
2006/07 to 17.2 percent in 2009/10, reflecting mainly Bujagali financing as well as higher IDA
loans; by 2027/28, however, this ratio is expected to decline to 12.4 percent. The PV of debt-toexports is expected to increase from 89.6 percent in 2006/07 and peak at 141 percent in 2012/13, as
borrowing increases while export growth decelerates on account of the slowdown in global demand.
The debt service-to-exports ratio is expected to gradually increase between 2007/08 and 2012/13 to
a peak of 14.1 percent (by 2 percentage point higher than in 2006/07), before declining, reflecting
the repayments for Bujagali and the delivery of HIPC and MDRI assistance.
(b) Standardized sensitivity analysis
6. The stress tests point to low risk of debt distress even after taking into account the global
downturn. The standardized sensitivity analysis has been used to inform about the risks to debt
sustainability that may arise, in particular, on account of a deeper global downturn and its impact on
key macroeconomic variables in Uganda such as weaker medium-term export growth, a sharp
depreciation of the Shilling, and lower concessionality of new external borrowing. 6 Under all
standardized stress tests, the debt-to-GDP, debt-to-exports, and debt service-to-exports indicators of
public and publicly guaranteed external debt remain below their threshold values throughout the
next 20 years.
7. However, a large macroeconomic shock could worsen Uganda’s PV of debt-to exports ratio
significantly, a risk heightened by the sharp revisions in the global outlook. Lower export
growth (export value growth at historical average minus one standard deviation in 2008/092009/10) would raise Uganda’s PV of debt-to-exports ratio to a peak of 130 percent of GDP in
2012/13. A combined shock (by one-half standard deviation) to real GDP growth, exports, GDP
deflator, and non-debt creating flows over the period 2008/09-2009/10 would increase Uganda’s
PV-to-GDP ratio to a peak of 22 percent in 2011/12 and its PV-to-revenue ratio to 156 percent in
2009/10. The global slowdown has only increased the downside risk of such shocks, which would
have a significant impact on debt sustainability by putting the Ugandan economy at a high
5

Improved national statistics have resulted in an upward revision of the GDP and the current account balance that
contributed to better debt sustainability indicators.

6

While the baseline already incorporates lower forecasts, the downside risks are significant, as the impact of the
financial crisis on global demand is still unfolding. Uganda’s export opportunities could be reduced to the extent
contagion across countries and sectors is worse than under the baseline. In the event that foreign investors unwind their
position in Uganda, more costly access to private capital and downward pressure on the exchange rate would have an
adverse effect on debt ratios.

5
indebtedness level for a prolonged period. Uganda’s debt service ratios would nonetheless remain
well below the policy-dependent thresholds. Historical scenarios also point to the risks associated
with Uganda’s uneven performances over the last ten years, with respect to GDP and export growth,
inflation, transfers, and FDI inflows. Yet, stronger and more steady outcomes since 2001 would
indicate an increased resilience that could help mitigate these risks. Moreover, Uganda’s large
foreign reserves accumulated in recent years would provide a significant cushion in the event of
higher foreign-financing needs.
8. Overall, Uganda’s public and publicly guaranteed external debt will remain sustainable in
case of shocks (Figure 1). Even under the extreme stress test, the PV of public external debt will
not exceed 30 percent of GDP over the projection period. Similarly, the stress tests do not indicate
any debt-servicing problem. However, the historical scenario points to the risks associated with
lower performances, as indicators would continue to deteriorate during the entire projection period.
IV. FISCAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
9. Indicators of total public debt, which include external debt and domestic public debt, are
favorable (Tables 2a, 2b, and Figure 2). Under the baseline, the PV of public debt will worsen, but
stabilize at 21 percent of GDP. The debt-service-to revenue ratio will also stabilize in the medium
term. However, indicators would deteriorate markedly if growth were to be reduced for a long time,
without any adjustment in the nominal primary expenditure path. As suggested by the sensitivity
analysis, if growth were to turn out lower than the baseline by roughly1 percentage point, the debt
to GDP, debt-to-revenue and debt-service to revenue ratios would all display an increasing trend
even in the long run. The lack of adjustment in the nominal expenditure path in this context, leads
to a primary deficit that is, on average, higher than in the baseline by 2.2 percentage points of GDP
over the period 2009-2028. This demonstrates the importance of investment selection to ensure
value for money and the adjustment in expenditure growth rates in the event of a permanent shock
to GDP growth. Structural policies to ensure a favorable investment climate for the private sector
will also be crucial.
V. CONCLUSION
10. The DSA analysis shows that Uganda’s public debt remains sustainable under
the baseline scenario. Uganda’s public debt has been reduced significantly as a result of the
MDRI, and with a prudent borrowing strategy and the continuation of the stability-oriented
fiscal policy, debt should remain comfortably low during the projection period. While Uganda still
disposes of additional fiscal space to finance a higher investment program, cautious borrowing and
reliance on concessional financing remain a critical element of the debt management strategy.
Furthermore, to minimize the risk of lower growth dividend from public investment, careful
investment selection to ensure value for money and appropriate structural policies to sustain private
investment will be essential.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and r = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.

Public Information Notice (PIN) No. 09/23
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
February 17, 2009

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with
Uganda
On January, 7, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Uganda.22
Background
Uganda’s economy has been among the fastest-growing in Sub-Saharan Africa. Building on
a foundation of two decades of sound policies, Uganda achieved an impressive economic
performance, with high growth, low inflation, and steady poverty reduction.
In 2008, Uganda has been buffeted by two major shocks. First, the global surge in food and
fuel prices has caused domestic inflation to rise above 15 percent, well beyond traditional
comfort levels. Second, the global economic downturn is likely to affect both the demand for
Uganda’s exports and, more significantly, the availability of financing for critical investment
projects. As a result, economic growth in 2008/09 is expected to decline from the high levels
reached in recent years, but remain robust at 7–7½ percent by global and regional
standards. At the same time, core inflation will benefit from the drop in international food
and fuel prices, falling to an estimated 7 percent by June 2009. Monetary policy is expected
to support the disinflation process, with base money growing at a substantially lower pace
than in 2007/08.

22

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of
the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
The economic slowdown poses some risks for public finances, and the fiscal deficit is
projected to widen somewhat in 2008/09, as development expenditures are scaled up to
address infrastructure needs, but recourse to domestic financing is expected to remain
limited to less than 1 percent of GDP. Moreover, buoyant private capital inflows, which
allowed international reserves to accumulate at a brisk pace in 2007/08, have abated and
reserves are expected to drop moderately as demand for Ugandan exports falls and other
inflows, including remittances and foreign direct investment, are scaled back. Uganda’s
financial system has been relatively insulated from the global financial crisis, but the economic
slowdown could expose weaknesses in banks’ credit portfolios.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors commended the authorities for their sound macroeconomic management that has
contributed to an impressive economic performance and steady poverty reduction. The
current global economic downturn and reduced prospects for external financing pose
immediate challenges to the Ugandan economy. Directors considered the economy to be
well-positioned to face these challenges given its low public debt, comfortable level of
international reserves, and relatively sound banking sector. Nevertheless, this difficult
external environment calls for heightened vigilance.
While the medium-term outlook remains favorable, Directors agreed with the authorities that
infrastructure bottlenecks and dependence on subsistence agriculture represent important
impediments to growth. Thus, they welcomed the preparation of a new National
Development Plan, which entails, among other things, a scaling-up of government
investment in infrastructure. In this connection, they stressed the need for careful evaluation
of investment projects, including their impact on debt sustainability and on international
reserves.
Directors recognized the strong fiscal performance in 2007/08, and agreed that fiscal policy
should maintain the modest stimulus underlying the 2008/09 budget. In the event of a
revenue shortfall for 2008/09, they encouraged the authorities to avoid precipitous cuts in
current expenditures, strengthen expenditure management, and prevent further
accumulation of domestic arrears. For the medium term, Directors supported the authorities’
target to increase tax revenues by ½ percent of GDP annually and welcomed their
consideration of introducing a fiscal rule, which would underpin fiscal consolidation and
prudent use of oil revenues.
Directors stressed that monetary policy should aim at sustaining confidence in the currency,
while supporting the disinflation process. They encouraged the authorities to seize the
opportunity provided by falling international food and fuel prices to bring inflation back
toward its medium-term objective. Directors underscored the importance of ensuring that

3
the necessary pre-conditions are in place before introducing a formal inflation-targeting
framework.
Directors considered that Uganda’s flexible exchange rate regime has served the country
well, facilitating adjustment to external shocks. They took note of the staff’s assessment that
the real effective exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals, consistent with strong
export performance over the past few years. Directors also saw scope for targeted
intervention in the foreign exchange market to avoid excessive volatility.
Directors noted that Uganda’s banking sector remains sound overall, with banks being wellcapitalized and relatively insulated from the global financial crisis. They noted, however, the
recent rapid expansion of bank lending and the significant share of foreign-exchange loans
in banks’ portfolios. To address these vulnerabilities, Directors saw the need to further
strengthen prudential supervision as well as close collaboration with the home supervisors
of banks operating in Uganda.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

IMF Executive Board Completes Fourth Review Under the Policy Support Instrument
for Uganda
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has completed the fourth review under a
three-year Policy Support Instrument (PSI) for Uganda. The PSI was approved on December 15, 2006
(see Press Release No. 06/281). The program goals include macroeconomic stability, sustainable
economic growth, poverty reduction, financial sector deepening, and improved public sector financial
management.
The IMF's framework for PSIs is designed for low-income countries that may not need IMF financial
assistance, but still seek close cooperation with the IMF in preparation and endorsement of their policy
frameworks. PSI-supported programs are based on country-owned poverty reduction strategies adopted
in a participatory process involving civil society and development partners. This is intended to ensure
that PSI-supported programs are consistent with a comprehensive framework for macroeconomic,
structural and social policies to foster growth and reduce poverty. Members' performance under a PSI is
reviewed semi-annually, irrespective of the status of the program (see Public Information Notice No.
05/145).
Following the Executive Board's discussion, Mr. Takatoshi Kato, Deputy Managing Director and Acting
Chair, stated:
“Uganda’s economy has continued to thrive. Sound macroeconomic policies underpin Uganda’s good
performance. Nevertheless, the current global financial crisis and economic downturn pose downside
risks to Uganda’s growth prospects and the authorities will need to be vigilant.
“The authorities are committed to maintaining price stability. The recent fall in international food and
fuel prices provides an opportunity to return inflation to its medium-term objective.
“The fiscal stance underlying the 2008/09 budget provides an appropriate modest stimulus. In the event
of revenue shortfalls from budget targets, immediate cuts in current expenditures should be avoided as

2

these may exacerbate the economic downturn and lead to domestic arrears.
“Investing in infrastructure remains a critical priority for raising Uganda’s medium-term growth
potential. The current global environment could make raising foreign financing more challenging,
placing a premium on careful project evaluation to ensure that public investment remains cost effective
and consistent with long-term debt sustainability.
“Uganda’s banking sector remains generally sound. However, vulnerabilities exist in some areas,
reflecting the rapid expansion in bank lending and the significant share of foreign-exchange loans in
banks’ portfolios. Prudential supervision needs to remain vigilant to address potential risks,” Mr. Kato
said.

Statement by Samuel P. Itam, Executive Director for Uganda
January 7, 2009
Introduction
1. My Ugandan authorities thank the staff for the candid and constructive policy dialogue during
the mission for the Article IV consultation and the fourth review under the Policy Support
Instrument (PSI). The authorities remain committed to maintaining macroeconomic and financial
stability, sustaining high and broad-based growth, and reducing poverty significantly. They agree
with the broad thrust of the staff report and request Directors’ support for the completion of the
fourth review. All assessment criteria for the period were met. Also, all but one of the indicative
targets were met; base money exceeded marginally the allowed 5 percent band.
Recent economic developments
2. The Ugandan economy continues to record buoyant performance because of disciplined
macroeconomic policy implementation, and strong effort in carrying out structural reforms. Real
GDP growth was broad-based, propelled by services and manufacturing. During 2008/09,
however, Uganda has been buffeted by two shocks: the recent high, albeit subsiding, fuel and
food prices; and the global economic and financial crisis. The shocks have triggered a rise in
annual inflation from low single digits in the first half of 2007/08 to about 14 percent in
November 2008. Further, real GDP growth is estimated to slow from 8.9 percent in 2007/08 to
7.4 percent in 2008/09 due to the adverse impact from the shocks.
3. Balance of payments performance and capital inflows have been strong, resulting in some
appreciation pressures on the Uganda shilling against the US dollar in 2007/08. The shilling,
however, experienced sharp depreciation pressures in October 2008 mainly because of the recent
dollar appreciation against major currencies. In addition, the downside risks posed by the global
financial crisis have resulted in investors in treasury bills and government bonds not rolling over
these instruments on maturity, with the associated capital outflows. Gross international reserves
remain at comfortable levels, being equivalent to about 6 months of imports at end-October 2008.
All told, the real effective exchange rate appreciation has been modest. However, if the
appreciation persists, it may, with a lag, hurt export competitiveness.
4. The macroeconomic performance and the outlook for the remainder of 2008/09 is in line with
the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP). The authorities recognize and
remain committed to resolving a number of challenges to sustain the high growth performance.
These challenges include scaling up resources to finance infrastructure, especially roads and
energy; transforming the agricultural sector; strengthening the IFMS to ensure prudent budgeting,
execution and monitoring; and putting in place mechanisms for appropriate management of oil
revenues expected to come on stream in 2010.
Objectives and policies going forward
5. The authorities are replacing the Poverty Eradication Action Plan (PEAP) with a new five-year
National Development Plan (NDP). The NDP aims at real GDP growth of about 8 percent per

2

annum over the medium term, supported by macroeconomic stability, open trade, sound public
finances, and measures to address key constraints to private investment. In this regard, Uganda’s
recent sovereign credit rating that improved from a single B to a B+ is expected to boost
confidence in the economy. Furthermore, the authorities plan to raise substantially public
investment in infrastructure – roads, energy and railways – for the next three years to address one
of the principal constraints on growth in Uganda. Understandably, the authorities are monitoring
the economic situation closely in the wake of the global economic and financial crisis, and will
use the available monetary and fiscal policy tools to limit damaging effects on the economy.
Fiscal policy
6. Regarding the budget for 2008/09, revenue has been somewhat lower in the first few months of
the year but is projected to reach the target, as further improvements in tax administration take
hold. Also, spending is expected to be as budgeted. However, should development spending be
lower than projected, due to delays in implementation of road projects, unspent funds will be
carried over to the next fiscal year. Going forward, the authorities will consider introducing a
fiscal rule to tamper strong spending pressures, particularly when oil revenues begin to flow
in 2010. For a transparent and prudent use of Uganda’s oil wealth, a specific line on oil will be
introduced in the National Accounts and incorporated into the Medium Term Fiscal Framework
(MTFF). Furthermore, the authorities are committed to working on the three main areas where
cash management could be improved and the build up of domestic expenditure arrears avoided:
(i) cash flow forecasting;
Monetary and exchange rate policies, and financial sector reform
7. Uganda remains committed to keeping the average underlying annual inflation around
5 percent, guided by the reserve money target. The significant part of the run-up in prices in
2007/08 can be attributed to increases in international food and fuel prices. Monetary policy tools
will continue to be used to anchor inflation and its expectation by, inter alia, reducing the growth
of base money. The subsiding of international commodity prices in the wake of the global
financial crisis may help reduce inflation further. In the context of the global financial crisis,
reliance will be on an appropriate mix of sterilization instruments to manage liquidity, using a
combination of domestic Open Market Operations and foreign exchange sales.
8. The Bank of Uganda (BOU) is preparing for an inflation-targeting framework for monetary
policy. The Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS) rolled out a new measure of underlying (core)
inflation that would more accurately capture inflation trends and is expected to roll out a quarterly
GDP series by end 2008. The BOU is in the process of designing appropriate monetary and
exchange rate policy communication strategies. In this regard, the BOU will produce a
semiannual monetary conditions report that would relate current economic and financial market
trends to the real economy, growth in monetary aggregates and implementation of monetary
operations, and the inflation target.

9. The exchange rate remains market-determined. However, interventions in the foreign exchange
market will continue to deal with speculations that may cause damaging exchange rate
movements. In view of the shallowness of Uganda’s foreign exchange market, the authorities will
also pay particular attention to other contributing factors in the effort to prevent undue exchange
rate volatility.
10. Uganda’s financial system has been relatively insulated from the global financial crisis, but
the increasing risk aversion from investors and the spiral effects of a depressed world economy
could present significant challenges. The banks have remained sound and stable as improved
supervision has helped them build large capital cushions, while deposit mobilization has provided
a stable source of funding. The diversified structure of the banks' balance sheets and income
sources should also contribute to resilience in the banking system. Nevertheless, the BOU will
carefully monitor developments in the banking system, particularly in light of the deterioration in
the external environment.
Other structural reform
11. The government attaches utmost importance to meeting Uganda’s growing demand for
electricity. Financing arrangements for the Bujagali hydropower project have been completed and
its construction is on track for commission by 2011. In the near-term, the government will
continue to support the private sector by carrying some of the cost of temporary electricity
generators.
12. To facilitate private sector’s access to financing, Uganda is implementing a financial market
development strategy in coordination with the other Central Banks of EAC partner states. Under
the auspices of the EAC, the Monetary Affairs Committee (MAC) is stepping up its technical,
policy and institutional preparedness for eventual EAC monetary union.
