BELGIUM
Staff Report for the 2005 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by Staff Representatives for the 2005 Consultation with Belgium
Approved by Poul Thomsen and Michael Hadjimichael
January 19, 2006

Belgium’s economy has been performing reasonably well, and its economic policies are
appropriately guided by the need to deal with population aging. The good economic
performance is based on high productivity, supported by credible fiscal policies and a generally
stable financial system, as documented in the Financial System Stability Assessment (FSSA)
accompanying this report. Recognizing that higher growth is essential to attenuate the
consequences of aging, structural reforms are being implemented, and social partners and the
authorities have adopted a Generation Pact to boost job creation. Fiscal policy aims to support
growth through tax cuts while gradually building up fiscal surpluses to fund the rising costs of aging
in part through a reduction in the interest bill.
Policies will need to be strengthened to succeed:
•

The near-term economic outlook is favorable, but domestic wage developments pose a
risk to competitiveness in the medium term, and demographics will dampen trend
growth. There is consensus on the need for structural reforms to boost productivity and for
further wage moderation, though social partners have not yet agreed on how to achieve
the latter.

•

Balanced budgets during the past five years have contributed to appreciable fiscal
consolidation. However, reconciling ongoing growth-enhancing tax cuts with budget
surplus goals will require explicit spending restraint as well as structural reforms that rely
less on budgetary resources. Reaching the consolidation objectives also requires further
strengthening of fiscal institutions and clarification of the responsibilities of the various
levels of government.

•

To boost employment rates in the labor market, it will be essential to complement the
reforms initiated with the Generation Pact. Most importantly, the wage-bargaining
framework should be focused more on achieving higher employment rates.

•

To preserve the stability and resilience of the financial system, it will be important to
meet the challenges posed by the move to Basel II, the increasing complexity of financial
groups, and European integration; upgrade insurance and pension fund supervision to the
same high quality as banking supervision; and continue to ensure adequate oversight and
prudential supervision of the globally important payment and securities settlement system.

I. ECONOMIC BACKGROUND AND OUTLOOK1
1.
Growth has been slightly better than in the euro area (Figure 1 and Table 1).
In 2004, encouraged by low interest rates and permanent tax cuts, households reduced their
savings rate and invested in housing. Enterprises stepped up capital formation, reflecting
rising profits, the low cost of funding, and a catch-up from earlier depressed levels. While
these developments boosted imports, the increase in oil prices choked consumption in
late 2004 and, together with a sudden decline in external demand, caused near stagnation of
economic activity in early 2005 (Text Table 1). Since then, private consumption and exports
have been gaining strength while investment remained resilient, prompting a modest
acceleration in growth.

2.
As elsewhere, oil price hikes have boosted headline inflation. Harmonized consumer
price inflation peaked at 3 percent in September 2005 but fell back as oil prices decreased
somewhat and temporary tax rebates on heating oil took effect. Excess headline inflation
over the euro area average can be attributed to transitory factors (Figure 2). Underlying
inflation has been hovering at about 1.4 percent, reflecting limited pricing power due to
intense international competition and economic slack. Private sector hourly wages are
estimated to have risen by about 2.3 percent in 2005, while unit labor costs grew by
2.1 percent.
3.
Policy conditions have been supportive of activity (Figure 3). Low interest rates
have been sustaining domestic demand while the return of the euro to a more depreciated

level helped rekindle exports. The procyclicality implied by the pursuit of balanced budgets
has been limited through the use of one-off measures, which allowed masked operation of
automatic stabilizers. Even so, with the economy very open and mainly producing for the
euro area, fiscal multipliers have been small, and monetary conditions appropriate for the
area as a whole have been fine for Belgium as well. Conversely, membership of the monetary
union has imparted discipline on domestic policies, with the authorities underscoring that
their forward-looking approach had been important to preserve confidence.
4.
The economic recovery is expected to strengthen. The staff projects GDP growth to
increase from 1.5 percent in 2005 to about 2.1 percent in 2006, marginally (0.1 percentage
point) less than assumed in the 2006 budget. Demand from key trading partners has been
edging up, and global growth is projected to remain robust in 2006. Domestically, income tax
cuts will compensate for the loss of purchasing power from higher oil prices and, based on
approved building permits, residential construction should remain resilient. Nonetheless,
household spending will soften somewhat, with the savings rate expected to stop falling. The
expansion of fixed investment is expected to moderate, given its exceptional strength
in 2005. Harmonized consumer price inflation is projected to average 2.4 percent in 2006.
5.
Foreign demand and global imbalances pose external risks, while wage growth and
developments in residential property prices constitute domestic sources of uncertainty.
A faltering of growth in Europe and a disorderly euro appreciation would dampen growth. If
the 2005–06 wage agreement is implemented as envisaged, domestic wage increases will
exceed those of key trading partners. While this might support demand in the short run, it
would adversely impact competitiveness in the medium run. Risks connected to the buoyant
housing market seem confined. The recent rise in residential real estate prices is the
combined result of low interest rates, the investment in housing of capital repatriated in the
context of the 2004 fiscal amnesty, the introduction of frontloading of the tax deductibility of
interest payments, and more aggressive mortgage lending by banks (Box 1 and Selected
Issues Chapter I). While further increases in interest rates would dampen house price growth,
several factors imply that such an event would impact the economy only gradually and
mainly through residential construction. Household mortgage debt and bank exposure to
mortgages is relatively low, and there has been no notable evidence of equity withdrawal and
thus no direct support from housing wealth for consumption.
6.
More fundamental are the interrelated challenges of population aging and
increasing international competition. Aging will adversely impact the budget directly, but
also indirectly through its negative affect on potential growth, which is already being
hampered by low employment rates. Increased scope for outsourcing should support growth,
though only if labor and product markets are sufficiently flexible to respond. In international
comparison, Belgium’s relative strengths are its high level of labor productivity, recent per
capita GDP growth, and progress in product market deregulation (Figure). Labor market
indicators signal an area of comparative weakness, however. Public debt has been declining
at a steady pace, strengthening debt sustainability, but the level of public debt remains high
and vulnerable to growth shocks (Figure 4 and Table 2).

-5-

Box 1. Buoyant Housing Market: How Large a Risk?
Residential real estate prices have been increasing strongly in Belgium, with some of the pickup prompted
by fiscal measures. Year-on-year increases have nonetheless been less than in some of the neighboring
countries, such as the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. In contrast to other countries, where there have
been recent cycles, Belgian housing prices have been rising continuously during the last 20 years. In real
terms, they increased by 44 percent since the previous peak and 86 percent since the previous trough. In 2004,
when Belgium introduced a tax amnesty, there was an acceleration as, reportedly, investment in secondary
homes was a popular outlet for repatriated capital. Further, the new fiscal regime for mortgage loans
permitting frontloading of the fiscal advantage, may have induced households that previously could not afford
a home to enter the market. In addition, reductions in transactions costs and the newly-introduced ability to
carry over taxes from the purchases of the first home to the next in the Flanders region may have bolstered
demand.
If interest rates increased, residential construction could experience a significant slowdown, but risks to
the economy are confined since households’ and banks’ exposure to real estate is not high. The main
driver of housing prices in Belgium has been the unusually low interest rate environment. Rising interest
rates are likely to slow house price growth or trigger a brief reversal in real terms. However, risks to the
economy are limited. Mortgage debt to GDP in Belgium is 47 percent, higher than in France (26 percent),
but well below the United Kingdom (75 percent) and the United States (69 percent). Mortgage loans
constitute only about 10 percent of banks’ assets, lower than in neighboring countries. Further, even though
variable rate mortgage contracts increased considerably in recent years, caps on these contracts will limit
the impact on disposable income when rates rise. In addition, there is little evidence of equity withdrawal.
Consequently, a slowdown in the housing market will have little direct impact on consumption, but
residential construction, which is sensitive to house prices and makes up roughly 5 percent of GDP, would
slow down, dampening overall growth.

7.
Even though the regular pension system has been reformed, the remaining
incremental cost of aging could push public debt onto an unsustainable path.2 Assuming
that employment rates can reach Lisbon targets, the authorities project aging to add
3.6 percentage points of GDP to budgetary outlays by 2030. With public debt still at
95 percent of GDP, deficits of such magnitude would become unfinanceable. Options for
further reform of the pay-as-you-go component of the regular pension system are limited, as
replacement rates are already among the lowest in the EU and further projected to decline
since pensions are indexed to prices only. Thus the authorities’ strategy to address the budget
impact of aging relies on a further reduction in debt and use of the savings from the interest
bill to cover most of the cost of aging.
8.
Demographics will reduce trend growth. The dependency ratio is already rising, but
the labor force is projected to increase as well for the next five years, thus supporting growth.
Thereafter, under unchanged policies, demographics would lower annual potential growth by
almost 1 percentage point. However, the employment rate could rise faster than its
progression as the result of the demographic increase in female participation. Indeed, the
overall employment rate (15–64 years) in Belgium was about 60 percent in 2003, almost
7 percentage points less than the (unweighted) average of its three key trading partners. High
labor costs, a high tax wedge on labor, open-ended unemployment benefits, and ubiquitous
early retirement schemes seem to be the underlying causes (Figure 5). Regional differences
in unemployment rates point to skill mismatches and lack of mobility.
9.
Challenged by globalization, the wage bargaining framework faces difficulties in
preserving competitiveness.3 Designed to maintain competitiveness vis-à-vis a tradeweighted average of France, Germany, and the Netherlands, as enshrined in the 1996
competitiveness law, the framework has nonetheless allowed wages to outpace this average
since 2001 (Text Table 2), while productivity growth has broadly kept pace. So far, the
resulting erosion of competitiveness has been limited, as evidenced by continuing large trade
and current account surpluses and the behavior of export market shares (Figure). For
2005–06, because of partial indexation to higher-than-expected inflation and lower-thanexpected wage increases in Germany and the Netherlands, competitiveness is set to erode
more substantially.4 Conversely, globalization could positively affect productivity through

II. POLICY ISSUES
10.
Policy discussions focused on how to achieve the necessary fiscal consolidation,
promote higher potential growth, and uphold the good track record of financial stability.
There was broad agreement on the authorities’ policy objectives and the direction of reforms,
but the staff saw a need to broaden reforms, enhance their effectiveness, and ensure that
reform measures do not jeopardize the required buildup of fiscal surpluses (Section A). The
authorities concurred with the findings of the FSSA—which accompanies this report and is
discussed separately in Section B below. They intend to implement most of its
recommendations, in line with their receptivity to past Fund advice (Box 2).
11.
The authorities’ strategy is to deal with population aging through further up-front
fiscal adjustment, a durable balancing of the social security accounts, and structural
reforms to promote higher trend growth. This overall approach enjoys broad consensus,
including among social partners, though views differ on the specifics required to achieve
these goals. Given decentralized policy-making, regions and communities will need to
contribute to overall consolidation and structural reforms, while agreements between labor
unions and employers are necessary for efficient social security and labor market reforms. To
help sustain reform efforts, the authorities favor a strengthening of cooperation on structural
policy changes at the EU level.

Box 2. Effectiveness of the Policy Dialogue
The authorities and staff generally agree on economic policy objectives and directions. The
authorities see the scope and speed of reform constrained by the long-standing tradition of building
consensus among social partners and the country’s federal structure and the sensitive interregional
relations. They also attach high value to social peace and the preservation of confidence.
Consequently, implementation of Fund recommendations has been slow-paced and remains
incomplete.
Fiscal policy
Fund recommendations: reduce primary spending growth durably in order to achieve the
authorities’ twin objectives of further fiscal consolidation and a reduction of the tax burden; adopt a
multi-year expenditure-based framework to lock in structural fiscal adjustment and achieve
budgetary surpluses to prepare for population aging.
Policy developments: fiscal consolidation has been impressive with the budget in balance
since 2000 and public debt steadily falling as a share of GDP. The primary surplus declined
recently as interest savings were used for tax cuts and spending increases. The authorities continue
to focus on achieving annual nominal balance targets.
Labor and product market reforms
Fund recommendations: reform labor market institutions to boost low labor utilization; specifically,
phase out early retirement arrangements, modify the wage-bargaining framework to ensure that cuts
in social security contributions lead to lower labor costs, curb the duration of unemployment
benefits, and enforce job search requirements; in product markets, continue deregulation and
liberalization.
Policy developments: labor market reforms have relied mostly on active labor market programs,
including cuts in the labor tax wedge, but recently, employment services have been strengthened
and a Generation Pact adopted with specific measures to raise employment of the young and old.
Product market reforms are complying with timelines set by the EU, while the administrative and
regulatory burden on enterprises is being reduced considerably and the competition authority
strengthened.
Financial sector
Fund recommendations: Continue to adapt supervisory arrangements to changing market
developments, enhance macro-prudential supervision and cooperation between the central bank and
supervisors, upgrade insurance supervision, and strengthen pension supervision earnestly.
Policy developments: banking and insurance supervisors have been merged, the central bank has
begun publishing financial stability reviews, and a Financial Stability Committee has been set up
including representatives from supervisors. An FSAP is being completed with this consultation.

- 11 -

12.
In the staff’s view, the authorities’ policies, while guided by a coherent set of
medium-term objectives, are not sufficient to jointly achieve the envisaged fiscal
consolidation and increase in trend growth. Fiscal consolidation necessitates public
expenditure restraint and would benefit from higher growth, while higher growth, especially
in the context of heightened global competitive pressure, requires more flexible labor
markets, including a lower labor tax wedge, and more competitive product markets. The
authorities’ actions focus foremost on cuts in taxes and social security contributions and
other budgetary measures to promote job creation and growth, supported by some structural
reforms, though without tackling key labor market rigidities. As an alternative, the staff
proposes to reduce these rigidities more directly. Simulations with the Fund’s Global
Economic Model indicate that comprehensive labor market reforms, which do not rely on
up-front tax cuts, could raise GDP by about 6 percent in the long run.6 Further reforms in
product and services markets combined could yield a similar increase. In such a scenario, the
tax wedge on labor can fall appreciably without requiring additional expenditure restraint and
without jeopardizing fiscal sustainability.
A. Achieving Sustainable Public Finances and Higher Growth
Fiscal consolidation
13.
The authorities’ objective is to shift the budget gradually into surplus. For 2006, the
budget is targeted to be again in balance (Figure 6 and Tables 3 and 4). The authorities feel
very strongly that achieving announced nominal targets has been essential to establish and
maintain the credibility of their fiscal strategy, even if recourse to one-off measures has been
necessary to cope with cyclical effects. They observe that recourse to such measures has been
declining since 2003, implying an improvement in the underlying position. For 2007, a small
surplus (0.3 percent of GDP) is envisaged. Thereafter, the surplus would be built up
gradually by 0.2 percent of GDP per year until it reaches 1.5 percent of GDP. This surplus is
expected to be maintained through around 2020, after which it will be allowed to decline to
fund the incremental costs of aging. Technically, this assures fiscal sustainability
(i.e., a stable debt-to-GDP ratio in 2030 at about 25 percent), provided the employment rate
rises by several percentage points as envisaged under the Lisbon strategy.
14.
The staff noted that medium-term fiscal surplus objectives had been allowed to slip
from earlier ambitions. Up to 2003, stability program updates aimed for a surplus of
½ percent of GDP by 2005, and a further buildup of about 0.3 percentage point of GDP per
year thereafter. Based on a comprehensive analysis of the aging problem, the High Finance
Council (HFC) had set a budget surplus target of 1.5 percent of GDP by 2011, which the staff
found appropriate. The current stability program update envisages a slower buildup of the
6

See Chapter II of the Selected Issues Paper: “Macroeconomic Impact of Labor and Product Market Reforms.”

- 12 -

surplus, while subsequent preliminary estimates of the EU’s aging working group show a
slight increase in Belgium’s cost of aging. The HFC, which experienced a lapse in its
functioning last year, was unable to publish its 2005 medium-term assessment of public
finances and compliance with the internal stability pact, even though its technical work
continued.
15.
Divergent revenue performance and spending pressures among the different
entities of government pose a potential obstacle to overall fiscal consolidation.
Decentralization was designed to leave the central government in charge of public debt and
social security and of executing the strategy of funding the rising costs of aging from the
declining interest bill. Subsequent policies have eroded the revenue base and increased
spending pressures for the central government and done the opposite for the regions, at least
ex ante. Thus, in 2005, to reach overall budget objectives, the central government had to
obtain a commitment from the regions to temporarily save some of their revenues. In
addition, while budgets of the autonomous regions and communities are jointly expected to
be in balance in the medium term, there are underlying divergences between regions. The
region with systematic surpluses may not continue to run surpluses as it has no compelling
reason to do so.
16.
The authorities are taking steps to set the social security system on a sound
financial footing. With pensions and social assistance indexed only to prices, there is a
concern that some groups of society will fall into poverty traps. Hence, consistent with the
assumptions underlying the long-term aging projections, the budget provides 0.06 percent of
GDP per year for real increases in such benefits. The contribution base to fund social security
is being broadened beyond labor and will include some indirect taxes and 15 percent of the
taxation of savings income.
17.
At the same time, health care spending growth is expected to be curbed.
Expenditure on health care is being allowed to increase by 4.5 percent per year in real terms
through 2007 in order to catch up with modern technology and changing needs. Thereafter,
the authorities plan to reduce it to 3.1 percent per year, in line with long-term aging
projections. Structural measures are being taken, including benchmarking to best practices,
increasing copayments, and promotion of the use of a referring doctor. If approved health
spending growth exceeds the increase in revenue from social security contributions, other
sources of revenue will be tapped to avoid increases in the labor tax wedge.
18.
While budget objectives and tax reduction programs have been set in a mediumterm context, the staff noted that overall fiscal policy implementation lacked such an
orientation:
•

The pursuit of nominal annual budget targets has led to continuing reliance on one-off
measures, which is even being slightly stepped up in the 2006 budget. Consequently,
while at the current cyclical juncture a balanced budget would imply an appreciable
structural surplus, it does not do so once adjusted for one-off measures. More
importantly, most of these one-offs (e.g., the takeover of pension fund assets of public

- 13 -

enterprises, sale and lease-back arrangements for real estate, tax securitization
operations, and compression of public investment) imply future outlays and do not
constitute gains in net present value terms.
•

Medium-term programs to reduce taxes and social security contributions are not
being matched with similar medium-term plans to curb expenditure or raise revenues.
The absence of such a framework masks, for example, that achieving surplus targets
beyond 2006 without one-off measures would require discretionary spending to fall
by ¾ percent per year in real terms (Table 4). In addition, cuts in social security
contributions have been used to help reach wage agreements among social partners.
Consequently, (i) tax reductions have absorbed a considerable amount of interest
savings, thus eroding the primary surplus; and (ii) ad hoc increases in taxes have been
increasing uncertainty about the tax system.

19.
To compensate for ongoing tax reduction, balancing the budget in 2006 requires
tight spending restraint and additional new tax measures. Broad-based spending restraint
and slower public investment are expected to limit spending growth at the federal level
(excluding pensions) to 0.3 percent in real terms. However, the final stage of the
2001 income tax reform and ongoing reductions in social security contributions will lower
revenues by about 0.8 percentage point of GDP. Hence, tax increases yielding 0.5 percentage
point of GDP are being implemented. About half of this will come from taxes levied on
certain types of life insurance policies and mutual funds invested in government securities,
hitherto exempt. A securitization of VAT tax arrears and an income tax regularization will
provide the other half.7 Concurrently, the tax administration and sanctions for tax evasion are
being strengthened. Any windfall revenues from higher-than-projected growth will be saved.
20.
Achieving a balanced budget in 2006 is not yet in hand. While the staff is confident
that further measures will be taken as needed to reach budget balance in 2006, its projections
indicate that under current policies, a deficit of 0.4 percent of GDP remains to be filled (Text
Table 3). Very tight spending guidelines remain to be backed by specific actions. If these
measures are not structural, the underlying balance will deteriorate by more than ½ of one
percentage point of GDP in 2006.

7

Outstanding VAT arrears will be sold as a bond, in a similar manner as happened in 2005 with income tax
arrears.

Jobs and economic growth
21.
Social partners and the authorities have agreed on a “Generation Pact” to boost
employment of the young, low-skilled, and older workers. The Pact, whose implementation
starts in 2006, includes: (i) additional cuts in employers’ social security contributions
targeted at young and older workers and shift and night work for up to about 0.4 percentage
point of GDP; (ii) reform of early retirement regimes, inter alia by raising the eligibility age
from 58 to 60 years and the minimum career length to 35 years; (iii) tightening job search
requirements for older workers; (iv) strengthening training; and (v) a better accompaniment
of laid-off workers, including bonuses for a rapid return to work. People working beyond
age 60 will see their pensions topped up. The public sector will help lower youth
unemployment by allowing more of its vacancies to be filled with first-time jobs.
22.
Taxes on labor are being reduced, and awareness is being built that wage
moderation will be essential to preserve competitiveness. During 2002–10, the tax burden on
labor is expected to be lowered by the equivalent of nearly 3 percentage points of GDP. With
limited budgetary room, revenue is being raised from other sources. To ensure an effective
decline in labor costs and import the wage moderation ongoing in trading partners, further
tax cuts are to be made contingent on equivalent wage moderation. The staff and authorities
agreed that the current level of competitiveness was adequate but should not be allowed to
deteriorate. Social partners have been asked to discuss ways to claw back some of the
expected competitiveness losses as a result of the implementation of the 2005–06 wage
agreement. Labor unions agree with the need for structural reforms to boost competitiveness

- 15 -

but anticipate difficulties in convincing their membership to moderate wage demands so soon
after reforms of the early retirement regime, unless additional job creation can be guaranteed.
23.
The staff emphasized that the

bargaining framework, if targeted (Text
Table 4). Even if gross wages could be kept unchanged, the steady state budgetary cost
would still be at least 1 percent of GDP. SSC cuts implemented so far, mostly on the
employer side, and those envisaged in the Generation Pact total about 2 percent of GDP and
can be expected to raise employment by 1½ percentage points in steady state. Personal
income tax cuts will reach 1 percent of GDP with the last stage of the reform in 2006,
without significant effects on employment. Alternatives within the budget, such as financing
SSC cuts from other revenue sources or through spending restraint have limitations. With
targeted cuts to raise the employment rate by 5 percentage points, the latter would imply a
real decrease of discretionary spending (outlays excluding social security spending) by
2½ percent per year over 2007–10.
24.
The current wage-setting framework impedes the beneficial effects of reform on job
creation and the ability of the economy to respond to pressures from outsourcing. As the
unemployed and persons outside the labor force have little voice in discussions between
social partners, cuts in the tax wedge on labor are mostly being used for higher take-home
pay.8 With wage increases in trading partners expected to remain low owing to competitive
pressures and structural reforms and indexation placing a floor under domestic wage
increases, the wage-bargaining framework does not allow a swift correction of erosion in
8

This is inherent in the framework, which computes the ex ante room for wage increases after taking into
account changes in employers’ social security contributions as discussed in “Employment Effects of Reductions
in Labor Taxes in a Wage Bargaining Model,” IMF Country Report 05/76.

- 16 -

competitiveness. In addition, tying wage increases to those of key trading partners that have
lower labor costs and significantly higher employment rates on average is not conducive to
catching up with the latter.
25.
The business environment is being made more attractive. To promote investment, a
notional interest rate deduction has been introduced for equity capital, equalizing its fiscal
treatment with that of debt financing. Administrative simplification has yielded considerable
results: the authorities estimate that the associated costs of doing business in Belgium have
declined from 3.4 percent of GDP in 2002 to 2.6 percent of GDP in 2004. The backlog of
adopting EU directives has been eliminated, and liberalization of network industries, in
particular electricity and postal services, is continuing. The competition authority has been
strengthened, while public spending is being reallocated to foster a knowledge-based society
and encourage research and development. On overall product market regulation, Belgium is
ahead of its neighbors (Figure 5) and at the EU average following recent progress (¶6). As
noted by the OECD, a further reduction in state control and barriers to entrepreneurship
would be desirable.
Discussion
26.
The authorities and social partners acknowledged the need for further reform while
preserving the main features of Belgium’s social model. They emphasized that the
Generation Pact constituted a milestone, with its focus on the need to work longer, improve
job search assistance, and tighten enforcement of job search requirements to address the
consequences of aging. They felt that the existing wage-bargaining model could be refocused
on job creation by explicitly taking into account developments in the employment rate in
setting the room for wage increases. More widespread use of “all-in” agreements, which set
nominal wage growth regardless of subsequent inflation, would be considered, but not before
the 2007–08 wage round. On fiscal issues, the authorities emphasized that they would take
further measures to balance the 2006 budget. To reach surplus targets in 2007 and beyond,
they believed that sufficient spending restraint could be achieved and saw further scope to
broaden nonlabor taxation. They agreed that the HFC should continue to play its key role as
independent assessor of public finance developments.
B. Financial Sector Issues and Financial System Stability Assessment
27.
Building on the economic recovery in 2004 and the low-risk environment, the
performance of the financial sector has been improving. Overall vulnerability declined as
financial soundness indicators and bank profitability picked up (Figure 7 and Tables 5 and 6).
The increase in bank profits stemmed mainly from rising noninterest income and lower
provisioning, while interest income was squeezed by stiffer competition for savings deposits
and mortgage loans. With deleveraging by enterprises, mortgage lending and expansion
abroad became the key drivers of bank activity, though recently, domestic corporate
borrowing has perked up. Banks reported that their preparation for Basel II was on track.
Both nonlife and life insurance posted higher profits, the former because of premium growth
and the latter largely due to a rise in investment income (Table 7). However, in the current

- 17 -

low interest rate environment, relatively high guaranteed rate of return contracts continue to
curb the life sector’s profitability.
28.
With increasing cross-border activity and complexity of bank-insurance
conglomerates, the institutional structure governing supervision has been modified. In
early 2004, the banking and insurance supervisors were merged into a single institution
(CBFA). The NBB has stepped up macroprudential supervision and regularly publishes
Financial Stability Reviews. A Financial Stability Committee has been established consisting
of the combined boards of the CBFA and the NBB to ensure seamless coordination and focus
on issues of systemic importance. To further combat money laundering, bearer instruments
are being phased out, thus bringing Belgium’s AML/CFT framework in line with
international guidelines.
29.
The FSAP found the financial system generally sound but facing pressures to find
new sources of income growth. There has never been a systemic financial crisis in Belgium,
and stress tests conducted in the context of the FSAP confirm the system’s resilience. Its
stability is anchored in some Belgium-specific features. The system benefits from a steady
source of funding in the form of savings deposits, partly supported by tax incentives and to a
large extent invested in government securities. Banks hold little equity and continue to be
cautious toward risks, while banking supervision is of very high quality. Going forward,
rising interest rates may slow mortgage lending activity while the increase in lending to
enterprises is likely to continue, leading to a rebound of provisioning from current,
historically low levels.
30.
The authorities were in broad agreement with the FSAP recommendations. They
have already begun upgrading the supervision of insurance and pension funds and are
working on enhancing oversight and supervision of the globally important payment and
securities settlement system located in Belgium, while strengthening coordination between
the NBB and CBFA in this area. In the life insurance sector, the authorities recognize the risk
of guaranteeing returns for the duration of the contract and the need for more adjustable rates
of return. The politically sensitive link between the minimum guaranteed interest rate on
funded pensions and the maximum rate on life insurance products hampers progress in this
area. The authorities are also adjusting the internal structure of the CBFA to enhance its
effectiveness in supervising the bank-insurance conglomerates.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
31.
The economy has been performing reasonably well, and economic policies are
guided by a coherent set of medium-term objectives to deal with population aging, but
policies need to be strengthened to achieve these goals. Recognizing that higher trend
growth will be necessary, measures to boost employment rates have been reinforced, while
economic deregulation and administrative simplification are continuing to improve economic
efficiency. To jointly achieve the envisaged budget surpluses and higher labor utilization,
medium-term spending restraint will be required, and labor market reforms should directly
address rigidities, while relying less on budgetary resources to promote job creation. An in-

- 18 -

depth analysis of the financial system found the sector sound and stable, with a need to bring
supervision of insurance and pension sectors at par with the high quality achieved for
banking supervision.
32.
Recent economic performance and the near-term outlook are favorable, though
they will continue to depend on external demand and domestic wage developments. The
medium-term orientation of policies has supported household and business confidence. With
demand in trading partners recovering, achieving growth of somewhat more than 2 percent
in 2006 appears realistic. The prevailing level of competitiveness seems adequate, but
domestic wage increases are set to exceed those of key trading partners, posing a downside
risk to exports and investment in the medium term. Rising interest rates would dampen
housing price growth, but the impact on the economy will be gradual and limited as housing
wealth does not directly affect consumption.
33.
The emphasis of fiscal policy on reducing public debt and supporting growth needs
to be complemented with medium-term spending restraint. The authorities’ track record of
meeting announced budget targets is commendable, though reliance on one-off measures
should be replaced with specific plans to curb expenditure, as is being done in the case of
health care. This will be essential in 2006 to avoid a deterioration in the structural fiscal
balance. To help achieve surpluses beyond 2006 as intended, budget management should be
complemented by a medium-term spending framework, or at a minimum shift to primary
balance targets to ensure that the declining interest bill contributes to consolidation. The
intention to save revenue windfalls is welcome. The planned decline in the tax wedge on
labor and on equity financing will help create jobs and foster investment. However, a more
comprehensive approach to tax reform should be instated to provide stability, and recourse to
securitization of tax arrears and tax amnesties should be abandoned.
34.
Fiscal institutions will need strengthening to ensure that medium-term fiscal
consolidation objectives are adhered to. While the balanced budget objective for 2006 is
appropriate and within reach with few additional measures, the path toward fiscal surpluses
should be brought in line with the recommendations of the HFC, and adjusted as estimates of
aging costs are updated. It will be essential for the HFC to resume its traditional role in
providing recommendations on the fiscal outlook and assessing developments in public
finance and adherence to the internal stability pact, which should be continued to ensure that
policies at various levels of government are consistent with overall consolidation objectives.
35.
Further structural reforms are necessary to improve labor utilization and foster
higher trend growth. With employment rates low by international comparison, the focus
should be on reforming labor market institutions. In this context, the Generation Pact is a
welcome step as its increased emphasis on job search assistance and requirements together
with targeted cuts in social security contributions will boost job creation, especially for the
young and low-skilled. To support its effectiveness, the duration of unemployment benefits
should be limited in time. The Generation Pact’s measures regarding early retirement
regimes and employability of older workers will need to be taken further to meaningfully
boost employment of older workers. The wage-bargaining framework needs to be geared

- 19 -

more toward job creation, by explicitly taking into account progress in raising the
employment rate in setting wage increases. Social partners should agree on wage moderation
to prevent an erosion of competitiveness, reductions in taxes and social security contributions
should not be used to boost take home pay, and indexation should be abandoned.
Commendable progress in reducing the administrative and regulatory burden needs to
continue and be extended to economic deregulation and product market liberalization.
36.
A thorough assessment of the financial sector under the Fund’s FSAP program
found the sector to be stable and resilient and recommends further strengthening of
supervision: (i) the upgrading of banking supervision needs to continue to meet the
challenges posed by the move to Basel II and keep pace with the increasing complexity of
financial groups and regulations against the backdrop of European integration; (ii) insurance
and pension supervision should be strengthened, and developments in the insurance sector
need to be monitored closely in the context of a low interest rate environment; (iii) an
effective mechanism needs to be established to deal with the consolidated supervision of the
bank-insurance conglomerates; (iv) adequate capacity should be devoted to the oversight and
prudential supervision of the payments and securities settlement systems while ensuring
seamless coordination among the entities involved; and (v) progress in shaping the Banking,
Finance, and Insurance Commission supported by the NBB’s macroprudential analysis
should continue to preserve the record of financial stability.
37.
It is proposed that the next Article IV Consultation take place on the standard
12-month cycle.

Figures in the boxes represent average projections for the respective variables in the baseline and scenario being
presented. Ten-year historical average for the variable is also shown.
2/ Permanent 1/4 standard deviation shocks applied to real interest rate, growth rate, and primary balance.
3/ One-time real depreciation of 30 percent and 10 percent of GDP shock to contingent liabilities occur in
2006, with real depreciation defined as nominal depreciation (measured by percentage fall in dollar value of
local currency) minus domestic inflation (based on GDP deflator).

1/ Covers general government. Gross debt is used.
2/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + αε(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; α = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and ε = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as αε(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

APPENDIX II

BELGIUM: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Belgium’s economic and financial statistics are adequate for surveillance purposes. The
National Bank of Belgium (NBB) regularly publishes a full range of economic and financial
data and provides calendar dates of main statistical releases. On-line access to these
comprehensive databases is facilitated by the NBB’s data search engine, Belgostat. Belgium
is a SDDS subscriber. Statistics for International Financial Statistics on banking institutions
and monetary aggregates are prepared on a monthly basis and are timely.
Belgium adopted the European System of Integrated Economic Accounts 1995 (ESA95)
in 1999. Revisions of national accounts started in November 2005 to comply with
EUROSTAT requirements and prepare for the adoption of chain-linked national accounts
statistics. Unlike in other countries, the NBB is responsible for compiling national accounts
statistics. Quarterly accounts are published within a lag of three months. Both annual and
quarterly accounts data are of good quality, with shortcomings mainly related to export and
import deflators, which are based on unit values rather than prices collected directly from
exporters and importers.
General government revenue, expenditure, and balance on an accrual basis (ESA95) are
published annually. The NBB publishes monthly data on central government operations. It
would be helpful to present these data quarterly on a national accounts basis to facilitate
monitoring of public finances.
The recent FSAP found that overall quality and availability of financial indicators were good
and suggested that additional indicators for the insurance sector be developed. The
authorities are providing quarterly updates of financial sector indicators (FSIs) in a timely
manner.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation with
Belgium
On February 27, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Belgium.1
Background
Following weakness in early 2005, mainly reflecting a negative contribution from the external
sector and weak household consumption due to high energy prices, growth has picked up.
Exports revived as external demand strengthened. Household confidence improved, rekindling
consumption. Enterprises stepped up capital formation in response to rising profits and the low
cost of funding. Boosted by oil price increases, inflation peaked in September 2005 while wages
rose faster than in key trading partners, supported by widespread, if partial indexation. Low
interest rates and the depreciation of the euro from earlier peaks supported demand. In spite of
a balanced budget rule, the procyclicality of fiscal policy has been limited by the use of one-off
measures.
The authorities and the staff project GDP growth to strengthen into 2006 to somewhat more
than 2 percent, as demand from trading partners increases further. Private consumption is
projected to pick up in response to tax cuts, and residential construction is likely to remain
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2resilient, even though house price growth is likely to slow. Bank exposure to mortgages, use of
variable interest rate mortgage loans, and household debt are low by international comparison,
and there is no evidence of equity withdrawals. Business fixed investment is expected to
moderate, after exceptional buoyancy in 2005. Domestic wage increases will continue to
outpace those of key trading partners if the 2005–06 wage agreement is implemented as
envisaged. While this would support consumption in the short run, it could adversely affect
competitiveness and thus dampen exports and investment in the medium run.
As elsewhere, the economy is facing pressures from population aging on the budget and
growth. Potential growth and future costs of aging are in line with the EU15 average, while labor
productivity is slightly above it. However, the employment rate is very low in comparison and the
tax wedge on labor very high. The government’s strategy to deal with aging consists of fiscal
consolidation and measures to raise labor utilization. With the budget in balance since 2000,
public debt has fallen sharply as a share of GDP, creating room to fund the rising costs of aging
through interest savings. However, these savings have recently been applied to cuts in social
security contributions and spending increases. Most of the tax cuts have ended up in higher
take-home-pay rather than in lower labor costs. A Generation Pact is set to be implemented to
raise employment of the young, low-skilled, and older workers. Key measures include more
targeted cuts in employers’ social security contributions, a gradual reform of early retirement
regimes, and a strengthening of training.
The financial sector, which has never experienced a systemic crisis, has seen its performance
improve over the past two years. Profitability rose, mainly in the banking sector and, to a lesser
extent, in the insurance sector. In the life sector, products with guaranteed returns above market
rates continue to weigh on profits. Since early 2004, the banking and insurance supervisors
have been operating as a single institution (CBFA) to better deal with the dominant bankinsurance conglomerates and increasing cross-border activity. The National Bank has
developed macroprudential supervision and regularly publishes Financial Stability Reviews.
A Financial Stability Committee has been established to ensure seamless coordination between
the CBFA and the NBB and focus on issues of systemic importance. To further combat money
laundering, a law was adopted to phase out all bearer instruments.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for the continued good performance of the
economy and for adopting economic policies guided by a coherent set of medium-term
objectives. Directors observed that measures taken to boost employment rates, deepen
economic deregulation, and further administrative simplification are improving growth prospects.
The maintenance of balanced budgets for six consecutive years has contributed to improved
market confidence and to reduced risk premiums. They underscored that, while policy goals are
appropriate, reforms should be strengthened and rebalanced to achieve both the budget
surpluses envisaged and the higher labor utilization needed to address population aging. In
particular, labor market rigidities should be dealt with more directly, with diminished recourse to
budgetary resources to promote job creation.
Directors viewed that the near-term outlook, while dependent on external developments, is
favorable and that the authorities’ growth projections are realistic. They observed that domestic

-3wage increases, which are set to exceed those of key trading partners, pose a downside risk to
exports and investment in the medium term. Directors concurred that risks related to housing
price developments are limited.
Directors urged the authorities to complement the present emphasis of fiscal policy on reducing
public debt and supporting growth with medium-term spending restraint and a comprehensive
approach to tax reform. They commended the authorities’ track record of meeting announced
budget targets, and welcomed their intention to save revenue windfalls from higher growth and
to take further measures, as needed, to balance the 2006 budget. Directors underscored the
need to adopt specific plans to curb spending. Emphasizing the benefits of a stable tax system,
Directors discouraged the recourse to tax amnesties and ad hoc tax measures to meet revenue
objectives. They supported the shift in the tax burden away from labor, in the context of
comprehensive reforms.
Directors urged the authorities to adhere to the path toward fiscal surpluses, as recommended
by the High Finance Council (HFC). To help achieve such surpluses, they saw merit in adopting
a formal medium-term spending framework, or at a minimum shifting the focus of budget
management to primary balance targets to ensure that the declining interest bill contributes to
consolidation. Directors noted that it will be essential for the HFC to resume its traditional role in
assessing developments in public finance, providing recommendations on the fiscal outlook,
and underpinning the internal stability pact to ensure that policies at various levels of
government are consistent with overall consolidation objectives.
Directors welcomed the Generation Pact as an important step toward higher employment rates,
especially for the young and low-skilled. They noted, however, that, in order to boost
employment of older workers meaningfully, the Pact’s measures should be extended to phase
out early retirement regimes and to improve the employability of such workers. Directors agreed
that addressing labor market rigidities more directly would ensure that the wage-bargaining
framework delivers more job creation, and noted that, to prevent an erosion of competitiveness,
social partners will need to moderate wage increases. The use of reductions in taxes and social
security contributions to boost take-home pay should be avoided, and indexation discontinued.
In this connection, the use of “all-in” nominal wage agreements as an intermediate step was
welcomed. Directors commended reductions in the administrative and regulatory burden on
businesses, and encouraged the authorities to progress with economic deregulation and
product market liberalization.
Directors welcomed the findings of the Financial System Stability Assessment that the financial
sector was stable and resilient, and the authorities’ intention to adopt its recommendations to
further strengthen supervision. They underscored the need to maintain the high quality of
banking supervision in a rapidly changing environment, and to raise insurance and pension
supervision to the same quality. Adequate capacity should be devoted to the oversight and
prudential supervision of the payments and securities settlement systems, while ensuring
seamless coordination among the entities involved. Progress in shaping the Banking, Finance,
and Insurance Commission supported by the National Bank of Belgium’s macro prudential
analysis should continue to preserve the record of financial stability.

-4Directors commended Belgium’s continued commitment to a liberal international trading system
and the recent increase in the level of its official development assistance.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.
