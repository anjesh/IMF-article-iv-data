2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION AND FOURTH
POST-PROGRAM MONITORING DISCUSSIONS

KEY ISSUES
Context: Structural deficiencies are holding back growth and have made the economy
increasingly crisis-prone. Following an initially successful stabilization from the 2011
crisis, stop-go stimulus efforts in 2012—mainly through wage increases and directed
lending—resulted in renewed volatility and kept inflation high.
Challenges: Continued inconsistent policy objectives, a deteriorating current account,
low reserve buffers, and a peak in external debt service obligations pose major
challenges in 2013. Maintaining macroeconomic stability remains the key short-term
policy priority. Over the medium term, the overarching challenge is to increase the
efficiency and competitiveness of the economy through deep structural reform.
Policy Recommendations:
 Reduce directed lending operations and limit wage increases to targeted inflation.
 Maintain exchange rate flexibility.
 Tighten liquidity and stand ready to take further steps to ensure disinflation.
 Curb high foreign exchange lending growth.
 Adopt comprehensive and ambitious structural reforms to improve resource
allocation and lay the basis for a well-functioning market economy.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
2.
Following the 2011 crisis, the economy stabilized in the first half of 2012. Sharp policy
tightening in response to the crisis helped stabilize the exchange rate and achieve a rapid reduction
of inflation from over 100 percent in the last months of 2011—the legacy of the sharp currency
devaluation—to around 20 percent (m-o-m,

Encouraged by the initial success, policies were relaxed too early. As stabilization was
taking hold, the authorities started to progressively relax policies in pursuit of the official 5½ percent

The premature easing and end of the solvent trade windfall led to the return of
pressures in the second half of 2012. Price and exchange rate pressures intensified when the
balance of payments deteriorated rapidly from July, when the solvents trade ended following an
agreement with Russia. Deposit conversions picked up sharply and by October the NBRB was

Early developments in 2013 have been mixed. Inflation spiked to an annualized monthly
rate of 30 percent in January, partly on administrative price increases, but fell in the subsequent two
months and is currently running at 13–16 percent. Meanwhile, GDP growth rebounded strongly
(3½ percent y-o-y in the first quarter). However, average wages grew by almost 8 percent in
seasonally adjusted terms (over 30 percent annualized) during the first three months of the year.
Also, liquidity conditions in the banking system have eased substantially and during March and April
the NBRB reduced its main policy rate by 3 percentage points to 27 percent while indicating that
further reductions are in store—thus signaling a loosening of policies. The exchange rate was
relatively stable in early 2013, but following a 14 percent real appreciation in 2012 it is at risk of
again becoming overvalued, as suggested by CGER methods (Box 1, Figure 3).
Box 1. External Stability Assessment
A CGER-type assessment suggests that the rubel remains broadly in line with fundamentals, but
risks of overvaluation are increasing.
Rubel depreciation in 2012 significantly lagged the large inflation differential with trading
partners, thereby eroding earlier competitiveness gains. The rubel depreciated by 3 percent in
nominal effective terms in 2012. Given the still large inflation differential between Belarus and its
trading partners, this resulted in a 14 percent appreciation in real effective terms, pointing to a
significant deterioration of Belarus’ price competitiveness.

Compared to the estimates from
the 2012 Article IV, the
macroeconomic balance approach
(MB) estimates an increasing gap
between the projected medium-term
current account and the estimated
norm, implying rubel overvaluation
of 11 percent.
Similarly, under the external
sustainability (ES) approach, the
positive gap between the projected
current account and the norm has
shrunk and now suggests
undervaluation of 5.4 percent—
significantly smaller than previously
estimated.

These estimates should be interpreted carefully. The high degree of state control in the Belarus
economy and related administrative interference with price formation significantly weaken the role
of price signals relative to a market based economy, thereby introducing considerable uncertainty
regarding the estimated effectiveness of exchange rate adjustment.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
6.
The outlook is fragile. Against the background of a largely closed output gap and
continued high inflation, the authorities plan to actively pursue an 8½ percent GDP growth target
in 2013. While they are adamant that reducing inflation and preserving macroeconomic stability
remains their priority, the conflicting policy objectives is likely to result in a repeat of the stop-go
policy pattern of 2012. The staff’s baseline scenario therefore assumes growth below and inflation
above the authorities’ target. The trade balance is projected to deteriorate, with reserves falling to
US$6.9 billion by end-2013—equivalent to less than 1½ months of imports.
7.

Large risks surround the outlook (Appendix I).



The key downside risk is that economic stimulus to reach the growth target reignites inflation
and exchange rate pressures.



The banking sector remains under pressure from deteriorating asset quality while rapid FX loan
growth—much of it to unhedged borrowers—is posing further risks.



An intensification of euro area turbulence that were to result in lower euro area growth would
affect Belarus—including via its effects on Russia— mainly through lower external demand.



Successful international debt issuance, privatization, or new bilateral financial support could
alleviate short-term external financing pressures.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
8.
Discussions centered on policies to promote stability and raise potential growth. The
staff’s adjustment scenario illustrates that a combination of consistent macroeconomic policies—
including reduced directed lending, wage moderation, tighter liquidity conditions, control of FX
lending growth, and a flexible exchange rate—and deep structural reform would raise medium-term
growth and reduce external vulnerabilities (Figure 4). Such policies would help improve the current
account and bring inflation to single digits by 2014 while positive confidence effects would spur
capital inflows, allowing an increase in reserves to the equivalent of 4 months of imports by 2018.
The authorities and staff broadly agreed on the assessment of the economic situation but views
differed substantially on the necessary policy actions.

A. Ensuring Sound Fiscal Policies: Containing Directed Lending and Wages
9.
Balanced budget targets hide fiscal risks from quasi-fiscal operations and wages. The
authorities achieved a 0.7 percent general government surplus in 2012 (over-performing their
zero-balance objective) and target a balanced budget for 2013 (Figure 5). However, the authorities’
budget definition does not include quasi-fiscal operations and does not account for the large
contingent liabilities stemming from directed lending. Additional risks stem from large wage
increases specified in the budget.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

7

REPUBLIC OF BELARUS

10.
Directed lending operations create fiscal and broader economic problems. Large-scale
directed and subsidized lending operations are conducted as “lending under government programs”
(LGP, an estimated 3 percent of GDP in 2012), and increasingly via the new Development Bank (an
additional 2 percent of GDP in 2012), among other channels. Part of the lending is funded from
earmarked government deposits while other parts are funded from banks’ own resources. The
directed lending operations at below market rates are a problem for three reasons. First, they fuel
domestic demand excessively. Second, they promote inefficiency and misallocation of resources in
the economy. Third, as many of the loans are provided to ultimately unviable enterprises, the loans
create large contingent liabilities for the government. To illustrate: during 2008–11, the government
had to recapitalize banks to the tune of 2 percent of GDP on average per year.
11.
Planned wage increases risk fueling demand and reducing competitiveness. Budget
sector nominal wages increased 67 percent in 2012 (Dec/Dec, 36 percent in real terms) and a
further 20 percent increase in the so called first-grade wage for the public sector is envisaged
for 2013. These increases pose a macroeconomic challenge because they set a benchmark for the
rest of the economy. To the extent that wage increases exceed productivity growth they contribute
to overheating and declining competitiveness. Separately, a civil service reform package will increase
civil servant wages—which lag wages elsewhere in the economy—by 30 percent, while reducing
staff numbers by the same number to contain overall wage costs to the budget.
Policy Discussion
12.
Staff suggested fiscal measures to contain demand and maintain stability. In particular,
staff recommended: (i) reducing directed lending and related interest rate subsidies; (ii) limiting
wage increases, and (iii) raising the cost-recovery on household utilities to 40 percent. These
measures, which each could yield about ½ percent of GDP, would ensure that the authorities attain
a balanced budget even under the initially somewhat slower but more sustainable growth path in
the staff’s adjustment scenario, while leaving some room for increased capital spending.
13.
Reducing directed lending is key, including to limit contingent risks to public debt.
Directed and subsidized lending fell in 2012, when compared to 2011, but its level remains high at
an estimated 5 percent of GDP and further reductions are needed. The authorities’ commitment to
limit new LGP funded with government deposits to 6 trillion rubel (1 percent of GDP) in 2013 is a
helpful step. However, it will be important to keep this part of LGP below this level over the medium
term—with lending exclusively channeled through the Development Bank—and to fully phase out
directed lending funded by banks’ own resources by 2015. Containing overall directed lending at
this level would be consistent with a gradual decline in public debt under the staff’s reform scenario.
14.
Limiting wage increases would help contain demand and restore competitiveness. To
this end, 2013 wage increases should be limited to 12 percent, in line with the authorities’ end-year
inflation target and the planned increase in the first grade wage should be reconsidered and
brought in line with this objective.
15.
The authorities stressed their commitment to maintaining a balanced budget. They
were confident that the balanced budget target for 2013 would be achieved and pointed to a

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF BELARUS

significant contingency reserve (0.8 percent of GDP) that had been built into the budget. The
authorities also emphasized that there had been no bank recapitalization in 2012 and they expected
that none would be needed this year. This would help contain below-the-line outlays. Coupled with
high projected GDP growth rates, the authorities believed that under their policies public debt ratios
should continue to fall. As to wages, it was argued that the envisaged increase in the first grade
wage implied only a 7 percent real increase, which was not considered unreasonable in light of the
official GDP growth projections.
16.
They regarded subsidized lending as a central component of their social protection
and development strategies. The authorities argued that given high interest rates, subsidized
lending is critical to maintaining economic growth and to finance development priorities—including
housing and the agricultural sector. Moreover, they regarded the government lending programs as
an important catalyst for mobilizing financial sector resources towards meeting these developmental
objectives. The authorities thus planned to continue subsidizing lending, with volumes depending
on prevailing interest rates given a set envelope for subsidies in the budget (3½ percent of GDP).

B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy: Focusing on Price Stability
17.
The monetary stance is at risk of being too loose. The authorities are aiming to achieve
12 percent inflation at end-2013 in the context of an incomplete monetary framework centered on a
short-term inflation objective with supporting benchmarks for monetary aggregates, and a flexible
exchange rate. A lack of forward looking elements and the ad hoc use of multiple instruments—
policy rates, reserve requirements, and administrative measures—are key weaknesses of the
framework. The presence of large volumes of subsidized credit and the increasing importance of
foreign currency lending further complicate the conduct of monetary policy. The current policy
stance is difficult to assess, including because of the sharp volatility in inflation in the first months
of 2013. However, unless the most recent declining inflation trend is sustained, the 12 percent target
is likely to remain out of reach this year. Also, the marked loosening of liquidity conditions in recent
months on increased NBRB liquidity support raises risks (Figure 6).
Policy Discussion
18.
Staff urged the NBRB to tighten liquidity conditions and stand ready to take further
steps to ensure disinflation. In the context of large uncertainty about the likelihood of further
inflation reductions—which will be needed to bring inflation within the 12 percent target—and
continued high inflation expectations, a multi-pronged approach is required. First, the NBRB should
tighten liquidity to align the money market rate with the refinancing rate, and narrow the policy rate
corridor to reduce interest rate volatility. Second, it should use macro-prudential policies to rein in
high foreign currency lending growth (see also below). Third, if the recent inflation reductions are
not continued over the next few months, an increase in policy rates will be needed to ensure further
disinflation. The NBRB should also raise rates without delay if expansionary wage or directed lending
policies were to jeopardize stability, or if significant downward exchange rate pressures were to
reemerge. The NBRB should refrain from administrative measures to curb commercial lending rates,
as these obscure the policy stance and unduly inhibit the operations of banks.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

9

REPUBLIC OF BELARUS

19.
The aim should be for single-digit inflation by no later than 2014. In this context, staff
encouraged the NBRB to make progress toward adoption of an inflation targeting (IT) framework
but underscored that a successful eventual transition to IT would require consistent macroeconomic
policies and broader structural reforms, including enhanced NBRB autonomy, sharply reduced
directed lending, and strengthening of market mechanisms in the financial system.
20.
The flexible exchange rate needs to be maintained to cushion against shocks and
mitigate external imbalances. Intervention should generally be limited to smoothing excessive
exchange rate volatility, while not obstructing the underlying trend in the exchange rate. This said,
given the low reserve levels and the absence of indications of rubel undervaluation, the authorities
should seize on opportunities to build reserves during periods of appreciation pressures.
21.
The authorities shared staff’s concerns regarding inflation, but disagreed on the policy
response. The NBRB and the government conceded that the inflation outlook is uncertain and that
bringing inflation down to 12 percent by year-end would be a challenge. The NBRB indicated it is
therefore planning a cautious approach regarding further monetary policy loosening. Given recent
low investment and GDP growth, however, it did not see a need for policy tightening in the near
future. The government suggested that inflationary pressures could be kept in check by postponing
planned administrative price increases, and it was preparing to do so.
22.
The authorities reaffirmed their commitment to a flexible exchange rate. They agreed
that the exchange rate had been more stable than the inflation-differential with trading partners
warranted and acknowledged deteriorating competitiveness. However, this phenomenon was
ascribed to an increase in FX supply related to high FX borrowing for rubel spending needs. The
authorities also emphasized the need for gradual exchange rate adjustments, given the heightened
sensitivity of the population to sharp rubel movements and the attendant risk of capital flight.

C. Banking Sector Vulnerabilities
23.
Banking supervision is improving but rapid FX lending growth bears close watching.
Recent improvements in the banking code that enhance supervision and improve corporate
governance in banks constitute progress in the institutional framework. However, reported NPLs—
which likely overstate true loan quality1—have risen considerably suggesting ongoing asset quality
deterioration. Even as the reported capital adequacy ratios remain at seemingly comfortable levels,
owing partly to transfers of assets to the Development Bank, this calls for intensive supervision.
Meanwhile, rapid FX lending growth—spurred by the large interest rate differential on rubel loans—
is posing prudential concerns as much of the lending is to unhedged borrowers. The NBRB has
taken measures to curb the growth, including though provisioning requirements and restrictions on
banks’ short-term FX lending. However, their effectiveness has been limited and some measures are

under pressure as the government has called to end the NBRB’s ban on FX lending to households, in
a bid to revive mortgage lending.
Policy Discussion
24.
Staff urged consideration of further measures to curb FX lending growth. In particular,
staff suggested considering higher risk weights for FX loans. It also argued strongly in favor of
maintaining the prohibition of FX lending to households—the elimination of which would risk
exposing households to large FX risks.
25.
The NBRB shared the staff’s concerns, but the government was more sanguine. The
NBRB was deeply concerned about FX lending growth and indicated it would consider further steps,
as suggested by staff, even though they considered their stance as already very firm and worried
about the potential for circumvention of measures. The government, however, was more concerned
about the stifling effect on growth of the high domestic interest rates and argued that risks from
increased FX exposure were acceptable, given the need to boost lending and spur economic growth.

D. Structural Reform: Boosting Potential Growth and Competitiveness
26.
Deep structural reform is critical to achieving higher sustainable growth. The urgency
of structural reform is underscored by Russia’s WTO accession—which is increasing competition for
Belarus’ products in the Russian and domestic market—and increasing labor migration away from
Belarus, especially of the higher-skilled. To cope with these trends, reforms are needed in several
areas including the financial sector, where the role of the new Development Bank is critical, and the
real sector. Structural reforms would bring improved macroeconomic stability, competitiveness
gains, and increased flows of FDI. Indeed, previous staff analysis suggests that deregulation to the
level of Eastern Europe’s most liberalized economies could raise Belarus’ potential growth by up to
6 percentage points during the catch-up phase.

Financial Sector Reform and the Development Bank (DB)
27.
The current course of the DB risks increasing the amount of directed lending in the
economy. When the DB was established in 2011, it offered the prospect of containing directed
lending by combining it in a single entity and allowing the banking system to operate on
commercial terms. However, as the bank is taking shape, it is at risk of becoming a vehicle for more
directed lending, in addition to traditional channels. A recent presidential decree broadened the
mandate of the DB and its sources of financing. The DB will now finance large strategic investment
projects and provide subsidized lending to the export sector. It also issues debt (2½ percent of GDP
to date) and has been actively seeking to have its debt eligible as collateral for NBRB refinancing.
28.
Transfers of outstanding LGP from state banks are relatively small. In 2012
US$600 million in outstanding LGP loans were transferred, out of a total stock of US$10 billion
(17 percent of GDP). As the transferred loans—which are considered to be among the state banks’
lower quality assets—were exchanged at par value the transfers effectively entail a recapitalization
of the state banks. A further loan transfer of US$500 million is planned to take place by July 2013. It
is expected that this will complete the transfer, leaving close to 90 percent of past LGPs with the
banks. Similarly, the DB has assumed about 15 percent of the flow of new directed lending under
government programs, but there are no plans to move the remainder away from the banks.
Policy Discussion
29.
Staff continued to advocate making the DB the sole and transparent provider of
directed lending. It recommended developing and adopting a time-bound plan for the transfer of
all new directed lending from state banks to the DB by 2015. By removing an important obstacle for
banks to operate on more commercial terms, these measures would help improve the efficiency of
the banking system and the allocation of credit. Staff recommended that total new lending by the
DB be capped at 1 percent of GDP per year over the medium term, consistent with fiscal objectives.
It emphasized the need for close oversight and full transparency of the DB’s operations and related
contingent liabilities, which need to be adequately reflected in the budget. DB bonds should not be
eligible as collateral for NBRB refinancing to preclude effective monetization of lending. Also, the DB
should avoid debt issuance to finance new subsidized lending, as this could create large contingent
risks to the government in the context of already high public debt.
30.
The authorities, in contrast, have come to view the DB as critical to provide long-term
financing to the economy. They argued that financial markets are underdeveloped and as a result
long-term financing of investment projects by commercial banks is limited. The DB was therefore
modeled on successful development banks in other countries, and the idea of having the DB as the
sole provider of government-directed lending was largely abandoned. Rather, the DB would be
effectively competing with other commercial banks for resources from the government, either
through direct deposits or interest rate subsidies. The authorities stressed that DB lending will be
only provided to good quality projects with high returns.

Other Structural Reforms
31.
Progress on real sector reforms is slow and has in some cases also been reversed. The
government has made welcome progress with tax reform and a new bankruptcy law. The so-called
“Directive #4” that was adopted in 2010 contains a broad range of measures to improve the
business environment, but has been only partially implemented. A reduction in the number of
consumer goods subject to price controls was reversed during the 2011 crisis. The privatization
agenda has stalled as the National Investment and Privatization Agency (NIPA) has yet to sell any of
the eight small companies it was tasked to privatize, while other companies have been nationalized.
The authorities’ main new initiative to improve productivity is a centralized modernization project
that provides enterprises with subsidized loans based on government-approved, enterprise-specific
modernization proposals, but without significant changes to the overall business environment.
Policy Discussion
32.

The staff urged ambitious and comprehensive reforms (Box 2).



Price liberalization is needed to ensure that prices reflect resource scarcity. The staff
recommended progressive reduction of controls on prices of goods and services, with a view to
fully eliminate them on an ambitious time table. Also, efforts to raise cost recovery in utilities
and transport—currently around 22 and 43 percent, respectively—should be stepped up.
Macroeconomic policy would need to be appropriately tight to counter the upward effects of
price liberalization on inflation. SOEs should be allowed to set their wages without reference to
public sector pay grades. The practice of requiring enterprises to justify their prices with so
called “price calculations” should be eliminated.



Privatization and enterprise reform are critical to improve the efficiency of businesses. In
this regard, staff urged speeding up the privatization of small- and medium-size enterprises,
including by concluding the NIPA pilot privatization project and by creating a pipeline of
enterprises to be privatized on an expedited timeline. Larger companies should be either
privatized or restructured and brought on a commercial basis in a short time-frame and there is
an urgent need for a comprehensive strategy for SOE restructuring. Staff expressed concern
about provisions in the draft privatization law that aim to continue state interference in
privatized companies and urged to reconsider these measures.



WTO accession would help improve access to foreign markets. The staff strongly supported
the authorities recently stepped up efforts towards WTO accession (including the resumption of
the work of the WTO working party on Belarus’ accession).


Social safety nets should be strengthened to mitigate the impact on the most vulnerable.

33.
The authorities agreed with the need for structural reform in principle, but
emphasized trade-offs and risks. Policy makers stressed the importance of the overall economic
environment, including external factors, for the speed and sequencing of structural reform, arguing

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

REPUBLIC OF BELARUS

that reform at the current juncture was fraught with risk. They also pointed out that price
liberalization tended to conflict with efforts to reduce still-high inflation. The authorities therefore
preferred a gradual approach to reform. As an example, regarding privatization efforts, following
best-practice procedures that secured broad support from workers was viewed as more important
than the speed or scale of the process. The authorities also emphasized that their enterprise
modernization initiative includes modernizing the economic model of state-owned enterprises by
introducing new elements of corporate governance, and improving incentives of management and
personnel within the existing system.
Box 2. Recommended Structural Reform Measures
Specific measures recommended by staff for implementation over the next 1-3 years:
Financial sector reform
 Complete transfer of existing LGP from state banks to the DB by the end of 2014.


Channel all new subsidized and directed lending exclusively through the DB, and cap total
amount of such lending at 1 percent of GDP, by end 2015.

Product, trade, and labor market reform
 Shorten the list of socially important goods subject to price regulation to the 2011 level
without delay, and fully phase out the list by mid-2014.


Raise cost recovery on household utilities from below 30 percent at present to 40 percent by
end-2013 and 55 percent by end-2014.



Raise cost recovery on transport tariffs from below 50 percent at present to 90 percent by
end-2013 and 100 percent by end-2014.



Abolish “price calculation” requirements without delay.



Phase out price regulation for various services by repealing relevant acts by end 2014.



Make adherence to the government’s “single pay grading system” voluntary for SOEs.



Make efforts toward changing Belarus’ status to that of a market economy to facilitate WTO
accession.

Privatization and enterprise reform
 Complete the NIPA pilot privatization project by privatizing all eight currently shortlisted
companies by end-2013; create a pipeline of companies to be privatized expeditiously.


Phase out mandatory economic targets, including SOE production targets, by end 2014.



Prepare, by mid-2014, a time-bound program for SOE restructuring, including the removal of
soft budget constraints and end of line-ministry control over SOEs.

Social safety nets
 Increase the cap on unemployment benefits, eliminate gaps in the provision of targeted social
assistance, and move from quarterly to monthly indexation of benefits.

CAPACITY TO REPAY AND FUND RELATIONS
34.
Belarus’ capacity to repay remains strained.
Increasing debt ratios, a deteriorating current account, low
forex reserves, and a peak in external debt service in 2013–
15—including repayments to the Fund of US$1.7 billion
in 2013 and US$1.4 billion in 2014—are compounding
repayment risks. Although on the staff’s baseline scenario
Belarus should be able to meet its external obligations in
the short run, without additional external financing
reserves would be on a downward trend leaving Belarus
vulnerable to negative domestic or external shocks.
35.
The authorities are considering various
avenues to raise additional financing. Under the ACF
program the authorities have committed to privatize
state-owned assets for an amount of US$2½ billion, but
assets that could be sold to meet this condition are yet to
be identified.2 The authorities are also discussing other
new bilateral arrangements with Russia which could
potentially raise large amounts of external financing.
Separately, in light of sharply reduced yields benefitting
from the exceptional market conditions, the government
is considering floating a euro bond and has held two road
shows in recent months.

STAFF APPRAISAL
36.
Belarus’ economic model is increasingly untenable, resulting in poor policy outcomes.
The Belarus economy is the least reformed in Europe and high state control of the economy
restrains productivity growth and competitiveness. Short-term policy efforts to boost growth
beyond the economy’s capacity resulted in large external imbalances and a crisis in 2011 and caused
new volatility in 2012. The authorities’ 8½ percent growth target for 2013 jeopardizes attainment of
the 12 percent inflation target, and risks a repeat of the stop-go policy pattern of 2012.
37.
Strong and predictable macroeconomic policies are essential to promote stability.
Policies in 2013 should be squarely focused on further reducing inflation and containing the
reemerging external imbalances. This requires steady policies and a tight management of domestic
demand. To ensure their effectiveness, fiscal and monetary policies should be closely coordinated.

38.
A further sharp reduction in directed and subsidized lending operations is needed. The
reduction in directed lending in 2012 is welcome, but its level remains high and substantial
additional lowering to a level below 1 percent of GDP is needed over the medium term. The
remaining directed lending should be fully channeled through the Development Bank, and
adequately reflected in the budget while directed lending through commercial banks should be
phased out.
39.
Wage growth should not exceed targeted inflation in 2013. To avoid fueling domestic
demand and help recover lost competitiveness, nominal wage growth should be contained to no
more than 12 percent, in line with the authorities’ official end-year inflation target. The
government’s plans to raise the first grade wage by over 20 percent, which will set the tone for wage
increases in the wider economy, should be reconsidered.
40.
The NBRB should tighten liquidity and stand ready to take further measures to ensure
disinflation. The NBRB should tighten liquidity conditions to align the market rate with the main
policy rate. Also, if recent inflation gains are not continued, a policy rate increase will be needed to
ensure further disinflation. Rates should also be raised if expansionary wage or directed lending
policies were to jeopardize stability or if exchange rate pressures reemerge. Meanwhile, it is critical
that the exchange rate remains flexible, to buffer against shocks and discourage dollarization.
41.
Banking supervision has improved, but high FX lending growth poses risks. Recent
improvements in the banking code are welcome. However, rapid FX lending growth is posing risks,
with much of the lending directed to unhedged borrowers. Additional measures by the NBRB to
curb such lending should be considered, including higher risk weights on FX loans. The prohibition
of FX lending to households should be maintained.
42.
Deep structural reform remains critical to achieving higher sustainable growth. The
government has made progress with tax reform and a new bankruptcy law, but there have been
setbacks in price liberalization and privatization. To boost productivity and competitiveness, and
unleash Belarus’ growth potential, a comprehensive and ambitious reform agenda is needed. This
would include price liberalization, privatization and state-owned enterprise restructuring, and
targeted social safety nets. The government’s modernization initiative, while containing useful
elements, is unlikely to bring the needed change in the absence of such deeper reforms.
43.
The Development Bank should be used to facilitate broader financial sector reform. By
aiming to turn the DB into a vehicle for yet more directed lending, the authorities are missing an
opportunity to improve the efficiency of the financial sector and the allocation of credit in the
economy. In the staff’s view, large benefits remain to be had from making the DB the sole provider
of directed lending and allowing the banking system to operate on fully commercial terms. In any
event, DB debt should not be eligible as collateral for NBRB refinancing so as to preclude effective
monetization of DB lending.
44.

It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

1/ Projections are shown at the official exchange rate.
2/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms, g = real GDP growth rate, e = nominal
appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
3/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
4/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
5/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
6/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
7/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels of the last projection year.

1/ Gross debt of general government (including guarantees) and of monetary authorities. Includes estimated bank recapitalization of 2 percent of GDP per annum based on 2008-11 historical average.
2/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; a = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Safeguards Assessments:
Voluntary (non-program related) assessment of the NBRB was completed in April 2004. The
assessment concluded that significant vulnerabilities existed in the safeguards framework, especially
in the areas of the legal structure and independence, external and internal audit, and in financial
reporting. The assessment made specific recommendations to correct the identified shortcomings.
An updated assessment of the NBRB, which was completed in May 2009 in connection with the
Stand-By Arrangement approved on January 12, 2009, found little progress in addressing previously
2

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF BELARUS

identified vulnerabilities. The assessment determined that risks have increased since the
voluntary 2004 assessment and recommended the following measures:


Adopting a new law that provides operational and financial independence for the NBRB to
ensure the effectiveness of the NBRB’s internal and external audit mechanisms and the control
systems,



Conducting special audits of NIR and NDA data to reduce the risk of misreporting,



Divesting the NBRB’s investment in non-financial subsidiaries, and



Publishing the audited IFRS financial statements.

The NBRB implemented only some of the recommendations. Special audits of NIR and NDA data for
March, June, September and December 2009 test dates were completed. The NBRB divested most of
its non-financial subsidiaries in 2011, but also increased involvement in quasi-fiscal activities, e.g., in
the first half of 2011 the NBRB purchased bonds issued by domestic banks at higher than market
prices and subsequently sold them to the Development Bank to acquire bonds issued by the latter.
While the new Banking Law provides some improvement over its previous version, NBRB autonomy
is still undermined, in particular, by powers of the President to amend the NBRB Statute at any time,
to direct NBRB operations by his decrees, and to dismiss Board members.
Exchange Arrangements:
The currency of Belarus is the Belarusian rubel, which was introduced in 1994.
The de jure exchange rate regime is managed float. The NBRB has been officially pegging the rubel
against a basket of currencies, including the U.S. dollar, the euro and the Russian ruble within
horizontal bands from January 2 2009, although the rubel has remained in a 2 percent band from
May 2010 through April 2011 vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar, during which time the de facto exchange rate
arrangement was classified as a stabilized arrangement.
Following substantial loss of reserves in Q1 2011, the NBRB ceased interventions and a heavily
depreciated black market exchange rate emerged. The NBRB devalued the official exchange rate in
May 2011 but the parallel exchange market persisted, giving rise to a multiple exchange rate system.
On October 20, 2011 the NBRB unified the exchange rates at the market rate by introducing a single
trading session, abolished the official exchange rate bands and announced introduction of a
managed floating regime. Since then, the NBRB has been using official exchange interventions
sparingly to smooth excessive fluctuations. Therefore, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has
been reclassified to other managed arrangement from a stabilized arrangement, effective
October 20, 2011.
Belarus accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the IMF’s Articles of
Agreement on November 5, 2001. Following the unification of the exchange rates in October 2011,

the authorities lifted some of the earlier introduced administrative controls. An Article VIII mission
took place recently and the staff is in the process of finalizing its review of the jurisdictional
implications of the new regime and remaining FX controls.
UFR/Article IV Consultation:
Belarus is on a 12-month consultation cycle. The last Article IV consultation was concluded on
May 4, 2012 and a report was published on
http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2012/cr12113.pdf
Stand-By Arrangement:
A 15-month Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) in the amount of SDR 1.6 billion (US$2.5 billion,
418.8 percent of quota) was approved by the Executive Board (Country Report No. 09/109) on
January 12, 2009. An augmentation of the SBA was approved on June 29, 2009 in conjunction with
the completion of the first review (Country Report No. 09/260), bringing the Fund’s financial support
to SDR 2.3 billion (US$3.5 billion, 587.3 percent of quota). The final review was completed on
March 26, 2010. Total disbursements under the program amounted to SDR 2.3 billion
(US$3.5 billion).
FSAP Participation, ROSCs, and OFC Assessments:
Two FSAP missions took place in 2004 and an FSSA report was published on
http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.cfm?sk=18367.0.

REPUBLIC OF BELARUS

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
A. The World Bank Group Strategy
1.
The World Bank Group (WBG) Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for FY 2008–11 provided for a
selective presence to support structural reforms and buttress the Government’s programs of
improving energy efficiency, water supply quality, waste management, road upgrading, and
developing infrastructure in Chernobyl-affected areas. Analytic and advisory work has comprised a
core element of the WBG engagement. The WBG has developed a wide program of analytical and
advisory support to Belarus, including Agricultural Policy Note (FY 2009), Financial Sector
Assessment Program (FY 2009, jointly with the IMF), IFC SME survey report “Business Environment in
Belarus 2010”, Economic Policy Notes (FY 2011), Country Economic Memorandum and Volume 1 of
the Programmatic Public Expenditure Review (FY 2012). These products have underpinned the
WBG’s policy dialogue on key structural reforms in Belarus. To date, the IBRD lending commitments
in Belarus total US$865 million for 10 projects. US$23.6 million was provided as grants to support
about 30 national programs. In addition, IFC has invested about $340 million in 36 projects in the
financial, general manufacturing, agribusiness, and services sectors.
2.
The IFC strategy aims at providing advisory services and investment operations to foster
private sector development. IFC’s advisory services under Belarus Regulatory Simplification and
Investment Generation Program (August 2010–September 2013) focus on improvement of the
business environment and investment climate, particularly regulatory simplification related to
business operations, as well as on building government capacity for investment generation. IFC
Belarus Food Safety advisory project (June 2010–September 2013) endeavors to increase the
competitiveness of Belarusian food producers by improving their food safety practices, raising
awareness and facilitating wider implementation of best international food safety management
practices. To date, the IFC investment commitments in Belarus total approximately US$340 million,
divided almost equally between financial markets and the real sector. IFC’s investments will continue
to focus on financial markets, general manufacturing, climate change and agribusiness sectors, and
are expected to exceed $100 million per year.
3.
The World Bank Group (WBG) is currently preparing a new Country Partnership Strategy (CPS)
for Belarus which will replace the previous CAS and cover the period of 2014–17. The WBG is
consulting with the government, development partners, civil society and other stakeholders to
identify priorities for WBG assistance for the coming four years. Through the new CPS the WBG will
continue to support Belarus in the implementation of structural reforms to promote inclusive
growth, enhance economic competitiveness, facilitate the integration into the world economy and
improve public services, including social protection of the most vulnerable. The annual lending
envelope for the coming years, specific projects and the range of instruments will be determined in
the context of the CPS. Analytic and advisory work will continue to be a core element of the WBG
engagement. Building on the foundation laid during the previous CAS period, the Bank will continue
to deepen its analytical program, including through programmatic analytical and technical
assistance in the areas of fiscal policies, structural reforms, private and financial sector development,
and trade, including support for Belarus’s WTO accession.

B. IMF-World Bank Group Collaboration in Specific Areas
4.
The Bank and the Fund teams work closely in calibrating and delivering their assistance. The
IMF plays a key role at the macro level, while the World Bank Group focuses on the structural reform
agenda, energy efficiency, infrastructure and social and environmental issues. Recent examples of
close cooperation and coordination between the Bank Group and the Fund include discussions
under the IMF SBA post program monitoring and during the preparation of the CEM, and joint work
with the Government working group on structural reforms issues, and the joint support in the
development of a Medium-Term Debt Strategy (MTDS).

Areas in Which the World Bank Group Leads
5.
Structural reforms, social issues, and private business development. The Bank’s Country
Economic Memorandum (CEM)—which was presented to the authorities in July 2012—outlined clear
priorities for structural reforms, including further liberalization of factor and product markets to
support a more efficient allocation of resources in the economy, transformation of the State-Owned
Enterprises (SOEs) and enhancing of private sector growth, including the services sector. The Bank
will continue to support the design and implementation of structural reforms through its
programmatic structural reform technical assistance. Through the privatization TA (largely funded
through a donor Trust Fund) it will also continue to provide advice on legal and institutional
instruments and implementation capacities to successfully launch an enterprise privatization
program that is on par with international best practice. The IFC delivers an active advisory program
around challenges facing the private sector and international “best practices” for improving the
business regulatory environment and investment climate. The Bank will focus on improving the
efficiency of public spending in the context of the programmatic Public Expenditure Review,
including in social sectors and technical assistance to support improved medium-term fiscal
planning and debt management. Using the newly available Labor Market Survey, the World Bank will
expand and deepen the work on labor market reform, initiated in the CEM. The World Bank will
provide targeted analytical and technical assistance to support Belarus’ WTO accession.
6.
Energy sector. Currently, three energy efficiency projects are being implemented in Belarus
with World Bank’s financial support: Post Chernobyl Recovery Project (PCRP) (US$50 million) and
Additional Financing to PCRP (US$30 million), and Energy Efficiency Project (EEP) (US$125 million).
7.
Road Transport. The Road Upgrading and Modernization Project (US$150 million) is aimed at
developing Belarusian transport infrastructure on a strategic route, the Trans-European Transport
Corridor IX, connecting the Black Sea with the Baltic countries.
8.
Environment. The Bank supports Belarus’ efforts in strengthening its environment institutions,
addressing key public health challenges, and complying with its international commitments. A TA
project is currently under implementation: (i) the GEF Grant Project (US$5.5 million) for Persistent
Organic Pollutant (POPs) Stockpile Management and Technical/Institutional Capacity Upgrading.
Progress is being made towards achieving improved water, wastewater and solid waste
management services under the Water Supply and Sanitation Project (US$60 million) and Solid
Waste Management Project (US$42.5 million).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Areas of Shared Responsibility
9.
Macroeconomic development. The two institutions discuss and consult with each other in
the preparation of macroeconomic framework and debt sustainability analysis, as well as in the
preparation of analytical pieces on macro-growth issues.
10. Public expenditure management. The Bank will focus on improving the efficiency of public
spending. The first volume of the programmatic Public Expenditure Review focused on spending
efficiency in agriculture, energy, social assistance and pension sectors. The Bank will deliver the
Public Expenditure Review 2 in FY 2013, focusing on intergovernmental fiscal relations, and the
efficiency of public spending in health and education. The Fund, jointly with the Bank, has been
working on supporting the authorities in their fiscal consolidation effort, including technical
assistance on expenditure rationalization.
11. Debt management. Debt management is an area of priority reform for Belarus. The Bank has
conducted a Debt Management Performance Assessment (DeMPA) in Belarus in FY 2011 and a Debt
Management Reform Plan in FY 2012, suggesting key areas for further improvements of debt
management in Belarus. One of the key priorities identified—development of a debt management
strategy—was supported through a joint World Bank and IMF technical assistance mission on the
development of a Medium-Term Debt Strategy (MTDS) in Belarus. The Bank and the Fund will
continue to provide joint support in this area.
12.
Financial sector. The Bank and the Fund will jointly support the authorities in addressing key
vulnerabilities in the financial sector and designing needed reforms. The Bank and the IMF are
collaborating in financial sector monitoring, including on key developments, such as the newly
established Development Bank. The World Bank will maintain an active dialogue with the authorities
on, inter alia, state bank governance, restructuring and privatization, financial consumer protection
and financial literacy, as well as on reforms in the securities and insurance sectors.

Areas in which the IMF Leads
13. The IMF is actively engaged with the authorities in discussing the macroeconomic program,
providing technical assistance and related support, including support on economic and financial
statistics, tax policy, monetary operations, and fiscal transparency. The IMF is leading the dialogue
on setting objectives for monetary and exchange rate policies, overall budget envelope, and tax
policy.
14. The IMF analysis in these areas serves as an input to the Bank’s policy advice. The Bank and
the IMF teams have regular consultations, and Bank staff takes part in IMF Article IV Consultations.
This helps to ensure consistency of policy recommendations by the two institutions.
Questions may be referred to Sebastian Eckardt (Senior Economist, ECSPE, 202-458-7954), and

STATISTICAL ISSUES (AS OF APRIL 1, 2013)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General:
Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. The most affected
area is external debt data.
National Accounts:
The National Statistics Committee (NSC) compiles and disseminates quarterly and annual GDP
estimates at current and constant prices following the 1993 System of National Accounts. The quality
of the estimates is good, and the timeliness and periodicity exceed the Special Data Dissemination
Standard (SDDS) requirements. In addition to the quarterly and annual estimates, a monthly GDP is
compiled 15 days after the end of the reference month. The NSC compiles annually a full set of
accounts (up to the financial accounts), institutional sector accounts, and input-output tables. It has
started the compilation of experimental estimates of regional GDP at current and constant prices—
monthly, quarterly and annual. The accuracy of the source data is good, and the statistical techniques
used are sound. The national accounts estimates are internally consistent, and they are also consistent
with other macroeconomic statistics. All other real sector data are disseminated in accordance with the
SDDS requirements.
Price Statistics:
The CPI covers 31 towns in the country and the PPI covers approximately 1,700 industrial
organizations, and they are published monthly. The NSC also publishes indices for foodstuffs, nonfood goods, and services. The CPI and PPI are based on weights from 2011.
Government finance statistics:
Government finance statistics are compiled in broad compliance with the recommendations of the
Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001). Areas that need improvement include
classification of some expenses (e.g. subsidies to corporations, social benefits to households, capital
transfers to corporations); inconsistency between GFS and monetary data; valuation of assets and
liabilities (at nominal or market value); and compilation for public corporations.
Monetary statistics:
Monetary and Financial Statistics are compiled by the National Bank of the Republic of Belarus (NBRB),
broadly following the methodology of the IMF’s Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM). The
NBRB has implemented most of STA recommendations regarding monetary statistics.
External sector statistics:
The NBRB publishes quarterly balance of payments and international investment position statements
in the BPM5 format (for 1996–2011) and in the BPM6 format since 2012 (revised data available
from 2005). Overall the timeliness and serviceability of external sector data is satisfactory, although
there are gaps in external debt data, in particular gross external debt statistics. While the BMP6
requires debt statistics to be reported in net terms, compiling of gross external debt statistics remains
important.
II. Data Standards and Quality
A data ROSC report was published on
Belarus subscribed to the Special Data
February 1, 2005.
Dissemination System (SDDS) on
December 22, 2004 and met all SDDS
requirements at the time of subscription.

2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION AND FOURTH
May 21, 2013

POST-PROGRAM MONITORING DISCUSSIONS—
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION
1.
This supplement provides information on the preliminary findings of a recent
Article VIII mission that took place after the Article IV mission. The information does not
alter the thrust of the staff appraisal, but adds an additional element to the staff’s assessment.
2.
The Article VIII mission identified several exchange restrictions and multiple
currency practices. Specifically, it identified the following measures that are subject to the
Fund’s jurisdiction: (1) exchange restrictions arising from the requirement of an NBRB permit
for (i) advance payments for imports and (ii) payments for imports with delivery outside of
Belarus, and (2) multiple currency practices (MCPs) arising from (i) the potential deviation by
more than two percent of the exchange rates in the over-the-counter (OTC) market and the
BCSE exchange, and (ii) the potential deviation by more than two percent of the exchange
rate in the OTC market and the exchange rate determined at the BCSE and/or the official
exchange rate in the mandatory sale by resident legal entities of unused FX and FX amounts
subject to the surrender requirement not exceeding US$1,000. Staff continues to analyze
other features of Belarus’ foreign exchange system that may have jurisdictional implications
and will provide a further update once the assessment is finalized.
3.
The authorities have indicated their intention to remove the identified measures.
They are studying the preliminary findings and are awaiting the final report of the Article VIII
mission. Meanwhile, the authorities have indicated that they are committed to the elimination
of the measures in a careful manner that minimizes the risk of unexpected adverse effects on
the balance of payments. They expect to be in full compliance with their Article VIII
obligations by end-2014.
4.
At this time, the authorities do not request, and the staff does not recommend,
Board approval of the identified exchange restrictions and MCPs. The staff welcomes the
authorities’ intention to eliminate such measures and encourages them to do this as soon as
possible.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with
Belarus and Fourth Post-Program Monitoring Discussions
On May 24, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation and Fourth Post-Program Monitoring discussions with Belarus.1
Background
Following the 2011 crisis, the economy stabilized in early 2012. Sharp policy tightening in
response to the crisis helped stabilize the exchange rate and achieve a rapid reduction of
inflation. At the same time, the balance of payments improved markedly owing in part to a
temporary large-scale trade in solvents and related products.
Since then, stop-go stimulus efforts have resulted in renewed volatility and kept inflation at a
high level. During the first half of the year, policies were relaxed in pursuit of the official
5½ percent GDP growth target for 2012. The National Bank of the Republic of Belarus (NBRB)
refinancing rate was rapidly reduced, and real wages grew much faster than productivity. The
policy loosening together with the end of the solvent trade led to the return of price and
exchange rate pressures in the fall of 2012. To stem pressures, liquidity conditions were
tightened again with an increase in reserve requirements and restrictions on banks’ access to
refinancing. The measures helped calm market conditions toward the end of the year. Early
developments in 2013 have been mixed. Monthly inflation has fallen and GDP growth has
rebounded strongly. However, average wages have grown briskly during the first quarter. Also,
liquidity conditions in the banking system have eased substantially and the NBRB has further
reduced its main policy rate—signaling another loosening of policies.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

2
On structural reform, welcome steps were recently taken on tax reform and a new bankruptcy
law. However, the privatization and price liberalization agendas have stalled. Meanwhile, the
Development Bank’s broadened mandate and sources of financing risk further distorting the
efficient allocation of credit and potentially create large contingent liabilities for the government.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the authorities’ efforts to regain macroeconomic stability
following the 2011 crisis, but noted that policies had been prematurely loosened. Efforts to
boost growth have resulted in renewed pressures on the exchange rate, inflation and the
current account, while extensive state control of the economy continues to restrain productivity
growth and competitiveness. Against this background, Directors expressed concern about the
authorities’ pursuit of inconsistent growth and inflation targets and urged the authorities to
improve the consistency and predictability of their policies, and to focus on restoring stability,
rebuilding policy buffers, and implementing deep structural reforms.
Directors emphasized the need for a tight management of domestic demand to further reduce
inflation, contain reemerging external imbalances, and ensure adequate capacity to meet
external obligations. They welcomed the recent reduction in directed lending and recommended
a further substantial reduction to a level below one percent of GDP over the medium term.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to a balanced budget, but stressed the
importance of reflecting fiscal risks from quasi-fiscal operations and directed lending in the
budget. Nominal wage growth should not exceed the target inflation rate in 2013 to avoid fueling
domestic demand and to help recover lost competitiveness.
Directors agreed that the NBRB should tighten liquidity conditions and stand ready to increase
the policy rate if the recent declining trend in inflation is not sustained. They emphasized the
importance of maintaining exchange rate flexibility as a buffer against shocks and to discourage
dollarization, and took note of the authorities’ commitment to eliminate remaining exchange
restrictions and multiple currency practices.
Directors commended recent improvements in the banking code that enhance supervision.
They expressed concern about rapid foreign currency lending growth, much of it to unhedged
borrowers, and encouraged the NBRB to consider additional measures to curb such lending,
and to maintain the prohibition on such lending to households. Developments in non-performing
loans also warrant close monitoring. Directors were generally of the view that the development
bank should become the sole provider of directed lending, thus allowing the banking system to
operate on fully commercial terms, and agreed that development bank debt should not be
eligible as collateral for central bank refinancing.
Directors underscored the need for deep structural reform to achieve higher sustainable growth.
They welcomed recent progress on tax reform and the new bankruptcy law, but noted that
progress in other areas has been limited. To boost productivity and competitiveness, a
well-sequenced, comprehensive reform agenda is needed, including price liberalization,
privatization and restructuring of state-owned enterprises, and targeted social safety nets.

Statement by Mr. Prader, Executive Director for the Republic of Belarus
and Mr. Misyukovets, Alternate Executive
May 24, 2013
The Belarusian authorities appreciate the useful dialogue with the Fund staff during the 2013
Article IV Consultation and the fourth Post-Program Monitoring discussions. They broadly
agree with the staff’s assessment of the current macroeconomic situation and their
recommendations on economic and financial policies. The Fund’s continuous technical
assistance across the spectrum of macroeconomic management issues is also greatly
appreciated.
Macroeconomic Developments in 2012
Since the fall of 2011, Belarus has been steadfastly pursuing a set of policies with a firm
focus on macroeconomic stabilization. The floating exchange rate regime, monetary
tightening, and disciplined fiscal stance have enabled the authorities to address vulnerabilities
in a consistent manner. The implementation of these policies in 2012 has ensured financial
stability and macroeconomic balance as is evidenced by:


a drastic reduction in the rate of inflation—inflation was brought down to
21.8 percent in 2012, as compared to 108.7 percent in 2011, broadly in line with the
authorities’ projections;



stable and predictable exchange rate—the exchange rate has been determined by
the demand and supply for foreign currency in the domestic market with limited
central bank interventions; during 2012, the rubel depreciated by 2.6 percent against
the U.S. dollar;



preservation of international reserves—foreign exchange reserves have recovered
from the 2011 slump and amounted to US$ 8.1 billion as of January 1, 2013 while all
external and domestic foreign exchange obligations of the state were fully honored;



improved balance of payments—the trade balance improved from a deficit of
2 percent of GDP in 2011 to a surplus of 4.6 percent of GDP in 2012; this in turn
eased pressure on the current account deficit which narrowed from 8.5 percent of
GDP at the end of 2011 to 2.9 percent of GDP in 2012 and was covered by a net
inflow of foreign direct investments (2.2percent of GDP) and external borrowing;



stable domestic financial market—the banks remained adequately capitalized
at 20.85 with an admissible share of non-performing loans of 5.5percent as of
January 1, 2013; in total, rubel deposits grew by 58percent, of which household
deposits in the national currency grew by 75 percent, reflecting the growing
confidence in the banking system and progress in addressing dollarization; and

2


strengthened social stability—households’ incomes returned to the pre-crisis level.

On April 17, 2013, Standard & Poor’s revised its sovereign rating outlook on Belarus and,
subsequently, the outlook on Belarus’ capital, Minsk, and major banks to positive from
stable. On April 30, 2013, the Eurasian Anti-Crisis Fund made a fifth disbursement of US$
440 million in recognition of the progress achieved by Belarus in meeting its targets under
the US$ 3 billion stabilization arrangement.
In 2012, GDP grew by 1.5 percent. The modest growth pace in 2012 is attributable to policy
tightening in line with the authorities’ commitment to maintaining stability as well as to
adverse external developments that affected Belarus’ exports in the second half of 2012.
Developments in 2013 and Short-Term Outlook
In 2013, strengthening macroeconomic fundamentals for a balanced growth remains
the overarching objective. The authorities reconfirm their commitment to building strong
macroeconomic fundamentals as a pre-requisite for sustainable long-term economic growth.
A balanced budget, conservative monetary policy, and flexible exchange rate will continue to
be their principal macroeconomic policy instruments.
Growth has been moderate in the first four months of 2013. The economy expanded by
2.5 percent, mirroring both the continuous decline in demand in Belarus’ main trading
partners and additional policy tightening aimed at containing inflation. On the positive side,
labor productivity outpaced GDP growth in the first quarter (3.5 percent) and increased by
4.5 percent. The balance of trade in goods and services in January-March was positive at
US$ 426.4 million, or 3 per cent of GDP.
The focus is on containing inflation. In response to a surge in inflation of 3.0 percent in
January, remedial measures were taken to bring it down to 1.2 percent in February,
1.1 percent in March and further to 0.5 percent in April. This downward trend is expected to
continue and allows the authorities to be confident that the inflation target for 2013 of
12 percent (December to December) will be met. An analysis shows that, as was the case
in 2012, inflation has been largely fueled by the need to increase regulated utility and public
transport tariffs and to raise excise taxes under the Common Economic Space price
alignment agreements. Core inflation, in turn, rose by 2.8 percent in January and, following a
prompt monetary response, dropped to 0.6 percent in February and 0.6 percent in March. In
view of these factors, readjustments in the plan to increase utility tariffs may be warranted at
this junction but the objective to reach full utility cost coverage in 2015 remains unchanged.
Real interest rates are firmly positive. Strengthened monetary and exchange stability, weak
demand for credit and the evident downward inflation trajectory have increased the real value
of the refinancing rate to above 10 percent p.a. In these circumstances, very high interest

3
rates in the economy (at about 40 percent p.a. for new deposits in February-March) have led
to the fastest growth in household rubel deposits over the last 10 years. While the demand for
credit continues to be low, these developments begin to adversely affect the balance of assets
and liabilities of the banking sector. In addition, a considerable growth of household deposits
coupled with a high supply of foreign exchange in the market has boosted rubel liquidity of
the banking system and necessitated costly remedial actions for draining excess liquidity.
These factors facilitated a policy of gradual and careful decrease in interest rates. The current
refinance rate of 25 percent is strongly positive in real terms relative to both the authorities’
and staff’s inflation projections. Nevertheless, the authorities are closely monitoring the
developments and stand ready to tighten monetary policy if inflationary pressures resume or
macroeconomic and financial stability is threatened.
Fiscal policy continues to be disciplined, resulting in a general government budget surplus
of 2.9 percent of GDP in January-March 2013. The central government budget balance also
showed a surplus of 0.7 percent of GDP. The authorities are committed to maintaining a
prudent fiscal stance to ensure a balanced budget in 2013. In line with the overall
stabilization effort of the government, lending under government programs with the use of
public resources has been reduced and remains strictly limited at about 1 percent of GDP
during 2013. The authorities remain committed to continue with this approach to government
support, with the aim to pass the lending under government programs over to the
Development Bank as it builds capacity in the regions while reducing such support to the
minimum. The approach to wages in the budgetary sector continues to be prudent: while the
budget envisions a 7 percent increase in real wages, a major restructuring of the government
is underway, including a reduction of 13,600 civil servant positions at the central and local
levels to be completed by July 1, 2013. As in 2012, there are no plans to recapitalize state
owned banks.
The public debt remains at a sustainable level. As of January 1, 2013, the gross public
debt amounted to 23.8 percent of GDP, of which the external debt accounted for 19 percent
of GDP, far below the national economic security threshold of 45 percent of GDP and the
Maastricht criterion of 60 percent of GDP. The government makes timely debt payments and
has sufficient capacity to honor all its external and domestic obligations. A set of instruments
to refinance the debt is also available. Since the yields on Belarus’ sovereign bonds have
fallen markedly below the pre-crisis level, tapping the international markets remains an
option open to the authorities. Since October 2012, the government has also been active in
issuing foreign exchange denominated bonds in the domestic financial market.
Reform Agenda
Belarus has emerged from the macroeconomic crises of the past years, but these challenges
have reinforced the need for structural reforms to regain competitiveness, diversify and
modernize Belarus’ economic structure, and create sustainable and productive jobs. For

4
Belarus to achieve further growth and social development, it needs to strengthen the
environment to allow its enterprises to dynamically adapt to the demands of an increasingly
competitive global economy.
In order to achieve these goals, the authorities’ priorities are to: (i) enhance economic
efficiency; (ii) increase investment efficiency and facilitate the growth of FDI; (iii) promote
innovations; (iv) increase the GDP share of SMEs; (v) reduce dependence on energy imports
and energy intensity; (vi) provide incentives for productive labor; (vii) increase financial
efficiency and mobilize resources for modernization in the real sector; and (viii) strengthen
the institutional infrastructure to facilitate public/private interface (property rights, efficient
rules, financial intermediation).
Following a fruitful dialogue among key stakeholders including the authorities, business
associations, civil society and development partners, actions to achieve these objectives have
been incorporated into a new World Bank Group Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for
Belarus, which is scheduled for the Bank Board consideration in early June 2013. The
cornerstone of the CPS is to support reforms aimed at improving competitiveness of the
economy by structural transformations, including reducing the size of the government,
transforming the SOE sector, promoting private and financial sector development, and
facilitating integration into the global economy. The CPS contains a combination of financial
support. A wide range of analytical and advisory activities and a comprehensive results
matrix with specific outcomes and milestones has been designed to measure progress.
The authorities reiterate their view that a Fund program focusing on issues within the Fund’s
purview to complement and reinforce reforms could be exceptionally useful.
