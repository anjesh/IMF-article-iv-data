STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2011 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
March 2, 2012

KEY ISSUES
Context: Political reconciliation is gaining traction. The main opposition party, National
League for Democracy will contest the April by-elections; many political prisoners have
been freed; and several ceasefire agreements with ethnic minorities have been signed.
The economic reform momentum is strong. Growth and inflation are expected to
accelerate modestly.
Focus of the consultation: Consistent with past advice, the authorities are moving
forward with reforms of the exchange rate system. Discussions centered on improving
macroeconomic management to underpin these reforms, and on policies to foster
broad-based economic growth.
Key policy issues and recommendations: Priorities are establishing the market
infrastructure for the planned move to a managed float, and monetary and foreign
exchange policy capacity to complement plans to unify the exchange rates. Financial
sector modernization remains essential to support the reform process and improve
financial intermediation. Fiscal policy priorities include ending deficit monetization,
reprioritizing spending, and increasing nonresource revenues for development
spending within a medium-term fiscal framework. Structural reforms should aim to
increase agricultural productivity, and foster private sector development.
Exchange rate arrangement: Myanmar continues to avail itself of transitional
arrangements under Article XIV, although it has eliminated all Article XIV restrictions.
Myanmar maintains exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices subject to
Fund approval under Article VIII. The exchange rate regime is classified as other
managed arrangement.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

INTRODUCTION
1.
Myanmar’s new government faces a
historic opportunity to jump-start
development and lift living standards.
Myanmar could become the next economic
frontier in Asia if, with appropriate reforms, it
can turn its rich natural resources, young labor
force, and proximity to some of the most
dynamic economies, to its advantage.
Delivering on these expectations with inclusive
and sustainable growth should start with
ensuring macroeconomic stability. This process
is already under way with plans to unify the
exchange rate and lift exchange restrictions,
and should be supported by establishing a

consistent monetary policy framework and
improving public financial management.
2.
In the medium term, addressing
long-standing distortions would require
cross-cutting reforms. Modernizing
Myanmar’s economy will be a process of
removing impediments to growth by
enhancing the business and investment
climate, encouraging financial sector
development, and further liberalizing trade
and foreign direct investment (FDI). Economic
development remains essential for reducing
poverty and building human capital.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
3.
Growth has stabilized in FY2010/11.
Driven by higher fiscal spending before the
elections and buoyant commodity exports, real
GDP growth is estimated to have picked up to
5.3 percent in FY2010/11. Inflation declined to
6.4 percent (y-o-y) in October 2011, from
8 percent a year earlier, mainly due to lower
food prices and less deficit monetization.
Gross international reserves rose to an
estimated US$6.1 billion in FY2010/11 (about
nine months of imports) due to natural gas
exports and foreign direct investment (FDI)
inflows primarily into the energy sector.
Staff’s views
4.
The economic outlook is positive.
Real GDP growth is projected at 5½ percent in
FY2011/12 and at 6 percent in FY2012/13
driven by commodity exports and higher
investment, supported by robust credit growth

and improved business confidence. Inflation,
projected at 4.2 percent for FY2011/12, is
expected to pick up to 5.8 percent in
FY2012/13 as the recent drop in food prices
phases out.
5.
Risks to this outlook are balanced.
On the downside, a drop in regional demand
could negatively affect exports, although
Myanmar remains largely insulated from the
developments in advanced economies due to
sanctions. However, a sustained appreciation
of the currency (in the parallel markets used by
the private sector) could further erode external
competitiveness. On the upside, the recent
easing of FDI restrictions, further increase in
credit, and continued progress toward
exchange rate unification could bolster
growth.

Authorities’ views
6.
The authorities concur with staff on
outlook and risks. They have estimated
growth at double digits in the past decade,
relying mostly on the five-year economic plans
for the public sector. They have now initiated a
statistical revision to better reflect private

sector developments that account for about
90 percent of economic activity. They broadly
agreed with staff projections and remain
concerned with the impact of appreciation on
external competitiveness.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS: ESTABLISHING A FRAMEWORK
FOR MACROECONOMIC STABILITY
A. Exchange Rate Unification
7.
The authorities plan to reform their
complex exchange rate system. Since 1977,
an official peg to the SDR at 8.50 kyats per
SDR (5.35 kyats per U.S. dollar) has been in
place. The official rate has never been part of
a monetary policy framework. It is used only
to allocate foreign currency from public
export earnings to public import payments,
and fiscal accounting. An “export-first” policy,
enforced by complex exchange restrictions,
permits private imports to the extent of
available private export earnings, and has
directed all private sector transactions to
parallel markets to obtain foreign currency at
multiple exchange rates in various segmented
markets.1 The exchange restrictions and
multiple currency practices (MPC) are
distortionary, increase transactions costs,
discourage FDI and foreign trade, and are also
exacerbating the exchange rate appreciation
pressures. Since 1993, the Central Bank of
Myanmar (CBM) has also issued U.S. dollarequivalent Foreign Exchange Certificates
(FECs) to limit the circulation of U.S. dollar
1

See Selected Issues Paper, Chapter II.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

banknotes. Over time, the FECs obtained
other functions, including for certain domestic
payments, and are also traded at an informal
market exchange rate.
8.
The combination of strong inflows
and exchange restrictions is eroding
external competitiveness. The parallel
market exchange rate of the kyat has
appreciated by 23 percent in nominal
effective terms and about 29 percent in real
effective terms since end-FY2009/10, driven
by large inflows into the economy, which
cannot find an outlet due to exchange
restrictions on current international payments
and transfers. The official exchange rate is
clearly overvalued, and an analysis based on
the framework of IMF’s Consultative Group on
Exchange Rates suggests that the informal
market exchange rate is on average
19 percent overvalued in FY2010/11 and
40 percent so far in FY2011/12. In
September 2011, the authorities eased some
restrictions to address appreciation pressures
by allowing foreign currency purchases for a
car import program, and health and travel

MYANMAR

expenses abroad from recently established
foreign exchange counters.
9.
The authorities are preparing to
replace the official peg with a managed
float as a first step toward unifying the
exchange rates. They also intend to
announce a redemption plan for the FECs.
Since the most immediate impact of this
change will be on the public sector (the only
user of the official rate), the new fiscal budget
has already incorporated an exchange rate
assumption in line with the prevailing parallel
market exchange rate.
10.
As an integral part of this plan, the
CBM is taking steps to create a formal
foreign exchange market. The initial steps
focused on establishing a formal retail market
by licensing 17 private banks in October 2011
to operate money changing counters at the
Thein Phyu (TP) center. However, restrictions
on TP counters exclude purchases for imports,
besides the one-off car import program. In
November, 11 banks were licensed as
authorized foreign currency dealers (AD) to
trade with each other and domestic
customers; however, these licenses are yet to
be activated. Currently, only three state banks
are allowed to conduct foreign exchange
business with the rest of the world. Private
banks are seeking correspondent banking
relations, beginning with remittance transfers.
Staff’s views
11.
Staff concurs with the authorities’
plan to adopt a managed float wellanchored by necessary market
infrastructure. The fundamental
characteristics of the economy, as well as the
need for exchange rate flexibility during the
unification process point to a managed float,

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

in line with other country experiences.2
Establishing an interbank market to determine
a market-based exchange rate is a
prerequisite for a managed float.3 To this end,
the CBM should establish foreign currency
auctions and a kyat deposit facility to conduct
sterilized foreign currency operations, in line
with recent IMF technical assistance (TA)
recommendations. Activating the AD licenses
should coincide with easing restrictions on
usability of foreign currency for private
imports to facilitate two-way flows between
informal markets and the interbank market.
This should include relaxing restrictions on TP
counters to make these purchases and all
foreign currency accounts at private banks
usable for imports; and further liberalizing
service payments and income transfers
abroad (e.g., education-abroad, royalty
payments).
12.
The CBM should be granted a
standing authorization to use and manage
international reserves. Most of the foreign
assets of Myanmar are held by three state
banks. On current market trends, the CBM is
expected to accumulate reserves at the
foreign currency auctions. Nonetheless, to
provide a reserve cushion, most of the foreign
assets of the state banks should be
transferred to the CBM before the auctions
start. The CBM should adopt international
best practices for reserve management.
13.
The authorities should prepare a
plan to end the ‘export-first’ policy to
accept their Article VIII obligations.
Although the removal of the official exchange
rate and FECs will eliminate two of the many

MYANMAR

exchange rates, the unification of various
informal market exchange rates requires
elimination of the exchange restrictions that
give rise to segmented markets, where these
rates are determined. Ideally, the exchange
restrictions should be removed gradually and
across the board, to provide a level playing
field to all imports and avoid introducing
additional market distortions. This could be
accomplished by exempting a gradually
increasing portion of all private imports from
the requirement to secure private ‘export
earnings’ first, regardless of the source of
foreign currency obtained. This would reduce
market segmentation and help mitigate
appreciation pressures. The plan to lift
exchange rate restrictions should be
coordinated with phasing out of trade
licensing to eliminate nontariff barriers. The
current macroeconomic conditions and
expected FDI inflows provide comfort to start
this process, but also underscore the
importance of maintaining macroeconomic
stability, including by establishing a proper
monetary policy framework and improving
public financial management.

Authorities’ views
14.
The authorities noted broad-based
support and their strong commitment to
exchange rate unification. They emphasized
their priority for stability during the
unification process. Accordingly, they planned
ahead to assess the impact of the move to a
managed float on the state economic
enterprises (SEEs) and the fiscal budget. For
the unification of informal market rates used
by the private sector, they expect to have a
plan ready by mid-2012 to gradually lift all
remaining restrictions on current international
payments and transfers. They target to
complete the process before end-2013, when
the South East Asian Games will be held in
Myanmar. They began drafting a new foreign
exchange law and welcomed the planned IMF
TA in March to finalize the draft. They noted
immediate plans to activate the AD licenses,
and have relaxed the restrictions on TP
counters. They plan to launch foreign
currency auctions and interbank trading at the
time of the announcement of the managed
float.

B. Establishing a Monetary Policy Framework
15.
The CBM does not have a monetary
policy framework. The official peg was never
used as a monetary anchor. Interest rates for
all instruments are set administratively. The
CBM is a department within the Ministry of
Finance and Revenue (MoFR), with the
primary function of monetizing the fiscal
deficits. There is a nascent over-the-counter
market for treasury securities, albeit at
administratively-set rates. There is no formal
interbank market, and the CBM does not
conduct any monetary operations. Pervasive

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

controls on banks impede the monetary
transmission mechanism.
16.
First interest cuts since 2007 made
treasury bonds more attractive. Since
September 2011, the deposit and lending
rates were cut by a cumulative 4 percentage
points to 8 and 13 percent, respectively. The
September adjustment also placed the
treasury bond rates above the minimum
deposit rate, which provides an incentive for
banks to hold treasury bonds, and helped
reduce deficit monetization. The CBM also

allowed banks some flexibility in setting the
deposits rates within a band.

Staff’s views
17.
A consistent monetary policy
framework is a necessary complement to
reforms of the exchange rate regime. The
CBM should be given full operational
autonomy and proper accountability, with the
clearly defined primary objective of domestic
price stability. All central banking functions,
including treasury agency and reserve
management functions currently held by state
banks, should be moved to the CBM.
Consistent with the heavily cash-based nature
of the economy, and its close link with
inflation, the CBM should start monitoring
reserve money to guide its future interest rate
decisions. While planned deposit auctions
would provide an interim tool to manage
liquidity, developing the treasury securities
market is needed to move to market-based
monetary operations.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

structural impediments on private sector,
further interest rate cuts risk channeling
domestic savings to potentially speculative
assets, such as real estate. The onus of
stimulating productive investment is now on
structural policies to reduce barriers for
private sector development.
Authorities’ views
19.
The authorities plan to grant the
CBM operational autonomy. The CBM is in
the process of drafting a new central bank
law, and welcomed the planned IMF TA in
March to benefit from international best
practices. The authorities anticipate that the
law will be adopted in 2012. They also plan to
consolidate reserve management at the CBM
before they announce the float, however, they
saw transferring all treasury functions to the
CBM as part of a broader reorganization of
state banks that would take time and require
TA. They noted capacity constraints in
establishing a reserve money targeting
framework and monetary operations and
considered TA essential.
20.
The authorities agreed with staff
that the current level of interest rates is
appropriate. They noted that the interest rate
adjustment in September 2011 has increased
bank purchases of treasury bonds
substantially since then, but saw little room
for further rate cuts in the near term.

18.
The level of interest rates appears
appropriate in light of the economic
outlook. Within the current regulatory
constraints on financial intermediation and

C. Fiscal Management: Supporting Development and Ensuring
Sustainability
21.
The fiscal deficit in FY2011/12 has
narrowed due to lower capital spending
after the elections. With the construction of
the new capital close to completion and
moderation in defense spending after the
elections, the deficit is expected to moderate
to 5½ percent in FY2011/12, despite the recent
increase in pensions and a temporary tax
exemption on key agricultural exports to
address deteriorating external
competitiveness.
22.
The adoption of a market-based
exchange rate is expected to further reduce
the budget deficit in FY2012/13. As a net
exporter, the consolidated public sector
budget is expected to benefit from the use of
the market exchange rate by 1.2 percent of
GDP.4 This is primarily due to the net transfers
from SEEs, notwithstanding the planned
increase in social and infrastructure spending,
reducing the projected deficit to a 4.6 percent
of GDP.
23.
Despite progress in bond financing,
deficit monetization remains the main
financing tool. Bond financing is estimated to
reach 46 percent of the deficit in FY2011/12
helped by the recent adjustment in interest
rates. However, weak public financial
management leads to automatic monetization
of the residual by the CBM. The planned fiscal
decentralization could further undermine fiscal
discipline. In particular, weak budgeting
capacity, the separation of sub-national
budgets from the State Fund Account (treasury
4

8

See Selected Issues Paper, Chapter V.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

account) and their interim financing by the
Myanma Economic Bank, which handles the
treasury functions, could increase deficit
monetization.
Staff’s views
24.
Stopping deficit monetization
remains essential to contain inflation
pressures. Lifting restrictions on state banks’
and Myanmar Insurance’s holdings of
government securities; and encouraging retail
sales of treasury bonds would further increase
bond financing. Moving to treasury bond
auctions would help phase out deficit
monetization and establish a marketdetermined interest rate. Establishing a
treasury function within the MoFR is essential
to strengthen public financial management
and will require technical assistance. With
planned decentralization, institutional
arrangements to delineate fiscal
responsibilities and improving regional
capacity for fiscal management are also
necessary.
25.
The first budget discussion in the
new parliament provides a historic
opportunity to redefine fiscal priorities.
Although the lower deficit target is
appropriate, there is substantial room within
the current budget envelope to focus fiscal
policies on poverty reduction, and building
human capital and infrastructure. Plans to shift
spending to health and education could go
further and should aim at narrowing large
regional differences in social outcomes. Capital
spending should support rural development

MYANMAR

and power generation, and be centered on
result-based planning and evaluation.
26.
Expanding tax bases would generate
more revenues for development spending.
Replacing the commercial tax with a general
sales tax with a single tax rate, and at most one
reduced (or zero) tax rate for basic food items,
would be a first step to simplify tax structures,
while raising the exemption threshold for
income tax would make it easier to administer.
27.
In light of increasing reliance on
natural resource-based revenues, a broadly
balanced medium-term budget appears
appropriate. Under current policies, the deficit
is expected to decline to around 1¼ percent in
the medium term, primarily due to a
substantial increase in gas revenues in mid2013. This is appropriate in light of the large
development needs of the current generations.
However, these resource-based revenues
should be used to increase Myanmar’s growth
potential by building infrastructure and human
capital.

28.
The adoption of a managed float
would increase transparency of SEEs’
performance and should guide their reform.
This would reveal the implicit losses of
importing SEEs, which were previously hidden
by the use of the official exchange rate.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Initially, these implicit subsidies should be
replaced with explicit subsidies to all lossmaking SEEs in the budget to prevent
accumulation of domestic arrears and avoid
sharp price adjustments, especially for public
utilities. Going forward, any price adjustments
should begin with gradual reduction in
regressive subsides to protect the poor.
Authorities’ Views
29.
The authorities’ target a deficit in
the range of 4½ percent of GDP in
FY2012/13 with more emphasis on social
spending. They plan to reduce military
spending to 14½ percent of total expenditures
from 23½ percent, while social spending is
expected to increase to about 7½ percent of
expenditures, from 5.4 percent. They also plan
to allocate more spending to transportation
infrastructure. They await the new national
economic plan to guide their medium-term
fiscal targets, which is expected to allocate
future gas revenues to poverty reduction, rural
development, and industrialization.
30.
The authorities recognize the need
to improve tax policies and tax
administration. In August 2011, they
abolished the withholding tax on imports, and
are considering simplifying soon the
commercial tax on domestic sales, which
contains more than nine tax rates. They also
plan to introduce single tax payer
identification and self-assessments to expand
the tax bases, but expect that this would take
time and would require broader tax education
and improved tax administration.
31.
The authorities are planning further
privatization of SEEs. They noted progress in
privatizing more than 700 SEEs since the late
1990s. To increase transparency and improve

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

9

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

MYANMAR

valuations, they plan to move to open tenders
in FY2012/13, but expect slower privatization
as most of the profitable SEEs have already
been privatized. They also plan to liberalize
SEE operations by allowing them to manage

their costs of raw materials from their
operating revenues, rather than through
budgetary allocations, but will continue to
cover their losses, including those emanating
from the adoption of a managed float.

D. Financial Sector Policies: Facilitating Development
32.
The financial sector is small and
repressed with administrative controls on
financial intermediation.5 Key obstacles are
the deposit-to-capital ratio,6 onerous collateral
requirements, administratively set interest
rates, and segmented banking activities. These
controls and the exchange restrictions led to a
reportedly large unregulated shadow financial
system. The regulatory treatment of state
banks and private banks is uneven, bank
governance is poor, and banking supervision
does not follow the Basel Core Principles.
There is no unified national electronic
payments and settlement system, although
plans are under way to develop the financial
infrastructure.
33.
Recently, the authorities eased some
restrictions on the financial sector. Since
March 2011, more than 40 new bank branches
were allowed and the list of acceptable
collateral was further expanded. These steps
improved access to credit and led to
acceleration in private sector credit growth,
albeit from a very low base.

development and prepare the sector for the
ASEAN Economic Community. While gradual
liberalization of loan interest rates, as with
deposit rates, should begin in tandem with
reforms to the monetary policy framework,
broader efforts are needed to improve
financial intermediation. These include phasing
out the deposit-to-capital ratio while
strengthening capital requirements, further
expanding the list of acceptable collateral, and
easing administrative requirements on
expanding branch networks. Joint ventures
with foreign financial institutions would
expedite the transfer of technology before the
ASEAN financial integration in 2015.
35.
Financial liberalization should be
complemented with a stronger regulatory
and supervisory framework. While there is a
broad need to upgrade regulation and
supervision, concurrent with financial
liberalization the priority should be given to
moving to internationally accepted definitions
for loan classification and provisioning,
strengthening conflict-of-interest
requirements, and introducing a net open
foreign currency position limit. Efforts to
strengthen the AML/CFT regime should be
guided by the action plan agreed with the
Financial Action Task Force.

MYANMAR

Authorities’ views
36.
The authorities broadly concurred
with staff positions, but also noted capacity
constraints. They noted limited human
capacity at private banks as a constraint on
branch expansions. They preferred a gradual
liberalization indicating that many domestic
banks are not ready for price competition,

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

notwithstanding the need to prepare for
ASEAN integration. Regarding state banks,
they noted that it would take time to wean
them off of their historic roles in carrying out
many administrative functions of the state.
Nonetheless, they noted plans to revise the
financial institutions’ law to modernize the
sector.

E. Structural Policies: Lifting Impediments to Broad-based Growth
37.
Growth is narrow-based. The
economy largely depends on energy and
agriculture. Agricultural development is
suppressed by poor access to credit, lack of
private land ownership, and inadequate
infrastructure and inputs. The energy sector
has surpassed agriculture as the main source
of export revenues. However, its growth
dividend is limited, as it is exclusively under
state control and is largely isolated from the
domestic economy. Despite the low wage
advantage, the manufacturing sector remains
stifled by poor infrastructure, inadequate
know-how, and extensive administrative
constraints. Myanmar has one of the highest
costs in the world for starting a business.

land ownership, which they expect to begin in
2012.

38.
There is momentum to promote
rural growth and increase competition. The
authorities doubled the size of harvest loans to
farmers in 2011, while specialized rice
companies have provided additional credit in
certain areas. In January 2012, they also
allowed agricultural land to be leased for up to
60 years to facilitate FDI. The recent
liberalization of private imports of gasoline
and palm oil helped reduce rationing and
improved price competition. They are also
considering a new land reform to grant private

40.
Recent efforts to support private
sector development are welcome and
should go further. The positive examples of
gasoline and palm oil imports can easily be
multiplied by moving away from
nontransparent licensing practices that limit
competition. Replicating the success of FDI in
the energy sector in other sectors would help
diversify the economy consistent with the
authorities’ plans to move toward
industrialization. In this regard, the elimination
of exchange restrictions is essential, besides
gradually moving to a negative list for

Staff’s Views
39.
Lifting agricultural productivity
remains essential for rural development.
Investment in productivity improvements
requires long-term credit. The planned land
reform provides a unique opportunity to grant
land titles that can be used as collateral for
borrowing, a key impediment for private bank
lending to agriculture. Higher rates of broadbased rural growth are essential to reduce
poverty, and require complementary public
investment in roads, education, and health.

restricted FDI. However, the broader goal of
promoting private sector development would
require stronger efforts to improve the
business climate by reducing administrative
controls and the cost of doing business.
Authorities’ Views
41.
The authorities consider rural
development essential for inclusive growth.
They plan to further double harvest loans to
farmers in 2012 and are considering jointly
with the private sector to establish a rice
purchase program to stabilize farm gate prices.

They expect the planned land reform to
facilitate productivity enhancements, including
mechanization and use of improved inputs.
42.
Industrialization is part of the
authorities’ new national economic plan.
They target eliminating infrastructure
bottlenecks, beginning with energy. To this
end, they have opened up onshore exploration
to international companies. They consider
specialized economic zones as a focal point to
attract FDI to focus on labor-intensive
industries and view reforms of the exchange
regime essential to facilitate this process.

F. Other Issues
Staff’s Views

Authorities’ Views

43.
Capacity building is essential to
improve data quality and coverage. Data
remain grossly inadequate for surveillance due
to capacity constraints and inadequate
resources. Substantial TA is necessary to
support the authorities’ plans to upgrade their
statistical practices.

45.
The authorities included improving
data quality as a priority in their new
national economic plan. They plan to
overhaul their statistical practices to eliminate
the heritage of the past and see a great need
for capacity building.

44.
Resolving external arrears would
bolster the government’s engagement with
the international community. The recent
reconciliation of Myanmar’s outstanding
obligations to Japan is a welcome first step
and should be extended to all creditors.
Myanmar remains in debt distress, primarily
due to arrears, notwithstanding the
improvement in debt indicators.7

46.
The authorities consider access to
new funding essential to normalize arrears.
They plan to extend the reconciliation exercise
to all creditors, but noted the vast
development needs as a constraint on payment
capacity.

STAFF APPRAISAL
47.
The new government has started the
process of addressing Myanmar’s
development challenges. Unleashing
Myanmar’s high growth potential will require
cross-cutting reforms and substantial technical
assistance, both beginning with improvements
to macroeconomic management. The
authorities’ top priority to reform the exchange
rate system is well-placed and should be
complemented by strengthening monetary
and fiscal management to bolster the positive
effects of planned exchange rate unification. In
the medium term, modernizing the economy
will be a process of removing impediments to
growth by enhancing the business and
investment climate, promoting agricultural
productivity, modernizing the financial sector,
and further liberalizing trade and FDI. Building
human capital and poverty reduction are
essential to benefit from these reforms.
48.
The economic outlook is positive.
Real GDP growth is expected to increase to
5½ percent in FY2011/12 and to 6 percent in
FY2012/13, driven by commodity exports and
higher investment. Inflation, projected at
4.2 percent for FY2011/12, is expected to rise
to 5.8 percent in FY2012/13 as the recent
decline in food prices phases out. Risks to this
outlook are broadly balanced.
49.
The planned adoption of a managed
float is a welcome first step toward
exchange rate unification. Steps to establish
the necessary market infrastructure in line with
IMF TA recommendations should continue,
and require expeditious removal of some
exchange restrictions to make a larger pool of
foreign currency available for private imports
and other transfers abroad.

50.
The unification of the informal
market exchange rates would require
moving away from the ‘export-first’ policy.
The authorities should prepare a plan to
gradually remove all exchange restrictions on
current international payments and transfers,
and eliminate multiple currency practices
(MPCs) by a target date. Pending such a plan,
staff does not recommend the approval of the
existing exchange restrictions and MPCs.
51.
A monetary framework is a
necessary complement to reforms of the
exchange rate system. Plans to grant the
CBM operational autonomy is a positive first
step, and should include transferring all central
banking functions from state banks to the
CBM, and starting reserve money targeting.
While the recent reduction in interest rates is
welcome, there is no room for further interest
rate cuts in light of economic outlook.
52.
Further progress in reducing deficit
monetization is needed to contain inflation
pressures. Until treasury bond auctions can be
established, expanding the retail sales of
treasury bonds and lifting restrictions on state
banks’ and insurance company’s holdings of
treasury securities would further reduce deficit
monetization. A treasury function is essential
to improve public financial management, as
well as better institutional arrangements to
delineate fiscal responsibilities under fiscal
decentralization.
53.
The new government’s first budget
aims at redefining national spending
priorities. Plans to increase social spending,
while targeting a moderate fiscal deficit of
4½ percent of GDP in FY2012/13, are

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

MYANMAR

welcome, but there is further room to prioritize
spending for poverty reduction and education.
54.
In the medium term, a broadly
balanced budget is appropriate. Increasing
gas revenues should be used to expand
Myanmar’s growth potential by building
human capital and infrastructure. More
development spending would require lifting
nonresource revenues by expanding tax bases
through simplifying taxes and improving tax
administration.
55.
Reforms of SEEs should continue
with improved transparency. The SEE losses
that would be revealed with the adoption of a
market-determined exchange rate should
guide future SEE reforms. While explicit
subsidies would avoid fast price hikes of
utilities and essential inputs, a gradual
reduction in regressive subsidies, which tend
to benefit higher income groups, would
contain their losses.
56.
Financial sector modernization
remains essential to facilitate development.
Gradual liberalization of interest rates that
began with deposit rates should be extended
to loans, commissions, and fees. The recent
efforts to improve financial intermediation
should continue by lifting pervasive
administrative controls on network expansions,
phasing out the deposit-to-capital ratio, and

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

expanding the list of allowable collateral.
Liberalization should be complemented by
strengthened supervision and regulation. Joint
ventures with foreign banks would help
prepare the sector for ASEAN financial
integration in 2015.
57.
Private sector development requires
stronger efforts to improve the business
climate. Eliminating nontransparent licensing
practices and administrative controls would
help provide a level playing field and reduce
the cost of doing business. Gradually moving
to a negative list for restricted FDI would
reduce investor uncertainty.
58.
Data remains grossly inadequate for
surveillance. Substantial capacity building
efforts are needed to improve coverage and
quality of data.
59.
Resolving eternal arrears is essential
to re-engage the international community.
Recent efforts to reconcile arrears with Japan
are welcome and should be extended to all
creditors.
60.
It is recommended that the next Article
IV consultation be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

1/ The official exchange rate is assumed to be abolished with the adoption of a market-based exchange rate in FY2012/13.

includes current expenditure of Union government and SEEs, net of net SEEs transfers to the union budget.
3/ Converted at the official exchange rate before FY2012/13, when the official exchange rate is replaced by a market-determined exchange rate.

6/ From FY2011/12, other nontax revenue include certain local development councils (e.g., Yangon, Mandalay, etc), which were not included earlier.
7/ Includes current expenditures of the Ministry of Defense and pension and gratuities.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2011 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS1

March 2, 2012

Approved By

Masato Miyazaki and
Dhaneshwar Ghura (IMF)

Prepared By
International Monetary Fund

Although the debt indicators show a moderate risk of debt distress based on a forwardlooking analysis, the presence of substantial arrears and uncertainty about timing and
modality of their resolution pose substantial risks to the debt outlook. Thus, Myanmar
remains classified as in debt distress.2 The projected path of Myanmar’s external and
public debt burden indicators improves significantly in the medium and long term
compared to last year’s DSA, primarily due to increasing fiscal revenues with the planned
adoption of a market-determined exchange rate and a better outlook for the economy.
While external debt burden indicators do not breach the relevant indicative thresholds
under the baseline scenario, the debt level is sensitive to shocks such as shortfalls in
exports as indicated in standard bound tests. Myanmar’s overall public sector debt
indicators are high in the short term, but are expected to show a decreasing trend over
the longer term. Under an alternative scenario with a fixed higher primary deficit or
permanently lower growth over the medium and long term, Myanmar’s public debt
sustainability would deteriorate. These vulnerabilities underscore the importance of
sound macroeconomic policies to improve Myanmar’s growth potential on a sustained
basis, including by strengthening public financial management and export diversification.

This DSA has been prepared by IMF staff only, since IDA has suspended its financial relationship with
Myanmar due to arrears.
1

External public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) debt and public domestic debt dynamics are assessed using
the Low-Income Country Debt Sustainability Analysis (LIC-DSA) framework, which recognizes that better
policies and institutions allow countries to manage higher levels of debt, and thus the threshold levels are
policy-dependent. The quality of a country’s policies and institutions are normally measured by the World
Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA). Since Myanmar does not currently have a CPIA
rating, the most conservative thresholds are applied for the purposes of this DSA. The thresholds, which apply
to external PPG debt, are: 30 percent for the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio, 100 percent for the NPV of debt-toexports ratio, 200 percent for the NPV of debt-to-revenue ratio, 15 percent for the debt service-to-exports
ratio, and 25 percent for the debt service-to-revenue ratio.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS MYANMAR

BACKGROUND
1.
The external and public debt
sustainability analyses are based on the
standard LIC DSA framework. The DSA
framework presents the projected path of
Myanmar’s external and public sector debt
burden indicators, and draws some conclusions
on the forward-looking sustainability of debt.
2.
Myanmar’s DSA builds on the baseline
scenario assumptions presented in Box 1.
Compared to last year’s DSA (2010) baseline
macroeconomic scenario, the economic outlook
under the baseline has improved due to planned
economic reforms and improved business
confidence (Box 1). In particular, the current DSA
assumes going forward that the planned
adoption of a market-based exchange rate would
result in a smaller fiscal deficit in the medium
term, and broadly balanced budget in the long
term as opposed to a deficit of 3½ percent of
GDP in the previous DSA.
3.
Myanmar’s total public sector debt
stock is high at over 45 percent of GDP. Total
public debt is estimated at 47½ percent of GDP in
2010—of which more than half was foreign
currency denominated (Table 1a)—slightly lower
from 48½ percent of GDP in 2009. However, the
outlook on debt indicators improved primarily
owing to projected smaller deficits and robust real
GDP growth.
4.
Accelerating economic growth and
real exchange rate appreciation have
contributed to a decline in debt ratios over the
past years. At the end of 2010, Myanmar’s
external public and publicly guaranteed (PPG)
debt stock was 24½ percent of GDP in nominal
terms and 17¾ percent in net present value (NPV)

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

terms. For 2011, the debt stock in PV terms as a
share of GDP, as a share of exports of goods and
nonfactor services, and of government revenues is
projected to further decline to 15½ percent,
77½ percent and 138½ percent, respectively.
Myanmar’s net nonconcessional new borrowings
started to increase from FY2008/09, reaching
5 percent of total external debt in FY2010/11.
China is the largest emerging creditor accounting
for about 30 percent of the net increase in
nonconcessional loans in 2010.

MYANMAR 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

Box 1. Myanmar: Key Macroeconomic Assumptions Underlying the DSA for the Baseline
Scenario (2011–31)


Real GDP growth is assumed at 6 percent, driven
by commodity exports and higher investment
supported by robust credit growth and improved
business confidence.



Inflation, projected on average at 5.5 percent y/y
in the medium term, is expected to continue
trending down and stabilize around 3.5 percent in
the long term. This is based on the assumption of
smaller fiscal deficits and substituting deficit
monetization with bond financing.



The overall fiscal deficit in terms of GDP is
expected to narrow from about 5½ percent in
2011 to 1¼ percent in 2017, before gradually
reaching a broadly balanced budget by 2031.
Revenue would be the main driver of
consolidation and is expected to rise to over
20 percent of GDP in the medium term owing to
the positive budgetary impact of exchange rate
unification and substantial increase in gas export
revenues with the completion of Shwe and Zawtika
projects. Revenue is expected to stay over
19½ percent of GDP over the long term, implying
modest improvement in non-resource based tax
revenues. Compared with previous DSAs, revenue,
defined as consolidated nonfinancial public sector
revenue, is revised to reflect the non-zero balance
of SEEs and include all revenue receipts of SEEs
instead of only net SEE transfers. Correspondingly,
consolidated current expenditure includes current
expenditure of union government and SEEs after
netting out the net transfers to the union budget.
Public expenditure would remain mostly at
around 20 percent through the medium term, and
be kept below 19½ percent up to 2031.



The growth of exports averages around 9 percent,
in the medium term reflecting new natural gas
projects coming on stream. Over the longer term,
export growth remains robust, averaging around
11 percent, driven by export diversification beyond
commodity exports supported by higher
investment, including foreign direct investment.



The growth of imports averages around
10¼ percent in the medium term given the
authorities’ plan to gradually remove exchange
restrictions on current international payments and

transfers. Over the longer term, import growth
would stay around 10 percent, reflecting the need
for imported capital goods to support
development.



The current account (including official transfers),
which in 2011 was in deficit, is expected to remain
in deficit over the medium and longer term.



As of end-FY2010/11, around 20 percent of public
domestic debt is in the form of treasury bonds,
with the rest in the form of treasury bills (bearing a
nominal interest rate of 4 percent). Treasury bonds
are issued in maturities of two, three, and five years,
bearing nominal interest at rates of 8.75, 9, and
9.5 percent, respectively. Average real interest
rates on domestic public debt was negative in 2010
due to rising inflation and fixed low nominal
interest rates on treasury bills, the majority of debt.
However, they turned positive in 2011 due to
subsiding inflation and increasing share of deficit
financing through higher interest-paying treasury
bonds. They are projected to remain positive in the
medium and longer term in line with government’s
plan to totally shift toward bond financing of the
deficit.



The new financing needs are assumed to be met in
half by foreign exchange debt with the remainder
financed by domestic medium and long-term debt.
The new external debt is assumed to be 20 year
loans with five-year grace period and 4 percent
interest rate in line with recent actual borrowing.
Average maturity of three years is assumed for new
domestic borrowings.



Arrears to foreign creditors constitute a significant
part of the stock of foreign debt (Table 3). Given the
very early stage of reconciling arrears with creditors,
the DSA, as in the past, assumes no rescheduling of
arrears or resumption on repayments. For similar
reasons, aid flows are also assumed to remain at
their current levels. Given the suspension of
financial relationship between Myanmar and its
Paris Club and multilateral creditors, debt numbers
reported by authorities may be lower than the
numbers on creditors’ books, which imposes an
upside risk on Myanmar’s debt burden indicators.

debt.3 About 80 percent of external debt in arrears is
owed to bilateral creditors with the remainder split
between multilateral and private creditors

(Table 3). Recently, the authorities began the
reconciliation of their arrears number with Japan and
expect to extend this process to other creditors.

EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
6.
All external debt indicators remain
below the debt burden thresholds under the
baseline scenario, and are expected to decline
further over the projection period (Figure 1 and
Table 1a). During the projection period, the PV of
the debt-to-GDP ratio decreases from about
16 percent in 2011 to about 6 percent in 2031
(compared to an indicative threshold3of
30 percent), while the PV of the debt-to-exports
ratio decreases from about 78 percent in 2011 to
about 24 percent in 2031 (compared to an
indicative threshold of 100 percent). The PV of
the-debt-to-revenue ratio declines from about
139 percent in 2011 to about 32 percent in 2031
(indicative threshold: 200 percent). The debt
service-to-exports and debt service-to-revenue

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ratios stay below the indicative thresholds
throughout the entire projection period despite
the projected high debt service burden during
2011–21.
7.
The standard stress tests do not reveal
any significant vulnerability with the exception
of NPV of debt-to-exports ratio (Figure 1 and
Table 2b). A one-standard-deviation shortfall in
export growth in 2012–13 compared with
historical average would push the NPV of debtto-exports ratio to 109 percent, highlighting the
need for export diversification and addressing
structural impediments to external
competitiveness.

MYANMAR 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
8.
The nominal debt stock would increase
modestly to 47.9 percent of GDP (42½ percent
of GDP in NPV terms) by end-2012 before it
declines steadily thereafter. This reflects the
smaller fiscal deficits and better economic outlook
envisaged under the baseline over the medium
term (Table 2a). The PV of public debt-to-GDP
ratio and the PV of public debt-to-revenue ratio
would decline gradually over the long term to
12½ percent and 64¼ percent, respectively. The
debt service-to-revenue ratio remains low for the

entire projection period and will reach 3¼ percent
by 2031 under the baseline.
9.
Stress tests indicate that vulnerabilities
remain throughout the projection period.
Under a permanent growth shock, the level of
public debt (as a share of GDP) stays high and
would be at 43 percent of GDP (in PV terms) in
2031. If the primary balance remains unchanged
at its 2011 level, the PV of public debt-to-GDP
continues to rise to 71 percent by 2031 (Table 2b).

STAFF ASSESSMENT
10.
Although the debt indicators show a
moderate risk of debt distress based on a
forward-looking analysis, the presence of
substantial arrears and uncertainty about their
resolution pose substantial risks to the debt
outlook. Compared to last year’s DSA, the
projected paths of external and public debt
burden indicators improve significantly over the
medium and long term owing to the projected
smaller fiscal deficits due to increasing gas
revenues with the use of a market-determined
exchange rate in budgetary operations,4 and a
better economic outlook. In previous DSAs, the
former impact could not be captured due to the
absence of any credible plans to unify the
exchange rate. Notwithstanding the improvement
in debt indicators, the presence of arrears and
uncertainty about the timing and modality of their
resolution indicate debt distress. Thus, Myanmar
remains classified as in debt distress.

11.
The baseline projections and the
associated standard stress tests show
moderate risk related to external debt. Only
one of the indicators would breach the indicative
debt burden thresholds under stress tests.
However, there is great need for sound
macroeconomic policies, including in public fiscal
management, to safeguard fiscal sustainability,
and to improve Myanmar’s growth potential and
increase export diversification to manage risks to
external debt sustainability. External arrears
constitute a large portion of external PPG debt,
and it will be important for the authorities to
resolve them to improve the overall debt profile.
12.
The improving debt indicators depend
on increasing revenues from nonrenewable
natural resources. Maintaining the primary
balance at its 2011 level would put public debt
sustainability under significant risk. This
underscores the importance of reducing reliance
on nonrenewable revenue sources by improved
tax policies and public financial management.

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline, while grace and maturity periods are the same as
in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level
after the shock (implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Exchange Rate Arrangement

Joined on January 3, 1952; Article XIV.

The kyat has been pegged to the SDR at
K 8.5057 per SDR since May 2, 1977. Myanmar
applies margins of 2 percent in respect of spot
exchange transactions. In February 1993, the
Central Bank of Myanmar (CBM) started
issuing foreign exchange certificates (FEC) at a
rate of 1 FEC=US$1. In December 1995, the
authorities established FEC exchange centers
where the FEC could be traded at K 450 per
FEC, but also allowed the FEC to be traded in
parallel markets. The FEC counters were closed
in April 2010, and in September 2011, FEC
transactions close to market rates were
allowed at the recently allowed retail counters
at the Thein Phyu center.

Myanmar continues to avail itself of
transitional arrangements under Article XIV,
although it has eliminated all Article XIV
restrictions. Myanmar maintains exchange
restrictions and multiple currency practices
subject to Fund approval under Article VIII.
Exchange restrictions subject to Fund
jurisdiction arise from (i) advance import
deposit requirements; (ii) 100 percent margin
requirements; (iii) general restrictions on the
availability and use of foreign exchange as
such; (iv) general restrictions on the making of
payments and transfers related to invisibles;
(v) the extra burden caused by official action
imposing additional costs for exchange
transactions; (vi) official action that gives rise
to multiple effective exchange rates in the
markets (as well as potential deviations absent
a mechanism to prevent spreads) with respect
to the official exchange rate as compared to

authorities’ plans to unify the exchange rate
and lift exchange restrictions toward
accepting their Article VIII obligations,

ANNEX III. WORLD BANK-IMF COLLABORATION
(January 2012)
The Fund and the Bank country teams for
Myanmar, led by Ms. Karasulu (IMF) and by
Ms. Dixon (World Bank), maintain excellent
working relations and dialogue on
macroeconomic and structural issues.
The level of cooperation and coordination
is excellent but limited, given the relatively
limited activities of both institutions in
Myanmar, especially the World Bank (WB).
Myanmar is in arrears to the WB, which limits
the WB’s level of engagement in the country.
The WB selectively provides support to donors
in implementing activities including during the
IMF’s annual Article IV consultations. The staff
routinely shares country documents prepared
by the respective institutions for their
respective Executive Boards.
Recent key areas of cooperation and
coordination include:

Macroeconomic policy advice to the
authorities. Representatives from the WB
participate as active members of the team in
every IMF Article IV mission to Myanmar. In
this context, staffs from both institutions
discuss macroeconomic policies and the main
messages to the authorities.

Structural reforms. Fund and WB
teams have worked together and have shared
views on a range of other issues, including
structural reforms for a better investment
climate and private sector development, and
social development. World Bank staff actively

contribute to the work of IMF Article IV
missions through notes on important
structural issues that are incorporated in the
IMF staff reports.
Based on the above partnership, the WB
and the Fund share a common view about
Myanmar’s macroeconomic and structural
reform priorities. Important reform priorities
include:

Unifying the exchange rate. The
authorities are preparing to adopt a managed
float in FY2012/13, as an initial step in the
process toward exchange rate unification. Staff
has urged the authorities to continue
liberalizing the trade regime, which is a key
component of the exchange rate unification
process, and prepare a plan to gradually lift all
remaining restrictions on current international
payments and transfers by a target date.

Promoting long-term growth and
diversification. Modernizing Myanmar’s
economy will require removing impediments
to growth by enhancing business and
investment climate, encouraging financial
sector development, and further liberalizing
trade and foreign direct investment (FDI). The
new government’s recent efforts go in the
right direction and would benefit from
coordination across government agencies,
broader consultation with stakeholders, and
using best international practices distilled from
other countries’ experiences through
substantial capacity building efforts.


Monetary policy and deficit
financing. The recent adjustments of the fixed
interest rate structure have appropriately
placed deposit rates below Treasury bond
rates, helping reduce projected deficit
monetization. Pending the introduction of
treasury bond auctions to fully bond finance
the deficit, expanding retail sales of treasury
bonds, and lifting restrictions on state banks’
and insurance companies’ bond holding would
be essential to reduce deficit monetization.

Further liberalization of financial
intermediation and strengthening
regulatory and supervisory framework.
Allowing the expansion of private bank branch
networks and further expanding the list of
collateral are welcome steps that have
improved access to credit. However,
expediting the removal of administrative
controls on financial intermediation remains
essential to facilitate growth. Liberalization of
the financial sector should be complemented
with a stronger regulatory and supervisory
framework to maintain financial stability.

Fiscal discipline and transparency.
Prudent fiscal policy is essential to maintain

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

macroeconomic stability, especially during the
transition to a unified exchange rate. Staff
emphasizes an urgent need to improve the
quality, timeliness, and transparency of
government financial statistics, including those
of the state economic enterprises (SEEs).
Strengthening pubic financial management,
including by establishing a treasury function,
and defining institutional arrangements to
delineate fiscal responsibilities under planned
decentralization, are essential to safeguard
financial discipline.

Prioritizing fiscal policies toward
social and infrastructure spending. Staff
welcomes the authorities’ plans to shift some
spending to health and education in the first
budget of the new government, but sees
further room to reorient spending to social
spending.
The teams are committed to continue their
close cooperation going forward. The table
below details the specific activities planned by
the two country teams over the period
February 2012–January 2013.

ANNEX IV. MYANMAR: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD
BANK GROUP1
(January 2012)
Myanmar became a member of the World
Bank in 1952, IFC in 1956, and IDA in 1962.
During the period 1956–61, the Bank made
three loans totaling US$33.3 million in the
transport sector. No lending was requested
during 1962–73. Lending resumed in 1973 and
over the period 1973–87, 30 IDA credits
totaling some US$804 million equivalent were
committed, of which US$752.8 million
equivalent was disbursed. New lending ceased
after 1987 due to a lack of dialogue on policy
reform. The last formal Consultative Group
meeting was held in January 1986 in Tokyo,
chaired by the Bank. Since then, there have
been occasional contacts between the
government and the Bank on the sidelines of
the Annual Meetings..1
Myanmar went into arrears with the Bank in
January 1998 and has been in nonaccrual
status since September 1998. As of
January 2012, Myanmar's obligation to IDA
was US$782.8 million, of which US$391 million
was in arrears.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

The Bank’s engagement in past years has been
limited to monitoring economic and social
developments in the country based on
available information and reports, liaising with
other international donors and agencies,
continued participation in IMF Article IV
missions, and providing support to the work of
other donors in selected areas.
As part of its monitoring and updating of
information, the Bank has continued to
participate in IMF Article IV missions. Support
to partners has included an avian influenza
project implemented by FAO, and the
provision of technical expertise to ASEAN
following Cyclone Nargis in 2008 for damage
assessment and recovery planning. Following
on this work, the Bank has provided technical
support for impact monitoring to the multidonor livelihoods trust fund (LIFT). The Bank
expects to expand its support to donors in
Myanmar through further analytical work in
the coming months.

ANNEX V. MYANMAR: RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN
DEVELOPMENT BANK1
(February 2012)
Myanmar joined the Asian Development Bank
(AsDB) in 1973 and operations started the
same year. The AsDB has so far provided
32 loans totaling US$530.9 million for
28 projects. Of these, two loans amounting to
US$6.6 million were from the AsDB’s ordinary
capital resources (OCR), and 30 loans
amounting to US$524.3 million were from its
special funds resources. All of the loans to
Myanmar have been closed. The AsDB has so
far provided technical assistance (TA) totaling
US$10.7 million for 38 projects. Of these 38 TA
projects, 28 were project preparatory and 10
were advisory.1
The last loan and TA projects for Myanmar
were approved in 1986 and 1987, respectively.
However, Myanmar is a participating member
of the AsDB-assisted Program of Economic
Cooperation in the Greater Mekong Subregion
(GMS Program). In that capacity, Myanmar
participates in regional meetings and
workshops. The AsDB, along with the World
Bank, facilitated damage assessment following
Cyclone Nargis in 2008. Close coordination is
being maintained with the IMF, the World
Bank, and the UNDP with particular emphasis
being given to assessment of the
government’s economic reform program and
recommended policy actions. Liaison is being
maintained with Myanmar’s major bilateral
donors regarding the status of their assistance
program. As of February 9, 2012, Myanmar’s
total overdue loan service payments in respect
1

of the AsDB’s Asian Development Fund (ADF)
loans were equivalent to US$493.3million.
Myanmar repaid on December 18, 2003 its
OCR due to the AsDB amounting to
EUR 1,225,200 and accordingly cleared its
arrears under OCR loans. To date, Myanmar
has not provided any indication of its intention
to clear the overdue loan service payments
under 28 ADF loans. Myanmar has subscribed
to additional shares of AsDB's fifth general
capital increase. Each AsDB member is entitled
to a 200 percent increase in its allocated
shares. Myanmar's additional subscription
became effective on August 12, 2010 and its
share of total subscribed capital is
0.545 percent as of February 9, 2012.
The majority of AsDB assistance has been
provided for the development of the
agricultural sector. Assistance in sectors other
than agriculture stemmed from an attempt to
achieve sectoral balance in lending. The
cumulative amount of AsDB lending to
Myanmar remains unchanged as shown below:

ANNEX VI. MYANMAR: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Assessment of Data Adequacy for
Surveillance
General. Data provision continues to have serious
shortcomings that hamper effective surveillance
even though a number of indicators are now
disseminated on the internet. Data are not provided
in a timely manner, while official and independent
estimates of key macroeconomic variables differ
widely.
National accounts. National accounts statistics

are available only on an annual basis with
considerable delay. Coverage of the private
sector is incomplete as a proper business
directory for sampling is not available yet.
Resource constraints, primarily at the Planning
Department and the Central Statistical
Organization limit the conduct of surveys. GDP
estimates do not completely account for informal
sector activity. Agricultural work-in-progress is
not included; construction is recorded on the
basis of construction permits; and taxes and
subsidies on products are excluded. Estimates of
goods for processing and deflators of financial
and insurance services need improvement.
However, progress has been made in updating
the base year to FY 2005/06 and surveys are
being conducted on agricultural costs,
manufacturing, and the informal sector, including
a plan to include data from the Chamber of
Commerce’s survey on private sector in GDP
estimation starting April 2012.
Price statistics. The base, basket, and weights of

the CPI were updated following previous STA TA
and derived from the Household Income and
Expenditure Survey of 2006. Weaknesses remain
as weights only represent urban households even
though rural areas were also surveyed; some
construction inputs are included; rentals of owner-

occupied housing are excluded; missing prices are
not imputed; and the classification of items is
outdated.
Government finance statistics. There is no
comprehensive monthly or quarterly compilation
of fiscal data. Annual comprehensive data are
compiled with delays of up to 12 months after
the end of the reference year. In addition, only
consolidated data for state economic enterprises
are available, and some transactions are recorded
partly on an accrual basis and partly on a cash
basis. Fiscal and monetary data are not
consistent. Budget estimates and actual
expenditures tend to differ by wide margins.
Annual data on the operations of the
consolidated central government were last
reported for 2005 to STA for publication in the
Government Finance Statistics Yearbook, but do
not include an economic classification of
expenditure. In addition, recording of debt
statistics are not comprehensive.
Monetary and financial statistics. The monetary

survey compiled by the CBM covers the central
bank and all commercial banks (public and
private). Reporting of monetary data in the
Standardized Report Forms, which accord with
the MFSM classification principles, was
established in January 2012. The quality of
monetary statistics could be improved by:
(i) using the market exchange rate, rather than
the overvalued official exchange rate, for valuing
foreign currency-denominated balance sheet
accounts; (ii) monitoring the consistency of
interbank accounts that show positions between
the CBM and the commercial banks; and
(iii) using electronic means to capture and share
data to minimize mistakes. In January 2012, the
CBM authorities were recommended that (i) on

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

MYANMAR

the date of adopting a managed float (and also
for that end-month), the CBM and all commercial
banks should prepare their balance sheets using
the previously in effect exchange rate and the
new exchange rate prevailing on the date of
unification (and at that end-month); (ii) amounts
contra to the revaluation of foreign currency
denominated positions (at the CBM and all
commercial banks) should be posted to the
valuation adjustment account rather than to the
profit and loss account; (iii) in due course, adopt
market or fair value-based valuation of financial
instruments; and (iv) review the accuracy of
recording the IMF Accounts in the CBM’s balance
sheet for consistency with FIN recommendations
and make revisions as called for.

Detailed data on services transactions and
financial flows are generally not available and
transactions that are not undertaken through the
official banking system are usually not estimated.
Evaluation of external debts, which are not
nominated in U.S. dollars, is conducted
irregularly; historical data are distorted by
applying the exchange rate at the evaluation
point. Trade data are recorded at the time of
entries by customs, causing serious volatility in
values and incorrect time records. Many of the
recommendations of the STA TA missions
conducted in 1999 and 2000 have not been
implemented.

External sector statistics. The coverage and

reliability of the balance of payments could be
improved. Merchandise imports are
underestimated as military imports and other
official imports, including imports linked to FDI
under joint venture agreements with exemptions
from custom duties, are generally excluded, and
an overvalued official exchange rate is still used
to convert some private sector transactions.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
May 7, 2012

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with
Myanmar
On March 19, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Myanmar. 1
Background
Against the background of economic and political reform momentum, growth is picking up
modestly. Real GDP growth is estimated to have increased to 5.3 percent in FY2010/11 (AprilMarch) helped by fiscal spending in the election year and buoyant commodity exports. Growth
is projected at 5½ percent in FY2011/12 and is expected to increase to 6 percent in FY2012/13,
driven by commodity exports and higher investment, supported by improved business
confidence. CPI inflation, at 6.4 percent (year-on-year) in October 2011, is projected to decline
to 4.2 percent in FY2011/12 from 8.9 percent in FY2010/11, mainly due to lower food prices and
less deficit monetization. Inflation is expected to pick up in FY2012/13 to 5.8 percent as the
recent drop in food prices phases out.
The parallel market exchange rate of the kyat has appreciated by 29 percent in nominal
effective terms since end-FY2009/10, primarily due to large inflows, which cannot find an outlet
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

due to the ‘export-first’ policy that restricts private imports to the availability of private export
earnings.
Risks to this outlook are balanced. On the downside, a drop in regional demand could
negatively affect exports, although Myanmar remains largely insulated from the developments in
advanced economies due to sanctions. However, a sustained appreciation of the currency could
further erode external competitiveness and constrain household incomes. On the upside, the
recent easing of foreign direct investment (FDI) restrictions on private land use and repatriation
of profits, further increase in credit, and continued progress toward exchange rate unification
could bolster growth.
The new government of Myanmar has embarked on a series of economic reforms beginning
with the exchange rate regime. The economy has been burdened with complex exchange
restrictions that give rise to multiple currency practices in informal but tolerated markets.
As a first step toward unification of multiple exchange rates, the authorities plan to adopt a
managed float as their new exchange rate regime and end the official peg to the SDR that has
been used primarily in public sector operations since 1977. They are taking steps to establish
the necessary market infrastructure, including by establishing an interbank market and foreign
currency operations at the Central Bank of Myanmar (CBM). To address immediate
appreciation pressures, the authorities have recently eased some of the exchange restrictions
by allowing foreign currency purchases for car imports under a special program, and health and
travel expenses abroad. They have also temporarily reduced taxes on key agricultural exports
to address declining external competitiveness.
The new government’s first budget targets a smaller deficit, notwithstanding a planned increase
in much needed social spending. The consolidated nonfinancial public sector deficit is projected
to decline from 5½ percent of GDP in FY2011/12 to 4.6 percent of GDP in FY2012/13. This is
primarily due to higher net transfers from state economic enterprises (SEEs), primarily from gas
exports, as the budget, for the first time, would apply market-based exchange rates for SEEs’
exports and imports. Spending on education and health is expected to increase to 7½ percent
of total expenditures, up from 5.4 percent. The CBM cut the administratively-set interest rates
by a cumulative four percentage points since September 2011, the first cuts since 2007. They
have also revised the fixed interest rate structure to provide financial incentives for banks to
hold treasury bonds, and as a consequence, deficit monetization is projected to decline to about
half of the fiscal deficit in FY2011/12.
The external position remains comfortable even though the current account is projected to
deteriorate. The current account deficit is projected to widen to 2.7 percent of GDP in
FY2011/12, from 0.8 percent of GDP in FY2010/11, as export growth falls short of fast import
growth linked to large FDI projects in the energy sector. Gross official reserves rose to

3
US$7.1 billion in September 2011, and are expected to remain comfortable at about 9.4 months
of imports in FY2011/12.
Formal financial intermediation remains repressed due to pervasive controls on banks. The
authorities relaxed the requirements on deposit taking, expanded the administratively-set
collateral list, eased controls on extending branch networks, and allowed some flexibility in
setting the deposit rates as part of the recent interest rate cuts. As a result private sector credit
growth has accelerated, albeit from a very low base.
The authorities have also taken some steps to promote rural growth and increase competition.
Harvest loans to farmers have been doubled, FDI rules have been relaxed, and imports of
gasoline and palm oil have been liberalized.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted the considerable economic potential of Myanmar, and welcomed the
authorities’ renewed commitment to address the country’s development challenges through far
reaching reforms. Improved policy frameworks and a carefully sequenced implementation of
reforms remain key to the success of the authorities’ strategy.
Directors concurred that reforming the exchange rate system is the top priority, and saw the
planned adoption of a managed float as the first step toward exchange rate unification. They
agreed that further steps are urgently needed to establish the necessary market infrastructure
and move away from the present inefficient system for allocating foreign exchange. In this
context, Directors encouraged the authorities to remove remaining exchange restrictions and
eliminate multiple currency practices as soon as circumstances permit.
Directors viewed the current stance of monetary policy as broadly appropriate. They welcomed
the authorities’ plans to grant the Central Bank of Myanmar operational autonomy to pursue
domestic price stability, and recommended transferring to it all central banking functions.
Directors welcomed progress in reducing deficit monetization, but considered that more needs
to be done. They encouraged the authorities to expand retail sales of government securities and
lift restrictions on their holdings by state-owned financial institutions, pending the establishment
of treasury bond auctions.
Directors welcomed plans to reduce the fiscal deficit while increasing social spending. They
agreed that a broadly balanced budget for the central government is an appropriate
medium-term target. Over time, growing revenues from natural resources and improved tax
structures will provide the resources to finance needed social spending and infrastructure.
Directors also agreed that strengthening public financial management is necessary to support
the reorientation of monetary policy and minimize fiscal risks, including those associated with
fiscal decentralization and the adoption of the managed float. Directors welcomed the

4
authorities’ efforts to reconcile some external arrears, and encouraged them to extend these
efforts to all creditors with a view to eventually clear the arrears.
Directors stressed that modernizing the financial system is essential to promote growth. They
welcomed the steps already taken to ease administrative controls on banks, and called for
further liberalization of bank operations and interest rates. Directors underscored that financial
reforms must be complemented by strengthened supervision and regulation.
Directors noted that broad-based sustainable growth and poverty reduction require structural
reforms to remove barriers to trade and foreign investment, enhance the business climate, and
improve agricultural productivity. Strengthening the statistical base is also crucial for policy
evaluation and design and should remain an important objective for policymakers. Underscoring
Myanmar’s significant needs for further capacity building, Directors welcomed the increased
involvement of International Financial Institutions (IFIs) and other donors in providing technical
assistance in a variety of areas, and stressed the importance of coordination among the
providers to avoid duplication of efforts or inefficient delivery.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat
