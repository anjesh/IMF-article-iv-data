Staff Report for the 2004 Article IV Consultation
and Request for Stand-By Arrangement
Prepared by the European Department
(in consultation with other departments)
Approved by Carlo Cottarelli and Anthony Boote
July 16, 2004
•

A team comprising Messrs. Demekas (head), Eskesen, Konuki, Vamvakidis (all EUR), Čihák
(MFD), Dodzin (PDR), and Norregaard (Resident Representative) conducted the discussions on
the 2004 Article IV consultation and the request for a Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) in Zagreb
during April 13–21 and May 18–25, 2004. Discussions on the SBA were concluded in
Washington during June 9–12. The team met Prime Minister Mr. Sanader; Deputy Prime
Ministers Mr. Hebrang and Ms. Kosor; Finance Minister Mr. Šuker; Sea, Tourism, Transport and
Development Minister Mr. Kalmeta; the Governor of the Croatian National Bank (CNB)
Mr. Rohatinski; senior government officials; and representatives of parties, unions, banks, and the
private sector. Mr. Stučka (OED) and World Bank staff attended some of these meetings.

•

In last November’s elections, the Social Democrats were ousted and the Croatian Democratic
Union (HDZ) came to power, heading a minority government with support by six other parties,
including the Pensioners’ Party and representatives of ethnic minorities.

•

The previous precautionary SBA, approved on February 3, 2003, expired on April 2, 2004, after
going off track in late 2003. The authorities have requested a successor SBA, which they also
intend to treat as precautionary. Access under the proposed arrangement would be SDR 97 million
(26.6 percent of quota) over a 20-month period. Policies under the SBA are presented in the
attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP).

•

Croatia applied for EU membership in February 2003. In its opinion on Croatia’s application in
April 2004, the European Commission noted that Croatia can be regarded as a market economy.
On June 18, 2004, the Council of the European Union granted candidate status to Croatia.
Accession negotiations are to start in early 2005.

•

The mission held a joint press conference with the Prime Minister at the end of the second
mission and engaged in other outreach activities. The authorities intend to publish this report and
the MEFP.

•

Croatia has accepted the obligations of Article VIII (Appendix I) and subscribes to the Special
Data Dissemination Standard (Appendix III). A full safeguards assessment of the CNB is
currently under way.

Executive Summary
Background: Since the mid-1990s, Croatia has recorded satisfactory growth and low
inflation. However, a persistent savings-investment gap over the same period has led to
high current account deficits and a build-up of foreign debt, trends that accelerated
in 2001–02 with a credit-fueled domestic demand boom. Private sector activity started
moderating in 2003 but there was a sharp reversal of fiscal policy in the runup to the
November elections, and the deficit jumped to 6.3 percent of GDP, derailing the last StandBy Arrangement (SBA). Although the current account improved last year due to large
tourism receipts, external debt continued to rise reflecting strong capital inflows.
Macroeconomic strategy and outlook: The new government this year has resumed the
fiscal consolidation effort, aiming at a substantial fiscal and quasi-fiscal adjustment
in 2004-05 in order to reduce the savings-investment imbalance and stabilize the external
debt-to-GDP ratio. The slowdown in private sector activity, notwithstanding significant
uncertainties and data deficiencies, should facilitate this task. In support of their policies,
the authorities have requested a new SBA, which they intend to treat as precautionary.
Fiscal policy: The government targets a fiscal deficit of 4.5 percent of GDP in 2004 and
3.7 percent in 2005, and has taken steps to eliminate off-budget fiscal transactions, contain
quasi-fiscal deficits, and improve transparency and public debt and expenditure
management. Staff welcomes the ambitious adjustment but expresses concerns about its
composition: the adjustment in 2004 relies to some extent on one-off revenues, effectively
postponing part of the adjustment effort to 2005; and not enough is being done to reduce
current spending, where Croatia compares unfavorably with similar countries. The
authorities explain the reliance on one-off measures in 2004 partly by the amount of
inherited spending obligations from last year, as well as by the fact that a number of
measures introduced this year will take time to bear fruit. Staff supports the authorities’
plans to reduce the deficit further over the medium term while simultaneously reducing the
high tax burden. To reconcile these objectives, staff recommends a comprehensive
medium-term expenditure policy framework, as well as reforms to contain the wage bill,
streamline social transfers, and reduce subsidies.
Monetary policy: The authorities argue that high degree of trade and capital account
integration, advanced currency substitution, and weak interest rate transmission—tested in
a staff Selected Issues paper—underscore the importance of exchange rate stability and
limit the scope for monetary policy. Staff points out the attendant risks but acknowledges
that the CNB’s pragmatic approach to monetary policy has worked well. Monetary policy
will focus on limiting net domestic asset growth and preparing the ground for open market
operations.
Structural policies and financial sector issues: The banking system is generally sound
and banking supervision has improved over recent years. The authorities are committed to
closing gaps in financial sector supervision, preserving the sustainability of the pension
system, and restoring momentum to other structural reforms.

I. BACKGROUND AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
1.
Since the mid-1990s, Croatia has established a record of satisfactory growth
and low inflation. Real GDP growth has averaged 4½ percent with inflation in the low
single digits. These numbers compare well with the EU-15 and Central and Eastern
European countries (CEECs).

2.
Structural reform has progressed and the private sector is vibrant, but Croatia
still lags somewhat behind the CEECs. The economy is open to trade and capital flows;
privatization is advanced, albeit uneven; the private sector accounts for 60 percent of the
economy, including virtually the entire banking system; and foreign direct investment
(FDI) has been strong. But partly due to the war in the early 1990s, Croatia lags the CEECs
in terms of overall progress: the state still maintains a significant role in the economy in the
form of high government spending

Domestic investment has outstripped savings since the mid-1990s, resulting in
persistent current account deficits and a gradual buildup of foreign debt.
Liberalization and privatization stimulated extensive restructuring and high investment.
Public infrastructure investment, particularly in roads, has averaged an extraordinary
6½ percent of GDP in recent years. This was accompanied by a rise in imports—especially
capital goods—to 45 percent of GDP by the end of the 1990s. Tourism has become

increasingly important as a source of
foreign exchange. Nonetheless, current
account deficits have persisted since
the mid-1990s (Figure 1) and errors &
omissions have been consistently large
and negative. Although Croatia has
been able to attract high FDI relative to
other CEECs, there has also been a
gradual buildup of both public and
private foreign debt, facilitated by
Croatia’s investment grade rating and
low world interest rates and spreads
(Figure 2).

These trends accelerated since the turn of the decade, fueled by a credit boom
in 2001–02. Following the 1998–99 banking crisis, the remaining state-owned banks were

5.
Macroeconomic policies did not manage to contain the credit-financed surge in
domestic demand and the external position deteriorated sharply in 2001–02. The fiscal
consolidation underway was not sufficient to offset the growth in private consumption and
investment. Monetary policy was constrained by the CNB’s preference for nominal
exchange rate stability and a very open capital account. As a result, the current account
deficit rose sharply to 8.4 percent of GDP in 2002 (Table 1).
6.
Private sector activity started moderating in the second half of 2003. The
momentum of domestic demand from 2002 was largely carried forward in 2003 and real
GDP growth still averaged 4.3 percent. But Q4 national accounts and monthly indicators
suggest that private consumption and investment have started slowing down—trends that
have continued in early 2004 (Figure 3). Several factors may explain this slowdown: a
natural unwinding of the boom in 2002 and early 2003, debt-carrying capacity constraints,
and the bank credit ceilings imposed by the CNB last year (see below), which may have
had a dampening impact on household consumption. But lack of data precludes a full
assessment of these trends.

However, there was a sharp reversal of fiscal policy as spending discipline
evaporated in the runup to the November 2003 elections.
•

Worrying signs were already evident in the fall, when the annual spending plan of
the Highway Construction Agency (HAC) was raised by 0.2 percent of GDP (partly
offset by higher expected toll revenues). In the event, despite assurances to the
contrary,1 even the revised HAC spending plan was exceeded by 0.4 percent of
GDP, other capital and current spending was also above budget, and the general
government deficit as defined under the program for the year as a whole exceeded
the target under the last SBA (4.5 percent of GDP) by almost one percentage point,
derailing the program (Table 2).

•

In addition, two large off-budget fiscal operations had taken place even before the
last quarter. First, the state-owned and controlled Croatian Development Bank
(HBOR) provided loans for housing reconstruction, whose servicing was the
responsibility of the Ministry of Construction. And second, the chronically lossmaking Croatian Railways (HŽ), which was already receiving sizeable budget
transfers, was directed to borrow additional funds under government guarantee for
financing both operating and capital expenses, with the liabilities subsequently
taken over by the budget. Including these two operations in the general government
accounts implies a fiscal deficit of 6.3 percent of GDP in 2003 (Table 3 and
Figure 4).

attempt to control aggregate demand. Faced with

Despite the fiscal relaxation, the current account improved in 2003 due to

continued strong and the trade balance deteriorated, the current account deficit declined to

The previous government had assured the Fund, including in a letter to Management on
December 16, that higher HAC outlays would be offset by lower-than-budgeted central
government spending, so that the end-year performance criterion on the general
government deficit under the SBA would be observed.

6.1 percent of GDP last year as tourism receipts surged by over 6 percentage points of GDP
(Table 5).2 Negative errors & omissions were an additional 4.2 percent of GDP. Partly
reflecting a buildup of official reserves to a record 5 months of imports, external debt
jumped to 74½ percent of GDP at end-2003.
10.
Developments in early 2004 confirm the moderate pace of private activity.
Although the credit ceilings were abolished, credit growth has not bounced back,
suggesting that the deceleration in 2003 was demand-driven: annualized seasonallyadjusted credit growth for the first five months of 2004 was 14½ percent, virtually the same
as last year. Private foreign borrowing in the first quarter was also subdued. Preliminary Q1
national accounts show a slight strengthening in domestic demand but also a pickup in net
exports. However, the seasonally-adjusted current account deficit in Q1 was still large and,
partly due to seasonally high financing needs, external debt rose to 77 percent of GDP at
end-May.
11.
The financial sector remains sound despite the rapid credit expansion
since 2001. Financial soundness indicators signal a further improvement in the health of
the banking system since the previous FSAP (Table 6). Profitability has remained strong,
asset quality continued to improve (allowing a decline in the ratio of provisions to
nonperforming loans), and the banking system has generally been liquid. However, banks
are still vulnerable to credit risk due to currency mismatch between assets and liabilities in
some of their clients.
II. REPORT ON THE ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION DISCUSSIONS
12.
Discussions started from the recognition of macroeconomic vulnerabilities and
focused on policies to reduce these in the short and the medium term. Neither the fiscal
slippage in 2003 nor recent developments in emerging bond markets have affected
Croatia’s spreads. The authorities pointed out that the EU’s recent decision to extend
candidate status to Croatia provided additional reassurance about long-term prospects, a
perception confirmed by market participants and rating agencies (indeed S&P changed the
outlook for Croatia’s BBB- rating to positive). But all agreed that the extent of the external
imbalance was a source of concern: Croatia’s external debt-to-GDP ratio was more than
twice the average of emerging markets and substantially higher than in the CEECs; in
addition, the recent trends were unsustainable. Staff noted that net external debt (excluding
official reserves and commercial bank foreign assets), which may be a better measure of
external sustainability, had also risen—albeit at a more moderate pace than gross debt—
reaching 36 percent of GDP at end-May. In these conditions, a sharp rise in interest rates or
other external shocks (e.g., affecting tourism) might lead to financing difficulties and force
an abrupt current account adjustment. The fiscal deficit in 2003 had also reached a level
that was unsustainable: with a primary deficit of 4¼ percent of GDP, the government debt-

- 13 -

to-GDP ratio was bound to rise rapidly over time. To reverse these trends required both
immediate macroeconomic policy action and sustained structural reform.
A. The Overall Economic Strategy
13.
The authorities’ overarching macroeconomic goal was to narrow the domestic
savings-investment gap so as to reverse the trend of the external debt-to-GDP ratio
over the medium term. On the assumption that non debt-creating capital flows would
gradually decline over the medium term as privatization is completed, staff projections
(Table 7) indicated that a current account deficit of 5–5½ percent of GDP in 2004–05,
gradually declining to about 4 percent in the medium term, would first stabilize and then
start reducing the external debt burden. The authorities broadly agreed, although they felt
that non privatization-related FDI was likely to get a boost from the prospects of EU
accession.
14.
Fiscal consolidation was the centerpiece of the authorities’ strategy to achieve
this goal. With competitiveness at a broadly comfortable level (Box 1), reducing the
domestic savings-investment gap required reining in aggregate demand. Authorities and
staff agreed that fiscal policy was the instrument of choice for two reasons: first, especially
after the slippage in 2003, the fiscal deficit was a major cause of the excess aggregate
demand pressures and public debt was at an unsustainable path; and second, Croatia’s
choice of exchange rate stability as the guiding principle of monetary policy, aside from
other implications, meant that the burden for managing aggregate demand fell on fiscal
policy.
15.
The authorities also saw the need for fiscal consolidation in a broader context.
Restoring discipline and transparency in public finances after 2003 was important not only
from a macroeconomic point of view but also for the accountability and credibility,
domestically and abroad, of the state. For this reason, the consolidation effort would not
only focus on reducing the government deficit but encompass quasi-fiscal operations, debt
management, and the wider public sector. The government also saw consolidation
in 2004-05 as the foundation for future measures to reduce the high tax burden in Croatia.
16.
An alternative strategy, relying on substantially greater exchange rate
flexibility and monetary tightening, was discussed with the authorities, but its benefits
were uncertain. Although it would reduce some of the risks associated with exchange rate
stability, its merits in terms of greater leeway for monetary policy were dubious
(section D). In addition, focusing the action to contain aggregate demand on monetary
tightening would likely result in a marked appreciation, with adverse implications on
competitiveness and the external balance, and potentially destabilize expectations.

- 14 -

Box 1. Recent Competitiveness Trends
A study on Croatia’s competitiveness during the last Article IV consultation concluded that Croatian export
performance had been mixed: while goods exports lagged compared to other CEECs, exports of services, in particular
transportation and tourism, had grown vigorously. The real effective exchange rate (REER) and unit labor cost (ULC)
indicators did not suggest any problems. Authorities and staff agreed that these trends reflected Croatia’s comparative
advantage in tourism.
These trends have continued. In 2000–2003, the growth of merchandise exports was among the lowest in CEECs.
However, growth of services exports (mainly tourism) was among the highest, and overall Croatia’s share of exports of
goods and services increased. The share of Croatian tourism sector has increased among European countries with major
tourist destinations and a study by the World Trade and Tourism Council rated Croatia’s tourism sector highly across a
number of indicators. REER and ULC continue to suggest a comfortable position. For more details, see Appendix V.

17.
Over the medium term, economic and structural policies would also be driven
by the exigencies of EU accession. EU accession as early as possible was the authorities’
ultimate objective. The authorities were aware that this had manifold implications for fiscal
policy: the deficit had to converge to EU norms, state aid reduced, the public
administration modernized, and room made for new accession-related expenditures. At the
same time, harmonization with the acquis communautaire would require an acceleration of
structural reforms over a broad front.
18.
The authorities have requested a new SBA in support of their policies
for 2004–05. In view of the imminent start of EU membership negotiations, the new
government asked for Fund support of their policies for 2004–05 in the form of a new
SBA, which they intend to treat as precautionary. Policies under the proposed SBA are
detailed in the attached MEFP and program issues are discussed in section III.

- 15 -

B. Macroeconomic Outlook
19.
The private consumption slowdown and renewed fiscal adjustment would
moderate growth and lead to an improvement in the external position in 2004–05. The
authorities and staff expected private consumption growth to decelerate in 2004 and start
recovering moderately in 2005, partly underpinned by fiscal consolidation. Private
investment growth was also expected to moderate somewhat but still make a positive
contribution to GDP growth during these two years. Data on bank credit and import growth
through May corroborate these projections. Exports were projected to rise in line with
external demand. On this basis, real GDP growth would decline to 3¾ percent in 2004 and
recover only modestly to about 4 percent in 2005 and the current account deficit remain in
the 5–5½ percent of GDP range in both years. Assuming a modest increase in non
privatization-related FDI and continued large negative errors & omissions,3 staff expected
the external debt-to-GDP ratio to remain at about 77 percent in 2004–05. Inflation was
expected to accelerate reflecting higher oil prices but remain below 3 percent in 2004–05.
20.
This short-term outlook was subject to considerable uncertainties,
underscoring the need for a more aggressive approach to demand management. Staff
cautioned that tourism receipts may not remain at the unprecedented level of 2003 and that
the causes behind the slowdown in private sector activity were not fully understood, raising
the possibility of a rapid resumption in private domestic and foreign borrowing later this
year. The authorities were confident that recent tourism trends would be sustained, pointing
out encouraging first quarter data and information on advance bookings for the summer,
but agreed that major uncertainties surrounded the outlook for private consumption and
investment. Indeed the CNB projected somewhat higher private capital inflows in 2004
resulting, all other things being equal, in an external debt ratio of about 79 percent of GDP
by year-end. The staff argued that, if anything, these risks underscored the need for more
conservative fiscal targets in 2004–05.
21.
The immediate need to reduce external vulnerability notwithstanding, staff’s
medium-term projections highlighted the importance of policies with a longer-term
payoff. The staff’s baseline medium-term scenario indicated that, even if the external debt
ratio was put on a declining path, Croatia would continue to rely on sizeable external
savings. Foreign debt would still be over 70 percent of GDP by end-2009 and sensitivity
analysis showed that it could be substantially higher (though not above 90 percent of GDP)
in most plausible alternative scenarios (Appendix IV). The authorities agreed with the staff
that structural reforms, in particular measures to supplement and sustain fiscal
consolidation, were also a critically important part of their economic policies for 2004–05.

3

Although it is unusual to forecast errors & omissions, staff considers them unrecorded
outflows that are unlikely to disappear in the short run.

- 16 -

C. Fiscal Policy
Fiscal policy in 2004–05
22.
The key objectives of the government’s fiscal policy for 2004 were to resume
fiscal consolidation and restore transparency. The 2004 budget (MEFP ¶10–11),
including a supplementary budget approved by parliament on July 15, aimed at a general
government deficit of 4.5 percent of GDP. This was to be achieved through an increase in
revenues and, to a lesser extent, a reduction in investment. The former reflected one-off
revenues (dividend payments and larger-than-expected receipts from the concession of a
GSM license totaling almost 1 percentage point of GDP) and a hike in excise rates on cars
and tobacco as of July 15. The government was also taking a number of permanent
measures which, however, would have an impact only starting next year, notably the reestablishment of the Financial Police; limits to borrowing by local governments; and
measures to control health sector spending, where significant slippages had occurred
in 2003 (MEFP ¶11). To improve transparency and contain quasi-fiscal deficits, the
government intended to reflect all financing of HŽ and loans for housing reconstruction onbudget, as well as curtail all other HBOR activities. Indeed by end-July, HBOR’s
Supervisory Board would reduce its lending plan for 2004 by HRK 200 million, bringing
its target deficit (net of budget transfers) to ½ percent of GDP.
23.
In 2005, the emphasis would shift to expenditure measures to reach a deficit of
3.7 percent of GDP (MEFP ¶13). Current spending would be reduced by 1 percentage
point of GDP reflecting a lower wage

24.
Staff welcomed the ambitious deficit targets for 2004–05 but questioned the
composition of the planned adjustment. The total fiscal and quasi-fiscal adjustment
implied by the government’s plans during 2004–05 amounted to 2¾ percentage points of
GDP. This seemed to be consistent with the objective of reducing the domestic savings-

- 17 -

investment gap by just over 1 percent of GDP, even assuming some offsetting decline in
private savings. Moreover, this adjustment would bring the primary deficit closer to a level
that, even in the absence of privatization receipts, would stabilize the government debt ratio

shifted part of the adjustment to next year.
25.
The authorities explained that the underlying adjustment in current
expenditure was larger than it appeared, and saw the one-off revenue measures
in 2004 as a necessary expedient. The 2004 budget was burdened by one-off obligations
inherited from last year, notably hospital arrears and contracts for housing reconstruction
amounting to 0.4 percent of GDP (MEFP ¶9). Moreover, measures that would generate
permanent savings in current transfers (e.g., health spending) and improve the operations of
loss-making public enterprises that burdened the budget (notably HŽ) were launched this
year but would take time. These factors justified the recourse to one-off revenue measures
in 2004, which the authorities saw as a transitional year. They nonetheless stressed their
commitment to the deficit target, and outlined concrete contingency measures to be taken
by November 1 should it come under threat (MEFP ¶12).
26.
Budget financing would gradually shift to domestic sources. Both sides agreed
that, despite higher borrowing costs, shifting to domestic financing would help reduce the
government’s exposure to exchange rate risk, boost the development of the domestic
capital market, and might help absorb excess liquidity in the private sector in the short run.
Therefore, staff welcomed the plan to meet at least one-third of the government’s
borrowing requirement from domestic sources this year and raise this proportion in 2005
(MEFP ¶15).
27.
In addition to reining on fiscal and quasi-fiscal deficits, the authorities
intended to control contingent liabilities. Staff and authorities agreed that debt
guarantees allowed the recipient enterprises to lower their costs without, at the same time,
allowing the government to exercise sufficient control on how these implicit subsidies were
spent. The government thus planned to keep the nominal stock of outstanding guarantees
from increasing during 2004–05 (MEFP ¶16).

- 18 -

Fiscal policy in the medium term
28.
Although the government was still formulating its medium-term fiscal plans at
the time of the discussions, the broad themes were already clear.
•

Deficit reduction would remain the overarching objective. After the major
adjustment in 2004–05, the general government deficit would be reduced by
approximately ½ percentage point of GDP per year until it was below the
Maastricht ceiling of 3 percent.

•

Lowering the tax burden was a key element of the government’s agenda. Initial
plans to reduce the standard VAT rate from 22 to 20 percent in 2005 proved too
costly, given the magnitude of the required adjustment, and were abandoned. The
government was still planning to reduce some direct tax rates and broaden the tax
base in 2005 (MEFP ¶14) in a revenue-neutral way, but intended to prepare a bolder
tax reform in the medium term.

•

The process of harmonization with EU legislation would necessitate significant
adjustments in spending priorities.

29.
Staff supported these priorities, stressing, however, that fiscal policy should
remain flexible and responsive to macroeconomic objectives. The planned reduction in
the general government deficit was appropriate: government debt would stabilize
in 2004-05 partly due to the planned privatization receipts; continued effort was thus
necessary to ensure sustainability. While welcoming the decision on VAT, staff supported
the authorities’ medium-term plans for tax reform: Croatia’s tax burden was high compared
to other CEECs (Table 8), sapping the private sector’s growth potential and encouraging
tax evasion. Tax reform should focus on lowering the tax burden on capital and labor and
simplifying the system. But staff cautioned against too rigid an approach: as the main
macroeconomic policy instrument, fiscal policy should remain oriented first and foremost
to reducing external vulnerability and maintaining macroeconomic equilibrium.
30.
Against this background, the authorities and staff agreed that a medium-term
expenditure framework was critical to reconcile the objectives of deficit reduction, tax
reform, and expenditure reallocation. Such a framework would illustrate tradeoffs and
allow rational planning of tax and expenditure reforms so as to reduce the size of the
government in a sustainable way. In the staff’s view, expenditure reforms should focus on
further rationalizing public administration and the health sector, streamlining the welfare
system, and reducing direct and indirect subsidies. A medium-term fiscal framework would
also be required once EU accession negotiations start. As a first step, the government
intended to prepare rolling three-year budgets starting with the 2005 budget (MEFP ¶23)
and requested the staff’s assistance in this task.

- 19 -

D. Monetary Policy
31.
Croatia’s choice of a stable exchange rate was dictated by the openness of the
economy and advanced currency substitution. In addition to the usual reasons justifying
“fear of floating” (an import-to-GDP ratio of over 50 percent, high trade and capital market
integration with the euro area, limited hedging opportunities for kuna holders), the
authorities pointed out two related factors at play: memories of hyperinflation in the former
Yugoslavia and advanced currency substitution (75 percent of bank loans and almost
90 percent of banks deposits were in foreign currency—largely euro—or foreign currencylinked instruments). Under these circumstances, the authorities saw stability in the
kuna/euro rate as the predominant monetary policy objective, although they have eschewed
a formal commitment to a certain level.
32.
Staff saw merits in the CNB’s policy framework despite the risks. First, it has
performed well over time, ensuring low inflation and anchoring expectations while
supporting policies have maintained competitiveness. Second, the CNB was operating this
framework pragmatically, allowing short-term exchange rate fluctuations (±4½ percent
around the average since 1999). Third, the liberalization of most short-term capital controls
in 2001 meant that short-term capital flows would increasingly limit the impact of the CNB
on money market rates: indeed there was some evidence that the sensitivity of short-term
flows to interest rates had increased since 2001 (Selected Issues paper). And fourth, even if
there were a link between monetary policy stance and money market rates, the transmission
of money market rates to bank lending rates was at best weak (Box 2 and Selected Issues
Box 2. The Evidence on Interest Rate Transmission
•

Although money market interest rates increased during 2003 in response to several hikes in the kuna portion
of required reserves (from 25 to 42 percent), the effective lending rate of domestic banks remained unaffected
(left chart); so did the spread between this and foreign interest rates (right chart).

•

This impression is confirmed by Granger tests that do not indicate a link between (lagged) policy rates and
the effective lending rate. This may, of course, reflect the absence of effective policy instruments rather than
fundamentals. In 2003, in particular, it may also be due to credit rationing in response to the ceilings.

•

VAR models suggest that changes in policy rates do get transmitted to lending rates but with long lags (6–9
months, compared to the typical 1–3 months). However, most of the data used for the VAR cover the period
before the liberalization of capital flows in 2001, when such transmission was to be expected.

paper). Altogether, this suggested that one cannot rely much on monetary policy for
aggregate demand management. Still, staff pointed out that this policy framework
encouraged unhedged borrowing, perpetuated currency mismatches, and placed the burden
for demand management almost entirely on fiscal policy.
33.
Both sides nonetheless agreed that monetary policy could still help reduce
external vulnerability. In the context of its 2004 monetary program (MEFP ¶19), the CNB
planned to modernize its toolkit and, in close cooperation with the Ministry of Finance,
start open market operations (OMOs) with government paper. Although these were
unlikely to be very effective in altering monetary conditions, they could enhance liquidity
management and facilitate the shift in government financing toward domestic sources. To
avoid an unwarranted liquidity injection that might spur credit expansion, the CNB aimed
at maintaining its net domestic assets at their end-March level (except for purchases of
government paper required to kickstart OMOs toward the end of the year). And to signal its
commitment to the external objectives of its program, the CNB introduced on July 1 a
marginal reserve requirement on foreign borrowing (MEFP ¶20).
34.
The CNB reiterated that capital controls remained a last-resort policy option.
In case unexpected capital inflows threatened macroeconomic stability, the CNB was
prepared to introduce price-based capital controls. Staff felt that the circumstances under
which the benefits of capital controls could outweigh the costs in an economy like Croatia
were limited. The CNB concurred, seeing these measures as a last-resort stop-gap until
other policies adjust or inflows abate.
E. Structural and Financial Sector Policies
Public sector reforms
35.
Enhancing fiscal transparency and improving expenditure and debt
management were key elements of the government’s agenda for 2004–05. In addition to
incorporating HŽ financing and housing reconstruction loans into the budget and limiting
HBOR’s quasi-fiscal activities and the issuance of contingent public liabilities, as described
above, the government requested a fiscal ROSC and technical assistance on improving debt
management. The two missions had delivered their preliminary recommendations and, at
the time of the discussions, the authorities were formulating their action plans (MEFP ¶22).
Key objectives were the introduction of commitments-based reporting and the
establishment by end-2005 of a single treasury account, including the two largest spending
agencies (for highway and road construction).
36.
Authorities and staff explored means to ensure financial discipline and
continued restructuring in public enterprises. Although their aggregate financial
condition had been steadily improving in recent years, there were important pockets of
weakness, as the case of HŽ demonstrated. The government had a case-by-case approach: it
had discontinued the practice of hidden subsidies to HŽ and, in cooperation with the World
Bank, was preparing a business plan for the company, which should be completed by yearend; and it had started restructuring efforts for Croatian Forests and the shipping company

- 21 -

Jadrolinija. Staff supported this approach, but felt that the aggregate borrowing of the
largest public enterprises should also be closely monitored—a suggestion the government
accepted (MEFP ¶17).
37.
The authorities reiterated their commitment to the sustainability of the
pension system. The government in March revised the indexation formula to link pensions
to real wages (pensions were previously indexed to the average of prices and wages), and
was studying ways to honor a 1998 Constitutional Court decision on “pensioners’ debt”.4
Staff expressed concern: although the new indexation formula did not threaten
sustainability (the share of pension spending to GDP was projected to decline), linking
nominal pensions to real wages might increase the volatility of pensioners’ benefits; and
the size of “pensioners’ debt” was unclear and, depending on the means used to repay it,
could prove costly. The government explained that these steps had been taken under the
terms of an agreement with the Pensioners’ Party, on whose parliamentary support it relied,
and reiterated its commitment to safeguarding the core of the 1998 pension reform and
ensuring the viability of the system—a commitment repeated to the staff by the Pensioners’
Party. The government stood ready to make any adjustments to the system that may be
necessary in this regard. Furthermore, it emphasized that payments against “pensioners’
debt” would not be in cash or bonds but take the form of state equity, and agreed to consult
with the Fund and the World Bank before finalizing the scheme (MEFP ¶24).
Financial sector issues
38.
Against reassuring indicators of banking sector soundness, discussions focused
on measures to close gaps in supervision and improve monitoring of foreign exchange
risk. Banking supervision had been improved in recent years in line with key FSAP
recommendations, but some gaps remained. Staff noted the recent rapid expansion of
unregulated and unsupervised leasing companies (whose assets had reached 6 percent of
bank assets at end-2003), as well as the significant risk transfer from banks to insurance
companies (which was now roughly equal to the latter’s capital plus provisions). To cover
these gaps, the authorities planned to unify supervision of nonbank financial institutions
(MEFP ¶26). Staff noted that, while such unification would be useful, efforts to cover some
of these gaps should not wait for the merger of supervisory agencies. Staff also
recommended improved supervisory cooperation between bank and nonbank supervision
and between domestic and foreign supervisory agencies. Finally, although the banking
system was covered against direct foreign exchange risk, it was exposed indirectly through
unhedged customers, in particular households and retail business, who accounted for about
60 percent of bank loans. Therefore, the CNB and staff agreed that the closer monitoring of
customers’ foreign exchange risk during on-site bank inspections was appropriate.

4

The decision had validated claims of discriminatory treatment by pensioners in earlier
periods.

- 22 -

39.
Staff has prepared factual updates of three financial sector ROSCs. These
report on progress in banking supervision, the payments system, and securities regulation
since the 2002 FSAP and are circulated separately.
Other structural issues
40.
The government intended to restore momentum in privatization notably
through the sale by mid-2005 of all remaining government holdings in the portfolio of the
Privatization Fund, which would then be closed; the second phase of privatization of the oil
company (INA); further sales of shares in the telecommunications company, which was
already majority private; and plans to start privatizing the insurance company (MEFP ¶25).
41.
A World Bank Programmatic Adjustment Loan (PAL) under preparation
would provide a framework for other microeconomic reforms. The PAL, expected to
be finalized by early next year, would focus inter alia on judicial and public administration
reforms (Appendix II). Staff also recommended measures to improve the business
environment and—following the amendments to the labor law earlier this year—to relax
further employment protection legislation.
42.
Croatia’s trade policy was guided by its obligations to the WTO and the need
for harmonization with EU rules. As of May 2004, Croatia had signed trade liberalization
agreements with more than thirty countries. A major step toward regional trade integration
was accomplished when the agreement with Serbia and Montenegro became operational.
Tariffs were progressively lowered (industrial MFN tariffs would average less than
4 percent by end-2005, although some individual tariffs were much higher), and the
authorities were planning to start discussions on a new agreement on trade in textiles with
the EU once the current one expires in January 2005.
43.
The quality of statistical data remained mixed. Despite recent progress,
significant weaknesses persisted. In particular, the large discrepancy between the demand
components and total GDP and the sizeable negative errors & omissions in the balance of
payments hampered the analysis of domestic and external savings. The authorities were
considering technical assistance from the Fund to improve balance of payments statistics.
III. DESIGN OF THE PROPOSED ARRANGEMENT
44.
The experience with the last SBA was mixed. Policies were broadly in line with
the program most of last year and two reviews were completed (in August and November).
There was also progress in a number of structural areas, notably bank supervision and
privatization. But lack of ownership by the previous government meant that the program
did not provide an effective anchor for macroeconomic policies in the runup to the
elections: tensions with the CNB increased as the burden fell on monetary policy, most
end-December performance criteria were not met—some by wide margins—and the third
review was not completed. The program also did not do enough to control quasi-fiscal
deficits. The improvement in the current account was largely the result of a positive
external shock and was not sufficient to avert a further increase in foreign indebtedness.

- 23 -

45.
These lessons have been reflected in the proposed program. The authorities saw
the new SBA as a useful framework for their macroeconomic policies for 2004–05, when
negotiations with the EU are supposed to start. The experience with fiscal policy in 2003
was reflected in several key features of their policy program for 2004–05 (the emphasis on
budgetary transparency, steps to curtail lending by HBOR, measures to introduce a single
treasury account and improve debt management, and the move toward a medium-term
fiscal framework), as well as in the design of the proposed SBA (in addition to the general
government deficit, performance criteria are proposed on the net lending of HBOR and
issuance of government debt guarantees, an indicative ceiling on net borrowing by public
enterprises, a structural performance criterion on the introduction of 3-year rolling budgets
starting in 2005, and structural benchmarks focusing on public finance reforms).5 Staff
believed that ownership of this program by the government would be strong, especially
given the phase of the electoral cycle.
46.
Access under the proposed SBA is low and the authorities intend to treat it as
precautionary. The proposed 20-month SBA would end in April 2006. The requested
amount under the arrangement, equivalent to SDR 97 million (26.6 percent of quota),
would be made available in seven purchases (Table 9).6 A somewhat lower level of access
compared to the last SBA was seen as a symbolic step toward graduating from UFR. A new
safeguards assessment of the CNB is under way.
47.
Should purchases nonetheless be made, staff is confident that Croatia can meet
its financial obligations to the Fund. Under the proposed purchase schedule, Fund credit
outstanding would peak at 1.8 percent of gross official reserves in 2005, while debt service
to the Fund would not exceed 1 percent of exports of goods & nonfactor services during the
repayment period (Tables 10–12).
48.
The program is subject to both macroeconomic and policy-related risks. An
abrupt deterioration in external conditions—such as a sharp downturn in tourism or sudden
shifts in private capital inflows—or an acceleration of bank credit would require
reassessing the program targets. However, the quality of statistical data and uncertainties
underlying recent trends weaken the ability of both authorities and staff to monitor and
respond effectively to rapid changes in the macroeconomic environment. HDZ’s minority
government appears to be strong and its popularity was boosted by the positive EU
decision. Its commitment to fiscal discipline has been underscored by its willingness to
take politically difficult measures (most notably stopping hidden subsidies and postponing
the VAT rate cut) but may still be tested by domestic political pressures. Weak control over
decentralized spending agencies until the single treasury account is fully operational also

In keeping with normal practice, Croatia would be allowed to withdraw its first credit
tranche upon approval.

- 24 -

creates risks. Despite the measures under the program, state-owned enterprises still
represent a potential threat to fiscal discipline.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
49.
Despite the disruptions in the first half of the 1990s, Croatia’s economic and
policy record is good. Economic growth has been strong, with inflation in the low single
digits. Structural reform has advanced, though still lagging CEECs. Strong FDI, increasing
tourist arrivals, easy access to capital at low spreads and, not least, the recent decision by
the European Council to declare it a candidate country attest to the international confidence
and popularity Croatia enjoys.
50.
But this good performance was accompanied by a gradual worsening of
Croatia’s external position, which accelerated since the turn of the decade. The
growing gap between domestic savings and investment, spurred further by a credit boom
and sizeable capital inflows since 2001, has pushed the current account deficit and external
debt to high levels. Although private sector activity has recently moderated and the current
account balance improved, external debt rose further. As a result, Croatia has become more
vulnerable to external shocks.
51.
The authorities have recognized the extent of the external imbalance and
adopted a strategy that relies on fiscal consolidation to redress it. Despite its risks, the
choice of exchange rate stability has worked well for Croatia and continues to be
appropriate, as long as supporting policies are in place. The level of exchange rate is
broadly appropriate from the view point of competitiveness. The renewed emphasis on
fiscal consolidation is thus welcome, as monetary policy can only play a supporting role.
But however ambitious they may appear today, fiscal and monetary targets can only be
judged in reference to the goal of macroeconomic stability. If future external developments
jeopardize this goal, policies should be adjusted accordingly.
52.
The fiscal targets for 2004–05 are ambitious but the composition of the
planned adjustment is not optimal. A total fiscal and quasi-fiscal adjustment of
2¾ percentage points of GDP is substantial although, helped by the projected cooling of
private sector activity, just the minimum required to stabilize the external debt-to-GDP
ratio at about its current level by end-2005. Significant uncertainties remain regarding
private capital inflows, underscoring the need to keep policies—especially fiscal policy—
flexible. But not enough is done to reduce the share of current spending, especially
entitlements, where Croatia compares unfavorably with countries at a similar level of
development. Greater effort in this area would have allowed a more ambitious deficit
reduction and/or a larger reduction in the tax burden during 2004–05. Moreover, relying
partly on one-off revenue measures in 2004, though understandable given the inherited
burden from 2003 and the magnitude of the planned adjustment this year, shifts part of the
adjustment effort to the future.
53.
Expenditure reform will be the main challenge in the medium term. The
government is to be commended for postponing the reduction of VAT rates planned

- 25 -

for 2005; this has brought the ambitious targets for 2004–05 within reach. But even if this
adjustment succeeds in stabilizing public debt and reducing external vulnerability, the task
of expenditure reform will still need to be tackled. The government’s goals of reducing the
tax burden and the size of the government, as well as reallocating spending priorities in
order to meet EU-related needs, cannot be achieved without far-reaching reforms of
government spending. These should focus on the wage bill, welfare system, and subsidies.
The government’s commitment to start preparing three-year rolling budgets in 2005 is an
important first step.
54.
Measures to enhance transparency, control quasi-fiscal activities, and improve
expenditure and debt management are crucial parts of the government’s program.
Against the experience in 2003, the measures to include all financing of HŽ into the
budget, introduce gradually a single treasury account, control the issuance of government
debt guarantees, and monitor the financial performance of public enterprises are critical for
the success of the government’s program.
55.
Monetary policy has a secondary but nonetheless important role to play in the
effort to reduce the external imbalance. The CNB alone cannot manage aggregate
demand effectively. But managing bank liquidity will still be important in Croatia’s bankdominated financial sector. The CNB should continue to allow short-term exchange rate
fluctuations as in the past and stand ready to take additional measures to safeguard its
international reserves target, if needed. The plans to introduce open market operations and
the commitment to cooperate closely with the Ministry of Finance are welcome.
56.
Structural reform efforts should be revitalized. The authorities recognize the
need for structural reforms but implementation has been patchy in the past. Completing the
sale of Privatization Fund holdings by mid-2005 and privatizing or continuing the
privatization of utilities and the insurance company will require sustained effort.
Restructuring of public enterprises, most urgently HŽ, should also be given high priority.
The labor market needs to become more flexible to improve its stagnant performance.
These reforms will also help maintain competitiveness in the context of a stable exchange
rate.
57.
The financial sector is in good health and supervision has been improved, but
gaps remain. The CNB’s increased focus on the foreign exchange exposure of banks’
customers during on-site visits is welcome. The authorities should also close gaps in
nonbank financial supervision, improve cooperation between bank and nonbank and
domestic and foreign supervisors, considering the significant risk transfers from banks to
other financial institutions and the high degree of financial integration with the rest of the
world.
58.
The authorities need to improve economic statistics further. Despite the
progress made, important deficiencies remain in national accounts and balance of payments
statistics. These make monitoring and implementation of the government’s program more
difficult and need to be addressed urgently.

- 26 -

59.
Staff supports the authorities’ request for the new precautionary SBA. The
authorities have shown political commitment to their ambitious deficit targets for 2004–05.
The proposed program will control the quasi-fiscal operations and help improve
expenditure and debt management. Under these conditions, although both macroeconomic
uncertainties and implementation risks remain, the proposed program will help Croatia at
the beginning of its EU membership negotiations, underpin market confidence, and reduce
the risk of a crisis.
60.
It is proposed that Croatia remain on a 24-month consultation cycle as long as
the new SBA remains on track.

1/ Break in the series in 2002 due to a change in methodology of estimating the costs of insurance and freight, which led to an
upward revision of the current account deficit by 1.3 percent of GDP
2/ In 2003, it excludes debit entry of US$327.8 in the item "investment income" in the current account and an offsetting credit entry in
the item "FDI-reinvested earnings" of the capital account related to the "distribution" and "reinvestment" of paper income from the
revaluation of a patent by a Croatian company (see IMF Country Report No. 03/358, Appendix IV).
3/ In 2002, it excludes a debit entry of US$419.4 million in the item "direct investment abroad" and an offsetting credit entry in the
item "capital transfers" related to the revaluation and transfer of a patent by a Croatian company in exchange for the capital in a foreign
subsidiary (see IMF Country Report No. 03/358, Appendix IV).
4/ Errors and omissions are explicitly projected to reflect persistent unrecorded capital outflows.

Safeguards Assessment:
A new safeguards assessment of the CNB for a new SBA is under way.

VIII.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:
In December 1991, Croatia left the Yugoslav dinar area and adopted the Croatian
dinar as its sole legal tender. The Croatian dinar was replaced by the Croatian kuna

- 40 -

APPENDIX I

on May 30, 1994. The exchange rate of the kuna is determined by supply and
demand in the interbank market, with the participation of the CNB. The authorities’
exchange rate policy regarding the Croatian kuna is accordingly classified as
“managed floating with no pre-announced path for the exchange rate”. The CNB
transacts only in euros, U.S. dollars, and SDRs. On June 15, 2004, the official
exchange rate was kuna 6.1595 per U.S. dollar (middle rate).
IX.

Exchange Restrictions:
Croatia has accepted the obligations of Article VIII and maintains an exchange
system that is free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current
international transactions.

X.

Article IV Consultation and Recent Use of Fund Resources:
The last Article IV consultation with Croatia was concluded on August 5, 2002
(IMF Country Report No. 02/178). Executive Directors commended Croatia’s
strong economic performance but expressed concern about the still high fiscal
deficit, the rising public debt ratio, and delays in structural reforms. With the
approval of the Stand-By Arrangement on February 3, 2003, Croatia was
automatically placed on the 24-month consultation cycle, subject to the provisions
of the decision on consultation cycles (Decision No. 12794-(02/76), adopted
July 15, 2002).
On April 2, 2004, the 14-month Stand-By Arrangement for an amount equivalent
to SDR 105.88 million (29 percent of quota) expired. The authorities treated the
arrangement as precautionary. The first and second reviews were completed on
August 2, 2003 and November 12, 2003, respectively. Because of the slippages in
fiscal policy in late 2003 caused mainly by a pre-election spending surge, most
end-December performance criteria were not met, and the new government decided
to let the SBA expire without completing the third and final review, and start
discussions on a new precautionary SBA.
A 14-month Stand-By Arrangement in an amount equivalent to SDR 200 million
(55 percent of quota) expired on May 18, 2002. Performance under the program
was mixed. While its macroeconomic objectives were generally exceeded and most
quantitative performance criteria were observed, slippages occurred with respect to
structural performance criteria and benchmarks. No purchases were made under the
arrangement.

XI.

FSAP:
An FSAP was concluded with the completion of the 2002 Article IV consultation
on August 5, 2002 on the basis of missions that took place in April 2001 and

- 41 -

September 2001. The FSSA was published (IMF Country Report No. 02/180) and
the final FSAP report incorporating the AML/CFT assessment has been forwarded
to the authorities.

APPENDIX II

CROATIA: WORLD BANK RELATIONS
1.
The World Bank is taking the lead in assisting Croatia on structural and institutional
reforms in a number of sectors. These activities have been broadly aimed at: (i) reducing the level
of public expenditures and strengthen public expenditure and debt management; (ii) restructuring
the pension and health sectors; (iii) enhancing labor market flexibility; (iv) strengthening market
institutions and the competitiveness of the economy; (v) mitigating the social cost of reforms and
poverty through restructuring of social welfare programs; and (vi) beginning the process of judicial
reform. In support of this strategy, a US$202 million Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL) was
approved by the World Bank Board in December 2001 and the first tranche was disbursed in
February 2002. The second tranche was disbursed on October 24, 2003.
2.
A Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) focusing on European Integration issues were
published in July 2003. The findings of the CEM will underpin the design of a new CAS with a
tentative Board date in April 2004. A high-case scenario is likely to be centered on a potential
successor adjustment loan, a Programmatic Adjustment Loan (PAL). Preparatory work is
underway in designing this PAL, which will have three components: (i) governance (public
administration reform, legal and judiciary reform, local governance and public expenditure
management); (ii) investment climate (preparation of energy sector for EU integration,
restructuring/privatization of agro-combinates, tourist companies and shipyards, continued
reduction of barriers to entry of new firms, continued tightening of financial discipline of state
enterprises); (iii) building human capital and strengthening social protection (education, health and
social protection reforms). The identification mission for a potential PAL was conducted in MayJune 2004.
3.
Currently, there are eleven Bank active projects totaling US$447.6 million in Croatia: the
Reconstruction Project for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Srijem (US$40.6 million,
effective January 1999); the Municipal Environmental Infrastructure Project (US$36.3 million,
June 1999); the Railway Modernization and Restructuring Project (US$101 million, June 1999);
Technical Assistance II (US$7.3 million, August 1999); Health System Project (US$29 million,
March 2000); the Trade and Transport Facilitation in Southeast Europe (US$13.9 million,
May 2001); the Court and Bankruptcy Administration Project (US$5 million, January 2002); the
Pension System Investment Project (US$27.3 million, February 2003); the Real Property
Registration and Cadastre (US$25.7 million, February 2003); the Rijeka Gateway Project
(US$156.5 million, October 2003); the Energy Efficiency project (US$5 million, signed in
November 2003); and a GEF-financed US$7 million grant for the Energy Efficiency Project (also
signed in November 2003).
Investment projects under preparation include: the Coastal Cities Pollution Control
(approximately US$100 million), District Heating (approximately US$30 million), Social
Protection (approximately US$36 million), Social and Economic Recovery (approximately
US$24 million), and Science and Technology (approximately US$42 million).
4.

5.
As of September 2003, the IFC had 11 projects to 7 different entities in its portfolio for a
total of US$186.8 million (US$153.2 million for its own account).

- 43 -

APPENDIX III

CROATIA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Croatia’s economic and financial statistics are of mixed, though improving, quality.
Data on monetary aggregates are close to meeting the recommendations of the IMF’s
Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual. In other areas, however, there are major
deficiencies. In most cases, remedial action has been taken to improve data coverage and
reliability. But in some instances, progress has been impeded by insufficient resources and
lack of cooperation between government agencies. The recent creation of a joint committee
between the Ministry of Finance and the Croatian National Bank (CNB) should promote
collaboration in the statistical area to advance the reconciliation of government finance and
monetary data. Croatia has subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS)
and its metadata are posted on the Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB)
(http://dsbb.imf.org/Applications/web/dsbbhome/).
A. National Accounts
2.
The national accounts (NA) have undergone substantial improvements in the last few
years. The Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) compiles and publishes annual constant and
current price data according to the production, income, and expenditure approaches. On
June 30, 1999, the CBS began publishing quarterly GDP data by expenditure and main
industry groupings at current and constant (1997) prices, thus meeting the SDDS
requirements. Nonetheless, shortcomings remain. A substantial statistical discrepancy exists
between expenditure-based and value-added-based GDP data. This problem comes from: (i)
insufficient coordination between the CBS and CNB to reconcile their tourism receipts
estimates; (ii) incomplete coverage of unincorporated businesses and the self employed
(farmers, trade and crafts); (iii) inadequate data for measuring changes in inventories; (iv)
incomplete coverage of the informal sector; and (v) a lack of quarterly data for the seasonally
volatile agricultural sector. Other shortcomings include: (i) inadequate conversion of
government finance statistics from a cash to accruals basis; (ii) inadequate price deflators;
and (iii) the late publication of annual data, which generally show large differences with
quarterly data. After the abolition of the payments agency (ZAP) in late 2001, enterprise
financial statistics are collected by the finance agency (FINA). Further improvements are
currently being implemented and a new project for the production of regional GDP statistics
has been recently started.
B. Prices
3.
The CBS produces monthly indices of consumer and producer prices. Data are
collected around the 20th day of each month, and the indices are released by the10th of the
following month. Since January 2004, a new consumer price index (CPI) replaced the retail
price index (RPI). At the same time, the harmonized CPI will be calculated in line with
Eurostat methodology, but will not be released for the time being to avoid confusion. A core
CPI is also calculated based on a methodology developed by the CNB.

- 44 -

APPENDIX III

C. Wages and Employment
4.
Croatia produces data on average net and gross earnings per person in paid
employment by sector, and employment by sector. Earnings data include bonuses, sick pay,
and meal allowances, and are based on monthly surveys covering 70 percent of workers in
permanent employment in each industrial category. They do not cover a significant part of
the working population, including persons employed in trade and crafts, contract workers,
farmers, and military and police workers.
5.
The number of registered unemployed overstates the actual level of unemployment. A
preliminary Labor Force Survey, which meets ILO standards, was conducted for the first
time in 1996 on 7,200 households. The sample has been subsequently expanded and the
survey is now being conducted on a regular basis with semi-annual results released after a
delay of about four months. The difference between the survey-based unemployment rate and
that based on the registered unemployed has recently been reduced.
D. Fiscal Data
6.
Government finance statistics are produced on a monthly basis with lags of between
three and twelve weeks, and are available in the Monthly Statistical Review of the Ministry
of Finance or provided directly to the Fund. Revenue data on a GFS basis are reliable and
available on request on a next-day basis for most major categories for both the central budget
and the budgetary funds. Expenditure data on a cash basis are available according to GFS
methodology (economic and functional classification) for the central budget and the
budgetary funds. A new chart of accounts has been used to develop the budget for part of
general government entities since 2002. The data on central government financing in the
Ministry of Finance reports, the monetary survey, and the balance of payments are not
reconciled. Substantial discrepancies exist partly due to different methodologies and
definitions of government by the Ministry of Finance and the CNB. Following the
recommendations of the October 2002 GFS mission, a task force, comprising staff from
MOF, CNB, and CBS was formed to reconcile central government financing data produced
by these institutions. However, only irregular meetings have so far been held.
7.
Data on the stock of government debt suffer from certain deficiencies, although a new
CNB database represents a major improvement. The detailed data on domestic public bonds
published in the Monthly Statistical Review of the Ministry of Finance are now augmented
by a central government debt table in the CNB Monthly Bulletin, which also reports stocks of
central government guaranteed debt. The Ministry of Finance prepared a database with
government guarantees in July 2003, which has been used to monitor developments in the
stock and flows of guarantees. In addition, data on expenditure arrears—formally recorded,
for the first time at the end of 1999—promissory notes and receivable issues linked to banks
privatization are not included. The latest Monthly Statistical Review is for April 2004.
8.
Data on the operations of local governments and consolidated general government are
available only on a quarterly basis and with a lag of about one month. The Ministry of

- 45 -

APPENDIX III

Finance regularly reports monthly data for publication in the IFS and annual data for
publication in the GFS Yearbook.
E. Monetary Data
9.
Data on the monetary survey (including separate records for deposit money banks)
and the balance sheet of the CNB are published monthly with four- and two-week lags,
respectively, meeting the SDDS requirement. Key data, such as currency in circulation,
reserve deposits, and international reserves of the CNB are available on request with a oneday lag. A statistical reporting system that enables banks to report in a single set of forms
their balance sheets and income statements was introduced on July 1, 1999, together with a
new chart of accounts. In January 2004, the CNB introduced new statistical report forms and
a new chart of account for banks, reflecting the recommendations of the July 2001 monetary
and financial statistics mission on accrued interest and the international accounting standards
(IAS) 39 requirements.
10.
Following the recommendations of the July 2001 mission, attempts have been made
by the CNB and the Ministry of Finance to reconcile the monetary statistics and the
government finance statistics. However, data from the CNB on net credit to government
continue to be inconsistent with the Ministry of Finance’s data on the financing of
government from the CNB.
11.
As a subscriber to the SDDS, Croatia regularly disseminates the information on its
international reserves and foreign currency liquidity in a template according to the IMF
methodology. The data are disseminated monthly on the IMF and CNB external websites.
The CNB is planning to extend its statistical framework to balance sheet information of
investment funds and insurance companies. In March 2002, the CNB started to collect
financial information (balance sheets and investment structure) from investment and pension
funds; the data are not yet published, but used for internal purposes. However, the CNB’s
Bulletin (no. 83) informed the public on the other financial corporations’ development in the
financial system and presented selected aggregate data (e.g., net assets of investment and
pension funds). According to the CNB, the inclusion of other financial corporations in
monetary statistics depends on the harmonization process of the Croatian monetary statistics
with the statistical reporting requirements of the European Central Bank.
F. Banking Statistics
12.
Banks’ lending and deposit rates are published monthly in the CNB’s Bulletin. In
January 2002, rates on interbank loans and loans of banks to the central government, which
carried lower rates, were excluded. Thus, the average rate has increased, reflecting mainly
rates on overdrafts for households and enterprises. In addition, prior to January 2002, saving
banks’ rates on loans and deposits were not included. These changes have introduced a break
in the time series for banks’ lending and deposit rates.

G. Balance of Payments Data
13.
Balance of payments data are compiled on a quarterly basis according to the fifth
edition of the IMF’s Balance of Payments Manual and published by the CNB making use of
information from commercial banks, the CNB, and the Ministry of Finance, among other
entities. The data are generally available with a lag of two months and are subject to
substantial revisions in subsequent releases; however, trade data are available with a lag of
one month and data on international reserves are available the next day on request. In
January 1998, a major revision of balance of payments statistics took place which led to the
evaluation of imports on an f.o.b. basis and the inclusion of goods imported into free trade
zones. New surveys on transportation, travel, government services, and labor income were
introduced in 1999. The methodology on travel surveys was modified in 2002. The CNB
changed the methodology to estimate the cost of insurance and freight in early 2004. While
the survey of transportation delivers very accurate estimates, the other three surveys still need
improvements. In particular, the size of negative net errors and omissions has been around 3–
4 percent of GDP since 1999. This casts doubts about the accuracy of current account
estimates of the CNB. Also, since 1999, valuation changes have been excluded from the asset
side of currency and deposits in the banking sector. In mid-2001, new surveys on
communication and insurance services were introduced. During 1999 and 2000, the CNB
increased the coverage of the direct investment survey by identifying additional enterprises.
The coverage and quality of portfolio investment data are reasonably complete and accurate.
14.
The coverage of external debt data improved in 1999 with the publication of
information on external debt by debtor. A large part of Croatia’s external debt was contracted
prior to the dissolution of the former SFRY and Croatia’s share was agreed with Paris and
London Club creditors in 1995 and 1998, respectively. This information further improved
in 2000 with the introduction of the new CNB database. Foreign debt statistics are available
on request on the same day, but certain breakdowns (e.g., external public and publicly
guaranteed debt by creditors), loans received by the resident household sector, and credits
received with a maturity of less than 90 days are not covered in the standard reports. Also,
there is still a problem of identifying payments arrears. However, the authorities are in the
process of updating their database for earlier years in order to identify genuine arrears, if any,
and record them in the balance of payments.
15.
Annual data on the international investment position are disseminated on the CNB
website with a six-month lag.

APPENDIX IV

CROATIA: SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
1.
Fiscal and external debt sustainability assessments were conducted over the medium
term applying standardized sensitivity tests to the staff’s central scenario.
H. Fiscal Sustainability
2.
Stress testing of debt dynamics under different scenarios suggests that fiscal
sustainability is not seriously at risk, although a severe economic slowdown accompanied by
a proportional drop in revenues could put the debt ratio temporarily on an upward trend.
According to staff’s central scenario, the debt ratio stabilizes slightly below 42 percent of
GDP in 2004 and subsequently falls to 36½ percent of GDP by 2009 driven primarily by
continued fiscal consolidation and supported by privatizations. If key variables are kept at
their historical averages (scenario A1) the debt ratio increases by around 5 percent of GDP
by 2009. This is mainly because the historical primary deficit is significantly above the
projected deficit in the central scenario. Turning to the boundary tests (scenarios B1-B6), the
debt ratio in all cases resumes a downward trend following the initial shock. The only
exception is the case of a significant drop in economic activity (scenario B2), which gives
rise to a significant worsening of debt dynamics assuming that revenues fall in line with
GDP.
I. External Sustainability
3.
Under the staff’s central scenario, the external debt to GDP ratio falls from about
76¾ percent (in euro terms) in 2004 to 72¾ percent in 2009 (Table 15)7. Three alternative
scenarios (A1-A3) are considered. Under the first scenario, the main parameters (interest
rate, Croatian terms of trade, non-interest current account, and non-debt creating flows as
a percentage of GDP) are at the historical average. Under the second scenario, Croatian GDP
growth in 2005 is -1 percent due mainly to a drop in exports of goods and tourism receipts.
The third scenario assumes GDP growth and current account balance based on the consensus
forecast of the three largest banks in Croatia. As Table 15 demonstrates, under alternative
scenarios, the debt to GDP ratio does not exceed 81 percent of GDP. The boundary shocks
yield more adverse results. Croatia withstands relatively well the shocks to interest rates, real
GDP growth, terms of trade shock and non-interest current account (tests B1- B4). The
combination of various shocks (B5), as well as a 30 percent depreciation of the Kuna against
the U.S. dollar (B6) result in the debt to GDP ratio of more than 100 percent.

7

This appendix calculates debt to GDP ratio as euro value of debt to euro value of GDP.
When the ratio calculated as Kuna value of external debt to Kuna GDP the results are very
similar with the debt falling from 76.8 percent to 72.7 percent of GDP by 2009 (Table 15).

APPENDIX V

CROATIA: RECENT TRENDS IN COMPETITIVENESS INDICATORS AND COMPETITIVENESS
OF THE CROATIAN TOURISM SECTOR
1.
A study on Croatian competitiveness conducted for the 2002 Article IV consultation
concluded that Croatian export performance in recent years had been mixed. While exports
of goods lagged compared to most Central and Eastern European countries (CEECs), exports
of services, in particular in transportation and tourism, had grown vigorously8. The real
effective exchange rate (REER) and unit labor cost (ULC) indicators of external
competitiveness did not show deterioration of Croatia’s external competitiveness. The study
concluded that the relatively high growth of exports of services compared to other CEECs
suggested that Croatia may have a comparative advantage in services exports because of
nature and location (e.g., transport and tourism). But the growth of merchandise exports was
too low compared to other CEEC countries and the industrial wage level was relatively high.
2.
The updated competitiveness indicators suggest that the above trends have continued.
In 2000–03, the overall growth of exports of goods and non-factor services was
40½ percent—well below the average of about 60 percent in the CEECs, and growth of
merchandise exports—only 12½ percent—among the lowest (Table 16). At the same time,
growth of exports of services (mainly tourism) was close to 70 percent—among the highest
in the group. Similar to the conclusions of the 2002 study, industrial wages continued to be
relatively high, but the gap with the competitors has narrowed (Table 17), and REER and
ULC indicators (Box 1) do not show deterioration of external competitiveness.
Competitiveness of the Croatian Tourism Sector
3.
The Croatian tourism sector is one of the most important in the Croatian economy.
Surpluses in tourism services partially offset a persistently large merchandise trade deficit.
4.
How competitive is the Croatian tourism sector compared with those in other
countries with popular tourist destinations, in particular those with access to the
Mediterranean and the Black Sea? The competitiveness of the tourism sector is much more
difficult to gauge than that of manufacturing industry, both because each tourist destination
differs from others and because the quality of tourist services depends on a variety of
factors—among them infrastructure, environment, openness of trade, culture of the country,
and overall social development. The World Travel and Tourism Council—an international
forum of the tourism industry—calculates several competitiveness indices reflecting these
factors for more than 200 countries (Box 1).
5.
Table 18 presents these indices for Croatia and some other countries with popular
tourist destinations. It demonstrates that Croatia compares favorably with other European
8

countries with the access to the Mediterranean and the Black Sea in the price of tourism
services and the quality of environment, on par in human resource quality, but lags in
technology and openness compared to the more advanced EU countries. Overall, the
indicators show Croatia’s tourism sector to be competitive with good prospects, which is
consistent with the growth in tourist receipts in recent years. The prospects can be further
improved by advancing the technological sophistication of tourist facilities and further
increasing openness. The government of Croatia has worked with the World Travel and
Tourism Council to design a strategy for tourism that sets out an action plan for the
development of the sector, and this strategy is now in the implementation phase.
Box 1. World Travel and Tourism Council: Indicators of Competitiveness
The World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) is a forum of tourism industry professionals comprising
the presidents, chairs, and CEOs of 100 of the world's important tourism companies. The WTTC
calculates a broad range of indicators of competitiveness indices for over 200 countries.
The Price Competitiveness index is a weighted average of hotel price index, the purchasing power
parity index, adjusted consumer price index, and taxes on goods and services.
The Infrastructure index measures the competitiveness of infrastructure and is calculated using
information on road quality, access to improved sanitation facilities, access to improved drinking water,
and the railways.
The Environment index is calculated using population density, carbon emissions, and the degree of
government’s ratification of environmental treaties.
The Openness index takes into account tourism openness using data including visa requirements, the
extent to which a country is open to international tourism, trade openness, and taxes on international
trade.
The Social Development index measures a country’s development in social issues using data on
population access to daily newspapers, personal computers, television sets, and criminality.
The Human Resource index measures the quality of human resources in each country. It is calculated
using data regarding life expectancy, literacy rates, education, employment, population, training, skills,
and gender equality indicators.

ATTACHMENT I

Zagreb, 13 July, 2004

Mr. Rodrigo de Rato
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431
U.S.A.
Dear Mr. de Rato:
We have prepared an economic policy program for 2004 and 2005 to limit external
vulnerability arising from the high current account deficit and the heavy external debt burden,
and prepare Croatia for EU accession. To achieve these objectives, our program relies on fiscal
adjustment to stabilize the external debt-to-GDP ratio at approximately its present level, and
structural reforms to reduce the role of the state in the economy and promote private sector
activity. In support of our program and to signal our commitment to strong macroeconomic
policies, we herewith request a Stand-By Arrangement in an amount of SDR 97 million
(26.7 percent of quota) for a 20-month period starting from Board approval.
The implementation of our program, which is described in the attached Memorandum
on Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) and Technical Memorandum of Understanding
(TMU), will be monitored through quantitative performance criteria, indicative targets, and
structural benchmarks. Our fiscal program will be monitored by performance criteria on the
general government and HBOR deficits, the change in the stock of general government arrears,
the contracting of new nonconcessional external debt of the general government and HBOR,
and the cumulative issuance of debt guarantees by the general government. To ensure that the
operations of public enterprises will not jeopardize fiscal consolidation and to increase
transparency, the deficits of selected public enterprises, net of budget transfers, will also be
monitored on the basis of indicative targets. The implementation of the CNB’s monetary
program will be monitored through performance criteria on the net international reserves and
net domestic assets of the CNB.
The MEFP proposes performance criteria and indicative targets for end-September and
end December 2004. There will be two reviews during the period of the requested arrangement,
before the third and sixth purchases, respectively, to assess progress in implementing the
program and reach understandings on any additional measures that may be needed to achieve
its objectives. The first review will focus in particular on the 2005 budget. Program
implementation will also be monitored through a structural performance criterion on the
preparation of 3-year rolling budgets starting in 2005 and structural benchmarks.
We believe that the policies and measures set forth in the MEFP and the TMU are
sufficient to attain the objectives of our economic program. However, we stand ready to take

- 57 -

ATTACHMENT I

any further measures that may be needed toward this end. We will consult periodically with the
Fund, in accordance with the Fund’s policies on such consultations, about the progress being
made in implementing our economic program, and in advance of any revisions to the policies
covered by the MEFP. We will provide the Fund with such information as it requests on policy
implementation and achievement of program objectives.
In view of Croatia’s comfortable international reserves position and easy access to
international capital markets, we intend to treat the arrangement as precautionary. Therefore,
we do not intend to make the purchases under the requested arrangement that will become
available upon its approval and after observance of its performance criteria and completion of
its reviews.

Sincerely yours,

ATTACHMENT I

MEMORANDUM ON ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES

1.
Croatia is a functioning market economy with a well-established track record of
satisfactory growth and low inflation. Real GDP growth has averaged 4½ percent with
inflation in the low single digits since the mid-1990s, the economy is open to the rest of the
world, foreign investment is strong, and structural reform has advanced over a wide front. This
performance compares favorably to that in other countries in the region and has provided the
basis for the recent positive avis by the European Commission, which recommended opening
negotiations for EU membership with our country.
But certain structural problems have long been left unaddressed and our
2.
government is starting with a heavy burden from the past. This burden is reflected in two
features of our economy. First, the public sector is large and inefficient: the share of public
spending to GDP is higher than in other countries at a similar level of development; public
agencies and enterprises are not subject to strict financial discipline; state aid in various forms
is higher than in the rest of Central and Eastern Europe—indeed above the average in the EU;
and the fiscal deficit last year was very high. And second, public and private external debt has
reached high levels, exposing Croatia to significant risks.

3.
Addressing the underlying causes and alleviating this burden is critical for the
health of our economy and for an early and successful entry into the EU, which is our
primary strategic objective. The government and the Croatian National Bank (CNB), with the
support of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), have thus cooperated in the design of an
economic policy program with two main goals:
•

in the short term, restoring order in Croatia’s public finances and limiting the
vulnerability arising from the high current account and external debt burden; and

•

in the medium term, modernizing and reducing the role of the state, promoting private
sector activity, and preparing Croatia to compete within the EU.

These goals are complementary: the long-term competitiveness and growth of our economy
and, in particular, the accession to the EU require a stable macroeconomic environment and a
low fiscal deficit. This Memorandum presents the policies that we believe will achieve these
goals and is an integral part of our government’s broader economic and social program.
Although it focuses on the period immediately ahead, it also incorporates policies that have a
longer time horizon and will require consistent implementation in the coming years.
Our program will be monitored by quarterly performance criteria, indicative
4.
targets, and structural benchmarks specified and defined in the attached Technical
Memorandum of Understanding.
V. MACROECONOMIC POLICIES FOR 2004–05

5.
The immediate objective of macroeconomic policies for 2004–05 is to reduce
external vulnerability. Croatia is a small open economy operating in an uncertain international

- 59 -

ATTACHMENT I

environment. Heavy foreign borrowing by both the public and the private sectors in the last
decade has resulted in a very high foreign debt to GDP ratio (77 percent of GDP at endMay 2004 in euro terms). Although foreign borrowing is likely to continue as our economy
invests in the future, the size of the current account deficit and foreign debt makes Croatia
vulnerable to external shocks and shifts in market sentiment: for example, tourism receipts may
fluctuate substantially in reaction to international events, while foreign borrowing by domestic
banks and enterprises can be very volatile. Our immediate objective therefore is to contain the
external current account imbalance and reduce sharply the reliance on foreign borrowing.
Fiscal policy is the main instrument to achieve this objective. The external
6.
imbalance can only be addressed by a lasting reduction in the domestic saving-investment gap.
Given its focus on exchange rate stability, monetary policy can only play a supporting role; the
burden for narrowing the saving-investment gap falls on fiscal policy. The fiscal effort will
encompass not only the central government but also extra-budgetary funds and agencies, the
broader public sector, and the Croatian Development Bank (HBOR).

7.
Our fiscal targets for 2004 and 2005 are also guided by the need to restore
credibility and set fiscal policy on a course that meets EU requirements in the medium
term. A sizable fiscal adjustment is needed in order to reverse the excesses of last year, when
spending slippages by the previous government in the last quarter of the year resulted in a
widening of the general government deficit to 6.3 percent of GDP (including hidden subsidies
to Croatian Railways—see ¶9), missing the 2003 budget target by a wide margin and taking the
previous Stand-By Arrangement with the IMF off track. At the same time, we intend to
continue critical infrastructure projects and provide budgetary room for the costs associated
with the process of harmonization with the EU.
Achieving the main short-term objective of our program will be facilitated by the
8.
return of the pace of economic growth to a more sustainable level. The unwinding of the
credit boom and the restoration of fiscal discipline are expected to maintain real GDP growth to
3½–3¾ percent and keep the current account deficit around 5–5½ percent of GDP in 2004–05.
Inflation will remain at the range of 2–3 percent per year. Given this economic outlook, we
expect the policies for 2004–05 outlined in this Memorandum will result in stabilizing the
external debt-to-GDP ratio at around its end-May 2004 level. If developments during the
program period indicate a significant deviation from our macroeconomic objectives, in
particular a sizeable increase in the external debt-to-GDP ratio net of official and commercial
bank reserves, we will adjust macroeconomic policies, in particular fiscal policy, to achieve our
targets.
A. Fiscal Policy

9.
The first task of our government this year was to deal with the lack of transparent
accounting and accumulated fiscal obligations inherited from 2003. First, the deficits
reported in 2002 and 2003 had been artificially suppressed because the previous government
had forced the loss-making Croatian Railways (HŽ) to finance part of its spending by
government-guaranteed short-term loans, which were planned to be taken over and serviced by
the budget this year. We have discontinued this practice and our budget now includes all

- 60 -

ATTACHMENT I

transfers required by HŽ to finance both capital and current spending. And second,
expenditures in 2004 are burdened by a number of one-off obligations inherited from last year,
including hospital arrears, wage arrears, and contracts for housing reconstruction that amount to
about HRK 800 million (0.4 percent of GDP), as well as the impact of substantial wage
increases awarded to civil servants by the previous government one month before the last
November elections.
Against this background, the main objective of fiscal policy in 2004 is to restore
10.
transparency and order in our public finances and begin the process of medium-term
consolidation. We aim at a general government deficit of HRK 9.3 billion (4½ percent of
GDP) on a GFS 2001 basis including net lending, an adjustment of 1.8 percent of GDP
from 2003. This target was set in the 2004 budget, prepared by our government and approved
in March, and is supported by a set of additional measures in a supplementary budget that we
have submitted to parliament for approval by July 15.
To achieve this major adjustment, we rely on a combination of expenditure and
11.
revenue measures, as well as some one-off revenues. An adjustment of this magnitude could
not be achieved by permanent measures alone, especially given the inherited obligations
from 2003 and the fact that a quarter of the year had elapsed before the budget could be
approved. Our budget and supplementary budget include a number of permanent measures:
•

No increase in real terms in the wage bill, to be achieved despite the higher wage
payments through the ongoing rationalization of the defense sector;

•

Savings of about HRK 700 million as spending on highway and road construction
return to more reasonable levels;

•

A reduction in the statutory limit to local government borrowing from 3 percent to
2 percent of last year’s annual revenue.

•

Measures to improve spending control in the health sector and prevent the re-emergence
of significant payments arrears by hospitals, notably introducing expenditure planning
and reporting by hospitals on a monthly basis, limiting the number of prescriptions per
doctor refunded by the Health Institute, introducing a tender system for the procurement
of the most expensive drugs, and benchmarking domestic drug prices to the average of
the 5 lowest-cost EU members;

•

Additional revenue of HRK 200 million from higher excises on cars and tobacco that
will take effect on July 15;

•

The re-introduction of the Financial Police, which will improve tax compliance and lead
to better collections (although most of this impact will be felt starting in 2005).

Moreover, we expect HRK 2.1 billion from additional dividend payments from a number of
public enterprises and higher-than-planned receipts from the concession of the third GSM

- 61 -

ATTACHMENT I

license. Finally, we will reduce the annual lending plan of HBOR, which is essentially an arm
of government policy, by HRK 200 million by a decision of its Supervisory Board by July 23.
We are firmly committed to achieving this deficit target in 2004 and stand ready to
12.
take additional measures if necessary. To safeguard our target, we plan to use any receipts
from privatization or succession agreements beyond what is currently budgeted to reduce
foreign debt rather than finance spending. If our measures in the health area do not achieve the
intended objectives, we will increase co-payments for medical services and drugs, reduce the
number of exemptions from co-payments, and introduce changes to the supplementary health
insurance scheme to reduce outlays by November 1.
The 2005 budget will aim at a general government deficit of 3.7 percent of GDP,
13.
with continued effort to limit HBOR’s net lending. To achieve this objective, we intend to
contain the general government wage bill growth to no more than the rate of inflation; lower
further investment on roads and highways in the context of the new four-year plans of the
Highway and Road Agencies (HAC and HC); contain health system spending further on the
basis of the measures taken in 2004; and reduce administrative costs of the Health, Pension,
and Employment Funds. At the same time, we will have to start meeting the costs associated
with harmonization with the acquis communautaire in the context of EU membership
negotiations, which we expect to begin soon, as well as provide additional resources to the
priority sectors of education and the judiciary. All told, we intend to lower general government
current spending-to-GDP ratio by about 1 percentage point and total spending and net lending
by 1¾ percentage point. These measures, together with the full-year effect of the higher excises
on cars and tobacco and the impact of the Financial Police on collection, will offset at least half
of the loss of this year’s one-off revenues. We also plan to reduce HBOR’s lending plans by an
additional HRK 200 million compared to 2004.

14.
Next year, we also intend to start the medium-term process of tax reform. Our
government believes that the relatively high tax burden, particularly on capital and labor, acts
as a break on Croatia’s growth. Given the urgent need to restore order in our public finances,
we have postponed the VAT rate reduction initially planned for 2005. But we are considering a
number of changes with a view to reducing distortions, improving incentives, broadening the
base, and supporting low-income earners, such as eliminating a number of personal income tax
exemptions, reducing some tax rates, simplifying the taxation of reinvested profits, and
reducing the number of goods subject to zero VAT rate. These or any other tax reforms in 2005
will be revenue-neutral so as not to jeopardize our overall deficit target.
15.
Budget financing will gradually shift to domestic sources. This would reduce the
government’s exposure to exchange rate risk, boost the development of the domestic capital
market, and may help absorb excess liquidity in the private sector. We aim at raising at least
HRK 2 billion of domestic financing this year (about one-third of the general government’s
borrowing requirement), and raise this proportion in the coming years. Specifically, we will
cancel the issuance of a new Samurai Bond planned for 2004 and postpone the syndicated
foreign loan planned by HBOR in the fourth quarter. As regards 2005, we intend to shift the
bulk of both central government and HAC and HC borrowing to domestic sources.

16.
We will limit the issuance of new government debt guarantees. The outstanding
stock of debt guarantees to entities outside the general government (including guarantees issued
for HBOR loans) has grown to some HRK 19 billion (almost 10 percent of GDP). We will limit
the issuance of new debt guarantees to a level of HRK 2.2 billion in 2004, with a view to
keeping the stock of outstanding guarantees broadly constant at its present level during this
year and gradually reducing it over the medium term.
Finally, we intend to strengthen financial discipline and improve the performance
17.
of public enterprises. The recent transactions by HŽ highlight the soft budget constraint under
which public enterprises operate. We intend to cover all of HŽ’s financing needs for operating
and investment expenditures from the budget and finalize by end-December 2004 a mediumterm business plan that will return the company on a sound financial footing. We are seeking
the assistance of the World Bank in this area. We also intend to continue restructuring the stateowned shipyards, with a view to reducing their reliance on the budget and preparing them for
privatization. Finally, we will continue the restructuring efforts in key public enterprises,
notably Croatian Forests and the shipping company Jadrolinija, with a view to improving asset
management, reducing personnel, and preparing these enterprises for privatization. To ensure
that the public enterprise sector as a whole continues to improve its aggregate financial
position, we will impose limits on the total borrowing of 8 large public enterprises for 2004
and 2005.
B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy

18.
The CNB has a secondary but nonetheless important role in reducing external
vulnerability. Given the openness of the economy, strong trade links with the euro area, large
capital flows, and limited hedging opportunities for kuna holders, the CNB intends to pursue its
price stability mandate by continuing to maintain the exchange rate of the kuna broadly stable
against the euro. Coupled with the high degree of integration of Croatian banks and corporates
with the international capital market, this limits the ability of the CNB to affect the level of
economic activity, the current account deficit, and foreign debt.
19.
For the remainder of this year, the CNB will pursue its announced monetary
policy targets. CNB’s monetary program for 2004 targets reserve and broad money growth at
about 8–9 percent. Gross official reserves at end-2004 are projected at HRK 47 billion
(equivalent to 4½ months of following year’s imports of goods & nonfactor services or close
to 200 percent of following year’s maturing external debt), a level that we judge to be adequate
for maintaining confidence in our policies. To achieve these targets and signal its commitment
to the external objectives of the program, the CNB introduced as of July 1 a new marginal
reserve requirement on borrowing from non-residents, to be kept with the CNB, and intends to
maintain its Net Domestic Assets (NDA) below the level of HRK -3 billion for the remainder
of the year. In the event of higher-than-expected capital inflows (aside from the usual seasonal
fluctuations), the CNB will intervene in order to maintain broad exchange rate stability. Should
liquidity in the system increase excessively or the balance of payments weaken significantly,
the CNB will resume issuing CNB bills during the course of the year in order to meet the
reserve targets under the program. In the event that massive private capital inflows threaten to

- 63 -

ATTACHMENT I

undermine macroeconomic stability, the CNB will consider, in consultation with the IMF,
introducing price-based controls on capital movements.
By the end of this year, the CNB, in cooperation with the Ministry of Finance, will
20.
establish technical prerequisites for the introduction of open market operations. To
facilitate the shift towards domestic financing of the government and develop the domestic
financial market, we will work on establishing the necessary technical preconditions for the
introduction of open market operations with government paper. In particular, the Ministry of
Finance will complete the transfer of the Treasury bill registry to the Central Depository
Agency by end-July 2004 and ensure that the registry is fully operational; and the CNB intends
to begin open market operations by end-2004 and will implement delivery versus payment in
real time by end-March 2005 at the latest. Both the CNB and the Ministry of Finance recognize
the need for a close coordination on these issues.
C. Structural Reforms

21.
Structural reforms are a key part of our program in order both to supplement our
macroeconomic policies and to prepare our economy for EU accession. Most of these
measures require consistent implementation over time and will only bear fruit in the medium
and long term. But they are an important part of our vision for the Croatian economy because
they will raise the long-term potential growth rate and prepare the country for competing within
the EU. Moreover, some of these measures will facilitate the achievement of our short-term
macroeconomic objectives. These reforms are thus a critical part of our program also for 2004–
05, and most of them are incorporated in a three-year Programmatic Adjustment Loan (PAL)
from the World Bank, expected to be agreed in early 2005.
Public finance reforms

22.
There is an urgent need to enhance transparency and efficiency in public
expenditure and debt management. The recent fiscal ROSC mission with the IMF and the
World Bank-IMF technical assistance mission on public debt management have helped identify
the major weaknesses in these areas. During the next 18 months, we intend to:
•

make the single treasury account fully operational by eliminating bank accounts of the
Deposit Insurance and Bank Rehabilitation Agency (DAB) by end-June 2005, the
Privatization Fund (HFP) by end-September 2005 and the Highway and Road funds
(HAC and HC) by end-December 2005, as well as introducing commitments-based
reporting;

•

prepare an action plan by end-October 2004 to implement the recommendations of the
fiscal ROSC report currently under preparation;

•

strengthen public debt management by appointing by end-June this year the Steering
Committee that will oversee the implementation of improvement measures;
restructuring the Debt Management department by end-September and strengthening

- 64 -

ATTACHMENT I

staff and training by year-end; enhancing software support by end-August; and,
following the recommendations of the IT expert and with support by the EU CARDS
program, decide on a permanent software solution for debt management by end-2004;
•

complete by end-2004 the register of government debt guarantees, including guarantees
by local governments, and reconcile data with the CNB;

We plan to set the annual budgets in the context of a medium-term fiscal policy
23.
framework. A detailed, multi-year policy framework, with annual targets for the major
expenditure programs and the policies to achieve these, would be the linchpin of our fiscal
policy. It would inform public debate, illustrate policy tradeoffs, and allow making strategic
choices rationally. It will also allow us to plan our medium-term tax and spending reforms with
a view to achieving a substantial reduction in the share of government spending to GDP. Such a
framework will also be necessary once negotiations with the EU start. As a first step, the
government will prepare rolling three-year budgets starting with the preparation of the 2005
budget.

24.
The government is committed to ensuring the long-term sustainability of the
pension system. The recent change in the pension indexation formula, on which we will seek a
formal interpretation by parliament by July 15, 2004, links pension increases to the change in
average real wages in the economy. This will ensure that the share of pension spending to GDP
continues to decline in the medium-term. We intend to honor the 1998 Constitutional Court
decision on “pensioners’ debt” to the extent it has not been covered by subsequent laws. To
ensure a solution that is consistent with the country’s ability to afford such payments, we have
decided to use only state shares in enterprises or other types of equity. We plan to consult with
the staff of the IMF and the World Bank before determining the details of this solution and
moving to the implementation stage. More generally, we are strongly committed to reviewing
all aspects of the pension system and continuing the reform process, in order to maintain its
financial sustainability, stimulate private savings, and encourage financial market
developments.
Privatization

25.
We will restore momentum in the privatization process. Privatization will enhance
the economic efficiency and growth potential over the medium term and help reduce foreign
debt. The HFP aims at privatizing all companies in which the government holds a share of up to
25 percent by year-end and all remaining holdings in its portfolio by end-June 2005. Outside
HFP’s portfolio, we will resume efforts to restructure and privatize large state enterprises. In
particular, the government will sell at least 15 percent of the oil company (INA) by end-2005
and will formulate the plan on privatization of the insurance company (CO) by end-June 2005
and complete the third phase of privatization of the telecommunication company (HT) by endDecember 2005. Finally, the government will disengage from Croatia Banka by end-June 2005
and consider the options for privatization or a strategic partnership for HPB.

- 65 -

ATTACHMENT I

Other structural reforms

26.
Finally, the government will take steps to improve the business environment,
financial sector supervision, and statistics.
•

In the context of the World Bank PAL, we will implement reforms in the judiciary
(including improving and computerizing the operation of courts, training court
personnel, improving the operation of the cadastre and eliminating backlogs in land
registration) and in public administration (including reforming the salary scale and
introducing performance-related pay).

•

The government intends to unify the supervision of nonbank financial intermediaries. In
this context, it will appoint a Working Group by September 2004 to prepare this
ambitious reform, and draft new laws on insurance and on investment funds to be
adopted by end-2005.

•

The CNB will step up its efforts to supervise banks’ credit risk resulting from their
borrowers’ exposure in foreign exchange.

•

We will make additional efforts to improve balance of payments statistics, where
serious deficiencies hamper the analysis of external developments. We intend to request
technical assistance from the IMF to help address this urgent problem.

Under our program, we will not impose or intensify restrictions on the making of
27.
payments and transfers for current international transactions, introduce or modify multiple
currency practices, conclude bilateral payments agreements that are inconsistent with
Article VIII of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, or impose or intensify import restrictions for
balance of payments purposes, nor will we accumulate external payments arrears.

For program purposes, the term “debt” is understood to mean a current, i.e., not
8.
contingent, liability, created under a contractual arrangement through the provision of value in
the form of assets (including currency) or services, and which requires the obligor to make one
or more payments in the form of assets (including currency) or services at some future points in
time; these payments will discharge the principal and/or interest liabilities under the contract.
(For details of definition of debt, refer to “Guidelines on Performance Criteria with respect to
External Debt in Fund Arrangements” (IMF Executive Board Decision No. 12278—[00/86],
August 25, 2000).
The limits on short-term debt do not apply to normal import-related credits and
9.
nonresident deposits in state-owned banks (HPB, HBOR).
10.
Concessional loans are defined as those with a grant element of at least 35 percent,
using currency-specific discount rates based on the six-month average commercial interest rates
reported by the OECD (CIRRs) for loans with maturities of less than 15 years, and on the 10year average CIRRs for loans with maturities of 15 years and more.

minus off-balance sheet foreign currency obligations.
For purposes of the program, gross foreign assets shall be defined as monetary gold,
20.
holdings of SDRs, any reserve position in the IMF, and holdings of foreign exchange in
convertible currencies by the CNB. Any return to the CNB of blocked foreign assets that are
not part of CNB foreign assets as of December 31, 2003 will be added to the reserve floor.
Reserves that are pledged, frozen or used as collateral shall be excluded from the gross foreign
assets. In particular, any reserve assets pledged to secure government debt will be excluded
from the reserves definition.

For purposes of the program, reserve liabilities shall be defined as all liabilities of the
21.
CNB to non-residents—excluding deposits into the special accounts for external debt
servicing—with an original maturity of up to and including one year, as well as liabilities
arising from IMF purchases and bridge loans from the BIS, irrespective of their maturity. For
purposes of the program, reserve liabilities shall also include guarantees provided by the CNB
backed by reserves as collateral.
22.
The net forward position of the CNB is defined as the difference between the face
value of foreign currency-denominated CNB off-balance sheet claims on nonresidents
(forwards, swaps, options, and futures market contracts) and foreign currency obligations to
both residents and nonresidents. This position was zero on December 31, 2003. For program
purposes, only the off-balance sheet obligations will be deducted from the CNB’s net
international reserves position. These liabilities amounted to zero on December 31, 2003.
For the purpose of program monitoring, the stock of reserve assets and liabilities for
23.
each quarter in question will be valued in euro at the exchange rates specified in Section IV.
24.
For purposes of the program, the end-of-quarter net international reserves of the CNB
are calculated as the arithmetic average of 11 observations centered on the last business day of
each quarter.
The limits will be monitored from data on the accounts of the CNB supplied monthly
25.
to the Fund by the CNB within 15 days of the last business day included in the observations.

IMF Concludes 2004 Article IV Consultation with the Republic of Croatia
On August, 4, 2004, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with the Republic of Croatia.1
Background
Croatia has established a record of solid growth and low inflation since the mid-1990s: real GDP
growth has averaged about 4.5 percent with inflation in the low single digits. This performance
compares well with the EU-15 and other Central and Eastern European countries (CEECs).
Structural reform has also advanced and the private sector is vibrant, although Croatia lags
behind CEECs in terms of overall progress in this area, partly due to the war and disruptions in
the early 1990s. This record has provided the basis for the recent decision by the Council of the
European Union to grant candidate status to Croatia and start accession negotiations in
early 2005.
This performance, however, was accompanied by a gradual worsening of the external position.
Domestic investment has outpaced savings since the mid-1990s, resulting in persistent current
account deficits. These trends accelerated after the turn of the decade due to a credit-financed
surge in private domestic demand in 2001–02, and the current account deficit reached about
8.5 percent of GDP in 2002. As a result and despite Croatia’s ability to attract high foreign direct
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities and this PIN summarizes the views of the Executive Board.

-2investment (FDI) compared with other CEECs, private and public external debt gradually
increased, facilitated by an investment grade rating and low world interest rates and spreads.
Although domestic demand pressures began to ease in the second half of 2003, fiscal discipline
waned in the runup to the November elections. Both capital and current spending—particularly
on highway construction, went significantly over budget, and there were sizeable off-budget
fiscal operations, notably hidden subsidies to the Croatian Railways in the form of
government-guaranteed loans. As a result, the fiscal deficit reached 6.3 percent of GDP in 2003
compared with the target of 4.5 percent, derailing the last Stand-By Arrangement. Monetary
policy could only play a limited role due to the Croatian National Bank’s (CNB) choice of
exchange rate stability, the open capital account, and high degree of euroization. The CNB
resorted to direct credit controls in January 2003. Although this may have dampened spending
by households that do not have easy access to foreign borrowing, corporations were able to
switch their borrowing from domestic to foreign borrowing and leasing.
Despite the fiscal relaxation and the largely unsuccessful effort of the CNB to control aggregate
demand, bumper tourist receipts and the slowing of private consumption eased balance of
payment pressures last year and the current account deficit declined to 6 percent of GDP.
Due to continuing high capital inflows, however, external debt continued to increase, reaching
about 74.5 percent of GDP in euro terms at end-2003. These trends have continued thus far
in 2004: bank credit and import data confirm the moderate pace of aggregate demand and
preliminary first quarter national accounts show a pickup in net exports. However, reflecting
seasonally high financing needs, external debt rose further to 77 percent of GDP at end-May.
The new government, which has been in office since January, has resumed the fiscal
consolidation effort, aiming at a general government deficit of 4.5 percent of GDP in 2004 and
3.7 percent in 2005, with a view to containing the external imbalance and keeping the external
debt-to-GDP ratio broadly stable during these two years. The government also took steps to
improve transparency in the fiscal accounts, rein in quasi-fiscal operations, and strengthen
public expenditure and debt management. The CNB intends to continue playing a supporting
role, managing closely domestic bank liquidity, and working with the Finance Ministry to
introduce open market operations to facilitate the planned shift of government financing to
domestic sources. To support their policies for 2004-05, the authorities have requested a
new 20-month Stand-By Arrangement, which they intend to treat as precautionary.
Executive Board Assessment
Croatia’s economic growth and inflation performance since the mid-1990s compares well with
the CEECs, the economy is open, and structural reform is advanced—although Croatia still lags
other CEECs in this area. This overall performance had contributed to the recent decision by
the Council of the European Union to grant candidate status to Croatia and start accession
negotiations in early 2005. While recognizing these achievements, Directors expressed concern
over the persistently wide current account deficits and rising external debt-to-GDP ratio, which
have over time increased significantly Croatia’s external vulnerability.

-3Directors supported the authorities’ overall strategy to deal with external vulnerability mainly
through renewed fiscal consolidation. Most Directors agreed that the choice of a broadly stable
exchange rate regime remained suitable for Croatia, provided that supporting policies are in
place and the level of the exchange rate continues to promote competitiveness.
Some suggested, however, that the appropriateness of the exchange rate regime should be
reassessed as circumstances change.
Directors considered the envisaged fiscal adjustment for 2004–05 to be significant, but
questioned its composition. A total fiscal and quasi-fiscal adjustment of 2¾ percentage points of
GDP, while ambitious, was the minimum required to stabilize the external debt-to-GDP ratio
around its current level by the end of 2005, in the context of the projected moderation of private
domestic demand pressures. Directors commended the government’s decision to postpone the
reduction of VAT rates planned for 2005. However, they pointed to the need to further curtail
current spending, which is high relative to other similar countries. They also regretted the
reliance on one-off revenue measures in 2004, although they recognized that this was a
response to the inherited burden from 2003 and the size of the planned adjustment.
Directors cautioned that the authorities should be ready to take additional measures if the
envisaged adjustment proves insufficient to reduce external vulnerability.
Directors welcomed the measures to enhance fiscal transparency and improve public
expenditure and debt management. Weaknesses in these areas were major factors behind the
sharp deterioration in the fiscal stance which derailed the previous Stand-By Arrangement.
Directors underscored, in particular, the importance of controlling the issuance of government
guarantees, introducing a single treasury account, and monitoring closely the financial
performance of public enterprises.
Directors urged the authorities to articulate a medium-term expenditure plan. A detailed and
comprehensive plan, underpinning far-reaching reforms of government spending, is a
prerequisite for the successful implementation of the government’s objectives of reducing
Croatia’s high tax burden, meeting the Maastricht deficit ceiling, and reallocating spending
priorities in order to meet the EU-related needs. Directors recommended that these reforms
should cover wages and the public administration, the welfare system, and subsidies.
Although monetary policy, in the context of the current exchange rate regime, was not an
effective tool for managing aggregate demand, Directors felt it had an important supporting role
to play by reining in the growth in bank liquidity and providing an enabling environment for fiscal
consolidation. Directors welcomed the abolition of direct bank credit ceilings, which had done
little to curb aggregate demand during 2003, as well as the CNB’s plans to introduce, in
cooperation with the Ministry of Finance, open market operations with government paper.
Directors noted the reassuring financial sector indicators, but recommended that the authorities
remain vigilant to ensure that the system can withstand the risks associated with currency
mismatches of borrowers and existing gaps in supervision. Directors encouraged the authorities
to close gaps in nonbank financial supervision and improve cooperation between bank and
nonbank, and domestic and foreign supervisors.

Directors encouraged the authorities to reinvigorate structural reform efforts. In particular, they
urged them to accelerate privatization and give high priority to the restructuring of public
enterprises, most urgently the railway company. They also stressed the need to improve the
business environment with a view to preparing for competition within the EU.
Directors urged the authorities to improve the quality of economic statistics. Deficiencies in
national account and balance of payments statistics, in particular, hampered surveillance and
program monitoring.

IMF Executive Board Approves 20-Month Stand-By Arrangement for the
Republic of Croatia
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has approved a 20-month
Stand-By Arrangement in an amount equivalent to SDR 97 million (about US$141.3 million) for
the Republic of Croatia to support the country’s economic program. The Croatian authorities
intend to treat the arrangement as precautionary and are not planning to draw funds under the
credit.
The previous Stand-By Arrangement, which was also treated as precautionary, was approved on
February 3, 2003 (see Press Release No. 03/13). It expired on April 2, 2004.
Following the Executive Board discussion of the Republic of Croatia on August 4, 2004,
Mr. Takatoshi Kato, Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair, said:
“Croatia’s economic growth and inflation performance since the mid-1990s compares well with
the Central and Eastern European countries (CEECs), the economy is open, and structural reform
is advanced. But this good performance has been accompanied by a worsening of Croatia’s
external current account deficit and rising external debt. These trends accelerated since the turn
of the decade and have made Croatia vulnerable to external shocks. The authorities have
recognized the extent of the external imbalance and should be commended for designing a set of
policies to address it that emphasizes fiscal consolidation and supporting structural measures.
“The total fiscal and quasi-fiscal adjustment of 2¾ percentage points of GDP targeted for
2004-05 is ambitious. The government has shown its commitment by the decision to postpone
the planned VAT rate reduction. But given the uncertainties surrounding the short-term outlook,
the authorities should stand ready to adjust fiscal targets as needed to secure the macroeconomic
objectives of the program.
“The measures to enhance transparency, control quasi-fiscal activities, and improve expenditure
and debt management are welcome. To sustain the fiscal adjustment, the government will need to
undertake significant expenditure reforms in the context of a medium-term expenditure plan.
This would also enable it to achieve its goals of reducing the tax burden and adjusting spending
priorities in order to meet EU accession-related needs. To achieve these goals, the government
should focus on reducing the share of current spending, which is relatively high in Croatia.

-2-

“Exchange rate stability has worked well as the basis for monetary policy in Croatia.
Although this choice constrains monetary policy, managing bank liquidity is still important in a
bank-dominated financial sector. The Croatian National Bank (CNB) should continue to allow
short-term exchange rate fluctuations and stand ready to take measures to safeguard its
international reserves target. The plans to introduce open market operations and the commitment
to close cooperation between the CNB and the Ministry of Finance are welcome.
“The financial sector seems to be in good health and supervision has been improved, but gaps
remain. The CNB needs to increase the focus on the foreign exchange exposure of banks’
customers. The authorities should also close gaps in nonbank financial supervision and improve
cooperation between supervisors at home and abroad, considering the significant risk transfers
from banks to other financial institutions and the high degree of financial integration with the
rest of the world,” Mr. Kato said

ANNEX
Recent Economic Developments
Since the mid-1990s, Croatia has recorded satisfactory GDP growth averaging 4.5 percent and
inflation in the low single digits. These numbers compare well with the EU-15 and Central and
Eastern European countries (CEECs).
However, a persistent gap between savings and investment since the mid-1990s has led to high
current account deficits and a gradual build-up of foreign debt–trends that were fueled by a credit
boom in 2001-02. Macroeconomic policies did not manage to contain the credit-financed surge
in domestic demand and the external position deteriorated sharply during this period. The fiscal
consolidation underway was not sufficient to offset the growth in private consumption and
investment; and monetary policy was constrained by the Croatian National Bank’s preference for
nominal exchange rate stability and a very open capital account. As a result, the current account
deficit rose sharply to 8.4 percent.
Private sector activity started moderating in the second half of 2003, but there was a sharp
reversal of fiscal policy in the run-up to the November elections. As a result, the deficit jumped
to 6.3 percent of GDP, derailing the last Stand-By Arrangement. Although the current account
improved in 2003 due to large tourism receipts, external debt continued to rise reflecting strong
capital inflows.
Program Summary
The government’s program is designed, in the short term, to restore order in Croatia’s public
finances and limit the vulnerability arising from the high current account and external debt
burden, and in the medium term, to modernize and reduce the role of the state, promote private
sector activity, and prepare Croatia to compete within the EU.
Fiscal policy is the main instrument to achieve the objective of narrowing the gap between
domestic savings and investment so as to reverse the trend of the external debt-to-GDP ratio over
the medium term. On the assumption that non debt-creating capital flows would gradually
decline over the medium term as privatization is completed, staff projects that a current account
deficit of 5-5.5 percent of GDP in 2004-05 will gradually decline to about 4 percent in the
medium term. This would first stabilize and then start reducing the external debt burden.
The authorities also expect foreign direct investment unrelated to privatization, to get a boost
from the prospects of EU accession.
In the short term, the government will aim at resuming fiscal consolidation and restoring
transparency. The 2004 budget, including a supplementary budget approved by parliament in
mid-July, targets a general government deficit of 4.5 percent to be achieved through an increase
in revenues and, to a lesser extent, a reduction in investment. In 2005, the emphasis will shift to

-4-

expenditure measures to reduce the deficit to 3.7 percent of GDP. Current spending will decrease
by 1 percentage point of GDP, reflecting a lower wage bill as a result of ongoing reductions in
personnel (mainly defense sector) and cost savings it the administration of public services.
Budget financing will gradually shift to domestic sources, which will help reduce the
government’s exposure to exchange rate risk, boost the development of the domestic capital
market, and help absorb excess liquidity in the private sector in the short run. In addition, the
authorities intend to limit the issuance of new government debt guarantees, strengthen financial
discipline, and improve the performance of public enterprise.
The government also sees the need for fiscal consolidation in a broader context.
Restoring discipline and transparency in the public finances after 2003 is important not only
from a macroeconomic point of view, but also for the accountability and credibility, domestically
and abroad, of the state. For this reason, the consolidation effort would not only focus on
reducing the government deficit, but also encompass quasi-fiscal operations, debt management,
and the wider public sector. The government also sees consolidation in 2004-05 as the
foundation for future measures to reduce the high tax burden in Croatia.
In regard to monetary policy, the CNB intends to pursue its price stability mandate by keeping
the exchange rate of the kuna broadly stable agains the euro. It will pursue its 2004 targets for
reserve and broad money growth at about 8-9 percent. To achieve these targets and signal its
commitment to the external objectives of the program, the CNB introduced on July 1 a new
marginal reserve requirement on foreign borrowing, and intends to maintain its Net Domestic
Assets (NDA) below the level of negative HRK 3 billion for the remainder of the year.
Further, the CNB plans to start open market operations (OMOs) with government paper to
enhance liquidity management and facilitate the shift in government financing toward domestic
sources.
On public sector reforms, the government is planning to take steps to enhance fiscal transparency
and improve expenditure and debt management based on recent IMF and World Bank findings
on major weaknesses in these areas. Further, the government plans to set annual budgets in the
context of a medium-term fiscal policy framework, and ensure the long-term sustainability of
the pension system. The authorities intend to restore momentum in the privatization process.
The Privatization Fund (HFP) will aim at privatizing all companies in which the government
holds a share of up to 25 percent by year-end and all remaining holdings in its portfolio by endJune 2005. Outside HFP’s portfolio, the government will resume efforts to restructure and
privatize large state enterprises. Finally, the government will take steps to improve the business
environment, financial sector supervision, and statistics.

Statement by Jeroen Kremers, Executive Director for Republic of Croatia
and Tihomir Stučka, Advisor to Executive Director
August 4, 2004
Introduction
Mid-2004, Croatia obtained candidacy status for EU membership, and accession
negotiations will commence early 2005. Market analysts have already acknowledged this
political and economic accomplishment; in July, S&P improved Croatia’s outlook to positive
from stable. The accession process will anchor future reforms and economic policies. These
will be undertaken according to defined government plans, and it is foreseen that these plans
are tackled within the framework of the requested precautionary Fund program and the
World Bank Country Assistance Strategy to benefit from their effect in catalyzing good
policies domestically, as well as to enhance external credibility and knowledge transfer. The
authorities are aware of the remaining structural and economic weaknesses that need to be
addressed fully. In particular, the fiscal slippages toward end-2003, when lack of monitoring
and some excessive spending ended up in a higher-than-envisaged fiscal deficit. This has led
partly to the increase in external debt and is addressed under the requested Fund program.
Hence, enhancing fiscal consolidation and transparency is at the core of the authorities’
economic program to stabilize and subsequently reduce external debt, as demonstrated by
the supplementary budget and the three-year rolling general government budget passed
recently in parliament.
EU accession
The country enjoys EU ‘market economy status’ and numerous issues related to the
aquis communitaire have been resolved under the Stability and Association Agreement.
Therefore, entering the EU in 2007 appears feasible, albeit challenging. Overall, the
accession process will be conducive to advances in structural reforms in the legal, regulatory
and judicial areas, to achieve harmonization with the EU and remove administrative
obstacles. In the fiscal area, pre-accession funds are treated with caution. It is well
understood that, while available pre-accession grants will ease the financing of expenditures,
matching these funds is likely to lead to increased spending pressures to be compensated
elsewhere.
Fiscal stance
The Fund program target is to stabilize and subsequently reduce overall
external debt driven by the fiscal sector and private foreign-owned banks. Therefore, the
primary goal is fiscal consolidation and public sector restructuring. In 2004, according to the
supplementary budget, the fiscal adjustment will amount to 1.8 percentage points of
GDP, with a deficit of 4.5 percent of GDP. By 2007, the deficit is to be reduced to 2.9
percent of GDP, notwithstanding the expenditure pressures related to EU accession.
Staff notices correctly that in the first year some short- and long-term revenue
measures aid the fiscal adjustment, instead of additional restraint in current expenditures.
There are several external aspects affecting adversely current expenditures, therefore
rendering a different expenditure composition in 2004 difficult. First, to increase fiscal
transparency, the Railway Company (HŽ) has been integrated into the budget, terminating

-2the previous practice of financing parts of its current operations off-budget. Second, the
authorities will need to provide the appropriate environment for the return of refugees, as
agreed with the EU. Third, in the last quarter of 2003, the previous government raised the
wage bill by 8 percent starting in 2004 without completing the downsizing of the
administration. Fourth, hospital arrears accruing to previous years have had a significant
impact on current expenditures. Finally, current spending is not as high as it may appear
from the staff paper. The overall impression from the peer comparison in Table 8 (p. 35) is
somewhat biased in that it incorporates countries which include the informal economy in
their GDP. This is not the case for Croatia.
The authorities desire a Fund program with high ownership and high
credibility, reflecting their own policies in Fund program conditionality. Hence, the 2004
budget is needed to stabilizing the fiscal stance, increasing transparency, and refocusing on
domestic financing. In the next two years, this will be followed by deeper changes in the
expenditures composition. In this regard, during the first six months of being in power, the
government has undertaken several concrete measures. In the health sector, 30 new long-term
savings measures have been introduced mid-2004. The decision has been taken to moderate
capital spending. More precisely, the new four-year motorway investment plan is set to be
published end-2004 slowing down capital spending in the following years. Finally,
improvements in monetary and fiscal policy coordination have taken root; the government
has changed plans to issue samurai bonds, and instead issued bonds on the domestic market,
albeit at higher interest costs. Institutional investors hold substantial amounts of the issued
domestic debt, therefore having an impact on foreign indebtedness.
Structural measures
To gather public support for reforms, the government has adopted and is in the
process of publishing plans for the period 2004 – 2007. These have four main pillars. The
first pillar refers to the aforementioned fiscal consolidation and enhanced transparency
including the Railway Company and other extra-budgetary institutions, most notably the
Motorway Company and the Road Company, into the automated single treasury account by
2005. This will improve budget execution monitoring. The second pillar refers to subsidy
reductions and increased efficiency of the administration. The authorities intend to decrease
subsidies by 1.2 and the wage bill by 1.5 percentage points of GDP by 2007. The third pillar
defines the reallocation of budgetary means to growth-enhancing sectors. This implies
reallocating spending from the defense sector and capital expenditures for infrastructure to
education and science. Furthermore, social and health spending will need to be significantly
reduced and targeted more efficiently. Here, the second round of pension reforms and the
health care reform will play a crucial role. Finally, the fourth pillar reflects privatization and
tax reform plans. The plan is to restructure the public sector and reduce the overall tax
burden, which is recognized as one of the elements impeding stronger greenfield
investments.
Monetary policy
Financial intermediation has grown strongly in Croatia, and as a result, foreignowned banks have a lion’s share in mounting external debt. More precisely, US$ 720
million or 38 percent of the gross external debt increase in 2004 is associated with banks and

-3their leasing companies. Despite this, credit growth in 2004 abated compared to 2003,
portfolio quality has not deteriorated, and profitability remains high. In addition, since
around 90 percent of the banking sector is foreign owned, it is widely accepted that risk
management is advanced. In terms of banks’ external indebtedness, loans from parent
companies have long maturities. At the same time, non-resident deposits are unlikely to be
prone to reversals, since parent banks are major regional players and, hence, walking away
could involve exposure to reputational risk.
Nevertheless, the authorities are not proponents of the Lawson doctrine1 - in July, the
CNB introduced a 24 percent unremunerated reserve requirement for new foreign
borrowing. Hence, from August onward, banks will have to deposit as reserves 24 percent of
borrowing from abroad. This should assist the efforts of fiscal policy to stabilize overall
external debt. The CNB has refrained more from intervening in the foreign exchange market
compared to previous years, mostly to moderate appreciation pressures. Foreign exchange
