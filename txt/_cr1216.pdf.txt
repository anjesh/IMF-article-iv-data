STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2011 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION
Approved By

Ajai Chopra and Aasim Husain

This supplement updates financial market developments that occurred since the
main report was issued. These developments, together with other recent economic
data that are in line with the outlook in the staff report, do not affect the thrust of the
staff appraisal.
The Central Bank of Turkey’s new dual-policy rate framework (see paragraphs 31
and 32 of the staff report) achieved a marked increase in average interest rates
and a slowdown in financial intermediation, but depreciation has resumed. Since
the policy was introduced in late October, overnight interbank rates jumped to around
9¾ percent on average, with considerable day-to-day variability. This was accompanied
by only a modest reduction in lira liquidity as banks’ demand for precautionary
balances increased in response to the greater uncertainty inherent in the new system.
Yields on the benchmark government bond jumped by 2 percentage points in tandem
with the higher average interbank rate, and stood at 10½ percent on November 22,
while trading volumes have slumped. In addition, and in conjunction with the weaker
domestic and external environment, credit growth has further slowed. Although the lira
initially appreciated in response to the effective tightening, depreciation pressure has
recently resumed on intensifying global concerns. Despite restarting daily fx sale
auctions (a cumulative US$550 million since November 1, 2011), the lira has
depreciated somewhat faster than other emerging-market currencies during the past
two weeks. Nonetheless, CBT reserves have risen by US$5 billion during this period as
banks increased the amount of RR on lira liabilities they hold in the form of fx.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2011 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
November 14, 2011

KEY ISSUES
Context: The dynamic rebound from the 2008–09 global crisis has put output well above
pre-crisis levels. However, loose macroeconomic policies and a sizable competitiveness
gap caused a surge in credit-financed, import-intensive domestic demand. The current
account deficit has risen precipitously, funded largely by short-term debt and other
volatile flows. Turkey’s hard-earned resilience, built up following its 2000–01 financial
crisis, has been weakened by the recent unbalanced growth episode.
Challenges: With very low savings, Turkish economic growth relies on capital inflows to
finance imports. When inflows are abundant, growth is strong; when flows reverse, the
economy contracts, leaving Turkey prone to boom-bust cycles. Since mid 2009, capital
inflows have intensified on favorable push and pull factors, including abundant
yield-seeking global liquidity, healthy Turkish balance sheets, and Turkish policymakers’
agile response to the global crisis. With risks rising, what can be done to deliver a soft
landing? What policies can reduce the propensity for future boom-bust cycles?
Policies: The authorities’ response relied on improving the headline fiscal balance and
introducing credit-restraining prudential measures. But the centerpiece has been an
unconventional monetary policy framework intended to deter very short-term inflows,
moderate credit growth, and more recently, manage output, exchange rate, and inflation
volatility. With a potentially conflicting set of objectives and no clear evidence of
effectiveness, staff considered monetary policy overburdened while fiscal, prudential, and
structural policies were underutilized. Staff advocated a much tighter structural fiscal
position and financial policies geared to moderating systemic risk to allow monetary
policy to maintain both inflation and interest rates at levels similar to other emerging
markets within a conventional inflation-targeting framework, limiting competitiveness
loss and reducing attractiveness to short-term carry-trade inflows. In the near term,
raising the single policy rate within a transparent monetary policy framework would limit
the risk of capital reversal, and hence help achieve a soft landing.

Historically-low real interest rates

and a considerable competitiveness gap
contributed to a sharp widening of the
non-energy current account deficit (CAD).
The net import intensity of GDP rose to an alltime high as nominal import growth
accelerated to around 40 percent—about
twice the rate of exports. As a result, the
current account deficit expanded from over
6½ percent of GDP in 2010 to 9¼ percent of
GDP in H1 2011. Although energy accounts for
the largest part of the trade deficit (around
4¾ percent of GDP on average in recent
years), the non-energy balance contributed
three-quarters of the deterioration. These
developments reflect a large decline in the
private sector saving-investment balance that
more than offset the improved public sector
balance, in addition to continued substitution
toward imports reflecting the—until recently—
considerably overvalued real exchange rate

The most discernable effect was a

decoupling of the lira from other emerging
market currencies. The lira weakened
immediately relative to peer countries, as
inflows—while remaining strong—were
insufficient to cover the burgeoning current
account deficit. This is consistent with
anecdotal evidence that investors were wary of
the new framework. On the other hand, loan
growth slowed decisively only with a
considerable lag as banks continued to actively
tap short-term foreign funding.

banks’ profits having moderated due to
competition for loan-market share (Box 3),

real rates on lira-denominated deposits remain
low, and a meaningful yield curve for deposits

Relative to the current lira exchange rate, the MTP
implicitly assumes a sizable nominal appreciation on
average in 2012. This translates their larger (than
projected by the mission) CAD forecast, measured in
dollars, into a similar ratio relative to GDP. An
implication of the MTP’s 2012 forecast of a modest
CAD adjustment measured in dollars and the more
appreciated exchange rate is that external financing is
not considered to be constraining.

The authorities and staff agreed that

structural reforms are needed to deliver a
permanent improvement in the current
account deficit. To moderate import demand,
the authorities raised indirect taxes on several
categories of imported consumer durables
(large engine-capacity cars, cell phones), and
are considering measures to decrease
dependence on the imports of intermediate
goods, although this was seen as longer-term
endeavor. The mission noted that attracting
investment to facilitate domestic sourcing of
manufactured inputs requires improving the
business climate, including combating
informality to support a revenue-neutral cut in
the tax burden on formal-sector employment
and activity. The decision to decouple all tax
audit functions from tax collection was viewed
as a set-back for encouraging voluntary
compliance. Timely adjustment of regulated
energy prices to changes in world prices and
the exchange rate would encourage efficient
usage and domestic production to cut down
on imports, while avoiding loss buildup in
public energy companies. The mission
therefore welcomed the recent tariff increases
as a step toward achieving cost-recovery
pricing. They noted that passage of the
updated Commercial Code and Code of
Obligations—once fully effective in mid-

Greater flexibility of the formal

labor market would raise employment,
lower inflation persistence, and distribute
the gains from growth more evenly.
Preparation of a National Employment
Strategy remains ongoing, with a focus on
microeconomic labor market measures. The
authorities attributed the strong employment
gains since the crisis to the rapid pace of
growth and the 5 percentage point cut in the
employers’ social security contribution
introduced in 2008. To encourage new
employment and job mobility within the
formal sector, the mission urged lowering
restrictions on temporary and part-time work,
and replacing the current ex post severance
pay with a pre-funded, lower-cost insurance
scheme. Keeping the growth rate of the
minimum wage and civil servant salaries
strictly in line with the inflation point target—
and with no ex post adjustment for inflation
overshoots—would improve external

TURKEY

Box 1. Turkey’s External Competitiveness
Relative to late 2010, Turkey’s external
competitiveness has improved considerably on the
back of a large nominal depreciation, but
sustainability could be jeopardized by persistent
differentials in the growth rates of prices and wages
relative to trading partners.
Real effective exchange rates based on consumer
and producer prices fell by close to 20 percent from
their October 2010 historical peaks, reflecting recent
depreciation of the nominal effective exchange rate.
As a result, price-based REER indicators are now
below levels prevailing during the crisis, but remain
some 5 percent above levels of 2003. Coming from a
much higher peak in late 2010, the ULC-based REER
fell sharply in Q1 2011, as unit labor cost growth
slowed on moderating nominal wage increases and
improved labor productivity. But this was partially
reversed in Q2 2011 on account of weakening labor
productivity, keeping the ULC-based REER elevated.
The US dollar-euro exchange rate is also an
important determinant of the competitiveness of
Turkey’s exports, especially in view of the high
import content—and hence relatively low domestic
valued added—of Turkish production. Many raw
materials and intermediate inputs are priced in US
dollars or currencies that move closely with the US
dollar, while about half of exports are sold in Europe,
priced in euros. Thus a strengthening of the euro
relative to the US dollar increases export profit
margins, on average. This is supported by the
observation that growth of imports (around
70 percent of which are intermediate goods) tends
to outpace that of exports when the US dollar
weakens against the euro. Since mid-2010, the more
appreciated euro relative to the US dollar has
therefore supported exporters.
Fairly rapid export growth in recent years has kept
Turkey’s share of major advanced country import
markets (Germany and the EU as a whole) fairly
stable. However, penetration of emerging-market
has declined considerably since the global financial
crisis, reversing in part the significant gains of earlier
years. The disruption in MENA external trade due to
unrest in some countries is expected to have only a
modest adverse on Turkey’s exports, and may even
present an opportunity in view of disruptions to
production in affected countries.

CGER-type assessments of the equilibrium value of
the real exchange rate in Fall 2011 continue to point
to a considerable competitiveness gap. Although the
extent of misalignment has narrowed significantly
since the previous vintage in view of the substantial
real depreciation since end-2010, still-large current
account deficits and a deteriorating net foreign asset
position projected for the medium term suggest a
persistent competitiveness gap. The recent nominal
depreciation since the CGER reference period of
July-August would tend to further reduce the
misalignment, but the magnitude in nominal
effective terms is likely moderate (given that many
currencies simultaneously depreciated) and may not
be persistent. Moreover, the near-term improvement
is projected to unwind gradually due to persistent
inflation differentials.
In the context of large capital inflows, however,
standard CGER assessments may overstate the extent
of overvaluation. The recent surge of capital inflows
to Turkey has not only financed the current account
deficit in an accounting sense but may have also
caused it in a behavioral sense: by relaxing
consumers’ budget constraints to facilitate import
demand. When the inflows abate, as they have now
begun to do, both the near- and medium-term
current account projections would improve which, in
turn, would imply smaller misalignment. This is
consistent with the notion of “capital account
dominance” in Emerging Markets. Alternatively, if the
flows—though mostly of a short-term duration—turn
out to be more persistent, then the equilibrium
exchange rate itself would appreciate, reflecting
better fundamentals, and hence leading to a smaller
estimated misalignment, other things being equal.1
__________________________________________________
1

It is difficult to predict if a surge in inflows is temporary or
portends a persistent trend. A rule of thumb, offered by Ostry
et al. (2010), is that flows that push the REER toward equilibrium
are more likely to be persistent than flows that lead to
overshooting since these would presumably be subject to
future reversal as overshooting eventually unwinds. This
suggests current inflows into Turkey are most likely temporary.

Box 2. Implications of Misclassifying Securities Repos
In recent years, many emerging markets have
seen capital inflows tilt heavily toward
portfolio debt securities. This reflects deep and
liquid government debt markets, and sizable
interest differentials. Portfolio debt flows also
reversed rapidly in recent months on renewed
concerns about euro-area sustainability,
accompanied by strong depreciation pressures.
Relative to GDP, Turkey received considerable
such flows during 2010 and Q1 2011, and saw
some of the largest reversals in September 2011.
However, some of Turkey’s portfolio debt
flows are not in fact outright sales to
nonresidents, but the first leg of sale-andrepurchase agreements (securities repos).
These agreements involve the sale of a security by
a domestic bank to a foreigner, with a
commitment to repurchase the security at an
agreed future date and price. Functionally, a repo
is equivalent to collateralized borrowing by the
spot seller of the security. While the security may

be denominated in local currency, in most
emerging-market cases, the cash exchanged is
typically in fx. Importantly, the duration of the
repo is not linked to the maturity of the security,
and repos are typically short term. As of
June 2011, Turkish banks had US$15.6 billion of
external repos, of which US$11.2 billion had
maturities of less than one year.
Statistical Treatment of Repos1
Securities repos involve dual concepts of
ownership. Legal ownership (“full, unfettered
title”) of the security moves from the domestic
bank to the foreigner at the start of the contract,
and back again at termination. However,
beneficial ownership remains throughout with the
domestic-bank seller because—given the
commitment to repurchase at a fixed price—the
seller bears all valuation risk.

Box 2. Implications of Misclassifying Securities Repos (concluded)
Implications
The statistical treatment of securities repos
follows the economic character of the
instrument, rather than its legal format. The
BRSA follows this convention, consistent with
International Accounting Standards and the
revised System of National Accounts.2
Accordingly, since the domestic bank retains
the risks and benefits of ownership, the security
remains on the domestic bank’s balance sheet
throughout the repo contract. The loan—and
the corresponding receipt of cash—is recorded
separately, expanding its balance sheet. The
corresponding entries in the financial account
of the BoP are an “other investment” inflow
when the repo is initiated, and an outflow
through the same category when the contract is
unwound.
Recording repo transactions using the legalownership concept—as done by the CBT—
gives a quite different impression. If the repo
is treated as a separate spot sale and future
purchase, the size of the domestic bank’s
balance sheet would remain fixed, but with a
decline in securities and an increase in cash on
the asset side. These entries would be reversed
when the contract expires. Under this
treatment, the financial account of the BoP
would report a nonresident inflow into portfolio
securities, with a similar outflow when the
contract matures.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Recording securities repos using the legalownership convention makes it more
difficult to gauge the extent and location of
market risk. This has several implications: First,
while Turkey’s official BoP and external debt
statistics suggest foreigners bear the risk of
interest rate fluctuations, that risk in fact resides
with the domestic bank. Second, the maturity of
the underlying security conveys no information
about the duration of the loan. Third, domestic
banks’ short-term external debt is understated.
Fourth, the conventional wisdom that sudden
reversals of portfolio flows create only modest
exchange rate pressure—because falling localcurrency asset values erode the amount of fx
reserves needed to repatriate the investment—
does not apply. Instead, if the foreign lender is
unwilling to renew the securities repo, the
domestic bank will need to secure sufficient fx
to repay the loan in full, exerting downward
pressure on the currency. And fifth, margin calls
on the domestic bank to top-up collateral in
response to a rise in domestic interest rates
(and hence a lower value of the security)
effectively shrink the net size of the loan.

Box 3. Banks’ Competition for Market Share and Implications for Policy Transmission
Turkish banks’ drive for market share is widely seen
as taking precedence over near-term profit
maximization. Relative to other EMs, the market share
of the five largest banks—accounting for around
70 percent of system assets—has remained remarkably
stable, and the rank-ordering of their individual market
shares has barely changed in recent years. This
suggests preserving market share has been an
important objective for large Turkish banks, including
during the recent period of rapid credit growth.
There are several reasons why Turkish banks may
place market share ahead of near-term profit
maximization. First, a large market share supports fee
income—a growing contributor to bank profits. Second,
larger banks may be perceived as less exposed to
deposit runs, thereby lowering the risk premium they
pay to attract depositors. Third, larger banks may be
less vulnerable to takeovers from rivals. Fourth, larger
banks may benefit from economies of scale. Fifth, with
the growing importance of foreign funding, size may
improve access to, and lower the cost of, credit in the
international wholesale market. And finally, in recent
years, the BRSA has limited dividend payouts, thus
encouraging growing market share (and hence future
profits) over current profits.

increase in URR, being the first to pass on these higher
intermediation costs to lending rates would have risked
losing market share. Instead, banks tended to absorb
the cost into lower profits and accelerate lending to
compensate lower profit margin with higher volume.
Hence, the higher URR were not initially successful at
moderating loan growth. This was compounded by the
rapid loan expansion of state banks, pressuring other
banks to follow. These considerations—drive for market
share and the privileged funding position of state
banks—would likely have led to a similarly weak or
delayed credit response by banks if instead of raising
URR, the CBT had raised the policy rate. On the other
hand, raising risk weights and provisioning in June 2011
directly impacted, among others, the large state banks
that had previously lent most aggressively, encouraging
immediate system-wide repricing of loans.

With state banks having certain inherent
advantages over their peers, aiming to preserve
market share may have negatively impacted profits
of other banks. Relative to other banks, state banks
(including the largest bank in the system) have access
to cheaper and more stable deposit funding because
they are perceived as less risky in view of an implicit
government guarantee. Moreover, they generally offer
lower lending rates because their retail borrowers
(including civil servants) are seen as good credit risks.
These benefits give state banks an edge over their
competitors in terms of funding costs and lending
rates. Moreover, state banks have lower loan-to-deposit
ratios (LTDs) than other banks, and hence do not need
to rely on less stable, more expensive wholesale
funding to finance loan expansion compared with other
banks with much higher LTDs. This allowed state banks
to be market leaders during the recent credit boom,
growing their loan books earlier and faster than other
banks, and encouraging other banks to catch up.
The strong drive for market share may have
generated a “collective action” problem that
weakens or delays the effectiveness of policies
intended to slow credit growth. Following the

Box 4. The CBT’s Recent Policy Actions
Since early August 2011, the CBT has made
numerous changes to its policy instruments.
Two separate periods can be identified: (i) Augustmid October, in response to concerns about
sovereign debt problems in Europe and
uncertainties regarding the global economy; and
(ii) since mid October, responding mainly to a
sharp increase in inflation.

(e) URR were imposed on banks’ gold deposit
accounts.



To support real activity, the main policy
interest rate—the 7-day repo rate—was
further lowered by 50 bp in August to
5.75 percent.



To reduce the cost of financial intermediation
transacted in lira, and to promote longer nondeposit bank funding, RRs on TL liabilities
were reduced in early October by effective
0.6 percentage points, with the largest
reductions on longer-duration non-deposit
liabilities, releasing TL3.2 billion to banks.

August –mid October



To support the lira and shore up fx reserves:
(a) The CBT raised its O/N borrowing rate from
1.5 percent to 5 percent, considerably
narrowing the interest rate corridor to limit
potential volatility of money market rates that
had previously discouraged very short-term
inflows;
(b) URR on banks’ fx liabilities were reduced
three times (in July, August, and October) and
mostly on longer duration liabilities by an
effective 1.5 percentage points, releasing
about US$2.8 billion to banks;
(c) Part of RR obligations on TL liabilities (up to
10 percent from September and 20 percent
from October) was allowed to be held in fx.
This was intended to encourage banks to
repatriate their fx liquid assets back to Turkey,
and could potentially boost the CBT’s reserves
by up to US$7.6 billion. Moreover, because
the cost of borrowing fx is lower than lira,
banks’ opportunity cost of holding URR was
reduced—equivalent to a reduction in the RR
ratio on lira liabilities;
(d) the CBT scaled back its daily fx purchases
(from US$50 billion to US$40 billion in May
and to US$30 billion in June), halted fx activity
at end July, and switched to fx sales in early
August. Total sales reached US$4.9 billion
through mid October, with varying daily
amounts;



To contain the deterioration in inflation
expectations, especially resulting from TL
depreciation:
(a) The CBT engaged in large-scale fx selling
auctions and direct intervention. Total sales
through auctions reached US$3.3 billion.
(b) The O/N lending rate was raised from 9
percent to 12.5 percent (and from 8 percent to
12 percent for primary dealers). This facilitates
greater upside volatility of money market
rates;
(c) On RR obligations relating to TL liabilities, a
maximum of 40 percent (raised from the
previous 20 percent) may be held in fx, and up
to 10 percent may be held in gold. If fully
utilized, this would add a combined US$7.7
billion to CBT reserves. In addition, URR on
lira-denominated short-term liabilities were
lowered, resulting in a 2 percentage point
effective reduction.
(d) The CBT re-opened its “blind broker” fx
borrowing and lending facility to facilitate
greater mobility of fx between banks in
response to heightened uncertainties in
international markets.

Box 5. Inflation Targets in Turkey
Among the group of inflation targeters,
Turkey stands out as having one of the
highest targets. Targets are generally set
higher in EMs than in advanced economies to
minimize the output cost from low inflation as
EMs face more structural problems including
higher price rigidity, lower monetary and fiscal
credibility, and larger exchange rate volatility.
However, Turkey’s 5 percent target for 2012 is
several percentage points higher than for most
other major EMs.1 Indeed, in mid-2008, Turkey
revised up its end-of-period inflation targets
from a constant 4 percent to 7.5, 6.5 and
5.5 percent, respectively, for 2009–11 in
response to the upside risks posed by food and
energy prices to the medium-term inflation
outlook and the possibility of further supply
side shocks.
Turkey also has the widest tolerance band,
intended to accommodate its higher food
inflation volatility than other
________________________________

EMs. The high volatility of Turkey’s
unprocessed food prices together with its high
share in the consumption basket (around
15 percent) is the main reason given for setting
the inflation tolerance band at ±2 percentage

volatility of Turkey’s food prices. In addition to
measurement issues,3 while Turkey exports
unprocessed food, such imports are very
restricted, thereby precluding international
trade as a means to smooth domestic prices.

Box 5. Inflation Targets in Turkey (concluded)
Turkey has maintained high import tariffs and
tight quotas to support farmers, which account
for around a quarter of the workforce. This has
contributed to a considerable increase of food
price volatility since 2007, and the level of food
inflation is among the highest within the EM
group. Other structural factors also compound the
effect of import controls, notably uncertain
agriculture subsidies, geographical concentration
of production, volatile export prices and external
demand, and long supply chains with a
prevalence of small farmers which immediately
price in weather effects.4 Nonetheless, looking at
sample period of 2004-2011, the volatility of
headline inflation and of food inflation weighted
by its share in the basket is not among the
highest within the group of EMs. However,

Turkey’s inflation was on average the highest
among the group during 2004–11.

Despite the combination of a high point
target and a wide tolerance band, Turkey
has frequently overshot the top of the band.
The exceptions were the recession year of 2009,
and in 2010 when inflation came in just below
the revised target due to a large downward
shock to food prices. Thus, the flexibility
afforded by the wide band has tended to be
used asymmetrically.

Box 6. Other Key Takeaways on the Banking Sector
Profitability: Banks’ return on assets and
equity have significantly declined since 2009
and currently stand at 1.6 and 13.6 percent,
respectively, in August 2011. This decline has
been mainly driven by declining net interest
rate margins amid banks’ strong competition
for market share for loans and the waning
effect from the one-off repricing of assets in
response to the CBT’s more than 10 percentage
point cut in the policy rate during late 20082009.
NPLs: Despite very rapid credit growth, NPLs
relative to total loans have declined to historical
lows (under 3 percent). This was aided by: (i)
banks selling off NPLs; (ii) following the crisis,
some restructuring of loans in distress; and (iii)
more recently, the increase in the denominator,
with nominal NPLs remaining stable. Looking
ahead, loan quality is likely to be cyclical,
especially as much of recent lending is
concentrated in profitable, but potentially-risky,
uncollateralized consumer lending. A protracted
economic slowdown could lead to a steady rise
in NPLs, especially on credit card and general
purpose loans, lowering banks’ profitability and
capital buffers.

Capital Adequacy Ratios: Based on Basel I
regulatory standards, banks are adequately
capitalized with an aggregate CAR of
16½ percent in October, comfortably above the
BRSA’s floor of 12 percent. This is down
from 19 percent at end-2010 (and 21 percent at
end 2009), mainly because of the shift from
zero risk-weighted government securities to
positive risk-weighted loans during the recent
credit boom. The introduction of Basel II
in 2012, as well as the recent currency
depreciation that expanded the liraequivalent—and hence risk-weight—of fx loans,
will further reduce CARs. In recent years, the
BRSA has restricted dividend payouts by banks
with low CARs. Going forward, CARs may be a
constraint on future loan growth. The criteria
for assessing minimum required CARs for
foreign-owned banks was recently modified,
requiring several banks to increase capital.

Box 6. Other Key Takeaways on the Banking Sector (Concluded)
External Funding: Nearly one third of Turkey’s
banking system (measured by assets) has links
to parents in peripheral Europe and, despite
limited direct funding from their foreign
parents, availability and cost of funding is likely
to reflect to some extent the parents’ financial
condition. While the Turkish banking sector
have continued to tap syndicated loans at low
spreads, external funding conditions have
undoubtedly been affected by funding strains
in international markets. Possible de-leveraging
by European banks as they rebuild their capital
ratios may further affect Turkish banks’ access
to wholesale funding. Turkish branches abroad
play a smaller role in providing loans to
resident firms than in the past, but have
become more active in securing external
funding (accompanied by an increase in their
holdings of government securities). Overall, at
13 percent of total liabilities, banks’ external
funding is not high relative to other countries in
the region.

40

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Open Foreign Currency Positions: Banks’
on-balance sheet short fx positions, which tend
to be closed off-balance sheet through the use
of cross currency swaps (CCS), recently widened
close to its historical peak, reflecting banks’
growing recourse to external funding. The
recent sharp increase in average CBT and
market interest rates has fed into higher costs
for short-term CCS, which banks use to
repeatedly roll over sizable short-duration
swaps, exposing them to interest rate risk.

APPENDIX I: EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
ANALYSIS
Under the baseline, gross external debt,
while increasing, remains sustainable, but
is vulnerable to a large exchange rate
shock (Appendix Table I.1). External debt is
expected to rise to 48 percent of GDP
by 2016 on account of a still-wide current
account deficit, slower GDP growth than
prior to the crisis, and a large share of debtcreating inflows. Standard tests show the
external debt is robust to a combined ¼
standard deviation shock in interest rate,
growth, and current account. External debt
will remain below 60 percent of GDP under
individual shocks or a combination of the
three shocks. However, an additional real
depreciation of 30 percent in 2011 would
cause gross external debt to increase to
70 percent of GDP in 2012. Nevertheless, a
real exchange rate shock of this size would

58

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

likely further precipitate adjustment in the
current account and other second-round
effects that would partially mitigate the
impact on external debt, but which are not
captured in a static debt sustainability
exercise.
Turkey’s decreasing exposure to the Fund
and moderate external debt levels should
ensure adequate capacity to repay the
Fund (Appendix Table I.2). Under the
baseline scenario, the exposure to Turkey
would decline very rapidly and fall to only
SDR 1.9 billion at end-2011 (129 percent of
new quota, 0.4 percent of GDP, or
3.3 percent of reserves). Annual debt service
to the Fund would remain very small at
around 0.1-0.4 percent of GDP.

1/ The external debt ratio is calculated by dividing external debt numbers in U.S. dollars based on official Treasury figures by GDP in U.S. dollars calculated by staff using the average exchange rate (consolidated from daily data
published by the CBT).
2/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms, g = real GNP growth rate, e =
nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
3/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP
deflator).
4/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
5/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period. Differs slightly from external financing requirement in Staff Report because includes official
transfers and IMF repurchases but excludes increase in portfolio and other investment assets.
6/ The key variables include real GNP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GNP.

7/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels of the last
projection year.

A. Introduction
1.

Implementing the dictum of avoiding

pro-cyclical fiscal policy requires being able to
correctly identify the non-structural
component of revenue.1 Applying the wrong
concept can lead to systematic bias that, in turn,
causes an unintentionally pro-cyclical fiscal stance
or creates the perception of fiscal space, which
disappears when the economic cycle turns. Prior
to the 2008 global financial crisis, many advanced
and emerging market countries ran fiscal
surpluses on headline and output-gap adjusted
terms, but which gave a false sense of policy
prudence. Only once the boom ended did it
become apparent that cyclical revenue had been
grossly underestimated. In numerous countries,
fiscal revenue still has not recovered, forcing

policymakers to make difficult adjustment
decisions.
2.

Failing to recognize that factors other

than the output gap can drive transient
revenue was largely responsible for
overstating structural positions prior to the
crisis. While relevance varied by country, these
other factors included commodity booms with
improved terms of trade, price bubbles affecting
real estate and financial assets, domestic demand
and import booms related to overvalued real
exchange rates and plentiful capital inflows, and
sticky employment reflecting labor market
contracts and flexicurity arrangements.

contributed to the rapid increase in Turkey’s
tax revenue. Especially since early 2009, total tax
revenue has risen much faster than nominal GDP.
GDP also does a poor job explaining collections of
VAT on imports and VAT on domestic goods and
services.2 Moreover, import VAT has not moved
together with nominal consumption, and it is
apparent that consumption does not explain well

Taxes on imports (which include

import VAT, various excises, and customs
duties) comprised 16 percent of tax revenue
in 2010, and have been one of the more
dynamic sources of tax revenue growth in
recent years. This is consistent with the greater
cyclical variability of domestic demand and
imports than of GDP during boom-and-bust
cycles, and with the relatively high rates of indirect
taxes compared with direct taxes. The
pronounced cyclical buoyancy of imports reflects
in turn Turkey’s persistent external
competitiveness gap, together with volatile
external financing flows. In addition, in 2009–10,
corporate income tax paid by the banking sector
was unusually large, reflecting the boost to profits
from the steep decline in the policy interest rate
that widened banks’ interest margins. A number

for the G&NFS balance—the relevant concept for

the over-the-cycle excess of domestic demand

reflects that the G&NFS deficit does not imply a
unique level of imports and, while imports are an
important component of the tax base, exports are
largely untaxed. Hence, imports—rather than

Ideally, to calculate the G&NFS norm and the import
norm, one would use the norm values of exports,
current transfers, and factor income. Using actual
exports pre-crisis (post crisis) likely understates
(overstates) somewhat the export norm because the
rest of the world was (is) importing above (below) its
import norm. On the other hand, interest payments
abroad are now likely higher than in equilibrium
because of the large capital inflows. In any event, the

D. Structural Revenue and the Underlying Fiscal Position
21.

Because every approach to cyclical

adjustment involves an element of judgment,
how can one assess whether the approach
chosen is reasonable and an improvement
over the standard output-gap approach? One
possibility is to look at the behavior of structural
revenue. If structural revenue is correctly
estimated, differences across time should be
explained by changes in tax policy and/or
compliance. Large unexplained differences would
therefore raise doubts about the underlying
methodology.
22.

In Turkey, adjusting import-related

revenue using only the output gap leaves
behind large swings over time (2 percentage
points of potential GDP) in derived structural
import revenue. Such large differences cannot
be explained by discretionary policy measures. On
the other hand, the transient revenue approach
applied to imports generates a broadly stable
estimate of structural import-related revenue. A
similar result holds for total revenue. The
structural revenue series obtained by deducting
transient import revenue is much smoother than
the one constructed by subtracting standard
output-gap cyclical revenue.
23.

To more systematically assess how well

the transient revenue approach performs, the
impact of discretionary tax policy changes
should be removed from structural revenue.
The preferred approach to cyclical adjustment is
the one that generates the flatter structural

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

revenue series. Data limitations preclude adjusting
for policy changes prior to 2008. Discretionary
changes since then include a tax amnesty,
temporary stimulus tax cuts, and increases in
various excise rates. These measures raised
revenue by ¼ to ¾ percentage points of GDP
during 2008–10. Excluding these effects, it is
apparent the transient revenue approach yields a
flatter series for structural revenue, and hence is
better at removing cyclical and temporary
revenue effects than the standard output-gap
approach.

TURKEY 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—ANALYTICAL ANNEX

24.

From an exceptionally strong position

during and immediately after Turkey’s 2000
financial crisis, the structural fiscal position has
steadily weakened. This is apparent independent
of which approach is used to calculate structural
revenue. However, the transient revenue
approach indicates a faster deterioration than the
standard approach. In addition, while the headline
balance suggests the crisis-related stimulus was
withdrawn in 2010, and with a further
improvement in 2011, the transient revenue
approach reveals further stimulus was added each
year (while the standard approach indicates a
neutral stance in 2010 and 2011).5

Note that both approaches attribute the headline
improvement in 2010–11 solely to cyclical factors.

The extent of ERPT depends on the

degree of market competition. Exporters of
homogeneous goods or goods with close
substitutes tend to face fixed dollar prices,
implying zero ERPT, consistent with the smallcountry assumption of a price taker in
international markets. On the other hand,
exporters of differentiated goods have more
pricing power and are more likely to fix their
prices in local currency (full ERPT). Regarding
imports, ERPT is likely to be higher when the
local market is closer to perfect competition
and when local demand is strong.

Impact on Trade Volumes
6.

Conditioned on some ERPT to

relative prices, the volume of imports and
exports may change. What is relevant here is
the size of the price change and the
substitutability of the goods in
consumption/domestic production in the case
of imports, and domestic supply conditions in
the case of exports. In fact, quantity responses
may not be linear to price changes, with
adjustment occurring only above some
minimum price change threshold, or only if the
price change is seen as permanent.
7.

On the import side, an increase in

alternative to imported raw materials or hitech goods is available, the reduction in
imports may be modest. If imported
intermediates are used in the production of
exports, a depreciation—by raising the
quantity of exports—may actually increase the
derived demand for imports. Indeed, if the
import content of exports is very high—and
hence the domestic content is very low—
imports (and exports) may not be very
sensitive to the bilateral local/foreign currency
exchange rate.
8.

On the export side, the potential to

expand supply in the short run depends on
the availability of spare capacity. If exporters
are operating at full capacity and the cost of
adjusting to a higher level of output is high,
export volumes may be inflexible in the short
run. In addition, scope to increase exports also
depends on the strength of external demand,
although there may be potential to gain
market share from suppliers in other countries.

Turkey’s lira-denominated export

and import prices have risen broadly in line
with the nominal depreciation, but import
prices have risen by slightly more. This
conforms with anecdotal evidence that prices
of imported luxury goods, such as cars and
high-end electronics, have risen rapidly (even

While high import ERPT might

likely to diminish this effect. More than
65 percent of total imports are raw materials

consumer imports may be price elastic, the

currency-denominated export prices fell

However, non-tradable prices were not
sufficiently flexible on the downside to prevent
a sharp increase in the general price level,
reducing the amount of real depreciation and
muting the increase in the price of imports
relative to nontradables.

Scope to expand export volumes is

constrained in the near term by the limited
domestic spare capacity in major export
sectors. Capacity utilization in some of the top
export sectors—textiles, wearing apparel, and
machinery—has returned close to the precrisis levels, though there is some room to
increase output in the vehicle and metal

exporters rely heavily on imported raw
materials and intermediates inputs. Increased
demand for imports to expand exports,
coupled with the higher cost of imports, will
limit the improvement in the trade deficit.
Moreover, these imports are generally priced
in the US dollars or in currencies closely linked
to the US dollar, while the main destination for
exports is the EU, and priced in euros. Hence,

To achieve a durable improvement

in the trade deficit requires a sustained real
depreciation. This, in turn, requires
containment of price and wage inflation to
narrow differentials with trading partners and
peer emerging markets that undermine
competitiveness. Fund staff projections
suggest that even if Turkey was to meet its
inflation targets over the medium term, its CPI
inflation would exceed most other peers.
Moreover, with energy accounting for nearly
one quarter of imports, scope to shift to
domestic replacements of imports is limited.
Thus, to lower its trade deficit, Turkey will need
to become more competitive in importreplacing and export sectors to cover the cost
of energy imports and still achieve a moderate
trade deficit.

1.

The CBT raised unremunerated

reserve requirements (URR) on banks’ liraand fx-denominated on-balance sheet
liabilities in several steps, beginning in
November 2010. Larger increases were
imposed on shorter-duration liabilities. The
goal of the revised URR policy was to slow the
growth of bank lending. This annex looks at
the mechanics of URRs and assesses the
effectiveness of the measure in Turkey.

If required reserves are remunerated at the market

WORLD BANK RELATIONS
1.

Turkey and the World Bank Group

have a strong partnership, which
continuously deepened over the last ten
years. As the global financial crisis and
economic downturn hit Turkey’s real economy
in 2008 and 2009, the World Bank Group
responded flexibly and quickly by (1)
increasing new International Bank of
Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)
financing, to US$2.08 billion in FY09 and
US$2.99 billion in FY10, and (2) re-focusing the
program on addressing the impact of the
crisis, in particular access to credit and jobs,
and supporting a return to sustainable growth
while also (3) expanding the program on

(January 2010). A new CPS, FY12-15, is
currently under preparation.
2.

By June 2011 Turkey was IBRD’s

second largest borrower with US$
12.9 billion outstanding. The CPS FY08–11
IBRD provided US$ 7.64 billion financing of
which US$ 6.44 billion in financing was
delivered in the last three fiscal years. IBRD’s
portfolio is large, focused and considerably
improved. Turkey’s active portfolio comprises

broadly adequate for surveillance purposes,
despite certain shortcomings. Turkey
subscribes to the Special Data Dissemination
Standard (SDDS).
Real Sector Statistics
2.

Data on producer and consumer

prices are published monthly, with a short
lag. Monthly data on industrial production
are published with a lag of five to six weeks.
The CPI and the PPI generally conform to
international standards. The methodology of
the CPI was improved with the introduction of
a 2003-based index, and this new CPI was
effective as of 2005. The methodology of the
CPI was further improved in 2009 regarding
the collection of telecommunication services
prices. The new CPI does not cover owneroccupied housing, commodities produced by
households for own consumption, and
expenditures on commodities obtained
through in-kind payments. The PPI is compiled
only by product (and not by economic activity).
3.

Quarterly national accounts are

the 1993 System of National Accounts (1993
SNA) methodology.
4.

In March 2008, revised annual and

quarterly estimates were released for 1998
onwards following the introduction of
ESA 1995 in Turkish National Accounts. The
new national accounts data implement the
main recommendations from the 2001 Data
Module of the Report on the Observance of
Standards and Codes (Data ROSC):
(i) improved estimation and deflation of
output and household consumption;
(ii) disaggregated deflation of trade in services
and inclusion of shuttle trade in exports of
goods; and (iii) improvement in the estimation
of selected aggregates. However, GDP time
series have not been constructed for years
prior to 1998. Work is underway aiming at
incorporation of data from annual collections,
the development of independent estimates of
household consumption, and further
enhancement of estimates for the nonobserved economy. A project recently initiated
aims at extending the scope of the accounts to

monthly, with a lag of some 2−3 weeks.
Coverage of the budget is incomplete, with
some fiscal operations conducted through
extra budgetary funds, for which data are
available only with long lags. Fiscal analysis is
further complicated by the omission of certain
transactions from the fiscal accounts, some
quasi-fiscal operations carried out by state
banks, state economic enterprises (SEEs) and
other public entities; and technical problems
associated with consolidating the cash-based
accounts of governmental entities with the
accrual-based accounting of SEEs. It is difficult
to reconcile fiscal data with monetary and BOP
data, especially in the accounting of external
debt flows and central government deposits.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with Turkey
On November 28, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Turkey.1
Background
The Turkish economy continued to grow strongly through the first half of 2011, reaping the
benefits of institutional reforms and revamped policy frameworks implemented in the previous
decade. However, growth became increasingly fueled by domestic demand and imports. This
was supported by strong credit growth, reflecting an appreciated currency combined with low
interest rates and a surge in short-term capital inflows. The current account deficit widened
sharply to near 10 percent of GDP. Inflation is rising quickly, reflecting pass-through from a
large nominal depreciation since late 2010, numerous tax and regulated-price increases, and
underpinned by tight domestic supply conditions, and is forecast to reach 9½ percent at end
2011, well above the point target of 5½ percent.
The externally-financed demand boom has weakened Turkey’s resilience in some areas.
Capital inflows are dominated by potentially-volatile financing, and short-term external debt has
climbed sharply. With banks absorbing much of these inflows, an external funding shortfall will
slow down credit. Nonfinancial corporates’ net FX liabilities increased substantially, exposing
them to currency depreciation. While the headline fiscal balance continues to improve and the

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
public debt-to-GDP ratio is declining, fiscal performance has been supported by benign
economic conditions at home and abroad.
Policy responses were insufficient to prevent the development of a large current account deficit
and high inflation. Monetary policy shifted to an unconventional mix of reserve requirements, the
interest rate corridor, and the policy rate, which has not demonstrated it can deliver price- or
financial–stability. Numerous prudential measures aimed at slowing credit growth and building
buffers were introduced but, from a macroprudential perspective, were sometimes delayed. The
primary balance of the nonfinancial public sector continued to improve, largely reflecting
buoyant—but transient—tax revenue from the boom in output and imports and proceeds from a
tax restructuring scheme, which masked a relaxed fiscal stance.
Growth is expected to slow sharply to 2 percent in 2012 due to weaker capital inflows, reflecting
in part concerns about Turkey’s large current account deficit. More limited foreign financing
would constrain the current account deficit to about 8 percent of GDP and compresses imports.
In line with Turkey’s previous capital flow-driven corrections, with fewer imports of key raw
materials and intermediates, GDP growth is forecast to be sharply scaled down. Inflation is
projected to decline to a still-elevated 6½ percent, eroding external competitiveness.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Turkish authorities for their agile economic management
during the global crisis, which, together with structural reforms undertaken earlier, had
contributed to a rapid recovery. Going forward, Directors urged the authorities to rebalance the
policy mix to ensure a soft landing, in view of volatile capital flows, a widening current account
deficit, and an externally financed credit boom. Tightening the structural fiscal position and
gearing macroprudential policies to preventing systemic risk would allow monetary policy to
focus on price stability, helping to preserve the credibility of the inflation-targeting framework
and strengthen Turkey’s resilience to changes in global liquidity conditions. It will also be
important to accelerate structural reforms to reverse eroding competitiveness and improve the
business climate, facilitating current account adjustment.
Directors welcomed the decline in public debt and the fiscal deficit. They encouraged the
authorities to tighten fiscal policy, with a view to stemming domestic demand, supporting
disinflation, while also providing a fiscal buffer in the event capital flows reverse. Directors
recommended front loading the adjustment as much as feasible, and establishing fiscal targets
in structural terms. They emphasized in particular the need to restrain current spending, expand
the tax base to ensure sustainable revenues, and strengthen the oversight of public-private
partnerships.
Directors acknowledged the difficult environment under which monetary policy operates. With a
tighter fiscal stance and appropriate macroprudential policies in place, they saw scope for
cautiously raising the single policy interest rate, taking into consideration the possible impact on
economic growth and capital flows. Directors recommended moving toward a more transparent
and consistent monetary policy framework to re-anchor inflation expectations and avoid
excessively rapid disintermediation. Narrowing the inflation tolerance band and gradually
lowering the inflation target will help moderate the impact of future capital flow cycles.

3
Directors noted the strong performance of the banking sector, but encouraged further efforts to
address weaknesses in the financial sector, in particular its vulnerability to an external funding
shock and possible deleveraging by banks in the region. They urged caution in implementing
near-term measures to bolster banks’ resilience so as to avoid a sharp drop in credit. Timely
detection and response to future emerging systemic risk is crucial, along with further
strengthening of financial sector oversight and regulation, as recommended in the Financial
Sector Stability Assessment. Directors saw an important role for the recently established
Financial Stability Committee in this regard. They underscored the importance of Turkey
bringing its Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism legislation into line
with international standards.
Directors endorsed labor and product market reforms to enhance competitiveness and social
equity. They recommended measures to enhance labor market flexibility, tailor training to
employers’ skill needs, and better align employment costs—including the minimum wage—with
regional peers. Timely adjustment of regulated energy prices to movements in the domestic
cost of imports would help lower Turkey’s energy trade deficit.

Statement by Mr. Willy Kiekens, Executive Director for Turkey and Mr. Omer Yalvac,
Senior Advisor to the Executive Director
November 30, 2011
Despite increased uncertainties in the global economy, the Turkish economy has maintained
strong growth during 2011. Its resilience is grounded in a strong fiscal position, political
stability, a well capitalized banking sector and skilful monetary policy. Political stability has
facilitated agile economic policies in response to global developments. The hard-won
credibility has been crucial in preserving confidence. A prudent fiscal stance has been one of
the key pillars of previous economic programs, and remains so in the new Medium-Term
Program. The strength of the banking sector allowed a sound credit expansion, thereby
supporting growth. Sound credit is closely monitored by the prudential supervision and
financial stability authorities. Monetary policy targets inflation while preserving financial
stability. Despite the strength of the economy, the authorities remain vigilant about the risks
and are ready to take necessary measures.
Growth
The Turkish economy grew strongly in 2010 and 2011, driven by strong private investment
and consumption. By contrast, because of prudent fiscal policies, the contribution of public
investment and consumption to growth was rather limited. With strong private-led growth,
the economy has created around 3.4 million jobs since April 2009, allowing the
unemployment rate to drop below 10 percent.
Strong private investment and consumption was fuelled by large foreign capital inflows and
significantly contributed to a widening current account deficit. The authorities, each within
their institutional mandate, and in light of global developments, have taken monetary, fiscal
and financial policy measures to rebalance growth. As a result, the latest data show signs
both of a slowdown in the economy and a moderation of the current account deficit.
The authorities target a 4 percent growth in 2012. The authorities are closely monitoring the
regional and global developments and acknowledge that the risks are downside.
Fiscal Policy
The fiscal balance has continued to improve and has exceeded the targets in the MediumTerm Program. The budget deficit in terms of GDP is expected to improve from 3.6 percent
in 2010 to 1.7 percent in 2011. Under the government’s most recent Medium-Term Program
the fiscal deficit should be further reduced to 1.5, 1.4, and 1 percent of GDP during the next
three years.
On the fiscal stance, the views of the authorities and of the staff differ to some degree. The
authorities appreciate the efforts of the staff in assessing Turkey’s structural fiscal position
and the extent to which fiscal revenues are transient. However there is no agreement in the

2
literature on how to calculate the structural fiscal balance and transient revenues. The
comments on the fiscal stance can be misleading without a consensus on the methodologies
applied.
The authorities consider the fiscal balance to be prudent. The public sector primary surplus is
expected to be 1.2 percent of GDP in 2011 of which 0.8 percentage points result from the
restructuring of public receivables. The remaining 0.4 percent of primary surplus exceeds the
target in the previous Medium-Term Program. For 2012, the public sector primary surplus
target is 1.1 percent, of which 0.3 percentage points are revenues from public receivables.
The remaining 0.8 percentage points of the primary surplus would be again higher than the
target in the previous Medium-Term Program.
The prudent fiscal stance and high growth have improved public debt sustainability. The EUdefined General Government debt-to-GDP ratio drops from 42.2 percent in 2010 to an
expected 39.8 percent in 2011.
The authorities are determined to take the necessary measures to strengthen the fiscal stance
and reduce imbalances in the economy. To moderate import demand while increasing fiscal
buffers, the government has recently raised indirect taxes on several categories of mainly
imported consumer durables. Domestic energy tariffs have been adjusted to avoid losses in
public energy companies.
Monetary Policy—External Balance
The Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) has pursued a non-conventional policy
shaped by domestic and external developments. The appreciation of the Turkish Lira (TL)
has been moderated by a series of policy measures which decoupled the behavior of the TL
exchange rate from other emerging market currencies. However, after the recent signs of a
further deterioration in the global markets, the authorities reversed their policies in line with
development in the financial markets.
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is expected to significantly overshoot its target by the end
of the year. The exchange rate pass-through and the recent adjustments in indirect taxes and
administrative prices help explain the surge in inflation. The monetary authorities have
tightened monetary policy to contain the second round effects of these temporary price
increases. In sum, the CBRT’s policy should help inflation converge to its end-2012 target.
The authorities share the concern of the staff that a heightened risk aversion and deleveraging
by European Banks could limit external financing for Turkey. The authorities are closely
monitoring the external conditions and are ready to take coordinated monetary, fiscal and
financial measures. The authorities took note of the staff’s recommendation to increase the
monetary policy rates. However, in a highly uncertain period and because of an expected
decline in growth next year, the authorities are cautious to tighten monetary policy under the
present circumstances.

3
Despite the rise in external debt, the banking sector, corporate sector and the households have
strong balance sheets and buffers. The external debt of the banking sector is only 13 percent
of total liabilities. This is low in comparison with other emerging market countries.
Additionally, banks have started to diversify their funding by issuing Eurobonds and TL
denominated securities. The nonfinancial corporate net FX liabilities have increased,
however short-term FX obligations are limited (i.e. around USD 15 billion). By contrast, the
households have a strong long FX position and almost no FX liabilities.
The newly established “Financial Stability Committee” will assume an important role in
coordinating the policies to address countercyclical adjustments and macro-financial stability
risks. This Committee is chaired by the Deputy Prime Minister for Economic and Financial
Affairs. The Committee consists of the Undersecretariat of Treasury, the Central Bank, the
Banking Regulation and Supervision Authority, the Deposit Insurance Fund, and the Capital
Markets Board. The Committee meetings will facilitate prompt coordinated action and better
integrate micro- and macro-prudential perspectives among the institutions.
Financial Sector
The banking sector remains adequately capitalized. Last September, the aggregate Capital
Adequacy Ratio (CAR) was 16.42 percent. The non-performing loan ratio has declined to
historical lows. The private sector credit now reaches 48 percent of GDP, which is still
comparably low. Funding is covered, in part by domestic bond issuances and external
financing. The latest Eurobond issuances of the banking sector have been positive in terms of
diversifying the investor base and lengthening the maturity.
The Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) Update has been completed. There has
been significant improvement since the latest FSAP. The stress test results confirm the
strength of the financial sector but call for more attention to the risks stemming from global
uncertainties. The banking sector’s capital buffers protect banks even when hit by large
shocks. The authorities welcome the FSAP’s policy recommendations. New AML/CFT
legislation to ensure compliance with international standards is on the agenda of the
Parliament.
The authorities are closely monitoring bank capital adequacy and credit growth. They will
take additional measures as needed. The risk weights for general purpose (consumer) loans
and general provisioning requirements for banks with high levels of consumer loans or nonperforming consumer loans have been increased. The Banking Regulation and Supervision
Agency (BRSA) has restricted the dividend payouts by banks with low CAR. The criteria for
assessing the minimum required CARs for foreign-owned banks have been modified to
minimize contagious external effects. New capital charges on large maturity mismatches to
discourage the duration gaps will come into force on July 1, 2012. Reserve requirements that
vary with the maturity of liabilities have increased the term structure of deposits thereby
reducing the maturity mismatch in the banks’ balance sheets. The authorities are also
preparing new regulation on credit risk management.

4
Structural Reforms
The authorities agree with the staff’s assessment that the current account deficit has deep
structural roots. They are determined to implement the reforms in the current Medium-Term
Program to improve the business climate and combating informality. Public investment will
focus on improving infrastructure and human capital. The country’s export capacity will be
strengthened. Energy efficiency will be enhanced and renewable and domestic energy
resources promoted. The flexibility and the quality of the labor force will be enhanced.
