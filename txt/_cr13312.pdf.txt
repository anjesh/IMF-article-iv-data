STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
July 2, 2013

KEY ISSUES
Context. Brazil is recovering gradually from the growth slowdown that started in mid2011, but the recovery remains uneven and inflation elevated. Output is estimated at
potential with supply-side constraints, linked to tight labor market conditions and
protracted weak investment since 2011, limiting near term growth. A monetary
tightening cycle has started, following a period of easing. In staff’s view, excessive fine
tuning of fiscal policy (including through public banks) has weakened the credibility of
Brazil’s long-standing fiscal framework, while broader policy uncertainty has weighed on
investment. Staff’s estimates of potential growth have been revised down and the
challenges posed by eroding competitiveness and economic imbalances remain—
notably low saving and investment. The Article IV consultation mission took place during
May 13–24.
Outlook and Risks. The recovery is expected to continue during 2013–14, supported by
a pick-up in investment and resilient consumption. The near-term outlook envisages
continued monetary tightening, broadly unchanged fiscal policy, and sustained
implementation of infrastructure investment. Domestic risks are to the downside, linked
to more sluggish investment and intensified inflationary pressures, worsening the
growth-inflation tradeoff. Lack of timely policy tightening would exacerbate existing
imbalances and weaken confidence in the fiscal framework. External risks are associated
with global financial conditions and commodity prices. Over the medium term, a
substantial scaling up of investment will be necessary to boost potential growth.
Policies. With supply-side constraints restraining short-term growth, a tightening policy
stance is needed to rebalance demand, including a steady fiscal consolidation, winding
down policy lending, and continued monetary tightening. Strengthening Brazil’s longstanding fiscal framework to rebuild fiscal buffers and bolster confidence would entail
adherence to a primary balance that puts gross debt firmly on a downward path;
maintaining sub-national fiscal discipline; easing rigidities to increase public saving; and
more fully recognizing contingent fiscal risks. The flexible exchange rate remains the
main shock absorber for global turbulence, while intervention should aim to limit
disorderly market conditions. The renewed focus on supply-side policies is welcome but
in order to increase potential growth, decisive and comprehensive efforts are needed to
enhance productivity and competitiveness, increase investment, and mobilize domestic
saving.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
1.
Brazil’s economy is recovering gradually from the slowdown that began in mid-2011.
Despite a substantial easing in monetary and fiscal policies since 2011, growth has been weaker and
more uneven than was envisaged after bottoming in the third quarter of 2011. The early stages of
the recovery were marked by resilient consumption and weak investment amid global uncertainty
and diminished business confidence, and real GDP growth stayed below 1 percent in 2012 (Box 1).
Notwithstanding a recent pick-up in investment, the economy is estimated to be operating close to
potential and remains subject to supply-side constraints that hold back the near-term pace of
recovery below its medium-term potential growth rate and exacerbate inflationary pressures.
2.
Growth has been supported mainly by consumption, with some rebalancing towards
investment more recently. Since 2011, Brazil’s dependence on consumption-based growth has
intensified as investment and net exports fell. The initial decline in investment in 2011 was
associated with a deteriorating external backdrop and a steady loss of competitiveness, but since
early 2012 other domestic factors, notably increased uncertainty about policies, seem to have
become more important. More recently, investment has begun to recover as business confidence
has stabilized and capacity utilization has reached cyclical highs. Private consumption growth slowed
in the first quarter of 2013, but fundamental support for household spending remains in place.
These include very low unemployment (notwithstanding a moderation in net job creation more
recently) and broad real wage gains (owing in part to a large rise in the minimum wage during
2012).
3.
Supply-side constraints have restrained near-term growth and exacerbated
inflationary pressures. Inflation has remained above the 4½ percent target mid-point for almost
three years, notwithstanding recent large reductions in household energy tariffs and tax cuts for
food staples, which together are estimated to have helped shave off about ¾ percentage point in
the headline index. Core inflation has also picked up and is near the ceiling of the tolerance band,
while non-tradables inflation—reflecting robust consumption demand—has accelerated to almost
10 percent. Staff estimates that the unemployment rate is below the NAIRU and this has contributed
to demand-pull and cost-push inflationary pressures (See Annex II). Medium-term inflation
expectations have deteriorated in tandem, with surveys now anticipating inflation above the target
mid-point over a 3-year horizon.
4.
The external current account deficit has widened. The deficit rose to 2.4 percent of GDP,
up from 2 percent the previous year and compared to a current account norm estimated at about
1 to -2 percent of GDP. Worsening terms of trade accounted for 0.1 percent of GDP of the increase
in the deficit, mainly due to lower prices of commodity exports. Trade flows with Argentina have
stabilized and begun to pick up following a large contraction during the first half of 2012. Import
growth was close to zero in 2012 but has begun to pick up more recently as capital goods imports
rise in tandem with domestic investment. Export volumes declined across the board, including for

Box 1. What Explains Weak Investment in Brazil?
Investment in Brazil has been remarkably weak since mid-2011. Gross fixed capital formation stood
about 5 percent lower than its peak 2011 level at the end of 2012 and, although it has since picked up, the
recovery remains uncertain. Investment growth slowed across emerging market economies following the
post-crisis recovery, but on average has continued to expand. In contrast, starting in 2011 Brazil’s investment
stalled then began to contract. Manufacturing capacity utilization near cyclical highs despite weak output
(Figure 1, middle right chart), suggests that industry has been a major contributor to this investment decline.
What explains this poor investment performance?

Commodity prices, growth expectations, and measures of uncertainty, both domestic and global,
have been the most important drivers of quarterly variation in overall investment growth in recent
years. Variance decompositions of investment growth identify implied U.S. equity volatility (VIX) and
commodity prices as the two key spillover channels to Brazil. Domestically, expectations for output growth
and investor uncertainty appear to play a key role. In particular, regressions indicate that the dispersion of
market forecasts for output growth over the next 12 months was highly significant but other domestic
variables including the real interest rate, the real exchange rate, and business confidence were not significant
in this model (Text Table).

Box 1. What Explains Weak Investment in Brazil? (concluded)
While global factors explained some part of the initial period of weak investment, domestic factors
have been more important since the start of 2012. A simple model does a good job of explaining
investment during the initial weakness between mid-2011 and the first quarter of 2012. Falling commodity
prices and tighter global financial conditions mainly contributed to the sharper-than-expected decline in
investment in 2011. However, since the start of 2012, the improving global environment has failed to ignite
an investment pick-up, as was predicted by the model and observed in other emerging markets. Instead,
deteriorating domestic factors, notably persistent downgrades to growth and greater uncertainty about the
outlook, appear to have weighed on investment.

The puzzle of weak investment has not been fully solved, however. While the preceding analysis
suggests that domestic factors have become more important it does not provide a structural explanation
and does not provide much guidance on whether the decline is permanent or transitory. Some potential
underlying factors may be unwound quickly, including the impact of domestic policy uncertainty on the
investment climate. Other factors may take more time, notably the steady erosion of competitiveness (only
partially reversed in 2012) and the apparent decline in productivity.

primary and manufactured products. In the first quarter of 2013, the 12-month current account
deficit has widened further reflecting weaker external demand, temporary disruptions in oil
production, and larger income payment outflows.
5.
The real exchange rate depreciated in the last 12 months, most recently as part of a
broad realignment across emerging markets, but rising unit labor costs have limited the gains
in competitiveness. Brazil’s real effective exchange rate has depreciated by 9 percent during the
12 months through April 2013. At the same time, unit labor costs in U.S. dollars have remained
broadly unchanged at almost 45 percent above pre-Lehman levels, as the effects of the weaker
currency have been offset by rapid real wage growth and stagnant labor productivity. A range of
metrics and methodologies suggests that the real exchange rate, at end-April, was overvalued by
about 10–15 percent based on current policies (See Annex I). Since early May, the nominal effective
exchange has depreciated by about 8–10 percent, somewhat higher than other major emerging
markets with flexible exchange rates but consistent with previous episodes of sudden increase in
global risk aversion.

6.
Net capital inflows, particularly portfolio flows, subsided through 2012, a tendency
that has been exacerbated by the recent volatility in global financial markets. Net portfolio
inflows have averaged about US$1 billion per month since the first quarter of 2012, about
US$3 billion less per month than monthly flows recorded during 2010–11. The weaker growth
outlook for Brazil, lower interest rates, and the series of capital flow measures (CFMs) have all
contributed to lower net inflows. More recently, global financial turbulence and higher global risk
aversion have further dampened net portfolio inflows to Brazil, notwithstanding the increase in
interest rates and the easing of CFMs. Foreign purchases of Brazilian equities have also been
subdued, probably reflecting the deterioration in growth prospects and profitability. Direct
investment inflows, however, have remained strong (almost 3 percent of GDP in 2012), with FDI
increasingly directed to the domestic services sector (Box 2). International reserves have remained
broadly stable following a halt in reserves accumulation since mid-2012; as of end-May 2013,
international reserves stood at US$375 billion, compared to US$352 billion at end-2011.
7.
Financial conditions have tightened but credit growth remains relatively strong, driven
by public bank lending. Notwithstanding the recent increase in domestic interest rates across the
yield curve, rates remain low compared to historical levels and market conditions have remained
orderly. Equity prices have declined and corporate debt and equity issuance has slowed in line with
other major emerging markets. Credit growth has slowed from its peak in 2010 but has remained
relatively strong, with lending by public banks outpacing that of private banks (growth rates of
25 and 10 percent respectively, over the past 12 months). Private banks’ NPLs have declined since
mid-2012, when they reached 5.4 percent, while public banks’ NPL have remained stable at about
2 percent. Mortgage lending has grown strongly, at annual rates close to 40 percent, but remains a
relatively small share of total credit. Prices of premium property in some large cities, though
moderating, have continued to increase. In turn, the authorities have made progress in
implementing key recommendations of the 2012 FSAP Update, including issuance of regulations on
positive-credit bureau and change in board composition of the deposit insurance fund (Box 3).

Box 2. FDI in Brazil
Brazil has received significant foreign direct investment inflows over the last decade. Annual FDI
flows averaged 2½ percent of GDP between 2003 and 2012, helping to finance the current account
deficit. The sectoral composition of FDI has remained relatively broad, with shares of investment in mining
and agriculture increasing in the mid-2000s, amid the commodity price boom, and inflows into services
rising later on. Investment in the manufacturing sector has been broadly stable at about 1 percent of GDP,
primarily into metallurgy, machinery, pharmaceuticals, and chemical products.
The stock of foreign direct investment liabilities account for about one half of Brazil’s gross foreign
liabilities. FDI gross liabilities have increased to 25 percent of GDP in 2012, comprising primarily of equities,
while intercompany loans account for about 1/5. Based on ultimate country of origin, the U.S. and European
economies account for ¾ of the stock of total FDI liabilities.
FDI is expected to play an important role in financing Brazil’s infrastructure and energy over the
medium term. Foreign investment is expected to contribute to development of infrastructure concessions
(with estimated investment needs up to $150 billion over the next 5 years). In addition, there will be an
increase in inflows into the oil sector related to recent and forthcoming auctions of oil fields.1

Box 3. Brazil: Status of Implementation of 2012 FSAP Key Recommendations1
The latest FSAP, undertaken in March 2012 and discussed by the Board in July 2012, found that
Brazilian financial system was stable, with low levels of systemic risk and sizable buffers. Flexible
exchange rate, strong microprudential policy frameworks, high capital adequacy ratio, and ample liquidity
asset, provided significant risk mitigants. However, the FSAP stressed that some key challenges remain:
x
Enhance macroprudential policy framework to effectively monitor and manage systemic
risks, by issuing regulation on positive credit bureaus, publishing a better house price index, and creating
a multi-partite, high level committee with an explicit macroprudential mandate.
x
Improve financial safety nets and crisis management, by strengthening the procedures for use
of the deposit insurance fund, enhancing the central bank’s emergency liquidity assistance, removing
impediments to bank resolution tools, and extending legal protection for microprudential agencies and
employees.
x
Undertake financial sector reforms to move the system away from the low duration and
high interest rate environment, by providing incentives for longer duration and infrastructure
investments, and re-focusing Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Econômico e Social (BNDES, Brazilian
Development Bank) to support private long-term finance.
x
Strengthen insurance and pension oversight, in particular, by ensuring adequate operational
autonomy and legal protection for supervisors.
x

Establish a dedicated consumer financial protection unit.

The authorities have made significant progress in implementing the recommendations, including:
issuing regulation on positive credit bureau, publishing a house price index, improving financial safety
nets, strengthening the resolution framework, extending tax incentives to infrastructure Fundos de
Investimentos em Direitos Creditórios (FIDCs, Receivable Investment Funds), facilitating long-term financing
by BNDES, and appointing a deputy governor and establishing a dedicated consumer financial protection
department in the Banco Central do Brasil (BCB, Central Bank of Brazil). Regarding a recommendation to
create a multi-partite, high-level financial stability committee, the authorities mention that there is no onesize-fits-all model and the current system with the Conselho Monetário Nacional (CMN, National Monetary
Council) and the Comitê de Regulação e Fiscalização dos Mercados Financeiros, de Capitais, de Seguros, de
Previdência e Capitalização (COREMEC, Committee for the Regulation and Supervision of the Financial,
Securities, Insurance, and Complementary Pension) has been fully functional to deal with systemic risk
monitoring and crisis management. Staff noted that considering the recommendations of the FSAP
Update can further benefit the effectiveness of the macroprudential policy frameworks.

resources); and secure adequate funding for the FGC in the
event of a systemic crisis.
6. Remove legislative impediments and strengthen the
purchase and assumption and bridge bank statutes.
7. Extend legal protection to all financial sector supervisory
agencies, and elevate the threshold for actions against
employees of these agencies, BCB-appointed directors,
interveners, or liquidators to gross negligence.
8. Extend tax incentives on infrastructure bonds to
infrastructure FIDCs.

9. Issue stricter market-making rules, e.g., apply a narrow
set of the same benchmarks to all market makers, linked to
improved incentives, e.g., access to Ministry of Finance
(MOF)’s securities lending facilities.
10. Shift BNDES operations towards co-financing with
institutional investors of a broader set of companies and
projects to provide market access and facilitate long-term
financing.
11. Provide Superintendência de Seguros Privados (SUSEP,
Superintendency of Private Insurance) and
Superintendência de Previdência Complementar (PREVIC,
Superintendency of Complementary Pensions) with the
same legal status as Comissão de Valores Mobiliários (CVM,
Securities and Exchange Commission) (e.g., fixed-term
appointments and clear mandates for board members).
12. Issue a secondary regulation on brokers’ selfregulation, which should include a mandatory affiliation to
the self-regulating entity, and closely supervise its
implementation.

After a prolonged period of policy easing, the authorities have started to focus on
alleviating supply-side constraints and containing inflation. The initial policy response to the
slowdown of 2011 consisted of relaxing the policy stance to boost domestic demand, but supply
constraints and weak investor confidence (in part related to private sector’s perceptions of high
policy uncertainty) rendered this approach ineffective. The authorities have more recently switched
their focus to measures aimed at alleviating bottlenecks and bolstering the supply response
(including through infrastructure concessions), and have started to tighten monetary conditions to
contain inflation.
x

Monetary and exchange rate policy. In April 2013, the central bank started a monetary tightening
cycle; the policy rate has been raised by a total 75 basis points, to 8 percent. This followed a
cumulative cut of 525 basis points in the policy rate during 2011–12 (that brought the rate to a
decades-low of 7¼ percent). As a result, the real ex-ante policy rate, at about 2½ percent,
remains below the neutral rate, and the monetary policy stance remains loose. Furthermore, the
effectiveness of monetary policy appears to have been reduced during the easing cycle due to a
temporarily weakened credit channel.1 The market response to recent rate hikes and stepped-up
central bank forward guidance has been positive and orderly, with medium- and long-term real
interest rates remaining below the levels reached in past tightening cycles. Inflation
expectations, in turn, show early signs of an inflexion point. In recent months, the central bank
also has intervened in both sides of the foreign exchange market, mainly through nondeliverable swaps, with little impact on international reserve levels. These interventions have
been geared at containing exchange rate volatility.

x

Fiscal policy and policy lending. During 2012, the authorities adopted several measures,
particularly tax stimuli, that ran counter to the fiscal consolidation initially envisaged in the
budget (Box 4). The fiscal primary surplus in 2012 (excluding proceeds from the sovereign
wealth fund), closed at 2.1 percent of GDP and the authorities had to use all budget
adjustors/deductions allowed by the budget, as the recourse to extraordinary revenue was
insufficient to compensate for higher current expenditures and the cost of stimulus measures.2
Net lending to public banks also increased by 1.5 percent of GDP in 2012. Stimulus measures
have continued in 2013, including a broadening of payroll tax cuts and an extension of tax
incentives for car purchases.

The 2012 budget targeted a primary surplus equivalent to 3.1 percent of GDP, but allowed through the use of
adjustors (pre-authorized discretionary adjustments to the target) for a lower outturn of up to 0.9 percent of GDP,
provided that the additional spending was on specific public investment projects under the Growth Acceleration
Program (PAC).

Box 4. Brazil: Fiscal Stimulus
In response to the sharp deceleration in activity since 2011, the authorities have introduced several
rounds of fiscal stimulus. Following an initial round at the end of 2011 (mostly aimed at supporting
consumption and the construction sector), several other rounds of stimulus were announced in 2012 and
2013.1 These subsequent rounds renewed or expanded the original stimulus measures while increasingly
focusing on supply side considerations, in particular labor and energy costs, and inflation control. The table
below accounts for the most significant measures taken since end-2011, with the estimated impact on the
fiscal accounts for 201214.

In August 2011, the government launched a broad program to support the external competitiveness of Brazilian
industries (Plano Brasil Maior). This program included tax incentives for the purchase of capital goods, financial support
for investment (mostly though BNDES), and tax incentives for exporters, particularly in labor intensive industries. Several
of the measures included in the Box Table are extensions/renewal of those in the original Plano Brasil Maior.

Box 4. Brazil: Fiscal Stimulus (concluded)
Most stimulus measures took the form of tax incentives. The federal government has repeatedly
renewed and expanded tax cuts on the consumption of durables, particularly home appliances and
automobiles/trucks (introduced first in August 2011). Similarly, the exemption of employer social
contributions (replaced by a tax on gross revenue), initially applied to a few (tradable) sectors was
subsequently expanded to many other activities, including retail. Such exemptions, along with some of
consumption tax cuts, will likely become permanent. The reform to the PIS/Cofins (social contributions levied
on consumption) has been under discussion.

x

Structural policies. Since the fall of 2012, the authorities have undertaken targeted efforts to
bolster investment by boosting infrastructure and reducing high energy costs, but
complementary tax reform efforts have stalled. The centerpiece of the authorities’ efforts has
been a program to increase private participation in infrastructure investment through the tender
of concessions for the operation of new roads, ports and airports (anticipated for the second
half of 2013) and a Public-Private Partnership model for railroads. Additional programs have
focused on airports and seaports. These programs are expected to generate new investments of
about R$159 billion (3 percent of GDP) over the next 5 years. Efforts to simplify the complex
inter-state VAT regime, highlighted by business surveys as burdensome and a deterrent to
investment, have stalled in the legislature. At the same time, the industrial sector has seen its
energy costs decline by an average 18 percent in 2013 due to the government’s renegotiation of
contracts with utility companies.3

x

Macroprudential policy and capital flow measures (CFMs). The macroprudential policies adopted
by Brazil in 2010–11 have been partially unwound in recent months, mainly through reducing
effective reserve requirements and easing sectoral capital requirements. The CFMs have
continued to be managed actively, with the coverage and rate of the IOF tax being adjusted
many times in response to changing financial conditions and market pressures. Over the last
12 months, CFMs have been eased by narrowing the coverage of the IOF tax (first by reducing
the maturity of debt inflows subject to the tax and then applying a zero rate on fixed income
inflows, and exempting certain investment vehicles). More recently, the IOF tax applicable to
short FX derivative positions was reduced to zero percent (Table below).

3

Some private sector analysts consider that the benefits of this renegotiation may have been partially offset by the
adverse private sector reaction to what was perceived as excessive government intervention in the energy sector.

Trade policies. In the second half of 2012, Brazil raised tariffs on imports of 100 goods; the goods
belong to many sectors and the imports had represented about 4 percent of total merchandise
imports in 2011. Tariff rates were increased up to a maximum of 25 percent, below the 35
percent ceiling consistent with WTO obligations. Import tariffs have remained broadly
unchanged since then.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
9.
The gradual recovery that started in 2012 is expected to continue through 2013,
supported by a sustained pick-up in investment. Real GDP growth is projected to rise to about
2½ percent this year, below medium-term potential growth because of supply-side constraints, with
fixed investment growing by about 7 percent in real terms. Infrastructure build-up will take time to
relieve bottlenecks, but a decisive advance on concessions (including in the energy sector) may help
bolster business confidence and private investment (given synergies between infrastructure
upgrades and returns on private capital). Private sector investment can have a more immediate
effect on growth, particularly as it relates to overdue upgrades and expansion of existing capacity
(which would imply higher imports). Consumption is expected to remain resilient as the labor
market stays buoyant, with a more moderate increase in the minimum wage supporting a
sustainable pace of household spending. Improving confidence, the lagged effects of the policy
stimulus of 2011–12, high rates of capacity utilization, and unencumbered corporate balance sheets
(Box 5) would underpin the recovery in investment. Net exports are likely to impart a small negative
contribution as improving external conditions are offset by higher investment-related imports and
weak competitiveness. Over the medium term, Brazil is projected to achieve potential growth of
about 3½ percent (a downward revision of staff’s and market estimates). Even this lower potential
growth will require scaled-up investment (including infrastructure) and an associated improvement
in productivity growth (Box 6). Absent comprehensive and decisive reform efforts to boost
investment and productivity, Brazil’s potential growth would revert to its long-term historical
average of about 3 percent.

Box 5. Brazil’s Corporates: Rising Leverage But Improving Liquidity1
Brazil’s non-financial corporate sector has seen profitability decline during the recent economic
slowdown. For the median firm, the return on equity (RoE) and profit margin have fallen from their cyclical
2010 highs. This trend has coincided with a large increase in unit labor costs during this period, and helped
explain the weak performance of investment since 2011. These results should be considered with caution
because many firms have yet to report comprehensive financial results.2

Firms are increasing leverage but the median rate remains relatively contained. Leverage, defined as
total debt to common equity, broadly increased from 2009–11 but stabilized last year and remains
somewhat above the historical average. The distribution of leverage has also become slightly more skewed,
pointing to a smaller number of firms with more highly leveraged balance sheets, but in line with Brazil’s
structure over the last decade.

comprehensive balance sheet information each year (hence, the sample changes every year reflecting the entry and exit
of firms). For end-year 2011, this sample included 255 firms. The second sample uses data for firms that have already
reported for 2012 and uses this same sample of firms each year. For end-year 2012, this sample included 164 firms and

Box 5. Brazil’s Corporates: Rising Leverage But Improving Liquidity (concluded)
At the same time, firms have taken advantage of benign financial conditions to lengthen average
maturity. The proportion of short-term firm debt at residual maturity has declined. This is likely contributing
to a more comfortable liquidity position, with various measures (including the quick ratio) showing that
liquidity has improved over the last decade. However, improving liquidity may also partly reflect cyclically
low interest rates.

Corporate bond issuance has picked up in the last three years, largely offset by a reduction in new
syndicated loans, with a greater proportion denominated in local currency. New issuances by the nontradable sector have largely been denominated in local currency in recent years. Syndicated loans are
principally to the tradable sector denominated in foreign currency. A large share of recent issuance has
facilitated balance sheet restructuring, including a lengthening of maturities, rather than the financing of
new investment. More recently, as global financial conditions have tightened, issuance has begun to
moderate in line with other major emerging markets.

Box 6. How Fast Can Brazil Grow?
Brazil’s weak performance since 2011 has re-ignited the debate about its medium-term potential
growth rate. Consensus estimates of potential growth have been steadily revised lower and are now at their
lowest level since commodity prices began to surge in the mid-2000s. Brazil is not alone in seeing its
potential growth rate revised lower with estimates for the larger emerging markets also being marked down.
A supply-side decomposition suggests that Brazil’s sustainable future growth rate is about
3½ percent, about ¾ percentage point lower than assumed by staff in recent years. This latest
estimate is about the same as the average real growth rate from 200012, while range of statistical filters,
show potential growth at 23½ percent.

To achieve growth of 3½ percent, Brazil will need to step-up investment, including in infrastructure,
and boost productivity above past levels. Over the next decade, the labor pool will expand at a slower
rate, reflecting demographic trends but also employment and participation rates at high levels. Growth will
need to rely more on capital accumulation and productivity. The projections below assume that: foreign
saving can finance only part of Brazil’s required investment needs; domestic saving will rise but only
gradually and will stay relatively low; and the government will successfully implement its program of
infrastructure investment with important positive effects on productivity. These estimates of potential
growth are subject to considerable uncertainty. In particular, if Brazil fails to attain higher productivity, the
risks are that long-term growth could fall short of even this downwardly revised estimate (see accompanying
Selected Issues Paper).

10.
Inflation is expected to fall gradually towards the mid-point of the target range.
Headline inflation is projected to remain at about 5¾ percent this year and into 2014, and converge
gradually to the target mid-point thereafter. The slow convergence to the target, even in the
absence of further supply shocks, will reflect: lags between the new investments and the expansion
of capacity; continued tightness in labor markets; the effects of exchange rate depreciation,
notwithstanding evidence that pass-through has declined in recent years; and inflation inertia which
appears to have increased.4
11.
The external current account deficit is projected to increase further through 2015,
partly as a result of the recovery of investment. Notwithstanding some cyclical improvement,
public and private saving are not likely to increase under current policies, which implies that the
pick-up in investment has to be financed by higher foreign saving. From a trade balance perspective,
the investment recovery and sustained strength in consumption will result in a significant rebound in
imports (considering the high income elasticities observed in previous cycles). Exports are projected
4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BRAZIL

to grow at a more gradual pace, while the terms of trade are anticipated to worsen somewhat. Over
the medium term, the external current account deficit would stabilize at about 3¾ percent of GDP
as pre-salt oilfields come online and Brazil becomes a net oil exporter.
12.
The baseline scenario is predicated on a continuation of monetary tightening, broadly
unchanged fiscal policy from last year, and successful implementation of infrastructure
programs. Monetary tightening would continue, bringing the real policy interest rate close to its
estimated neutral level by about mid-2014. Fiscal policy is expected to be consistent with a primary
balance of about 2 percent of GDP in 2013 and 2014 (though meeting those targets will require
strict expenditure restraint). This will require the full use of adjustors/discounts to the primary
balance target.5 Policy lending is projected to return to levels close to 1 percent of GDP in 2013 and
through 2015 and decline gradually thereafter, as public bank lending to finance infrastructure
concessions subsides.6

Domestic risks are to the downside in the near term, reflecting a deterioration in the
growth-inflation trade-off and the potential for policies to exacerbate imbalances. These risks
are linked.

5

The 2013 budget targets a primary surplus equivalent to 3.3 percent of GDP (under staff estimates of GDP), but preauthorized discretionary adjustors allow for a deduction of up to 1.4 percent of GDP, provided that this discretionary
room is used towards spending in specific public investment projects under the PAC and tax cuts.

x

Protracted weak investment, worsening demand imbalances and policy stance. If the factors
underlying weak investment and supply-side constraints are more protracted or structural in
nature (including for infrastructure investment), or investor confidence remains fragile, including
because of social discontent, the recovery could prove more uneven and sluggish than
envisaged in the baseline. If, in this context, further demand stimulus is added or if the policy
stance is not adjusted to bring about a rebalancing of domestic demand, the external current
account deficit would deteriorate more than projected and inflationary pressures would remain
elevated (Figure 2).

x

Gradual erosion of the fiscal framework. Brazil’s sound policy frameworks, including the fiscal
responsibility law (FRL), have been key for maintaining macroeconomic stability for over a
decade. In recent years, there has been an increasing reliance on extraordinary revenues and
adjustors to the primary balance target to meet the fiscal target and on large transfers to public
banks (policy lending); these actions and policies have started to undermine the credibility of the
policy framework and reverse the downward trend in the gross debt to GDP ratio (Box 7).7

x

Higher and more persistent inflation. Slow convergence towards the inflation target and elevated
medium-term inflation expectations have increased Brazil’s vulnerability to adverse supply
shocks. If domestic supply constraints prove more binding than expected, including those
stemming from the tight labor market, even a moderate pick-up in domestic demand could
forestall inflation convergence. Elevated inflation for a protracted period would affect inflation
expectations, increase indexation and inertia, and increase the sacrifice ratio of bringing inflation
back to target.

x

Correction in the real estate market and household credit exposure. Although Brazil’s large banks
retain substantial buffers against shocks (as identified in the July 2012 FSAP), a large correction
of property prices is likely to have adverse financial and real effects. The rapid expansion of
credit to new customers including households and small businesses, particularly among public
banks, may worsen asset quality and increase potential financial vulnerabilities in a low growth
scenario, particularly if labor market conditions were to weaken noticeably (Box 8).

7

The 2014 draft Budget Law contemplates, again, rather large adjustors to the primary balance target (of up to 1.4
percent of GDP), as well as a proposal to release the federal government from an obligation to cover primary balance
shortfalls at the sub-national level. In addition, the borrowing limits set annually by the central government to
support state-level investment have been increased in recent years.

Box 7. Brazil: Public Debt Dynamics in Recent Years
Fiscal responsibility has been instrumental to lower Brazil’s public debt. The ratio of gross debt to GDP
for the non-financial public sector has declined gradually during the past decade. Many years of robust
primary surpluses and output growth have supported the decline in gross debt. Net debt has exhibited a
larger decline than gross debt reflecting the accumulation of financial assets, notably international reserves
and credit to public financial institutions.1

During this period, active debt management has also
improved the debt structure. The composition of public
debt has been strengthened as a result of lengthened
maturity; gradual replacement of FX debt and floating-rate
and FX-linked domestic securities by fixed-rate and
inflation-linked domestic debt; and lower share of nonresidents holding of government debt (including external
debt). However, roll-over needs remain large, with about a
quarter of domestic federal debt maturing every year.

significantly to gross public debt. Subsidized lending by the Treasury to public banks, in particular BNDES,
has explained a substantial rise in federal public debt. Treasury transfers to BNDES and other public banks
have added 8 percent of GDP to the stock of gross debt during 2008–12. In 2012, the increase in gross
public debt was driven by Treasury lending to public banks, which amounted to 1.5 percent of GDP (see
Figure 4). Policy lending has not affected the authorities’ definition of net debt as financial assets (public
bank obligations to the Treasury) have increased

accordingly.
The reduction in public debt has been a key
driver of the decline in the interest bill. More
recently, the reductions in the policy rate have also
favored debt dynamics. The policy rate cuts
implemented since August 2011 have helped reduce
the implicit interest rate by about 100 bps to
11½ percent in 2012.2 However, the sensitivity of the
interest bill to policy rate changes is relatively
limited, as less than a quarter of total gross debt
consists of floating rate securities.

Household NPLs have decreased by 0.5 pp from the peak in May 2012 (6.0 percent), and are expected
to continue declining. A significant part of the decline in the delinquency rate has been due to auto and
mortgage loans, which represent a large share of household credit, 17.8 and 24.0 percent, respectively.
Leading delinquency indicator points to the declining trend continuing, associated with a sustained output
recovery and favorable labor market conditions.

External downside risks are mainly associated with global financial conditions and
commodity prices.
x

Global financial conditions. Notwithstanding the steady improvement in Brazil’s international
investment position and its large foreign reserve buffers, Brazil’s continued reliance on foreign
saving and its highly integrated financial markets leave it vulnerable to swings in global financial
conditions. Key risks are associated with the global financial implications of a sudden or sharp
monetary tightening in the U.S. or contagion from an intensification of the crisis in Europe,
either of which could prompt an increase in global risk aversion, lower flows to emerging
markets, and tighter external financing conditions. If these risks were to materialize and cause a
sharp and persistent depreciation of the real, inflationary pressures would increase
(notwithstanding the lower exchange rate pass-through of recent years) and monetary policy
would have to be tightened accordingly to pin down inflation expectations and preserve price
stability. Significantly tighter domestic and external financing conditions may hinder the
expected recovery in investment, including the infrastructure concessions program.
Vulnerabilities directly linked to the banking system, however, appear to be low, with external
liabilities of Brazilian banks accounting for 7 percent of bank assets and foreign banks, mostly
funded locally, representing less than 20 percent of banking sector assets.

x

Commodity prices and terms of trade. Exports of commodities represented almost half of Brazil’s
total goods exports in 2012, making the external position highly vulnerable to large changes in
commodity prices. However, although the prices of Brazil’s four main commodity exports—iron
ore, soybeans, coffee, and sugar—are highly volatile, their cross-correlation is relatively low
suggesting that the vulnerability would be large only in the event of a global demand shock.

15.
Brazil’s medium-term challenges are to bolster growth through higher productivity
and investment, while mobilizing domestic saving to keep the external current deficit at
moderate levels. Brazil has to raise total factor productivity and investment to attain stronger,
sustainable growth. Without a concomitant rise in domestic saving, however, high investment would
widen Brazil’s already high current account deficit. For example, if Brazil’s investment to GDP ratio
were to increase to average G-20 levels but the domestic saving rate were to remain unchanged the
external current account deficit would deteriorate by about 4 percentage points of GDP. Scaling up
Brazil’s investment sufficiently to boost potential growth above its historical average is likely to
require a sustained rise in domestic saving of about 2–3 percentage points of GDP, with a
contribution of both public and private savings. Some increase in foreign saving will be necessary to
finance higher investment, including in the infrastructure and energy sectors, over the medium term.
If the bulk of that foreign saving takes the form of foreign direct investment, there would be positive
effects, including on productivity, which would allow Brazil to sustain a potential growth rate of
about 3½ percent. To the extent that the higher current account deficit is financed with more
volatile sources of capital, Brazil’s external vulnerabilities would increase.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Policy discussions centered on near term supply-side constraints and their implications
for the growth-inflation trade-off, how to strengthen Brazil’s long-standing policy
frameworks, and options to boost long-term growth.

A. Economic Outlook and Risks
16.
The authorities anticipate a continuation of the economic recovery and a sustained
pick-up in private investment. The investment recovery is expected to be supported by past and
current policy stimulus and recent progress in boosting private sector participation in infrastructure
investment. Staff agreed that investment was picking up but argued that greater efforts, including
greater policy predictability and measures to rebalance domestic demand and enhance
competitiveness, would be important to strengthen investor confidence and raise growth on a
sustained basis.

24

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BRAZIL

17.
They consider that the main risks to the outlook are external. The authorities cited the
prospect of tighter global financial conditions, including the eventual unwinding of monetary
stimulus in the United States, as a key risk to emerging markets (notwithstanding Brazil’s substantial
buffers). Sharp and prolonged falls in commodity prices, stemming from a sharp slowdown in China,
and further disruptions to trade among regional partners are also considered key risks. Staff agreed
with these external risks and emphasized that domestic risks also remain material, particularly those
related to the policy frameworks and the policy stance.

B. Near-Term Policy Stance
18.
The authorities indicated that they would tighten macro policies, including fiscal
policy if the recovery proceeds as anticipated. The central bank has recently stepped up the pace
of monetary tightening and signaled that it would take the actions necessary to lower inflation
towards the mid-point of the official target range. The authorities at the Ministry of Finance
indicated that they were expecting an output growth rate above 3 percent in 2013; under such
scenario, they would not consider additional stimuli in 2013 and the fiscal primary surplus would
improve slightly this year.8 Staff welcomed these policy intentions and noted that supply constraints,
due in part to weak investment and a tight labor market, would likely limit the strength of the
recovery. Staff underscored that a gradual fiscal consolidation was necessary in the months ahead,
to rebalance demand and support monetary policy.

Fiscal policy
19.
The authorities consider that fiscal policy can continue to play an important countercyclical role. They noted that recent stimulus has been aimed at boosting investment and
competitiveness and that after the normal lags, those measures will impact activity. They also noted
the contribution of the tax cuts granted by the government in the anti-inflation fight. Reductions in
payroll taxes and tax-exemption of basic consumer goods were viewed as permanent structural
measures, while other consumption and financial transaction-based taxes (such as the IPI, gasoline
taxes and the IOF) were used to respond to the cycle. Staff noted that the global financial crisis of
2008–09 had to be seen as an exceptional circumstance and that in more normal times monetary
policy was the lever that had to be geared at demand management through the business cycles;
fiscal policy contribution would normally had to be confined to the automatic stabilizers. Staff
indicated that the tax cuts recently enacted would tend to have a transitory effect in reducing
inflation and that by stimulating consumption and labor demand (amid cyclically low
unemployment) they would ultimately contribute to exacerbate inflationary pressures.
20.
They anticipate an improvement in the primary fiscal surplus in 2013 as the recovery
proceeds. The authorities noted that they did not anticipate further tax stimuli for this year and
were not planning to make full use of the adjustors/discounts to the primary balance target allowed
8

In recent weeks, the authorities have emphasized that the fiscal primary target for 2013 remains at 2.3 percent of
GDP, which implies a partial use of the discretionary adjustors allowed by the budget law.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

by the budget, provided that the recovery proceeds as expected. For sub-national governments they
expect some consolidation in 2013, with no extension of the PROINVESTE program to support
investment by state governments. This would imply a small increase in the primary surplus of the
general government compared to last year. Staff noted that growth may turn out to be lower than
the “3 percent plus” expected by the government, because of limited supply response. Staff
supported a credible path of gradual fiscal consolidation, anchored on Brazil’s long-standing
primary surplus target (3.1 percent of GDP). It argued that such path of consolidation, as well as
greater clarity about the target and its rationale, would help rebalance demand, supporting
monetary policy, rebuild policy buffers, and bolster the recovery in confidence.
21.
Policy lending through public banks is expected to moderate. The authorities noted that
the recent expansion of public banks’ market share was aimed at filling the void left by private banks
(following the rise in NPLs in 2010–11), and that this process had likely concluded with greater
dynamism expected by private bank lending going forward.9 At the same time, they indicated that
public banks were expected to provide the bulk of the financing for the infrastructure and energy
concessions in coming years (between 70 and 80 percent). Staff noted that policy lending is a quasifiscal operation that affects the overall fiscal stance and debt dynamics. It argued that the private
sector had access to financing from private sources and that lowering policy lending was not likely
to have a major adverse impact on activity and should take priority in a fiscal adjustment process.

Monetary and financial policies
22.
There was broad agreement that reducing inflation and inflation expectations should
be the key priority of monetary policy. The central bank reiterated its commitment to inflation
targeting and indicated that the recent uptick in inflation was due, in part, to transitory food supply
shocks that should unwind through the year. In this context, the recent increases in the policy rate
and strengthened communications strategy would help reinforce their anti-inflation credentials. The
authorities agreed that inflation inertia may be becoming entrenched and noted that the current
policy action would help contain inflation expectations and facilitate a faster convergence of
inflation to the target. Staff noted that a frontloaded policy course may help limit the potential
sacrifice in terms of activity and the extent to which policy rates would need to rise through the
cycle.
23.
The flexible exchange rate remains a key pillar of Brazil’s macroeconomic policy
framework and continues to play a key role as shock absorber. The authorities noted that the
interventions in the foreign exchange market in recent months had been sporadic and symmetric,
and were aimed at moderating the volatility of the exchange rate, not at stabilizing the nominal rate
at a predetermined level. The authorities noted that the recent interventions had been done through
the swap market, avoiding a direct effect on international reserves, as this mechanism was deemed
to be most effective to reduce currency volatility. They indicated that reserve accumulation,

26

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BRAZIL

notwithstanding indications from staff that they are more than adequate based on standard metrics,
may be part of the policy response if large private capital inflows were to resume.
24.
Capital flow measures (CFMs) have helped insulate Brazil from large and volatile
capital flows and remain part of the policy toolkit. Since mid-2012, CFMs have been eased in
response to a large and sustained decline in gross and net portfolio inflows. The authorities noted
that the IOF, particularly on net derivative positions adopted at end-July 2011 (as well as bank
reserve requirements on short currency positions), dampened short-term portfolio inflows and
contributed to financial stability. They acknowledged that CFMs, particularly when used actively and
applied to a broad variety of flows, involve important trade-offs, but are of the view that, overall, the
stability benefits more than offset the potential adverse impact on investors’ sentiment. The
authorities indicated their intention to continue managing actively the IOF, with the rate and
coverage adjusted in response to capital flow pressures. Staff concurred that the IOF appears to
have been effective and that CFMs involved material trade-offs, and emphasized that to minimize
the negative effects (including on preserving deep derivative markets) they should be well
integrated with other policies in the broader policy toolkit, and be temporary and nondiscriminatory.
25.
Staff recognized that the banking system is sound, but noted that the rapid expansion
of public bank balance sheets remains a concern. The authorities noted that overall bank credit
growth had moderated from its peak, NPL ratios had gradually declined, capital adequacy ratios are
among the highest in the G-20, and bank liquidity buffers remain ample. In addition, stress tests
done by the central bank indicate that the banking system can withstand large shocks, including to
economic growth, interest rates, and the exchange rate. The authorities acknowledged staff’s
concerns regarding the rapid expansion of public bank balance sheet but noted that the NPL ratios
at these institutions were much lower than at private banks, their liquidity position remains
comfortable, and they remain well provisioned for any potential deterioration in asset quality in the
future.
26.
Household balance sheets have improved and housing price increases have
moderated, but the authorities concurred that ongoing vigilance is warranted. The authorities
attributed the recent improvement in household NPLs, in part, to a structural change in banks’ credit
portfolio towards lower risk loans such as payroll and mortgage loans, the lagged impact of lower
interest rates, and the effect of macro-prudential measures adopted in 2010. Going forward, it will
be important to assess the effect of higher interest rates on delinquency rates. The central bank’s
new housing price index indicates that recent real estate price increases have been less pronounced
than previously thought and have started to moderate.10 The authorities shared the view that rapid
growth in mortgage loans (albeit from low levels) and the potential for feedback loops between
house prices and mortgage lending warrant close monitoring.

definition of the new housing price index.

BRAZIL

27.
There is sustained commitment to advance in the implementation of key financial
reforms. Brazilian banks have progressed well towards implementation of Basel III, in line or ahead
of the international calendar, which according to authorities’ estimates would require additional
capital for only a few banks over the medium term (Box 9). New measures implemented would
facilitate this process, including a revised law clarifying the status of deferred tax assets (DTAs) as
direct claims on the government, enabling their inclusion in common equity Tier 1 capital. The
authorities noted that good progress had been made in implementing key recommendations from
the 2012 FSAP Update, including new regulations establishing a positive credit bureau, publishing a
house price index, improving financial safety nets, and strengthening the resolution framework. They
acknowledged that legal complexities are an obstacle to faster progress in a few areas.
28.
The authorities underscored their commitment to support multilateral and regional
trade. Trade officials noted that the average level of Brazil’s common external tariffs has remained
broadly unchanged since mid-2012. After increasing tariffs on 100 products in late 2011, compliant
with the WTO, the authorities confirmed that the increase initially planned for an additional
100 products has been deferred indefinitely. At the same time, tariffs on some capital goods were
lowered in 2013, though the narrow scope of these measures implied little change at the aggregate
level.

C. Strengthening Brazil’s Policy Frameworks
29.
The authorities expressed the view that the current fiscal space is sufficient and that
fiscal policy should continue to have an active role, including in domestic demand
management. They noted that Brazil’s recent fiscal track record and lower interest rates had helped
reduce net debt as a percent of GDP, and that the maturity structure of public debt had improved,
and argued that both factors had increased fiscal space. Staff acknowledged the progress in
improving the structure of public debt, but highlighted that the gross debt to GDP ratio (an
indicator that is being monitored by market participants and, in contrast to the authorities’ net debt
definition, includes the debt associated with on-lending to public banks) had increased moderately
in recent years and remains elevated. Staff highlighted the important role that policy lending
through public banks had played in building up gross debt and indicated that controlling such
lending would have to be an important component of a credible debt reduction strategy. Staff
recommended giving greater priority to strengthening the fiscal framework that had served Brazil
well in the last decade. To this effect, it advised the authorities to set a target for the primary surplus
of the NFPS that allows less discretionary adjustment and that places gross debt back firmly on a
downward path.
30.
The authorities restated their commitment to maintain fiscal discipline at the subnational level. The mechanisms embedded in the Fiscal Responsibility Law and debt renegotiation
contract agreed with the federal government in the late 1990s have helped ensure fiscal discipline of
the sub-national governments. Staff encouraged the authorities to maintain these long-standing

28

Box 9. Brazil: Basel III Capital Requirements and Estimated Impacts1
The Banco Central do Brasil (BCB) has recently published a series of resolutions and circulars
implementing Basel III recommendations.2 The authorities seek to improve the banking sector’s ability to
absorb losses from shocks and reduce the risk of spillover from the financial sector to real economy. The
new rules will go into effect on October 1, 2013, and Brazilian banks will need to build a capital conservation
buffer and be subject to the requirement to hold a countercyclical capital buffer (should the authorities
determine it is needed) from 2016.3
BCB simulations show that banks have strong balance sheet and will be able to comply with the
regulatory requirements without the need to raise additional capital over the next years. In a scenario
with credit growth and earnings retention based on the average of recent years, no bank will need to raise
capital in 201316. Over the period 2017–19, some banks may need to raise about R$15 billion in total,
which represents just 2 percent of the total assets in the banking system at end 2012 (R$697 billion).

Setting the appropriate level of countercyclical capital buffer is a complex exercise. The Basel Committee has suggested
the use of a credit-to-GDP gap indicator, which assesses the growth of the credit-to-GDP ratio and whether it deviates
significantly from its long-term trend. The BCB has noted that it will use the gap indicator as one of several variables to
be considered. The BCB has also acknowledged that the decision of when to activate or disable the countercyclical buffer
is crucial for the tool to produce the desired effect and will require continuous monitoring of all the indicators of systemic
risk.

Box 9. Brazil: Basel III Capital Requirements and Estimated Impacts (concluded)
The revised Brazilian law allows Deferred Tax Assets (DTAs) derived from timing differences relative
to loan loss provisioning to be included in common equity Tier 1 (CET 1) capital.4, 5 Under the Basel
III accord, DTAs arising from timing differences relying on future profitability can normally be recognized as
CET 1 capital only up to 10 percent, with any remaining amount being fully deducted.6 However, following
the Italian model, under special circumstances, DTAs arising from timing differences relative to loan
loss provisioning can now be converted into “deemed credits” and become direct claims on the
government which can be drawn regardless of the existence of future profitability. As the DTAs are no
longer contingent claims and do not rely on the entity remaining a going concern, Basel III does not require
such credits to be deducted from the CET1 capital.7 As a result of the legal change, Brazilian banks can claim
back their DTAs relative to loan loss provisioning in cases of fiscal loss, bankruptcy or extrajudicial
liquidation. The costs of the legal change are estimated in R$2.84 billion over the 201416 period (R$851
million in 2014, R$945 million in 2015, and R$1.04 billion in 2016) and are acknowledged in the budget,
unlike the Italian model which has not allowed for these claims in its budget. The overall impact is to protect
the capitalization of the Brazilian banks and to strengthen their balance sheets with the explicit government
guarantee for such DTAs, although no deduction of the DTAs lowers overall quality of the CET 1 capital.
Regulation does not require investments in affiliated insurance companies to be deducted from the
CET 1 capital. The BCB requires the deduction of the insurance company’s minimum regulatory capital
requirements, but any “excess” capital investment beyond the regulatory minimum is not required to be
deducted. This treatment is not consistent with Basel recommendations that require the full deduction.
However, it is recognized that the simple full deduction, following the Basel recommendations, would have a
punitive impact on the capital of a bank holding an insurance subsidiary, which is a common structure in
Brazil. In addition to the deduction of minimum regulatory capital requirements, the parent must hold
capital in respect of the risk weighted assets its insurance subsidiaries. Due to this feature, the authorities
note that, depending on the mix of assets held by the insurance subsidiary, the treatment may be more
conservative than the simple full deduction in some cases. However, the subsidiary would have the ability to
manage its asset profile and consequently affect the capital held by the parent.
The BCB estimates that the impact of new regulations on the credit supply in Brazil would be neutral.
Brazilian banks have high levels of reserves, liquidity and capital, and full compliance with the recommended
schedule will help reduce the borrowing cost and expand access to external sources. The phase-in process
will allow any adjustment needed, while the publication of the resolutions and circulars will reduce
regulatory uncertainty. Banks and rating agencies have signaled that they are well prepared to adopt
Basel III capital requirements.

Provisional measure (Medida Provisória #608) passed on February 28, 2013.

5

Brazilian banks accumulate sizable DTAs because the BCB requires banks to build up expected loss provisions for all
loans overdue more than 15 days and 100 percent provision for nonperforming loans more than 180 days, but the tax
revenue agency in Brazil is conservative in recognizing losses, allowing the recognition of nonperforming loans only after
two years from the starting day of judicial procedures to recover the credit. In addition, the BCB requires 100 percent
provision for any losses due to other judicial processes, while tax laws only recognizes these losses when due.

6

According to International Accounting Standard, DTAs are the amounts of income taxes recoverable in future periods in
respect of: deductible temporary differences, the carry-forward of unused tax losses, and the carry-forward of unused tax
credits. Temporary differences arise when an expense is immediately booked under accounting standards, but can only
be fiscally deducted in future years; the amount of taxes that should be paid due to the temporary non-deductibility of
the expense generates DTAs.
7

The size of DTAs from loan loss provisioning in Brazil is estimated to be approximately R$ 64 billion, which amounts to
16 and 1 percent of Brazilian banks’ Tier 1 capital and total assets respectively as of end-2012.

mechanisms, and to retain cross-compensation with the federal government to meet the primary
target for the nonfinancial public sector.
31.
The authorities would like public banks to continue playing an important role in the
provision of long-term financing to the private sector. They indicated that public banks are
expected to retain a major role in the financing of infrastructure and energy concessions.
Accordingly, large transfers from the Treasury to public banks are envisaged to continue in coming
years, and taper down only gradually over the medium term. Staff indicated that, in some cases,
public banks may be important to complete “missing markets,” (for example, by providing long term
financing for smaller companies without market access), but pointed to evidence of competition
with private bank lending.

D. Domestic Demand Rebalancing and Boosting Long-Term Growth
32.
Programs aimed at boosting investment in infrastructure and energy are the
centerpiece of the government’s efforts to increase potential output growth. The authorities
cited progress in passing legislation paving the way for increased private participation in the
expansion and management of ports, recent airport concessions, and upcoming concessions aimed
at increasing road capacity along major arteries. Other recent advances include the successful
auction of oil exploration rights to 20 domestic and multinational energy companies. Staff
welcomed these developments and agreed that undertaking those investments, with appropriate
transfer of risks to the private sector, should contribute to upgrade the country’s capital stock and
raise productivity. This would be essential to boost potential growth, especially considering that
demographic trends would continue to moderate labor force growth.
33.
The authorities concur on the pressing need to increase the investment ratio, and
considered that it can largely be financed with foreign saving, particularly in the form of FDI.
They noted that Brazil’s net foreign asset position had improved in recent years, in part because FDI
now represents a larger share of foreign liabilities. The expansion of infrastructure and the ensuing
alleviation of critical bottlenecks is expected to generate a large payoff in terms of growth potential,
while the investment in the energy sector is anticipated to improve Brazil’s external position over the
medium term. Staff agreed that external vulnerabilities appear moderate at present and that there is
some space to rely on foreign saving for a few more years. At the same time, staff noted that a
higher domestic saving rate was needed to support the higher rate of investment over the medium
term and keep external vulnerabilities in check. Last year’s public pension reform marks an initial yet
important step towards raising domestic savings.11
34.
The real exchange rate is moderately overvalued, hindering competitiveness, but the
authorities saw room for a larger current account deficit if it was driven by higher investment.
11

The public pension reform reduced about ½ percentage point of GDP from the about 7 percentage point of GDP
long-term deterioration in the deficit of the social security system that was projected before the reform (IMF Country
Report No. 12/191).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

31

BRAZIL

The authorities concurred that the real overvaluation had been a factor behind the weak investment
and the deteriorating external position. However, they were rather sanguine about the estimated
gap between the existing current account deficit and the norm indicated by the EBA, because they
saw it as reflecting higher investment largely financed by FDI. Staff stressed that a range of
indicators pointed to a significant deterioration in competitiveness, notably the large and sustained
rise in unit labor costs, and that broad and sustained reform efforts were necessary to restore it. In
addition to alleviating pressing infrastructure bottlenecks, these efforts would have to include
mobilizing domestic savings (public and private) and reviewing the minimum wage adjustment
mechanism to keep unit labor costs in check and improve the investment climate.
35.
The authorities considered that recent tax cuts and reduced energy prices were key to
improve business conditions and the investment climate, but staff underscored the
importance of broad reforms. There was a consensus that burdensome taxes and high costs,
including energy, have increasingly weighed on investment. The authorities pointed out that recent
payroll tax cuts and the lowering of energy tariffs should boost corporate profitability and
strengthen incentives to invest. Staff suggested that more fundamental and far-reaching tax reform
aiming at simplifying the tax system, lowering tax rates, and reducing the costs of compliance,
notably the ICMS (Imposto de Circulação de Mercadorias e Serviços) should remain a policy priority.

STAFF APPRAISAL
36.
During the last decade, Brazil’s strong macroeconomic frameworks have contributed
to preserve macroeconomic stability, support robust growth, and underpin sustained poverty
reduction. The key pillars of Brazil’s macroeconomic frameworks have been the fiscal responsibility
law, the inflation targeting regime, and the flexible exchange rate. In addition, a strong prudential
framework has underpinned a sound financial sector that withstood well the global financial crisis of
2008–09. The prolonged macroeconomic stability has facilitated the adoption of far-reaching social
programs that have produced a remarkable social transformation—in particular, a substantial
reduction in poverty and the increase in living standards of large segments of the population.
37.
Brazil’s sharp growth slowdown since mid-2011 has reflected binding supply
constraints and heightened uncertainty about macroeconomic policies, including excessive
fine tuning and stimulus. In staff’s view, this situation calls for a tightening of the policy stance to
rebalance demand away from consumption and to restore confidence on the long-standing
macroeconomic frameworks. In particular, a steady process of fiscal consolidation, anchored on
Brazil’s long-standing target for a fiscal primary surplus of 3.1 percent of GDP, would support
monetary policy and bolster the recovery in confidence and investment. In addition, a front-loaded
monetary tightening will help lower inflation expectations and inertia and limit potential sacrifice
effects in terms of activity. More generally, going forward, authorities should assign to monetary
policy the main role in aggregate demand management, and focus fiscal policy on rebuilding
buffers.

32

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BRAZIL

x
The start of decisive monetary tightening is welcome. The pivotal beginning of the tightening
cycle by the central bank is a critical step to contain inflationary pressures. A front-loaded tightening
and clear indication of the priority assigned to meeting the target over the relevant horizon will help
anchor medium-term inflation expectations, forestall indexation, and contain inflation inertia.
x
The authorities should place higher priority on fiscal consolidation. A steady decline in the
gross debt to GDP ratio will lessen the burden on monetary policy, rebuild fiscal buffers, and
enhance confidence in the fiscal framework. The authorities’ intention of limiting the use of
adjustors to the primary surplus target as well as reducing policy lending in 2013 is welcomed but
should not be made contingent on a rapid pace of recovery.
x
The reliance on public banks for demand management and other quasi-fiscal operations
should be winded down. Fiscal policy is more effective when done transparently through the budget
and records all actual or potential costs. The envisaged phasing out of policy lending by the
authorities is welcome, but the plans to maintain this lending for several more years would continue
to increase fiscal risks. The demand management role that has been given to public banks in recent
years has resulted in a rapid expansion of their balance sheets and increased gross public debt,
creating a potential fiscal burden. A bolder plan to reduce their government-sponsored lending over
the coming years would be advisable.
38.
Strengthening Brazil’s fiscal framework would require efforts on several fronts,
including:
x
Adhering to a primary surplus target of about 3 percent of GDP that places gross public debt
firmly on a downward path. The primary surplus target of 3.1 percent of GDP, as established in the
Budget Guidance Law (without the use of adjustors in normal circumstances or extraordinary
operations, and maintaining cross-compensation between the federal government and sub-national
governments), would ensure that gross public debt is put firmly back on a downward path.
x
Maintaining fiscal discipline of sub-national governments. The contribution of subnational
governments to the consolidated primary surplus target has declined in recent years, as the rise in
current spending has outpaced revenue growth. The long-standing mechanisms to protect fiscal
discipline at the subnational level should be preserved.
x
Easing budget rigidities to increase public saving. Relaxing the budget rigidities that
contribute to the high level of public consumption is critical to increase public saving. Modifying the
minimum wage indexation mechanism to help contain costs associated with minimum pensions
would be a key step.
x
Recognizing contingent fiscal risks. Contingent risks related to public sector involvement in
infrastructure investment and public banks should be more fully quantified and reported in the
Fiscal Risks Annex to the annual Budget Guidance Law. Liabilities may arise from a possible
deterioration of assets held by public banks, as well as from potential commitments contracted
under concession agreements for infrastructure projects.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

39.
Ongoing efforts to strengthen financial regulation and supervision are welcome but
continued vigilance of potential risks is warranted. Brazil’s financial supervision and banking
system remain sound, and the banking system is well placed to implement Basel III. Efforts to
strengthen the resolution framework as well as progress in implementing the recommendations
from the recent FSAP Update are welcome, but it is important to advance in the full set of the
recommendations. Although non-performing loans have declined, risks arising from the past rapid
build-up of household credit, in a context of very low unemployment, warrant ongoing vigilance,
especially as the likely increase in interest rates may offset some of the recent improvements in debt
service capacity. A correction in property prices, although not systemic, could worsen asset quality in
public banks due to the rapid expansion of mortgage loans in recent years. Corporate issuance has
helped improve balance sheets, but increased leverage in some sectors should be monitored
carefully.
40.
The flexible exchange rate should remain the main shock absorber in periods of
financial turbulence, and intervention should continue to aim at avoiding excessive volatility.
If global monetary conditions were to tighten unexpectedly and lead to a sudden increase in global
risk aversion, the exchange rate should be allowed to depreciate and intervention should be geared
at avoiding disorderly market dynamics. On the other hand, if large capital inflow pressures were to
re-emerge, the exchange rate should be allowed to appreciate somewhat but be supported by other
policies, including some further temporary reserve accumulation and CFMs. Recent increases in
tariffs, while consistent with WTO obligations, risk undermining G-20 commitments to avoid trade
protectionism.
41.
The authorities’ renewed focus on easing supply-side constraints is welcome, but more
decisive and comprehensive efforts are needed to enhance productivity and competitiveness
and increase potential growth. Staff agrees that market-based concessions for infrastructure
projects (which should adequately transfer risks to the private sector) are likely to increase private
investment and bolster business confidence. Increasing the investment to GDP ratio and boosting
productivity will be critical to achieve a sustained potential growth rate above the historical average
of 3 percent. The increase in investment will have to rely importantly on domestic saving to avoid a
buildup of external vulnerabilities. To that end, further pension reform efforts—following last year’s
important reform of the public pension system—would be an important step.12 Revising the
minimum wage indexation mechanism, together with the efforts to rebalance demand away from
consumption, are essential to keep unit labor costs in check and prevent further erosion in
competitiveness; this would contribute to bolster the return on capital (particularly in
manufacturing) and improve incentives for investment.13 Other policies should complement these

See IMF Country Report No. 12/191, Selected Issues Paper Chapter I. Staff analysis suggests that such reforms
could increase national saving over the medium term.

1/ Non-financial sector gross public debt consolidates debt of public enterprises with that of general government. Unlike the authorities' definition,
gross general government debt comprises treasury bills at the central bank's balance sheet not used under repurchase agreements.
2/ Derived as [(r - (1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g++g)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate;  = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; a = share of
foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r -  (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Annex I. Brazil’s External Sector Assessment
Brazil’s external position appears moderately weaker than implied by medium-term
fundamentals and desirable policy settings. Further efforts to increase savings would be
needed, including by advancing with pension reform and shifting the structure of public
spending away from consumption towards investment. It will be important to maintain a
macro policy stance and a policy mix that moderates demand and facilitates rebalancing,
along with use of capital flow management measures to manage volatile capital flows.

Current Account
1.

Brazil’s current account has turned into deficit over the last decade, despite large

terms of trade gains. Import volumes doubled since 2004, supported by strong domestic demand,
while export volumes have remained broadly flat. Booming commodity prices have sustained
primary exports and helped contain the current account deficit, but the share of manufactured
exports has declined. As an illustration of the impact of commodity prices on the trade balance,
were the terms of trade to return to their 2005 level, Brazil’s current account deficit would have
reached 4 percent of GDP in 2012 (compared with the actual 2.4 percent of GDP). In 2013, the
current account deficit has widened further to a cumulative 3 percent of GDP in April 2013.1

preventing further deterioration in external balances over the medium term and support an increase
in investment—also relatively low compared to other emerging economies. Policies that could help
bolster savings include further steps to reform the pension system and containing the rate of growth
of public consumption.
3.

The current account deficit is expected to widen further over the medium term to

about 3¾ percent of GDP, under unchanged policies and at the current level of the real
exchange rate. This outlook is based on buoyant growth in imports and some gradual worsening in
the terms of trade over the medium term. The ongoing development of Brazil’s off-shore (“pre-sal”)
oil potential, however, introduces considerable uncertainty to these projections.2 Based on the staff’s
current estimates, the oil balance—oil exports net of direct oil imports and imports of capital goods
2

This is related to uncertainty over the potential size of Brazil’s oil reserves, the timing for the start of production in
new fields, the required investment levels, and potential near-term capacity constraints.

related to the oil sector—is expected to improve by half of one percentage point of GDP from 2012
to 2018. Over the next decade, net oil exports are projected to increase to more than 3 million
barrels per day, which would help contain the increase in the current account deficit. These
developments, if not offset by higher imports, would help reduce the estimated current account and
exchange rate gaps in the long run.

Exchange rate and relative prices
4.

Despite a recent depreciation, the real exchange rate remains around pre-crisis levels.

The real effective exchange rate (REER) rose substantially since the early 2000s through mid-2011,
but since then it has depreciated, partly reversing the significant appreciation. Since end-2012, the
REER depreciated by about 4 percent. However, the REER remains about 15 percent above its longterm average levels. Most of the movement in the REER was due to changes in the nominal effective
exchange rate, although in recent years the contribution of inflation differentials has increased.
5.

The appreciation has also partly contributed to Brazil’s rising unit labor costs. Brazil’s

terms of trade have increased about 30 percent since 2004, contributing to the appreciation,
although there has been some reversal since late 2011, reflecting the decline in some commodity
prices. Unit labor costs have grown much faster (by about 150 percent for the same period) on the
back of high nominal wage increases and tighter labor market conditions.

Model based current account and exchange rate valuations
6.

Model based estimates suggest that the current account deficit is somewhat larger than its

medium-term norm and that the real exchange rate is on the strong side. The staff’s analysis
suggests that a structural current account deficit of about 1–2 percent of GDP over the medium
term and a real exchange rate depreciation of about 10–15 percent would be consistent with

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

59

BRAZIL

fundamentals and desirable policy settings. These assessments are within the range of model-based
estimates:
x

The IMF’s External Balance Approach and the traditional CGER approach suggest norms for the
medium term current account deficit in Brazil in the range of 0.8–2.5 percent of GDP. These
estimates could understate the norm given upside uncertainty on oil production and export
prospects.

x

The estimates for real exchange rate misalignment are similar across the EBA RER and CGER
approaches, indicating an overvaluation of about 9–20 percent relative to current and medium
term fundamentals.

Capital account flows, international reserves and international
investment position
7.

Following the global crisis, Brazil attracted sizable capital inflows that helped to

finance the current account deficit and contributed to currency appreciation (Panel). In the
crisis’ aftermath Brazil experienced large capital inflows amid robust economic growth and high
interest rate differentials. Foreign capital inflows reached 5¼ and 7½ percent of GDP in 2009 and
2010, respectively, with portfolio flows contributing about half of total inflows. Since mid-2011,
however, capital inflows moderated to about 4½ percent of GDP in 2012, with the share of portfolio
flows declining to about 15 percent. A number of global and domestic reasons contributed to the
moderation, including global uncertainty, tightening of capital flow measures (CFMs), a substantial
slowdown in growth and reduction in interest rate differentials (driven by the cumulative cut in
policy rate of 525 bps).
8.

Brazil has deployed a wide range of policy tools to manage capital flow pressures,

including exchange rate appreciation, reserves accumulation, and the use of macroprudential
tools and priced-based CFMs. Since 2009, CFMs—in particular the tax on inflows (Imposto de
Operações Financeiras, IOF)—have been applied to moderate flows and influence their composition,
adjusting the rate and coverage to account for changes in the composition of capital flows
(including imposing the tax on derivatives transactions). The implementation of the framework has
responded to the intensity of pressures, reducing FX intervention and CFMs when inflow pressures
subsided.3 The broad use of the policy toolkit has helped to manage the challenges posed by capital
inflows. There is some evidence that CFMs have been successful in helping to reduce portfolio
inflows although the evidence on a persistent effect on the exchange rate is unclear.
9.

Central bank intervention has focused on reducing the volatility of the exchange rate.4

With the moderation of capital inflows, the pace of accumulation of international reserves stopped
in 2012. International reserves have stabilized at around US$380 billion, and are considered more
than adequate with respect to various metrics, including the IMF’s composite adequacy measure. As
such, Brazil is well placed to withstand potential external risks. Further temporary reserve
accumulation may take place in the context of managing capital flows.

3

The IOF on fixed income instruments and net currency derivative positions was reduced to zero in June 2013.

4

In June 2013, the central bank conducted a number of currency swap auctions for a total amount of about
$20 billion.

10.

Brazil’s net foreign asset (NFA) position and its composition have improved in recent

years. The NFA position has strengthened from -45 percent of GDP in 2003 to -30 percent in 2012.
FDI liabilities account for about half of total liabilities. Brazil’s NFA position and external debt levels
are relatively low compared with other emerging market economies. However, with the envisaged
widening of the current account deficit (at a constant real exchange rate), the NFA position would
worsen over the medium term. In the longer run, as Brazil’s large “pre-sal” oil reserves come on line,
added efforts to increase savings and therefore strengthen the country’s external NFA position
would be appropriate.

Annex II. Why is Brazil’s Labor Market Tight?1
1.

Brazil’s labor market continued to tighten in 2011-12 even as economic growth

slowed, which contributed to rapid real wage growth and robust household spending. The
unemployment rate has trended lower for the last decade and has exhibited minimal cyclicality,
notwithstanding considerable variation in the economic cycle. In particular, the lack of sensitivity of
the unemployment rate to growth during 2011–12 has been remarkable. Job creation has
moderated from high levels but remains positive and real earnings have risen at a steady and rapid
pace, reflecting a buoyant labor market but also large increases in the minimum wage. Tight labor
market conditions have underpinned consumption and supported the ongoing expansion in
household credit, intensifying demand and cost-push pressures on inflation. At the same time, the
tight labor market has contributed to the large increase in unit labor costs, reducing
competitiveness and hindering incentives for investment (particularly in manufacturing).

3.

What explains such a tight labor market during a period of subdued growth? A number

of structural and cyclical factors are often put forward to explain this apparent puzzle, which are
explored below: moderating labor force growth; the sectoral composition of growth; labor hoarding
reflecting skills shortages and frictional costs; and fiscal measures aimed at supporting employment.
4.

Labor force growth has moderated during 2011–12 due to slowing growth in the

working-age population. The labor force has varied with the cycle over the last decade but a
slowing trend has emerged in recent years, leaving its growth below that for employment since
2010. This mainly reflects structural demographic factors as the rate of expansion of the workingage population since 2007 has declined substantially. At the same time, the participation rate has
remained broadly stable with falling participation rates for the 15–24 age group—reflecting more
years spent in education—largely offset by an increase in the participation rate of the workers over
25 years old.

The balance of growth, notably a strong service sector offsetting a weak industrial

sector, has contributed to net job creation. The labor-intensive service sector expanded by a
cumulative 4 percent during 2011–12 compared to near stagnation in industry and an outright
decline in manufacturing. Over the same period, the broadly defined service sector accounted for
80 percent of the net new jobs created, more than offsetting weak job creation in the industrial
sector. Service sector expansions typically have a large impact on the labor market, with staff
estimates showing that the response of net new job creation to a one percentage-point increase in

Fiscal measures, particularly cuts in payroll taxes paid by employers, may have also

supported labor demand. Most literature on Brazil’s labor market finds that payroll tax cuts tend to
reduce unemployment.4 The burden of the social security tax paid by employers has been reduced
3

According to the World Bank Doing Business Survey, dismissal costs in Brazil have been low and broadly
unchanged compared to other LA5 countries. However, Brazilian companies have been constrained by the hiring
process where fixed contracts are prohibited for activities involving permanent tasks, particularly during the last two
years when manufacturing GDP growth has declined substantially.
4

For instance, Bosh and Esteban-Pretel (2009) found that payroll tax cuts, by boosting labor demand, tend to
increase formal employment and reduce unemployment rate (a non-neutral effect).

these payroll measures have been broadened over time and now encompass a wide range of
sectors, including some services.5

Annex III. Public Banks’ Rapid Expansion1
1.

Public banks have increased their lending operations very rapidly since the global

financial crisis. They have carried out a social lending mandate to expand access to finance and
support development: Caixa focuses on housing loans; Banco do Brasil supplies a large amount of
rural credit; and BNDES provides financing for long-term investments in economic development
programs.2 They have also played a demand management role by offsetting private banks’ slower
credit supply to sustain overall credit growth. In 2011 and 2012, lending by public banks grew over
25 percent per annum on average, compared to about 10 percent of private banks, increasing their
share of total credit to 48 percent. Notably, Caixa expanded its credit portfolio by over 40 percent in
this period.

BNDES has recently enhanced its market development role: the holding company of BNDES (BNDESPar) has issued
corporate bonds under the “New Fixed Income Market” program, which the private capital markets association
(Anbima) launches to facilitate long-term financing operations. This program aims to support secondary market
liquidity, including through standardization of issuances, a liquidity improvement fund, and a liquidity guarantee
fund. See Park (2012) for detailed information. BNDES also signed an agreement to foster a market for environmental
assets together with the state of Rio de Janeiro and Acre in March 2013.

2.

The substantial credit expansion in recent years by public banks has been financed

significantly with transfers from the Treasury. Before 2008, public banks’ funding mainly relied
on the earmarked allocation from savings account (SBPE), workers’ severance fund (FGTS), and
workers’ protection fund (FAT). Since the global financial crisis, the Treasury has provided subsidized
direct lending to public banks, mostly to BNDES. In 2012, the Treasury lent 1 percent of GDP to
BNDES and 0.5 percent to Caixa and Banco do Brasil. As a result of these operations, by end-2012,
total net obligations from public banks to the Treasury stood at 9.2 percent of GDP, of which
8.4 percent were with BNDES. The fiscal cost of government lending has also increased as the longterm interest rate (TJLP)–the rate public banks pay on obligations to the Treasury—was reduced by
100 bps to 5 percent during 2012, with the lower rate applying to all outstanding loans.
3.

Public banks continued to focus on specific credit segments entailing low risk, but

recently Caixa increased its exposure to other types of credit. Banco do Brasil continued to
expand both payroll-deducted loans and rural credit. BNDES intensified portfolio concentration by
increasing its share of loans to 10 largest customers from 38.7 to 40.9 percent, such as Petrobras,
Vale, and Eletrobras. While Caixa kept playing a key role in the housing market and the payrolldeducted loan market, it raised somewhat the share of overdraft, credit card, and non-payroll
personal loans in its portfolio in 2012.3

Rapid credit growth by public banks, particularly Caixa, warrants close monitoring.

Public banks’ credit portfolios have traditionally been less risky than those of private banks, thanks
to subsidized lending rates, prudent loan-to-value ratios for mortgage loans and government
guaranteed low-income housing loans (Caixa), and lending to low credit risk borrowers (BNDES).
Currently, public banks have low default rates (2 percent), and are capitalized above regulatory
requirements (11 percent). However, the rapid credit expansion in recent years represents a risk that
warrant close monitoring. Public banks’ return on assets dropped sharply in 2012, with reduced
profit margins from lower lending rates, and their capital adequacy ratio (CAR) has continued to
decline. Caixa’s capitalization is close to minimum regulatory requirement, and its NPL ratios by
vintage show recently a marginal uptick.

Safeguards Assessments: A safeguards assessment of the Banco Central do Brasil (BCB) was
completed in June 2002 and updated in March 2005.
Exchange Rate Arrangement: Since January 18, 1999, Brazil’s de facto and de jure foreign
exchange regime has been classified as floating. Brazil continued to avail itself of the transitional
arrangements of Article XIV, Section 2, of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement through November 1999,
while no longer maintaining restrictions under this Article. In a letter dated November 11, 1999, the
Brazilian authorities informed the Fund that they accepted the obligations of Article VIII,
Sections 2(a), 3, and 4, effective November 30, 1999.
Foreign exchange regulations have been liberalized further in recent years. In March 2005, the
foreign exchange markets were unified; the requirement that residents transferring foreign
exchange abroad do so through CC5 accounts (nonresident financial institutions accounts) was
eliminated and export surrender requirements were simplified; limits and restrictions for the
purchase and sale of foreign exchange and for international transfers in reais were eliminated for
most transactions, except for: (a) investments in the capital and derivatives markets; and
(b) investments abroad made by institutions authorized to operate by the central bank and for all
funds subject to specific regulations. At present, central bank prior approval is no longer required
for virtually all transactions.
In August 2006, remaining foreign currency controls at the central bank on export proceeds and
import payments were abolished. The surrender of foreign exchange for exports was increased to
the last working day of the corresponding month in the year following the date of shipment (and
360 days before shipment), and exporters were allowed to permanently keep up to 30 percent of
their export proceeds abroad. Other measures introduced in August 2006 included: (a) the
elimination of fines for delays or lack of execution of foreign exchange contracts for operations up
to US$3,000; (b) the possibility of registering in domestic currency (at the central bank) all foreign
capital held by corporations in Brazil and not yet registered or subject to other forms of registration;
and (c) the possibility of making payments in reais for duty-free store purchases.
In September 2006, restrictions for investments in the capital and derivatives markets were
eliminated. In April 2007, regulations on investments abroad by investment funds were liberalized
further, subject to prudential rules set by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Brazil. In
March 2008, exporters were allowed to keep 100 percent of their export proceeds abroad, up from
the 30 percent limit established in August 2006. In May 2008, banks were authorized to hold

accounts offshore in reais. In July 2008 changes were made (a) allowing firms not registered to act in
foreign exchange markets to make transactions of up to US$3,000 without prior authorization;
(b) permitting settlement in reais of foreign exchange transactions between authorized Brazilian
banks and foreign banks; and (c) raising to US$50,000 the limit on financial and trade transactions
not subject to registration requirements for nonbank financial institutions. In November 2008
authorized banks were permitted to use accounts in entities domiciled offshore to settle realdenominated obligations with nonresident accounts.
Last Article IV Consultation
The last Article IV consultation with Brazil was concluded by the Executive Board on July 9, 2012.
Brazil is on the 12-month cycle. Joint Fund/World Bank missions visited Brazil in 2002 for the
Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP), which was discussed by the Board in December 2002.
A FSAP Update mission took place in March 2012.
Technical Assistance
Fiscal Affairs Department (FAD). In September 2001, an FAD mission conducted a fiscal ROSC, and
in December 2001 a mission provided Technical Assistance (TA) on tax reform. Subsequent missions
have discussed the scope for increasing investment in infrastructure within a framework of
continued fiscal responsibility, including during a follow-up visit in November 2004. In July 2008, a
ROSC on fiscal transparency was undertaken for the state of São Paulo, which also received a
seminar on performance budgeting in November 2008. In December 2009 a mission visited São
Paulo to examine the state’s medium-term expenditure framework with the purpose of improving
fiscal performance and the quality of public expenditure. In November 2010, a short-term expert
visited São Paulo to provide advice on cost accounting and a long-term advisor was installed in
February 2011 to support efforts in this area. In April a follow-up mission evaluated progress in
implementing the program budgeting and cost accounting systems. In May 2011, a short-term
expert followed-up on the implementation of the program budgeting reforms. Between July 2011
and May 2012, FAD conducted several missions on public financial management, focusing on the
review of the cost accounting systems and on improvements to the budgeting system.
Statistics Department (STA). Several missions have visited Brazil during 1998–2011 to provide TA
on monetary and financial statistics, quarterly national income accounts, and government finance.
These missions also assisted the authorities in the subscription to the SDDS, improving the analytical
quality of Brazil’s monetary aggregates, and the implementation of GFSM 2001. Recent missions
have assisted the Ministry of Finance, the Banco Central do Brasil and the Instituto Brasileiro de
Geografia e Estatística with the compilation of government finance statistics, price indices and the
new national accounts framework, with greater emphasis on the consistency across macroeconomic
statistics.
Monetary and Capital Markets Department (MCM). Missions visited Brazil in 2000 to assess
observance of the Code of Good Practices on Transparency in Monetary and Financial Policies and
compliance with the Basel Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision. In August and

December 2009, missions visited to assist the capital markets regulator (CVM) in considering mutual
funds development and regulation, and issues surrounding securitization and valuation of financial
securities. A mission visited in August 2009 to work on credit risk modeling for financial oversight. In
March 2010 a mission visited the National Treasury to initiate a technical cooperation project on
term-structure modeling and debt management. A follow up mission to present preliminary results
took place in January 2011. The project was completed in May 2011 with the publication of an IMF
working paper (No. 11/113), “On Brazil’s Term Structure: Stylized Facts and Analysis of
Macroeconomic Interactions”.
Resident Representative
The Fund maintains a resident representative office in Brasilia. The Resident Representative is
Mr. Carlos Fernandez Valdovinos, who assumed the post in July 2011.

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK1
On November 1, 2011, the World Bank approved its new Country Partnership Strategy (CPS)
for Brazil, which will guide the Group’s overall program in the country for FY 2012–2015. The
new CPS builds on, and deepens, the last FY 20082011 Country Strategy. The World Bank Group
has been a valued partner for Brazil, providing integrated and often multi-sector development
solutions tailored to its needs. The GoB’s demand for a continued strong partnership with the WBG
is evidenced by the pre-payment of IBRD loans, in an approximate amount of $6.7 billion between
2009 and 2011, so as to open space for sub-national lending within IBRD’s Single Borrower Limit.2
The Bank has also benefited greatly from Brazil’s unique demands, which required the WBG to adapt
and learn. Innovation and knowledge have been the central elements of this relationship, with
strong flows of knowledge transfers to, from, and within Brazil, supported by a large impact
evaluation program. The FY 12–15 CPS seeks to take these achievements further by maintaining the
focus on knowledge generation and transfer, with greater emphasis on inclusiveness in line with
President Rousseff’s goal of eradicating extreme poverty. In this context, the Bank and IFC will
expand their support for the Northeast, Brazil’s poorest region, and for sustainable development in
the Amazon, the Cerrado, and other fragile ecosystems.
Brazil’s priorities for its partnership with the WBG are focused on second-generation
development problems that require innovative solutions. These involve improvements in
national policy frameworks and new ways to implement programs with sub-national governments
and at the firm level. The WBG will help address these challenges, and help achieve the overarching
goal of higher rates of inclusive and sustainable growth by focusing on four strategic objectives:
(i) increase the efficiency of public and private investments; (ii) improve the quality and expand the
provision of public services for low income households; (iii) promote regional economic
development through improved policies, strategic infrastructure investments, and support for the
private sector in frontier areas; and (iv) further improve sustainable natural resource management
and enhance climatic resilience while contributing to local economic development and helping to
meet rising global food demand. Brazil is looking to the Bank as a partner in the dissemination of
the country knowledge and development experiences to other countries.
At the Federal level, Brazil’s demand is concentrated in knowledge and strategy development
services. These require a combination of AAA and knowledge-intensive lending, but also leaving
room for other financial solutions as needed. The Federal Government is also interested in the
Bank’s support to sub-national Governments as a way of enhancing the implementation of national
policies, ranging from the fiscal responsibility framework to strategic social and infrastructure

Current calculations suggest that maximum IBRD lending space under the US$16.5 billion Single Borrower Limit is
US$2.0 billion for FY 14 and US$1.5 billion in FY 15, or a combination thereof. The Bank is currently working with the
Government to explore options on how to continue the engagement despite such restrictions.

investment programs. Sub-national governments demand integrated multi-sector development
solutions, combining technical and financial support and using tailored instruments. The private
sector seeks highly customized financing packages to help meet unique business and growth
objectives.
The CPS identifies an indicative IBRD lending program in the order of US$1.8 billion for FY 14.
While this is in line with annual lending in FY 08–11, it is equivalent to about 0.3% of total public
expenditures. IFC's own-account investment program is forecast at about US$1.5 billion annually in
FY 13–14, a minute fraction of total private sector investment. Thus, if the WBG is to have a
significant impact in Brazil, this cannot be derived exclusively from the size of its financial
contributions, which are bound to be small with respect to the country’s own resources. Rather, the
WBG will seek to have a development impact in Brazil through the knowledge contributions that it
will embed in its various activities. In particular, the Bank Group will deploy its resources according
to the following principles. Flexibility: Adjusting areas of engagement and instruments to better
respond to the country’s evolving needs. Selectivity: Focusing on areas where Brazil faces secondgeneration development challenges and can benefit most from the Group’s knowledge and
experience. Innovation: Supporting innovative investments and policy reforms that can be replicated
locally and internationally, and offering innovative services and instruments (e.g. result-based and
multi-sector loans, partial credit risk and other guarantees). Leveraging: Increasing the use of
leveraged resources from government, the private sector and other development partners, to
maximize development impacts.
IFC will continue responding to the needs of a rapidly-evolving private sector with a suite of
competitive financial and advisory products. In FY 11, Brazil had IFC’s largest single country new
business and mobilization program in the world. While IFC does not expect to increase business
volumes significantly, the nature of its involvement is changing toward (i) a greater focus on smaller,
more difficult investments in poorer, frontier regions such as the Northeast and North;
(ii) supporting innovation and competitiveness, promoting South-South knowledge transfers and
encouraging access to new markets and products, and (iii) increasing IFC's advisory support to subnational Governments for PPPs in infrastructure, social sectors, and the environment. IFC sharply
expanded its activities in Brazil during the previous CPS period. As of March 31, 2013, IFC
commitments in Brazil stand at $2.46 billion.
MIGA has a long history of promoting investment into Brazil with a strong focus on the
power sector, aimed at alleviating the imbalance of electricity supply and demand caused by
the geographic distance and climate difference across regions. Other projects spanned
manufacturing, financial, transportation, telecommunications and oil and gas sectors. The team is
currently working on a transport project in the state of São Paulo. The project consists of:
(i) $729 million in investments by the State of São Paulo, Brazil (SoSP), toward sustainable
transportation; (ii) a $300 million from an IBRD loan; (iii) $300 million from private banks; (iv) an
NHSFO guarantee from MIGA; and (v) a $129 million equity investment from SoSP’s own funds.
MIGA will go to Board once prospective lenders are identified by SoSP. MIGA has also seen
increasing demand for political risk insurance from Brazilian investors going into emerging markets

and has issued guarantees to three projects in Latin America thus far. Among the projects by
Brazilian investors currently in the pipeline, Tumarin Hydroelectric Power project is likely to close in
FY 14. The 253 MW hydroelectric dam is a $1.1 billion project that will supply nearly 25% of all
Nicaragua’s energy needs once it is completed in 2016, according to plans. The dam will be built in
La Cruz de Río Grande, a rural and bucolic farming community of some 3,000 people in the South
Atlantic Autonomous Region.

RELATIONS WITH THE INTER-AMERICAN
DEVELOPMENT BANK3
The IDB’s New Country Strategy with Brazil was approved on May 9, 2012. This was established
for the period 20122014 and is comprised of six strategic objectives: (1) stimulate social and
productive inclusion; (2) improve the condition of the country’s infrastructure (3) promote the
development of sustainable cities; (4) improve the institutional capacity of public entities;
(5) increase the sustainable management of natural resources and climate change mitigation and
adaptation actions; and (6) promote development through the private sector.
For 2013, total loan approvals are estimated to reach US$3,546 million, including
US$1,530 million in Policy-Based Loans to four States (Amazonas, Alagoas, Pernambuco and
Rio Grande do Sul). In addition, the IDB program in the period estimates approvals of
US$42.5 million in grants for Technical Cooperation.
In 2012, the IDB approved 23 loans amounting to US$2,009 million. Most of the lending went
to support institutional strengthening and modernization of the state (43%) and productivity and
infrastructure (34 %). Lending to subnational governments corresponded to 66% of total lending to
Brazil, and included two Policy-Based Loans (Rio Grande do Sul and Bahia) for US$800 million.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of June 28, 2013)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: The quality of macroeconomic statistics has improved significantly, and data provision is

adequate for surveillance.
National Accounts: The national accounts estimates are compiled based on the guidelines of the

1993 System of National Accounts. The availability of annual and quarterly supply and use tables also
contribute to the development of consistent national accounts estimates. The series (data and
supporting methodological notes) are available on the internet (http://www.ibge.gov.br) and in
International Financial Statistics (IFS).
Price Statistics: Since July 1999, the official consumer price index has been the Broad Consumer Price

Index (IPCA) compiled by the Brazilian Statistical Institute (IBGE). The IPCA covers changes in the
prices of goods and services purchased by households earning between one and forty times the
minimum wage in 11 metropolitan areas. Wholesale price indices are compiled only by the Getúlio
Vargas Foundation (FGV). The export price data include total unit values of exports, and unit values
and wholesale prices of coffee exports. The IBGE compiles a monthly producer price index of
manufacturing activity with a December 2009 base.
Government Finance Statistics: The Ministry of Finance and the Brazilian Central Bank (BCB) compile

and disseminate government finance statistics using the Government Finance Statistics Manual
(GFSM) 2001 presentation. The reported statistics include the statement of government operations
and financial balance sheet for the consolidated central government (comprising the National
Treasury and Social Security) as well as financing operations and the financial balance sheet for the
general government. The reported data are compiled by converting the nationally published data,
which still broadly follow the GFSM 1986 framework. The data reflect the movements of the single
treasury account and are on a cash basis except for interest. The gross debt indicator excludes
government securities under the central bank’s outright ownership, making international
comparisons difficult.
In 2009, the Brazilian authorities developed a migration plan for the full implementation the GFSM
2001. This plan comprises the introduction of a new accounting framework based on the
International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS), which merges the traditional budgetary
approach, the accrual based accounting, and some additional internal controls into a single system.
This new accounting framework significantly enhances the usefulness of the Brazilian public sector
accounting information, which will be a significant step towards the compilation of complete GFS in
a systematic way, and is expected to be in place in 2015.

BRAZIL

I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance (continued)
Monetary and Financial Statistics: The BCB compiles and publishes monetary and financial statistics,

with concepts, definitions, and classification that are broadly in line with the Monetary and Financial
Statistics Manual (MFSM) 2000. In close cooperation with STA, the BCB introduced the standardized
report forms based on accounting data in March 2013. However, the institutional coverage of the
other financial corporations needs to be expanded to include insurance corporations, open pension
funds, capitalization funds, and exchange houses.
The BCB regularly reports quarterly FSIs to the IMF for publication. Currently, the BCB reports all
core and 17 encouraged FSIs, with data beginning in Q1 2005. Plans are under way to compile the
rest of the encouraged FSIs.
External Sector Statistics: Brazil disseminates quarterly data on the balance of payments and

international investment position. External data are compiled according to the fifth edition of the
Balance of Payments Manual. The BCB is supplementing the registry of the foreign exchange system
with surveys on transportation, insurance, and other services. Compilation of reinvested earnings
and undistributed branch profits item in the current account and reinvested earnings item in the
financial account could be improved, as the registry of the foreign exchange system does not
capture these transactions. Quarterly balance of payments data are reported. The BCB publishes the
data for monthly balance of payments and the Data Template on International Reserves and Foreign
Currency Liquidity with a lag of one month. Brazil reports quarterly total external debt position data
with a three-month lag to the World Bank’s Quarterly External Debt Statistics database.
II. Data Standards and Quality

Subscriber to the Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) since
2001. Uses SDDS flexibility options on the timeliness of the general
government operations and depository corporations survey.
Implementing G-20 DGI recommendations: The authorities have already

implemented a good number of the recommendations and work is underway
to implement the remaining ones. Further progress would focus on monetary
and financial statistics, external position and flow statistics, real estate price
indexes, general government statistics, and sectoral accounts.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on Brazil
Executive Board Meeting
July 26, 2013
1.
This note reports on information that has become available since the staff report was
issued and does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
The central bank of Brazil continued tightening monetary policy, raising the policy
rate by 50 bps to 8.50 percent in its July Monetary Policy meeting, in line with staff baseline
projections, for a cumulative 125 bps since April. In its communications it highlighted that
recent data point to a continued recovery in output, which would be supported by both
consumption and investment, but that there remain risks associated with business and
household confidence. Headline inflation as of end-June was 6.7 percent on a year-on-year
basis, above the ceiling of the inflation tolerance band (6.5 percent), but has started to
decelerate at the margin linked in part to lower food inflation.
3.
A wave of social demonstrations in early June appears to have subsided. A localized
protest against planned increases in bus fares in São Paulo gave way to several nationwide
protests. The grievances behind the protests were varied, ranging from discontent with the
poor quality of public services to slow progress in the fight against corruption, and appear to
have been directed at institutions and political parties broadly. The government has
announced several initiatives to address the grievances aired at the demonstrations, including:
strengthening fiscal controls at all levels of government to help reduce inflation; organizing a
plebiscite on a reform of the political system to eradicate corruption; stepping up investment
in hospitals; increasing investment in urban transportation and reducing some taxes on diesel;
and earmarking for education the royalties from some oil concessions. In addition, bus fare
increases were rolled back; the state of São Paulo cancelled the scheduled increase in toll
fares; and the import tariff for beans, an important food staple, was reduced to zero.
4.
The global re-pricing of assets that followed the change in expectations regarding the
pace of normalization of U.S. monetary policy affected Brazil’s financial markets in
May-June. Asset price volatility increased substantially but has subsided more recently. The
real has depreciated by about 5 percent in nominal terms against the US dollar since endMay (2 percent in nominal effective terms), more than other emerging markets, with
occasional central bank intervention through non-deliverable foreign currency swaps to limit
excess volatility. Local currency sovereign bond yields have increased by about 120 bps
during the same period, as a result of both global factors and the expected tightening of
monetary policy in Brazil. Equity prices have also underperformed other emerging markets,
linked in part to weaker growth prospects. Other financial indicators like CDS and EMBIG
spreads have moved broadly in line with emerging market peers. The authorities’ response
included further easing of capital flow management measures (CFMs) adopted in recent
years, including by eliminating the term for pre-payment of exports subject to the Financial

2
Transaction Tax (IOF), lowering to zero the rate for reserve requirements on short dollar
positions held by local banks, and reducing the capital requirements on bank exposure to
currency fluctuations.

Press Release No. 13/314
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
August 28, 2013

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with Brazil
On July 26, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Brazil.1
During the last decade, Brazil’s strong macroeconomic frameworks have contributed to
preserve macroeconomic stability, support robust growth, and underpin sustained poverty
reduction. The key pillars of Brazil’s macroeconomic frameworks have been the fiscal
responsibility law, the inflation targeting regime, and the flexible exchange rate. In addition,
a strong prudential framework has underpinned a sound financial sector that withstood well
the global financial crisis of 2008–09. The prolonged macroeconomic stability has facilitated
the adoption of far-reaching social programs that have produced a remarkable social
transformation—in particular, a substantial reduction in poverty and the increase in living
standards of large segments of the population.
Brazil’s economy is recovering gradually from the slowdown that began in mid-2011.
Consumption remained resilient last year underpinned by low unemployment and broad
gains in real wages, although it has slowed somewhat more recently. After a protracted
period of weakness, investment has begun to recover in recent quarters while business
confidence has firmed. With the economy estimated to be operating close to potential,
supply-side constraints have restrained near-term growth and exacerbated inflationary
pressures. Low unemployment has also contributed to demand-pull and cost-push inflation
pressures. End-of-period inflation, the reference measure for inflation-targeting in Brazil, has
been below the upper limit of the 4½ ± 2 percent target range for several years; it has been
running however in the upper range of the target band, while medium-term inflation
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the
Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary
is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found
here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2

expectations have risen above the mid-point target. The authorities have started to focus on
alleviating supply-side constraints (including infrastructure bottlenecks) and containing
inflationary pressures by tightening monetary policy.
The external current account deficit has widened, reflecting weaker external demand,
buoyant consumption and, more recently, a pickup in investment and temporary disruptions
in oil production. The real exchange rate depreciated over the last year, most recently as part
of a broader realignment across emerging markets. At the same time, unit labor costs in U.S.
dollars have remained broadly unchanged, limiting the impact on competitiveness, as the
effect of the weaker currency has been offset by rapid growth in real wages and stagnant
labor productivity gains. Capital inflows, particularly portfolio flows, subsided in 2012
linked to a weaker growth outlook and lower interest rates in Brazil, and the use of capital
flow measures. More recently, global financial volatility and higher global risk aversion have
further dampened portfolio inflows to Brazil. Equity prices have declined and corporate debt
and equity issuances have slowed, in line with other major emerging markets. Foreign direct
investment inflows, however, have remained robust. International reserves have remained
broadly stable at a high level following a halt in reserves accumulation since mid-2012.
Financial conditions have tightened but credit growth has remained strong, driven by public
banks’ lending. Mortgage lending has continued to grow strongly, but remains a relatively
small share of total credit. Real estate prices, though moderating, have continued to increase.
The authorities have made progress in implementing key recommendations of the 2012
Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) Update.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Brazilian authorities for their long-standing
commitment to sound policy frameworks, notably the fiscal responsibility law, inflation
targeting, the flexible exchange rate, and a strong prudential regime. They noted that these
frameworks, together with the implementation of social programs, have underpinned
macroeconomic stability and remarkable growth over the past decade, lifting living standards
and reducing poverty.
Directors observed that, in addition to headwinds from external conditions, domestic supplyside constraints and policy uncertainties may be holding back near-term growth. A tighter
policy stance would help address persistent price pressures, safeguard confidence in policy
frameworks, and set the stage for a medium-term rebalancing of demand away from
consumption. In this context, Directors welcomed the initiation of a monetary tightening
cycle, and agreed that monetary policy should remain geared at containing inflationary
pressures and anchoring inflation expectations. They underscored the need for a steady,
measured pace of fiscal consolidation, anchored on Brazil’s long-standing primary surplus
target. Some Directors saw a continued role for fiscal stimulus as a counter-cyclical tool.

3

More generally, Directors considered that monetary policy should play the main role in
aggregate demand management, with fiscal policy focused on rebuilding buffers.
Directors highlighted the importance of adhering to a primary surplus target that places
public debt firmly on a downward path. They encouraged efforts to maintain fiscal discipline
at the sub-national level, ease budget rigidities to increase public savings, and recognize
more fully potential fiscal risks associated with public bank assets and infrastructure
concession agreements. Directors also recommended a gradual reduction of policy lending to
public banks to improve debt dynamics. A number of Directors considered that a more
detailed assessment of Brazil’s public debt encompassing net and gross concepts would
permit an enhanced interpretation of fiscal developments and prospects.
Directors welcomed the substantial progress in strengthening financial regulation and
supervision. They observed that Brazil’s banking system is sound and well placed to
implement Basel III ahead of schedule. Directors noted nevertheless that some risks, notably
those associated with household credit and mortgage loans, warrant ongoing vigilance. They
welcomed the progress in implementing most of the recommendations of the recent Financial
Sector Assessment Program Update.
Directors concurred that the flexible exchange rate remains the main shock absorber in
periods of financial turbulence, and welcomed the authorities’ intention to limit interventions
in the foreign exchange market to moderating excessive volatility. They agreed that Brazil
has an adequate toolkit to deal with capital inflow pressures, by allowing the exchange rate to
appreciate somewhat, supported by other policies, including some further temporary reserve
accumulation and carefully-considered capital flow management measures.
Directors supported the focus of reforms to ease supply-side constraints, noting that the
government’s market-based concessions program would boost investment and alleviate
infrastructure bottlenecks. They emphasized that comprehensive efforts to boost productivity,
competitiveness, and investment are critical for raising potential growth. To this end, it will
be important to increase domestic saving, improve the minimum wage indexation
mechanism, and continue to reform the pension system. Other efforts to foster private
investment should include streamlining taxation and improving business conditions.

Economic activity
2.
Brazil’s rapidly growing economy underwent a marked slowdown in 2011 and
2012. This rather unexpected deceleration can be attributed to adverse external
circumstances and also to domestic factors, notably the restrictive policies adopted at the
end of 2010 and in the first half of 2011 and, perhaps more fundamentally, relatively low
investment rates and the exhaustion of a credit-based consumer durables cycle.
3.
Recovery from the slowdown has been more difficult than expected, despite a
series of measures taken by the government to foster growth. The Brazilian economy
started to pick up in the last quarter of 2012 and the latest results point to somewhat
stronger growth in the current year. In annual terms, seasonally adjusted, GDP grew 2.5
percent quarter-over-quarter in the last quarter of 2012 and 2.2 percent in the first quarter
of 2013. Industrial production has been recovering recently, increasing 1.7 percent in the
first five months of 2013 when compared with the same period of 2012.
4.
Job creation has continued, maintaining unemployment at historic lows and
helping hold up consumption, while inflation has remained within the target range. To
boost the country’s competitiveness and productive capacity, the authorities have
provided incentives for investment and production, including for private sector
engagement in key infrastructure projects. Long-due measures were taken to reduce
payroll taxes and the cost of electrical energy.
Fiscal policy
5.
Fiscal responsibility remains a cornerstone of Brazil’s economic policy. The
overall deficit of the consolidated public sector has exhibited a declining trend in the last
ten years, falling from 5.2 percent of GDP in 2003 to 2.5 percent in 2012.1 This is rather
low by international standards and reflects persistent primary surpluses as well as a
reduced burden of interest payments. The latter reflects in turn lower interest rates and a
declining debt-to-GDP ratio. The authorities and the IMF staff expect the overall deficit
to narrow slightly in 2013.
6.
The authorities’ commitment to a primary balance of 2.3 percent of GDP in 2013
was reaffirmed last Monday, when an additional reduction in current expenditure of 10

The consolidated public sector includes the federal government, the central bank, the social security
system, state and municipal governments, as well as state-owned enterprises (except Petrobras and
Eletrobras).

2
billion reais (0.2 percent of GDP) was announced for this year. Investment and priority
spending in areas such as health, education and social transfers were not affected.
7.
In recent years, fiscal policy has been employed in a countercyclical manner. If
we take, for example, IMF staff’s estimates of changes in the structural primary balance
(which adjusts for output gap and one-off measures) as the basis to assess the overall
stance of fiscal policy, we will conclude that policy was contractionary in 2011,
expansionary in 2012, and is projected to be roughly neutral in 2013 (see Table 3 of the
staff report). This is consistent with estimates published by the central bank. At the end of
2010 and in 2011 (mainly in the first half of the year), fiscal as well as monetary and
macro prudential policies were tightened in response to the perception that the economy
was overheating. As the international environment worsened during 2011, mainly due to
the euro area crisis, fiscal and other policies were reversed to stimulative mode.
8.
One can debate whether it is appropriate to add “policy lending” (to the national
development bank and other public financial institutions) to the structural primary
balance, as IMF staff does. If one does include estimates of “policy lending”, the overall
stance of fiscal policy, broadly defined, was projected to turn contractionary in 2013 even
before the measures announced last Monday (see Table 3). Thus, fiscal policy may be
becoming restrictive even though economic recovery is still in its early stages – a point
not highlighted by staff.
9.
The basic strength of fiscal policy becomes clearer when one considers the
evolution of some of the main components of the federal government’s accounts in recent
years. For instance, from 2002 to 2012, the wage bill dropped from 4.8 to 4.3 percent of
GDP and interest payments from 7.7 to 4.9 percent of GDP. The deficit in the social
security system fell from 1.7 percent of GDP in 2007 to 0.9 percent of GDP in 2012. For
these and other reasons, we are intrigued by the somewhat negative tone of staff’s
assessment of Brazilian fiscal policy and prospects.
Public debt
10.
Over the last decade, robust fiscal results as well as economic growth have put the
consolidated net public debt firmly on a downward path, from 60 percent of GDP in 2002
to 35 percent in 2012. In the same period, gross debt as defined in the staff report has also
declined relatively to GDP, but less sharply, from 80 to 68 percent (see Box 7 of the staff
report). The discrepancy between the reductions in net and gross debt is to a great extent
associated with the rapid accumulation of international reserves since 2006. As staff
notes, it also reflects lending by the treasury to public financial institutions, mainly the
national development bank. This lending does not affect the net public debt since the
government’s financial assets (public banks’ obligations to the treasury) increase
accordingly.
11.
The measurement of gross public debt has been a point of contention between
staff and the authorities for some time. Staff’s definition includes all treasury securities
held by the central bank. The authorities have explained at length why they consider

3
appropriate to exclude from gross debt numbers part of the securities in the central bank’s
portfolio, namely those that are not being used in liquidity-absorption repos. Only those
being used for this purpose actually represent liabilities with the public and should be
counted in the government’s debt.
12.
It should be noted that the Brazilian authorities adopted this methodology back in
2008 in a transparent and consistent manner. According to this methodology, the gross
debt to GDP ratio of the general government was 58.7 percent in December 2012.
Therefore, the IMF staff’s preferred definition overestimates the ratio of gross
government debt to GDP by almost 10 percentage points.
13.
Yet, even if we consider gross public debt under the IMF staff’s misleading
definition, the data do not confirm staff’s assertion that the downward trend in the gross
debt to GDP ratio has been reversed. This ratio was 64.2 percent in May 2013, 3.2
percentage points lower than at the end of the previous year and 1.7 percentage points
lower than in May 2012. This reduction is not captured in the figure in Box 7 since staff
has not included the most recent available data. Nevertheless, what the figure does clearly
show is the decline in the ratio of gross debt to GDP since 2002.
14.
Furthermore, the profile of public debt improved considerably in the last decade.
The average maturity of the federal debt has gradually been extended, whereas its
composition changed radically, entailing a substantial reduction in interest rate- and
exchange rate-related vulnerabilities. At end-2012, fixed interest rate securities accounted
for 41.2 percent of total federal debt, versus a mere 2.2 percent in 2002, while the share
of exchange rate-linked debt decreased from 22.4 percent to 0.6 percent of total debt, as
reported by staff. When its external assets are also considered, the Brazilian public sector
is a net external creditor (by as much as 14 percent of GDP). This provides an automatic
debt stabilizer when there is an external shock and the currency depreciates.
Monetary and financial sector policies
15.
From August 2011 to October 2012, the Central Bank of Brazil (BCB – Banco
Central do Brasil) lowered the policy rate by 525 basis points to 7.25 percent, bringing
both nominal and real rates to their lowest levels in recent Brazilian history. Price
pressures in the second half of 2012 – triggered in great part by the increase in food
prices in the international markets – brought twelve-month consumer inflation to 6.6
percent in March 2013. In order to keep inflation in check, the BCB started in April 2013
to gradually increase the policy rate, which now stands at 8.5 percent. Thus, monetary as
well as fiscal policies are being tightened despite the fact that growth recovery has only
recently begun.
16.
Inflation expectations have already responded to the increase in the policy rate.
The latest market projections from the BCB’s survey, published every Monday, indicate
that inflation is expected to remain under control, closing 2013 at the same level of 2012
and within the target range for the tenth consecutive year.

4
17.
Brazil’s financial sector regulation and supervision have traditionally been strong,
as recognized by IMF staff including in last year’s FSAP. Most 2012 FSAP
recommendations have been implemented or are in process of being implemented.
However, not all recommendations are considered appropriate. A case in point is the
recommendation to create a multi-partite, high-level financial stability committee. The
Brazilian authorities consider that the institutional arrangement for systemic risk
monitoring and coordination is adequate and does not require modification, for the
following reasons. First, the Financial Stability Committee is well placed in the central
bank, given that banks, which the BCB regulates and supervises, are the main potential
sources of systemic financial risk. Second, coordination with other regulators is ensured
by the Committee for Regulation and Supervision of Financial, Capital, Insurance,
Pension and Capitalization Markets (COREMEC – Comitê de Regulação e Fiscalização
dos Mercados Financeiro, de Capitais, de Seguros, de Previdência e Capitalização) as
well as by several Memoranda of Understanding between financial regulators. Finally,
top-level coordination is undertaken at the National Monetary Council (CMN – Conselho
Monetário Nacional), which is the highest financial system authority and congregates the
officials ultimately responsible for all regulatory institutions.
18.
Non-performing loans (NPLs) remain low, particularly in public banks, even
though the overall credit-to-GDP ratio has almost doubled over the last 8 years. Private
banks’ NPLs have increased somewhat but are below 5 percent of total loans, while
public banks’ NPLs have been stable at about 2 percent of total loans (see Table 7 of the
report). A substantial part of credit expansion has been connected to mortgages, which
were virtually non-existent until recently and are expected to continue growing at a fast
pace. Despite this recent growth, housing credit accounts for only 7 percent of GDP.
Recently, credit growth has moderated and housing prices have stabilized. According to
the BCB, staff’s concerns about financial stability and a possible large correction in the
real estate market seem overdone.
19.
Banks have sufficient capital to absorb even extreme shocks. Simulations by the
central bank, mentioned in Box 9 of the staff report, show that most banks will not need
to raise additional capital to comply with Basel III rules. The implementation of the Basel
III parameters will start in October 2013 and follow the internationally agreed timeline.
External sector
20.
At 2.4 percent of GDP, the current account deficit in 2012 was moderately higher
than in previous years, being however entirely financed by FDI inflows. In 2013, the
current account deficit has risen further and the central bank projects a deficit of 3.2
percent of GDP, nearly 90 percent of which covered by FDI. Despite the higher deficit,
Brazil’s external position remains solid given the relative stability of FDI and, more
importantly, high international reserves (US$ 369 billion dollars at end-June 2013). The
use of CFMs in times of abundant international liquidity has also contributed to limit the
country’s external vulnerability by containing excessive portfolio and other volatile
capital flows.

5
21.
Brazil’s capacity to attract long-term foreign capital remains strong. National
treasury bonds (Global 2023) were issued in the international markets in September 2012
and May 2013 at yields of 2.7 and 2.8 percent per year respectively, the lowest rates ever
for a Brazilian external bond issuance. Foreign direct investment (FDI) reached US$ 65
billion last year, positioning Brazil as the world’s fourth largest investment destination,
according to the UNCTAD 2013 World Investment Report.
Investment and employment
22.
The staff report may convey an excessively negative assessment of investment
activity in Brazil. We recognize that investment is still relatively low and that sustaining
adequate economic growth rates in the long-term will require substantial additional
efforts. But one should not neglect a number of indications that investment has begun to
recover. National Account data show that investment rebounded since the last quarter of
2012, particularly in the first quarter of 2013 when the annualized quarter-over-quarter
expansion reached almost 20 percent.
23.
Infrastructure investments have tripled in real terms over the last ten years,
reaching about US$ 100 billion in 2012, according to data published by the Finance
Ministry. The second phase of the Growth Acceleration Program (PAC – Programa de
Aceleração do Crescimento) is already showing results in areas such as urban
development, transportation and energy. In 2012, the government launched the Logistics
Investment Program (PIL – Programa de Investimento em Logística). The PIL focuses on
the renewal and integration of the Brazilian transportation network in partnership with the
private sector and consists of a wide range of concessions, including for highways,
railways, airports and ports. The auction for the construction of the railway and the
operation of the first high-speed train in Brazil is scheduled for next September. The
government is also proceeding with the 11th and 12th bidding rounds for gas exploration
and the first bidding round of the pre-salt oil layer. In the electricity sector, a series of
auctions will be carried out between 2013 and 2017 for the generation of 33,000 MW
from hydropower, wind power and other sources, as well as the installation of 23,200
kilometers of transmission lines. In order to foster investment projects in infrastructure, a
number of tax benefits and facilitating measures were enacted for resident and
nonresident investors, including innovative financing instruments such as infrastructure
debentures and receivables investment funds (FDICs – Fundos de Investimento em
Direitos Creditórios).
24.
Furthermore, the authorities have taken a series of other steps to increase the
country’s competitiveness and to encourage investment and production. Measures such as
the payroll tax relief for 40 economic sectors, the new automotive regime for 2013-2017,
and the program for reducing energy costs have improved competitiveness and are
conducive to higher economic growth.
25.
A dynamic labor market has been a key element in the improvement of living
standards in Brazil, an issue regrettably absent from the report. In 2012, the net creation
of formal jobs reached 1.3 million and the rate of urban unemployment fell to 5.5 percent,

6
a historical low. In total, more than 16 million formal jobs were created in the last ten
years, in what is likely the largest sustained employment creation in Brazilian history –
and possibly one of the largest in modern history in any country barring China.
Moreover, the share of the employed population with 11 years or more of schooling has
increased from 33.6 to 46.3 percent since 2004. The expansion of the formal labor market
coupled with targeted transfers to low-income households and higher education levels
have driven millions out of poverty and improved income distribution.
