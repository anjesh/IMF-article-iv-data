STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
May 16, 2012

KEY ISSUES
Short-term prospects. Real GDP growth is projected at 5 percent in 2012 thanks to
external tailwinds, strong gas export volumes, and mildly expansionary policies, which
are supporting domestic demand growth. The external current account and the fiscal
position are projected to show small surpluses. Downside risks in the short term are
mitigated by strong buffers. With the output gap estimated to have closed and
domestic demand strong, there is a risk of overheating.
Strengthening the policy framework. Against the background of their prudent
macroeconomic management of recent years, staff encouraged the authorities to move
decisively toward the adoption of a medium-term fiscal framework to manage the
hydrocarbon wealth. Staff also advised greater transparency and accountability in the
operations of public corporations as well as keeping the role of the central bank in
developmental policies limited.
Managing credit expansion. Much progress has been achieved in expanding access
to financial services by the population at large, amid improving financial soundness
indicators and a sharp decline in dollarization. Preserving these gains will require
monitoring the current credit expansion closely, maintaining banking sector buffers,
and continuing strengthening supervision. Recent initiatives to strengthen the crisis
management framework are welcome.
Achieving high medium-term growth and social inclusion. Meeting Bolivia’s large
infrastructure and development needs will require higher investment. Beyond ensuring
the stability of the legal framework, improvements can be achieved through a removal
of distortions and reducing microeconomic uncertainties. Social policies have been
effective and Bolivia has made inroads toward achieving the MDGs. Further improving
targeting and avoiding erosion in the real value of transfer programs will help further
improve the conditions of the most vulnerable groups.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

BOLIVIA

BACKGROUND
1.
Prudent macroeconomic policies,
accompanied by strong terms of trade, have
allowed Bolivia to achieve impressive
economic outcomes in recent years. Exports
of goods have tripled since 2005, reflecting
increased volumes of gas, mineral, and
agricultural products, and the decade-long
boom in commodity prices. Real GDP growth,
which averaged 3.3 percent annually during
1996–2005, rose to an average of 4.7 percent
during 2006–11. The fiscal position
strengthened sharply, as larger export receipts,
higher taxation of hydrocarbon production,
and moderate rates of increase in government
spending led to substantial fiscal surpluses.
The external current account also registered
surpluses, contributing to the build-up of a
strong reserves buffer, now equivalent to close
to 50 percent of GDP. Combined with the debt
relief obtained under MDRI, these
developments have helped Bolivia become a
net external creditor country since 2008. In
2011, gross NFPS debt declined to less than
35 percent of GDP and net debt to only
14 percent, reflecting the accumulation of
large general government deposits at the
central bank.

2.
Strong results have also been
achieved on improving social inclusion and
income distribution. Cash transfer programs
have been successful in lowering extreme
poverty, while investment in infrastructure has
helped improve access to basic services (water
and sanitations, energy) and transportation
(mainly roads). Various initiatives have also
been launched to support small businesses,
generating employment and providing income
stability to informal and vulnerable workers. To
strengthen food security, the government has
limited exports of certain products (sugar,
soybeans, corn, meats) while reducing import
tariffs on others and on inputs for their
production. Social challenges persist, however,
including still-high levels of poverty, infant
mortality, and long-standing inequalities
(Annex I).

Private investment has remained
subdued, amid lingering uncertainty about
the legal framework. The new constitution
(2009), which gives the State a primary role in
economic affairs, requires amending key
economic laws, including those governing the
central bank, the financial sector, the
exploitation of natural resources, and intergovernmental fiscal relations. Social and
regional disputes have also persisted,

BOLIVIA

including with respect to revenue-sharing
arrangements and the location of
infrastructure.
4.
In completing the 2011 Article IV
consultation, the Executive Board
welcomed Bolivia’s strong economic
performance, underpinned by prudent
macroeconomic policies. Directors concurred
that the main short-term priority was to
contain inflation, and stressed that meeting
developmental needs and making inroads into

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

poverty reduction remained the main mediumterm objectives (Box 1).
5.
Exchange system and statistics. Bolivia
has accepted the obligations under Article
VIII, sections 2, 3, and 4. The exchange
system is free of restrictions on the making of
payments and transfers for current
international transactions. Despite
shortcomings, data provision to the Fund is
broadly adequate for surveillance.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOKS AND RISKS
A. Recent Developments
6.
In 2011, economic activity remained
robust amid strong domestic demand
growth. Real GDP grew 5.2 percent, led by
domestic services, construction, and
hydrocarbons production. After a sharp
increase at the beginning of 2011,
twelve-month inflation gradually declined to
4 percent in March 2012, reflecting a softening
in international food prices, price agreements
in agriculture, and a gradual re-anchoring of
expectations. In 2011, domestic demand grew
briskly, with imports climbing over 40 percent
with respect to 2010. As a result, the external
current account surplus narrowed from close
to 5 percent of GDP to 2¼ percent of GDP,
despite record-high export prices.
International reserves rose to over 80 percent
of M2 (which includes dollar denominated
deposits), and about 50 percent of GDP
(Figures 1 and 2).
7.
Policies have been broadly
accommodative. The overall surplus of the
public sector fell from 1.7 percent of GDP in
2010 to 0.8 percent of GDP in 2012.
Revenue performance improved significantly,
as collections registered a 25 percent increase

in real terms. This strength was particularly
evident in the corporate income tax and VAT,
reflecting both improved compliance and
higher commodity prices and imports. At the
same time, public investment picked up
strongly, contributing to a fiscal impulse of
about 1 percent of GDP (Figures 3 and 4).1 In
the monetary area, after a tightening in
monetary conditions in early 2011, in response
to the pickup in inflation, the central bank has
been reducing the pace of liquidity withdrawal,
allowing for a resurgence in excess bank
liquidity (to above 5 percent of deposits).
Banks have continued to expand credit to the
private sector at a fairly brisk pace (above 20
percent y/y in nominal terms). During the
course of 2011, the central bank let the
Boliviano appreciate slightly (1.3 percent).

1

Following standard practice in commodity exporting
countries, the fiscal impulse is computed as the
change in the cyclically –adjusted non-commodity
primary balance.

B. Outlook and Risks
8.
Growth prospects remain favorable in
the near term, reflecting continued strength
in the natural resource sector and private
demand. Staff projects real GDP growth at
5 percent in 2012, in the context of still
high terms-of-trade and accommodative
policies. Gas production and export volumes
are expected to increase, while construction
and services would continue leading GDP
growth.
9.
With the output gap closed,2 there are
some risks that rapid demand growth could
lead to overheating. Inflation is projected at
about 5 percent in 2012, assuming that food
prices continue to trend down, with the
strength of domestic demand representing
some upside risks. A concern is that the
upward trend in consumption and real estate
growth would not be curbed early enough.
Measured at constant prices, domestic
demand has grown consistently above GDP in
recent years, leading to declining net exports.
And despite broadly similar terms of trade to
those in 2008 (the previous peak), the external
current account surplus has narrowed
significantly since then (a drop of about 10
percentage points of GDP). Unemployment is
now at record low levels (5½ percent), wages
are rising—wages are up 8 percent and this
year the minimum wage will increase by
22 percent—and shortages, albeit temporarily,
have surfaced in the distribution of electricity.

10.
In the near term, downside risks
from a more adverse external environment
are mitigated by the strong financial
buffers that Bolivia has built up in recent
years. Staff estimates that the first round effect
of a decline in commodity prices—of around
20 percent for oil and minerals, and somewhat
less for food3—would result in a deterioration
of 5½ percentage points of GDP in the
external current account balance and 2 percent
of GDP in the overall fiscal balance. Bolivia’s
international reserves and government
deposits at the central bank—equivalent to 50
percent and 20 percent of GDP, respectively—
would be more than adequate to buffer such a
temporary adverse external shock. Moreover,
external public debt has declined sharply in
recent years and remains low at 14 percent of
GDP, and a decline in gas export prices would
take time to materialize, since existing
contracts with regional partners follow
international fuel prices with a lag of about six
months.

Prospects over the medium term are

also favorable, and risks to the outlook are
mainly associated with high commodity
dependency and low levels of private
investment. Under staff’s baseline scenario, the
economy will grow slightly above its observed
long-term trend, assuming the maintenance of
policies steered to anchor low level of inflation
and maintain a small fiscal surplus—consistent
with the government’s track record since 2006.
But this scenario is subject to risks:
Commodity dependency is high, accounting
for roughly 90 percent of exports and
30 percent of fiscal revenue. As a result,
Bolivia is vulnerable to a sustained fall in

are not developed, which would require a
prompt increase in exploration activity. If
prices or volumes of commodity exports
(especially hydrocarbons) were to be affected
significantly on a sustained basis (tail risk),
policy adjustments, possibly in the form of a
stronger non-hydrocarbon fiscal balance and
a weaker real exchange rate, would be
required. Financial sector developments
would need to be carefully monitored in this
scenario, given the significant increase in the
size of the banking sector in recent years.

data do not fully capture private sector
investment, particularly in the informal sector of
the economy. If this part of investment turned
out to be significant, it is conceivable that longterm growth could be higher than estimated at
present.

The authorities disagreed with the

balance of the risks presented by staff and
stressed that their policies were aimed at

BOLIVIA

mitigating other key risks. In the short-term,
they viewed the deterioration of the external
environment as the key risk. They agreed that
financial cushions are ample enough and
stressed that the 2008-09 experience had
shown the resilience of the Bolivian economy
and demonstrated its low exposure to global
financial sector distress. They believed that, in
the current context, overheating would be
highly unlikely, including because their policies
would expand supply. The authorities also

underscored that their policies were aimed at
mitigating medium-term downside risks,
including through the additional public
investment to expand gas and mineral
production and to develop these sectors
downstream. They also expressed confidence
that recent incentives to spur private sector
investment in the hydrocarbon sector (see
below) would contribute to higher growth and
lower commodity dependency.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Discussions focused on the appropriate policy mix for 2012 and on medium-term
challenges to achieving strong, sustained, and inclusive growth. Staff recommended the
adoption of policies aimed at reducing overheating risks in the short-term and noted that
Bolivia is in a solid position to sustain economic growth and poverty reduction over the
medium term, through an increase in private investment and the efficient
implementation of ambitious public investment plans.

A. Fiscal Policy
13.
To reduce upside risks to inflation
and maintain strong financial cushions,
staff suggested aiming at a somewhat
higher fiscal balance in 2012. Over the past
few years, fiscal policy has been appropriately
geared to smoothing out the effects of
external shocks. However, the output gap is
estimated to have closed, and some fiscal
impulse (½ percent of GDP) is projected for

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

2012. The authorities considered that this
modest impulse was appropriate, given the
risks of a slowdown in activity. They
highlighted that public investment would
remain high, as required for the development
of infrastructure and the process of
industrialization based on natural resources.

Risks on the spending side call for
an improvement in the non-hydrocarbon
fiscal balance over the medium term. The
non-hydrocarbon fiscal balance4 is projected
to reach a deficit of 9½ percent of GDP in
2012, consistent with public spending
equivalent to 35½ percent of GDP. Based on
staff’s projections, the non-hydrocarbon fiscal
deficit would decline below 8 percent of GDP
over the medium-term, as higher interest rates
on net international reserves would boost
government revenue. Staff noted that this
fiscal scenario is subject to risks on the
spending side, as ambitious investment plans
in various ministries may not be consistent
with the objective of maintaining investment at
about 13 percent of GDP over the medium
term. In addition, there is a need to strengthen
incentives to private domestic oil production
(see paragraph 25), which will require
adjusting prices paid to producers by the
state-owned oil company or reducing high
taxes on oil production. The authorities agreed
that investment could rise beyond the
projected levels but emphasized that
macroeconomic stability was high among
government priorities and that the
sustainability of fiscal policy would not be

balance minus the hydrocarbon balance (hydrocarbon

gas company).

compromised. Staff recommended financing
additional capital spending through further
improvements in the non-hydrocarbon fiscal
balance.
15.
A gradual reduction in energy
subsidies would strengthen the nonhydrocarbons fiscal balance. To offset
additional outlays related to investment or
current expenditure,5 staff suggested a gradual
reduction in fuel subsidies.6 Guided by
international experience in that area, staff
considered that, to be successful, such a
reduction would need to be accompanied by
better targeting of social policies to protect
the most vulnerable groups and/or special
policies for public transportation. 7 Staff also
noted that, in line with earlier technical
assistance work, there was some space to
strengthen direct taxation as well. The
authorities, however, indicated that social
resistance to both reducing fuel subsidies and
increasing direct taxation were likely to
prevent changes to policies in these areas.
16.
The authorities plan to diversify
financing sources. The authorities intend,
conditions permitting, to issue sovereign debt
in the international markets in an amount of
US$500 million in the coming months. While
financing needs are not pressing in 2012, the
authorities’ objective is to develop a financing
alternative for investment over the medium5

A larger role of the State in economic activity may
give rise to higher current spending, and social
spending may also need to increase.
6

If fully eliminated, staff estimates that net public
sector revenue could increase by 4-6½ percent of
GDP, depending on demand elasticity.
7

Subsidy reforms accompanied by a strengthening of
social policies include the cases of Indonesia (2005,
2008), Iran (2010), Jordan (2005), and Mozambique
(2008).

BOLIVIA

term. While supporting the diversification of
financing sources, staff encouraged the
authorities to develop a debt and investment
strategy in the context of a medium-term fiscal
framework, including with integrated scenarios
of public investment and financing needs. Staff
also noted that the issuance of an international
bond would help establish a benchmark for
access to foreign financing by the private
sector. To reduce the carrying cost of debt and
make public sector cash management more
efficient, staff and the authorities agreed that
efforts to mobilize the savings of subnational
governments (now earning no interest on
deposits at the central bank) should continue,
including through the voluntary placement of
central government paper.
17.
Staff cautioned against excessive
central bank financing to public
corporations. So far, the central bank has
been authorized to lend the equivalent of
almost US$5 billion, or about 40 percent of
NIRs, to public corporations and development
projects. The central bank board has already
approved the terms for about US$2 billion of
this lending, which will be granted in local
currency at fixed interest rates below
1 percent, and with at a maturity of at least
20 years. Staff noted that central bank lending
for developmental purposes is strictly limited
in most countries (Box 3) and expressed
concern that the size and terms of these
operations could result in quasi-fiscal losses
for the central bank, especially under adverse
external scenarios.8 In that respect, staff noted
8

Risks are currently limited, since reserve
accumulation is expected to continue and most of
central bank liabilities are in local currency and at zero
rates (government deposits and monetary base are
equivalent to about US$11.2 billion). But both factors
could change significantly in different macroeconomic
circumstances.

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

that the central bank does not have expertise
in assessing commercial and industrial risks.
Thus, staff urged caution in the granting of
new financing and the pace of disbursement of
approved loans, through a strict prioritization
of public investment plans. The authorities
emphasized that the level and terms of central
bank lending took into consideration current
economic conditions, expected risks, and the
need to ensure implementation of their
economic and development plans. They
underscored that price stability would not be
subordinated to any other objectives.
18.
Staff encouraged the authorities to
advance with their plans to set up a
medium-term fiscal framework (MTFF) for
the exploitation of natural resources. In
recent years, the authorities have conducted
fiscal policy skillfully, attaining a good balance
between saving part of the gas windfall and
strengthening social policies and investment.
Given that the risk of macroeconomic volatility
from commodity boom-bust cycles is
important, staff recommended that mediumterm fiscal policy be guided by the objective of
avoiding pro-cyclical spending while building
strong buffers for insurance purposes in a
stabilization fund.9 A MTFF would also help
introduce intergenerational equity
considerations in the design of fiscal policy, as
natural resource depletion would be balanced
against strong developmental needs. The
authorities indicated that these objectives were
consistent with their policy agenda and
expected that consensus would gradually build
toward these ends. They indicated that work
had started to project revenues and

BOLIVIA

expenditures on a multi-year basis, and that
these projections would soon be attached to

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

the annual Budget for discussion in congress.

B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
19.
Staff noted that keeping inflation
expectations well anchored at a low level
could require some monetary tightening.
Interest rates remain low, and are negative in
real terms for deposits. At the same time,
excess liquidity in the banking sector is high,
which could potentially fuel higher credit
growth levels. In that context, staff
recommended taking steps to reduce the
monetary impulse with a view to avoid feeding
too rapid consumption growth. The authorities
indicated that they would be ready to tighten,
if warranted by inflation or external
developments, but did not think that such a
tightening was needed at this stage. They also
noted that inflation expectations were well
anchored and that there was no strong
evidence that asset prices were out of line with
fundamentals. The authorities also considered
that higher credit expansion would help
support economic activity amid global and
regional output deceleration.
20.
With respect to the exchange rate
arrangement, the central bank reiterated its
view that the current crawling peg regime
provides the flexibility needed to manage

imbalances. Staff and the authorities agreed
that there was no immediate need to alter the
exchange rate level, given the presence of a
high reserves buffer and no clear evidence of
exchange rate misalignment (Box 2). Staff
noted that banking sector dollarization has
declined in recent years, to currently
encompass less than 40 percent of deposits
and 30 percent of loans. This, in staff’s view,
creates favorable conditions for the
introduction of a crawling band, under which
additional exchange rate flexibility could be
introduced while avoiding unduly high
volatility. Staff also commented that the
introduction of a higher degree of exchange
rate flexibility over the medium term would be
important in helping the economy adjust to
terms-of-trade shocks. The authorities,
however, did not think that conditions have
matured sufficiently to justify a shift toward
more flexibility. Rather, they strongly argued
against changes to their current policies. They
observed that exchange rate stability has been
a key factor behind Bolivia’s strong economic
performance as, in their view, excessive
exchange rate volatility adversely affects
private sector confidence.

C. Financial Sector Policy
21.
With strong financial sector
indicators, and in the context of high credit
growth, staff and the authorities agreed
that close monitoring of financial sector
conditions remained important. Staff
welcomed the authorities’ recent decisions to
increase provisioning requirements and to

continue assessing bank risks to adverse
scenarios, including through stress tests.10 The
authorities expressed their satisfaction for
having attained a good balance between

moderating inflation and ensuring continued
credit expansion. Staff cautioned that credit
growth might need to moderate further and
suggested to continue aiming at gradual rise
in short-term interest rates to increase
incentives for savings.
22.
To contribute to a moderation of
credit growth, staff suggested the use of
reserve requirements and other
macroprudential measures. In particular,
staff argued in favor of increasing reserve
requirements on local currency deposits,
now at an effective rate of 7 percent.11 This,
together with other macro-prudential
measures, would help strengthen buffers in the
financial sector while reducing the cost of
sterilization. The authorities expressed the view
that the adequacy of regulations in the
banking sector was assessed on a regular basis
and they saw no need for changes at this
stage. They noted, however, that reserve
requirements on dollar deposits (currently at
an effective rate of about 27 percent) are well
above those on boliviano deposits and are
scheduled to rise further over time, in an effort
to contribute further to de-dollarization and to
absorb excess liquidity.
23.
Staff and the authorities discussed
plans to strengthen financial sector
legislation. Staff welcomed the adoption of
some of the FSAP recommendations and plans
to: (i) enhance the financial system safety net,
with the introduction of a limited deposit
insurance scheme, without direct cost to the

government;12 and (ii) maintain strong capital
requirements, by giving bank supervisors
authority to request capital increases beyond
minimum levels with a view to reducing procyclical behavior. The authorities also noted
that they were exploring mechanisms to
enhance access to credit for productive
purposes and for low-income housing. Staff
emphasized the need to avoid measures of
direct control of credit or interest rates.
Instead, enhanced access to credit should be
delivered through special programs that
transparently establish instruments and costs
through the budget.
24.
The authorities are working toward
strengthening AML/CFT regulations, to
comply with international norms. In its
recent assessment, the FATF has identified
areas for strengthening in the AML/CFT
framework. There was agreement with the
authorities that aligning domestic practices
and the legal framework with international
norms will be important to protect the
reputation of Bolivia’s financial sector as well
as its access to external financing. In this
direction, a strengthened strategy for the
Financial Intelligence Unit, including with the
hiring of more personnel, has been launched,
and work has started to address weaknesses in
the regulatory framework for AML/CFT,
including with technical assistance from the
Fund.

D. Structural Policies
25.
Staff recommended moving ahead
with the enactment of key economic laws to
remove deterrents to private investment,
highlighting that sector policies could be
enhanced to quickly spur investment.
Despite the launching of a large number of
initiatives to support micro and small business,
a comprehensive strategy to promote
investment by medium and large private
enterprises still needs to be developed. With a
few exceptions, the formalization of jobs and
new investment has been hampered by
uncertainties in the legal framework that
remain unresolved (hydrocarbons law, mining
law, commerce code, labor code). In addition,
to ensure a level playing field in the productive
sectors of the economy, there seems to be a
need to better specify the scope of public
sector intervention while ensuring that, at all
times, the process of compensation of the
former owners of nationalized companies is
fair and swift. Against this background, staff
made the following suggestions based on
international experience: (i) in the hydrocarbon
sector, gradually increase domestic fuel prices
to limit the cost of subsidies; lower taxation
(especially, taxes of 50 percent on the value of
production) to provide better incentives for
local production of oil; and approve the new
legal framework to jump start private
exploration; (ii) in agriculture, facilitate the
adoption of new technology to improve yields
and reduce uncertainties that prevent
investment and bank financing; (iii) in the
electricity sector, the new framework law
should promptly clarify pricing policies—
balancing social and developmental needs
with incentives for the expansion of generation
capacity through adequate cost recovery—and
the scope of participation by the private
sector.

26.
The authorities noted that finalizing
the legal framework would require more
time to consult with stakeholders, and that
new public sector initiatives were designed
to boost private investment. In oil and gas,
the state-owned holding YPFB has launched a
campaign to attract investment in more than
50 exploration areas, conducting road shows
worldwide that were well received. In addition,
new incentives to spur additional production
of liquid fuels have been enacted,13 and a
number of investments are being undertaken
to add value to gas production. In agriculture,
financial support programs (insurance and
guarantee funds) and support to small
producers by the state-owned food company
Emapa have helped expand production. In
electricity, new generation plants have been
installed to satisfy demand and energy-saving
initiatives have been launched.
27.
Staff recommended adopting a
stronger framework for investment
evaluation and to support efficiency in the
operations of public corporations. The
increasing role of the state in the production
of goods and services through state-owned
enterprises (SOEs) warrants a stronger
governance framework to ensure effectiveness
in their operations while minimizing fiscal risks.
While the authorities have made progress with
the setting up of SEDEM, an agency designed
to coordinate and enhance the operations and
management of small enterprises, a broader
strategy is needed to encompass all public
corporations. Such a strategy should include

If the incentives are successful, the costs to the
budget may be very small or negative, since imports of

best corporate practices to reduce fiscal risks,
including independent pricing and
employment policies. The elaboration of
reports on performance and risks—including
the evaluations of scenarios simulated at lower
commodity prices—and external audits of the
financial statements would also help improve
transparency. The authorities reported that
work on a new law for Public Corporations was
advancing and that it would incorporate some
of these recommendations.
28.
Staff welcomed progress in social
policies, which has allowed Bolivia to make
inroads toward achieving its Millennium

Development Goals. While supporting the
government strategy, staff noted that
maintaining the effectiveness of social
spending would require more public resources
over time. In particular, social policy should
aim at maintaining the real value of transfer
programs (benefits have been constant in
nominal terms in the last two years) and
enhancing the delivery of education and
health services—a priority given still-high
levels of infant mortality and child
malnutrition. In preparing the budget, staff
encouraged the authorities to weigh the
benefits of additional social spending against
those of large investment projects.

STAFF APPRAISAL
29.
The Bolivian economy maintained a
strong performance in 2011. Real GDP
growth accelerated, on the back of strong
terms-of-trade and accommodative policies.
Strong demand growth led to a narrowing of
the external current account surplus and,
despite buoyant revenue, the fiscal surplus
declined due to fiscal impulse. Net
international reserves climbed to new highs,
thus offering strong protection to external
shocks. Bank credit continued to expand at
rapid rates, amid strong financial soundness
indicators.
30.
The outlook for 2012 is favorable
and short term downside risks are
manageable. Real GDP is expected to
continue growing at a fast pace, reflecting still
high terms of trade and mildly expansionary
policies. The external current account and the
fiscal balance are expected to remain in
surplus. Downside risks from an adverse
external environment are limited by strong
financial cushions and proven resilience of the
Bolivian economy to financial shocks.

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

31.
A shift in macroeconomic policies to
a more neutral level might be required to
consolidate the decline in inflation and
reduce overheating risk. The envisaged fiscal
impulse is modest, but a higher fiscal balance
would help offset strong private demand
growth. The central bank may want to absorb
part of the large excess liquidity in the banking
sector with a view to slowing credit growth
and seeking a gradual increase in short-term
and deposit interest rates.
32.
Given the outlook for commodity
prices, projected fiscal spending for 2012 is
compatible with a sustainable fiscal
position over the medium term. Under
current policies, public debt will remain on a
downward path over the next few years, as the
nonfinancial public sector is expected to run
modest surpluses.
33.
To protect public investment and
make room for higher social spending, a
strengthening of the non-hydrocarbon
balance is recommended. Increasing

BOLIVIA

productive and social investment—while
containing current expenditure—would require
either higher revenue or reducing other
spending. Reducing fuel subsidies, with
appropriate compensatory measures, and
strengthening direct taxation would help to
make space for these additional outlays.
34.
Reforms to the policy framework,
building on the authorities’ plans, will help
improve policy responses to changing
economic conditions. Setting up a mediumterm fiscal framework for the exploitation of
natural resources would help avoid pro-cyclical
fiscal spending and build buffers to insure
against commodity price volatility. It will also
help introduce intergenerational equity
considerations in the design of fiscal policy, as
natural resource depletion is balanced against
strong development needs.
35.
Limiting the role of the central bank
in financing public investment would help
reinforce the strength of monetary policy.
In line with international experience, central
bank financing for development purposes
should be limited, to avoid the emergence of
quasi-fiscal losses, especially under adverse
external scenarios. As lower dollarization
becomes more entrenched and domestic
financial markets develop further, the
authorities will have room to move toward
greater exchange rate flexibility.
36.
The expansion of public sector
involvement in productive activities and
investment should be accompanied by a
stronger governance and accountability
framework. A strategy encompassing all
public corporations, as planned with the
enactment of a new law for Public Enterprises,
is needed. Elements of the legal framework
should include a requirement that financial

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

statements be externally audited; that the cost
of quasi-fiscal operations be disclosed; and
that reports be elaborated on the performance
of companies and the risks they face. In
tandem, there is a need to step up efforts to
ensure the effectiveness of public spending
and enhance implementation capacity across
all levels of government.
37.
Building on important
improvements in the financial sector,
further strengthening is needed to ensure
macro-financial stability. Financial sector
indicators are strong, but credit expansion
needs to be monitored closely and banking
sector buffers maintained. Staff welcomes the
progress in the adoption of FSAP
recommendations. Plans to strengthen the
financial system safety net, with the
introduction of a limited deposit insurance,
should help consolidate the strength of the
banking sector. In addition, direct controls on
the price and allocation of credit should be
avoided. To preserve Bolivia’s financial system
integrity, the AML/CFT regime should be
rapidly strengthened to comply with
international norms.
38.
Sustaining high and stable mediumterm growth will require improvements in
the business environment. A key challenge
will be to adapt the legal framework for natural
resources and private investment to the
mandates of the Constitution in a way that
ensures clear and stable rules of the game for
the private sector. Clearly defining the scope
of public sector operations while ensuring a
fair and swift process of compensation of the
former owners of nationalized companies
would also contribute to reducing risk
perceptions.

Box 1. Fund Policy Recommendations and Implementation
Monetary and exchange rate policy. Directors recommended rapid exit from the monetary stimulus and a
moderate appreciation of the currency to help reduce inflationary pressures. Over the medium term,
directors suggested greater exchange rate flexibility to enhance the economy’s capacity to respond to
external shocks.
The authorities responded to rising inflation by withdrawing liquidity through open market operations,
especially in the first half of 2011. The Boliviano was allowed to appreciate slightly during the year.
Fiscal policy. Directors stressed the importance of increasing productive and social investment to address
developmental needs, while enhancing the effectiveness of public spending and implementation capacity
across all levels of government. Directors welcomed plans to introduce multi-year budgeting and a fiscal
savings fund to facilitate anti-cyclical policies and encouraged the authorities to limit fiscal claims on the
central bank and enhance the transparency of state owned enterprises.
The authorities are working on multi-year framework to guide fiscal policy and budget planning and envisage
basing their budget projections on prudent estimates of oil and gas prices to generate savings and accumulate
them in a fiscal fund. They indicated that they continue to work on a framework law for public corporations,
which would provide tools for enhanced management and governance.
Financial sector. Directors highlighted the need to continue improvements in the financial sector in line
with FSAP recommendations, especially to ensure appropriate levels of banks’ liquidity and capital buffers.
They suggested to avoid using interest rate policy and prudential rules for development purposes,
recommended strengthening financial sector supervision more broadly, and considered that deposit
insurance would be a useful addition to the crisis management framework.
Implementation of recommendations is underway (details are presented in Annex II).
Structural policies. Directors stressed the need to improve investment climate through further reforms of
the legal framework to ensure clear and stable rules for the private sector. They also called for strengthened
social policies, improving further the targeting of transfer programs, facilitating the reduction of fuel
subsidies, and introducing free price setting in agriculture.
Envisaged legal reforms in the mining and hydrocarbons sectors are still under discussion. The reform of the
fuel pricing policy is subject to political constraints. The authorities believe that price and trade controls in
agriculture are necessary to limit speculation and ensure food security.

Box 2. Exchange Rate Assessment
Staff estimates based on CGER methodologies suggest that the Boliviano is currently roughly in
line with fundamentals. There are some uncertainties associated with the application of these
methodologies to Bolivia, since:
 they do not fully incorporate the implications of the exhaustion of natural resources within a
predictable timeframe and the associated intergenerational considerations that may drive net assets
accumulation in the near term;
 current account volatility is particularly high in Bolivia because of commodity price fluctuations,
which makes it difficult to separate underlying trends from temporary changes, complicating the
estimation of the underlying current account balance;
 the Bolivian economy has experienced large structural changes in recent years and, hence, past
values of fundamental variables may be poor guides of their future levels.
With these caveats in mind, on average, the CGER approaches indicate a slight overvaluation of 2 percent,
well within the margin of error typical of these estimates. The result is primarily driven by the
Macroeconomic Balance (MA) approach. In particular, lower commodity prices and higher imports
projected over the medium term have reduced the underlying current account balance (CAB), requiring a
mild weakening of the real exchange rate to close the gap with the estimated current account norm. The
other two approaches indicate smaller deviations of the Boliviano from the fundamentals.
 The Macroeconomic Balance (MB) approach
indicates that a weakening of Bolivia’s real effective
exchange rate (REER) would be needed to close the
difference between the underlying CAB and the
current account norm. This result hinges on an
underlying CAB that is roughly balanced, and a
current account norm estimated at 2.6 percent of
GDP. The level of the current account norm reflects
mainly relatively high hydrocarbon trade and fiscal
balances, and low old-age dependency ratios.

 The External Sustainability (ES) approach suggests that the Boliviano is overvalued by 1.5 percent.
This assumes that Bolivia’s net foreign assets would stabilize at their end-2011 level (18 percent of
GDP), requiring a CAB of 1 percent of GDP.
 The Equilibrium Real Exchange Rate (ERER) approach points to undervaluation of about
0.3 percent. The model calculates the equilibrium REER on the basis of the terms of trade, net foreign
assets, public expenditure, FDI, and relative productivity. The results of the model, however, are
subject to a higher degree of uncertainty compared with the other two approaches. Firstly, the model
does not take into account the significant structural changes of Bolivian economy in the estimation
period, especially those associated with the production of natural gas. In addition, the specification is
not fully robust, as the coefficient of the terms of trade variable has a negative sign, in contrast with
the expected positive effect that terms of trade should have on the real exchange rate.

Box 3. Central Bank Lending: Bolivia and International Practices
In line with the government’s development strategy, central bank financing of public enterprises and
other development projects has been authorized in recent years. Overall lending approved between
2009 and 2012, including the recently-approved establishment of FINPRO, and investment fund, is
equivalent to US$4.8 billion. Of this total, only 11.5 percent has been disbursed so far. According to the
terms of approved central bank loans so far, they are extended in Bolivianos at highly concessional rates (0.9
percent on average), with maturities ranging from 20-30 years.

According to a recent study,1 concessional financing by central bank to public corporations is rare.
About two-thirds of the countries in the sample of 152 advanced and developing economies prohibit central
bank lending to the government or restrict it to short-term loans. Most advanced economies do not allow
central bank financing to the government for development purposes, while in some countries in Latin
America, for example, Brazil, Chile and Guatemala; it is banned in the constitution.

Some developing countries permit limited, short-term financing to the government on close-tomarket terms to smooth out revenue fluctuations. In those countries, the beneficiary is exclusively central
government, rather than public corporations, with a few exceptions like Jordan, Nicaragua, Pakistan and
Yemen. The maturity of central bank loans tends to be short (around 180 days, and up to a year in some
African countries and the Caribbean). The amount of lending, if allowed, is limited and defined as proportion
of the national budget (5 percent of government expenditures in Costa Rica or 25 percent of national
budget in Bahrain).

Annex I. Bolivia: Advances and Challenges in Social Policies1
A. Most Recent Development in Social Indicators
1.
Higher economic growth has allowed materializing important improvements in the
social front. Since 2006 the Bolivian economy has doubled in size and by 2011 constitutes a
nominal GDP of USD24.6 billions. In turn, GDP per capita has reached USD2,200 in 2011 increasing
from USD1,200 5 years before. In 2005, 60.6 percent of the population was living under moderate
poverty conditions and 38.2 percent was experiencing extreme poverty. In 2011 these indicators
have fallen to 48.5 and 24.3 percent, respectively.
2.
Bolivia has maintained social expenditure roughly constant in terms of GDP since 2005.
In 2011 expenditures in education, social protection, health and housing added up to 12.5 percent
of output. Education is the largest item in this total (51 percent), followed by social protection (33
percent), health (14 percent) and housing (2 percent). Investment related to social policies has also
been important. Investment in the areas of health and social security, education and culture, basic
sanitation and urbanism and housing represented 28 percent of public investment in 2007 and are
expected to constitute 24 percent of the total in 2012.

Social programs have been introduced with the objective of benefiting the most
vulnerable sectors of the population. Some of them have taken the form of cash-transfers and
others have been implemented thorough subsidies.
4.

The main programs that encompass Bolivia’s social safety net include:
a.

Bono ―Juancito Pinto,‖ which aims to increase school attendance and basic education
completion rate by providing an annual USD30 financial assistance to students attending
public schools for grades 1 through 8.

Prepared by Francisco Arizala and Manuel Rosales.

b.

Bono ―Juana Azurduy,‖ aimed to reduce child and maternal mortality by providing up to
a total of USD50 in prenatal and post delivery care as well as around USD225 for early
childhood care, over a two year period for pregnant women not covered by the social
security system.

c.

Universal pension benefit ―Renta Dignidad‖, which provides a USD30 monthly transfer to
persons over age 60 not covered by the pension system. The pension is reduced to
75 percent of the monthly amount if the person receives other pension income.

d.

A pension reform that introduced a semi-contributive pillar, which complements
contributive pensions that are below certain thresholds.

e.

Generalized fuel subsidies, with domestic fuel prices representing on average 40 percent
of international prices in 2011.

f.

An electricity subsidy equivalent to 25 percent of the regular tariff is assigned to homes
consuming less than 70 kwh/month.

B. Progress Towards Achieving the Millennium Development Goals1
5.
Between 2000 and 2007 public
expenditure in social programs targeted to
improve the MDG indicators increased
from USD548 million to USD968. In 2007,
this expenditure represented 7.4 percent
of GDP. This spending has been prioritized
towards achieving universal primary
education, reduce child mortality and improve
maternal health, and ensure environmental
sustainability.

The efforts concentrated in reducing
the under-five mortality rate and improving maternal health have been particularly successful. At
the national level, the under-five mortality rate halved between 1989 and 2008. The authorities are
confident that if this trend were to be maintained, the MDG in this area would be reached. In turn, the
proportion of deliveries attended by skilled health personnel has increased significantly from 33 percent
in 1996 to 67 percent in 2009, very close to the MDG of 70.

C. Social Challenges
9.
Bolivia remains among the poorest countries in the Latin American and Caribbean region.
Furthermore, there are important differences among indigenous and non indigenous groups. At 58
percent, the poverty rate for indigenous groups is higher compared to national levels (53.1 percent).
Extreme poverty rate affects 34 percent of the latter compared to 26 percent for non-indigenous people.
10.
Bolivia Bolivia’s health indicators remain below neighboring countries. Despite
improvements, child and maternal mortality rates remain high and water and sanitation coverage are low,
especially in the rural and poor-marginal urban areas. More unfavorable conditions reflect the fact that
large part of the rural population live in remote areas with limited access to basic services. According to
the World Bank, only two thirds of the population in rural areas has access to water and 9 percent to
sanitation services.

Recommendations

Authorities Response
Macro Prudential

Keep real lending rates positive to avoid unsound
credit growth.

Real interest rates remain negative on deposits and
positive on credit. Interest rates have increased
moderately in real estate lending.

Supervisory Framework
Enhance independence of the financial regulatory
agency: avoid interim appointment of the
executive director of ASFI and specify the
conditions for dismissal in the law.

ASFI’s Interim Executive Director was appointed in
2011. ASFI staff commented that they perceive ASFI to
be sufficiently independent and to be able to
coordinate with the Central Bank and the Ministry of
Finance.

Align ASFI’s internal capacity and resources with
their growing workload and responsibilities.

ASFI is planning to hire about 30 additional staff,
especially in the FIU unit and is in the process of
obtaining the budget for that purpose.

Commercial Banking Sector
Ensure that classification and provisioning
requirements are based solely on credit risk
considerations.

Provisioning requirements are partially based on
credit risk considerations and partially reflect
government’s policy to direct credit to productive
sectors away from consumption and real estate.
Overall, ASFI increased the requirement of cyclical
provisions in the course of 2011, strengthening the
coverage of risks in bank portfolios. In particular, it
raised provisions on credit for consumption and
reduced provisions for credit to productive sectors.

Eliminate limits on total foreign investments as a
share of capital.

According to ASFI, commercial banks are allowed to
invest abroad up to 50 percent of their capital. This
limit has not been changed or eliminated.

Add market risk (interest rate and forex) to capital
requirements.

Revisions of the capital requirement regulations
implemented in 2011 added market risk to capital
requirements. However, it did not distinguish between
forex and interest rate risks.

Complete work on operational and interest rate
risk guidance.

Risk guidance is work in progress and is expected to
be completed by June 2012. It will include separate
regulations for overall and operational risks.

Authorities Response

Make the financing of terrorism a criminal act;
provide the FIU (financial intelligence unit) with
adequate resources and establishing clear
cooperation mechanisms between the FIU and

ASFI should increase the intensity, frequency, and
coverage of supervision in financial institutions,
including formalizing the on-site inspection cycle.

Improve the operations of the credit bureaus.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Law 170 on terrorism financing was passed by
Parliament in September 2011 and decree on
sanctions (Decree 910) was issued. FIU has prepared a
strategy that includes four components: (i) Aligning
the law on terrorism financing with international
standards; (ii) increasing supervising power of FIU, (iii)
aligning the law with the Resolution 1373 of the UN
security council on freezing of assets; (iv) increasing
capacity of FIU and of the heads of financial
institutions on the issues related to AML/CFT through
training.
A draft new manual formalizing inspection and
supervision practice is ready for approval. ASFI is
working on a risk matrix, to increase supervision on
riskier entities. ASFI’s current on-site supervision is
annual with semi-annual stress testing; however,
flexibility has been increased to allow for more
frequent inspections if problems are detected.
New department in charge of Credit Bureau
supervision (Direction of Auxiliary Services) has been
created in ASFI in 2011. The department has begun to
inspect the credit bureaus and create a system to
strengthen information.

Microfinance
Promote partial credit guarantee schemes,
registries for movable assets.

ASFI is working on a new regulation to establish the
guarantees in terms of percentage of the capital of
the enterprise rather than in nominal terms.
Microcredit is currently guaranteed with nominal
limits of Bs. 84,000 and of Bs. 112,000 for productive
activities.

Carry out financial literacy and promotion
campaigns.

In 2011, ASFI and the Central Bank organized
enhanced public information campaigns on financial
services through seminars on TV and radio
advertisements. ASFI has also funded additional
agencies in rural areas.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

Approved By

Prepared By The Staff of the International Monetary Fund

Gilbert Terrier and Jan
Kees Martijn

Bolivia’s public debt sustainability has continued to improve as a result of fiscal surpluses.
Debt ratios continue to display ample margins with respect to risk thresholds and are
expected to decline further under the baseline scenario. Debt service is projected to
remain low, reflecting predominantly long maturities of remaining stocks of both
domestic and foreign debt. The path of debt ratios would deteriorate somewhat under
standard stress tests, but would remain within manageable bounds over the medium and
long run. Therefore, the risk of debt distress is assessed to be low.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS BOLIVIA

BACKGROUND
1.
Bolivia’s gross public debt (domestic
and external) has fallen significantly over the
last years, benefiting from MDRI and fiscal
surpluses. Between 2003 and 2011, gross debt
has fallen from 96 to 34 percent of GDP, while
external public debt has declined from 65 to 14
percent of GDP, with MDRI accounting for 2.9
billion dollars in 2006 and 2007.
2.
Bolivia’s changing debt structure and
the accumulation of significant public sector
deposits at the central bank have further
reduced debt vulnerabilities. Since 2005,
average maturities have been successfully
extended and foreign currency exposure has been
reduced. Moreover, with the accumulation of net

deposits of the non-financial public sector at the
Central Bank- amounting to about 20 percent of
GDP at present- the solvency of the non-financial
public sector measured by the net public debt
(i.e., gross debt minus net central bank credit) has
improved even more significantly: net debt has
declined from 88 percent in 2003 to 14 percent of
GDP in 2011. On account of declining gross debt,
debt ratios would reach very low levels during the
projection period. The average maturity of the
outstanding external public debt remains longer
than 20 years at year-end 2011 (with 64 percent
of the total debt concentrated between 11 to 30
years and 32 percent beyond 31 years). Effective
average interest rate of the total public debt was
about 3.5 percent at year end 2011.

BASELINE SCENARIO
3.
The main assumptions of the baseline
scenario for the period of 2012-2032 are:


Average annual real GDP growth: 5
percent until 2017 and 4.5 percent until
2032.



Inflation: 5.0 percent in 2012 and 4.0
percent between 2013 and 2032.



External sector: In line with the mediumterm staff projections (using the current
WEO baseline for commodity prices) and
the assumption of stable import and
export ratios to GDP over the long term.
Net FDI is assumed to remain broadly
stable in terms of GDP, mainly influenced
by the operations of foreign companies
operating in the natural resource sector.

2

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND



Fiscal assumptions: beyond 2017, the
NFPS is expected to run moderate primary
surpluses (an average of 0.4 percent of
GDP over 2018–32), with public investment
levels and current spending broadly stable.
CAF will remain as the largest external
lender. In line with recent developments,
until the distribution of revenues and
spending responsibilities among different
levels of government is redefined, the
central government will continue running a
deficit while sub-national governments will
continue to run surpluses and accumulate
deposits at the central bank.



Average concessionality of the public
external debt: is projected to be around
18 percent, in the medium term, based on
projected disbursements of official loans
and the concessional financing conditions

BOLIVIA

(grace period of about 7 years and interest
rates below market rates).
4.
Bolivia’s public and external debt is
expected to remain sustainable throughout
the projection period and the risk of debt
distress is low. Bolivia is classified as a strong
performer in terms of its policy and institutional
capacity, measured by the three-year average of
the World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional
Assessment (CPIA) scores. All the debt burden
indicators for Bolivia are well below the specific
indicative thresholds for strong performers.
Hence, Bolivia’s risk of debt distress is low- an

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

assessment that would hold even under
significant stress tests.1
5.
Under the baseline scenario, Bolivia’s
indebtedness and debt service levels would
remain well manageable. Specifically, the gross
non-financial sector public debt-to-GDP ratio -34
percent in 2011- is projected to decline gradually
to 29 percent by 2017, and to 15 percent in 2032.
The total stock of external debt (public and
private) was 18 percent of GDP in 2011 and is
projected to increase to 21 percent of GDP by
2017, and to stabilize at 15 percent of GDP by
2032. Consequently, Bolivia’s debt is expected to
be sustainable over the medium and long term.2

STRESS TEST
6.
Standard stress tests suggest that
Bolivia’s low public and external indebtedness
is resilient to a series of shocks. Under the most
extreme stress test to external debt, a one-time 30
percent nominal depreciation relative to the
baseline in 2013, the ratio of the NPV of debt to
GDP deteriorates somewhat and eventually
returns to a downward trajectory. In all cases, it
would remain well below risky levels. Flow
indicators also remain manageable under all stress
tests. For public debt, the biggest risk stems from
a onetime depreciation of the currency, however,
tests indicate that ratios remain within
manageable levels. Assuming an adverse scenario
where oil prices decline by 30 percent in 2012–17,
Bolivia’s non-interest current account would move
from a surplus of about 2.2 percent of GDP to a
deficitary position. This would mean that, with the
same levels of projected external debt, net
international reserves would remain broadly stable
and decline gradually in terms of GDP, to about 41
percent of GDP in 2017; this level is judged to be

still strong and external debt indicators would
remain below the thresholds.
7.
Bolivian authorities agree with the
assessment of low risk of debt distress. Staff
discussed the assumptions with the authorities, as
well as the strong dependence of the external and
fiscal positions on hydrocarbon revenues. The
authorities see upside risks to growth in the
medium-term and are confident that their policies
(i.e., industrialization of minerals and
hydrocarbons) will result in more stable external
and fiscal positions, making them less vulnerable
to terms of trade shocks.
1

Remittances in Bolivia represent about 4 percent of
GDP and 12 percent of exports. If we take remittances
into account there are no breaches of (modified)
thresholds under the baseline or stress tests in the
DSA; and inclusion of remittances does not cause a
change in the risk rating, which remains low.
2

The high levels of residuals in the external DSA are
explained by the accumulation of foreign exchange
reserves over the projection period, which is consistent
with the projected fiscal stance that would lead to
further accumulation of public sector deposits at the
central bank.

Safeguards Assessment: Under the Fund’s
safeguards assessment policy, the Central
Bank of Bolivia (CBB) was subject to an
assessment with respect to the April 2, 2003
Stand-by Arrangement (SBA). A safeguards
assessment was completed on June 27, 2003,
and while no systemic risks with the CBB’s
safeguards were identified, uncertainties were
expressed about the de facto lack of
operational independence and program
monetary data. An update assessment was
completed on September 27, 2004 in
conjunction with an augmentation of the SBA.
This assessment confirmed that measures had
been implemented to address all previously
identified vulnerabilities, except for those
requiring a change in the central bank law.
Currently, CBB is not subject to the policy.
Exchange Arrangement: The Bolivian
currency is the Boliviano and the de facto and
de jure exchange rate regimes are crawling
peg. Since November 2010, the authorities
resumed the negative crawling peg and the
official selling rate has appreciated from
Bs7.07 per U.S. dollar to Bs6.96.

The Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) provides 100 percent debt relief to eligible member countries that are qualified for
the assistance. The debt relief covers the full stock of debt owed to the Fund as of end-2004 which remains outstanding at the time
the member qualifies for such debt relief. The MDRI is financed by bilateral contributions and the Fund's own resources, as well as
the resources already disbursed to the member under the HIPC Initiative (see Section VII above).

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

ANNEX 2. RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK AND
BANK-FUND COLLABORATION UNDER THE JMAP
A. Relations with the World Bank
1.
The recently approved Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS) is guiding the
World Bank Group (WBG) support to
Bolivia for the fiscal period 2012-2015.
Following the implementation of two
consecutive Interim Strategy Notes (ISN), the
WBG has developed a four-year CPS around
the principles of alignment with Government
strategic priorities, selectivity, and coordination
with development partners. Also, a results
matrix will track program implementation and
its impact on country development goals. The
CPS was discussed by the Board in December
2011. It proposes a program of lending
operations and knowledge activities in four
results areas: (i) sustainable productive
development, (ii) climate change and disaster
risk management, (iii) human development
and access to basic services, and (iv) public
sector effectiveness. In addition, the strategy
incorporates gender and governance and anticorruption as cross-cutting themes. These
areas respond to Government requests and
priorities outlined in the National
Development Plan (NDP), and make the most
of the WBG´s comparative advantage.
2.
The CPS may involve a transition
from financing through the International
Development Association (IDA) to the
International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (IBRD). Up to the CPS midpoint
review, Bolivia would only access IDA
financing, for which an indicative lending
program has been agreed upon with the
Government for Special Drawing Rights (SDR)

110.5 million (approx. US$170 million). These
resources from the IDA16 cycle should be
committed in fiscal years 2012-2014. The CPS
proposes a frontloading of IDA resources in
fiscal years 2012 and 2013 to ensure continuity
of successful ongoing projects that close
during the first and second year of the CPS.
Since Bolivia´s Gross National Income (GNI)
per capita started to move decisively above
the IDA operational cut-off in 2006, the
Government submitted a formal request to
access IBRD lending. This request will be
formally assessed at the CPS midpoint review.
3.
The CPS will also support the
development of a flexible program of
Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAA)
and convening services tailored to the
Government´s needs. An indicative set of
non-lending activities has been defined for
fiscal year 2012, which includes technical
assistance and Economic and Sector Work
(ESW) in areas such as public sector
governance, multi-dimensional poverty and
poverty assessment, social safety nets, the
strengthening of environmental and natural
resource management, the Stolen Asset
Recovery (StAR) Initiative, and the Report on
the Observance of Standards and Codes
(ROSC) in Auditing and Accounting. The AAA
program will be kept open and flexible for the
other years to ensure that it can respond to
the requirements that emerge during the
implementation of the CPS. A package of
capacity building and knowledge activities
would be provided to prepare the country for

the potential transition to IBRD lending in
strategic areas such as public debt
management. Recently, the Bank delivered to
the Government core pieces of ESW related to
the financial sector, including the Financial
Sector Review and the Financial Sector
Assessment Program (FSAP) Update. The
financial sector notes followed a modular
approach to accommodate topics of interest
to the Government. Topics included the
transitioning of financial cooperatives into the
regulatory sphere, and comparing the
applicable regulatory framework with regional
standards. Another report in this series focuses
on outreach to rural areas and assessing the
financial sector´s potential role in fostering
productive sector credit. The Bank and the
Government are currently exploring possible
follow-up to implement some of the findings.
4.
The International Finance
Corporation (IFC) will continue supporting
Bolivia with a strategy that focuses on
viable, high-impact private sector-led
projects, complemented by strategic
advisory services. On the investment side, IFC
will maintain its focus on clients with
sustainable business models that have
demonstrated strong past performance and
operate efficiently within regulatory
frameworks mandated by Bolivia´s new
Constitution. This includes projects primarily in
financial markets, agribusiness and forestry,
but could also expand to other sectors should
a conducive environment be in place. On its
advisory work, IFC will continue its work to
improve the investment climate by simplifying
procedures at the municipal and possibly the

national level, and provide training to Small
and Medium Enterprises (SME) through its
business advisory pillar. If required, IFC could
provide further technical assistance and
capacity building in investment climate, access
to finance, and the strengthening of local
royalty management through strategic
community investment programs. In addition,
the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency
(MIGA) has received preliminary inquiries by
investors and will proceed once a strong
developmental case can be built.
5.
The CPS is supporting the smooth
implementation of the current portfolio.
New investment projects under preparation
will enter the portfolio in the short term. The
Bank´s existing portfolio comprises 13
investment projects for a total commitment of
US$444 million, of which US$330 million
remain undisbursed (Table 1). There has been
a slowdown in the execution of the portfolio
over the ongoing fiscal year, to a large extent
this is due to the recent change in the maturity
of the portfolio. Four projects for
US$239 million entered the portfolio in
calendar year 2011, these are just starting
implementation. In addition, three operations
and one additional financing are currently in
preparation under the umbrella of the CPS: the
Rural Alliances II Project (US$40 million), an
Additional Financing for the Urban
Infrastructure Project (US$24 million), the
Water and Sanitation Project (US$70 million),
and the Access to Renewable Energy (US$25
million). These operations are expected to be
approved in fiscal years 2012 and 2013.

B. IMF Relations with the World Bank Under JMAP
7.
The following priorities were identified
for the coordinated work-plan on Bolivia:


Strengthening of the fiscal framework,
in particular the reform of
intergovernmental relations, transparent
management of the hydrocarbon-related
revenue and reinforcement of the multiannual budget process. The public sector
has to strengthen capacity also on public
sector management and procurement.



Maintaining adequate financial sector
supervision. The financial sector is liquid
and solvent. The current challenge is to
gradually increase its depth, while
strengthening supervision to maintain the
health of the loan portfolios, and to fully
develop a financial sector safety net.



Improving the business climate to
bolster investment. Bolivia’s private
investment rate remains significantly below
the levels observed in the past decade and
well below the regional average. There is
also the challenge to reconcile the need to
maintain the role of the private sector with
the government intention to increase the
role of the state in the economy.



Reducing poverty. Significant challenges
remain in the area of human development,
including access to quality basic education
and health, employability of low income
youth and social protection network.

collaborating with the authorities in this
area.


Fiscal federalism. The Fund has been
providing TA on the fiscal implications of
the draft law on Administrative
Autonomies and Decentralization. Further,
the Bank is supporting the Ministry of
Development Planning in the
decentralization process and the public
investment management and coordination
among different levels of government.



Governance and budget framework. The
Bank, in collaboration with the Ministry of
Finance, and the IADB, delivered the Public
Expenditure Financial Assessment (PEFA).
The assessment provided the basis for the
Government to prioritize and measure
progress, and identified critical areas
where reforms might be needed. Following
the PEFA results, the Government designed
an action plan, which in its first stage is
focusing on enhancing revenue-generating
functions (customs and taxation offices). If
required, the Bank can support the
development of PFM assessments at the
sub-national level.



Social protection: The Bank will continue
assisting the Government in the area of
social protection, health and education.
The Bank has been also providing technical
assistance on poverty, to help both
diagnosis and targeting of population that
fails to reach minimum standards of
multidimensional welfare.



Private sector development: The World
Bank Group will continue its analytical
work and financing in the area of

ANNEX 3. RELATIONS WITH THE INTER-AMERICAN
DEVELOPMENT BANK
1.
As of December 31, 2011, the InterAmerican Development Bank (IDB) had
approved loans to Bolivia amounting to
US$4.66 billion, with disbursements totaling
US$3.62 billion. Bolivia’s outstanding debt to
the IDB was approximately US$764.0 million with
undisbursed approved funds for
US$668.4 million. During the year net cash flows
to the country were positive for a third year in a
row, a trend expected to continue in the base
scenario to 2016. At the end of 2007, the IDB
unilaterally joined the IMF-WB MDRI initiative,
by writing off a total of US$741.1 million in
principal payments and US$307.3 millions of
future interest payments, generating an
estimated annual fiscal space of more than
US$18.0 millions on average.

element under IDB’s blended financial
conditions. The new country strategy included
provisions and triggers for considering an
increase in the financial envelope through an
additional decrease in the concessional
component element to 20 percent. During 2011
Bolivia enjoyed an annual allocation of
US$252.00 millions for 2011, the base scenario
for the period 2011-2015 is the approval of new
loans US$252.0 million per year. At beginning of
2012 Bolivia and the IDB are in the process of
changing the blend conditions (20 percent of
concessional element), which will imply an
annual allocation of US$315.0 million for 2012.

2.
After the last round of debt relief, the
IDB has implemented a new criteria of
allocation of concessional lending which is
consistent with the application of the Debt
Sustainability Framework. The IDB lending to
Bolivia will follow the operational guidelines for
concessional funds under the Fund of Special
Operations (FSO) performance-based allocation
system. Parallel lending operations, modality
that blends ordinary and concessional funding,
will be the preferred lending instrument up to
2020.

4.
Under the Bank’s country strategy
with Bolivia, the government and the IDB
have agreed on making sustainable growth
and poverty-inequality reduction as main
objectives of their strategic engagement. In
pursuit of this objective, the Bank will align its
actions with those on Bolivia’s National
Development Plan. The country strategy will
target its interventions in the following sectors:
(i) Transport; (ii) Water and sanitation; (iii)
Energy; (iv) Early Childhood Development (ECD);
(v) Health; (vi) Education; and (vii) Institutional
and Sustainability Strengthening. As overarching
sectors, the IDB will focus on climate change and
indigenous population/diversity issues.

3.
The IDB and Bolivia have a new
country strategy covering the period 20112015. Under the new country strategy, the IDB
has decided to increase financial flows to Bolivia.
Beginning 2012, Bolivia, in the base scenario, will
be allocated 25 percent of the concessional

As of December 31, 2011 the portfolio
of executing sovereign guaranteed

executing portfolio supports mostly transport,

interventions. The undisbursed sovereign
portfolio is concentrated (56 percent) in the
above mentioned sectors. The non-sovereign
guaranteed executing portfolio consists of 2
loans ascending to US$7.1 million and 2 TFFP´s
ascending to US$13 million, of which none has
been disbursed. The Bank’s 2012 operative
program portfolio contains 7 sovereign
guaranteed loans for a total amount of US$252
million which will be concentrated in transport,
water and sanitation, early childhood
development, education, health and
strengthening of public governance, and 3 nonsovereign guaranteed for a total amount of US$
14 million. Seven additional loans for US$252
million have been identified for the pipeline
2013.

6.
The conditions for the strategy’s
implementation remain complex, with
important institutional, social and political
definitions yet to be clarified thus
representing direct and indirect risks to the
fulfillment of the strategy objectives. In the
new country strategy several macroeconomics,
institutional and regulatory risks are identify to
pose direct and indirect challenges to the
implementation scenarios of the Bank’s strategic
engagement. Particularly relevant for the new
country strategy are the financial implications of
the country’s excessive dependence on oil
revenues; the weak policy implementation and
institutional capacity affecting the public
investments programs; and the problematic
regulatory environment that keeps downgrading
the investment climate of the country.

ANNEX 4. STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of April 30, 2012)

A. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some
shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for
surveillance.
National Accounts: The National Institute
of Statistics (INE) is revising the national
accounts statistics, including the updating of
the base year (currently dating from 1990)
and an intensified implementation of the
System of National Accounts 1993
(SNA 1993).
Labor market: The quality of the household
and employment surveys has declined in the
last few years, due mainly to financial
constraints. The quarterly employment
survey was discontinued in 2003, leading to
a lack of quarterly information on
unemployment, employment and wages.
Yearly information on wages is still compiled
by INE.
Prices statistics: Industrial producer price
indices and external trade unit values are
compiled by INE, but are in need of revision
as regards concepts and definitions

consistent with SNA 1993, as well as
treatment of seasonal products, missing
items, quality changes, and introduction of
new products.
Government finance statistics: Annual
data on the operations of the consolidated
central government do not cover all
operations of decentralized agencies and
operations channeled through special funds.
The ongoing implementation of a
comprehensive financial management
system, with funding from the IADB/WB, will
help ensure proper monitoring of public
sector financial operations including
subnational fiscal operations, debt and
social spending. It will also be important to
improve on the reporting of the operations
and debt of public enterprises.
Balance of payments: The coverage of
certain services and financial transactions in
the balance of payments has been
expanded, following recommendations by
the January 2007 Data ROSC mission.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
June 7, 2012

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation
with Bolivia
On June 1, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV Consultation1 with Bolivia on a lapse-of-time basis.2
Background
Well-balanced macroeconomic policies, accompanied by an improvement in terms of trade
during recent years, have allowed Bolivia to achieve very positive macro-economic results.
Exports of goods tripled since 2005, thanks to increased volumes of gas, mineral, and
agricultural exports, and the concurrent boom in commodity prices. Real GDP growth, which
averaged 3.3 percent annually during 1996–2005, increased to an average of 4.7 percent in
2006–11. The external and fiscal positions strengthened sharply, as larger export receipts,
higher taxation of hydrocarbon production, and moderate rates of increase in government
spending, led to substantial external current account and fiscal surpluses. These surpluses
contributed to the build-up of a comfortable reserves buffer, now at 50 percent of GDP.
In 2011, economic activity remained robust amid strong domestic demand growth, with real
GDP growing by 5.2 percent. After a sharp increase at the beginning of 2011, 12-month inflation
has gradually declined to 4 percent in March 2012, reflecting a softening in international food
prices, price-stabilization policies in agriculture, and a gradual re-anchoring of expectations.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares
a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the
Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this
summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can
be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.
2

The Executive Board takes decisions under its lapse-of-time procedure when the Board agrees that a
proposal can be considered without convening formal discussions.

2
Domestic demand grew briskly, with imports climbing over 40 percent with respect to 2010. As a
result, the external current account balance narrowed to 2¼ percent of GDP, despite recordhigh export prices. Private investment has remained subdued, amid lingering uncertainty about
the legal framework.
Economic policies have been accommodative. In early 2011, the central bank tightened
monetary conditions in response to the pickup in inflation. However, since mid-2011 and in the
face of renewed external uncertainty, the central bank reduced the pace of liquidity withdrawal,
allowing for a resurgence of excess liquidity in the banking sector. At the same time, banks
continued to expand credit to the private sector, at above 20 percent in nominal terms. The
central bank let the currency appreciate only slightly, by 1.3 percent. The overall balance of the
public sector registered a surplus of 0.8 percent of GDP in 2011, as revenue performance
improved. Public investment picked up strongly, contributing to a fiscal impulse of about
1 percent of GDP.
Strong results have also been achieved on improving social inclusion and income distribution
through cash transfer programs and investment in infrastructure. The shareof the population
living under extreme poverty has halved between 2005 and 2011, from 48.5 percent to24.3
percent. At the same time, social and regional disputes have persisted, particularly in border
conflicts and in the context of revenue-sharing arrangements, and location of infrastructure.
Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the 2012 Article IV consultation with Bolivia, Executive Directors endorsed the
staff’s appraisal, as follows:
The Bolivian economy maintained a strong performance in 2011. Real GDP growth accelerated,
on the back of strong terms-of-trade and accommodative policies. Strong demand growth led to
a narrowing of the external current account surplus and, despite buoyant revenue, the fiscal
surplus declined due to fiscal impulse. Net international reserves climbed to new highs, thus
offering strong protection to external shocks. Bank credit continued to expand at rapid rates,
amid strong financial soundness indicators.
The outlook for 2012 is favorable and short term downside risks are manageable. Real GDP is
expected to continue growing at a fast pace, reflecting still high terms of trade and mildly
expansionary policies. The external current account and the fiscal balance are expected to
remain in surplus. Downside risks from an adverse external environment are limited by strong
financial cushions and proven resilience of the Bolivian economy to financial shocks.
A shift in macroeconomic policies to a more neutral level might be required to consolidate the
decline in inflation and reduce overheating risk. The envisaged fiscal impulse is modest, but a

3
higher fiscal balance would help offset strong private demand growth. The central bank may
want to absorb part of the large excess liquidity in the banking sector with a view to slowing
credit growth and seeking a gradual increase in short-term and deposit interest rates.
Given the outlook for commodity prices, projected fiscal spending for 2012 is compatible with a
sustainable fiscal position over the medium term. Under current policies, public debt will remain
on a downward path over the next few years, as the nonfinancial public sector is expected to
run modest surpluses.
To protect public investment and make room for higher social spending, a strengthening of the
non-hydrocarbon balance is recommended. Increasing productive and social investment—while
containing current expenditure—would require either higher revenue or reducing other
spending. Reducing fuel subsidies, with appropriate compensatory measures, and
strengthening direct taxation would help to make space for these additional outlays.
Reforms to the policy framework, building on the authorities’ plans, will help improve policy
responses to changing economic conditions. Setting up a medium-term fiscal framework for the
exploitation of natural resources would help avoid pro-cyclical fiscal spending and build buffers
to insure against commodity price volatility. It will also help introduce intergenerational equity
considerations in the design of fiscal policy, as natural resource depletion is balanced against
strong development needs.
Limiting the role of the central bank in financing public investment would help reinforce the
strength of monetary policy. In line with international experience, central bank financing for
development purposes should be limited, to avoid the emergence of quasi-fiscal losses,
especially under adverse external scenarios. As lower dollarization becomes more entrenched
and domestic financial markets develop further, the authorities will have room to move toward
greater exchange rate flexibility.
The expansion of public sector involvement in productive activities and investment should be
accompanied by a stronger governance and accountability framework. A strategy
encompassing all public corporations, as planned with the enactment of a new law for Public
Enterprises, is needed. Elements of the legal framework should include a requirement that
financial statements be externally audited; that the cost of quasi-fiscal operations be disclosed;
and that reports be elaborated on the performance of companies and the risks they face. In
tandem, there is a need to step up efforts to ensure the effectiveness of public spending and
enhance implementation capacity across all levels of government.
Building on important improvements in the financial sector, further strengthening is needed to
ensure macro-financial stability. Financial sector indicators are strong, but credit expansion
needs to be monitored closely and banking sector buffers maintained. Staff welcomes the

4
progress in the adoption of FSAP recommendations. Plans to strengthen the financial system
safety net, with the introduction of a limited deposit insurance, should help consolidate the
strength of the banking sector. In addition, direct controls on the price and allocation of credit
should be avoided. To preserve Bolivia’s financial system integrity, the Anti Money Laundering/
Combating the Financing of Terrorism regime should be rapidly strengthened to comply with
international norms.
Sustaining high and stable medium-term growth will require improvements in the business
environment. A key challenge will be to adapt the legal framework for natural resources and
private investment to the mandates of the Constitution in a way that ensures clear and stable
rules of the game for the private sector. Clearly defining the scope of public sector operations
while ensuring a fair and swift process of compensation of the former owners of nationalized
companies would also contribute to reducing risk perceptions.
Progress in social policies has allowed Bolivia to make inroads toward achieving its Millennium
Development Goals. Maintaining the real value of cash-transfer programs to preserve their
impact and enhancing the delivery of education and health services are priorities. Appropriate
incorporation of these needs in the budgetary process will be important in the period ahead.
