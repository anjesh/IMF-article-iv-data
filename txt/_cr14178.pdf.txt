STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
May 30, 2014

KEY ISSUES
Outlook and Risks: Growth in Bhutan was robust during the last Five-Year Plan (2008/09
to 2012/13), driven by the development of the hydropower sector. However, growth has
slowed recently due to policy efforts to moderate aggregate demand to ameliorate
overheating pressures. Downside risks remain due to high public debt, potential financial
sector vulnerabilities, and the need to manage recurrent pressures on Indian rupee
reserves. The main external vulnerability stems from a prolongation of the slowdown in
India, Bhutan’s main trade and development partner.
Main Policy Recommendations: The main near-term policy challenge is to revive
growth while ensuring that external pressures do not reemerge. The key policy
recommendations are:
 Fiscal policy should be tightened while preserving social and productive expenditure.
Revenue reforms, including broadening the tax base by reducing the number of zerosales tax-rated goods and taxing domestic value added more extensively, would help in
the near term. Over the medium term, consideration should be given to introducing a
value-added tax.
 On monetary policy, external flows should be fully sterilized and liquidity should be
tightened to prevent credit growth from rebounding too strongly. Interest rate spreads
need to be narrowed and better reflect market conditions. Over the medium-term, there
is a need to further improve the monetary transmission mechanism and deepen the
financial system. In particular, it is essential to further develop the government bond
market by greater and more regular issuance.
 Reserves have to be managed carefully to contain recurrent pressures on rupee
reserves, including by aligning the currency composition of reserves with that of the
structure of external liabilities and trade.
 Further financial deepening should be balanced with maintaining financial stability.
Risks to stability necessitate continued vigilance, given past rapid private credit growth.
Supervision and regulation need to be strengthened to monitor and safeguard banks’
asset quality and limit systemic risk, including by use of macroprudential measures.

poverty, along with marked
improvement in social
indicators. Bhutan has attained or is on track to achieve most of the MDGs. Additionally, Bhutan has
pioneered a unique development approach based on the concept of Gross National Happiness (Box
1). Bhutan has also enjoyed political stability, with elections and a smooth political transition taking
place in mid 2013.
2.
Notwithstanding these successes, Bhutan faces growing external imbalances. Rapid
growthwas accompanied by overheating pressures which resulted in a sharp widening of the current
account deficit, in part due to substantial hydro-power related imports. External pressures have led
to a recurrent shortfall in Indian rupee reserves. A comprehensive set of policies should be put in
place to ensure that such pressures are minimized in future as Bhutan continues on its quest to raise
growth and living standards through expansion of hydropower capacity.
3.
The authorities’ macroeconomic policies and past Fund advice have been broadly
aligned, but progress on fiscal consolidation and structural reforms have been slow. Consistent
with Fund advice, important steps have been taken to improve the monetary transmission
mechanism, to introduce macroprudential rules, and to actively manage reserves. However, the
stance of fiscal policy has been looser than staff recommended in 2011 Article IV Consultation and is
budgeted to remain high in FY2014. Also, progress on structural reforms has been limited.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
4.
GDP growth in Bhutan has been strong over the Tenth FYP, driven by the hydropower
sector. However, growth is projected to have slowed to 5 percent in FY 20131 from over 10 percent
in FY2011, due to policy efforts to moderate credit growth to contain overheating pressures.

Restrictions on credit for construction and vehicle imports led to a decline in services sector growth,
particularly in transport and financial services, as well as a decline in construction sector growth.
5.
Inflation remains elevated above double digits, mostly reflecting price developments in
India, given the peg to the Indian rupee2. Headline inflation reached 11.3 percent in December
2013, accelerating from 9.5 percent in December 2012. Inflation is projected to average above
10 percent in FY 2014, but should decline over the medium term in line with moderation in India’s
inflation. Staff analysis has found that inflation in Bhutan is closely related to Indian inflation (see Box
2).
6.
The current account (CA) deficit remains sizable and is financed through substantial aid
inflows. The CA deficit, reflecting large hydropower-related imports, widened to 22.8 percent of GDP
in FY 2013 from 15 percent of GDP on average over the 10th FYP. In addition, hydro-related auxiliary
activities and a consumption and housing boom added to the rapid increase in non-hydropower
imports. Nonetheless, robust aid inflows have led to a positive overall balance of payments position,
enabling the continued accumulation of international reserves, which stood at US$ 933 million (over
10 months of import cover) in December 2013.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
7.
Growth momentum is expected to pick up in the near term. Growth is projected to
recover to 6½ percent in FY2014, rising to about 7½ percent in FY2015, driven mainly by a pick-up in
hydropower-related construction and domestic services. In addition, policy measures to revive the
economy, including a capital infusion in banks as part of an Economic Stimulus Package (ESP), are
likely to exert a modest positive impact on growth. The CA deficit is projected to widen further to
around 25 percent in FY 2014 due to stronger hydro-related imports.
8.
The expansion of hydropower capacity over the medium-term poses challenges for
macroeconomic management (see Box 3). Growth is projected to average 8½ percent over the
course of the Eleventh FYP, boosted initially by the construction of hydropower facilities and then by
electricity generation in later years. As a result, the CA deficit is projected to widen to more than
27 percent of GDP by FY2017. External financing should be monitored closely so that pressures on
the overall balance of payments position remain contained. However, if this transition is well
managed, per-capita incomes could double to around US$5,000 by FY2019.
9.
Risks are firmly tilted to the downside. Risks stem from high debt levels and the possible
surfacing of financial sector vulnerabilities following a prolonged period of rapid credit growth. There
is also a risk of renewed external pressures, including pressures on rupee reserves, if macroeconomic
policies remain expansionary and credit growth rebounds strongly. Additionally, risks emanate from
a potential slower-than-expected recovery in India—including due to financial market volatility—

though these risks are mitigated by the concentration of exports in the hydropower sector, which
enjoys healthy demand from power-constrained India (see Box 4 for spillovers from India)3.

POLICY THEME #1––MAINTAINING MACROECONOMIC STABILITY
The near-term challenge is to support growth while ensuring that macroeconomic stability is
maintained and external pressures remain contained. Fiscal and monetary policies should be tightened
and reserve management strengthened in the face of recurrent pressures on rupee reserves.

A. Fiscal Policy
Background
10.
The fiscal deficit worsened sharply in FY2013 due to a shortfall in grants, and is
budgeted to remain high in FY2014. The FY2013 fiscal deficit was revised to 4 percent of GDP,
compared with the previous estimate of 1 percent, driven primarily by a shortfall in grants. The
budget for FY2014 aims for a deficit of 3.6 percent, mainly on account of lower projected revenues
and grants. In addition, an off-budget economic stimulus plan, financed by official grants from India,
has been prepared in the amount of ngultrum 5 billion (about 4 percent of GDP) to be spent over 5
years, of which ngultrum 4 billion will be provided to banks in the form of subordinated debt and
revolving funds to reinvigorate credit growth. Furthermore, the stimulus plan proposes subsidies of
ngultrum 1 billion for education, free electricity, financial support for senior citizens, and
unemployment benefits.
11.
Over the medium term (corresponding to the Eleventh FYP), donor financing is
projected to fall as per capita incomes rise. Accordingly, grants are expected to decline from
9 percent of GDP in 2012/13 to 6 percent by 2017/18. The impact of declining grants is expected to
be mitigated by the increase in hydropower revenues as major projects currently under construction
come on-stream in the outer years of the plan. The fiscal deficit is projected to be around 1 percent
of GDP (on average) during the plan period4. The programs and financing of the Eleventh FYP were
negotiated with the Government of India, which will provide Nu. 45 billion (or 21 percent of plan
outlay) in the form of grants.

For a discussion of risks to India’s economic outlook, see India: 2014 Article IV Consultation (IMF Country Report No.
14/57).

4

The authorities’ fiscal anchor in the past has restricted current expenditure to domestic revenues, and has been
tightened to include part of capital expenditure in the FY2014 Budget. By the end of the medium term, the aim is to
cover an increasing share of expenditure from domestic revenues.

6

Staff Views
12.
In the near term, fiscal policy should aim for consolidation to ensure that overheating
pressures do not reemerge. Fiscal policy has generally been prudent in the past, but more recently,
the fiscal stance has turned much more expansionary. Persistent large deficits, financed by domestic
borrowing, risk crowding out the private sector and contributing to a buildup of public debt.
Revenue reforms are essential, including reducing the number of zero-rated goods, simplifying the
indirect tax rate structure, widening taxation of domestic activity, and improving tax administration
(see Selected Issues Paper on “Options for Tax Reform”). Such reforms will reduce dependence on
hydropower and on external aid, and will ameliorate revenue volatility. In addition, if there are further
grant shortfalls, restraining spending while preserving social and productivity-enhancing expenditure
will be appropriate. Further civil service wage hikes, unaccompanied by complementary revenue
measures, would lead to deterioration of fiscal balances5. As well, the ESP risks stoking overheating
pressures which could translate into external pressures.
12.
Over the medium term, reforms should aim to place public finances on a more solid
footing. As noted, over the span of the Eleventh FYP, donor financing is projected to fall as incomes
rise. Caution is needed in the event of further delays in grant inflows and in the commissioning of the
ongoing hydropower projects (which would lead to large revenue shortfalls in the outer years of
plan). Given such potential eventualities, spending restraint and prioritization would be prudent to
create the fiscal space for necessary development-related expenditure (on health and education)
while avoiding a build-up of public debt. Consideration should be given to introducing a valueadded tax to replace the existing system of indirect taxes, to boost revenue collection through a
wider base and better enforcement.

13.
There is a need to improve fiscal management, including strengthening cash
management (on which Fund TA is being provided). Government cash balances are prone to sharp
fluctuations due to erratic and volatile inflows, particularly grants, necessitating the maintenance of
large precautionary balances. Moreover, domestic financial markets are shallow and underdeveloped,
and treasury bills are not issued regularly enough to handle fiscal volatility. Thus, cash flow is both
complicated to forecast and difficult to smooth with existing instruments. The issuance of treasury
bills should be planned and based on a cash forecasting framework, as opposed to ad-hoc shortterm borrowing. Over the medium term, the multi-year budget framework could be enhanced to
enable the government to better mobilize donor support, along with coordinated development of a
treasury bill market to both facilitate issuance and develop demand for treasury bills.
Authorities’ Views
14.
The authorities broadly agreed with the need to maintain fiscal restraint, including
through additional revenue-raising measures. The next Budget is expected to include a number of
near-term tax measures to boost revenues, and a broader review of tax policy is envisaged in the
medium term. Fiscal measures will also likely replace administrative measures restricting imports of
vehicles and construction-related items. The authorities also recognized that fiscal room to
implement pay hikes is limited, even as expectations of a pay hike have arisen with the appointment
of the Pay Commission.
15.
On the larger-than-expected fiscal deficit in FY2013, the authorities noted that larger
domestic borrowing resulted from cash management needs as grants were delayed. They
clarified that the ESP will be implemented to minimize risks to banks and the possible generation of
excess aggregate demand. They clarified that banks will only serve as a conduit for financing, and will
be free to advance loans on purely commercial basis as long as the loans meet the criteria of import
substitution, export promotion, or employment promotion.

B. Monetary Policy
Background
16.
The tight liquidity condition faced by the banking system in 2011 and 2012 have eased
recently. Excess bank liquidity characterized the financial system from 2008 to early-2011 due to the
accumulation of hydropower and non-hydro inflows (which were only partially sterilized). Tight
liquidity conditions emerged in June 2011 (shortfall of Nu 1.1 bn or 1.5 percent of GDP) as a result of
persistent growth in rupee imports with an equivalent drain on local currency liquidity; a reduction in
retail deposits; over-dependence on more volatile and seasonal corporate and government deposits
as a source of funding; and bank financing of large investment projects (e.g. Dungsam cement
project). Responding to tight liquidity conditions, the Royal Monetary Authority (RMA) cut the cash
reserve ratio (CRR) twice, banned construction and vehicle loans, relaxed the provisioning
requirements, and suspended overnight sweeping of government accounts from the banks to the
RMA, which eased liquidity. At present, banking sector liquidity is ample at around 10 percent of
GDP .
8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BHUTAN

17.
The authorities have made some progress towards improving the monetary
transmission mechanism. In March 2012, the RMA introduced a Short-Term Liquidity Adjustment
Window (RSTLAW) for securitized RMA lending to banks at a newly-introduced policy rate which is
linked to the RSTLAW facility. To further strengthen the transmission mechanism, a base rate system
(below which lending is not viable for financial institutions) was introduced in order to influence
credit growth, increase transparency of loan pricing, and foster lending discipline. The base rate
could also serve as a reference benchmark for floating-rate loans. There remains a persistent
negative interest rate differential with India.

Despite substantial financing requirements
recently, the government has continued to rely on
bank financing rather than Treasury bill issuance.
First, the Ways and Means (W&M) account is available
at the RMA up to a limit of 10 percent of average
revenues over the last two years. Second, the
overdraft facility with the largest commercial bank
could be overdrawn without limit. As shown in the
text figure, the government first utilizes the cheaper
W&M account before making use of the overdraft.
The issuance of Treasury bills (T-bills) has to a large
extent been detached from financing requirements.
Since December 2009, T- bills have rarely been issued
for monetary policy purposes, nor are they being
issued at market-determined interest rates. Since
February 2013, the interest rate has been fixed at about
3 percent which is far below deposit rates and the
policy rate.

Bhutan: Government Borrowing from the Banking
System

Staff Views
19.
Monetary conditions should be tightened to ward off prospective overheating and
better manage pressures on rupee reserves. Liquidity conditions should be closely monitored and
promptly adjusted to prevent excessive credit growth in future. Specifically, the CRR should be
adjusted upward, and with further market development, regular and increased issuance of T-bills
should be used to mop up excess liquidity. Hydropower-related inflows and aid flows should be fully
sterilized to dampen inflation pressures and credit growth, thereby obviating the need for import
compression. Tighter macropolicy stances should also help to address competitiveness concerns.
20.
Despite progress, considerable enhancements to the monetary transmission
mechanism are needed. Interest rates need to be higher and be more closely aligned with those
prevailing in India. Notwithstanding the introduction of a new policy rate (which is not yet
operationally effective), the framework for monetary operations is underdeveloped, constrained by
the limited range of government securities and the lack of money and securities markets. Over the
medium term, the development of a formal interbank market and increased and regular issuance of
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

9

BHUTAN

T-bills and bonds are the most critical elements for making monetary policy more effective, for
enhancing financial markets, for improving banking system health, and for ensuring overall macro
financial stability. While it would entail some costs, introduction of a well-functioning government
securities market is critical, and would provide a risk-free benchmark for the financial system (and
eventually a yield curve), an investment vehicle for financial institutions, and a tool for open market
operations.
Authorities’ Views
21.
The authorities agreed on the need to monitor bank liquidity and credit conditions
more closely. They acknowledged that external flows should be fully sterilized and that the use of
current tools (including the overnight sweeping facility) are insufficient, and are therefore exploring
other instruments to manage liquidity. They noted that while credit growth has been reduced, such
administrative restrictions are not optimal and will be rolled back once the macroeconomic policy
stance is sufficiently tight.

C. External Sector Issues
Background
22.
The large current account deficit and the currency composition of reserves have
contributed to a recurring shortfall of Indian rupees. Convertible currency reserves are much
larger than rupee reserves, which have constituted less than 3 percent of reserves on average during
the past 5 years. Rapid credit growth, which led to higher non-hydropower imports, as well as large
hydropower-related imports resulted in strong demand for rupees. These pressures culminated in
pronounced rupee shortages and prompted two reserves sales of US$200 million each by the RMA in
December 2011 and June 2013.6 The RMA also utilized foreign exchange overdrafts with Indian
commercial banks and the line of credit with the Government of India. Additionally, a bilateral swap
agreement of US$100 million with the Reserve Bank of India was agreed upon in March 2013 and
was subsequently used (though it was reversed in September 2013). While these financing
instruments helped to relieve immediate reserve pressures, they are expensive and cannot address
the ongoing structural need to mobilize rupee reserves.
Staff Views
23.
The exchange rate peg with India has served Bhutan well, though the real effective
exchange rate is assessed to be above levels suggested by underlying fundamentals. The peg
to the Indian rupee remains appropriate and provides Bhutan with an appropriate nominal anchor,
given that India is Bhutan’s largest trade and development partner. The ngultrum is currently
6

Continued rupee shortages led to the adoption of a number of measures— including the restriction on the
availability of Indian rupee for making payments for imports of vehicles and construction material from India— in
March 2012.

BHUTAN

assessed to be overvalued by between 8–21 percent, though once additional hydropower revenues
materialize over the medium term, this overvaluation is projected to dissipate (see Box 5). Bhutan has
also ample reserves, as its reserve cover exceeds the standard measures of reserve adequacy and is
much higher than peer countries7.
24.
Notwithstanding an adequate level of reserves, they have to be managed carefully to
contain recurrent pressures. Risks stem from the fact that hydropower-related rupee debt service
payments are lumpy and there are timing mis-matches between hydropower-related rupee inflows
and outflows. These features require careful management and provisioning in advance for necessary
rupees. Also, the currency composition of reserves should be more closely aligned with the structure
of Bhutan’s external liabilities and trade (sources of rupee-currency liquidity needs)8. As noted in the
2013 IMF technical assistance on reserve management, consideration should be given to gradually
increasing the share of rupee reserves and to adopting reserve management and investment
guidelines. Furthermore, once the policy stance is tightened sufficiently and revenue reforms
instituted, the import restrictions should be gradually withdrawn, in line with the authorities’ plans.
25.
External debt is projected to rise significantly over the medium term. Bhutan’s debt
dynamics are subject to moderate risk of distress, as indicated by the Low-Income Country (LIC)Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA)—see Supplement I. The construction of new hydropower projects
is expected to lead to a substantial build-up of external debt, relative to levels projected during the
previous 2011 Article IV consultation. In particular, the LIC-DSA thresholds are breached for several
indicators for prolonged periods of time. However, these additional projects are expected to confer
strong future economic dividends, boosting future GDP growth and exports. The mitigating factors
that were highlighted in the previous DSA remain valid, namely a strong track record of project
implementation, commercial viability, and close economic and political ties with India, Bhutan’s main
provider of financing for hydropower projects and the key consumer of its electricity exports.
Notwithstanding these mitigating factors, additional non-concessional borrowing should be avoided
as the level of debt has increased substantially compared to previous DSAs.
26.
Recent changes to Bhutan’s foreign exchange framework, including the regulatory
responses to the Indian rupee shortage, have given rise to new exchange restrictions subject
to Fund approval under Article VIII, Section 2(a). These include: (i) banning residents who do not
comply with the requirement to repatriate export proceeds from accessing foreign exchange for
unrelated imports; (ii) requiring foreign direct investment businesses to pay for their establishment
and operational expenses from their own convertible currency resources; (iii) requiring Bhutanese
companies to pay the interest on and amortization of external loans from their own convertible
currency resources; (iv) restricting the availability of Indian rupees for making payments and transfers

Rupee debt constitutes 61 percent of total external debt in Bhutan, with convertible currency debt accounting for
29 percent. India is the largest trading partner for Bhutan (about 80 percent of Bhutan’s commodity exports are
destined for India and about 70 percent of Bhutan’s imports are from India).

to India in the following current international transactions: personal travel, study-abroad living
arrangement, family and salary remittances, advance payments for import from India and to recruit
Indian workers, and imports of certain construction materials and vehicles from India; and (v)
banning the access to Indian rupees for unrelated current international transactions for those who
contravene the RMA’s 2012 guidelines on Indian rupee transactions. The authorities should eliminate
the restrictions upon establishing the necessary macroeconomic and structural conditions.
Authorities’ Views
27.
The authorities noted that while Bhutan’s reserves exceed most standard reserve
adequacy thresholds, reserves have been largely built up through aid flows and not through
export earnings. The RMA, with technical assistance from the Fund, has revised its Reserve
Management Policy (RMP) and is drafting Investment Guidelines. In line with the new RMP, the RMA
has developed a reserve adequacy framework with a threshold based on essential imports and other
payments, beyond which the RMA shall convert its convertible currency reserves and increase rupee
reserves to meet external obligations. Nevertheless, the authorities noted that since the Indian rupee
is not a convertible currency, the RMA will need to calibrate its reserve composition between
convertible currencies and rupees cautiously. Also, they underscored that any conversion of
convertible currencies to rupees should take into account the Bhutanese Constitutional requirement
that the RMA hold 12 months of essential imports cover, as well as third country imports and debt
servicing requirements. The authorities considered the maintenance of most exchange restrictions
under Article XIV, and those inconsistent with the Article VIII obligations, as necessary given that
Bhutan’s reserves are built on aid and external borrowing, and the continuing pressure on Bhutan’s

SECTOR STABILITY AND FOSTERING DEEPENING
Vigilance on the risks to financial stability is warranted, against the backdrop of rapid credit
growth for a number of years. Supervision needs to be strengthened to safeguard asset quality.
Over the medium term, further financial deepening will require a comprehensive financial sector
strategy that balances the twin objectives of development and financial stability.9

Growth in bank credit to the private sector has been rapid, though it has decelerated
recently. Private sector credit grew at an average annual rate of 30 percent during 2002–11,
increasing credit from 11 to 47 percent of GDP. This

financial institutions have also engaged in lending.
Responding to the shortage of rupees, administrative measures (banning housing and vehicle loans)
to slow down credit have resulted in growth of private credit decelerating to 7.4 percent year-onyear in November 2013 and the credit-to-GDP ratio falling to 43 percent in 2013.

Financial sector vulnerabilities arise from growing asset-liability mismatches and
concentrated lending. A significant proportion of the deposit base is corporate deposits, which
tend to be short-term, seasonal, and volatile, whereas bank credit is concentrated in loans with
longer time horizons. The concentration of lending in personal and real estate loans raises particular

Financial stability indicators are generally
sound, though NPLs have increased recently. For the
system as a whole, the Capital Adequacy Ratio remained
high (at 18 percent in September 2013), though there is
considerable variation across banks. The Statutory Liquidity
Requirement (SLR) was also comfortably met at 36 percent
in September 2013 (compared with the regulatory
minimum of 20 percent), though the SLR includes
unsecured longer-term bank deposits with other banks and
non-banks, which heightens systemic risk (see chart).
Reflecting the economic slowdown, there has been a
deterioration in banks’ asset quality, with non-performing
loans (NPLs) rising from 8 percent in June 2012 to
12 percent in September 2013. Some sectors are seeing a
much sharper increase in NPLs, in particular trade and
commerce and personal loans. The bank credit-to-deposit
ratio has eased somewhat to 86 percent in September 2013
from over 105 percent in June 2012, as credit has been
curtailed.

concerns. More than a quarter of the financial sector’s portfolio consists of building and construction
loans, followed by personal loans which constitute around 16 percent of credit outstanding. The
prolonged credit boom has been associated with a run-up in real estate prices, and their recent
decline may expose weaknesses in asset quality. Stress tests indicate that the banking system would
be hardest hit under scenarios involving (i) a large increase in NPLs, which will reduce the banking
system’s CAR by 7 percentage points, and (ii) a souring of large exposures which has a particularly
sizeable impact on one of the large state owned banks and the private bank with the most significant
large exposures (for details please see EFSS supplement).

Notwithstanding progress, financial sector regulation and supervision need to be
strengthened. It is important to monitor vulnerabilities that may have accumulated in the wake of
sustained rapid credit growth for a number of years, including sectorally-concentrated lending,
asset-liability mismatches, the recent fall in asset values, and increased lending by non-banks.
Measures to strengthen regulation and supervision should include closing gaps in regulation, regular
stress-testing by the RMA to monitor risks, encouraging banks to conduct their own stress tests, and
putting in place crisis management and deposit insurance arrangements.
32.
Macroprudential policies should play an active role in containing the buildup of
financial sector risks. The RMA should continue to use macroprudential policies but reduce its
reliance on a single tool, namely the adjustment of risk weightings, and should undertake a regular
review of sector-wide risks. The authorities’ plans to further contain risks by using additional
macroprudential tools—including credit-to-deposit, loan-to-value, and debt-to-income limits—are
welcome. However, care needs to be taken to sequence these measures appropriately and to provide
financial institutions with sufficient time to comply. Instituting investment guidelines for non-banks
would be a welcome step, however requirements to limit lending activities should be complemented
by measures to enhance investment opportunities (such as encouraging the development of longdated government securities).

33.
Efforts to deepen the financial sector should continue, along with initiatives to make it
more inclusive. The preparation of a comprehensive Financial Sector Development Strategy (now
under way with World Bank assistance) will provide a careful sequencing of reforms within a
medium-term plan. As well, promoting alternatives to bank financing for the private sector, including
developing the commercial bond market and private equity markets over the medium term, would
be welcome. Floating minority shares of public enterprises would broaden the range of investment
opportunities. Efforts to promote financial literacy are valuable and should continue.
Authorities’ Views
34.
The authorities highlighted that they are closely monitoring financial sector risks and
are planning regular bank stress testing. They acknowledged that short-term deposits dominate
the banks’ funding base, and hence, there are asset-liability mismatches. They recognized the need
to use varied macroprudential policies and instruments and plan to roll out measures gradually in
the coming months to deal with the significant build up in financial sector liquidity, asset-liability
mismatches and other sector-wide risks and vulnerabilities. They agreed that further engaging the
banks by conducting periodic stress tests would allow for a better understanding of risks.

POLICY THEME #3–– DIVERSIFYING THE SOURCES OF
GROWTH AND ENHANCING INCLUSIVENESS
The key medium-term challenge is to diversify the economy to make growth more sustainable
and less volatile, while also reducing the reliance on hydropower. Greater private sector
development and job creation would also pave the way for more sustainable and inclusive growth.

It is estimated that diversification episodes are associated with a 17 percent reduction in output growth volatility;
among LICs, the reduction in volatility is as high as 40 percent. The evidence also suggests that diversification
episodes and growth accelerations are correlated. See “Economic Diversification in LICs: Stylized Facts and
Macroeconomic Implications”, IMF Staff Discussion Note SDN 12/13.

The development of new sectors, export diversification and job creation are central
goals of government policy. The government’s Economic Development Policy, as represented in
various Five Year Plans and its “Vision 2020” statement, underscore the importance of leveraging
hydropower development to achieve broad-based growth, including through encouraging tourism
and related services and the development of certain niche products and activities such as organic
foods, horticulture, cash cropping, forestry and related activities, and ICT-related industries.
Consistent with Bhutan’s emphasis on environmental conservation and sustainable development, the
policy promotes green growth. The government has ambitious plans to develop tourism, with the
aim of increasing tourist arrivals to 200,000 by 2018 (a fourfold increase from 2012).
Staff Views
37.
Economic diversification will ease pressures on external balances, lower output
volatility and promote employment creation. Even though hydropower exports are expected to
dominate export receipts in the medium term as large projects come on-stream, revenues from this
sector should be leveraged to encourage development of a wider range of private sector activity
(such as addressing the skills mismatch and investing in infrastructure). As noted in the government’s
policy, some sectors in which efforts may be focused include tourism, education and other green
services and niche agricultural products (such as organic products), as well as power-intensive
manufacturing industries. Efforts should also be made to further improve connectivity and enhance
FDI including to facilitate technology transfer, though tax incentives need to be monitored closely
and should include sunset clauses.
38.
Improvements in the investment climate and access to finance, as well as addressing
skills mis-matches in the labor market, would support economic diversification and boost
competitiveness. Government policies should seek to address Bhutan’s relatively weak performance
on various business climate indicators. Lack of adequate finance for micro and small/medium scale
enterprises and skills mis-matches in the labor market are impediments to private sector
development. Measures to enhance training (including encouraging vocational training and
expanding technical education) programs and improve access to job-related information will be
needed to upgrade the skills of the labor force and promote employment creation. In addition,
access to finance should be enhanced by encouraging the development of capital markets for large
corporates and increased bank finance for micro and small and medium-sized enterprises (such as
enhanced credit information).
Authorities’ Views
39.
The authorities agreed that diversification is critical for Bhutan’s long-term
development prospects. However, options for raising competitiveness may be limited to niche
sectors, particularly agricultural products, which may then also boost employment, given the limited
employment potential of the hydropower sector. In the tourism sector, traditionally a growth area
for Bhutan, infrastructure development (including improved connectivity) will be key to reducing
seasonality and the relative concentration of tourism in western Bhutan.

STAFF APPRAISAL
40.
While Bhutan has made important economic and social gains, it faces growing external
imbalances and associated challenges. Rapid growth, which paved the way for rising income levels
and much-improved social indicators, has led to overheating and has placed pressure on the
country’s external position. Demand management policies have engendered a slowdown in growth,
as the authorities have stepped in to contain overheating. As Bhutan seeks to continue to augment
its hydropower capacity and meet future development goals, care has to be taken to prevent
overheating from resurfacing and external imbalances from widening further.
41.
Bhutan’s growth momentum is expected to recover in the near term. Growth is
projected to recover modestly in the current fiscal year, driven by a pick-up in hydropower-related
construction and policy measures to revive the economy. Over the medium term (corresponding to
the Eleventh Five-Year Plan), growth is expected to pick up more robustly, boosted initially by hydrorelated construction and then by electricity generation in later years. Inflation is expected to remain
elevated, closely tracking Indian inflation. At the same time, the current account deficit is projected
to widen considerably due to stronger hydro-related imports. Risks are tilted to the downside due to
high public debt, potential financial sector vulnerabilities, and the need to manage recurrent
pressures on Indian rupee reserves. The possible negative spillovers to Bhutan from slower Indian
growth are mitigated by the concentration of exports in the hydropower sector, which enjoys healthy
demand from India, and on long-term India-financed investment projects and electricity purchase
agreements.
42.
It is critical that the fiscal stance be tightened in the near term to ensure that
overheating pressures do not reemerge and public debt remain contained. Revenue reforms are
essential, including reducing the number of zero-rated goods, widening taxation of domestic activity,
and improving tax administration. In addition, if there are further shortfalls in grants, restraining
expenditure while prioritizing social and productivity-enhancing capital spending will be appropriate.
Any civil service wage hike should be accompanied by complementary revenue measures, otherwise
they could lead to further deterioration of fiscal balances and a resurgence of overheating pressures.
Over the medium-term, consideration should be given to introducing a value added tax to boost
revenue collection.
43.
Monetary conditions should be tightened to ward off prospective overheating and
manage pressures on rupee reserves. Liquidity conditions should be closely monitored and
promptly adjusted to prevent excessive credit growth in future. Specifically, the CRR should be
adjusted upward, and with further market development, more regular and increased issuance of
treasury bills should be used to mop up excess liquidity. Inflows related to hydropower projects and
aid flows should be fully sterilized. Interest rate spreads need to be narrowed and reflect market
conditions. Over the medium-term, it is essential that the monetary transmission mechanism be
further improved, and that initiatives be undertaken to further deepen the financial system.
44.
The exchange rate peg with India has served Bhutan well, though the real effective
exchange rate is assessed to be above levels suggested by underlying fundamentals. The
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

BHUTAN

ngultrum is currently assessed to be overvalued. Tighter macropolicy stances and structural reform
to enhance the business climate should also help to address competitiveness concerns. Over the
medium term, once hydropower revenues materialize, this overvaluation is projected to dissipate.
45.
External reserves have to be managed carefully to contain recurrent pressures. Timing
mis-matches in hydropower-related rupee inflows and outflows require careful management and
provisioning for the necessary rupees in advance. Also, the currency composition of reserves should
be more closely aligned with the structure of Bhutan’s external liabilities and trade. Furthermore,
once the policy stance is tightened sufficiently and revenue reforms are instituted, there should be a
gradual withdrawal of import restrictions.
46.
Growing risks to financial stability necessitate continued vigilance and action, given
past rapid private credit growth, sectorally-concentrated lending, growing asset-liability
mismatches, and lending by non-banks. Supervision and regulation need to be strengthened to
monitor and safeguard banks’ asset quality and limit systemic risk, including by use of
macroprudential measures. Measures to strengthen regulation and supervision should include
closing gaps in regulation, regular use of stress-testing by the RMA to monitor risks, encouraging
financial institutions to conduct their own stress tests, and putting in place crisis management and
deposit insurance arrangements. Also, further financial deepening should be balanced with the need
to maintain financial stability.
47.
Efforts to diversify the economy to make growth more sustainable and less volatile
should be stepped up. Diversification will ease external pressures, lower output volatility and
promote employment creation. Measures to improve the investment climate, broaden access to
finance and address skills mis-matches in the labor market would help economic diversification and
boost competitiveness.
48.
The authorities did not request and staff does not recommend approval of the
exchange restrictions maintained inconsistent with Article VIII obligations. Bhutan continues to
maintain exchange restrictions under the transitional arrangements of Article XIV, Section 2. Given
the limited and unpredictable sources of convertible currency inflows and justifiable concerns over
outflows, staff encourages the authorities to gradually ease the exchange restrictions towards their
eventual elimination including restrictions that have been maintained under Article XIV, Section 2,
which should be eliminated as soon as Bhutan’s balance of payments position permits. Staff also
recommends that the authorities eliminate the exchange restrictions, which result from
inconsistencies in the applicable legal framework or where the practice is more liberal than the legal
framework, early in the process. The authorities are encouraged to consider accepting the
obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3 and 4, of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement in due
course.
49.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on a 24-month cycle in
accordance with the Decision on Article IV Consultation Cycles (Decision No. 14747-(10/96)
(9/28/2010)).

Box 1. Gross National Happiness1
Gross National Happiness (GNH) is a unique approach to development that has been pioneered by
Bhutan. Developed in the 1970s, this approach to development, which measures well-being of its citizens
not based on GDP but on the principles of GNH, which considers the spiritual, physical, social and
environmental health of its citizens and the natural environment. Since 2008, precise metrics to measure
GNH have been developed based on equitable social development, cultural preservation, conservation of
the environment and promotion of good governance. The GNH Index provides an overview of
performance across 9 domains, which include psychological well-being, time use, community vitality,
cultural diversity, ecological resilience, living standard, health, education, good governance. According to
the 2010 GNH Survey, 40.9 percent of Bhutanese are “happy.” In March 2012, the United Nations hosted a
major conference on GNH and adopted UN Resolution 65/309 which recognized the pursuit of happiness
as a fundamental human goal. Since then, Bhutan has convened a high-level panel of international
experts to make recommendations to the UN General Assembly.

Box 2. Inflation in Bhutan1
Historically, headline inflation tracked close to the world median,
but started to diverge upward from mid-2009. Currently, Bhutan
is in the top decile of world inflation, and is tracking its peers in
frontier and developing (FD) Asia more closely as compared to
the pre-2009 period. Much of the rising inflationary trend of the
recent past is explained by greater non-food inflation. This
coincides with the expansion of domestic demand driven by
rapid credit growth, in the aftermath of the commissioning of the
large Tala hydropower project. The increase in government
wages and salaries may also have contributed to inflationary
pressures. However, in the absence of detailed data on inflation
in traded and non-traded goods and services, and the high
degree of import dependence, it is difficult to assess the role of
domestic drivers of inflation.

CPI Inflation: Bhutan vis-a-vis World

Given that the bulk of Bhutan’s imports are sourced from India
(about three quarters on average), a strong relationship can be
observed between Indian and Bhutanese inflation over a fairly
2
long time series. The growth rate of Bhutan’s CPI and India’s CPI
(industrial workers) appear to track very closely, and given the
close economic ties between the two countries, suggests an
equilibrium or co-integrating relationship in which Bhutan’s
inflation converges to that of India. Indeed, Granger causality
tests confirm that lags of India’s inflation help to explain Bhutan’s
inflation (and not vice versa). A vector error correction model
shows that inflation in both countries is cointegrated, and that
Bhutan’s inflation converges to that of India fairly rapidly within
two periods (which is equivalent to one year, based on semiannual data).

Based on this statistical relationship, a simple inflation forecasting model for Bhutan—where the change in Bhutanese
inflation depends on contemporary and lagged change in India’s inflation, lagged change in Bhutan’s inflation, and the
lagged difference between Bhutan and India’s inflation rates—shows that about 40 percent of the change in inflation is due
to the contemporary change in India’s inflation, and 60 percent due to the lagged difference between India and Bhutan’s
inflation, thereby showing strong convergence properties. Given this dynamic and forecasts of India’s inflation (see India:
2014 Article IV Consultation (IMF Country Report No. 14/57), Bhutan’s inflation is expected moderate, but remain high, at
an average of over 9 percent in the near-to-medium term.

have also funded and developed some hydroelectric
projects. In the early 2010s, Bhutan began to shift its focus to joint ventures and public-private partnerships for
future hydropower development.
GDP growth, the fiscal and external positions, monetary conditions, and public debt are driven largely by
developments in the hydropower sector. Hydropower generation is the key source of national income in Bhutan
(about one-fifth of Bhutan’s GDP) and an important source of government revenues (about 30 percent of total
revenues). Hydropower projects and credit-fuelled private consumption have propelled a decade of high growth
and improving living standards in Bhutan. While hydropower projects have boosted government revenues, they
have also given rise to recurring balance of payments pressures. External debt also increased to 85 percent of GDP
at end 2012/13, in large part due to hydropower-related borrowing. Looking ahead, during the Eleventh Five Year
Plan, Puna I, Puna II and Mangdechu hydro plants are projected to boost economic growth during the
construction phase and the commissioning stage (as they come on stream in 2017/18). The current account deficit
is projected to deteriorate over the medium term due to strong import growth associated with the construction
phase, as well as hydro debt service. Upon the completion of hydropower projects, however, revenues and
electricity exports are likely to increase significantly, and the trade balance should improve. Bhutan’s rapid
hydropower development is also projected to lead to a substantial buildup of external debt in the medium-term.
Hydropower sector development poses challenges for macroeconomic management in Bhutan. Following
the commissioning of the Tala in 2006/07, the installed power capacity of Bhutan increased three fold and there
was a surge in power exports and government revenues, a build-up of reserves, a credit boom and significant
overheating pressures (especially due to housing and vehicle loans), all of which eventually resulted in a sharp
widening of the current account deficit. A pronounced rupee shortage arose from loose macroeconomic policies,
rapid credit growth, withdrawal of short-term government and government corporation deposits (for investment
in projects), and timing mis-matches in bulky hydro-related transactions. As a result, the RMA had to resort to
recurrent short-term borrowing of rupees from India at considerable cost and selling of some of its U.S. dollar
reserves. Rupee borrowing then resulted in a contraction of the monetary base, creating tight liquidity in the
market.
Going forward, it will be important to be mindful of spillovers from hydropower-related inflows. The above
challenges may arise again as Bhutan is expected to attract more inflows (grants, loans and export revenues) for
hydropower projects. If there is a surplus on the balance of payments, there could be an expansion of the
monetary base, which, if allowed to result in high credit growth, could lead to an excess demand for Indian rupees.
Nonetheless, if the non-hydropower sector of the economy is carefully calibrated so that growth rate of imports
does not exceed those of exports and other rupee obligations, then the medium-term risks can be managed. To
be successful, this calibrated response will require coordinated fiscal and monetary policies.

Box 4. Spillovers from India to Bhutan1
The macroeconomic situation in Bhutan is closely tied to that of India. India is the largest trading partner for
Bhutan (about 80 percent of Bhutan’s commodity exports are destined for India and about 70 percent of Bhutan’s
imports are from India). India is the primary destination for Bhutan’s electricity exports and in turn supplies most
of the financing for hydropower development in the form of grants and loans—of the total rupee debt, 85
percent is outstanding public debt on hydropower projects while the remaining 15 percent represented overdrafts
from Indian commercial banks and the Government of India line of credit. Furthermore, about 35,000 Indian
tourists visit Bhutan annually and there is a strong long-run relationship between India and Bhutan’s inflation rates
(see Box 1).
This Box develops a long-run structural macro-econometric model for Bhutan to evaluate the nature and
strength of its economic linkages with India, and to
study inward spillovers to Bhutan from output shocks in
India. Using quarterly data between 1981Q2 and 2011Q2
on core macroeconomic variables for Bhutan and a number
of key Indian variables, two long-run relationships are
identified: an augmented Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)
relationship which specifies the link between “India and
Bhutan’s output differential” and “real exchange rate”, and
an equation linking Indian and Bhutanese inflation rates.2
The hypothesis that a large share of Bhutan’s output
volatility can be associated with fluctuations in India’s
growth is confirmed empirically. Specifically, any slowdown
in India can bring about negative spillovers to Bhutan. A
one percent decline in the GDP of India generates
significant output losses in Bhutan, corresponding to
around 0.18 percent after one year. Figure 1 shows the
estimated median impulse responses (for up to 40 quarters)
of the key macroeconomic variables of Bhutan to a onepercent GDP shock in India, together with the 16th and
84th percentile error bands. The results indicate that a growth slowdown in India decreases inflation in Bhutan (as
output gap widens in India) and causes a real-exchange-rate depreciation.
The growth slowdown in Bhutan can be explained both by domestic factors and, to a lesser extent, external
conditions (i.e. in India). Risk aversion on the part of global investors, in mid-2013, resulted in a moderation in
capital inflows to India, a rise in long-term bond yields, and exchange rate depreciation. Investor concerns were
amplified by India’s persistently-high inflation, worsening growth prospects, large external current account and
fiscal deficits. Bhutan, with its peg to the Indian rupee, has been only moderately affected. Considering that growth
in Bhutan is driven by hydropower exports to India; electricity generation and exports are dependent on long-term
India-financed investment projects and electricity purchase agreements; and that Indian demand for electricity is
inelastic, the negative spillover effects to Bhutan were dampened (they could have been much larger otherwise).3
Most of the slowdown in Bhutan is attributable to demand side measures put in place by the authorities.

The model has the following variables: real GDP, inflation, interest rate differential between Bhutan and India, real
exchange rate, the price of oil, real GDP of India and Indian CPI inflation. Annual data were linearly interpolated
backward when quarterly observations were missing for Bhutan.

India Selected Issues (IMF Country Report 14/58) shows that a one-percent decline in the GDP of India generates
larger output losses in Nepal.

Box 5. Real Exchange Rate Assesment1
This Box assesses real exchange rate in Bhutan using three modelbased approaches, suitably adjusted to capture the relevant
features of the Bhutanese economy and data constraints.2 These
methods include the external sustainability (ES) approach; the
macroeconomic balance (MB) method; and a (reduced form)
equilibrium real exchange rate (ERER) technique.

Several adjustments are made to the standard framework to
80
overcome the conceptual and methodological challenges inherent
75
in assessing the real exchange rate in low-income countries and
renewable-resource-rich economies. First, a large sample of countries
Sources: IMF, Information Notice System.
(including those with characteristics similar to Bhutan) is used to
calculate the CA norm and the equilibrium exchange rate misalignment, using data over the period 1973–2012 and
correcting for structural breaks in the data series. This large dataset helps to alleviate the multilateral inconsistency
problem, sample selection bias and statistical over fitting. Second, the determinants of the CA are augmented with aid
flows and remittances, to better reflect the specific characteristics of LICs. Third, an econometric technique is used that
mitigates the potential endogeneity of the variables and exploits the panel nature of the data. Finally, the CA is stripped
of Bhutan-specific temporary factors (over importation that will be accompanied by higher hydro-exports in the long
run) to arrive at a more reasonable underlying CA.
These model-based approaches indicate a real exchange rate overvaluation in the range of 8.5 to 21 percent.
The macrobalance approach suggests a CA norm of -12 percent of GDP, about 4 percentage points less than the
underlying CA in the medium-term. Based on an elasticity of the CA to the real effective exchange rate of -0.25 percent,
as referenced by Vitek (2009), this would imply an exchange rate misalignment of about 16 percent (this result also
involves a multilateral consistency adjustment). The external sustainability approach estimates a CA norm for Bhutan
which stabilizes the NFA/GDP of the country around its norm (which is estimated from a panel data model). Comparing
this CA norm with its underlying value, while using the above elasticity, implies a REER overvaluation of 21 percent.
Finally, the reduced form equilibrium real exchange rate approach suggests an overvaluation of around 8.5 percent.
These methodologies are subject to limitations and are sensitive to assumptions, and so should be viewed with
some caution. The assessment of real exchange rate misalignment in countries with foreign exchange rationing (which
are therefore persistently on the supply curve for foreign exchange and off their demand curve) is especially difficult,
because the equilibrium is not found within the data. In addition, using estimated coefficients from a panel of countries
that are in different stages of development (when compared to Bhutan) may also bias the results. Furthermore, Bhutan
is currently going though an important transition by building up its hydropower generation capacity, where such
capacity is mainly financed by bilateral aid from India. Given this structural characteristic, results using the standard
exchange rate assessment toolkit may suggest overvaluation, but some of the required adjustment in the external
position will happen naturally as the current scale-up in import-intensive investments leads to a permanent boost in
hydropower-related exports in the long run.
Over the medium term, further structural reforms are central to strengthening competitiveness. Bhutan’s exports
have shown a lack of diversification and its export basket has a falling share in world exports. Required policy measures
include addressing key structural deficiencies such as shortage of skilled labor and access to finance, as well as
encouragement of niche sectors such as tourism, agri-business, and energy intensive activities that could take
advantage of access to cheap and clean power (Selected Issues Paper III). Efforts to enhance the business climate
(Figure 4) and achieve productivity gains will help offset any potential real exchange appreciation that may follow from
rapid growth and resulting implications for the demand for nontradables.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the
view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is
meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability of 30
percent or more). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the
authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

Exchange System

Since its introduction in 1974, the ngultrum has been pegged to the Indian rupee at par. Bhutan
continues to avail itself of transitional arrangements under Article XIV, Section 2, pursuant to which
it maintains exchange restrictions in connection with: (i) the availability of foreign exchange for
travel, except for medical travel abroad by Bhutanese citizens1, invisibles2, and private transfers3; (ii)
foreign exchange balancing requirement on remittances of income in convertible currencies or other
foreign currencies from FDI; and (iii) the availability of foreign exchange for importers who are not
able to provide the identity of the seller.
Bhutan also maintains exchange restrictions subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Section 2(a)
in connection with: (i) the FX balancing requirements for imports of capital goods (for projects
involving FDI) and primary raw materials (for certain industrial projects); (ii) banning residents who
do not comply with the requirement to repatriate export proceeds from accessing foreign exchange
for unrelated imports; (iii) requiring foreign direct investment businesses to pay for their
establishment and operational expenses from their own convertible currency resources; (iv)
requiring Bhutanese companies to pay the interest on and amortization of external loans from their
own convertible currency resources; (v) restricting the availability of Indian rupee for making
payments and transfers to India in the following current international transactions: personal and
business travel and study-abroad living arrangement4, family5 and salary remittances6, advance
_______________________
1

For Bhutanese citizens, the annual private travel FX allowance is set at $3,000 (plus $1,000 per each credit or debit
card), the annual FX allowance for living expenses and stipend for education-related travel are set at $1,500 and
$900, respectively, and the daily FX allowance for business travel is limited to the amount imposed by the Ministry of
Finance on government officials. The RMA may provide access to FX above the private and education-related travel
limits on a case-by-case basis, but does not publish any guidance on it. For medical travel by Bhutanese citizens, the
exchange restriction has been removed since FX is made available upon provision of supporting documents. Resident
non-citizens, however, must use their own foreign currency sources for all types of travel.
2
Resident non-citizens must use their own foreign currency sources for subscriptions, application and testing fees
and professional membership fees. Resident Bhutanese citizens may access FX exceeding the limits (currently US$300
without documentation and US$3,000 upon providing documentary evidence) with RMA approval. While such
approval is granted based on documentary evidence, this is not specified in any RMA guidance. Thus, the limits
create a “chilling effect” with respect to potential customers, since in the absence of any published guidance, they do
not know that the limits are indicative.
3

Restrictions are maintained on residents’ family remittances in convertible currency. Residents who are not
Bhutanese citizens may transfer only 50 percent of their monthly salaries and the rest of the funds at the end of the
employment. While such approval is granted based on documentary evidence, this is not specified in any RMA
guidance. Thus, the limits create a “chilling effect" with respect to potential customers, since in the absence of any
published guidance, they do not know that the limits are indicative. Nonresidents may remit their salary only after
deduction of estimated living expenses.
4

Limits are imposed on the purchase of Indian rupee amounts for personal and business travels to India by residents
(up to 10,000 Indian rupee per day and 50,000 Indian rupee per month for personal travel, while the access to pay for
business travel daily expenses in Indian rupee is limited to the amount equal to the daily allowance imposed by the
Ministry of Finance on government officials), and living expenses of citizen students studying in India (in forms of
limits on maximum 20,000 Indian rupee stipend and 20,000 Indian rupee living allowances/incidental expenses per
month). The RMA may provide access above these limits on case-by-case review, but does not publish any guidance
on it. Thus, the limits create a “chilling effect” with respect to potential customers, since in the absence of any
published guidance, they do not know that the limits are indicative.

payments for imports from India7 and to recruit Indian workers8, imports of certain construction
materials and vehicles from India9; and (vi) banning the access to Indian rupee for unrelated current
international transactions for those who contravene RMA ‘s 2012 guidelines on Indian rupee
transactions.10
Staff is in the process of assessing other measures imposed by the authorities with respect to their
consistency with Bhutan’s obligations under Art VIII, Section 2(a) and 3.
Article IV Consultation
Bhutan is on a 24-month consultation cycle. The 2011 Article IV consultation was concluded by the
Executive Board on May 27, 2011.
_____________________

5
Limits are imposed on family remittances by Indian expatriates, who are Bhutanese residents, to pay for their
children’s certain education expenses in India (in forms of limits on maximum 20,000 Indian rupee stipend and 20,000
Indian rupee living allowances/incidental expenses per month). The RMA may provide access above these limits on
case-by-case review, but does not publish any guidance on it. Thus, the limits create a “chilling effect” with respect to
potential customers, since in the absence of any published guidance, they do not know that the limits are indicative.
Workers in specified industries are allowed to make family remittances, but with respect to workers on private
housing projects, the RMA’s 2012 guidelines on Indian rupee transactions only allow access to Indian rupee for
remittances by Indian expatriate workers on housing projects approved by March 8, 2012. There is no provision for
family remittances by resident Bhutanese citizens to India.
6

Current regulations only allow residents in Bhutan to make limited salary remittances, and there is no provision for
salary remittances in Indian rupee by nonresidents.

7

Importers making advance payments for imports in Indian rupee must submit evidence that the relevant goods
entered Bhutan within 91 days. The RMA states that advance payments can be contracted for a longer period of time,
but this is not reflected in any published guidelines or documents. Thus, the requirement creates a “chilling effect”
with respect to potential customers, since in the absence of any published guidance, they do not know that the limit
is indicative.
8

The RMA’s 2012 guidelines on Indian rupee transactions limit amounts for making advance payments to recruit
Indian expatriate workers (up to 8,000 or 1,000 Indian rupee, depending on the type of employers). Moreover, these
2012 guidelines only specify certain employers who can purchase Indian rupee for making such advance payments,
although the RMA states that in practice other employers may purchase India rupee for such purposes as well. The
specific provision of the 2012 guidelines create a “chilling effect”, since in the absence of any published guidance,
other employers do not know that they would be entitled to make advance payments. With respect to private
housing projects, the guidelines allow access to Indian rupee for advance recruitment payments only to Indian
expatriate workers on housing projects approved by March 8, 2012.

9

Pursuant to a circular issued by the RMA in 2012, no access to Indian rupee is allowed for the import of
construction materials from India for housing projects approved after March 8, 2012, or for the import of vehicles
from India. The RMA intends to remove these measures by July, 2014.
10

The RMA’s 2012 guidelines on Indian rupee transactions impose an immediate ban to access Indian rupee for
unrelated transactions by any person violating any provision of the guidelines. There are also some specific
provisions in these guidelines that state, for example, that failure to submit medical expense documentation (with
respect to both citizens and residents), or personal travel documentation (with respect to residents only) would
deprive the relevant person from accessing Indian rupee in the future. The authorities have stated that they are
willing to modify these penalties into fines, so as to remove the exchange restriction.

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
(As of March 2014)
The National Assembly finalized the Eleventh Five-Year Plan (11FYP) (2013–2018) in October
2013. The government shall focus on Self Reliance and Inclusive Green Socio-economic
Development in the Eleventh Five year Plan. Self-Reliance is interpreted as “ability to meet all
national development needs as articulated through 5 year plans by 2020” and Inclusive
development refers to “reducing poverty and inequality by enhancing the standard of living and the
quality of life of the most vulnerable sections of the society”.
World Bank Group’s Country Partnership Strategy
The current joint World Bank/IFC-Bhutan Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) covers the
period FY11–14. It is aligned with three key strategic frameworks – the Principles of Gross National
Happiness (GNH); Bhutan 2020 Vision and the Tenth Five-Year Plan (2008–2013). The CPS has two
areas of engagement: (i) Economic Diversification, Job Creation and Financial Inclusion and (ii)
Spatial Planning and Public Services, with two cross-cutting themes: capacity building and
environmental sustainability.
The next CPS is scheduled to begin in FY 2015. It is anticipated that many of the themes of the
current CPS will continue to resonate. The bulk of IDA financing is expected to continue in the form
of development policy lending, supplemented by a limited number of specific investments in key
areas, particularly where IDA resources may be leveraged, and a robust knowledge program. The
next CPS probably will also reflect a shift toward IDA-IBRD blend status for Bhutan, in keeping with
Bhutan’s emerging middle-income country (MIC) status.

International Development Association (IDA)
Lending Program
The World Bank provides around $15–20 million of new IDA resources per year. There are four
ongoing specific investment operations for a net commitment of $82 million of IDA resources. These
include three country specific IDA operations – Decentralized Rural Development, Urban
Development II, Remote Rural Communities Development – one regional IDA project – Regional
Cooperation on Wildlife Protection – and one GEF grant operation – Sustainable Financing for
Biodiversity Conservation. An additional financial project for the Urban Development II is being
prepared. In addition, the WB manages several grants for Bhutan on Disaster Management, Public
Private Partnerships, Corporate Governance, Public Financial Management and inter-governmental
fiscal relations, Urban Budget Processes, social protection.

The World Bank has extended three development policy operations over the last six years. The
most recent, Development Policy Credit-2 (DPC-2) was approved by the World Bank’s Board of
Executive Directors in November 2012 for a total of $36 million. This operation has focused on
(i)

Promoting government efficiency and effectiveness through sound fiscal and public
financial management and procurement, and strong public administration;

(ii)

Fostering private-sector development by improving the policy environment and
facilitating productive employment opportunities; and

(iii)

Expanding access to infrastructure in a sustainable manner.

Non- lending Program
The World Bank provides support on knowledge through analytical work and technical
assistance. Recent analytic work includes Gender Policy Note, a Nutrition Assessment, a Poverty and
Social Impact Analysis of the proposed Bill on Cultural Heritage, a Human Development Public
Expenditure Review, a review of higher education, and an Investment Climate Assessment which
served to underpin the most recent budget support operation (DPC-2) to improve the policy
framework governing private sector development. A poverty assessment, Financial Sector
Assessment and a green growth study are underway, as well as a financial sector technical assistance
to support the design of a financial sector strategy.

International Finance Corporation (IFC)
The IFC has a total committed investment portfolio in Bhutan of over $31 million. The
portfolio consists predominantly of IFC’s recent equity participation in Bhutan National Bank. The
advisory portfolio includes advice in structuring Public Private Partnerships (PPPs), improving
Bhutan’s investment climate and enhancing access to financial services. IFC continues to explore
areas of assistance in hydropower, tourism, manufacturing, agribusiness, health and education
sectors among others. IFC’s advisory support on investment climate reforms, PPP development and
the financial sector is expected to continue.

Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA)
In January 2013, Bhutan took the first step to becoming a member of MIGA by signing the
MIGA Convention. The Convention has been ratified by the National Assembly and the National
Council. Bhutan is currently in the process of completing the other requirements for membership.
Upon completion of the membership process, MIGA will be able to support investments in Bhutan
by providing guarantees.

RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
Bhutan became a member in 1982 and ADB began its lending operations to the country in 1983.
Bhutan is classified as a Group A country and is eligible for the Asian Development Fund (ADF)
resources. Classified as moderately debt stressed, Bhutan has been receiving a 50:50 mix of ADF
loan and ADF grant assistance since 2011. Cost-sharing ceiling has been set at 99 percent for loans,
technical assistance, and other grants.
ADB assistance has followed closely Bhutan’s Five Year Plans (FYP) and been guided by ADB’s
country partnership strategies (CPS) and country operations business plans (COBP). ADB is currently
preparing a new CPS for the period 2014-2018, in line with the government’s Eleventh FYP (2013–
2018) and Strategy 2020─ADB’s Long-Term Strategic Framework, 2008-2020. The overarching goal
of the previous CPS, 2006–2010 and interim CPS, 2012-2013 was poverty reduction through
economic diversification, and the core sectors of ADB operations were energy (including rural
electrification and renewable energy), finance, transport, and urban development. The country
assistance program evaluation, conducted in 2010, rated ADB country operations and programs in
Bhutan successful, which were found to be well aligned with country development needs,
government development priorities, and Strategy 2020.
ADB has been closely coordinating with other development partners in key sectors to avoid
duplication. It provided parallel financing for urban development in Thimphu with the World Bank,
and for rural electrification with the Japan International Cooperation Agency and the Austrian
Development Agency. ADB also collaborated with SNV on renewable energy, and is currently
supporting a pilot biogas project in southern Bhutan, which builds on the experience of SNV to
create a viable biogas sector. Other examples of effective partnerships include ADB’s rural
electrification loans following the Rural Electrification Master Plan, which was developed with
assistance from the Government of Japan. Similarly, development partners are using the Road Sector
Master Plan, which was developed with ADB assistance. ADB’s new resident mission in Thimphu will
help further strengthen its partnership and coordination with development partners.
The current COBP covers the period 2014–2016. The indicative cumulative ADF allocation for this
period in aggregate is $147 million. The 2014-2016 lending program will help develop the Nicachhu
hydropower project (Green Power Development Project II), enhance transport connectivity and trade
facilitation (South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC) Road Connectivity Project and
SASEC Transport, Trade Facilitation and Logistics Project), improve urban infrastructure (Improved
Urban Environmental Infrastructure Project), and provide additional financing to improve
infrastructure at three domestic airports (Additional Financing for Air Transport Connectivity
Enhancement Project). A nonlending program of $14.253 million has been programmed for
2014−2016.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
BHUTAN—STATISTICAL ISSUES APPENDIX
As of April 30, 2014
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. Most affected areas are: national
accounts, balance of payments, and fiscal data.
Real sector: As part of a Japan-funded technical assistance project for the Implementation of the System of National Accounts
and the International Comparison Project that will take place over the next three years, the Statistics Department of the IMF
(STA) will provide technical assistance to improve the national accounts and develop a producer price index.
National Accounts: The accuracy and reliability of the data are affected by inadequate source data. Key
shortcomings include heavy reliance on production data collected by line ministries, which often lack quality control, long lags
in providing estimates, large revisions of historical data and, in certain cases, ad hoc estimation procedures. Lack of reliable data
on expenditure components hampers estimation of national savings and domestic investment. The key factors contributing to
the data deficiency are the shortage of qualified personnel and facilities. The National Statistical Bureau (NSB) is also
constrained by the absence of a Statistics Act.
Price statistics: Starting in 2004, the consumer price index (CPI) is compiled on a quarterly basis, the number of commodity
prices has been greatly expanded, and the geographical scope broadened. Quarterly CPI series are available from March 2008
onwards. Monthly CPI series for domestic and imported goods starting from January 2013 have recently been released, but as
yet the series are too short to aid in surveillance. NSB released the first monthly PPI series starting Q2 of 2012.
Government finance statistics: Despite recent improvements in the quality of government finance statistics (GFS), the fiscal
data are subject to frequent and substantial revisions, particularly in the expenditure area. The compilation and dissemination of
budget execution data and GFS are very limited. Only annual budget execution data are compiled and disseminated, but with a
long lag. No GFS are disseminated nationally. Quarterly data are now produced and made available internally. There are
inconsistencies between the fiscal and monetary data with regard to bank financing, stemming from differences in the definition
of government.
Monetary statistics: While monetary statistics are generally consistent with the Fund’s guidelines, there is room for
improvement in a number of areas, specifically: (i) the valuation of financial assets is based on purchase price while market or
market-price equivalents would be preferable; (ii) to avoid misclassifications, a list of government units and nonfinancial public
enterprises should be prepared and shared with the reporting financial institutions; During the technical assistance mission on
Monetary and Financial Statistics (MFS) in March 2010, the authorities and STA improved the timeliness of data reporting to STA
to be in line with national publications. As part of the mission objectives, the Royal Monetary Authority (RMA) has also
submitted to STA the Financial Soundness Indicators (FSI) for Bhutan on a quarterly basis, which have been published on the
IMF’s FSI website: http://fsi.imf.org/.
Balance of payments: Despite significant improvements, external statistics continue to be affected by shortcomings. These
include: (i) limited coverage of services’ transactions in the current account, (ii) long lags in dissemination.
Building on the technical assistance mission in June 2009, a mission in March 2011, in conjunction with the RMA, developed the
International Investment Position for Bhutan and a plan for improvement in balance of payments statistics. It includes a
quarterly business survey, improved estimation methods, and increased timeliness. The mission was able to identify and correct
some measurement problems, significantly lowering net errors and omissions in the BOP. The RMA currently compiles and
disseminates quarterly balance of payments data. Bhutan began supplying balance of payments data for publication in IFS in
November 2010 and currently submits the BOP data in BPM6 format to the Fund. Authorities have also been participating in
IMF’s Coordinated Direct Investment Survey from 2011.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

May 30, 2014

Approved By
Paul Cashin and Ranil
Salgado (IMF) and
Jeffrey Lewis and Ernesto
May (IDA)

The Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) has been prepared
jointly by IMF and World Bank staff, in consultation with the
authorities, using the debt sustainability framework for lowincome countries approved by the Boards of both
institutions.

Based on the Joint Fund-Bank Debt Sustainability Framework for Low-Income Countries
(LIC DSA), Bhutan’s risk of external debt distress is moderate. Bhutan’s rapid hydropower
development is projected to lead to a substantial buildup of external debt in the mediumterm, with debt ratios breaching most of the country-specific indicative thresholds for
protracted periods of time. Also risks stem from volatile hydro-related debt service
payments. Bhutan’s debt situation is only expected to improve over the long run, reflecting
significantly higher electricity exports when more hydropower projects come on stream.
The staff’s assessment is primarily based on unique mitigating factors, namely explicit
guarantees from India that cover financial and construction risks for the hydropower
projects, thus allowing for the exceptional treatment of hydropower loans from India as
similar to FDI—i.e., non-debt creating. As well, India buys the surplus output (after
domestic use) with the price based on a cost-plus basis (building in a net return of
15 percent). Other mitigating factors include Bhutan’s strong track record of project
implementation, rapid growth in energy demand from India, committed donor support,
and Bhutan’s high level of international reserves.1 Notwithstanding these mitigating
factors, staff cautions against further new non-concessional borrowing as the level of debt
has increased substantially compared to previous DSAs. Stress tests to public sector debt
dynamics reveal the need for fiscal consolidation and the importance of sustaining rapid
economic growth going forward.

Bhutan, with an average Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) index of 3.85, is currently
classified as a strong performer with regard to its policies and institutions.

BHUTAN

BACKGROUND
1.
Bhutan’s public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) external debt increased to 85 percent of
GDP at end 2012/13 adding 14 percentage points of GDP to the previous year. The rise in the
external public debt was, in large part, driven by hydro sector related external borrowing (with an
outstanding stock of 48 percent of GDP). Hydropower projects are primarily financed by India with a
mix of loans (70 percent) and grants (30 percent). A large portion of external debt continues to be
denominated in Indian rupees (and related to hydropower sector debt), which accounts for 61 percent
of total external debt, with convertible currency debt accounting only 29 percent. Domestic debt was
entirely due to the loan to purchase aircraft for Druk Air in 2009/10, and the increased domestic debtto-GDP ratio at about 6 percent of GDP in 2012/13 reflects the fiscal outturns in the following three
years.

UNDERLYING DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
ASSUMPTIONS
2.
Under the baseline scenario, Bhutan is expected to pursue expansion in its power
generation capacity to about 10,000 MW by 2020. The hydropower development policy of Bhutan
consists of eleven new hydropower projects (see text table), which would quintuple Bhutan’s power
generation capacity. External financing for non-hydropower sector activities continues to remain
predominantly from multilateral and bilateral donors at concessional terms. In addition, the government
has a stand-by facility with the Government of India to relieve temporary BOP pressures, as well as a
swap line with the Reserve Bank of India and overdrafts with Indian commercial banks. These also add
to the external debt stock when availed.

3.
The hydropower sector developments will govern the rest of the economy as
summarized by the following key baseline macroeconomic assumptions.


Real sector: Similar to the spike in real GDP when Tala hydropower project was
commissioned in 2006/07, Puna I, Puna II and Mangdechu hydropower projects will
continue to boost economic growth during the construction phase and as they come on
stream in 2017/18. Real growth in the medium-term is projected to remain at around
8½ percent, close to its 10-year historical average of 8 percent. As construction of hydro
projects phases out, growth will gradually return to around 6¾ percent in the long-term.



Fiscal sector: Upon completion, the hydropower projects will boost the domestic
revenue-to-GDP ratio, similar to when Tala hydropower project came on line. External
budgetary aid is projected to decline as a share of GDP as Bhutan’s per capita income
rises. On average, the overall fiscal deficit remains broadly balanced over the long term.



External sector: The current account deficit is projected to deteriorate over the medium
term because of strong growth in import demand associated with the construction phase
of the hydropower projects, as well as hydro debt service. Upon the completion of
hydropower projects, however, electricity exports are likely to more than triple from
current levels, and the current account deficit should decline over the longer term,
leading to balance of payment surpluses from 2020 onwards.

EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
A. Baseline
4.
Bhutan’s external debt closely traces hydropower cycles. External debt as a share of GDP is
projected to rise to 121 percent of GDP in 2016/17 in line with disbursements for hydropower-sector
projects, before declining slightly to 116 percent of GDP in 2017/18 with the completion of the first
phase of hydro construction (Table 1). The stock of external public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) debt
is expected to gradually decline in the long term to about 29 percent in 2034 once construction of most
of the hydropower projects is completed and debt service commences to pay down the debt stock. As
a result, the present value (PV) of PPG external debt-to-GDP gradually declines to 25 percent only over
the long term. The PV of debt-to-exports ratio falls below the threshold of 200 percent also only in the
long run and remains above the threshold for most of the projection period. The PV of PPG external

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BHUTAN

debt to revenue is also on a downward trend from a peak of 750 percent in 2014/15 and is projected to
fall below the threshold of 300 percent only in the long run.2 However, all the debt ratios remain above
the LIC-DSA indicative thresholds for a significant part of the projection period under the baseline. The
commissioning of the hydropower projects (in 2017/18), which also marks the start of the debt
repayment, puts the debt ratios on a steady downward trajectory.
5.
Debt service-to-export ratio is expected to remain below the indicative thresholds for
most of the entire projection period. However, debt service-to-revenue ratio breaches the indicative
threshold as Puna II and Mangdechu’s debt service begin in 2018/19; however, it is expected to fall
below the threshold over the long run.3 The protracted breaches of the thresholds over the medium
term would indicate a high risk of debt distress, although strong mitigating factors exist for hydropower
debt.
6.
Excluding hydropower debt from the total (i.e., treating these loans like FDI), breaches of
baseline debt-ratios are temporary and/or marginal. The assumptions in the scenario are the same
as the previous one outlined in paragraph 3. All hydropower loans are excluded to assess debt
dynamics of non-hydro debt. The results of this scenario are that non-hydro debt ratios are well below
the threshold in case of PV of debt to GDP, exports and revenues. There are temporary breaches in the
case of the debt service indicators.

B. Sensitivity Analysis
7.
The PV of debt-to-exports and debt-to-revenue ratios (which are two of the external
debt sustainability thresholds) are breached under stress tests (exports shock, exchange rate
depreciation, growth shock and unfavorable financing terms). The standard sensitivity analysis points to
a moderate risk of debt distress (Figure 1 and Table 2), as all debt burden indicators (PV of debt-toexports, debt-to-revenue, and debt-to-GDP ratios) breach their respective thresholds after the shocks in
2014 and only come down in the long run (except under the historical scenario). Based on the bound
tests, the most extreme stress for the PV of debt-to-exports or revenue ratios is a one-standard
deviation shock to the exchange rate in 2013–14. However, this shock overestimates Bhutan's debt
vulnerability since a large share of Bhutan’s external income is in Indian rupees, which act as a natural
hedge to the rupee-denominated debt.
8.
Debt service ratios also breach their respective thresholds for parts of the projection
period. The debt service-to-export ratio breaches the threshold under a growth shock and the debt
service-to-revenue ratio breaches the indicative threshold continuously under the shock scenarios.

The PV indicators exceed ratios in nominal terms due to non-concessional nature of outstanding debt
(hydropower-project loans, Dungsam-cement-company borrowing, stand-by-credit-facility with government of
India, SWAP arrangement with RMA, and borrowing from Indian commercial banks).
3

Revenues used to pay for amortization are accounted in the budget as repayable in net lending. The DSA
template adds these numbers to revenues to better reflect the capacity of the government to service the debt.

PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
A. Baseline
9.
The baseline public debt dynamics trace closely the path of external debt. The public
debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to rise to 129 percent in 2016/17 and then decline gradually until it
reaches 35 percent of GDP by end 2033/34. External financing is projected to shrink as a share of GDP,
making room for domestic financial markets to play a larger role in the financing of the development
agenda.

B. Sensitivity Analysis
10.
The public debt ratios are projected to be on a declining path over the long term under
various stress tests. A one-time depreciation results in an upward shift in the various public debt
indicators without affecting the shape of the debt indicators’ path. However, the sensitivity analysis
suggests that the debt service ratios are susceptible to extreme shocks, given the bunching of
repayments in the outer years. This scenario underscores the importance of containing fiscal deficits to
ensure the sustainability of public debt.

STAFF ASSESSMENT
11.
Despite worsening of debt ratios compared to the 2011 DSA, staff maintains the
assessment that Bhutan’s risk of external debt distress is moderate due to the presence of
unique and strong mitigating factors. These factors are primarily the explicit guarantees from India
that cover financial and construction risks for the hydropower projects (Box 1). As well, India buys the
surplus output (after domestic use) with the price based on a cost-plus basis (building in a net return of
15 percent). This unique arrangement allows for an exceptional treatment of hydropower loans from
India as similar to FDI—i.e., non-debt creating.


The addition of new hydropower projects leads to a substantial build-up in external debt,
relative to the analysis in the 2011 DSA. The policy-related LIC-DSA thresholds are
breached for most of the indicators and remain breached for a longer period compared
to the previous analysis. As Bhutan’s debt carrying capacity only improves in the long run,
staff cautions against any additional non-concessional borrowing. Also, Bhutan’s (i)
concentrated export base, (ii) rupee-reserves mismatch with external debt and the trade
structure of the country (and the consequent buildup of debt related to the overdrafts)—
see Selected Issues paper on reserve adequacy and reserve management, and (iii) its
fiscal stance, leave it vulnerable to export and constant primary-deficit shocks and any
shortfalls in aid inflows. These vulnerabilities are confirmed by the stress tests in the DSA
which reveals potential vulnerabilities in Bhutan’s external debt situation. Additional risks
stem from volatile hydro related debt service payments requiring provisioning of rupee
reserves. Two episodes of rupee shortage in 2006/2007 and as recently as 2011/12 are
partly explained by lumpy debt service payments.



However, the guarantees from India mitigate risks related hydropower loans, with debt
and debt-service ratios significantly lower and breaches of indicative thresholds
temporary and/or marginal, once these loans are excluded. These additional projects also
confer strong economic dividends in the long-term, boosting real GDP growth and
exports.

12.
Furthermore, mitigating factors that were also highlighted in previous assessments
remain valid, namely:


Bhutan has a strong track record of project implementation.



Bhutan maintains close economic and political ties with India, which mitigate the
commercial risks of these projects. India has been both the main provider of financing for
hydropower projects and the main consumer of the projects’ electricity output. Going
forward, India’s sizeable power deficit will continue to support the demand for Bhutan’s
hydropower.

Box 1. Institutional and Legal Arrangements of Inter-Governmental
Hydropower Projects in Bhutan
Intergovernmental hydropower projects in Bhutan are being undertaken under a unique arrangement
between India and Bhutan, reflecting close links between the two countries. Under the “10,000 MW by 2020”
bilateral cooperation agreement signed on 26th July 2006 and the protocol to the agreement signed on 16th
March 2009, the Royal Government of Bhutan (RGoB) and the Government of India (GoI) agreed to develop
5 intergovernmental projects (Chhuka, Kurichhu, Tala which have been commissioned, and Punatsangchhu I,
Punatsangchhu II, Mangdechhu which are under construction).
Under the intergovernmental agreement, a detailed project report (DPR) is prepared by a GoI undertaking.
The report reviews all technical and financial aspects of the project. After the DPR is final and endorsed by
the 2 countries, a Project Agreement between Bhutan (Ministry of Foreign Affairs) and India (Ministry of
External Affairs) is signed, which establishes:
 Sole ownership of the project by the RGoB;
 Estimated cost of project, and establishes GoI’s sole responsibility for funding (including additional
costs);
 Terms of financing (share of grant versus loan financing from India, simple - non capitalized interest
rate, amortization period, with the first repayment starting one year from the mean date of commercial
operation)
 Setting-up of a project authority for the construction, operation, maintenance and evacuation of the
surplus power, with a chairperson appointed by RGoB;
 Handing over of the project by the project authority to the RGoB within 2 years of completion of the
project and dissolution of the project authority at the time;
 That the GoI will purchase all the surplus power from the project (over and above domestic use);
 Principle of a “cost plus” approach for the determination of the power rate at the time of commissioning
the project. Cost plus includes the costs of the project, financing costs, operation and maintenance
charges, (accelerated) depreciation and market conditions and a net return of 15 percent.
 The principle of reviewing the rate every 3 years.
Once the project has finished construction and is commissioned:
 a protocol to the Project Agreement is signed between RGoB (Ministry of Economic Affairs) and GoI
(Bhutan Embassy), which establishes the rate at which the surplus power will be sold to GoI, authorizes
the designated nodal agencies to enter into a Power Purchasing Agreement (PPA) following the
principles established in the Protocol;
 a protocol to the Project Agreement is signed between RGoB (Ministry of Finance) and GoI (Bhutan
Embassy), which establishes the principal to be repaid, repayment schedule and interest.
 a subsidiary loan agreement between the Government of Bhutan and Druk Green Power Corporation
(DGPC), a Public Holding company part of Druk Holding Investments (DHI), treating the MoF loan as onlending to DGPC. The agreement follows the same terms as the umbrella agreement, DGPC payments to
MoF treasury having to be made a week before the due date to GoI.
Assessment of Debt Sustainability risks of Intergovernmental hydropower projects
Debt sustainability risks are minimal: (i) construction risks are born by GoI, (ii) power rates are determined at
the time of the project commissioning, when the actual project cost is known, and are set to allow revenues
to service debt and a financial return; (iii) hydropower project are insured (and re-insured) for natural
disaster. The only risk is hydrological after commissioning of the project, if electricity, once the project is
commissioned, could not be generated.

Sources: Country authorities; and staff estimates and projections.
1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly a
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION—
ENHANCING FINANCIAL SECTOR SURVEILLANCE

KEY ISSUES
Bhutan’s financial sector has substantially deepened in recent years through high
credit growth and entry by new banks. However, rapid credit expansion has had
negative side effects by contributing to overheating and the buildup of financial sector
risks. Financial institutions’ risk management has not kept pace, and sufficient assets are
not available for liquidity management or investment diversification. Growing liquidity
and interest rate mismatches need to be addressed by the regulatory framework.
Bhutan should aim to develop a comprehensive Financial Sector Development
Strategy (now underway with World Bank assistance). This should entail a careful
sequencing of reforms within a medium term plan while balancing any trade-offs
between financial stability and deepening. The strategy might include measures such as
floating minority shares in public enterprises; encouraging private bond issuance; and
creating an enabling environment for private equity including by relaxing constraints on
foreign involvement in venture capital funding. It should also encompass improved
access to financing by individuals and by small- and medium-sized enterprises under the
authorities’ Financial Inclusion Policy.
Improving banks’ ability to manage financial risks is essential for further sustained
financial deepening. Development of financial instruments and markets, including
through increased and regular Treasury bill issuance, will allow financial institutions to
manage risk better themselves, while facilitating effective transmission of monetary
policy. This would be supported by an improved liquidity management framework for
the RMA.
Regulation and supervision should be further developed. There are immediate needs
to fill gaps in regulation, including putting in place effective bank liquidity requirements;
increasing use of stress testing to monitor risks associated for instance with large
exposures and with rising funding costs; and implementing crisis management and
deposit insurance arrangements. The RMA should continue with work on broadening the
range of macroprudential tools.

INTRODUCTION
1.
Bhutan was selected as pilot case for the initiative on Enhancing Financial Sector
Surveillance called for by Executive Board in May 2012 (FO/DIS/12/66).1 ,2 As an input to the
Article IV consultation, this supplement assesses the extent to which a shallow and undiversified
financial sector in Bhutan has created macro-financial vulnerabilities that impact the economy, and
its ability to sustain growth and reduce poverty, how the country can generate financial deepening
that will provide greater access to credit and financial services, and whether the process of
deepening itself has increased risks in the financial sector. It also explores how the state of
development of the financial system may have constrained monetary policy implementation and the
efficacy of the transmission mechanism.
2.
Bhutan is a small, fast-growing, lower middle-income country with deep economic ties
to India and a peg to the Indian rupee. Hydropower projects exporting electricity to India and
credit-fuelled private consumption have driven a decade of high growth, which in turn has led to
improving living standards and appears to have been a key driver of a rapid expansion of the
banking system. However, the country is vulnerable given the rapidly growing (until recently)
borrowing from banks against the backdrop of weak regulation and supervision. A key challenge is
mediating large expected flows from hydropower development into productive uses for the
economy, while coping with volatility in the associated external financing and proceeds.
3.
The country faces recurring balance of payments pressures stemming from a
combination of factors. These include loose macroeconomic policies, rapid credit growth (which
has led to higher imports), and time-inconsistency in bulky hydro-related transactions in particular,
rupee debt repayments in January and hydro-related export receipts during the rainy season in July–
September. As a result, the authorities have had to resort to recurrent short-term borrowing of
rupees from Indian commercial banks (now refinanced by the Indian government and Reserve Bank
of India (RBI)) at considerable cost. A pronounced rupee shortage in 2011–resulting from excessive
credit growth, house price appreciation, and a consumption boom–led the Royal Monetary
Authority (RMA) to sell 20 percent of its U.S. dollar reserves in December 2011, with a subsequent
sale in June 2013.3 Continued shortages led to the adoption in 2012, at the recommendation of a
government Task Force, of corrective measures including banning of imports of vehicles and
construction materials. Reserve requirements were relaxed to ease the liquidity stress on commercial
banks, as were provisioning requirements, and lending for construction and vehicle imports was
banned, while planned macroprudential measures that would have strengthened capital standards

Although Bhutan primarily needs Indian rupees for trade settlement and debt service, with de facto full
convertibility for rupee (but not convertible currency) current and capital transactions, the Constitution of Bhutan
stipulates that foreign currency reserves of at least one year’s “essential imports” must be maintained.

were not implemented. In 2013, the newly elected government has proposed an Economic Stimulus
Plan that would inject funds equivalent to 4 percent of GDP into the financial system “to restart
lending to productive and priority sectors”.

income countries (16 percent
for low-income countries), and an “expected norm” of 27 percent based upon a regression
controlling for relevant country-specific characteristics,5 while coinciding with the median of 49
percent for South Asia. The rapid expansion stemmed from the initially low penetration, ample
liquidity from large government deposits tied in part to concessional loans and grants, growth in
civil services wages, a more liberal land use policy, and in recent years, spillovers from large
hydropower projects and the entry of three new banks in 2010. Other factors have included loose
monetary conditions (including low and often negative interest rates), the establishment of a state
pension fund, and growth in corporate borrowing particularly in special economic zones. In addition,
non banks such as the pension fund and insurance companies have also engaged in lending in the
absence of alternative investment opportunities.6

BACKGROUND ON THE FINANCIAL SECTOR
6.
Financial service providers in Bhutan can be broadly categorized as formal financial
institutions (banks and nonbank financial institutions), informal moneylenders, and
semiformal providers such as NGOs and cooperatives. In addition, Bhutan Post provides
remittance services. The formal financial sector has recently undergone significant transformation
and modernization but remains bank led. The financial sector remains shallow, with the banking
sector accounting for over 80 percent of total financial sector assets (excluding the stock exchange).

A. Formal Financial Service Providers
7.
Bhutan’s financial sector has undergone rapid changes since 2009, notably with the
entry of three new banks and one private insurance company.7 Five banks operate in Bhutan:
two incumbents—Bank of Bhutan Limited (BOB) and Bhutan National Bank Limited (BNB)—and the
three new banks—Druk Punjab National Bank Limited (Druk PNB), T Bank, and Bhutan Development
Bank Limited (BDBL). Banks offer credit facilities, savings or deposit services, insurance, remittance
services, foreign exchange services, and other financial services such as ATM services, mobile (SMS)
banking, and internet banking. BDBL is mandated by the Royal Government of Bhutan, which owns
94 percent of its capital, to operate in rural regions of the country. BDBL grants around 99 percent of
the formal loans going to the agricultural sector. Commercial financial institutions remain mostly
concentrated in urban areas, viewing rural operations as unprofitable because of high costs and low
7

Two new banks were licensed, one a subsidiary of an Indian state-owned bank and the other owned by private
Bhutanese investors. Both have been listed and issued shares on the Royal Securities Exchange of Bhutan (RSEB),
meeting a legislative requirement that any new financial institution is at least 40 percent public. The established
development finance company has also been licensed as a bank.

profits. The predominance of lending based on collateral further reduces the demand for services in
rural areas, since rural clients often lack sufficient collateral or large savings in a bank.
8.
Three nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs) provide insurance and pension services.
These are the Royal Insurance Corporation of Bhutan Limited (RICBL), the newly licensed Bhutan
Insurance Limited (BIL), and the National Pension and Provident Fund (NPPF). RICBL is the dominant
insurance provider, though BIL has quickly captured a large share of the market in its three years of
operation. Nonbank financial institutions in Bhutan—insurance companies as well as pension
boards—have been allowed to engage in retail lending activities. These institutions were initially
allowed to lend because of the small market size and limited avenues for investment. A reinsurance
company has also been licensed.
9.
The Royal Securities Exchange of Bhutan Limited (RSEBL) is at an early stage of
development. It has 21 listed companies. While liquidity remains low, the RSEBL has been
automated, leading to a 230 percent increase of the total value traded in the secondary market
between 2011 and 2012.

B. Informal and Semi-formal Financial Service Providers
10.
There is no formal microfinance sector in Bhutan, although several civil society
organizations or intermediaries provide financial services. A number of regulations aimed at
increasing financial access have been finalized, including for non deposit-taking and deposit-taking
microfinance institutions. In addition, a Financial Inclusion Policy has been drafted (see below) and is
awaiting Cabinet approval. There is growing interest among the Bhutanese in forming cooperatives
and self-help groups for saving and lending, especially in rural communities. The existing ones
provide only group savings, though many are considering expanding to lending services in the
future.
11.
Informal creditors dominate the market in communities where financial institutions
have little presence. Recent research found that that, unlike formal financial service providers,
informal providers typically only offer loans, though anecdotal evidence suggests that a few informal
lenders may also accept deposits. Informal providers can be broadly categorized into two groups:
moneylenders (individuals or businesses) and family members, relatives, friends, or neighbors.
Bhutan is a cash-based economy where households have a vibrant, if informal, savings and lending
culture. Basic access indicators in Bhutan compare favorably with benchmark countries, although
segments of the population (rural areas, women) remain underserved.8

From the perspective of the private sector, access to basic banking and savings is
good, but firms have few financing options besides credit. The World Bank Enterprise Survey has
noted the need to improve accounting, cumbersome bank procedures, difficult collateral recovery,

and limited financing instruments beyond bank credit. The difficult mountain terrain and scattered
settlements in rural areas are important constraints on financial inclusion.

13.
Uneven access to bank credit and lack of access to other financial services are possible
explanations of the private sector’s perception that access to finance remains a problem in
Bhutan. According to a series of nationally representative World Bank enterprise surveys, when
asked to rank the severity of access to finance as a constraint, the percentage of firms responding
that access to finance is a major obstacle more than doubled from 14 percent to 30 percent
between 2001 and 2009. The 2009 survey also indicated that that 22 percent of surveyed firms
identified access to finance as their biggest obstacle to doing business, more than all other

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BHUTAN

investment climate obstacles in the enterprise survey. Similarly, Bhutan ranks low among countries
worldwide in the Doing Business survey on access to credit—which does not appear to reflect recent
improvements in credit infrastructure.

14.
The range of financial instruments offered by banks has expanded. Banks have
increasingly been using cash flow based lending in lieu of collateral for enterprises. Non-loan
financial products such as letters of credit and products similar to factoring are now being offered.9
Most loans to individuals continue to be collateralized.
15.
The limited availability of financial statements for borrowers makes it difficult for the
commercial banks to carry out a proper loan appraisal for the borrowers’ credit worthiness. As
a result, they require more collateral from the borrowers.10 Overall, only half of firms in Bhutan
prepare certified financial statements.11 This is low compared to regional averages and comparator
countries.

Factoring is a financial transaction in which a business sells its accounts receivable to a third party (called a factor)
at a discount.
10

The January 2010 follow on survey included interviews with banks which corroborated banks’ difficulty in
evaluating creditworthiness of borrowers in the absence of financial statements and requiring the use of collateral.

16.
Commercial banks are also facing a lack of skilled workers in their efforts to expand
the range of financial products they offer. The need for capacity building of financial sector staff
has become increasingly important to provide efficient and transparent banking services, particularly
in an environment of increased competition among banks, due to the new entrants.
17.
From the perspective of the private sector, firms see loan procedures as complex and
lacking in transparency. In Bhutan, 37 percent of surveyed firms responded that they had not
applied for any loan in 2008, although they needed a loan for their businesses. Of these firms,
17 percent also indicated that they did not apply for a loan because application procedures for loans
or lines of credit are complex and difficult to understand.

DEEPENING THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM
18.
Bhutan has taken recent steps to modernize financial sector infrastructure, including
the establishment of a credit bureau, a collateral registry, and an improved payments system.
The Credit Information Bureau (CIB), established in 2009, is now an independent institution and is
used by all financial institutions. Coverage is now complete except for microfinance loans. It
incorporates information on 97 percent of individuals and 50 percent of corporate borrowers as of
May 2013 (see Figure 8). A collateral registry for moveable collateral was launched in August 2013
and may be an important enabler to diversify sources of collateral. An electronic funds transfer and
clearing system was inaugurated in June 2010. The system’s functionalities include credits (such as
salaries and dividends) and debits (such as utility bill payments). The RMA plans to draft a Payment
and Settlement Systems Act with technical assistance from the Reserve Bank of India. To allow for
the interoperability of ATMs and bank point-of-sale terminals, the Royal Monetary Authority
launched Bhutan Financial Switch, a national card switch system, in December 2011. The RMA has
also made the National Electronic Funds Transfer System available to the public since December
2011. This system is a nationwide inter-bank fund transfer system that facilitates transfer of funds
among individuals and institutions. The CIB could be expanded to include microfinance clients and
supporting secured transactions including by movable collateral by expanding the collateral registry.

Note: Lower daily volumes in 2012 can be explained by the rupee shortage and the
ensuing credit contraction in the banking sector.

19.
Sectoral initiatives could also be taken within the framework of a wider development
strategy. In the banking sector, there is a need to break out of current practices that limit the range
and types of loan available to borrowers while adding complexity to asset and liability management.
The CIB could continue to develop its services to include a credit scoring or credit assessment
capacity so as to equip banks to make more credit decisions based on underlying creditworthiness.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

BHUTAN

In insurance, divestment of banking business from insurance company balance sheets would provide
an impetus for widening and deepening the range of insurance services. Implementation of the
divestment requirements would need to be managed by the authorities in conjunction with efforts
to stimulate a wide range of investment securities.
20.
The formulation of a Financial Sector Development Strategy would provide a
framework for considering any trade-offs between effective regulation and supervision and
financial sector development. Analysis could be undertaken of the areas where regulatory
requirements are unnecessarily prescriptive or create obstacles to financial sector development
disproportionate to the regulatory benefit. This could be undertaken in the context of changes in
supervisory approach recommended in this paper including more risk-based supervision, increased
focus on holding management responsible and more impact assessment of regulatory changes.
While participating fully in such a review and resulting decisions, the RMA would clearly retain the
final responsibility for any changes in its approach, taking into account its statutory objectives.
21.
Extending the range and maturity of marketable government securities would deliver
many benefits. These include more effective monetary policy implementation (as discussed below),
increased bank prudential liquidity, the creation of a yield curve to underpin a corporate bond
market and support for better loan pricing as well as the long term investments required by
insurance and the NPPF as they exit lending. These benefits would have to be set against the cost
implications of government issuance given the low costs of current borrowing.
22.
Similarly, floating minority shares in public enterprises would broaden the range of
investment channels while enhancing corporate governance. The government benefits at
present from dividend income streams from these companies via its investment vehicle Druk
Holdings and Investments (DHI). Divestment of minority shares in public enterprises through an
RSEBL flotation would boost both demand and supply of marketable securities—extending the
range of shares available for investment and releasing resources for DHI to invest in a wider range of
assets. In particular, it would broaden the range of assets available to the NPPF, whose liabilities are
a state responsibility. The companies divested could include the Bank of Bhutan, which would put it
on the same basis as financial institutions required under the Financial Services Act to float at least
40 percent of their equity.
23.
The wider share ownership that could result would also make it appropriate for the
government to reconsider the taxation of corporate dividends. At present, dividends are subject
to income tax on the recipients (i.e., there is double taxation of company profits). Relief in this area
would raise returns on holdings of equities and create more options for corporate structures,
including holding companies. At present, the large share of corporate equity held by government
itself creates limited incentives for reform. Again, there would need to be a consideration of the
benefits of reform against the costs in tax income foregone.
24.
A Financial Inclusion Policy (FIP) has been drafted to facilitate access to finance for all
as a means to improving livelihoods, raising income levels and reducing vulnerability. Financial
inclusion has improved significantly, but the geography of the country remains a major constraint to

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BHUTAN

access to finance. Many rural communities are half a day’s walk or more from the nearest farm road
and are one or two days travel away from the nearest bank. The FIP was drafted through an
extensive consultation process and includes “guiding principles” used to formulate its strategies. The
authorities should consider:


The need to formulate proportionate regulation which will consider risk management, while
avoiding stifling innovation and making evidence-based analysis, is a key principle.



In cases where market failures call for Government support, subsidies should be carefully
targeted to improve the supply of financial services to underserved individuals, time bound, and
not impact the overall soundness of the financial sector.



Directed lending, to rural areas or to the agriculture sector, should be avoided, given the high
risk based on international experience that directed loans are likely to become nonperforming.



The government should facilitate access to funding for microfinance institutions (MFIs), support
the creation of a microfinance association possibly with a shared technology infrastructure, and
provide technical assistance to MFIs, help them expand their businesses, assist in their
coordination.



Proportionate increased supervisory controls and oversight mechanisms will be needed. These
controls are important to ensure that the consumer protection regulatory environment and
dispute resolution mechanisms work as intended.

25.
As highlighted in the draft FIP, support to financial literacy and to a consumer
protection regulatory environment will be a key enabler of financial outreach. Savings
strategies and attitudes suggest that Bhutanese households could benefit from financial literacy
education, as they display poor financial management skills. The research undertaken established
that savings are an afterthought as opposed to the first step in financial management. Efforts to
increase financial management skills among the Bhutanese would also likely improve their ability to
access formal financial services. In addition, no regulation on financial consumer protection exists in
Bhutan, although the Companies Act 2000 and Consumer Protection Bill of Bhutan 2010 broadly
address some consumer protection rights.12 One key client protection measure includes establishing
mechanisms and processes that ensure clients have an affordable, independent, fair, accountable,
and timely access. A clear and direct pathway for dispute resolution that is easily accessed will
greatly increase trust in the financial sector.
26.
Lenders need technical assistance to develop capacity to work with small- and
medium-sized enterprise (SME) borrowers. The Government has established an Accounting and
12

Other acts that address financial consumer protections through increased competition and an enabling
environment in the financial sector include the RMA Act 2010, Prudential Regulations 2002, Financial Services Act of
Bhutan 2011, Corporate Governance Regulations 2011, and Moveable and Immovable Property Act of the Kingdom
of Bhutan 1999, among others.

Auditing Standards Board of Bhutan (AASBB), and has started adopting standards aligned to
IAS/IFRS. This should help increase the reliability of financial information and reduce collateral
requirements. In addition, technical assistance to financial institutions and enterprises should help
financial institutions build their capacity to provide financing instruments to micro, small and
medium enterprises and ensure that the private sector has the capacity to effectively utilize finance.
27.
Development of a private equity market is a priority. There have been some positive
developments, including the licensing of Nubri Capital, a local fund management company. The
International Finance Corporation (IFC) has been exploring supporting the launch of a private equity
fund in Bhutan, in collaboration with Druk Holding and Investment and an international private
equity fund. These encouraging developments would however benefit from a better enabling policy
and regulatory environment:


The restriction to 100 percent domestic ownership rules out knowledge transfer from
experienced foreign firms. The clause requiring ownership and management to be 100 percent
domestic may be difficult to reconcile with requirements such as a minimum of 10 years
experience of the CEO in the investment and finance-related business.



The regulations seem to rule out venture capital funds, since the total investment in venture
capital cannot exceed Nu 5 million, whereas minimum capital requirements are of Nu 50 Million.
Given the nascent risk capital market and given Bhutan’s small private sector, venture capital will
be critical to boost access to finance for Bhutanese firms. Private equity regulations should
ensure venture capital can develop in Bhutan.

28.
Development of corporate bonds market would provide an alternative to bank
financing. Only Nu 4.2 billion of corporate bonds are outstanding, all four issuers being financial
institutions or state-owned companies. Several private sector firms have shown interest in issuing
bonds. A key question is whether financial institutions should be allowed to guarantee bonds, which
would jumpstart the market but could carry prudential risks and potential overleveraging of financial
institutions. The RMA is exploring how to encourage the availability of credit ratings to support
development of a corporate bond market.

ENHANCING REGULATION AND SUPERVISION
A. Recent Developments in the Financial Sector
29.
Notwithstanding entry by new banks, the dominance of existing institutions remains
mostly unchallenged. The largest institutions remain the two established banks, with 75 percent of
total bank assets of Nu 80 billion as well as the most extensive branch networks, and the longestablished insurance company (life and general), with 75 percent of total gross premium income of
Nu 1.1 billion. The NPPF, which provides pensions for government and public sector employees,
remains Bhutan’s largest institutional investor, with the assets of its various funds totaling
Nu 15 billion.
30.
Recent institutional diversification has not been matched by broadening of the sector.
Finance in Bhutan is dominated by traditional banking products and credit continues to account for
most financial assets:


Loans and advances, mostly medium and longer term and at fixed rates, represent 65 percent of
banking sector assets and off-balance sheet business of Nu 6.5 billion is mostly in the form of
credit substitutes—guarantees, letters of credit and performance bonds.



The insurance companies and NPPF offer their customers loans and advances, which for the
insurers represent 70 percent of assets and which are partly funded by borrowing from banks
(insurers may not take deposits). NPFF is more restricted in the loans it can make.



Insurance penetration is limited to 1.3 percent of GDP and density to US$25 per capita; only
limited life insurance products are available.



The government does not generally finance itself (or major projects) by issuing marketable
securities. Nu 2.5 billion of Treasury bills are outstanding and there are no longer term bonds.



Banks’ earnings derive mostly from net interest margins, with limited fees and commissions.

31.
Rapid credit growth has taken place without significant growth in reported loan losses
until recently. Banking sector capital has also been growing strongly, supported by high returns
and capital-raising by the new and existing private sector banks. However, the economic slowdown
increased NPLs from 8 percent at end-June 2012 to 12 percent at end-September 2013 (Table 4),
potentially indicating latent problems that have not yet emerged.
32.
There have been costs to the economy and banks themselves from rapid credit
growth. Import demand has been stoked by activity supported by bank lending, especially for
housing and construction (over 25 percent of the total), personal loans (18 percent) and transport
(7 percent). The banks face greatly increased challenges in asset and liability management from
balance sheets comprising traditional forms of lending (fixed rate, medium and long term) and

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

BHUTAN

increasingly short term, mobile and
individually large deposits. Corporate
deposits are now 60 percent of the
total, while retail deposits are hard to
mobilize, given interest rates of 5 to 7
percent up to two years against
inflation of over 8 percent. Given the
fixed rate, long-term basis of much
lending, there is limited scope for
banks to raise deposit rates without
cutting into their net interest margin.
There has also been a shift from term
to demand deposits (now 55 percent of
the total). The resulting mismatches
have given risen to significant liquidity
and interest rate risks in the banking
system.

33.
These reforms have not, however, yet contributed to a broadening of the range of
banking products, while the infrastructure falls short in other respects. The CIB has yet to
stimulate wider availability of unsecured credit or lending practices (and loan pricing) based on the
credit assessment of the individual borrower rather than on the sector, maturity, and availability of
security. Most lending in Bhutan is collateralized, with loans typically an initial 75 percent of the
security value. However, increasing numbers of borrowers in public and private sector employment
have access to unsecured credit serviced directly from their salary payments. Other aspects of
financial infrastructure have to be sourced outside Bhutan, including professional services such as
accounting, audit, and actuarial. The financial statements of all Bhutanese companies are heavily
reliant in practice on Indian accounting standards and audit practices.
34.

The regulatory framework has been strengthened:



A new Financial Services Act was passed in 2011, updating previous legislation, strengthening
the RMA’s independence from government and making provision for RMA to issue regulations
(those issued include comprehensive corporate governance standards).13



Capital requirements applying to banks and insurance companies have been substantially
increased since 2012 through changes to risk weightings.

13

Also issued were Regulations for Fund Management Companies in 2011; Investment Advisors Regulations, 2011;
Insurance Brokers Regulations, 2011; and Securities Brokers Regulations, 2011.

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BHUTAN



Banks are now subject to base rate regulation that prescribes how rates are to be calculated,
based on funding and other costs, subject to RMA approval. Publication of base rates is
required, which is helping to improve transparency.

35.
There remain significant gaps in regulation, however. The RMA has not yet issued all
regulations mandated by law, including insurance risk requirements (i.e., basic requirements on
valuation of liabilities, acceptable investments and a solvency margin).14 Limits on maturity
mismatches between bank assets and liabilities, although provided for in the Prudential Regulations
2002, have not yet been set in practice owing to lack of readiness at banks and to skills and
resourcing constraints at the RMA.15 Even allowing for the significance of lending, the RMA’s
prudential requirements remain overly focused on credit risk, while other risks faced by financial
institutions, including liquidity, interest rate, insurance, operational and foreign exchange risks, as
well as risks in off balance sheet business, are addressed incompletely or not at all, in both
regulation and supervision. Stress testing is not routinely undertaken and is not used by financial
institutions, although the RMA has provided input to stress tests undertaken by the IMF. Pressure on
resources in the supervision function contributed to a severe curtailment of onsite supervision work,
although this is being reversed.
36.
The RMA has been taking a more macroprudential approach to supervision and is
working on its policy approach. The RMA responded to escalating current account pressures from
2011 with a series of monetary, foreign exchange, and supervisory measures. Capital requirements
were increased significantly from end-2012, targeting sectors where banks had the largest exposure
as a result of loan growth, and were increased further from the end of 2013. At the same time
(November 2012), provisioning requirements and maximum gestation periods (the time over which
loans must be disbursed) were eased. A new RMA Financial Policy Committee is coordinating
macroprudential policy and has developed a policy framework for its approach, to be implemented
through RMA Board-approved regulations from November 2014. There are limited specific crisis
management arrangements in place. Deposit insurance arrangements are also now planned.
37.
Some recent policy changes should have a positive impact on financial sector
development.


A major project has been started by government to develop local accounting standards based
on IFRS with a view to full IFRS implementation by 2021. For financial institutions, listed and
large public sector companies, an initial 18 Bhutan Accounting Standards, likely to be
complemented by International Auditing Standards, take effect for audits in 2014.

14

Draft regulations have been prepared by a consultant and a revised version was in preparation at the time of the
EFSS mission, drawing on consultancy services funded by the Asian Development Bank.

15

The RMA is actively working with consultants funded by the Asian Development Bank on a reporting format for
banks to use (only one bank has been able to make reports under the existing format) and on developing
supervisory expertise in the area of asset and liability management.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

BHUTAN



38.

There are plans to develop a local accounting professional body with training accredited by one
or more foreign institutes. These developments should over time increase the extent and quality
of disclosures by financial institutions and other companies and address risks associated with
reliance on foreign standards and practices.
Other policy initiatives may be hard to implement without some adverse impacts.



The licensing in 2013 of a new (Indian-owned) reinsurance company will create capacity within
Bhutan (insurance companies currently cede large shares of premium income to foreign
reinsurance companies); however, the RMA’s requirement that insurers cede to the new
company a minimum of 20 percent of premiums across all lines may unduly favor that company
over foreign competition and could lead to distortions in insurers’ risk management decisions,
while raising costs.



The RMA’s April 2012 directive to insurance companies and the NPPF to plan for the
discontinuance of existing and past lending activities by January 2015 rightly sought to address
risks associated with the current combination of banking with insurance business. However, it
does not by itself tackle the underlying lack of appropriate investments for companies seeking
to invest premiums and manage significant insurance risks, including, in life insurance, some
exposure to interest rate changes arising from long-term guaranteed savings products.16



The new RMA base rate system could stimulate improved loan pricing by banks and more
lending at floating rates of interest (i.e., base rate plus a margin), but at the cost of reducing the
flexibility for banks to compete on the basis of lending rates determined by themselves.

B. Developments in Financial Soundness
39.
Financial soundness indicators for banks remain positive despite the shocks of 2012.
Bank capital ratios vary but averaged 18.2 percent for the Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR, minimum 10
percent) at June 2013. The Statutory Liquidity Requirement was also comfortably met (34 percent
compared with a minimum 20 percent). Capital quality appears high. Most is in the form of equity
and the average Tier 1 CAR was 14.9 percent at June 2013. The large share of loans in the balance
sheet and high risk weights for some loans and for concentrated sectors results in high ratios of riskweighted assets to total assets (90 percent) and low leverage ratios (6 times on average and as low
as 4 times for one bank). Loan books are relatively concentrated, with individual exposures up to 25
percent of capital (the limit is 30 percent).
40.
The capital position of banks needs careful monitoring, however, given gaps in the
capital framework and the uncertain impact of recent risk weighting changes. Capital
requirements are based on the Basel I framework, covering only credit risk and using a definition of
16

The directive was lifted subsequent to the mission, and the authorities are now developing investment guidelines
for non-banks to encourage them to gradually lend less.

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BHUTAN

capital that excludes all the deductions required under the latest international standards. The RMA
has used changes in risk weighting percentages to fine tune overall requirements for
macroprudential purposes. From end-2013, these will range from 300 percent for personal loans to
50 percent for agriculture.17 The impact of these changes will vary by bank but banks have argued
that they could result in CARs falling by 3 to 4 percentage points. The new framework of risk weights
does not, however, apply to off balance sheet business (most are 100 percent risk weighted),
reducing the risk sensitivity of the new requirements and potentially creating opportunities for
regulatory arbitrage.
41.
There are uncertainties over bank asset quality given macroeconomic developments,
and NPLs have already begun increasing as noted above. The recent depreciation of the Indian
rupee may affect the quality of loans to borrowers with convertible currency liabilities. Provisioning
levels are lower than they were in 2012 (averaging around 50 percent of NPLs) as a result of the
relaxation in provisioning requirements in late 2012, which should be reversed.
42.
Overall loan growth is already increasing again and would be boosted by government
plans to ease bank liquidity, and credit standards need careful monitoring. Loan growth has
continued, although at a lower rate since the RMA measures in 2012. Notwithstanding the RMA’s
decision to cease making Indian rupees available for imports of vehicles and construction materials,
bank lending for housing continues to rise, as disbursements continue under existing facilities,
although lending to the transport sector has fallen. In recent months, total lending has been rising at
a more rapid rate than in 2012.18 The government is proposing measures to support the availability
of liquidity for bank lending to sectors which generate low demand for imports. It will be important
to ensure that credit standards are not relaxed as banking sector liquidity eases. Banks have
indicated that demand for loans remains high.
43.
Collateral values are a key driver of loan loss and may be under pressure. Collateral
values are reported to have fallen, including land prices in parts of the country where there was a
surge in prices in the run-up to March 2012, which may lead to higher write-offs (loan losses have
been limited owing to the prevalence of collateralized forms of lending). Revaluation practices
appear to vary by bank, there are no generally accepted or widely-used price indices, and
supervisory oversight of banks’ approaches to revaluation is limited.
44.
Bank liquidity remains constrained and the Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) does not
take into account balance sheet mismatches and vulnerability to stress. Genuine high quality
liquid assets that could meet prudential liquidity standards are limited given the low issuance of
marketable government securities. In the circumstances, banks are rightly permitted to meet SLR
using claims on other banks, but these may include interbank claims up to one year and real
17

The RMA has made clear that this new framework is an interim measure and will be reviewed after six months,
taking into account how financial institutions respond.

18

Lending by banks grew at a rate of nearly 5 percent in the second quarter of 2013 compared with rates of less than
2 percent per quarter since the measures introduced in March 2012.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21

BHUTAN

liquidity is dependent on RMA balances. Few banks meet the minimum SLR, when liquid assets
(known as “quick assets”) are redefined to exclude such assets. In addition to extensive maturity
mismatching (on which no supervisory information is collected), banks’ deposit books are
concentrated, i.e. large deposits account for a significant share, mirroring the concentration of
lending. Credit demand drives balance sheet management, leading to some high Credit to Deposit
ratios, exceeding 100 percent for one bank at June 2013.
45.
Stress tests of the banks based on end-2012 data conducted by the mission
highlighted some vulnerabilities, varying by bank (Box 1). Tests based on end 2012 data (see
Box) measured the adverse impact on banks of a number of credit risk and one liquidity shocks. The
results highlighted a concentration of lending, and susceptibility to increased NPLs, whether a
proportionate increase in current NPLs or increases in particular sectors. Under all the credit risk
scenarios, a number of banks’ CARs fell below the 10 percent minimum and one bank’s ratio was
below 10 percent on all three tests.
46.
The financial soundness of the insurance sector is harder to judge in the absence of
full prudential standards.19 The CAR and SLR requirements, although designed for banks, have
some relevance to Bhutanese insurers given their significant credit risk. The minimum standards are
met by both companies. Claims ratios are healthy. Insurance risk is limited on account of the
extensive use of reinsurance, including for catastrophe risk (particularly earthquake in Bhutan). The
RMA needs to monitor exposures to reinsurers and how these are managed. Life business has been
written with high guaranteed returns, but amounts remain low.
47.
The insurance sector faces significant challenges, including divestment of banking
business. A priority for supervisors will be to monitor the impact of reduced premium income due
to the slowdown in activity in some sectors (e.g., importers and purchasers of cars) and to continue
to plan for the implications of insurance companies ceasing to act also as banks. Whether they
divest their banking business into subsidiaries or cease operations altogether, a long transitional
period may be required if the companies are to diversify from loans into a wider range of
investments.

19

Regulations have been drafted but implementation has been delayed by conflicting technical assistance
recommendations.

22

Box 1. Stress Testing of the Banking Sector
Rapid credit growth in the previous 10 years, the run up in real estate prices, and entry by new banks
highlight the need to closely monitor vulnerabilities in bank balance sheets. Stress testing provides a
tool for quantifying vulnerabilities under specific macro-financial shocks, and bank-by-bank analysis is
particularly important given the concentration of loans in the two large state-owned banks and the rapid
growth by three new domestic private banks that began taking deposits in 2010. By 2012, the new banks
already represented 18 percent of deposits and 24 percent of loans.
As of December 2012—the baseline for the
stress tests—the banking system capital
adequacy ratio (CAR) was 19.1 percent, with
non performing loans (NPLs) of 8.2 percent
and provisioning as a ratio of NPLs of 81
percent. Stress tests are described below in
three scenarios involving credit risks and one
involving liquidity risks:1
A proportional increase in NPLs scenario, in
which NPLs increase from 8.2 percent to 18.4
percent—the level reached in 2008/09;


A liquidity shock scenario, in which 15 percent of baseline demand deposits are withdrawn each day
for five days, and 95 percent of liquid assets are available for immediate sale.
The findings of the stress tests are:

A souring of large exposures, which account for 13½ percent of total loans, lowers system-wide
CAR by 8.6 percentage points, with a decline of 12.6 percentage points for one bank;

Sectoral shocks lower banking system CAR by 3.9 percentage points for all banks, and by 4.5
percentage points for private banks;

A proportionate increase in NPLs to 18.4 percent reduces the banking system’s CAR by 6.7
percentage points;

In the liquidity shocks scenario, all five banks remain liquid after five days despite the hypothetical
deposit run, given the initial high level of liquid assets relative to demand deposits.
The results highlight a concentration of lending and susceptibility to increased NPLs in particular
sectors. Under all the credit risk scenarios, a number of banks’ CARs fell below the 10 percent minimum and
one bank’s ratio was below 10 percent on all three tests. Overall, the assessment is that the financial system
is vulnerable to shocks, and close monitoring is warranted.
_____________________

The analysis does not focus on other types of risks for the following reasons: for interest rate risks, because banks’
holdings of long-term government bonds are not significant; for foreign exchange risks, because banks do not have
significant open foreign exchange positions; and for interbank exposure risks, because these exposures are small.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

23

BHUTAN

48.
Looking ahead, there are vulnerabilities and financial institutions and the authorities
need to adopt a more forward-looking approach. Balance sheets have been bolstered against
potentially worsening credit losses, and economic indicators such as unemployment are relatively
benign. However, the financial strength of individual institutions varies significantly. Moreover, for all
the banks, recent liquidity pressures have highlighted serious asset and liability mismatches—
preexisting but growing—as well as exposure to the sudden and severe measures (those of March
2012 in particular) to which the authorities had to resort to address financial imbalances in the
absence of developed financial markets and functioning fiscal and monetary policy tools. Financial
institutions are vulnerable to adverse impacts of future such measures. Given balance sheet
mismatches, they would also face significant challenges in case of financial sector reform that
exposed them to more volatile and particularly to rising funding costs.

C. Policy Recommendations
Regulation and Supervision
49.
There are a number of areas where RMA should develop its approach, both in
substance and supervisory process. The RMA’s approach has a number of strengths, including
intensive offsite supervision, based on extensive and frequent reporting by financial institutions;
oversight of the banks’ preparation of their annual accounts, including meetings with auditors and
bank management; and a readiness to hold financial institutions to its standards (i.e., not granting
waivers and exemptions) and to say “No” when necessary. However, regulatory gaps should be filled
over time, and the RMA should consider how it can move from a relatively prescriptive approach in
some areas (for example, bank base rates, requirements to purchase reinsurance, restrictions on
guaranteeing corporate bond issues) towards one based more on holding management responsible
for how they run the business, the supervisory role being to assess whether they are meeting that
responsibility and to respond where they are not. All of these changes will require RMA to rebuild
supervisory capacity through recruitment and training.
50.

Priorities should include:



Ensuring that supervisors have a view of the full range of risks in financial institutions. This will
require starting to use scenario and stress testing, for example requiring banks to quantify their
key risks including credit, interest rate, liquidity and foreign exchange risks on the basis of
certain assumptions or insurance companies to evaluate the impact of catastrophic events. In
addition, the resumption of onsite work subsequent to the mission will be essential to monitor
financial system soundness and to evaluate systems and controls, developments in credit
standards and the adequacy of management and governance.



Developing a policy framework and issuing regulations in key areas where there are gaps,
including prudential standards applicable to insurance and reinsurance, and bank liquidity. The
latter needs careful consideration given the lack of high quality liquid instruments that would
normally be at the core of any requirement for stock liquidity. The alternative is to develop a

24

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BHUTAN

mismatch limit approach as envisaged in Section 7 of the Prudential Regulations, and it is
recommended that the RMA begin with such an approach.


Developing a strategy for updating the bank capital adequacy framework in areas such as the
definition of capital (introducing a minimum Core Tier 1 Equity concept from the Basel III
framework), capturing operational risk (using the non-advanced approaches) and interest rate in
the banking book (taking into account the results of stress tests that would help establish the
extent of the risks); and developing a Pillar 2 framework to relate the capital adequacy of
financial institutions to the supervisory assessment of risks in individual companies.



Using the results of the results of the deeper risk assessment of individual financial institutions
to develop supervisory strategies in relation to each company, which would include challenging
on business strategy, controls and financial strength; in particular, any weak banks should be
identified and challenged to develop remedial action plans. With a small number of financial
institutions, RMA is well placed to take a more bank specific approach to its supervisory work,
which would also address the variable financial conditions of the individual institutions.



Developing a crisis management framework in case of a future bank failure. This should start
with the authorities evaluating what additional information they may need in case of a crisis (for
example, on immediately maturing liabilities) and ensuring that this information would be
available at short notice, and making sure that practical preparations are in place, including
updated contact details of key officials etc. In due course the work could extend to consideration
of potential changes to the Bankruptcy Act to create a bank insolvency framework. In this
context, it is important that planning for the introduction of deposit insurance resumes, as the
availability of insurance can help support retail depositor confidence in case of crisis.



Developing a policy framework on its approach to setting new standards and regulations,
covering consultation with financial institutions and preparation of impact assessments. A
number of regulatory changes have been introduced at short notice without consultation or
reference to RMA’s objectives, triggering pushback from financial institutions which it has
sometimes been hard for the RMA to resist in the absence of its own impact analysis.



Strengthening its capacity in the framing of regulations and standards through the creation of a
function within the Financial Regulation and Supervision Department dedicated to the
preparation and promulgation of new standards.

51.
The RMA should also build on its existing readiness to take macroprudential policy
measures with:


A regular review of sector-wide risks, extending the analysis in the Financial Sector Performance
Review; and



An internal policy statement on future choice and use of macroprudential tools.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

25

BHUTAN

The objectives should be to move away from the current reliance on one tool, the adjustment of risk
weightings, and, in the current context, to ensure that supervisors seek to identify and address what
may be the next source of stress rather than focusing only on present stresses related to current
account pressures.20 It must be emphasized that macroprudential tools cannot substitute for an
appropriate monetary and fiscal stance in addressing overheating pressures.
52.
Debt-to-income limits should in particular be considered, in conjunction with the
development of monetary policy tools. Some macroprudential tools used in other countries
appear to have limited relevance at present. Loan-to-value ratio limits would have limited impact
given that high levels of collateralization are part of established lending practice. Limiting credit to
deposit ratios could be introduced if and when money and capital markets develop, at which point
banks would have the scope to manage balance sheets to meet such minimums. Making monetary
policy implementation more effective should be the starting point and priority. However, the RMA
could also consider setting debt-to-income ratio limits, which have been effective in other countries,
and may also support increased focus on individual credit assessment. Limits on overall credit
growth could be considered but would be hard to calibrate.
53.
The authorities also need better to distinguish macroprudential measures from those
designed to encourage lending to particular sectors and to take action preemptively. Recent
changes to risk weighting have been driven mainly by analysis of risks in bank lending, but are also
designed to encourage lending to targeted sectors such as agriculture—reflecting the wider
government objective to stimulate sectors with lower demand for imports. The adequacy of overall
capital requirements resulting from recent changes is hard to assess, and the RMA’s recent increases
are consistent with a higher risk environment, but increasing the requirements at an earlier stage
(for instance as proposed in early 2012) might have helped moderate the rapid build-up in credit.

Developing the Financial Sector
54.
A number of obstacles have frustrated the development of Bhutan’s financial markets,
notwithstanding the significant expansion of the banking sector. The challenges include:


The absence of fully market-determined interest rates and the development of a yield curve to
support pricing in financial markets generally.



Inflexibility in credit provision—entrenched approaches to banking products and services, partly
reflecting the absence of any alternatives to bank finance, limited openness to foreign
participation and low penetration of technology.

20

Subsequent to the mission, the authorities issued proposed regulations to introduce a range of new tools,
including countercyclical capital buffers, loan-to-value and debt-to-income limits, sectoral capital requirements,
restrictions on profit distributions, and dynamic provisioning. The MCM department has offered to provide a desk
review of the proposed framework which is now being revised.

26

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BHUTAN



Limited availability of risk management instruments—in insurance (i.e. limited scope of products,
especially for life insurance and low penetration generally) and no scope for hedging of risks
through financial transactions.



Still limited infrastructure and business services, with no ratings agency, other sources of
independent evaluations of risk in financial assets or local accounting, auditing and actuarial
services; and limited expertise in modern finance.



Government ownership and control of large parts of the economy, limiting the scope for
broader participation in ownership of financial assets. (The government is committed to
retaining its most significant interests.)



Limited understanding of finance amongst investing public.



The difficulty of achieving scale in a country of only 700,000 people.

55.

Equally, Bhutan has a number of advantages that could be exploited:



Institutional and high net worth investors including the NPPF, life insurance, the funds of the
new fund management company, and DHI which manages the government’s investments and
investor interest from abroad.



A number of large public and private sector companies with a need for longer term finance and
a government with a deficit to finance.



A legal framework that is broadly understanding of and ready to support the enforcement of
financial contracts.



High quality infrastructure in payments and settlement.



Policy-makers ready to take a strategic approach as evidenced, for example, by the government
project on accounting and auditing standards.

56.
While a number of initiatives have been taken, and improvements in supervision and
regulation will contribute, more is needed. The recent expansion of the financial sector has
contributed to financial development by bringing in foreign capital and expertise and adding to
listings on the RSEB. Developing regulation and supervision will have the same effect. Strong
supervision that, for example, addresses weak banks and requires all banks to recognize full costs of
their lending decisions (for example, by addressing the risks in maturity mismatches), will support
the better allocation of resources through bank intermediation as well as promoting confidence and
helping to safeguard financial stability. Good supervisory process enables institutions to plan for the
development of their business. However, more is required.

STRENGTHENING MONETARY OPERATIONS
A. Overview
57.
Bhutan has a potential to make monetary policy contribute more effectively to
macroeconomic stability and financial sector deepening, despite a number of constraints. Due
to the peg to the Indian rupee, exchange rate changes cannot be used for macroeconomic
adjustment. As monetary transmission through interest rates also is weak (or non-existent), there is a
need to deepen financial markets, starting with an interbank market and short-term securities
market and continuing with to government and corporate bond markets. The room for an
independent monetary policy is limited due to the exchange rate regime, but there should be
sufficient scope to build a meaningful interest rate transmission channel.
58.
The RMA has until recently neither had the mandate nor the instruments to develop a
monetary regime to address the challenges of operating under the fixed exchange rate
regime. The new RMA Act of 2010 has given a clear mandate to pursue price stability as the primary
objective while secondary objectives include regulation and supervision of the financial system. As a
central bank, the RMA now has the independence to formulate and implement a monetary policy
adequate to meet its objectives. However, to a large extent, the monetary policy function has since
becoming a full-fledged central bank had a focus on dealing with a shortage of Indian rupees in the
context of limited rupee reserves. Although this is a complex problem which has been building up
over a long period, part of the unsustainable expansion of credit has been caused by high levels of
excess liquidity in the banking system over several years. Also for this reason, it is important to
establish a liquidity management system with effective market-based instruments which can
contribute to macro stability in the future and prevent recurrence of the rupee problem.
59.
Active liquidity management is the starting point for improving monetary
transmission. This is important under a fixed exchange rate arrangement as in other monetary
regimes. A strong focus on balancing and controlling short-term developments in bank reserves is a
precondition for establishing an interbank market. Although the distribution of liquidity across
banks is uneven and bank reserves are displaying large swings, a banking system which now consists
of five banks should accommodate interbank trading of short-term funds (see Figure 10). As
discussed below, the liquidity management framework has to provide stable and predictable
incentives to induce individual banks to plan and take responsibility for their own liquidity, as
described in Section C below. By giving commercial banks the right incentives to manage their
liquidity, the resulting interest rate from the transactions in the interbank market will in turn affect
other money market interest rates and influence the term structure of interest rates.
60.
More active and deeper money and credit markets will absorb and smooth out erratic
fluctuations and provide more stability through market determination of interest rates. From
this basis, the interest channel for the transmission of monetary policy impulses will evolve, which
will improve the central bank’s potential to implement an effective monetary policy in the future.

B. Government Securities Market
Present Situation
61.
Treasury bills were introduced in December 2009 to replace RMA bills with the
objectives of improving government cash management, allowing the use of market-based
instruments of monetary policy, and providing a benchmark for short term interest rates.
These objectives have not been met because of erratic issuance, unpredictable and insufficient
amounts, small market size, limited market participation, and the lack of other financial instruments
(see Figure 11).21

Treasury bills are also not being issued at market-determined interest rates. The
issuance of Treasury bills started out as a conventional market auctions, but the MoF found it
difficult to accept the interest rate outcome. Since February 2013, the interest rate has been fixed at
3 percent which is far below deposit interest rates and RMA’s policy rate. A so-call “tap-sale”
mechanism has been used in which the MoF determines the interest rate and the amount. On
redemption, Treasury bills are often rolled over and the same holders keep the security at
unchanged interest rates. Maturities have varied from 14 to 90 days, with issuance primarily at 30
days.
63.
Despite a substantial financing requirement in recent months, the government has
continued to rely on bank financing rather than T-bill issuance. First, an overdraft facility (OD) is
available at the RMA up to a limit determined as 10 percent of average revenue over the last two
years. This limit was recently raised from Nu 1.9 billion to Nu 2.1 billion reflecting this guideline. The
RMA charges an interest rate, currently 4 percent, at 1 percentage point above the rate for the most
recent Treasury bill issuance. Second, the Ways and Means (W&M) account with the largest
commercial bank (BOBL) can be overdrawn without a limit. The interest rate charged is currently 5.5
percent. As shown in Figure 11, the government will first utilize the cheaper overdraft in RMA before
making use of Ways and Means. It is also noticeable that the issuance of Treasury bills has to a large

30

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BHUTAN

extent been detached from the financing requirement. In the period under review, Treasury bills
have not been issued for monetary policy purposes.

Discussion and Recommendations
64.
Developing a government securities market is the most critical element for making
monetary policy more effective and for enhancing financial markets in Bhutan. The availability
of sufficient amounts of government securities at market-determined rates will provide a range of
benefits. First, financial institutions will be given an investment alternative which at present is lacking
for necessary portfolio adjustments and liquidity management, including meeting prudential
liquidity requirement. Second, the central bank will directly and indirectly have a basis for effectively
managing banking sector liquidity. Third, the government will have access to market financing
necessary for efficient cash management. Finally, building a (risk-free) benchmark yield curve will
have a number of positive externalities for financial sector development.
65.
The current arrangements for financing the government hamper the development of a
Treasury bill market and money markets more generally. The main sources for financing of
government should be gradually shifted from bank to market financing as the government cash
management improves and the financing requirement can be covered through an operational
issuance program of Treasury bills. At that point, the Ways and Means account with a commercial
bank should not be allowed to be overdrawn and the use of the overdraft facility in RMA should be
made more restrictive. Even though drawings stay within the legal limits, this arrangement weakens
incentives to strengthen government cash management.22 Consideration should be given to limiting
direct access to financing from the central bank to emergency situations in which access to other
funding sources is difficult. Moreover, overdraft drawings should have a limited maturity and not
generally be rolled over. This would put additional pressure on the Department of Public Accounts
to impose strict discipline on budgetary agencies to follow their cash plans and give incentives to an
active management of public debt.
66.
Although the main responsibility for a meaningful Treasury bill issuance program rests
with the MoF, the central bank has also an obligation to persistently promote the
development of a short-term securities market. Without such a market, the implementation of
monetary policy will be less effective and the transmission of interest rates more limited. It must
therefore be a joint responsibility of the MoF and RMA to establish a reliable issuance calendar for
Treasury bill and to ensure that meaningful amounts are issued also when there are no immediate
financing needs of the Government. Establishing an issuance calendar of Treasury bills (used for
fiscal and monetary policy purposes) will require a proven capacity at the central bank to forecast
liquidity and at the Ministry of Finance to forecast government cash flows.

67.
The arrangement in place for using Treasury bills both for government financing and
monetary policy purpose should be fully utilized.23 This is a progressive and forward-looking
decision by the authorities which could have important advantages for market development and the
use of RMA bills should not be resumed. A combined issuance program using Treasury bills for both
fiscal and monetary purposes would broaden the basis for establishing reference rates for the
pricing of financial assets. On its part, the RMA should for liquidity management purposes preferably
issue Treasury bills with shortest maturities, with maturities and amounts being determined by the
expected liquidity management needs. Issuance of Treasury bills for both fiscal and monetary
purposes will necessitate robust arrangements to prevent the government from utilizing the liquidity
that has drained from the system for monetary policy purposes, as well as an appropriate
communication strategy with market players to communicate the policy direction.
68.
Market financing of government cash requirements and liquidity absorption at market
rates will imply increased costs to the budget and to the RMA. These costs are outweighed by
the benefits of having a more developed financial sector and better tools for achieving stability in
the economy. It is also not obvious that the cost of Treasury bill issuance for monetary purposes
should be born exclusively by the RMA. The present arrangement as specified in the November 2009
Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) clearly states that the cost of Treasury bills issued for
monetary policy purposes should be borne by the RMA. In general, providing liquidity to the
banking system generates interest earnings for the central bank while draining liquidity using
market-based instruments carries costs. Too much focus by a central bank on the profit position
may defer necessary market operations.
69.
It is important to establish an acceptance that the cost of monetary policy ultimately—
directly or indirectly—must be borne by the budget. This is because the finances of the
government and the RMA must in the final analysis be considered on a consolidated basis. Taking
sterilization costs directly into the budget—for example through the issuance of Treasury bills for
monetary policy purpose—may be a better alternative than having to repeatedly recapitalize the
central bank.24 In order to provide certainty to the institutional arrangement safeguarding RMA’s
financial position and its ability to conduct monetary policy, the RMA and the MoF could consider
adjusting the existing MOU on this point. A binding cost-sharing arrangement should be established
in which the government’s willingness to protect the central bank for taking on these costs as part
of implementing monetary policy is clearly stated. The revised MOU should specify how the RMA
could be reimbursed for the costs that cannot be absorbed on its own balance sheet in connection
with issuing Treasury bills for sterilizing liquidity. This would support to the independence and
autonomy of the RMA. Public knowledge of such an arrangement will strengthen confidence in the
RMA, as it would not be constrained by profit considerations when it needs to tighten monetary
23

An MOU between MoF and RMA of November 2009 gives the RMA the authority to issue Treasury bills for
monetary policy purposes; this arrangement replaces the earlier use of RMA bills.

policy. Although the Treasury bills issued for different purposes are identical for the investors, there
should be full transparency as to the distribution of issued amounts between the MoF and RMA.
70.
Apart from cost sharing, cooperation and coordination between the MoF and the RMA
on debt and liquidity management should be strengthened. While the management of public
debt is clearly the responsibility of the MoF, the RMA should be given the opportunity to comment
on the debt strategy before final decisions are taken. The choice of instruments, maturities, and
amounts may have implications for monetary policy implementation and should therefore be
factored in, if possible. The existing Treasury Bills Management Committee should meet regularly
(e.g. weekly)25 and be fully used as a platform for sharing all relevant information in relation to the
implementation of fiscal and monetary developments between the two institutions on an ongoing
basis. Furthermore, in determining the short-term borrowing requirement of the government, there
should be some flexibility to take into account factors which can influence RMA’s liquidity
management.
71.
The technical infrastructure supporting a Treasury bill program needs to be
strengthened. At present, the ownership records are maintained in an Excel spreadsheet at the
RMA. An automated depository system should be developed to facilitate transfer of ownership
resulting from secondary market trades and allow for temporary transfers in connection with the use
of securities as collateral and in repurchase transactions. Ideally, the depository should be integrated
with the payment system to ensure delivery versus payment. As the payments system recently
adopted by the RMA is based on the RBI system, the RBI could be approached for support in
extending this system to include a depository.26
72.

Along with the technical infrastructure, a viable Treasury bill program should also be

supported by market infrastructure. This should include regulations and market practices, and
clear guidelines for trading and settlement. The RMA should assume the main responsibility for this
task, in close collaboration with MoF.27 It would be useful if the traders themselves established a
Code of Conduct. For example, under the umbrella of the Financial Institutions’ Association of
Bhutan (FIAB), a forum of bank treasurers should be set up. One of the first tasks of this group
should be to discuss and adopt a Code of Conduct for trading in the domestic money market and,

25

The present arrangement specifies that meetings should take place as and when necessary but not less than once
a quarter. In a dynamic market environment, with an active Treasury bill issuance program, the frequency of meetings
should be considered.

26

The Royal Securities Exchange of Bhutan (RSEB) has a depository in place for debt instruments. While multi-year
government bonds may be listed and traded at the RSEB, it is generally advisable to start the infrastructural
development with a separate depository—most often in the central bank—for Treasury bills (and other money
market instruments). In addition to fast and secure settlements, this will allow for Over the Counter (OTC) trading
which has proven to be the most effective way for developing a secondary market for these instruments.

27

This is also the recommendation of aFiscal Affairs Department mission.

perhaps, foreign exchange market. This activity should be utilized as a vehicle for training and
increasing trading skills among bank treasurers.

C. Enhancing Monetary Operations
Present Situation
73.
The RMA continues to rely heavily on direct instruments and administrative
intervention to implement monetary policy. As such, the use of the reserve requirement (cash
reserve ratio (CRR)) and liquidity regulations (SLR) have been central tools. Banks have separate CRR
accounts, and there is not a provision for banks to meet the requirement on average during a
maintenance period. Efforts have been made to move in the direction of more market based
instruments, but the use of RMA bills and, more recently Treasury bills, has not achieved the
intended objectives. In connection with the rupee stabilization measures introduced in March 2012,
a number of new monetary policy instruments were announced with the intention to make
monetary policy more effective. This included a “lender of last resort” facility (RMA Short-Term
Liquidity Adjustment Window (RSTLAW)) which would provide funds up to 90 days. This facility was
priced 1 percentage point above the Policy Rate which also was introduced. It is currently set at 6
percent. The facility has been used only once, mainly because banks lack collateral but also
reflecting excess liquidity. The intention was also that the Policy Rate should set the price for central
bank funds in ordinary market operations, but as such operations have not yet taken place the
Policy Rate has so far had no practical purpose. Base rate regulation was also introduced (see above)
with the aim of increasing transparency and improving the transmission of monetary policy. While
there may have been some positive effects in meeting the first objective, it does not appear that
transmission has been improved by the introduction of base rates.
74.
A fairly recent administrative measure to influence banking system liquidity is to
sweep balances of selected accounts in commercial banks to the RMA overnight. This is a
normal practice in connection with the management of Treasury Single Accounts (TSA) in central
banks where funds collected by commercial banks or any unused balances on settlement accounts
are swept overnight to the central bank. In Bhutan, sweeping has been used to manage liquidity,
and the practice has been extended to a number of large accounts (currently 8), including mostly,
but not only, hydropower project accounts. The daily amounts involved vary between Nu 500 million
- Nu 1.2 billion. The sweeping was discontinued at the end of May 2012 when liquidity became
tight, but was resumed in the beginning of July 2013. This indicates that although the stated
objective is to sterilize volatile hydropower related funds, the measure has also been used as a
general liquidity management tools (see discussion below).
75.
There is a limited interbank market in Bhutan, with banks and other financial
institutions making unsecured placements with each other on a regular basis. These
placements are almost never short-term, and normal maturities range from 90 days to one year. The
interest rates are said not to fluctuate much (according to a “gentlemen’s agreement”), but follows
the interest rates for corporate deposits. An indication of this activity is shown in the Figure 12

below. Both demand and time deposits with other banks qualify as Quick Assets in relation to the
SLR, and bank placements make up about one-third of all Quick Assets.

There are no foreign exchange transactions between banks, and banks are only
allowed to deal in foreign exchange with their customers at rates fixed by the RMA. The RMA
fixes buying and selling rates daily based on the US$/INR closing rate the day before. Banks are
obliged to use these rates in their retail transactions and they are not allowed to make transactions
within this margin. (Under a similar system in India, banks are allowed to trade within this margin).
Banks can at any time sell convertible currencies to the RMA when they are approaching a fixed limit
(US$10 million for larger banks and US$5 million for smaller banks). All sales and purchases of
foreign exchange with the RMA take place at the mid-rate. This arrangement gives no incentives to
interbank trading.

Discussion and Recommendations
77.
An operational liquidity framework will be an important mechanism to develop the
capacities for formulating monetary policy and analyzing financial stability. By monitoring the
factors influencing liquidity developments and banks’ behaviors, the central bank can develop a
better understanding of current and future trends affecting liquidity developments in the banking

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

35

BHUTAN

sector. The standard approach for most central banks is to make forecasts in order to observe banks’
reserves and calibrate open market operations to deal with disrupting fluctuations. Technical
assistance has been given in the past to set up a liquidity monitoring framework, but availability of
data to the RMA has made the updating very difficult. As the most difficult and important data input
is government cash flows, the ongoing TA to the Department of Public Accounts on cash
management and the introduction of a TSA should improve the basis for liquidity forecasts. It is
important that the RMA becomes involved in this work so that the cash flow projections can be
directly entered into the liquidity forecasts. Cash flow forecasts would also need to reflect
information about large hydropower related flows. It is important to note that not all cash flows
have immediate liquidity effects, such as foreign exchange transactions and other transactions
between the government and RMA. Under a fixed exchange rate arrangement, the RMA should
develop its capacity to offset domestic sources of volatility in bank reserves to avoid corresponding
adverse fluctuations in interest rates.
78.
The reserve requirement system (CRR) should be redesigned to enable reserve
requirements to be more effective as a supplement to other monetary instruments. In
particular, the practice that required reserves are kept in separate CRR accounts should be changed.
Banks should have only one account with the RMA which should be used to meet the reserve
requirements as well as serving as an ordinary settlement account. Having one current account in
RMA would also make it possible to allow banks to meet the reserve requirement on average over
the maintenance period. The averaging mechanism would provide more flexibility in banks’ liquidity
management and reduce the demand for excess reserves. In an averaging system, individual banks
may draw on their reserve account in case of unexpected liquidity needs, but they would then have
to overfulfill later in order to meet the requirement. This gives the banks more responsibility and
incentive to manage their own liquidity more actively, which in itself is a precondition for improving
the monetary transmission mechanism. The current practice that the RMA makes the posting on the
banks’ reserve account will become unnecessary. At the present relatively low level of the reserve
ratio (5 per cent), this is now a good opportunity to make the change. Should the ratio increase in
the future, the averaging provision could be combined with a minimum daily requirement in order
to limit the potential for a large reserve drawdown on any given day. This floor could be lowered as
experience with the new system increases. At the end of the maintenance period, non-fulfillment
should be penalized.
79.
Reserve requirements are an effective but a blunt instrument which should be used
with care. The RMA has (understandably) actively used changes in the reserve ratio in response to
tight liquidity resulting from the measures taken in March 2012 to deal with the rupee shortage.28
The RMA should in the future avoid frequent and large changes in the cash reserve ratio, as this can
be disruptive for financial intermediation. Changes in the reserve ratio have a direct impact on the
money multiplier and reserve requirements generally serve as a tax on financial intermediation,
which may result in wider spreads between retail deposit and lending rates. As the reliance on
28

The reserve ratio was reduced from 17 percent to 10 percent in March 2012 and further to 5 percent in June 2012.

36

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BHUTAN

market-based instruments in liquidity management increases, large and frequent changes in the
reserve requirement should not be necessary.
80.
The application of sweeping is an administrative tool for direct regulation of liquidity
and should not be used as a general liquidity instrument as alternative tools are developed.
Future use of this arrangement should be analyzed and clarified in cooperation with commercial
banks. Although the arrangement can serve a useful purpose, namely to sterilize huge, very shortterm and potential destabilizing funds in connection with the hydro-power projects, the selection of
accounts could be reviewed.
81.
With a stronger focus on short-term liquidity management, the RMA should consider
introducing a short-term standing lending facility. The RSTLAW is much too long term, and
banks need to become more active and responsive in their short-term liquidity management. Many
central banks have introduced an overnight standing facility, which allows banks to borrow funds
overnight. The arrangement should normally not be extended beyond overnight, to give banks
incentive to repay any outstanding balances in the morning when the interbank market opens. As it
will take time to develop an interbank market in Bhutan, the short-term facility could be extended
to, say, one week. To encourage banks to first try to find the funds needed from other banks before
making use of the central bank facility, the short-term loan facility should be offered at a reasonably
penal interest rate relative to the cost of borrowing in the interbank market. This interest rate on the
facility should be determined by the RMA, and it will normally form the ceiling for the interbank
market rate. The purpose of the facility is therefore to induce banks to take a reasonable risk in their
liquidity management which will help to increase activity in the short-term money market and
reduce interest rate volatility. Access to the RMA standing loan facility would be at the discretion of
the banks that have appropriate collateral. It is important that occasional use of this facility should
be considered as a normal part of a bank’s liquidity management, and no stigma should be attached
to frequent drawings.
82.
It should be emphasized that the standing lending facilities are meant only to provide
very short-term liquidity support. Banks with longer-term liquidity problems or structural liquidity
needs in the banking system should be addressed through other measures. The RMA should
consider the need for introducing a properly designed Lender-of-Last-Resort (LoLR) facility for
banks that are faced with longer-term liquidity problems. The already existing RSTLAW, which can
extend credit up to 90 days in the form of an overdraft, could perhaps serve such purpose in the
meantime should the need arise.29 LoLR support should not be considered as part of monetary
policy implementation, although the liquidity effects of longer-term support have to be taken into
account.

29

To grant commercial banks an overdraft facility in the central bank, for any period, is unusual. Standing facilities
should be available for covering unexpected short-term liquidity needs; 90 days are in the context of short-term
liquidity management much too long.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

37

BHUTAN

83.
Many central banks have also introduced a standing deposit facility to provide an
interest rate floor in the interbank market. As a standing facility, banks can deposit any excess
funds overnight at their discretion. Similar to the overnight lending facility, the interest rate on the
deposit facility should have a penalty element in the form of a low rate and be lower than the
deposit rates offered in the interbank market. This should discourage its use and provide incentive
to first try to place available funds in the interbank market. The need for a standing deposit facility is
not pressing in Bhutan, but such a facility would in due course assist monetary policy in case of a
sudden capital inflow by preventing interest rates from falling significantly (and in this respect be an
alternative to sweeping). The cost of these operations has to be kept in mind, as the RMA would
need to pay interest on all excess reserves. A standing deposit facility will only become relevant
when the RMA is able to manage the banking system liquidity in such a way that the use of the
standing facilities would be for marginal funds only. The RMA should consider introduction of these
tools in the context of a broader package aimed at fostering market development and effective
monetary policy implementation.
84.
As part of a more market-based monetary policy framework, some increased flexibility
also in the foreign exchange market should be considered. Banks could—as in India—be
allowed to determine the exchange rate for transactions with their retail customers within the
margin prescribed by the RMA. Allowing banks to compete on price for attracting foreign currency
transactions is necessary to create a more competitive environment. Banks should also be allowed to
sell foreign exchange a bit cheaper as part of their overall banking relations with their customers.
Also, the foreign exchange transactions between the RMA and the commercial banks should not be
at mid-rate and available at all times. As a start, the RMA should provide a daily window (at a fixed
time) with a buy and sell rate around a parity rate of the USD/Nu rate determined on the basis of
the US$/INR market rate. This would give banks an incentive to obtain a better price from each
other. At a later stage, the RMA should only open the window on a few predetermined days during
the week. A functioning inter-bank market is internationally the main mechanism for facilitating an
efficient distribution of foreign exchange from institutions with a surplus to institutions with a
deficit. Giving banks incentives to become more responsive and active also in this area will support
the orientation toward a more effective implementation of monetary policy. This established
practice of stable interest rates appears to have contributed to the build-up of substantial maturity
and interest rate mismatches on banks’ balance sheets.

D. Strengthening Monetary Transmission
Present Situation
85.
The transmission of interest rates is currently weak in Bhutan. Despite large swings in
banking system liquidity and macro-economic developments, banks’ retail deposit and lending rates
have remain remarkable stable (see Figure 13). Although banks are in principle free to determine
their interest rates, there appears to have been limited attempts to make adjustments in their

38

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BHUTAN

portfolios by changing their interest rates.30 As discussed earlier, there has also been very limited
impact on bank funding costs coming from monetary policy instruments, such as Treasury bills (see
Figure 14).

Discussion and Recommendations
86.
Liquidity management should aim at influencing the functioning of money and
securities markets. This would strengthen the transmission channel through interest rates and pave
the way for changes in the rates determined by the central bank (policy rates) having an effect on
the economy through changes in bank retail interest rates and asset prices. A reasonably
competitive and responsive banking sector is necessary in order for interest rates to respond to
changing market conditions so that the allocation of funds from savers to debtors in the retail
market is influenced in the desired direction. Usually, there are two important interest rate
transmission mechanisms. The first goes from the policy rate to the interest rates in the wholesale
interbank and Treasury bill markets. As these interest rate changes are influencing the banks’ cost of
funds, the second channel will lead to adjustments in banks’ retail deposit and lending rates. By
integrating the two channels, the transmission of monetary policy decisions would become
significantly stronger. The challenge for most central banks trying to influence interest rate
transmission through changes in the policy rate is to have a liquidity management framework that
ensures short-term market interest rates are determined close to the policy rate. It is also important
in a fixed exchange rate regime that changes in the policy rate can be used to correct market
interest rates from diverting too much from the interest rate of the anchor currency.
87.
Developing these transmission channels in Bhutan will take some time, particularly as
banks’ current lending practices should be changed. Because banks mostly lend medium to long

40

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BHUTAN

term at fixed interest rates, a tightening of monetary policy with corresponding increase in funding
costs will have a first-round effect of declining profits and perhaps capital depletion. The effect on
bank lending and on overall demand would be stronger if interest rates on existing loans could be
adjusted, and not only the interest rate on new loans.
88.
In practical terms, liquidity management should attempt to ensure stability in bank
reserves in order to establish a link between quantities (bank reserves) and the price of
reserves (market interest rates). Large volatility in banks’ reserves makes liquidity planning by
banks difficult and without a consistent framework to absorb large swings in liquidity flows, it will be
difficult to establish an interbank market. In addition to monitoring and forecasting the supply of
reserves, the approach must also be to determine banks’ demand for reserves and “true” excess
reserves (or surplus reserves).
89.
For Bhutan, the demand for bank reserves is primarily linked to the banks’ need to
meet the reserve requirement (CRR) and the liquidity requirements (SLR). The latter is unusual
as banks normally will meet prudential liquidity requirements with other interest bearing assets
rather than unremunerated current accounts at the central bank. A credible Treasury bill program, as
discussed earlier, should provide more appropriate assets for meeting the SLR in the future. In any
event, banks often may want to hold additional reserves over the legally required minimum (CRR or
SLR) for clearing purposes and other contingencies. This portion of banks’ reserves is often referred
to as banks’ “own demand” for reserves. Banks’ own demand cannot be directly observed, but has to
be estimated or critically assessed in some manner. Surveys can be used as a starting point to
capture banks’ expressed preferences, but they should be supplemented by frequent contacts with
individual banks. In a liquidity framework with a focus on bank reserves, it will be necessary to
manage “true” excess reserves (also referred to as surplus reserves), which is the residual portion
above statutory requirement and banks’ own demand.
90.
In order for the link between banks’ reserves and market interest rates to work
efficiently, the market for bank reserves should be in approximate balance. Any “surplus
reserves” held beyond the demand for reserves will then become particularly important for liquidity
management. A rise (decline) in surplus reserves will normally induce banks to expand (reduce) their
balance sheets and to lend more (less) on the interbank market, putting downward (upward)
pressure on short-term interest rates. An analysis of the interrelationship between the level of
surplus reserves and interest rates will become important in a monetary regime with interest rates as
the operating variable.

CONCLUSION
91.
Notwithstanding substantial progress with key financial reforms, recent experience
has shown that Bhutan needs a comprehensive strategy for deepening and broadening the
financial sector. Accomplishments have included new entry into banking and insurance,
amendment of the Royal Monetary Authority (RMA) Act and passage of the Financial Services Act,
and improved financial infrastructure including a new payments system, credit bureau, and collateral

registry. However, financial institutions’ risk management has not kept pace with the five-fold
increase in credit/GDP in the last decade, and assets are not available for liquidity management or
investment diversification. Growing liquidity and interest rate mismatches need to be addressed by
the regulatory framework. Furthermore, there is a risk that ad hoc measures may create uncertainty,
increase vulnerabilities, and impede financial sector development.
92.
A comprehensive Financial Sector Development Strategy (FSDS) is needed aimed at
improving the ability of the financial system to contribute to long-term economic growth by
channeling savings efficiently to productive investments in a sound and stable financial
environment and by providing opportunities to smooth consumption and manage risk. A
broader range of financial assets is needed, most importantly government debt with a range of
maturities to provide a benchmark yield curve, but also public and private equity, corporate bonds,
and micro-finance. Monetary policy could be made more effective by developing financial markets,
starting with an interbank market and short-term securities market and continuing with government
and corporate bond markets. It must be a joint responsibility of the MoF and RMA to promote the
development of a short-term securities market. The strategy would also strengthen regulation and
supervision while broadening access to the financial system of excluded groups. It would encompass
a detailed, prioritized, and sequenced action plan to address gaps and vulnerabilities while
deepening and broadening in the financial system and would benefit from consultation with
relevant stakeholders. It is recommended that the strategy forms part of a masterplan that would
also include a financial sector review and diagnostic covering both the bank and non-bank financial
sectors and the establishment of a mechanism to monitor the implementation of the strategy and
coordinate technical assistance.
93.
There are also opportunities for enhancing affordable access to financial services, in
the context of the authorities’ Financial Inclusion Policy; identified priority areas for strengthening of
regulation and supervision of banks and non-banks; recommended measures to enhance monetary
operations and monetary transmission; and suggested areas for future technical assistance.

Statement by the Staff Representative on Bhutan
Executive Board Meeting
June 20, 2014

1.
This supplement to the staff report summarizes the main developments since the
staff report was issued on June 2, 2014. Staff projections and the thrust of the staff
appraisal remain unchanged.


Credit growth increased slightly to 8.3 percent (year on year) in March 2014 from
7.5 percent in December 2013. Private sector credit grew at an average annual rate
of 30 percent during 2002–11. However, administrative measures to slow credit
growth had resulted in a deceleration of private sector credit growth before its
recent slight increase (March 2014).



International reserves increased from US$ 931 million in December 2013 to
US$ 965 million in March 2014. Reserve cover remains at over 10 months of
imports, suggesting an overall adequate level of reserves.



Inflation in Bhutan is projected to remain elevated given the recent reading of
inflation in India (CPI inflation rose by 8.3 percent in May in India) and the
findings of staff analysis that inflation in Bhutan is closely related to Indian
inflation (see Box 2 in the Bhutan staff report).



Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi reaffirmed India’s commitment to extensive
development cooperation with Bhutan (both hydropower-related and non-hydro aid)
during his June 14–15 visit and committed to further enhancing the economic ties
between the two countries (via expanding bilateral trade, for example).

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund

Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with Bhutan
On June 20, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with Bhutan.
GDP growth in Bhutan has slowed from around 10 percent in Fiscal Year (FY) 2011(July 1June 30) to 5 percent in FY2013. Slower growth reflects policy efforts to contain overheating
pressures in the form of restrictions on credit for construction and vehicle. Inflation has
remained elevated, tracking closely that of India (Bhutan’s main trading partner). Social
development indicators have improved steadily, and Bhutan is on track or has achieved most of
its Millennium Development Goals. The fiscal deficit worsened sharply in FY2013 due to a
shortfall in grants. The current account deficit has widened due to hydropower-related imports,
as well as a consumption and housing boom. Nonetheless, robust aid inflows (loans and grants)
have led to a positive overall balance of payments position, enabling the continued accumulation
of international reserves. External pressures have led to a recurrent shortfall in Indian rupee
reserves.
Growth is projected to recover to 6½ percent in FY2014, driven mainly by a pick-up in
hydropower-related construction activities and domestic services. In addition, policy measures
to revive the economy, including a capital infusion as a part of an Economic Stimulus Package,

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A
staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country's economic
developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board.

are likely to exert a modest positive impact on growth. The current account deficit is projected
to widen further to around 25 percent in 2013/14 due to stronger hydro-related imports but
financing from India and other development partners in the forms of loans and grants is
expected to be adequate. The fiscal deficit is budgeted to remain high in 2013/14.
Risks stem from high debt levels and the possible surfacing of financial sector vulnerabilities
following a prolonged period of rapid credit growth. There is also a risk of renewed external
pressures, including pressures on rupee reserves, if macro policies remain expansionary and
credit growth rebounds strongly. Additionally, risks emanate from slower growth in India—
including due to financial market volatility—though these risks are mitigated by the
concentration of exports in the hydropower sector, which enjoys healthy demand from India.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed Bhutan’s continuing progress driven by hydropower development,
which has led to robust economic growth and much improved social indicators. However, they
noted that rapid economic growth and credit expansion had led to overheating pressures in the
past and to continued deterioration in the current account balance. While the expansion of
hydropower capacity offers good medium-term economic growth prospects, Directors
encouraged the authorities to carefully manage macroeconomic pressures and to continue to
diversify the economy to reduce economic volatility, create more jobs, and enhance
inclusiveness.
Directors recommended tightening fiscal policy to preserve macroeconomic stability and contain
public debt. They considered that revenue reforms are essential to achieve greater fiscal
self-reliance over the medium term and support critical social and infrastructure spending. They
noted the need for measures to widen the tax net in the near term and to consider introducing a
value-added tax over the medium term. Improved fiscal management and public spending
efficiency, including prioritizing expenditures to mitigate the risk of grant shortfalls, and better
cash forecasting will also be crucial.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive
Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can
be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

3
Directors considered that monetary policy should complement a tighter fiscal stance by curbing
the build-up of excess liquidity and sterilizing large capital inflows. They noted that more regular
and increased issuance of treasury bills would help liquidity management, deepen financial
markets, and improve monetary transmission.
Directors recommended strengthening bank supervision and regulation, including by regular
stress testing and closing regulatory gaps, and putting in place institutional arrangements
including crisis management and deposit insurance. Directors looked forward to the preparation
of Bhutan’s Financial Sector Development Strategy.
Given Bhutan’s close economic relationship with India, Directors agreed that the peg to the
Indian rupee has served Bhutan well and remains an appropriate nominal anchor. They saw merit
in closer alignment of reserve currency composition with the structure of external liabilities
through a gradual increase in the share of Indian rupees in overall reserves. A few Directors
noted that the authorities’ reserves adequacy framework has a threshold for changing convertible
currencies to rupees when conditions are favorable.
Directors took note of the staff’s assessment that the real exchange rate is overvalued. They
encouraged the authorities to make progress on structural reforms, including reducing skills
mismatches in the labor market and increasing access to finance particularly for small and
medium enterprises, to boost competitiveness, create jobs, and help diversify the economy.
Directors encouraged elimination of exchange restrictions subject to approval under Article VIII
and the restrictions maintained under Article XIV as soon as macroeconomic conditions allow.

Statement by Mr. Rakesh Mohan, Executive Director for Bhutan
and Mr. Muneesh Kapur, Advisor to Executive Director
June 20, 2014
1.
On behalf of our authorities, we thank the staff for a comprehensive and wellwritten report, which reflects a strong understanding of the economic dynamics and
macroeconomic challenges faced by Bhutan. Our authorities appreciate the Mission's
hard work and diligence in discussing the issues with Bhutanese authorities in a
collaborative manner, for their efforts to include and cover issues of importance to the
authorities, and for providing assistance with requests for technical assistance and in
institutional capacity building. Our authorities broadly share the staff’s assessment.
Recent Economic Developments
2.
The Bhutanese economy recorded strong growth during the 10th Plan (2008-13).
Real GDP growth averaged 8 percent during this period, buoyed by electricity,
construction and services activity. Strong growth, along with other inclusive policies,
pushed down poverty from 23 percent in 2007 to 12 percent in 2012. The unemployment
rate dropped from 3.1 percent in 2011 to 2.1 percent in 2012.
3.
Strong growth over the 10th Plan period, however, also led to external imbalances
and was accompanied by high credit growth. In response to some signs of overheating,
the authorities implemented monetary policy and prudential measures to rein in aggregate
demand. Accordingly, real GDP growth in Bhutan slowed during 2012 to 4.6 percent
from 8.6 percent during the previous year.
4.
The hydropower sector remains a key sector of economic activity – construction
and electricity sub-sectors constitute almost one-fourth of GDP. Hydropower sector and
related growth has, however, slowed down in recent years due to the plateauing of
production, which has also contributed to the deceleration in growth in the recent years.
Electricity and related growth can be expected to pick-up in 2016-17, when the next
project starts production. This will lead to a spike in the growth rate in 2016-17; given the
bulky nature of these projects, such spikes have occurred in the past and can be expected
to occur in the future as well. Efforts are underway to increase the power generation
capacity from the current level of 1500 MW to 10,000 MW by 2020, predominantly with
support from India. The hydropower sector is expected to start adding to growth
momentum, as the new capacity starts production.
5.
The power generated from the existing and the prospective hydropower plants
will be largely sold to India. Concomitantly, the import requirements associated with
these power plants are expected to maintain pressure on the current account deficit during
the construction stage of these projects; however, financing of such deficits is not an
issue. The current account position is expected to move from deficit to surplus, once
these projects start production. Similarly, the public debt as well as external debt position
will improve significantly, as the various hydropower projects start generation.

6.
Continued expansion in the hydropower sector is critical for socio-economic
development; however, given the strong possibility of further harnessing of hydropower
potential beyond the 10,000 MW target by 2020, sequencing of these investments and
negotiation of project modalities is critical.
7.
Consumer price inflation moderated from 13.5 percent in 2012:Q2 to 5.5 percent
in 2013:Q2, reflecting easing in both food and non-food inflation; it has since then,
however, edged again up to 11.3 percent in 2013:Q4, largely due to upward pressures in
food-related prices. The RMA continues to maintain a tight monetary policy stance and
has launched new initiatives and macro prudential policies to strengthen financial sector
regulation and supervision under the scope of a Financial Sector Development Strategy.
8.
The fiscal deficit remained modest and decreased slightly from 1.2 percent of
GDP in 2011-12 to 1 percent of GDP in 2012-13.
External Sector Management
9.
As noted earlier, strong growth during the 10th Plan period was, inter alia,
mirrored in widening current account deficits. In response, the authorities put in place
demand management measures as also some temporary restrictions on selected imports in
2011-2012. Accordingly, there was a modest reduction in the merchandise trade deficit.
Nevertheless, the current account deficit widened to 25 percent of GDP in 2012-13 from
23 percent of GDP in 2011-12 due to reduced inflows in budgetary grants. As of March
2014, Bhutan’s international reserves were USD 965 million, providing a cover for 22
months of merchandise imports.
10.
While the overall balance of payments (BoP) position has recorded modest
deficits or surpluses in recent years, the BoP position with India has recorded persistent
deficits. This reflects the heavy dependence of the economy on India to meet its import
requirements amidst high domestic demand. Thus, while there is a deficit BoP position
with regard to India, there is a surplus BoP position with respect to other countries. This
has created challenges for the authorities to raise Indian rupee (INR) resources, even
though overall foreign exchange reserves are equivalent to 22 months of merchandise
imports.
11.
During 2012 and 2013, the Royal Monetary Authority (RMA) also took steps to
address volatility in the external sector and pressures on Rupee reserves. The RMA
entered into an INR Swap arrangement with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and raised
INR 5.4 billion in March 2013 for 6 months; the Swap was liquidated in September 2013.
In addition, USD 200 million was sold against INR in June 2013 to raise INR resources,
in light of a comfortable convertible currency reserve position and favorable exchange
rate conditions. The authorities continue to be vigilant on external sector developments.
Overall, given strong trade and economic ties with India, the currency peg to the INR has
served Bhutan well.

Reserve Adequacy Issues
12.
On reserve adequacy and management [Selected Issues - Chapter 2], staff
estimates that if Bhutan had invested on average 30 percent of its reserves in INR
denominated government bonds, it would have earned net interest of INR 4 billion in
2005-12 period. Second, staff notes that the actual interest cost of INR overdraft facilities
to which the RMA resorted to periodically has added to the cost of holding convertible
currency reserves. Finally, staff recommends that the currency composition of reserves
should be more aligned with the structure of Bhutan’s external liabilities and trade, with
consideration being given to a gradual increase in the share of INR reserves. To begin
with, staff recommends any excess of convertible currency reserves a certain nominal
threshold should be converted into rupees and managed in a liquidity portfolio.
13.
In this context, we may note that staff’s estimates of interest earnings foregone are
unlikely to be realized, since INR funds would need to be maintained in the most liquid
form (under the reserve management policy) to meet daily payment obligations which are
very unpredictable in nature. Moreover, the currency composition of reserves reflects the
fact that (i) reserves build up is largely due to aid inflows; (ii) Bhutan has sizable
convertible currency payment obligations largely denominated in USD; (iii) since INR is
a non-convertible currency, it is more efficient to keep reserves in USD terms and
convert them into rupees as and when needed. Besides, as staff acknowledge, Bhutan is
also bound by the Constitutional requirement of an import cover of 12 months in foreign
currency.
14.
The RMA has a Reserve Management Policy and is developing guidelines. This
process has benefited from the Fund TA on Reserves Management. The RMA has
developed and is implementing its Reserve Adequacy Framework with a threshold limit,
beyond which RMA shall convert its convertible currency reserves and increase Rupee
reserves as and when conditions are favorable. The value of the threshold can be
expected to change from time to time in line with economic conditions and pattern of
financial flows. It should, therefore, be treated as an element of RMA’s internal
operational framework and it would be inappropriate to mention a specific nominal
threshold.
15.
Bhutan has prudential restrictions on the foreign exchange usage and the
authorities avail of the transitional arrangements under Article XIV, section 2. Our
authorities have followed prudent foreign exchange policies so as to safeguard
international reserves which serve as the foundation of Bhutan's macroeconomic and
exchange rate policy and to support sustainable development. Bhutan's reserves have
been accumulated over the past 5 decades through gradual inflows of aid and debt as
opposed to export performance. Until such time Bhutan’s macroeconomic fundamentals
do not improve, removing exchange measures would not be prudent. The current INR
exchange restrictions related to the import of vehicles and construction materials (in line
with credit controls) since 2012 are temporary and the RMA has plans to remove these
restrictions this year in line with the introduction of fiscal measures by the Royal
Government.

16.
During the year, Bhutan started disseminating BoP and international investment
position (IIP) statistics, including quarterly statistics, compiled under IMF’s Balance of
Payments Manual 6th Edition (BPM6). Successful migration of Bhutan’s BOP to BPM6
was carried out under the IMF TA and Japan Subaccount (JSA) Project on the
Improvement of External Sector Statistics (ESS) in the Asia and Pacific Region. This
makes Bhutan one of the first Asian countries and IMF Member nations to implement the
BPM6 framework on a quarterly basis and ensures international comparability of
Bhutan’s BOP statistics.
Financial Sector
17.
Financial soundness indicators for Bhutan remain generally comfortable, with
capital adequacy and liquidity well above the required prudential norms, although the
proportion of non-performing loans has increased in the recent period. In order to
strengthen the regulatory system, the central bank has recently supplemented its microprudential regulations with a macro-prudential system to make the Bhutanese financial
system more resilient. Macro-prudential regulations covering counter-cyclical capital
buffers, sectoral capital requirements, leverage ratio, loan to value and loan to income
ratios, debt to equity ratio, time-varying capital provisioning and margin requirement and
profit distribution are being put in place. These macro-prudential regulations, in
conjunction with the existing micro-prudential regulations, are expected to foster
financial stability in an environment of continued financial deepening amidst high
growth.
18.
To promote lending to productive and priority economic sectors, the Government
is implementing an Economic Stimulus Plan (ESP) from 2014. Under the ESP, INR 5
billion secured by the Government as grant support outside of the 11th Five Year Plan
(FYP) (2013-18) from the government of India (GoI) is being injected into the financial
institutions to improve financial sector liquidity levels and lending.
19.
A Central Registry for Movable Property was established in September 2013,
which has helped the RMA facilitate smooth credit appraisal. As part of its strategy to
contain over-exposure of financial institutions towards select credit portfolios and to
regulate rapid credit expansion, the RMA adjusted prudential provisions pertaining to
loan provisioning, risk weight limits during 2012 and 2013.
Capacity Development and Small States
20.
Our authorities are highly appreciative of the Fund for providing opportunities for
enhancing human resource capacities through training and technical assistance (TA).
During 2013, Bhutan benefitted tremendously from TAs in the areas of National
Accounts Statistics, Treasury Management, Financial Sector Surveillance, Balance of
Payments (External Sector Statistics), and Foreign Exchange and Reserve Management.
Notably, as noted earlier, Bhutan has become one of the success stories in enhancing
compilation and quality of BoP and IIP statistics.

21.
Our authorities would like to request the Fund to explicitly support Bhutan in its
need for continued external resource support and assistance when pursuing these reforms.
As the staff projections indicate, Bhutan's level of official development assistance is
expected to decline gradually in line with improvements in per capita income. However,
as the staff assessment shows, growth in Bhutan has been driven primarily on the back of
a single sector (hydropower development) which generates limited employment. Bhutan
continues to remain an import and aid-dependent country. To strengthen economic
fundamentals, and to pursue economic diversification, Bhutan will continue to rely on the
goodwill and assistance from its key multilateral development partners including the
IMF, World Bank and ADB.
Outlook
22.
Bhutan has achieved noteworthy progress in recent years. The poverty rate has
been reduced from 32 percent in 2003 to 12 percent in 2012. The authorities are working
towards self reliance and reducing dependence on external assistance by 2020.
Notwithstanding the creditable progress achieved in social indicators and robust growth
performance during the 10th FYP period (2008-13), the authorities recognize that Bhutan
faces numerous structural weaknesses and challenges that need close attention to ensure
long term sustainability. The economy can no longer be sustained on the back of a single
economic sector, although hydropower development remains a vital catalyst for socioeconomic development.
23.
The 11th Five Year Plan, covering the period 2013-14 to 2017-18, envisages
average annual growth of 12 percent as compared with that of 8 percent in the 10th Plan.
As the 11th Plan notes, the macroeconomic challenges of recent years underscore the need
to prudently address various issues in the real, external and monetary sectors. In this
regard, the prudent management and use of hydropower inflows will be critical in the
long-run; in the short-to-medium-term, our authorities recognize that managing the
spillovers from the hydropower sector and related activities during the gestation period of
these projects on INR reserves will be important for macroeconomic and financial
stability.
