EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Discussions focused on the policy mix needed to contain the impact of global turmoil,
especially on the financial sector, and keep the U.A.E. economy on a path of sustainable
growth with single-digit inflation.
The authorities
•

Explained their approach is to preserve financial stability through various emergency
liquidity facilities, guarantee of deposits, and a strengthening of banking supervision.

•

Expect public spending to remain a key driver for growth in 2008–09, including
through higher transfers to quasi-public entities to replace foreign and domestic bank
lending.

•

Agreed that the dirham might be moderately undervalued.

•

Consider that the current pegged regime remains appropriate at this juncture,
providing a strong anchor in the current turmoil.

Staff recommendations
•

Slow credit growth while avoiding too abrupt a slowdown to avoid damage to
corporates and the financial system. In the event of a worse-than-expected downturn,
target contingency measures to safeguard systemically important institutions.

•

The peg to the U.S. dollar remains appropriate unless inflation were unexpectedly to
persist.

•

Minimize fiscal costs of the government guarantees; ensure adequate incentives to
prevent banks from using the new liquidity facilities to acquire more risky assets.

•

Rationalize subsidies and prioritize investment projects with a view to alleviate
supply bottlenecks and inflation pressures; be ready to pursue a more active
counter-cyclical fiscal policy if needed.

•

Complete ongoing work to disseminate monthly CPI data, establish a National
Bureau of Statistics, and improve national accounts and public sector statistics,
including preparation and publication of the IIP.

I. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND SHORT-TERM PROSPECTS 1
1.
The United Arab Emirates’ (U.A.E.) economy continued to perform strongly in
2007 and the first nine months of 2008. The government’s outward-oriented development
strategy and high international oil and gas prices boosted domestic and foreign investment,
and led to strong growth in the construction and services sectors. However, as a worsening
global environment started to take a toll in the second half of 2008, non-oil growth is
projected to ease to 8.6 percent in 2008. Budget and external current account surpluses
remained large in 2007 (25 and 16 percent of GDP, respectively) and are projected to remain
at similar levels in 2008, with higher oil exports offset by increases in government imports.
2.
Inflationary pressures are likely to ease in coming months, and managing the
vulnerabilities arising from the global downturn has become the key policy challenge.
•

Inflation has steadily accelerated since 2004 and is projected to reach
12.7 percent in 2008, reflecting housing shortages, imported inflation, U.S. dollar
depreciation, and strong domestic demand fuelled also by the expansionary monetary
policy imported from the United States through the dollar peg. However, in the
second half of 2008, the sharp appreciation of the U.S. dollar and declining global
food and commodity prices have put downward pressures on tradables prices and
should help ease inflation going forward. Reflecting relatively high inflation, the real
effective exchange rate has been appreciating steadily since end-2004.

•

The U.A.E. has been adversely affected by the turmoil in global financial
markets, as evident in a widening of sovereign risk spreads and a sharp downturn in
stock markets—most pronounced for real estate companies. Capital inflows driven by
expectations of a revaluation of the dirham vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar largely reversed
over the summer of 2008; currency futures indicate that markets no longer doubt the
peg. Anecdotal evidence suggests that foreign financing for corporates has tightened,
and a slowdown in real estate and construction seems underway.

3.
The U.A.E. banking system appears adequately capitalized and highly
profitable, but risks of a future deterioration of asset quality have risen. Banks’ assets
and profits increased sharply in 2007 and the capital adequacy ratio stood at 13.3 percent by
mid-2008, above the regulatory minimum of 10 percent, though somewhat below the level of
2007. However, the fast pace of growth of consumer and real estate loans along with the
uncertain outlook for asset prices has raised the risk of a future increase in nonperforming
loans (NPLs). Recent capital outflows, and growing concerns about counterparty risk have in
recent months affected the functioning of the interbank market (see below).

4.
Money and private sector credit growth accelerated further in the first nine
months of 2008, and liquidity problems emerged in late summer. Credit to the private
sector rose by 51 percent (y-o-y) in September 2008, up from 40 percent in December 2007,
driven by the economic boom and highly negative real interest rates. Credit was financed by
strong deposit growth, but in 2007 also by large foreign borrowing. Since March 2008, the
central bank has taken several steps to address a drying-up of liquidity following an outflow
of foreign deposits. 2 To preempt spillovers from the global turmoil and address continued
liquidity pressures in the banking system, the government declared in October 2008 a blanket
guarantee of deposits and inter-bank

In March 2008, a facility allowing banks to borrow against their holdings of central bank certificates of
deposit (CDs) replaced foreign borrowing as a key source of funding. In September, the central bank established
an additional $13.6 billion facility to offset shortfalls in other bank funding sources, allowing banks to tap their
reserve requirements at a penalty rate of 1.5 percent above the repo rate.

II. MEDIUM-TERM ECONOMIC OUTLOOK
5.
Discussions were based on a staff scenario projecting growth to slow to about 3 percent
in 2009 on the back of the worsened global outlook, before gradually recovering to around 5
percent during 2010–13. This reflects a slower expansion in the non-oil sector, particularly in
tourism and construction, as domestic and foreign demand growth is expected to weaken in the near
future. Migration into the U.A.E. is also expected to ease with slower growth. Oil production is
expected to expand gradually to about 3.39 million barrels per day by 2013, with oil prices gradually
recovering to around $86 per barrel. Inflation is expected to decelerate to about 3 percent by 2013 as
demand pressures and international commodity price inflation ease.
6.
Fiscal and external balances are projected to remain in surplus over the medium-term,
despite lower oil prices. The non-oil fiscal deficit is expected to narrow to 29 percent of non-oil
GDP over the medium-term, while the current account surplus would reach 15 percent of GDP by
2013. It would take a fall in oil prices to below $53 per barrel before the current account would show
a deficit in 2009.
7.
The short and medium-term outlook is subject to a number of downside risks arising
from the difficult global environment as well as domestic financial vulnerabilities in the wake of
the recent real estate and credit boom (especially in Dubai):
•

a more severe global weakening could further reduce non-oil growth through much lower oil
prices, and through lower global demand for construction, tourism and financial and traderelated services.

•

foreign financing for ongoing and planned investment projects may be scaled back further,
and the refinancing of corporates’ foreign debt could become more complicated.

•

corporates (as well as households) will likely scale down investment plans for the next few
years but demand for domestic financing will increase—if only to complete ongoing
projects—at a time when domestic banks are already under stress.

•

these developments could trigger a correction in the real estate market (Box 1), and thereby a
deterioration of asset quality in the financial system.

•

while the fiscal position (especially of Abu Dhabi) remains strong, and the willingness of the
authorities to provide coordinated federal support for corporates and the banking system has
been underscored by the latest liquidity-initiative, the scope for fiscal support could become
more constrained if oil prices decline further or if the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority
(ADIA) and other institutions experience further sharp declines in the value of their external
assets.

•

inflationary pressures could recur if there were, for example, a renewed sharp depreciation of
the U.S. dollar, or an acceleration of global food price inflation.

III. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
8.
The turmoil in global financial markets poses significant challenges to the U.A.E.
economy, although some officials expect a more limited impact on growth. The policy
discussions focused on the modalities of the authorities’ recent intervention in financial markets, and
the fiscal, monetary and financial policy mix needed to contain the impact of global turmoil and keep
the U.A.E. economy on a path of sustainable growth with single-digit inflation.
A. Monetary and Financial Sector Issues
9.
The authorities introduced the blanket guarantee and emergency liquidity facilities to
prevent any destabilization of the U.A.E.’s financial system. Access to the first tranche of the
$19.1 billion liquidity facility was conditional on bank recipients limiting the growth of private sector
credit to key areas, avoiding lending for new real estate projects and speculative activities or
financing activities outside the U.A.E. The authorities aim to slow annual private sector credit growth
to about 10–15 percent.
10.
An abrupt slowdown in the domestic real estate market poses the main risk to the
banking system. Direct exposure to U.S. mortgage-related securities is reportedly small, and official
data indicate limited exposure to the domestic real estate market. Staff pointed however to FSAP
concerns about the accuracy of the sectoral classification, and wondered about possible indirect
exposure, especially with respect to some off-balance sheet commitments that may materialize
rapidly in case of a real estate market downturn. The authorities consider that the U.A.E.’s banks
have enough buffers (capital, reserves and earnings) to absorb losses that could result from a local
real estate correction, which many market participants expect to be in the order of 20–30 percent. If
needed, the authorities would consider targeted capital injections for weaker banks.
11.
The central bank of the U.A.E. (CBU) is taking steps to strengthen banking supervision
to contain the fiscal risks related to the emergency liquidity facilities. This involves evaluating
banks’ asset portfolios with a focus on real estate loans, and review of the loan classification and
provision regulations to obtain sharper measures of exposures and risks. The CBU has also started to
(a) increase the frequency of regular reporting by banks of liquidity indicators; (b) perform
unscheduled visits to banks; and (c) strengthen the financial stability unit. In line with the 2007 FSAP
recommendations, amendments to the banking law are planned that would strengthen the central
bank’s power to take prompt corrective measures, stiffening penalties for violation of laws and
regulations or unsafe or unsound practices, and providing better legal protection for supervisors.
12.
The development of money market instruments, notably through the issuance of shortterm government paper, would help support liquidity management. The authorities recognized
that supply of the current liquidity management instrument, CBU issued CDs, was inherently
procyclical as it diminishes commercial banks’ liquid asset holdings at the same time as liquidity gets
harder to obtain on the interbank market. Regular issuance of government bills could also reduce

12

(federal and emirate) government reliance on funding from the various sovereign wealth funds
(SWFs) in an economic downturn and in times of low oil prices. The recent issuance of a 5-year
Treasury note to back the $19.1 billion facility could be a first step in this direction. The authorities
are also aiming to develop Sharia-compliant instruments (sovereign sukuks) that would help Islamic
financial institutions manage their liquidity.
B. Inflation
13.
The authorities concurred with staff that inflation is set to recede, due to the appreciation
of the U.S. dollar and declines in global commodity and food prices. Pressures on rents and real
estate prices in Abu Dhabi and Dubai are expected to ease as new housing units come to the market,
while the expected slowdown in the non-oil sector would slow the growth of the expatriate
population, and hence demand for housing.

13

Box 1. Real Estate in the U.A.E.
Development of basic infrastructure, including housing, has been key to the U.A.E.’s
success in becoming an important regional trading and service center. Housing and office
space supply has grown rapidly, and double-digit growth in prices and rents (at least through
September 2008) points to continued strong demand, with continued housing shortages
especially for expatriates.
Demand has been mainly driven by strong population growth (about 6 percent a year),
with about 300,000 new immigration visas with work permits issued each year. The opening of
the real estate market to non-residents has fostered a luxury segment where investors were
often seeking to make capital gains or to take advantage of increasing rents. Negative real
interest rates and loan-to-value rates of up to 95 percent also fuelled the boom.
To slow speculation and rent increases, both Dubai and Abu Dhabi made regulatory
changes. Dubai introduced caps on rent increases in late 2005 and Abu Dhabi in late 2006.
A new mortgage law requires all mortgage contracts to be registered with the land department
and to be insured and sold by registered financial institutions. In addition, major developers
now require off-plan buyers to own 30 percent of their properties before selling them, and
financial institutions now demand larger down payments.
Looking forward, demand growth can be expected to slow along with non-oil growth, with
demand for lower-price housing expected to remain relatively more robust.
A sharp drop in the value of listed real-estate companies (by end-November more than
60 percent from 2008 peaks) indicates that markets expect a substantial correction in real estate
activity and valuations.

C. Fiscal Policy
14.
Fiscal policy has become more expansionary in 2008 and is set to remain so in 2009, with
spending rising sharply as a share of non-oil GDP. Including salary increases that took effect in
2008 at the federal and emirate levels, current and development spending will rise by 2–2½ percent
of non-oil GDP during 2008-09, compared to 2007. The Abu Dhabi government is furthermore
allocating large resources to quasi-public enterprises (e.g. Mubadala) to replace foreign and domestic
bank lending. A 5-percent VAT is planned to be introduced within the next 2–3 years in coordination
with other GCC countries.
15.
The authorities took note of the staff’s recommendations to strengthen coordination of
fiscal policy between the emirates and the federal level, so as to be ready (if needed) to pursue
an even more active countercyclical fiscal policy. The federal authorities indicated that they did not
expect the U.A.E’s growth outlook to deteriorate significantly in view of continued strong growth in
Asia and because they do not see a significant risk of a further sharp decline in oil prices. Pointing at
the quick and coordinated action taken by the federal government and the central bank to provide
liquidity to commercial banks, the authorities indicated that they were ready to step in with all
available tools should the need arise.
16.
The authorities were confident that the financial turmoil should not unduly affect
emirate governments’ ability to meet financing needs. In 2007, Dubai established the Supreme
Fiscal Council to coordinate government entities’ borrowing. All government entities now need to
obtain approval from the Council prior to any debt raising. In April 2008, the Dubai government
completed the issuance of a first tranche of its AED15 billion Medium Term Note program aimed at
financing large infrastructure projects. Given the projected deficits in 2009–10, the financing needs
of Dubai government could reach $8.6 billion by 2010.
17.
Vulnerabilities have emerged also in the non-bank corporate sector, particularly for the
various semi-public corporates of “Dubai Inc.” that depend heavily on foreign financing. The drying
up of foreign financing for corporates is expected to complicate refinancing of existing debt (about
$20 billion is expected to come due through end-2009). Ongoing projects may have to be slowed
down, and new projects, particularly in the real estate sector, be put on hold. The authorities are
working on coordinated support for these corporates, to ensure an orderly “soft landing” and prevent
spillovers to the banking sector.

D. Exchange Rate Policy and Exchange Rate Assessment
18.
The authorities agreed that the dirham appears moderately undervalued (Boxes 2 and
3). However, the U.A.E. needs large surpluses to build up investments to reduce dependency on
volatile and finite oil income. Rising domestic absorption and lower oil prices would reduce current
account surpluses from the current levels. Dollar-appreciation and relatively higher inflation would
meanwhile bring the real exchange rate in line with its equilibrium level in the course of 2009; indeed
there was concern about a possible erosion of competitiveness of the non-oil sector.
19.
The authorities remain committed to the dollar-peg as providing a stable anchor for
inflationary expectations and financial stability. Given recent developments, the authorities felt
vindicated in staying with the dollar-peg. Currency futures indicated that speculation for a
revaluation of the dirham has disappeared. Moreover, the flexibility of labor, prices, and wages—due
to a flexible expatriate workforce—would ensure that any misalignment would be corrected quickly
through price or labor force adjustments.
E. Regional Cooperation
20.
The approval of draft statutes for a Monetary Council (forerunner of a Gulf Central
Bank) by GCC finance ministers and central bank governors in mid-September 2008 has given fresh
impetus to monetary integration among GCC countries. The draft awaits final approval by the heads
of states in December. While a common currency for the GCC is unlikely to be in place by 2010, the
authorities considered that the economic benefits from the steps leading toward the monetary union
(including facilitating capital flows, establishing a common market, and harmonizing regulation)
were important by themselves.
21.
A worsened economic outlook for the U.A.E. could have significant regional spillover
effects by lowering outflows to neighboring countries. The U.A.E.’s weaker growth prospects and
lower oil prices are expected to reduce outflows of remittances and FDI to neighboring countries that

16

have grown in importance in recent years. U.A.E. companies have undertaken major investment
projects in the Middle East and North Africa region and remittances of expatriate workers (nearly
$9 billion in 2007) have been benefiting many economies in the region.

17

Box 2. Exchange Rate Assessment for U.A.E.
Staff estimates using the equilibrium real exchange rate (ERER) approach suggest that
the U.A.E. dirham was moderately undervalued at end- 2007. Staff found evidence of a
long-run cointegration relationship between the dirham REER and key fundamentals (notably
the terms of trade (TOT), government consumption, and real per capita income relative to
trading partners). Since 2003, when the actual REER was broadly in line with the estimated
equilibrium rate, the ERER has been on a rising trend driven mainly by a significant
improvement in the TOT. The actual REER has been appreciating by 11 percent between 2004
and 2007, driven by rising inflation. A remaining gap to the ERER of 6 percent is projected to
vanish over 2009.

The macroeconomic balance (MB) approach indicates that the medium-term current
account (CA) “norm ” is 18.5 percent of GDP, somewhat above the current account balances
projected for 2008–13. The norm is based on panel data estimates for the GCC countries; the
variables used in the estimation of the current account norm include the fiscal balance, net
foreign assets, and the oil balance. The results are robust to enlarging the panel to MCD oil
exporters or all MCD countries, using different estimators, and changing the specification. In
any case, driven mainly by lower import growth, the current account is projected to move
closer into line with fundamentals over the medium term.

18

Box 3. Exchange Rate Assessment Under the External Sustainability Approach
Sustainability of U.A.E.’s current account trajectory requires that today’s net foreign assets plus the
(expected) net present value (NPV) of all future oil income (“wealth”) equal the NPV of imports of
goods and services, net of non-oil exports. Subject to this constraint, policy makers could seek to choose a
path for imports, and hence current account “norm”, that would support intergenerational equity (and provide
a safety cushion if uncertainty over

Under the first two types of annuity
the current account surplus projected
for the coming years will remain
below the “norm”, implying
overvaluation of the U.A.E. dirham.
Only in the third scenario, which leaves
future generations with rapidly
declining benefits from current oil
wealth, is the projected current account
balance broadly in line with the “norm”.

Assuming 99 billion barrel of reserves, a 68 percent recovery rate, oil production to peak at 4.3 million barrel in 2025
before declining by 2¼ percent per annum, with reserves depleted by 2070. To take into account production costs and
domestic consumption, it is assumed that 97 percent of oil revenues could be used in the calculation of the oil wealth.
After 2013, oil prices and the GDP deflator increase annually by 3.5 percent, real GDP by 2.8 percent, and population by
2 percent. Future oil revenues are discounted at (nominal) 6.5 percent, the assumed rate of return on external assets. Initial
financial wealth is estimated at $0.4 trillion.

19

F. Statistics and Other Issues
22.
Efforts to improve statistics have intensified. The U.A.E. officially began participating in
the GDDS on July 31, 2008 and has recently approved a new federal statistics law that would allow
establishment of a National Bureau of Statistics. Plans to disseminate CPI data on a monthly basis
starting in 2009 are on track. The authorities have requested technical assistance from the Fund on
balance of payments data. On the U.A.E.’s international investment position (IIP), the federal
authorities indicated that the individual emirates’ SWFs do not disclose information on their assets,
partly in order to shield long-term investment strategy from politics-driven short-termism. Staff
estimates based on balance of payments flow data suggest the U.A.E.’s aggregate net IIP was on the
order of $600 billion in 2007; the authorities were broadly comfortable with these orders of
magnitude.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
23.
The U.A.E. economy continued to perform strongly in 2007–08, but tough policy
challenges have emerged with the global turmoil. Strong growth, investment, and job-creation
have been aided by the government’s outward-oriented development strategy and high international
oil and gas prices. Budget and external current account surpluses remain large. However, the
worsened global outlook will adversely affect the U.A.E.’s growth momentum through lower oil
prices, tighter access to international finance, and weaker prospects for tourism, trade, and real estate
related activities. The latter sector may be particularly vulnerable in the wake of an unprecedented
credit and asset price boom. With inflationary pressures likely to ease in coming months, managing
the vulnerabilities arising from the global downturn has become the key policy challenge.
24.
The foremost task is to safeguard the soundness and functioning of the financial sector.
While credit growth has to slow from the dangerously high pace in recent years, too abrupt a
slowdown will have to be avoided to contain damage to corporates and the financial system. In the
event of a worse-than-expected downturn, appropriate contingency plans will have to be activated
focusing on safeguarding systemically important institutions. Staff encourages close coordination of
the policy response to the fallout of the global financial turmoil with other GCC countries, inter alia
to prevent regulatory arbitrage.
25.
The government’s blanket guarantee of deposits and inter-bank lending for three years
and various liquidity facilities demonstrate the willingness and capacity of the government to
coordinate action at the federal level. Going forward, the authorities need to minimize the fiscal
costs of the government guarantee, and ensure that safeguards attached to the new facilities are
creating adequate incentives for banks to prevent using the liquidity for a further buildup of risky
assets, while improving disclosure of and provisioning for any emerging nonperforming loans. Staff
welcomes plans to amend the banking law to strengthen the CBU’s supervisory and regulatory
power, and—under the emergency support facility—to monitor and limit the growth of private credit,
particularly for real estate, and to strengthen supervision. Staff also welcomes CBU plans to conduct

20

in the near future a thorough assessment of banks’ balance sheets, as well as off-balance sheet items,
and large exposures. This would delineate, among other things, how and when the government would
intervene if needed, and help quantify the measures that would be taken to ensure that banks are
adequately capitalized. The authorities need to improve the sectoral classification of loans to better
capture risky exposures, notably to real estate, in order to allow more accurate sensitivity analysis of
bank risks and solvency.
26.
Follow-up measures are needed to manage the risks to the banking system, such as
ensuring (through more frequent on-site visits) compliance with prudential regulations, and
enhancing surveillance (off-site) of bank and finance company risk management practices. A more
comprehensive set of high frequency liquidity risk management indicators and contingency funding
plans should be submitted by banks to the central bank’s supervisory units. In addition, there is a
need to conduct regular and comprehensive stress-testing to the system. Staff also encourages the
authorities to prepare the regular issuance of short-term government paper, which would help banks
to hold adequate buffers of highly liquid assets, even when the overall liquidity situation lead to a
decreasing supply of central bank CDs.
27.
Inflation has become less of a priority but remains a concern. While the absence of
monthly price data complicates assessment of inflationary trends and the formulation of appropriate
policies, anecdotal evidence and global developments indicate that inflationary pressures are
receding. Measures such as caps on food price and rent increases involve costly distortions and are
unlikely to provide more than temporary support in stemming inflation. Policies to address capacity
constraints and improve the economy's absorptive capacity, especially in the housing, construction,
and transportation sectors, are likely to be more effective in curbing inflation, even if implementation
takes time.
28.
As the main tool of macroeconomic stabilization in the context of the exchange rate peg,
fiscal policy needs to balance the objectives of containing inflation with the need to help
stabilize growth and employment. With inflation still high, staff sees a continued need to contain
and rationalize current expenditures, notably wages and implicit energy subsidies, and focus
investment on infrastructure. Support for public and semi-public corporates should aim to cushion the
fallout from the drying up of foreign financing and encourage adjustment to a less-buoyant outlook.
Staff welcomes the authorities’ intention to refrain from direct interventions to support the housing
and stock market; such interventions are distortionary, carry a potentially high fiscal cost, and risk
encouraging moral hazard.
29.
Should the economic environment deteriorate much more than expected, a more
counter-cyclical fiscal stance may be needed to support growth and employment. Public
investment may have to play a critical role in supporting activity should foreign and private demand
weaken more sharply than expected. This would strengthen the case for the coordination of fiscal
policies across emirates and the federal level to ensure that the overall fiscal stance will remain
supportive of macro-economic stability. Improving the monitoring and planning of the large

21

investment projects that are carried out by the government and by quasi-public entities outside the
budget—along the welcome steps recently taken by Dubai—will also be needed to ensure that overall
public investment is consistent with the economy’s absorptive capacity and to better manage
currency, interest and maturity risks associated with project financing.
30.
Staff welcomes the authorities’ intention to move ahead with preparations for the
introduction of the VAT, in coordination with other GCC countries. While a 5 percent VAT would
cause a modest one-off increase in the price level, it would not have a lasting effect on inflation, but
would make the budget less vulnerable to oil price fluctuations.
31.
Establishing reliable and regular statistics of public sector activities is key to assess the
fiscal stance and to monitor contingent liabilities. The Dubai government’s establishment of a
Supreme Fiscal Council in 2007 to coordinate government entities’ borrowing is an important step
and should be complemented by other initiatives to improve the oversight over public entities’
finances. Greater transparency on public assets and liabilities, notably preparation and publication of
the U.A.E.’s IIP, including the assets held by various SWFs, could help shore up investor confidence
by clearly signaling that the U.A.E. has the means to help the economy ride out the global storm.
32.
The peg of the dirham to the U.S. dollar remains appropriate provided inflation starts
slowing soon, as expected. The recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar, the easing of energy and
commodity prices, and the moderation of speculative pressures have removed some of the factors
behind the recent run-up in inflation, although the continued decline in the U.S. policy rate is likely
to keep real policy interest rates negative for some time. The peg will provide the benefits of a strong
and proven anchor in the stormy weather ahead, outweighing the costs of importing a monetary
policy that is not necessarily in line with U.A.E. policy needs.
33.
The U.A.E. dirham remains likely undervalued, given the limited real appreciation that
has taken place since 2004, despite large terms of trade gains. High inflation driven by nontradable prices also supports this assessment, although the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar, the
partial reversal of terms-of-trade gains, and continued relatively high non-tradables inflation—if
sustained—may soon eliminate any undervaluation. Estimates using standard approaches to quantify
misalignment are inconclusive, as for other oil exporters, but highlight that sizeable budget and
current account surpluses in the coming years are consistent with intertemporal equilibrium,
reflecting the need to replace oil wealth at least partly with financial wealth in order to ensure income
for future generations.
34.
Efforts to address substantial weaknesses in macroeconomic statistics need to accelerate.
The current international environment, with a reduced appetite for risk, puts a premium on addressing
data deficiencies as a matter of priority. The absence of monthly inflation data makes it difficult to
formulate meaningful anti-inflationary policies and hampers severely the estimation of reliable real
GDP aggregates. Staff encourages the authorities to move ahead with plans to establish a National
Bureau of Statistics by mid-2009, to collect and disseminate CPI data on a monthly basis starting in

22

2009, and to prepare an action plan aimed at developing the legal and technical capacity to collect
and publish IIP estimates.
35.
Staff welcomes the U.A.E.’s active participation in the International Working Group of
Sovereign Wealth Funds (IWG) and the U.A.E.’s endorsement of the voluntary principles
elaborated by the IWG, that would help support an open and stable international investment climate.
It urges the authorities to fully deliver debt relief assistance under the enhanced HIPC initiative.
36.

It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard 12-month cycle.

APPENDIX II: UNITED ARAB EMIRATES—RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
As of November 19, 2008
The World Bank
•

Investment Climate. In response to a request from the advisor to the Crown Prince
of Ras Al Khaimah (RAK) for assistance in the area of Foreign Investment and
Economic Development, a World Bank mission visited the emirate in late February
2004. Following discussion in RAK, the Bank team prepared TORs for the first of a
four-phase program, and an agreement was signed in late March. The second phase,
consisting in an assessment of the investment climate in RAK, was followed by an
Investors’ Promotion Conference in May 27–28, 2005 to increase awareness that this
emirate could quickly develop as a serious contender for investment destination.

•

The World Bank jointly with the IMF, conducted an update of the FSAP in
January 2007.

•

An implementation program program is currently under development. It is expected
to include drafting of a federal public debt law, designing a debt management unit
setup, and conducting a debt market infrastructure assessment.

International Finance Corporation (IFC)
IFC continues to provide ad hoc support to the U.A.E. at the federal and local levels through
its regional office in Dubai.

APPENDIX III: UNITED ARAB EMIRATES—STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance.
Shortcomings in the economic and financial data reflect inadequate compilation techniques,
infrequent data reporting, shortage of trained staff, insufficient resources assigned to data
gathering, and poor information flow between federal and emirate governments and public
sector entities. As a result, provision of data to the Fund between missions remains poor,
except for monetary and fragmentary trade statistics. The frequency of official statistics is
inadequate—most data are produced only on an annual basis. Despite recent institutional
improvements further efforts are needed to build a strong, comprehensive, and consistent
statistical system.
2.
On July 1, 2007, the Cabinet approved the creation of the National Bureau of
Statistics (NBS), which will undertake the current statistical functions and responsibilities of
the Ministry of Economy (MOE). The 1974 Statistical Law was revised and the draft of a
new federal statistics law, which explicitly refers to the NBS, was approved in October 2008.
3.
An April 2008 multisector/GDDS mission addressed institutional issues regarding the
development of the federal statistical system, provided technical assistance on
macroeconomic statistics, and promoted the adoption of the GDDS. On July 31, 2008, the
country began participation in the GDDS.
Real sector statistics
4.
The analytical framework underlying the national accounts broadly conforms to the
1968 SNA. GDP is estimated by the production approach for both constant and current prices.
Only current price expenditure estimates of GDP are available. GDP is compiled annually
with a lag of around 18 months. Most of the estimates are based on indicator series that are
applied to historical benchmarks. The year of the benchmarks is not known⎯year on year
growth in the indicator series are applied to the previous year’s value. Since the 2003
multisector mission, the MOE has updated the base year for the constant price estimates from
1995 to 2000. Currently, the authorities are working on compiling volume measures of GDP
at 2007 prices. Some progress has been made in improving the source data. Annual
establishment surveys are being implemented for Abu Dhabi and Dubai. The results of the
2007/08 Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) have yet to be incorporated into
the national accounts. A business register covering the whole country has been set up, but
further work is needed to establish appropriate updating procedures. No progress has been
made in the development of quarterly indicators.
5.
The current market basket CPI weights are derived from the 1996/97 HIES for Abu
Dhabi. The reference base for the index is year 2000. Prior to year 2000 the index was
compiled using market basket weights derived from HIES data from Kuwait and Qatar. In
general, the concepts and definitions used for compiling the CPI are consistent with

6
internationally recommended standards, using the Laspeyres index. The CPI employs a
national classification system with a level of detail consistent with the five digit level of the
Classification of Individual Consumption by Purpose for Household Budget Surveys. The
index is compiled for 620 market basket goods and services, 144 subgroups, 55 groups, and 8
major groups. The annual CPI for the previous calendar year is disseminated in March or
April of each year. For the period 2000 to the present, annual indices for eight major groups
and 55 groups are published for Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ras Khaima and the whole
country.
6.
In response to a request from the authorities, STA conducted a CPI mission in March
2007 and agreed on a two-year work plan to develop a monthly CPI in accordance with
international standards. From January 2007, the current CPI is compiled on a monthly basis,
but only the annual index is disseminated. Monthly indices for 2007 are recompiled using the
2007/08 HIES market basket weights. It is planned that these indices along with monthly
indices for 2008 will be disseminated when the new CPI is published in January 2009. This
would avoid having two sets of monthly indices published for 2007 and 2008.
7.
Although labor statistics collected in the census are broadly in line with ILO
recommendations, certain divergences remain. Lack of regular household surveys prevents
compilation of labor force statistics such as wages, unemployment, labor force and
employment. Wage statistics are available for a small proportion of government employees.
An employment/wages survey was launched recently, but data are not yet available for
dissemination.
Government Finance Statistics (GFS)
8.
The Ministry of Finance compiles data for the federal government only, which is
fairly small in comparison with the emirate governments. In addition, these data exclude a
large number of federal autonomous bodies and transactions undertaken by Abu Dhabi on
behalf of federal government. Separate fiscal data on the federal government and three
emirates (Abu Dhabi, Dubai, and Sharjah), which are provided to the Article IV consultation
mission, are used by Fund staff to provide a consolidated fiscal account for the U.A.E. The
MOE compiles annual general government fiscal data using aggregate information received
from the MOF and the seven emirates. An annual, “consolidated” fiscal statement is
published in the central bank’s Statistical Bulletin, which is different from the Fund staff
presentation. Most notably, investment income from government assets is not included in the
fiscal statement. In addition, key information, such as investment income, and expenditure
under the control of the respective Rulers’ Offices and municipalities, remains off-budget in
some emirates, hindering comparison of fiscal developments across the emirates and the
federal government. International standards of economic classification of expenditure and
revenue are not fully followed.
9.
To address some of these issues, the 2008 multisector mission recommended that the
compilation of consolidated general government GFS be made a high priority. The new
budget economic classification of the federal government is broadly consistent with the

7
GFSM 2001, although there are some exceptions, notably regarding the recording of
transactions in assets and liabilities. To this end, the 2008 mission recommended that the
federal government introduce a more comprehensive framework that would allow the
derivation of more analytic balances. It also recommended that the compilation and
dissemination of public and publicly guaranteed debt should be considered in the near future.
10.
The last data reported to STA for publication in the Government Finance Statistics
Yearbook refer to 1999 and cover only the federal government. No financing information is
provided by either the federal authorities or any of the emirates. No sub-annual data are
reported for publication to the IMF’s International Financial Statistics (IFS). Information on
pension fund activities administered by the authorities through the federal-level General
Pension and Social Security Authority (GPSSA) has been available since the 2002
consultation mission.1
Monetary and Financial Statistics
11.
The analytical framework underlying the compilation of monetary statistics is
generally sound and conforms broadly with the methodology in the Monetary and Financial
Statistics Manual (MFSM). Monetary data are compiled monthly but disseminated quarterly
in the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates (CBU) Quarterly Statistical Bulletin and
website, with a timeliness of about three or four months after the end of the reference month.
No information on nonbank finance companies are provided to the Fund.
12.
The country participated in the 2006 workshop on the harmonization of monetary and
financial statistics in the Gulf Cooperation Council region. As a result, test data based on the
Standardized Report Forms (SRFs) for the central bank (Form 1SR) and other depository
corporations (Form 2SR) were compiled for December 2005. The 2008 multisector mission
recommended that the CBU adopt the MFSM/SRF methodological framework for regularly
compiling and reporting monetary data to the IMF. The mission also recommended further
improvements concerning the statistical treatment of IMF accounts, sectorization of the
domestic economy, valuation procedures, and timeliness of the monetary statistics.
External sector statistics
13.
Staffing for compilation of balance of payments statistics is insufficient and
cooperation between the U.A.E. Central Bank and other government agencies remains
inadequate. The coverage of transactions of the nonfinancial private sector (other than
merchandise trade) is particularly sparse, and full reporting of public sector transactions is
not ensured. Although the economic environment has changed significantly, many estimates
are still based on outdated assumptions.
1

The GPSSA was established in January 1999 to provide pension and social security insurance benefits to all
nationals working in the government and the private sectors (except Abu Dhabi government employees which
have their own separate pension fund).

8
14.
The country does not report balance of payments (BOP) data for publication in IFS or
BOPSY. Trade statistics have been reported irregularly.
15.
The 2008 multisector mission found that a lack of reliable source data seriously
impedes the accuracy of the balance of payments statistics compiled by the CBU. A foreign
direct investment (FDI) survey conducted by the MOE is the main improvement in terms of
source data. The 2008 mission concluded that it was both necessary and feasible that the
CBU start disseminating monthly data on international reserves on their website. It should be
noted that the authorities report monthly data on international liquidity for publication in IFS;
international reserves are included in these data. Furthermore, the authorities should begin
developing and publishing estimates of the international investment position and external
debt statistics based on the FDI survey, a proposed new external debt survey among large
companies, and other information available. At the authorities request, in early 2009 STA
will field a BOP TA mission.
Socio-demographic statistics
16.
The MOE leads in conducting the population census and large surveys, while line
ministries collect data through their administrative reporting systems. A population and
housing census is conducted every 10 years. A population census was completed in 2005. At
present, no data exist on measures of income distribution, poverty and access to basic
services. A Household Budget Survey was initiated in April 2007.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with the
United Arab Emirates
On January 9, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with the United Arab Emirates. 1
Background
The United Arab Emirates (U.A.E.) macroeconomic performance during 2007–08 was strong,
with growth especially in the construction and services sectors and despite some slowdown in
the last quarter of 2008, due to the global crisis. Annual average inflation accelerated, driven by
domestic demand pressures (especially rents) and higher import prices (such as prices of food,
building materials and skilled and unskilled workers). Higher oil prices contributed to large
external current account and fiscal surpluses in both 2007 and 2008.
However, the outlook for 2009 and beyond has become more clouded, as the U.A.E. has been
adversely affected by the turmoil in global financial markets. This is evident in a widening of
sovereign risk spreads and a sharp downturn in stock markets—most pronounced for real
estate companies. Large private capital inflows, driven by expectations of an appreciation of the
dirham vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar, largely reversed over the summer of 2008; currency futures
indicate that markets no longer doubt the peg. Foreign financing for many corporates has
tightened, and a slowdown in real estate and construction seems underway. The global
weakening will reduce demand for tourism, trade, and financial services, while lower oil prices
may affect public spending. Growth in the non-oil economy is expected to slow down
considerably, while inflationary pressures should recede.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2

The U.A.E. banking system appears adequately capitalized and highly profitable, but risks have
risen. Banks’ assets and profits increased sharply in 2007 and the capital adequacy ratio stood
at 13.3 percent by mid-2008, above the regulatory minimum of 10 percent, though somewhat
below the level of 2007. However, the fast pace of growth of consumer and real estate loans
along with the uncertain outlook for asset prices has raised the risk of a future increase in
nonperforming loans (NPLs). Capital outflows, and growing concerns about counterparty risk,
have in recent months affected the functioning of the interbank market.
Money and private sector credit growth accelerated further in the first nine months of 2008, and
liquidity became tight in late summer. Credit to the private sector rose by 51 percent (year-onyear) in September 2008, up from 40 percent in December 2007, with demand driven by the
economic boom and highly negative real interest rates. In mid-2008, the central bank took
several steps to address a drying-up of liquidity following the outflow of foreign deposits.
Subsequently, to preempt spillovers from the global turmoil, the government issued a blanket
guarantee for deposits and inter-bank lending for three years, and put in place a $19 billion
emergency liquidity support fund to provide banks with long-term funding.
The short and medium-term outlook is subject to a number of downside risks arising from the
difficult global environment as well as domestic financial vulnerabilities in the wake of the recent
real estate and credit boom (especially in Dubai). The main risks to the outlook stem from (i) a
more severe global weakening; (ii) further tightening of foreign financing for investment projects;
(iii) an increase in the demand for domestic financing adding to banks’ stress; (iv) a correction in
the real estate market leading to a deterioration of asset quality in financial institutions; (v) a
drop in oil prices that constrains the scope for fiscal policy to support growth; and (vi) an
unexpected re-emergence of inflationary pressures.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities of the U.A.E. for their outward-oriented
development strategy and the impressive performance of the economy in recent years. The
U.A.E.’s open economy and established linkages with international financial markets have
played a key role in economic diversification and strong growth, but also make the U.A.E.
vulnerable to the current global financial turbulence. They referred in this context in particular to
the potential impact on external balances and growth through lower oil prices, more constrained
access to international financial markets, and weaker prospects for tourism, trade, and real
estate. Against that background, and taking into account the likelihood of an easing of
inflationary pressures in coming months, Directors agreed that managing the impact of the
global downturn and safeguarding financial stability have become the authorities’ key policy
challenges. Noting that it may be useful to coordinate the U.A.E.’s response to the economic
crisis with that of other Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) members, Directors welcomed the
progress made toward coordinating monetary policies indicated by the recent establishment of
the GCC Monetary Council.
Directors emphasized the importance of safeguarding the soundness and functioning of the
financial sector, while facilitating a smooth and orderly deceleration in credit growth from an

3
unsustainable pace. They welcomed the actions taken to guarantee deposits and inter-bank
lending for three years, and to establish liquidity facilities. They cautioned, however, that
contingency plans for a worse-than-expected downturn should focus on safeguarding only
systemically important institutions. Going forward, the fiscal costs of assistance to the financial
sector will need to be minimized, and incentives provided to prevent a buildup of risky assets.
Directors welcomed the plans to amend the banking law to strengthen the central bank’s
supervisory and regulatory power and to launch a thorough review of banks’ balance sheets,
off-balance sheet items, and large exposures. They urged the authorities to improve the
classification of loans in order better to assess risks, and to strengthen surveillance over bank
and finance company risk management practices.
Directors concurred with the authorities on the need to maintain essential ongoing infrastructure
investments to boost productive potential, while reining-in commitments for new projects and
rationalizing subsidies. They emphasized that any financial support for corporates should aim to
cushion the fallout from the drying up of foreign financing and promote adjustment to a
less-buoyant outlook. Directors agreed that if the economic environment deteriorates more than
expected, a more active countercyclical fiscal stance would be called for to support growth and
employment. Directors welcomed the establishment of the Federal Council to Coordinate Fiscal
Policy, aimed at coordinating budgets and expenditures between the emirates and at the federal
level and ensuring that the U.A.E.’s overall fiscal stance safeguards macroeconomic stability.
They supported plans to introduce a VAT over the next 2–3 years, which would make the
budget less vulnerable to oil price fluctuations.
Directors agreed that the exchange rate peg of the dirham to the U.S. dollar remains
appropriate, providing a strong and proven anchor in the stormy economic conditions that may
lie ahead. They took note of the staff assessment that the real appreciation of the dirham
in 2008 and the ongoing reversal of terms-of-trade gains with the recent drop in oil prices may
have eliminated any dirham undervaluation.
Directors welcomed the U.A.E.’s participation in the General Data Dissemination System. They
looked forward to the establishment of a National Bureau of Statistics, as planned, and the
dissemination of monthly CPI data in 2009. They encouraged the authorities to continue to
strengthen national accounts and public sector statistics. Directors emphasized that greater
transparency on public financial assets and liabilities could help shore up investor confidence.
Directors welcomed the U.A.E.’s active participation in the International Working Group on
Sovereign Wealth Funds (IWG) and its endorsement of the IWG’s voluntary principles to
promote an open and conducive climate for international investment.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on the United Arab Emirates
January 9, 2009

1.
This statement provides information on recent developments in the United Arab
Emirates that has become available since the staff report was circulated to the
Executive Board on December 3, 2008. This information does not change the thrust of the
staff appraisal.
2.
The oil price baseline assumption for the World Economic Outlook (WEO) was
revised downward (most recently in January 2009) and the U.A.E. announced that it will cut
oil production starting in January 2009 in line with OPEC’s decision. These developments
affect staff projections of oil exports, fiscal revenues and growth. The new assumptions
imply substantially lower U.A.E oil export prices of $49 per barrel for 2009 and $59 per
barrel for 2010 and an estimated decline in oil production by 5 percent in 2009. Assuming
unchanged expenditure policies, the fiscal surplus in 2009 would reach only 0.4 percent of
GDP compared to 12.1 percent in the staff report, and the current account would register a
small deficit of 3.7 percent of GDP in 2009 compared to a surplus of 8.7 percent in the staff
report. Real GDP growth would reach only 2.1 percent compare to 3.3 percent, on account of
lower oil production. From 2010 onward, both the fiscal and the current account balances
would record modest rising surpluses.
3.
As envisaged in the staff report, under this scenario maintaining the increased public
expenditure levels through 2009 remains appropriate and feasible, and additional fiscal
stimulus would be needed should the non-oil growth and employment situation deteriorate
more than expected. The likelihood of the latter has risen in view of the expected downward
revision of WEO projections for partner country and global trade growth. Furthermore, the
revised oil prices imply a substantial reversal of recent terms of trade gains and hence a
depreciation of the equilibrium real exchange rate. While the absence of recent price data
does not allow a quantitative update, it is likely that the dirham’s moderate undervaluation
assessed in the staff report is by now eliminated, even earlier than foreshadowed in the staff
appraisal. Indeed the dirham may by now be moderately overvalued.
4.
The Dubai government in late 2008 formed a high-level committee to manage the
fallout from the global crisis on Dubai’s real estate market. In January 2009 a federal decree
established a Federal Council to Coordinate Fiscal Policy with responsibilities to coordinate
budget and expenditure across emirates and at the federal level to ensure that the overall
fiscal stance remains supportive of macro-economic stability. The federal government is
merging two Dubai-based mortgage companies that have been facing difficulties raising
financing in the wake of the liquidity crunch (Amlak Finance and Tamweel, which together
account for and estimated 2/3 of Dubai’s housing lending market) with an amalgamation of
the Abu Dhabi’s Real Estate Bank and Emirates Industrial Bank. The government would
hold a majority stake in the new entity (Emirates Development Bank) which will have access

2
to the government emergency liquidity support facilities. This might help revive access to
financing for buyers in the real estate market and mitigate the risk of other institutions
exposed to Amlak and Tamweel through lending or ownership. Several public real estate
developers in Dubai have announced substantial lay-offs, as well as a slow-down in the
launching of new and implementation of ongoing projects. Several banks have further
tightened mortgage lending, while major developers have eased restrictions on resale of
unfinished properties (that had been earlier introduced to discourage speculation).
5.
As of December 31, 2008 stock markets remained sharply down for the year, more so
in Dubai (-73 percent) than in Abu Dhabi (-48 percent). However, both markets have shown
some recovery in early 2009. The U.A.E. central bank decided not to match the U.S. interest
rate cuts in late October and December, the first time of not following the Fed moves.
Interbank rates in the U.A.E. did not follow recent LIBOR declines and remained stable and
around 4 percent, pointing to continued liquidity tightness. Credit default spreads came
somewhat down from recent peaks, but remain elevated at around 650 bp for Dubai and 250
bp for Abu Dhabi. One-year dirham/U.S. dollar currency forwards now discount the dirham
by around 1 percent. Anecdotal evidence continues to point to declining property prices and a
rise in distressed sales in at least some segments of the U.A.E. market since October 2008.
6.
Heads of State of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) in late December approved
the draft of a monetary council in 2009, forerunner of a common central bank. The
agreement is to be ratified by all member states before end-2009. The deadline of 2010 for
establishing a common currency was not changed, but the monetary council may adapt the
schedule in view of the needed preparatory work.
