STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
The 2014 Article IV consultation takes place when the authorities have started to
address longstanding economic challenges. For a number of years Egypt has suffered
from low and non-inclusive growth and from high unemployment. Since 2011 these
problems have been compounded by large fiscal deficits and rising public debt and by
external fragility evidenced by loss of foreign exchange reserves. In 2014, Egypt adopted a
new constitution and elected a new president who was candid with the electorate on the
need to reform the economy. The government has developed a plan centered on structural
reform and investment promotion to raise growth and create jobs, and fiscal adjustment to
bring the budget deficit and public debt under control. Crucially, the authorities have already
begun to implement fuel subsidy reform, raising prices by 40–80 percent in July 2014. They
have also begun the reforms needed to raise tax revenue and to make Egypt a more
attractive destination for investment.
There was agreement that the authorities’ objectives are ambitious but are broadly
within reach with steady policy implementation. The authorities aim to raise growth to
6 percent per annum, reduce annual inflation to 7 percent, bring down the fiscal deficit to
8 percent of GDP and debt to 80–85 percent of GDP, and increase foreign exchange reserves
to 3½ months of imports, all within the next five years. Staff considers these objectives
appropriately ambitious, although targeting a higher level of reserves would be prudent. It
believes that the authorities’ policies, if followed steadfastly, are broadly consistent with
these objectives, but noted that a number of policies—including the details of some fiscal
measures and structural measures to improve the business environment—are still being
formulated.
The authorities and the staff differed somewhat on the extent of vulnerabilities and
risks. The authorities are confident that they will be able to follow through on their policies
and that improved confidence will lead to a surge in foreign investment, a pickup in tourism,
and strong economic growth. Staff emphasized that the authorities’ policies would still leave
significant vulnerabilities, namely high public debt and large financing gaps, which would
need to be covered by greater adjustment or financing, or a combination of the two. Staff
also pointed to the difficulty of maintaining tight fiscal and monetary policies over a long
period, the risks of dilution of structural reform efforts, and the uncertain regional security
environment. To contain these vulnerabilities and risks, staff recommended developing
contingency measures in the budget, taking steps to build up reserves buffers, and greater
exchange rate flexibility to restore competitiveness. However, staff also agreed that with
steadfast commitment to reform, Egypt’s prospects could be stronger than assumed in staff’s
projections. In particular, the recovery in investment could exceed expectations.

ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT

CONTEXT
1.
Egypt has been going through a period of dramatic change. The momentous events of
January 2011 ushered in a period of great hope but also great challenges. The political transition
entered a new phase with the change of government in July 2013. This was followed by the
approval of a new constitution in January 2014 and the election of a new president in May. The
political process is still continuing: parliamentary elections are scheduled for March-April 2015.
Underlying political and social tensions also remain. As recently as last month demonstrators and
security officers were killed during protests. Many protesters have been jailed and terrorist attacks
against security personnel and civilians are still taking place.
2.
The past four years of political instability have taken a toll on confidence, economic
activity, investment, and tourism. Amidst political turmoil, chronic economic problems were left
unaddressed and new problems became acute. Fiscal revenue and foreign exchange earnings
collapsed while expenditure rose sharply, causing persistent inflation, large budget deficits, sizable
external imbalances, and reserve loss.
3.
The restoration of relative political stability has given the authorities an opportunity—
which they have seized—to address Egypt’s longstanding economic challenges. The economic
reform agenda is a long one. The authorities’ policies to achieve inclusive growth and job creation
focus on pursuing structural reforms, promoting investment, and protecting the poor. They are
seeking to restore macroeconomic stability through fiscal adjustment, supported by a tight
monetary policy to contain inflation. Measures implemented so far, along with some recovery in
confidence, are starting to produce a turnaround. But the authorities’ success in meeting their goals
will depend on their steady efforts, willingness to take additional actions as needed, and continued
external support.
4.
The authorities see this Article IV consultation as an important step on the road to
recovery. They hope that their policies will resonate with the international community and with
investors who they will invite to an economic conference in March 2015, and see the views of the
Fund as an important contribution to their planning.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
5.
Egypt is facing major economic challenges, some of them longstanding. Recent
difficulties—especially low growth and high unemployment—should be seen in the context of
structural weaknesses which largely predate 2011. These stem mainly from large
macroeconomic imbalances, microeconomic distortions, low human capital, poor infrastructure,
low access to finance, and poor external competitiveness (Box 1). Structural challenges are
exemplified by poor rankings in business climate and competitiveness indicators. Egypt ranked
112 out of 189 in the World Bank 2015 Doing Business survey, reflecting considerable red tape,
cumbersome regulations, and poor enforcement of contracts and minority investors. The country

4

ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT

ranked only 119 out of 144 in the World Economic Forum 2014–15 Global Competitiveness Index
due to a deteriorated macroeconomic environment and particularly poor scores on labor and goods
market efficiency, financial market development, and education.
Box 1. Growth Diagnostic and Constraints to Growth
Growth was buoyant during 2004–10 (5½ percent annually on average) but did not generate jobs
sufficiently to absorb the young and growing population and to ensure inclusiveness. Growth was
driven mainly by consumption while investment lagged behind and the external sector contributed
negatively. Growth remained constrained by the insufficient quality of employed labor and lackluster gains
in productivity, with total factor productivity growing by a mere 0.8 percent per year.
Staff analysis suggests that the most binding constraints to growth and job creation in Egypt are
macroeconomic risks, microeconomic distortions, low productivity, low access to finance, and poor external
competitiveness.

Macroeconomic risks are reflected in fiscal and
external vulnerabilities which affect confidence
and investment.

informal sector. Poor enforcement of contracts
and an unpredictable judicial system are major impediments to doing business. The public sector is
large, generating 39 percent of formal GDP in 2013/14. Despite privatization operations in the past
decade, public institutions still control the majority of assets in the banking and insurance sectors; are
important players in the telecom and transportation sectors; and are dominant in sectors such as oil and
gas, refining, and electricity. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the military exercises significant control
over some public enterprises and land, although it is difficult to estimate the share of military ownership.



Low human capital, as evidenced by poor health and education indicators, and poor infrastructure—
especially roads and electricity—weigh on productivity. Education is underfunded and does not prepare
young people for productive employment, while public health services are subpar, limiting health
outcomes and human capital formation. The rising infrastructure deficit has been reflected in poor
transportation infrastructure, traffic congestion, distribution bottlenecks, and electricity, fuel, and water
shortages.



Low access to finance is an important constraint to growth. Credit to the private sector has been on a
declining trend as a share of GDP over the past decade. Low credit reflects crowding out from public
sector borrowing, which pushes interest rates up and reduces incentives to lend to the private sector.
Structural deficiencies are also significant, as reflected in low bank penetration and bank deposits. Credit
to SMEs is very low.



The negative contribution of the external sector to growth reflects poor overall competitiveness.
Nonoil merchandise exports were only 4.8 percent of GDP in 2013/14. Limited external linkages, real
exchange rate appreciation, and the unfavorable business environment have been obstacles.

6.
The political turmoil of January 2011 triggered a sharp capital account reversal and
left growth depressed, while policy accommodation widened fiscal and external imbalances.
The protracted political and institutional uncertainty, a perception of rising insecurity, and sporadic
unrest dented confidence. Large capital outflows ensued, along with declining investment and
tourism (Figures 1–4):


Real GDP dropped by 0.8 percent in calendar year 2011 and growth only recovered to about
2 percent annually in the following years, weighed by continued disruption of domestic
production due to political turmoil, and widespread energy shortages and electricity blackouts.



The fiscal deficit and debt rollover needs soared, pushing up domestic borrowing costs. Delayed
reforms, lower revenue, and rising wage, subsidy, and interest payments led to double-digit
budget deficits reaching close to 14 percent of GDP in 2012/13.



Faced with capital outflows, weak foreign direct investment (FDI), and widening current account
deficits, the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) supplied large amounts of foreign currency to stabilize
the exchange rate. While this provided an anchor to maintain confidence, it depleted
international reserves from $35 billion (6.8 months of imports) at end-2010 to $14.5 billion
(2.5 months) in June 2013. Exchange rate pressures were particularly strong in December 2012
and the first half of 2013, when reserves were only supported by sizable official financing from
Gulf countries, rapid depreciation, and foreign exchange rationing, which compressed imports
and generated a parallel market.



Social outcomes, which were already lagging, deteriorated further post-2011. Unemployment
peaked at 13.4 percent in 2013/14, with the highest levels found among youth and women.
Poverty rose to 26.3 percent in 2012/13, with another 20 percent of the population estimated
to be close to the poverty line.

Thus, by June 2013, Egypt’s economy was in a precarious position with low growth, high
unemployment, wide fiscal and external imbalances, and low reserves buffers.

Growth remained slow in 2013/14, but
the economy has now begun to recover. In
2013/14, GDP grew by 2.2 percent. Tourism and
natural gas extraction were adversely affected by
security concerns and some $6 billion in arrears to
oil and gas investors. Unemployment remained
stubbornly high at 13.1 percent in Q3 of 2014.
However, growth rebounded to 6.8 percent y-o-y
in Q3. The pick-up was particularly strong in
manufacturing and tourism.
8.
Inflation remains close to 10 percent,
though core inflation is lower. Inflation was
10.1 percent on average in 2013/14. It then picked
up in Q3 2014 due to fuel and tobacco price hikes
implemented in July 2014 and increases in school
tuition fees, reaching 11.8 percent in October.
Interest rate action by the Central Bank of Egypt’s
(CBE) helped contain second-round effects, and
headline inflation receded to 10.1 percent in
December. Core inflation was 7.7 percent.

external grants. To support domestic demand, the
government raised infrastructure and social spending by 1.8 percent of GDP, increased the minimum
wage for government workers by 70 percent, and raised wages of teachers and doctors. The budget
sector deficit was contained only thanks to grants from Gulf countries of 3.8 percent of GDP.1
Budget sector debt rose to 95.5 percent of GDP, while general government debt rose to
90.5 percent of GDP (a lower level because of cross holdings of debt by social insurance funds).

The 2014/15 budget represents a policy shift as the authorities implemented bold
energy price and tax hikes at the outset of the fiscal year to reduce the deficit. The adopted
budget targets a deficit of 10 percent of GDP (including grants equivalent to 1 percent of GDP).
The main measures already implemented include energy subsidy reforms (through price hikes for
fuel products by 40–80 percent and electricity by 20 percent), introduction of taxes on dividends and
capital gains, a 5 percent additional tax on high incomes, increases in excises on tobacco and

The authorities’ accounting of the budget sector deficit in 2013/14 is lower (12.8 percent of GDP), as they count as
grants the transfer to the budget of special deposits held at the CBE (equivalent to 1 percent of GDP), which had
been received from abroad after the 1991 Gulf war. Staff records those amounts as central bank financing below the
line, following Government Finance Statistics Manual (GFSM) principles.

alcohol, and a revamped property tax. These measures are expected to yield savings of 2½ percent
of GDP. The introduction of a fully fledged value-added tax (VAT) conforming to international
standards to replace the sales tax, the sale of a telecom license, and the adoption of a new mining
law are planned later in the fiscal year, with an expected yield of about 1 percent of GDP.

were covered by some $20 billion in Gulf aid (grants, deposits, and oil shipments). Reserves were
$14.9 billion at end-December 2014 (2½ months of imports).
12.
The official exchange rate has remained broadly unchanged since June 2013, but this
has generated a parallel market and a backlog of demand for foreign exchange. The pound
depreciated by 13 percent in the six months following the introduction of the CBE’s tightly managed
foreign exchange auctions in December 2012. However, since June 2013, large support from Gulf
countries allowed the CBE to stabilize the official exchange rate, which depreciated by less than
2 percent against the U.S. dollar. This has led the real effective exchange rate to appreciate by
18 percent at end-November 2014, due to high inflation differentials with trading partners and the
appreciation of the dollar against other major currencies. Restrictions in the auctions and on the
interbank market prevented a market-clearing adjustment, with the parallel market premium
fluctuating between 2–7 percent. Backlogs of foreign exchange requests from commercial banks
were only partially cleared through occasional large auctions. In December 2014, the CBE increased
the weekly auctioned amounts by 25 percent.
13.
The CBE’s monetary policy sought to balance concerns over inflation and the need to
support growth and finance the fiscal deficit. Overall, the monetary stance has remained broadly
accommodative, as the central bank accommodated the government’s financing needs by allowing
continuous use of the government overdraft facility. As a result, the CBE’s net credit to the
government increased to 24.1 percent of GDP in November 2014 (against 18 percent in June 2013).
However, the CBE acted decisively in July 2014 to keep inflation in check when it raised its policy
rates by 100 bps to preempt second-round effects of regulated price hikes. Credit to the economy
has remained subdued, growing at 8.5 percent in 2013/14 and falling in real terms. High nominal
interest rates discouraged credit demand while compressed differentials between lending rates and
earnings on government securities created little incentive for banks to lend to the private sector.

Aggregate financial soundness indicators point to the system’s resilience despite the
prolonged economic difficulties. Banking sector reforms in the 2000s, including restructuring and
consolidation, some privatization operations, and a cleanup of non-performing loans (NPL) meant
that banks faced shocks from a relatively strong position. As a result, profitability remained high and
system-wide NPLs declined further from 10.5 percent in 2011 to 9.1 percent in June 2014, with
provisioning coverage reaching 98 percent. Forbearance measures benefitting the hard-hit tourism
sector did not have a significant impact given the small share of such loans. Stress tests regularly
performed by the CBE suggest that plausible losses could be absorbed by banks’ profits and capital
buffers, and exchange rate exposure is not significant. However, despite ample domestic currency
liquidity, limited availability of foreign exchange generates sizable backlogs for bank customers.

Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance, but quality, timeliness, and overall
transparency could be improved. Government finance, monetary, and external sector statistics are
adequate, and transparency and dissemination have improved recently. However, only aggregate
banking data are available, and data on general government are available only with a lag.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
16.
Starting from a difficult position, the authorities seek to achieve higher and more
inclusive growth and job creation, while reducing inflation and the budget deficit. By 2018/19,
they target 6 percent GDP growth and 7 percent inflation, a budget deficit reduced to 8–8½ percent
of GDP and a budget sector debt down to 80–85 percent of GDP.
17.
As the authorities further flesh out and implement their policy initiatives, prospects
for growth, employment and macroeconomic stability will improve (Figures 5–6, Table 9).
With consistent implementation of policy plans in the coming years, staff projects that actual and
potential growth could reach 5 percent by 2018/19, due to structural reforms to raise investment
and improve productivity. If this materializes, unemployment could fall to 10 percent. Fiscal and
inflation objectives could be met, as lower domestic financing of the budget would support a

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT

deceleration of inflation. In the short term, growth is expected to pick up, from a low base, to
3.8 percent this fiscal year. However, despite an expected rebound in tourism, FDI, and portfolio
investment, high domestic demand and limited competitiveness will keep the trade and current
account deficits elevated. External financing gaps are expected to remain throughout the projection
period, with part of the gaps associated with a limited buildup of reserves to 3½ months of imports.
The authorities have somewhat more upbeat forecasts (see paragraph 34).
18.
Lower global oil prices are expected to improve Egypt’s overall prospects, although
weaker GCC external positions could affect official transfers and remittances. Lower prices will
reduce the net cost of energy in the balance of payments, although the impact will be relatively
small given the close-to-balance energy position. Lower prices will reduce significantly the fiscal cost
of fuel subsidies. Staff projections reflect the January 2015 World Economic Outlook projections,
although prospects remain highly uncertain and policies should be set in a prudent way that factors
in the possibility of a faster rebound of oil prices than implicit in futures prices. In particular, subsidy
reform should continue at the planned pace given the large remaining gap between retail prices and
cost recovery.
19.
Downside risks stem from Egypt’s current high vulnerability to global, regional, and
domestic shocks and from possible policy slippages. With the economy still in the early stages of
recovery and its fragile external reserves position, Egypt remains particularly vulnerable to adverse
shocks. There is a high likelihood of slower growth in advanced and emerging economies, and this
or an abrupt surge in global financial market volatility could have a large impact on expected
external inflows, including official support, FDI, and tourism, particularly from Russia. A slowdown in
global trade would affect Suez Canal revenues, offsetting some of the projected higher revenue
derived from the planned increase in the canal’s capacity. There is a moderate likelihood that
regional conflicts could intensify, especially in countries bordering Egypt. This or a deterioration in
domestic security conditions or perceived departures from the rule of law, could affect confidence,
investment, and tourism. Finally, policy delays could derail fiscal consolidation, widen imbalances,
and set back progress. Hence for the reform effort to succeed, it will need to be steadfastly pursued.
Risks could be mitigated by strengthening macroeconomic policies, preparing contingency
measures, and building buffers. In case of adverse developments further fiscal adjustment, greater
exchange rate depreciation and additional external financing may be needed. The authorities
considered the risks to be somewhat overstated, pointing to the progress already made in
implementing measures. They were also confident that their policies would reduce vulnerabilities
and the impact of shocks.
20.
There are also opportunities and upside risks, in particular those stemming from
successful implementation of the authorities’ policies. Early reform success and completion of
the political roadmap could boost confidence and restore macroeconomic stability more rapidly
than anticipated, and lead to higher growth and job creation and higher capital inflows. In particular,
tourism and FDI could recover more quickly than projected, especially if the investor conference in
March 2015 is successful. Several sectors such as energy, manufacturing, mining, construction, and
telecom could rebound on the back of the government’s structural reforms and renewed

14

investment. Portfolio investment could return more strongly than anticipated along with renewed
confidence and macroeconomic stability, possibly bringing down financing gaps. Internal market
reforms could reduce supply bottlenecks and have a beneficial impact on inflation. In sum, strong
policy implementation and a positive domestic and international response could lead to better
outcomes.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
21.
Policy discussions focused on the authorities’ strategy to achieve high growth and job
creation through structural reforms and investment promotion, while strengthening social
protection. Some elements of the strategy are already in place. Others are still being formulated,
and key decisions on details remain to be taken. However, there was broad agreement that given
the significant economic challenges, the authorities’ objectives are appropriately ambitious, and that
if their policy plans are fully implemented, they are broadly achievable.
22.
Staff and the authorities agreed that restoring macroeconomic stability is a
prerequisite for growth. The authorities have started to address the large fiscal deficit with actions
on subsidies, wages, and taxes, and intend to do more over the next months and years to achieve a
sustainable fiscal position and reduce public debt. They have raised policy rates to anchor inflation
expectations, and indicated their intention to pursue a tight monetary policy as needed to achieve
their inflation targets despite the anticipated upward pressure on prices from continued energy
subsidy reforms. There was agreement that external sustainability can be achieved by improving
competitiveness through structural reforms, lower inflation, and exchange rate flexibility, although
staff put more emphasis on exchange rate flexibility than the authorities. In the meantime, foreign
capital inflows and external financing will be needed.

A. A Strategy for Inclusive Growth
23.
Staff and the authorities agreed that structural reforms and investment are needed to
unlock Egypt’s growth potential and generate jobs for the growing population. The authorities’
initiatives, which are consistent with staff’s analysis of growth constraints, appropriately prioritize
improving the business climate, including through an ambitious overhaul of the regulatory
framework. They also aim to develop the financial sector, increase access to finance for SMEs, and
encourage higher investment. The social safety net is being strengthened to address poverty and
social needs.

Pursuing Structural Reforms and Financial Development
24.
The authorities are working on reforms of the regulatory framework for businesses
and investment to foster private sector-led growth. They have amended the competition law and
are preparing major revisions to the investment, bankruptcy, and corporate laws and regulations, as
well as those pertaining to access to land, with a view to removing burdensome regulations, leveling
the playing field for all businesses, supporting SMEs, and addressing the perceived high corruption.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT

In most cases legislation has not been finalized, and it will be important that the authorities avoid
dilution of the proposed reforms in the process of enaction, and ensure that implementation is
consistent and evenhanded. However, the authorities are certainly focusing on the right issues. They
have also settled a number of disputes with local and foreign investors and are advancing toward
further settlements. Reforms being prepared regarding public sector pay and hiring practices will
help reduce labor market distortions.
25.
Initiatives are underway to develop the financial sector and enhance financial
inclusion. The financial sector remains underdeveloped, as bank lending is low while capital markets
are relatively small. The authorities are revising the regulatory and supervisory framework to support
mortgage finance (the central bank is subsidizing bank lending to low and middle-income
borrowers through a fund equivalent to 0.9 percent of GDP), modernize capital markets, and
upgrade the framework for insurance. Enhancing the secondary market for government securities
would help further develop the yield curve for banks to price risks. The new microfinance law is
expected to support access to finance and create the conditions for further credit growth. Ongoing
efforts to develop mobile payments could also help increase the banks’ customer base and develop
financial inclusion.

Promoting Investment
26.
Staff and the authorities agreed that increasing investment is a priority, and would
boost demand and raise potential growth. Investment in people and physical capital can be
financed from both domestic and foreign sources, through public and private sector initiatives. The
increases in public spending on health, education, and scientific research mandated by the new
constitution can improve human and physical capital, if the additional spending is accompanied by
reforms to improve service delivery. Investment in infrastructure is needed, although caution is
warranted given the already high public debt. The March 2015 conference will be an opportunity to
raise private investment through FDI and PPPs. The authorities stressed that the latter will be
structured to minimize direct and contingent liabilities for the budget.
27.
The megaprojects, which are a cornerstone of the authorities’ growth strategy, offer
prospects for improvement but also carry risks (Appendix I). The flagship Suez Canal project
represents a major undertaking, and the successful domestic issuance of investment certificates for
its financing suggests strong confidence in the project and the country’s economic prospects.
Further development of the Suez Canal area and other megaprojects planned in housing, land
reclamation, energy, roads, and infrastructure have the potential to generate jobs and growth. At the
same time, these projects should be carefully designed and monitored to limit potential fiscal risks,
for example if they entail additional public investment, large contingent liabilities, or lower budget
revenues.2 Staff welcomed the fact that tax exemptions were not being considered. The projects’

stage of development for their fiscal implications to be clear.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT

impact on growth and employment should also be assessed, and priority should be given to
projects contributing to the country’s long-term growth and exports potential.
28.
Renewed investment in the energy sector is also a priority and presents opportunities
for long-term growth. The authorities understand that energy sector reforms and sizable
investments are critical to reduce energy supply bottlenecks, raise potential growth, and increase
exports. In this regard, the government’s efforts to settle some $6 billion in arrears to foreign
companies will help, and already implemented and planned increases in fuel and electricity prices
give some confidence that new arrears will not be incurred in the future. The government reports
growing interest in private investment in oil, gas, and electricity, although the willingness of
investors to commit resources may be reduced by recent falls in the oil price. There are also
encouraging long-term prospects for investment in renewable energy such as solar and wind.

Strengthening Social Protection and Fostering Employment
29.
Protecting the poor and the vulnerable is an essential element of the government’s
program. To complement the existing social solidarity pension system which covers 1.5 million
households, the authorities have launched two innovative cash transfer schemes: an unconditional
benefit for the elderly and disabled, and a conditional transfer for families to support children’s
health and education in poor areas. These are being piloted on 600,000 families in Upper Egypt and
are expected to cover 1.5 million households once fully rolled out. Moreover, bread subsidies were
streamlined and food ration cards reformed to allow greater flexibility in the choice of goods and
reduce leakages. Agricultural services, grain storage, and farmers’ access to finance will be improved
to reduce rural poverty. The planned increases in education and health spending, which will be
partly financed by savings from subsidy reforms, should also improve social outcomes.
30.
Prospects for higher employment should improve as the authorities’ policies are
implemented. Higher growth and structural reforms aimed at improving the business climate will
support employment. Increased education spending will also help in the medium term, especially if
it focuses on closing the jobs-skills mismatch and improving the employability of the working age
population. Reforms to public service pay should also help by limiting reservation wages, thereby
creating incentives towards private sector employment.

B. Reducing the Fiscal Deficit
31.
Staff welcomed the government’s plans to reduce the budget deficit over the next five
years. The government’s objectives are to reduce the budget deficit to 8–8½ percent of GDP and
budget sector debt to 80–85 percent of GDP, while at the same time increasing significantly
spending on health, education, and scientific research as mandated by the new constitution
(Appendix II). The strategy is to reduce large inefficient spending items—such as energy subsidies—
and widen the tax base, including by raising taxes on high earners, to create fiscal space for
increased social spending and investment, while reducing the deficit to make room for the private
sector. Key reform measures include:

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT



Subsidy reform. Following the July 2014 increase, the government intends to continue raising
fuel and electricity prices over the next 4–5 years. At the time, the plan would have required fuel
prices to rise by about 20 percent every year to reach close to cost recovery by 2018/19.
However, at current global oil prices, the phasing out of the subsidies could be achieved
sooner—which the staff would recommend—or with lower annual price increases. A new system
of smart cards has been launched to monitor wholesale and retail sales and combat smuggling
(Box 2).



Containing the wage bill. The government recently set a ceiling for public sector wages,
subjected bonuses to income taxes and discontinued the automatic inclusion of bonuses in
basic wages after five years. New hires have been centralized and require approval by the
finance ministry, and the use of public entities’ own resources for additional rewards to
employees has been discontinued. The authorities are also working on a thorough revision of
the public pay system and introducing an attrition scheme limiting the number of retirees to be
replaced.



Other spending. Through reprioritization, the authorities expect to reduce non-priority capital
spending by about 1 percent of GDP, while increasing health and education investment by
about the same amount, and to stabilize purchases of goods and services after the substantial
decline of the last few years. The non-priority spending to be cut has in most cases not yet been
identified.



VAT reform. The government plans to replace the current sales tax with a fully fledged VAT in
the spring of 2015 (Appendix III). A draft law following international standards has been
prepared and the tax administration is finalizing preparatory steps. Work is also underway to
develop a simplified tax regime for SMEs alongside the new VAT, and to improve tax compliance
and control systems.

32.
Staff and the authorities agreed that these plans could achieve the targeted deficit and
debt reduction, although it would be important to offset any delays and slippages. For
2014/15, staff estimates that the budget deficit will likely reach about 11 percent of GDP. However,
there are potential risks to this projection, as several pieces of legislation or actions such as the VAT
law, the mining taxation law, and the sale of an additional telecom license (yielding about 1 percent
of GDP) remain to be passed. Some elements of this, including the VAT rate, are still being finalized,
and it will be important that the decisions taken on these are consistent with the authorities’
revenue goals. There are also risks related to the performance of SOEs, as illustrated by a buildup of
EGPC tax arrears last year (1–1¾ percent of GDP). In 2015/16 and in the following years, it will be
key for the government to follow through on its plans to step up subsidy reform by raising energy
prices again, ensure that a well-functioning VAT is in place, identify spending cuts to offset the
planned increases in health and education spending, and more generally to keep expenditure in
check to reduce the budget deficit as targeted. With steadfast implementation of reforms, the
authorities’ deficit objective can be met by 2016/17 and their debt objective three years later
(although general government debt will fall below 80 percent of GDP already in 2018/19, see
Tables 5 and 9, and Appendix IV). At the same time, the authorities should be prepared to take
contingency measures in case of adverse shocks or if the expected savings are not fully achieved.

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT

Possible measures would include further steps to control public sector wage growth and hiring,
setting a higher VAT rate than currently envisaged, or raising it over time, and further strengthening
property taxation. The authorities’ plans to strengthen governance of SOEs would also mitigate fiscal
risks.
Box 2. Energy Subsidy Reform
Price subsidies for energy products have long been an important component of the social contract in Egypt.
The budgetary cost of these untargeted subsidies reached over 6 percent of GDP in 2013/14, reflecting their
universal provision as well as high international oil prices. In fact, this underestimates the true economic
costs as the Egyptian General Petroleum Company (EGPC) receives free crude oil and natural gas as part of
its production-sharing contracts. Moreover, when international prices exceeded budget assumptions, the
excess cost was borne by EGPC, affecting its financial performance and resulting in large arrears to foreign
partners and suppliers.
Over time, the price distortions associated with the subsidies have resulted in a worsening energy crisis,
causing large budget deficits and weighing on growth. The negative feedback loop between subsidies and
FDI in the energy sector stems from the diversion of an increasing share of energy production to satisfy the
domestic market. This has led to external arrears to foreign energy companies and a reduction of their
investment in new exploration.
Moreover, despite large subsidies
from the government, SOEs in the
energy sector have generally not
been able to meet the high energy
demand resulting from low prices.
For example, retail prices of LPG
cylinders have often been multiples
of their official price, defeating the
purpose of the subsidy. Electricity
outages have also become more
frequent.

Against this background, the
authorities intend to eliminate all subsidies over the next five years, with the exception of those for LPG
which are targeted to the poor. In July 2014, they substantially increased prices for both households and
commercial uses, with expected budget savings of close to 2 percent of GDP annually.1 The authorities’
strategy also includes rolling out smart cards to monitor consumption and limit smuggling. The recent fall in
oil prices will reduce the cost recovery price and will give some breathing space to the budget, although the
amount of subsidies to EGPC for this year has been set in the 2014/15 budget law, and there may be limited
room to change it.
The benefits of the untargeted energy price subsidies accrue mostly to high-income households in Egypt, as
they tend to consume a higher quantity of energy products. Based on staff estimates, the direct effect of the
July price increases for gasoline and diesel is mildly progressive, also reflecting low car ownership among
low and middle-income households.

Prices increased by 64 percent for diesel, 78 percent for Octane 80 gasoline, and 41 percent for Octane 92 gasoline.

The planned fiscal consolidation is ambitious, but necessary. The authorities are
planning a very substantial adjustment: among cases of adjustment in emerging and developing
countries, 65 percent saw a change in the cyclically adjusted primary balance of less than

needed increases in private sector credit.

C. Achieving a Secure External Position
34.
Views differed somewhat on balance of payments prospects. In staff’s view, the external
sector presents vulnerabilities. Staff projects that despite some external adjustment, financing gaps
will still reach about $36 billion (or about $7 billion per year on average) through 2018/19, of which
about half will be used to build up reserves to 3½ months of imports, which is the authorities’
medium-term target. On the positive side, the external debt would remain low in the medium term
(at about 17 percent of GDP). The rebound in tourism together with sustained remittance inflows
and additional Suez Canal revenue will support the current account, and rising FDI and portfolio
investment should provide much-needed external financing (Appendix V). However, the trade
balance deficit is expected to persist, as the growth of non-oil exports will be insufficient to cover
imports, the current account deficit will remain around 3½–4½ percent of GDP, and the magnitude
of future capital inflows remains highly uncertain. The authorities believe, however, that the current
account deficit will not exceed 3 percent of GDP on account of stronger prospects, notably for
tourism, and that higher FDI inflows will help reduce remaining financing gaps.
35.
Staff and the authorities agreed that at a higher reserves level would provide more
adequate buffers in case of shocks. Staff proposed targeting a level equivalent to 4½ months of
imports. This would bring reserves in line with the IMF’s reserve adequacy metric for flexible
exchange rate regimes and would protect against possible shocks to the current or capital

The expansion of the VAT to services will mostly affect high-income earners consuming services currently exempt.
Similarly, the simplified regime for small businesses will reduce the burden of thousands of taxpayers currently
registered under the GST, and some of the resulting savings are likely to be passed on to their (mostly low-income)
customers.

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT

account—such as a decline in global output that could affect exports and external financing, or
capital flight due to regional or domestic developments.4 It would also instill greater investor
confidence and, hence, help attract investment. The authorities indicated that if balance of payments
developments are more favorable, they will consider targeting a level of reserves higher than the
currently planned 3½ months of imports.
36.
There was agreement that more exchange rate flexibility would be desirable in the
future, though views differed on the priority to be attached to this and on the timing. The
staff sees the avoidance of excessive real appreciation as critical to ensure external sustainability,
and recommends that this be achieved through introducing greater exchange rate flexibility with
support from other macroeconomic policies. The CBE agrees that more flexibility in the future is
desirable, but only once conditions are appropriate: at present it emphasizes the importance of an
orderly foreign exchange market.


In staff’s view, the sizable real appreciation of the past year (estimated at about 18 percent
between June 2013 and November 2014) combined with large shocks to economic
fundamentals and the poor investment climate has affected competitiveness, leading to an
overvaluation of the Egyptian pound estimated between 3 and 28 percent. Although estimates
of exchange rate overvaluation are subject to significant uncertainty, they are consistent with the
persistently high non-oil trade deficit and a decline in Egypt’s share of world non-oil exports, as
well as with the fact that the current account deficit is larger than the norm (Appendix VI). The
current account norm, estimated at about -2.5 percent of GDP, is the level considered
sustainable given Egypt's macroeconomic fundamentals. The CBE believes that the recovery of
tourism and FDI inflows will durably improve the balance of payments position, removing any
perception of overvaluation.



Staff favors a flexible exchange rate policy that would allow the real exchange rate to move with
fundamentals. Flexibility can be achieved in the near term by removing restrictions in foreign
exchange auctions and in the market, which would eliminate the parallel market premium and
allow a market-clearing exchange rate with movements in both directions to avoid one-way
bets. The CBE, however, believes that a move before conditions are appropriate would lead to
speculation. It acknowledges the importance of improving the availability of foreign exchange
through formal channels, to close the existing backlog and reassure investors that demand for
foreign exchange will be met.

4

Reserves equivalent to 4½ months of imports translates to a reserve coverage of 77 percent of the standard reserve
adequacy metrics under a fixed exchange rate regime and 139 percent under a flexible exchange rate regime. The
latter falls within the 100–150 percent range that is considered adequate.

D. Stabilizing Inflation and Supporting Private Sector Credit Growth
37.
There was agreement that a strong, independent monetary policy is needed. Staff and
the authorities agreed that lower inflation would be critical to support competitiveness, protect the
poor, and foster growth. Hence, staff supported the CBE’s inflation objectives and welcomed its
willingness to tighten monetary policy as needed to achieve them. While monetary policy has been
constrained by large fiscal deficits, the upcoming consolidation will help bring inflation down by
containing domestic demand. That said, the planned VAT and fuel price increases will continue to
put upward pressure on prices and may necessitate further increases in policy interest rates to
contain second-round effects. In time, as inflation comes down and expectations become better
anchored, there should be room to reduce interest rates.
38.
A strong banking sector will be critical to support private sector growth. The banking
system has been resilient in the face of economic turmoil in recent years. Profitability remains high,
NPLs are low, and domestic liquidity is ample. This result, however, was achieved along with low
credit to the private sector, as banks benefitted from investing in high-yielding, zero-risk weighted
government debt. High exposure to the sovereign puts a premium on maintaining public debt
sustainability. Risks are mitigated by the banks’ stable funding base through deposits, and most
lending is denominated in domestic currency. High credit concentration in banks’ loan portfolios
could represent a risk, although prudential regulations limit the size of exposures and banks are
seeking to diversify their lending.5 Lower fiscal deficits would make it possible for banks to increase
private sector lending, and business climate reforms may increase demand for credit.
39.
Staff welcomes the CBE’s intention to continue strengthening the regulatory and
supervisory framework. The CBE is completing Pillar 2 of Basel II and is on track to implement
Basel III according to the internationally agreed schedule. The macro-prudential supervision
framework has been strengthened, including through regular stress testing, which the CBE is refining
on a continuous basis. The CBE also plans to increase the timeliness and scope of disclosure of
banking sector data, and will consider publishing regular financial stability reports to enhance their
communication strategy and increase confidence in banking sector soundness.

5

Credit concentration limits follow international standards and appear to be well enforced, but exposure to large
companies dominates in the loan book, implying that many banks have nearly reached their limits, and in one
instance the limit was increased on an ad hoc basis to increase lending to an SOE.

E. Article VIII Issues
40.
Staff is assessing whether aspects of the foreign exchange system give rise to
exchange restrictions or multiple currency practices subject to Fund approval under
Article VIII, Section 2(a) and 3, in view of the reported backlogs in accessing foreign exchange for
the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions, the wide spread
between the official and parallel markets, and the insufficient supply of foreign exchange through
the auction mechanism. Staff is seeking relevant information and clarifications from the authorities
to finalize its assessment.

STAFF APPRAISAL
41.
Egypt has chosen a path of adjustment and reform which, if followed resolutely, will
lead to economic stability and growth. The choice is epitomized by reform of fuel subsidies,
which have been at the heart of Egypt’s structural and fiscal problems for years. The significant
increase in fuel prices and the commitment to multi-year subsidy reform was a transformative and
welcome step. Similarly, the first steps to reduce the budget deficit and improve the investment
climate suggest strong commitment to reform.
42.
The authorities’ first task is to implement policies which will restore growth, create
jobs and protect the poor. The three strands of the authorities’ strategy can be woven together to
produce a durable improvement in living standards.


The first strand includes priority measures to unlock private sector-led growth, notably a
thorough reform of the regulatory framework for businesses and investment. It will be important
that as legislation is formulated and implemented the authorities preserve aspects of the
reforms which encourage open competition and support growth, and avoid capture by special
interests. Financial sector development will also be increasingly important as the budget deficit
recedes.



The second strand is investment to repair Egypt’s fraying infrastructure. Energy sector reforms
and sizable investments are critical to reduce energy supply bottlenecks. There are also
ambitious plans for investment in other areas, from industrial development, to land reclamation
to housing. Here priorities will need to be set and the private sector closely involved, given
limited resources and already high public debt. The focus should be on investment which will
create jobs in the short term and increase potential growth and exports in the long term.
Projects should also be carefully designed and monitored to avoid large actual or contingent
budget liabilities.



The third strand is protection of the poor. The launch of a cash transfer scheme and the reform
of food ration cards are welcome, as is the government’s commitment to take further steps to
improve targeting and increase benefits. More public spending on education and health, if
managed wisely, can improve the quality and availability of public services, support long-term
growth, and help the poor and other vulnerable groups.

43.
Fiscal consolidation is essential for stability and medium-term sustainability. Successive
governments have grappled with how to restrain the budget deficit in an environment of low
growth and political uncertainty. Now, the combination of relative political stability, financing from
Gulf countries, and a recovering economy provide an opportunity for reform. The government has
made an excellent start, but it will be important to keep up the momentum. The immediate priority
is to enact a modern VAT with the rate and coverage consistent with the authorities’ fiscal targets.
The next will be to implement the second stage of subsidy reforms. Meanwhile broader tax reform
and wage and other spending control initiatives should continue. Fiscal adjustment is essential to
restore debt sustainability. It will also give space to the CBE to conduct the independent monetary
policy needed to anchor inflation firmly down to single digits.
44.
The authorities’ plans for fiscal adjustment are well calibrated to minimize the drag
on growth, improve medium-term prospects, and protect the poor. The fiscal program
envisages gradual consolidation and a rebalancing of public spending toward investment,
education, and health financed by an increase in tax revenues and cuts in inefficient, untargeted
energy subsidies and containment of the wage bill. This will increase human and physical capital,
productivity, and potential growth. However, improving the quality of public spending in social
sectors will be critical to ensure that additional funds are well spent and targeted. Ongoing and
planned reforms of wage-setting and hiring rules in the government sector will be important to
increase efficiency, reduce labor market distortions, and free resources for more productive uses.
The government should also be ready to increase social transfers further to protect the poor from
the impact of fiscal adjustment.
45.
The balance of payments remains vulnerable, and should be strengthened by policy
adjustment. The current account deficit excluding grants rose last year to five percent of GDP,
significantly above the norm. As a result of the rising deficit and of capital outflows, Egypt has lost
half its reserves of 2011. There is also continued evidence of foreign exchange shortages, in the form
of a parallel market and a backlog of foreign exchange demands from companies. Looking forward,
the authorities’ policies would still leave significant vulnerabilities, namely high public debt and large
financing gaps, which would need to be covered by greater adjustment or financing, or a
combination of the two. While there has been some movement of the nominal exchange rate over
the past two years, a more flexible exchange rate policy focused on achieving a market-clearing rate
and avoiding real appreciation would improve the availability of foreign exchange, strengthen
competitiveness, support exports and tourism, and attract foreign direct investment. This would
foster growth and jobs and reduce financing needs.

46.
Egypt is also vulnerable to a deterioration of the security situation and domestic policy
reversals. In addition to a supportive economic environment, investor confidence depends on
security and evenhanded application of the rule of law. The authorities have made significant
progress in re-establishing security: the level of disruption of economic life is much less than in the
recent past, although the country remains vulnerable to regional and indigenous terrorism. With
regard to the rule of law, some recent judicial decisions have disconcerted international observers
and could raise concerns among investors. There are also implementation risks given the magnitude
of the required adjustment. For the reform effort to succeed it will need to be pursued steadfastly:
with reform objectives being translated into coherent and consistently implemented laws. The
measures already taken by the authorities demonstrate their commitment to reform. However, all of
these risks suggest a need to build financial and policy buffers. Raising international reserves and
preparing contingency plans for the budget in case risks materialize would be useful to address
unforeseen shocks and boost confidence.
47.

It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard 12-month cycle.

4/ The authorities accounted as grants in 2013/14 and 2014/15 the transfer to the budget of special deposits held at the CBE received from abroad
following the 1991 Gulf War. Staff recorded these amounts as central bank financing below the line, consistent with GFSM principles.
5/ Oil revenue minus fuel subsidies. Oil revenue includes corporate income tax receipts from EGPC and foreign partners, royalties, extraordinary
payments, excise taxes on petrol products, and dividends collected from EGPC.

Appendix I. Megaprojects
1.
The authorities’ strategy to boost growth and employment relies on increasing
domestic investment. To this end, they are working to improve the business climate and attract
FDI, and are also designing large infrastructure projects.
2.
Although preliminary, the list of possible megaprojects includes: (1) the Suez Canal
Regional Development project, which comprises the digging of a parallel canal and the widening of
the current one by mid-2015 and, in a second stage, the development of services around the Canal’s
core activities; (2) the building of one million houses around greater Cairo; (3) the construction and
rehabilitation of 3,000 km of new roads; (4) the reclamation of one million acres of land;
(5) renewable energy projects; and (6) the “Golden Triangle” aiming at exploiting the natural
resources in the region between Qena, Quseir and Safaga while developing the area for touristic,
industrial, commercial, and agricultural activities.
3.
The Suez Canal project is the most advanced and is the only one incorporated in staff’s
projections. To finance its first stage, the Suez Canal Authority (SCA) issued in September 2014
LE64 billion (about $9 billion) non-tradable investment certificates with a maturity of five years and
an interest of 12 percent. Interest and principal will be paid by the SCA and will therefore reduce
budget revenues correspondingly through lower corporate income taxes and dividends by about
$13 billion over five years.
4.
The feasibility of the other projects is currently still being considered, and plans to
finance them are being prepared to minimize direct and contingent liabilities for the budget.
Government involvement will be constrained by current limitations in managing a large number of
public investment projects. Still, since most of these projects are large infrastructure ventures, there
are risks of generating contingent liabilities for the budget. Based on staff’s understanding of
current plans, the housing megaprojects would be mostly financed through the sale of the
properties and land, although incentives for homebuyers are planned. The construction of new
roads would involve mainly public funds within the planned envelope for public investment and in
some instances (i.e. toll roads) with involvement of private capital. The land reclamation project
could benefit from support from IFIs, although the needed infrastructure will have to be financed by
the budget. The renewable energy projects (mainly solar and wind) should involve mainly private
investors, although the government has recently adopted a “feed-in tariff” which guarantees the
price of the energy produced, and will also guarantee the bank loans of the private investors.

Appendix II. Increasing Spending on Education,
Health, and Scientific Research
1.
The new 2014 constitution mandates an increase in spending for basic education, higher
education, health and scientific research to reach, respectively, 4 percent, 2 percent, 3 percent, and
1 percent of GDP in the budget by 2016/2017. In 2012, spending on health and education in Egypt
was well below those levels, and also below those of Jordan and Tunisia, two countries in the region
for which the functional classification is available.

Spending on Health and Education, 2012

Egypt

Tunisia
Health
1.4%
3.0%
1.7%
Education
3.6%
3.8%
5.7%
Note: The functional classification does not single out spending on research, which is
allocated across all functions.

2.
The authorities are currently assessing whether their compilation of the functional
classification, which identifies health and education spending exclusively according to the respective
line ministries, is appropriate. Indeed, international accounting standards allow for a broader
definition that would include health and education expenditure carried out by other ministries, for
example when they operate hospitals or provide education. Using such broader definition, the
finance ministry’s preliminary estimates suggest that overall spending on education, health, and
research amounted to 5.3 percent, 2.4 percent, and 0.1 percent of GDP, respectively, in 2013/14.
3.
On this basis, spending on these items should increase by 2.2 percent of GDP by 2016/17.
The 2014/15 budget already incorporates an initial increase in health and education spending of
0.5 percent of GDP. Hence, the remaining 1.7 percent of GDP would be allocated to the next two
budgets.
4.
The additional spending should aim at improving health, education and research outcomes
and not simply increase the size of the government. A rapid spending increase could lead to waste,
inefficiencies, and/or an increase in public wages (a legitimate concern, as wages represent about
63 percent of spending on health and 85 percent on education) instead of targeted initiatives and
investment. Even though the short timeframe will not allow for the development of a full-fledged
program-based framework to plan and monitor these programs, the authorities should announce
the goals they intend to achieve in terms of education, health, and research outcomes, allocate
funds accordingly, and monitor results.

Appendix III. Tax Revenues in Historical Perspective
1.
Total tax revenues in Egypt declined significantly over the past two decades from a peak of
19 percent of GDP in 1993/94 to 13 percent in 2013/14. This reflected mainly the loss of 3 percent of
GDP in custom duties (taxes on international trade) and a 1½ percent of GDP tax decline in other
(mainly trade-related) taxes. Taxes on goods and services remained virtually flat over the period at
about 5½–6 percent of GDP (except in 2013/14 when some SOEs failed to remit part of their tax
collections) following the introduction of
Egypt: Budget Sector Tax Revenues, 1989-2014 1/
the GST in 1991.
2.
Income taxes were the largest
source of tax revenue, but were volatile
as about half of the proceeds came from
corporate taxes on EGPC and the Suez
Canal (which depend on external factors
including world oil prices and volume of
international trade) and occasionally
from the central bank; less than
20 percent of income tax proceeds now
derive from personal income. The rise in
property taxes over the past five years
was due to the introduction of a
10 percent tax on interest earned on
T-bills and bonds (recorded as a tax on
property).

3.
The decline in custom duties—due to
tariff reductions, trade agreements, and rising
discretionary exemptions—was originally
expected to be compensated by increases in
domestic taxes on goods and services.
However, the GST’s standard rate was kept at
10 percent (significantly lower than the
average for non-OECD countries) and its base
has yet to be broadened to services (the yield
of 1 percentage point of GST in Egypt is only
about 0.2 percent of GDP, against typically
0.4 percent or more in emerging economies).

4.
Going forward, converting the GST into a modern VAT, with a unified rate extended to
services and with exemptions limited to essential food items, could reverse the declining trend in
revenues. The introduction of a tax on income from dividends and capital gains, which took effect in
July 2014, has also helped.

Appendix IV. Public Debt Sustainability Analysis
Public debt sustainability risks remain significant although mitigated by an ambitious fiscal
adjustment plan and a friendly domestic investor base. General government debt stands at about
90 percent of GDP and is projected to fall below 80 percent by 2018/19. Gross financing requirements
are large, at about 50 percent of GDP. Moreover, the average maturity of the debt is low at about
two years. While most debt profile indicators are above early warning benchmarks, the relatively low
external debt together with a captive domestic investor base shelters the domestic bond market from
changes in global market perceptions.
1.
The baseline scenario assumes a general government balance moving from 13.6 percent of
GDP in 2013/14 to 11.0 and 8.5 percent of GDP, respectively, in 2014/15 and 2015/16. The deficit
dynamics results from containing spending pressures while at the same time introducing measures
of 2.3 percent of GDP in the current fiscal year and up to almost 6 percent of GDP by the end of the
projection period. External debt is projected to remain broadly constant as a share to GDP. Growth is
projected to rebound to 3.8 percent in 2014/15, from 2.2 percent in 2013/14, as conditions
normalize and the economy recovers.
2.
The heat map suggests that both the debt level and the gross financing requirement are
above safe levels. This raises the risk of financing through the central bank to cover the financing
gaps. In contrast, the debt profile is rather favorable. Sovereign spreads and external debt in foreign
currency are relatively low. Short term debt is assumed to fall as a share to GDP, consistent with the
authorities’ plans to lengthen the average maturity. The analysis of debt-creating flows shows that
debt going forward is mainly driven by a favorable dynamics of the interest rate-growth differential,
which remains negative over the projection period.
3.
Risks around this central scenario are mainly tilted to the downside. Growth projections have
been optimistic in the recent past (Figure Realism of Baseline Assumptions), while at the same time
growth has been supported by an expansionary fiscal stance (Figure Realism of Baseline
Assumptions, continued). Recent projections of the primary deficit have also turned out to
underestimate the extents of fiscal pressures. Moreover, the planned maximum reduction in the
cyclically adjusted balance over three years of 5.6 percent is rather ambitious. The starting primary
deficit, however, is very large and on the high side of the distribution.
4.
Stress tests suggest that the main risk for the debt dynamics is related to growth and
interest rates. A one standard deviation fall in growth compared to baseline would drive debt up to
almost 95 percent of GDP. Given the short maturity of the debt, changes in domestic real interest
rates would have a significant pass-through to the budget in terms of interest expenditures and
imply a persistently high debt over the medium term. A combination of the main macro-fiscal
shocks would drive the debt to almost 100 percent of GDP within two years.

3/ Long-term bond spread over U.S. bonds.
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year.
5/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as ae(1+r).
8/ Includes asset changes and interest revenues (if any). For projections, includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Appendix V. External Debt Sustainability Analysis
1.
Egypt’s external debt is projected to rise but to remain at moderate levels in the
medium term. External debt amounted to $46.1 billion at end-2013/2014 (16.1 percent of GDP),
marginally higher than the previous year. About 92 percent of total is medium- to long-term debt
and 99 percent is owed to official creditors, mainly by the government. In 2012/13, external debt
rose sharply by about 26 percent, the largest increase in the past 10 years, due mainly to financial
assistance provided by Libya and Qatar. In 2013/14, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab
Emirates provided substantial financial support, mostly in the form of grants. In 2014/15, support is
expected mostly from the UAE in the form of loans, which will increase the external debt stock.
Going forward, external debt is projected to remain between 16–17½ percent of GDP over the
medium term, reflecting reliance on temporary financial assistance from countries in the region.
2.
External debt trajectories would downtrend in case of shocks based on historical
values. The shock levels under the stress tests are based on 10-year historical deviations,
representing plausible rather than extreme and permanent shocks. Currently, average historical real
GDP growth and the current account balance are higher compared to medium-term projections,
which would lead to a decline in external debt-to-GDP ratios if such historical values are applied. On
the other hand, an increase in external interest rates causes only a marginal deviation in the outlook.
3.
Among the stress tests, a large depreciation of the real exchange rate would have the
largest impact on external debt. A 30 percent real exchange rate depreciation in 2014 would lead
to a 10 percentage point increase in the external debt-to-GDP ratio in 2019 compared to the
baseline. This, however, is a static analysis and does not reflect the trade adjustments that would
likely take place. A shock to the current account would also lead to a considerable increase in the
external debt-to-GDP ratio, which would rise by 5 percentage points compared to the baseline.

Appendix VI. External Sector Assessment
Staff analysis suggests that the direction of exchange rate policy will be extremely important for the
sustainability of Egypt’s external sector. Serious risks could arise from the combination of inflation
above that of trading partners with limited movement of the nominal exchange rate during the
projection period. Macroeconomic and structural reforms that would restore investor confidence and
boost competitiveness, coupled with the introduction of greater exchange rate flexibility, would
improve sustainability and reduce risks. The exchange rate appears overvalued based on the standard
IMF methodologies. The current account has recently been supported by temporary GCC financing.
Global trade shares have declined and capital flows are low and volatile, although there are initial
signs that investor confidence is coming back. Qualitative indicators point to structural weaknesses.
The reserve level is below standard levels of adequacy based on the Fund’s reserve adequacy metric.
1.
Exchange rate assessment. As of October 2014, Egypt’s real effective exchange rate (REER)
has appreciated by 11 percent since end-2010 due to persistent inflation differentials with trading
partners and limited exchange rate
Effective Exchange Rate, 1990-2014
flexibility despite several nominal
(Index values: 2005 =100)
adjustments totaling 19 percent (Figure 1). 220
Similarly, over a longer time horizon, the
200
REER has appreciated considerably, mainly
180
due to the episode of high inflation due

160
REER
to rising food prices starting in 2008,
140
which reversed much of the
120
competitiveness gains from the nominal
100
depreciation in the early 2000s. As a
80
result, the current REER level is about
60
28 percent above its average of the past
15 years and 29 percent above its average
of the past 10 years (Table 1).

REER assessment yield an estimated overvaluation ranging from 3–28 percent (Table 1). These
estimates are subject to uncertainty, including due to structural changes in the economy. However,
the limited price competitiveness suggested by these estimates are consistent with the persistently
high non-energy trade deficit, largely financed by official transfers in the past few years, and the
decline in Egypt’s share of world non-oil exports. Survey-based measures further suggest that
Egypt’s non-price competitiveness is weaker than that of its peers, and that there is considerable
scope for macroeconomic policies and structural reforms to improve competitiveness (see below).

Egypt’s share in global trade has declined over the past five years. The share of nonoil
exports fell by more than 40 percent between 2008/09 and 2013/14 to 0.09 percent of global nonoil
exports. Factors that undermine competitiveness include exchange rate overvaluation, a
deterioration in macroeconomic fundamentals, political instability, and structural weaknesses. On
the positive side, Egypt has succeeded in diversifying its economy in the last 20 years, and is
relatively more diversified compared to other countries in the region as well as to emerging and
developing economies as a group. However, oil and gas exports still represent close to 50 percent of
total exports in 2013/14.1

Oil imports are broadly of the same magnitude as exports. The oil trade balance is about -0.6 percent of GDP.

Qualitative indicators highlight important structural challenges to competitiveness.
Egypt ranks 112 out of 189 in the World Bank 2014 Doing Business survey, suggesting considerable
red tape, cumbersome regulations, and poor enforcement of contracts and minority investors. It
ranks only 119 out of 144 in the World Economic Forum 2014–15 Global Competitiveness Index due
to a deteriorated macroeconomic environment and particularly poor scores on labor and goods
market efficiency, financial market development, and education. A rising infrastructure deficit is
visible in poor transportation infrastructure, traffic congestion, distribution bottlenecks, and
electricity, fuel, and water shortages.
5.
The current account deficit has declined in recent years, largely due to GCC financing.
The latter has mostly been in the form of official transfers, government deposits, and in-kind oil
grants. Some GCC countries have pledged to

return of political stability and measures to address long-standing subsidy and energy-related issues
have improved investor confidence. In particular, FDI registered strong growth in Q1 2014/15, and
investors’ interest has started to return, particularly in the oil sector.
7.
Despite large GCC financing, foreign exchange reserves remain below standard metrics
of adequacy.2 As of end-December 2014, reserves stood at 2½ months of imports or 40 percent of
the standard reserve adequacy metric for fixed exchange rate regimes. This represents a large drop
from the average coverage of 117 percent of the reserve adequacy metric for the past 10 years.

Exchange Rate Arrangement
1.
Between January 29, 2003 and February 2, 2009, the Egyptian pound was allowed to float,
and the exchange arrangement was classified as “managed float with no pre-announced path for
the exchange rate.” In December 2004, the CBE launched the foreign exchange interbank market
with no controls on rates, governed by a formal interbank convention on foreign exchange trading.
Effective February 1, 2005 Egypt’s exchange rate was reclassified to a conventional pegged
arrangement, and subsequently adjusted to managed floating with no predetermined path for the
exchange rate (effective August 1, 2007,) other managed arrangement (effective April 30, 2008),
crawl-like arrangement against a composite basket (effective March 12, 2009), stabilized
arrangement (effective April 1, 2011), crawl-like arrangement (effective November 10, 2011), and
stabilized arrangement (effective July 3, 2013).
2.
Egypt maintains a bilateral payment arrangement with Sudan which has been inoperative
since the late 1990s.
3.
Effective December 30, 2012, the CBE introduced a multiple price auction mechanism to buy
and sell foreign exchange. In addition to its regular weekly auctions, the CBE held occasional
exceptional auctions to cover outstanding import needs for priority imports. Restrictions imposed by
the CBE on the auctions and on the interbank market led to an insufficient supply of foreign
exchange at the daily exchange rate determined by the central bank and contributed to the
development of a parallel foreign exchange market.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of end-December 2014)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance, but quality, timeliness, and overall
transparency could be improved. Government finance, monetary, and external sector statistics are
adequate and recent efforts have improved transparency and dissemination. However, only
aggregate banking data are available, and quarterly data on general government are available
only with a lag. Finances of state-owned enterprises and their relations to the budget, particularly
in the energy sector, remain non-transparent.
National accounts: The National Accounts Department within the Ministry of Economic
Development compiles annual and quarterly national accounts data based on the System of
National Accounts 1993. Shortcomings include: inconsistency over time (the base year is often
changed without an overlap with the preceding base); inconsistency with balance of payments
statistics; weakness in inventory data; and lack of export and import price deflators.
Price statistics: The Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics (CAPMAS) disseminates a
monthly producer price index, as well as monthly consumer price index (CPI) data for Upper, Lower
and all Egypt. The CPI is compiled using expenditure weights derived from the 2008‒09 household
expenditure survey. In October 2009, the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) began releasing its measure
of core inflation, which excludes prices for the most volatile food items and regulated prices, and
issuing a monthly Inflation Note.
Government finance statistics: The authorities have largely adopted the classification of the
Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GSFM 2001), for revenue and expense transactions.
Nonetheless, data for general government operations (including budget sector, National
Investment Bank, and Social Insurance Funds) under the GFSM 2001 classification are incomplete.
The lack of a GFSM 2001 compliant presentation of transactions in assets and liabilities, other
economic flows, and stock positions limits fiscal analysis. Currently, data on external and domestic
public debt are compiled and disseminated separately by the CBE and Ministry of Finance. More
comprehensive coverage of government and government-guaranteed debt data within a single
database could help improve public debt management.
Monetary and financial statistics: Monthly monetary and financial statistics are comprehensive
and generally reported within two months after the reference period, but the coverage of data
should be expanded to include other financial corporations.
Financial sector surveillance: The CBE regularly publishes the financial soundness indicators on
its website, but the only aggregate banking sector data is publicly available. The banks’
exposure to the large State-owned enterprises remains non-transparent.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

7

ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT

External sector statistics: The CBE compiles balance of payments statistics based on the Balance
of Payments Manual, Fifth Edition (BPM5), and publishes Egypt’s Reserve Template on the IMF’s
website since 2009. Previous assessments noted some shortcomings in balance of payments
statistics, which have only partially been addressed, including (i) source data that do not reasonably
approximate an accrual basis; (ii) unreliable merchandise trade statistics from customs declarations
compelling compilers to estimate using banks’ foreign exchange records; and (iii) limited coverage
and classification of foreign exchange transactions.
METAC missions to the CBE and Ministry of Investment have provided advice on the measurement
of foreign direct investment (FDI), and the development of an FDI survey and business register.
The CBE publishes the international investment position, but some shortcomings remain to be
addressed to connect stocks with flows, improve the reporting system on nonguaranteed debt,
and address issues related to residency criteria.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation
with the Arab Republic of Egypt
On January 28, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with the Arab Republic of Egypt.
Following four years of political uncertainty and economic slowdown, the authorities have
started implementing policies to raise growth, create jobs and restore macroeconomic stability.
To achieve inclusive growth and job creation, the authorities are pursuing structural reforms,
promoting investment, and developing measures to protect the poor. To restore macroeconomic
stability, they are designing an ambitious fiscal adjustment, supported by tight monetary policy
to contain inflation.
The starting point is difficult. The political turmoil of 2011 triggered a sharp capital account
reversal and left growth depressed, while policy accommodation widened fiscal and external
imbalances. For the last four years, growth has been only 2 percent on average, and the
unemployment rate has risen to over 13 percent. Poverty increased to 26.3 percent in 2012/13.
Fiscal deficits have been above 10 percent of GDP since 2011, and have been largely financed
domestically, thereby contributing to the relatively high level of inflation; general government
debt reached 90.5 percent of GDP in mid-2014. Political uncertainties have weighed on both
tourism and capital flows, leading to a decline in reserves from 6.8 months of imports in
mid-2010 to 2½ months of imports in December 2014. Nevertheless, the banking system,
starting from a relatively strong position, has been resilient to the shocks and has maintained
profitability, low non-performing loans, and high liquidity.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country’s economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2
The measures implemented so far, along with some recovery in confidence, are starting to
produce a turnaround. As the authorities implement policy initiatives, prospects for growth,
employment, and macroeconomic stability will improve. Growth is projected to reach
3.8 percent in 2014/15 and to rise steadily to 5 percent over the medium term, which would
create jobs and reduce unemployment.
Fiscal consolidation will bring the budget deficit below 8 percent of GDP by 2018/19 and set
government debt on a downward path. The adjustment is designed to preserve growth and
inclusiveness: it accommodates the increase in spending on health, education, and scientific
research mandated by the constitution, reforms subsidies to make them more efficient and
equitable, raises taxes on high earners, and strengthens social safety nets through the
development of cash transfer systems. Lower fiscal deficits will support the targeted reduction in
inflation to 7 percent over the medium term. The authorities aim to increase reserves to the
equivalent of 3 months of imports by the end of 2014/15 and 3½ months of imports over the
medium term, although continued external financing will be needed to achieve these goals.
Egypt is vulnerable to adverse global economic developments, regional security risks, domestic
shocks and possible policy slippages, but upside risks could also materialize from a successful
implementation of the authorities’ policies and reforms.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed this first Article IV consultation since the events of 2011, noting
the significance of economic developments and policies in Egypt for its people and for the
region. Directors welcomed the improved economic outlook and supported the authorities’ plans
to restore macroeconomic stability and spur inclusive growth and employment. They
underscored the importance of policies to restore growth, create jobs, and protect the poor. They
viewed reforms of the regulatory framework for businesses and investment and financial sector
development as critical to encourage open competition and unlock private sector-led growth.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ focus on improving infrastructure and reforming the energy
sector. They stressed that investment should be designed to create jobs in the short term and
increase potential growth and exports in the long term. Directors agreed that limited public
resources and an already high public debt call for a careful design and monitoring of projects to
avoid actual or contingent liabilities.
2

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

3

Directors welcomed the authorities’ policies to protect the poor. They supported the launch of a
new cash transfer scheme and the reform of food ration cards, together with the government’s
commitment to further improve targeting and increase benefits. They considered that the increase
in public spending on education, health, and research, if managed wisely, can improve the
quality and availability of public services and support long-term inclusive growth.
Directors underscored that fiscal consolidation is essential for macroeconomic stability and
medium-term sustainability. They commended the authorities for the recent measures to increase
revenues and contain spending, especially the fuel subsidy reform that began in 2014. Directors
stressed the importance of maintaining the pace of reforms to set the public debt-to-GDP ratio on
a declining path. In this regard, they agreed on the need to broaden tax revenues and control
current spending, including by enacting swiftly a modern VAT and continuing reforms of
subsidies and of public sector wage-setting and hiring. For energy subsidies, Directors
emphasized that the recent decline in oil prices provides an opportunity to accelerate reforms.
Directors noted that fiscal consolidation would support the Central Bank of Egypt’s objective of
bringing inflation down to single digits.
Directors considered that while the envisaged policy adjustment would strengthen the balance of
payments, financing needs would remain in the medium term. Therefore, a combination of
further adjustment and financing would be needed. Directors saw a more flexible exchange rate,
reflecting supply and demand and consistent with an adequate level of reserves, as a way to
improve the availability of foreign exchange for households and businesses, strengthen
competitiveness, support the current account, and attract foreign direct investment. In this regard,
they welcomed the recent movements in the exchange rate as an important step in the right
direction.
Directors noted that the economic situation remains difficult given regional and domestic
security risks. In view of these risks, Directors stressed the importance of building confidence
and creating adequate buffers by implementing swiftly the reform agenda, strengthening
international reserves, and preparing contingency plans for the budget.

Statement by Hazem Beblawi, Executive Director for the Arab Republic of Egypt
Executive Board Meeting
January 28, 2015
1.
This is a moment of opportunity for Egypt. With relative political stability restored
Egypt is moving resolutely to invigorate the economy. While recognizing the full range of
socio-economic challenges, the authorities are keen to strengthen economic prospects and
improve the well being of all Egyptians. Accordingly, steps were immediately undertaken by
the new government to begin structural reforms and promote investment, starting with a
2014/15 budget that aims to adjust spending allocations, contains the fiscal deficit to
eventually bring down public debt, and is supported by monetary policies to contain inflation.
Investment promotion and job creation are key priorities, to be anchored in
fundamental economic reforms and a predictable and competitive investment environment.
To this end, the March Conference in Sharm El Sheikh will bring together investors to
participate in projects that aim to reinvigorate the Egyptian economy.
2.
The authorities broadly share staff’s overall assessment of long-standing challenges
facing the Egyptian economy. However, they differ on specific areas of the assessment
related to the prospects, risks, and resilience of the Egyptian economy. They anticipate a
stronger turnaround in business confidence and a larger role for investment flows. The
authorities appreciate the diligent work of the team, constructive spirit of the discussions, and
their openness to different perspectives and to adjusting some of their assumptions and
previous perceptions.
Outlook
3.
A turnaround in growth is clearly visible, helped by an improved sense of security,
and a return to normalcy on the streets and in everyday life. Following four years of growth
averaging 2 percent, the pace of economic activity is expected to double in 2014/15, and to
further increase thereafter. Growth rebounded to 6.8 percent y-o-y in Q3 of 2014 with a
strong pickup in manufacturing and tourism. The authorities recognize the merits of starting
from conservative growth projections. However, they see scope for a stronger growth
rebound from the energy sector, new project investments, tourism, communications, and
construction. They also anticipate a more positive spillover from the impact of lower oil
prices on economic activity in Egypt’s trading partners.

2

4.
The authorities are well aware of the challenges and risks. They see limited risks from
policy delays, given the stakes at hand and the current social and political acceptance of the
necessity of reforms. Indeed, for the first time in Egypt, there is a clear national consensus on
the need to implement reforms that would achieve more inclusive growth and strengthen the
economy’s resilience to external shocks. The authorities anticipate a boost to medium-term
growth from investment in industrial projects, energy generation, superhighways, social
sectors, as well as regulatory reforms to facilitate startups, and support to small and medium
enterprises. The Suez Canal Regional Development project, the flagship of the government’s
investment recovery program, will provide many opportunities for investors as it sets the stage
to enlarge and cement Egypt’s role as a global trading and logistics hub. Plans include
four new seaports in the three provinces surrounding the canal, a new airport, a new
industrial zone west of the Gulf of Suez and a “technology valley” in Ismailia.
Fiscal Policy
5.
The authorities’ commitment to restoring fiscal sustainability is unwavering as they
see the planned large fiscal consolidation as unavoidable. All the gains that were made in
reducing the large fiscal deficits in the years prior to the global financial crisis have since
been reversed. Debt has increased by one third and the budget sector’s gross financing needs
have nearly tripled. In 2013/14, the budget deficit peaked due to revenue shortfalls associated
with the petroleum sector, and two stimulus packages that raised infrastructure and social
spending. This included allocations for increases in cash transfers, low income housing, and
public transport. Additional fiscal savings will be needed to accommodate the floor on public
spending on health and education, as mandated in the new constitution.
6.
This year’s budget targets a deficit of 10 percent of GDP. They agree with staff’s
assessment that the budget strikes the right balance between moving toward fiscal
sustainability, supporting the recovery, and improving social conditions. The budget
incorporates subsidy cuts through the fuel price increases of 40-80 percent that were
implemented last July, gas price increases to households by over 200 percent, as well as tax
measures on dividends and capital gains, implementation of a new property tax, income taxes
at the higher income brackets, and excises on tobacco and alcohol, which together yield 2½
percent of GDP. Measures were also introduced to contain the public wage bill, and an
overhaul of the public pay system is under consideration. Additional measures are planned
for later this year and in next year’s budget with a view to reduce the deficit to 8 percent of
GDP and to bring government debt to a declining path, reaching 80-85 percent of GDP
within five years. The pace of fiscal consolidation is calibrated to limit the adverse impact on
growth and on lower income groups, as recognized in the staff report.
7.
An important element of the fiscal strategy is to reform the subsidy system. In this
connection, the new food ration cards were well-received and are already yielding substantial
savings in food subsidy cost due to lower wheat consumption and better targeting. For

3
subsidized fuel, smart cards have been distributed and used in five governorates so far and are
being further extended to enable future targeting of fuel subsidies. The recent oil price decline
has substantially reduced the budgetary cost of fuel subsidies for this fiscal year.
However, the authorities recognize the possibility of a faster rebound of oil prices than is
implicit in futures prices. They have every intention to seize this opportunity to continue with
subsidy reforms and to further narrow the gap between retail prices and cost recovery.
Moreover, the authorities paid $3.5 billion in amounts due to foreign oil companies since July
which is leading to new investments. Power shortages will be addressed by new power
projects as well as inviting private sector participation to invest in renewable energy based on
a newly established feed-in tariff, which was three times over-subscribed.
Monetary, Exchange Rate, and Financial Sector Policies
8.
The Central Bank of Egypt’s (CBE) monetary and exchange rate policies seek to
gradually reduce inflation to maintain real incomes and enhance external competitiveness.
The Monetary Policy Committee of the CBE raised interest rates by 100 basis points in July
2014 in a courageous step to help contain the second round effects of the increase in fuel
prices as subsidies were cut. On January 15, 2015 the Committee cut the benchmark interest
rate 50 basis points reflecting an improved inflation outlook on the back of the drop in
international oil prices and the subsequent revision of food price forecasts. Monetary policy
will continue to aim at reducing inflation and closing the competitiveness gap with Egypt’s
trading partners.
9.
The CBE’s medium-term objective is to anchor low and stable inflation expectations,
while supporting growth and employment. Since inflation in Egypt has been partly due to
domestic supply shocks and distribution problems, the CBE has highlighted the causes of
inflation in goods and services, particularly food, and the need to undertake structural
reforms to ease bottlenecks and improve competition.
10.
The CBE’s foreign exchange rate policy is geared toward achieving a flexible
exchange rate that reflects the underlying forces of supply and demand and is consistent with
an adequate level of reserves, while avoiding excess volatility. The CBE has conducted the
foreign exchange auctions with a view to maintain an orderly foreign exchange market.
Following a period of stability, the exchange rate depreciated in the central bank auctions by
3½ percent in the week of January 18, 2015. The CBE expects to benefit from returning
capital inflows, particularly in the form of foreign direct investment, given renewed
confidence in the economy. FDI and tourism have already begun to recover and they expect a
more positive impact on the balance of payments than assumed in staff’s projections. The
authorities consider imports and exports relatively inelastic to the exchange rate as exports are
constrained by non price factors and given the large share of wheat and intermediate inputs in
imports. Indeed, the large depreciations of the REER in 2003 were not followed by a
strong response in net exports, as seen in the fourth panel of Figure 1. The authorities are
concerned that the exchange rate assessment, as presented in the staff appraisal and in the

4
report and Appendix, could lead to undue pressures on the currency despite known problems
with these methodologies.
11.
The banking system’s resilience remains intact, in spite of the economic slowdown
associated with a prolonged political transition, as confirmed by robust and improving
financial soundness indicators. They welcome the staff’s confirmation of banking sector
soundness and effective supervision. Building on the far-reaching reforms over the past
decade, profitability continues to improve and nonperforming loans further decline, while
provisioning coverage has reached 98 percent. The CBE’s regularly conducted stress tests
indicate that plausible losses could be absorbed by banks’ profits and capital buffers.
Structural Reforms for Sustainable Growth
12.
The authorities’ blueprint aims to raise Egypt’s growth potential and medium-term
growth rates to levels that meaningfully lower unemployment and raise the standards of
living of all Egyptians. They appreciate the staff report’s emphasis on the importance of
these objectives. To complement measures to restore macroeconomic stability, the authorities’
initiatives give priority to enhancing financial inclusion and improving the
business climate. A new microfinance law and plans to develop mobile banking will enhance
access to financial services. Efforts are under way to tackle the regulatory and bureaucratic
obstacles that stand in the way of domestic and foreign investors, as well as policies to ensure
transparency and that the rule of law prevails. Accordingly, the authorities have recently
introduced amendments to the competition and anti-monopoly laws. They have taken steps to
remove legal hurdles facing private contracts with the government and will introduce
amendments to the investment law that will further streamline processes for foreign
investment. They are looking to the March conference as a landmark event to jumpstart
investment flows.
Selected Issues Paper
13.
The authorities welcome work that identifies the binding constraints to growth and
advice that specifies and prioritizes structural reform recommendations, as intended by the
“Growth Diagnostics” approach. They do not disagree with most of the views in the Selected
Issues Paper. However, they would have welcomed more empirical evidence on some stated
views, further prioritizing of reforms, and a clearer connection with paragraph 42 of the staff
appraisal. In the table on the most problematic factors for doing business in Egypt, which is
based on perceptions survey data from the World Economic Forum, the rankings fluctuate
widely from year to year, with the exception of political stability and access to finance,
making it difficult to draw conclusions.
Egypt is a founding member of the Fund and looks forward to continued close collaboration
with the institution. The authorities value the professional work of the staff and appreciate
the excellent and timely technical assistance.
