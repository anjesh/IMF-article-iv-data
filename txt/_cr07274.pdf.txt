EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background
South Africa’s recent economic performance has been strong. Real GDP growth has been
robust, employment has risen, the fiscal position has strengthened further, and the country
has continued to bolster its international reserves. Strong domestic demand, however, led to a
widening of the external current account deficit, which was financed by portfolio inflows.
Also, inflation pressures intensified, leading to a recent breach of the inflation target band.
The economic outlook is largely positive, with short-term risks arising mainly from a
possible worsening of the external environment. Unemployment and poverty remain major
challenges.
Policy discussions
Staff supported the authorities’ overall strategy, which seeks to spur growth and reduce
unemployment and poverty while preserving macroeconomic stability.
Staff agreed with the Reserve Bank that the inflation risks were on the upside, and
considered that a tightening of monetary policy could be needed. In the event, the policy
interest rate was raised in June, following the breach of the band with April inflation data.
The authorities remain committed to the flexible exchange rate regime, intervening only to
gradually build up reserves, a policy supported by staff. Staff also supported the ongoing
relaxation of capital controls, and favored reducing administrative compliance costs.
Staff agreed with the thrust of the government fiscal plans, including boosting investment in
infrastructure and selected social programs, but favored maintaining a neutral fiscal stance in
the next few years, which would imply a moderately lower rate of expenditure growth than
currently planned. The government is developing a major social security reform.
The banking system is sound and well regulated. The authorities are well aware of the risks
arising from rapid credit growth, and staff suggested steps to further enhance the monitoring
framework. There is progress in improving access to banking services by the poor.
Staff supported the efforts to identify and address constraints on growth under the
Accelerated and Shared Growth Initiative for South Africa. Although the volatility of the
rand has been identified as a possible constraint, there was agreement that the current flexible
exchange rate system should be maintained. Competitiveness concerns would continue to be
addressed by measures to raise productivity and reduce costs.
Staff supported efforts to increase employment, and favored the identification and revision of
labor market regulations and practices that limit job creation. Staff also recommended further
trade liberalization and simplification of the trade regime. South Africa’s strong economic
performance in recent years has benefited the wider region.
Staff supported the official initiatives to address wide income and wealth disparities.

I. RECENT ECONOMIC AND POLICY DEVELOPMENTS
1.
South Africa has made significant economic progress in the past decade. After
sluggish growth in the early years of the political transformation, the country started to reap
the benefits of sustained good macroeconomic management and structural reforms, recently
supported by favorable external conditions. The economy is undergoing its longest expansion
on record, and in recent years has experienced elevated growth in an environment of rapid
credit expansion, booming asset prices, strengthening public finances, and rising
international reserves financed by large capital inflows. At the same time, however, the
external current account has widened markedly, and inflation pressures have recently
intensified.

The expansion in economic activity lifted employment, which rose by 4.1 percent
in the year to September 2006. The unemployment rate, however, declined only modestly,
to 25½ percent, as labor force participation rose significantly. Remuneration per employee in
the formal nonagricultural sector rose by

and December by a cumulative 200 basis points, to 9 percent.1 Following a pause in the
tightening cycle, an unexpectedly large jump in inflation to 6.3 percent in April led to an
upward revision in the MPC’s inflation outlook and an ensuing 50 bps increase in the repo
rate in June.
5.
The SARB maintains a flexible
exchange-rate system, while building up
international reserves. The SARB has a
publicly-announced policy of intervening in
the foreign exchange market only to
purchase foreign exchange to gradually
bolster its reserve position. By May 2007,
gross reserves reached US$27.9 billion,
equivalent to about 200 percent of shortterm external debt, or 3.4 months of imports
of goods and services.
6.
After depreciating markedly in
mid-2006, the rand has fluctuated
without a defined trend. Like other
emerging market currencies, the rand came
under pressure following global financial
market turbulence in May-June 2006, and
depreciated by 10.6 percent in real effective
terms between end-2005 and July 2006.
Since then, the weakening effect of the
rising current account deficit on the rand has
been broadly offset by renewed strength in
commodity prices and widening interest
differentials with the U.S. and the Euro area.

investment perspective, investment rose by 2¼ percentage points of GDP and national
savings declined slightly (with an increase in public savings partially offsetting a fall in
private savings). The current account deficit was financed by portfolio inflows, mainly
equity. External debt rose, but remains at modest levels of 22½ percent of GDP, with
37 percent of this debt being denominated in rand.
8.
Reflecting strong tax revenues, the
national government’s fiscal balance
yielded a surplus of 0.6 percent of GDP in
FY2006/07 after recording a deficit of
0.3 percent of GDP a year earlier. As in
recent years, booming demand and greater
efficiency in tax collection contributed to
large revenue gains beyond budgeted levels.
On the expenditure side, a rise in social
spending was broadly offset by a decline in
interest payments and other spending. By
end-2006, government debt had declined to
about 31 percent of GDP.

Asset prices continued to rise strongly in 2006 and 2007. The Johannesburg Stock
Exchange all-share index surged by 40½ percent in the 12 months through May 2007, driven
by strong commodity prices, favorable growth prospects, and positive assessments from
rating agencies. Residential property prices also continued to rise, by 15½ percent in the
12 months to May 2007.

II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
11.
The authorities’ main objectives are to accelerate growth and reduce
unemployment and poverty within a stable macroeconomic environment. The
government’s Accelerated and Shared Growth Initiative for South Africa (ASGISA) seeks to
relax key binding constraints on growth, and aims to achieve average growth rates of at least
4½ percent in 2005–09 and 6 percent in 2010–14, and halve the unemployment and poverty
rates by 2014 from 2004 levels. Against this background, discussions with the authorities
focused on the economic outlook and risks; policies to maintain macroeconomic and
financial stability; structural reforms to raise growth and reduce unemployment; and regional
implications of South Africa’s developments and policies.
Box 1. Summary of Previous Consultation Discussions
Macroeconomic policies. There has been broad agreement on policies, as the Fund has
generally supported the authorities’ views on fiscal policy, inflation targeting, exchange rate
policies, international reserves management, and exchange control liberalization.
Structural policies. The Fund has supported South Africa’s fiscal and financial sector reforms,
trade liberalization, and initiatives to reduce unemployment. It also encouraged identifying and
revising aspects of labor legislation that constrain job creation, but progress in this area has
been difficult. The Fund considered that privatization, within a proper regulatory framework,
could help enhance the efficiency of state-owned enterprises, but the authorities favored
instead the restructuring of the large enterprises, together with the sale of their noncore assets.
The Fund has also recommended further liberalization and simplification of the trade regime;
while there has been some progress, the authorities indicated that decisions on the tariff
structure would depend on the outcome of the Doha round and the conclusions of their
industrial policy review.

A. Outlook and Risks
12.
The authorities and staff agreed that near-term economic prospects are broadly
favorable. A broad range of indicators point to continued robust output growth, and the
external environment is expected to remain benign. Staff’s baseline scenario envisages
output growth of 4¾ percent in 2007 and 4½ percent in 2008, the latter being somewhat
below government projections. Inflation is expected to remain above the upper limit of the
target band in the near term. Continued strength of domestic demand would keep the current
account deficit relatively high, above 6 percent of GDP in 2007 and 2008.
13.
The main downside risks to the near-term outlook are a possible deterioration of
the global environment and the potentially excessive pace of domestic demand. Weaker
appetite for emerging market assets, or a substantial rise in global interest rates, could reduce
capital inflows to South Africa, prompting a sharp depreciation of the rand and thus

9
additional interest rate increases to keep inflation in the band. Household balance sheets
would deteriorate, as mortgages at variable interest rates have grown strongly, potentially
contributing to dampening growth. Also, a negative supply shock in world oil markets could
slow growth globally, and in South Africa, especially if accompanied by a sharp fall in
commodity prices. The widening current account deficit and high reliance on portfolio
inflows have raised vulnerability to external shocks, particularly a “sudden stop” in capital
inflows (Box 2). However, the country’s strong fundamentals, including low external debt, a
solid and improving reserves position, a sound financial sector, and adherence to a flexible
exchange rate, should help limit the adverse impact of these shocks on the economy. The
authorities agreed that the widening current account deficit implied some risks, but
considered that South Africa would likely continue to attract significant capital inflows in the
years ahead, especially given the abundant global liquidity. On the domestic front, staff
considered that the continued rapid growth in domestic demand, in combination with
capacity constraints—as evidenced for instance by the record high manufacturing capacity
utilization, and emerging scarcity of energy, cement, and steel—could lead to further
widening of the current account deficit and intensifying price pressures.
14.
Staff envisages potential real GDP growth gradually rising over the medium
term to about 5 percent. In this scenario, rapidly growing investment would relieve the
most pressing capacity constraints—especially in electricity and transport networks—
allowing faster sustainable growth than hitherto (text table). Other productivity-boosting
reforms, including under ASGISA, would also contribute to the pick-up in potential growth.
At 4¾ percent, average projected growth in 2007–12 would be slightly lower than potential
growth, as the present positive output gap closes over that period. The external current
account deficit would gradually narrow to around 4½ percent of GDP by 2012, although
risks of a higher deficit remain if growth continues to be driven by domestic demand. The
National Treasury projects sustained output growth rates above 5 percent in coming years
under the assumption of higher potential growth than estimated by staff, resulting from more
optimistic projected increases in fixed capital formation and employment, as well as the
continuation of the very strong TFP growth experienced in recent years.

Box 2. Assessing the Risks from South Africa’s Current Account Deficit 1
Following a sharp swing from a small surplus in 2002 to a deficit of 6.5 percent of GDP in 2006,
South Africa’s current account balance is now something of an outlier among non-European
emerging market economies (EMEs). Moreover, while many European EMEs (such as Turkey and
Hungary) also have large current account deficits, a relatively larger share of their deficits are covered
by direct investment inflows, which are considered a stable form of financing. South Africa, by contrast,
is unusually reliant on portfolio equity inflows to finance its deficit (figure).

An examination of the factors contributing to, and financing, the deficit yields several insights:
• The deficit reflects a private sector savingsinvestment imbalance (i.e., not fiscal origin).
• Rising investment appears to be an increasingly
important driver of the imbalance (figure).
• The stock of external liabilities is low by EME
standards; sizeable deficits for several years would
be needed to push external liabilities to worrisome
levels (figure).

• Recent developments indicate that the near-term
-100
outlook for portfolio inflows to South Africa is
-120
broadly favorable. In the year to early June,
nonresident purchases of equities and bonds have amounted to about 2¼ percent of annual GDP. A J.P.
Morgan survey also suggests that investors are underweight in South African equities relative to a
neutral global portfolio allocation.
While these factors provide some reassurance that the current account position may not be an
immediate threat, deficit levels of 6-6½ percent, financed by portfolio inflows, will continue to
leave South Africa exposed to a “sudden stop” in capitals flows. Strong fundamentals are already in
place that should help to limit the consequences of a sudden stop. Other policy measures, such as further
accumulation of reserves, continued improvements in the structure of external debt, and reforms to
enhance the flexibility and openness of the economy, might also help to reduce the likelihood and the
costs of a sudden stop.2

15.
South Africa’s debt position appears sustainable under a variety of shocks. In
stress tests conducted by staff, government debt remains below 30 percent of GDP and
external debt stays below 25 percent of GDP (Appendix I). Even with a current account
deficit wider than projected by 1 percentage point of GDP in each year in the 2007-12
period, external debt would stay below 30 percent of GDP in all scenarios.
B. Preserving Macroeconomic and Financial Stability
Monetary Policy
16.
During the discussions, both the SARB and staff saw upside risks to the inflation
outlook. Staff noted that SARB projections at the time of the April MPC meeting showed a
significant probability that inflation would breach the upper limit of the band for several
quarters, and thus considered that some tightening may be needed to anchor inflation
expectations well inside the band and prevent second-round effects from recent rises in fuel
and food prices. SARB officials agreed fully on the importance of anchoring inflation
expectations and addressing second-round effects, but had not seen compelling evidence in
these areas. They noted, for example, that while forward-looking projections of inflation had
shown inflation rising to the top of the band temporarily, measured price expectations
appeared to be well-grounded. The MPC had therefore elected to “wait and see” how the
200 bps tightening in the second half of 2006 worked its way through the economy.

Represents the spread between CPI-indexed bonds and regular bonds. The difference between CPI and CPIX
inflation has lately been in the 1/2 to 3/4 percentage point range.

17.
On June 7, the MPC raised the repo rate by 50 basis points to 9½ percent.
Information available after the mission revealed an unexpectedly sharp jump in inflation in
April. The MPC indicated that updated forecasts showed a deteriorated inflation outlook,
with the baseline projection showing CPIX inflation marginally above the ceiling of the
target band for most of the next several quarters. It also underscored that risks were strongly
on the upside and that it would not hesitate to tighten policy further if necessary.

12
Exchange Rate Policy, Reserve Accumulation, and Exchange Controls
18.
There was agreement that the flexible exchange rate system should be
maintained. The current system is an integral part of the inflation targeting regime and helps
provide a cushion against external shocks.
19.
Staff found no strong evidence of any significant exchange rate misalignment.
This assessment was based on the results of the most recent CGER (Consultative Group on
Exchange Rate Issues) exercise and on additional work by staff (Box 3). While indicators
based on the analysis of the current account pointed to a moderate overvaluation, those based
on the relationship between the exchange rate and economic fundamentals pointed to an
undervaluation. The authorities agreed that it was difficult to estimate an equilibrium value
for the rand.
Box 3. Estimates of the Equilibrium Exchange Rate
The IMF’s CGER exercise uses three approaches to assess the exchange rates of
advanced and emerging market economies (see Methodology for CGER Exchange Rate
Assessments, available at www.imf.org). As of February 2007, the two indirect methods based
on evaluations of the current account, the external sustainability approach and the macro
balance approach, suggested overvaluation of the rand in the 10-15 percent range. The direct,
equilibrium REER approach, indicates an undervaluation of the rand of over 30 percent; the
CGER exercise disregards this estimate because of data shortcomings.
The results from these types of analysis are sensitive to changes in specification. In the
sustainability approach, if one wanted to stabilize South Africa’s NFA at the average level for
emerging market economies (instead of South Africa’s much stronger level), the estimated
overvaluation of the rand would be cut in half. Re-estimating the macro balances equation with
only emerging market economies rather than a mix of advanced and emerging countries
reduces the estimated overvaluation by about 1/3 as well. Re-estimating the equilibrium REER
approach using only South African data (rather than panel data) and a somewhat different set
of fundamentals would yield an undervaluation of less than half the size of the CGER estimate.

20.
Staff supported the SARB’s current policy of gradual accumulation of reserves.
While there is no specific target for the level of reserves, the policy aims at bringing reserves
holdings broadly in line with those of other emerging markets. In relation to other countries,
South Africa’s holdings are broadly comfortable in terms of short-term external debt, but
relatively low in terms of other indicators (table). Also, South Africa’s holdings are markedly
above the 100 percent of short-term external debt benchmark, but still below the sum of

13
short-term external debt plus the current account deficit, another commonly used
benchmark.2 On that basis, staff agreed that some further accumulation would be beneficial.

21.
The authorities continue to relax exchange controls gradually. Remaining
controls apply to capital outflows by residents, and mainly comprise limits on overseas
investment by institutional investors, the prohibition of portfolio investment abroad by
corporates, and limits on offshore investment by individuals. Staff supported the relaxation
of controls, as it allows for a better allocation of resources, and, by deepening the foreign
exchange market, could help reduce exchange rate volatility over the medium term. Staff
favored simplifying the administration of controls—for instance, replacing prior
authorization with reporting requirements for investments within the allowed limits—to
reduce compliance costs.
Fiscal Policy
22.
South Africa’s fiscal position is strong. Over the last few years, large revenue
gains from robust economic growth and improved revenue administration more than offset
the impact of high expenditure growth on the fiscal balance. Despite capacity constraints at
subnational levels, expenditure has generally been well targeted at social and infrastructure
needs.

2

Reserves holdings are also above the “optimal level” estimated using the model in Jeanne, O., and R. Ranciere
(2006), “The Optimal Level of International Reserves for Emerging Market Countries: Formulas and
Applications,” IMF Working Paper 06/229.

14
23.
The authorities envisage a broadly balanced budget in coming years. In official
projections, continued strong revenues would keep the national government’s budget surplus
at 0.6 percent of GDP in fiscal year 2007/8. Only modest deficits are projected for
subsequent years, despite planned further rapid increases in noninterest expenditure over the
medium term (7¾ percent a year in real terms) to relieve infrastructure bottlenecks and social
needs, and to prepare for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Government debt would fall
considerably over the medium term. Staff projections suggest moderately stronger fiscal
outcomes than official projections in coming years, mainly on account of higher revenue.
24.
Staff and the authorities exchanged views on the contribution of fiscal policy to
demand management. On the basis of staff estimates, the fiscal stance would remain neutral
in 2007/8 and turn expansionary afterwards (table).3 Staff supported the thrust of the
government’s fiscal plans but suggested that maintaining a neutral stance in coming years
may be more appropriate given the concerns arising from the current account deficit. Even if
revenues were higher than officially forecasted—as staff projected—a neutral stance would
require a moderately lower (but still ample) average growth in expenditure than currently
planned.4 The authorities agreed that fiscal policy needed to be sensitive to the risks arising
from external imbalances, and pointed to recent improvements in the fiscal stance in this
regard. They added that the stance of fiscal policy would also remain mindful of the need for
increased public spending to meet important social and investment priorities.

25.
The authorities have launched an initiative to reform social security. It
envisages a mandatory multi-pillar scheme covering old-age pensions, unemployment
insurance, and death and disability benefits. Planned for 2010, the scheme would be funded
by a payroll tax, while the budget would separately provide for a wage subsidy for low-wage
earners to partly offset the associated increase in labor cost. The authorities explained that

Staff estimates that maintaining a neutral fiscal stance through 2009/10 would imply an average real
expenditure growth rate of 6¼ percent, compared with the planned 7¾ percent.

15
key features of the new system were still under study and remained to be discussed with
stakeholders. Staff supported the goal of strengthening old-age income security, and
concurred with the authorities on the need to proceed with caution due to the complexities of
this undertaking and its potential effects on labor costs and work incentives. Staff also
considered it important that the reform should ensure the full funding of liabilities, and, more
broadly, limit possible adverse effects on the public finances, a view shared by the
authorities.
26.
Treasury officials and staff discussed the pros and cons of increasing reliance
on consumption taxation relative to corporate and personal income taxation in the
medium term. Staff considered that such a shift could reduce the variability of tax revenue
and strengthen incentives to invest and work, but that it would require improving targeted
social assistance to offset the impact of higher consumption taxes on the poor. The officials
noted that the bases of VAT and excise taxes are already relatively broad with few
exemptions. To generate significant further revenue from these taxes would, therefore,
require an increase in their respective tax rates. They further noted that at present it might be
difficult to introduce effective mechanisms to compensate many of the poor households
adversely affected by such rebalancing. Staff suggested further study of these issues.
Financial Sector
27.
South Africa’s financial system is generally sound and well regulated. The
banking sector is adequately capitalized and profitable, with an average capital adequacy
ratio of 12.7 percent and a nonperforming loan ratio of 1.1 percent as of early 2007 (Table 7).
Among the large banks—accounting for 84 percent of the sector in terms of assets—
exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks is limited, and incipient securitization
has contributed to improving balance sheet management. Banks expect to comply with the
January 1, 2008 deadline for implementation of Basel II principles; the new regime is
expected to have a neutral effect on their capital adequacy ratios. Pension funds, collective
investment schemes and insurance companies have also performed well on the back of rising
domestic asset prices, and compliance with prudential requirements remains strong.
28.
While welcoming the developmental benefits of recent rapid credit expansion,
the authorities and staff agreed that it also created risks.5 Driven by buoyant credit and
interest rate hikes in 2006, the ratio of debt service to income for households has risen,
although it remains below historical highs for South Africa. While the bulk of credit growth
takes the form of secured lending, the authorities have expressed concerns about the
vulnerability of new borrowers, and there have been signs of some moderate deterioration in
asset quality. In this regard, the recent entry into effect of the National Credit Act, although
5

See Chapter III of the Selected Issues Paper.

16
likely to lengthen slightly the foreclosure process for nonperforming loans, is expected to
increase banks’ ability to assess the creditworthiness of individual households and limit risks
from household credit.6
29.
In the context of rapid credit growth, further enhancements to the regulatory
and monitoring framework could be considered. Staff recommended: (i) collecting and
regularly analyzing data on the distribution of household debt by income category, as
aggregate numbers may mask pockets of weakness; (ii) conducting periodic stress tests on
individual bank data—in addition to system-wide tests—encompassing credit, interest rate,
liquidity and foreign exchange risks; (iii) monitoring more closely the effects of asset price
developments on mortgage credit, including on the rate of re-mortgaging by households to
finance consumption; and (iv) reinforcing prudential standards, such as on loan-to-value and
debt service-to-income ratios.7 The authorities broadly agreed with the recommendations,
while indicating that implementation would need to take into account potential compliance
costs, particularly given the ongoing intense preparations for Basel II.
30.
Staff discussed progress with financial development and regulatory issues.
Access to financial services is expanding, as the share of South Africa’s population who do
not benefit from formal financial services has declined to an estimated 49 percent in 2006
from 55 percent in 2004. Commitments under the Financial Sector Charter (FSC) have
allowed the rapid expansion of low cost (“Mzansi”) accounts, and introduction of money
transfer facilities and insurance products, thus increasing access to basic financial services.
The authorities also plan the introduction of a regulatory framework for cooperative and
dedicated banks with the aim of further enhancing access to financial services.8
31.
The authorities confirmed their interest in an FSAP update for South Africa in
early 2008. Such an exercise could provide considerable benefits in view of the significant
developments in the financial sector since the initial FSAP in 2001.

6

The National Credit Act regulates the granting of consumer credit by all credit providers, including banks,
microlenders, and retailers, to both enhance consumer protection and bolster banks’ ability to manage their
exposure to individual household risks.

7

8

Recent country experiences suggest the adoption of maximum loan-to-value ratios in the 70-80 percent range.

The dedicated banks bill aims at creating opportunities for existing banks and entities such as large retailers of
the Post Office to offer basic banking services through separate entities.

17
C. Achieving Higher Growth
ASGISA
32.
ASGISA has identified six major constraints on growth: (i) the relative volatility
of the exchange rate; (ii) inadequate infrastructure and logistics; (iii) skills shortages;
(iv) barriers to entry and competition in key economic sectors; (v) the regulatory
environment, particularly the burden on small and medium enterprises (SMEs); and
(vi) capacity limitations within the government. These constraints are being addressed, but
most of them are outside the Fund’s core area of expertise.
33.
The authorities indicated that exchange rate volatility is being addressed
through sustained adherence to sound macroeconomic policies, assisted by a steady
build-up of foreign reserves. They, therefore, saw no need to depart from their current
exchange rate policy. Given concerns about exchange rate volatility, staff noted the practice
in some inflation targeting countries of announcing an explicit policy for intervening in the
foreign exchange market under extraordinary circumstances.9 Those countries specify
conditions under which the central bank might consider foreign exchange intervention to
calm nervous markets or signal large misalignments. If effective, such intervention could
limit overshooting and thus reduce currency volatility. Staff indicated, however, that the
track record of such policy was short and the ability to identify large misalignments was
limited, and thus determining whether a similar policy would be advisable for South Africa
required further analysis. The authorities were skeptical about the benefits of such policy in
South Africa, given doubts about the effectiveness of intervention in the rand market,
uncertainty about the appropriate level or range of the exchange rate to defend, and the
significant costs and viability of large-scale sterilized intervention. On this basis, the SARB
policy excludes commitments to support any particular level of the rand.
34.
Regarding infrastructure and logistic deficiencies, staff supported medium-term
investment plans and efforts to enhance the efficiency of state-owned enterprises
(SOEs). Work has progressed on several projects. In 2006, public enterprises raised their
investment by 19 percent in real terms, in addition to the 9¾ percent real growth in
government investment. In the medium term, energy and transportation SOEs plan further
sizable investment expansion to relieve bottlenecks in electricity, port, and railway networks.
Staff recommended that investment projects continue to be supported by ex-ante cost-benefit
analysis and take into account implementation capacity, particularly since a large part of the
program is to be undertaken by subnational governments and SOEs. The authorities noted
that major investment projects do undergo rigorous review, especially if a state guarantee is
requested. Moreover, they would like to increase the use of public-private partnerships
9

See Chapter II of the Selected Issues Paper.

18
(PPPs) to help relieve implementation constraints in municipalities, but that this approach
faced regulatory hurdles which would be addressed in the year ahead.
35.
Staff argued that the new industrial policy framework could introduce economic
distortions. The framework includes potentially conflicting objectives, and, while crosscutting interventions (such as enhancing competition policy and supporting research and
development) seem justifiable on economic grounds, the basis for sectoral interventions is
less well-founded. To avoid large distortions, it would be important that interventions be
based on identified market failures or regulatory needs, subject to independent evaluations,
and limited in duration.
Competitiveness

37.
The authorities are addressing competitiveness concerns through measures to
raise productivity and reduce costs. Under ASGISA, they are strengthening infrastructure
and logistics, with an emphasis on energy and transportation. Moreover, they are introducing
in pilot form the practice of conducting regulatory impact assessments of new legislation,
building capacity in local governments, and improving the skills of the labor force through
training of workers and facilitating the immigration of those with scarce skills.
Labor Market
38.
While employment growth has recently picked up, unemployment remains very
high. South Africa’s high unemployment is the result of several factors—some of them a
legacy of the apartheid—including: (i) rapid growth of female and unskilled labor supply,
together with a structural shift in labor demand towards skilled labor; (ii) long distances
between places of residence and places of work, which raise the cost of job search and
(perhaps together with the system of social grants) raise reservation wages; and (iii) labor
market regulations and practices that discourage job creation. The individual effect of these
factors is difficult to ascertain and merits further analysis.
39.
Staff supported current targeted initiatives to reduce unemployment. These
include skills development programs and public work programs. Staff suggested an
evaluation of the effectiveness of these initiatives to ensure that resources are allocated
efficiently. The authorities are also considering how best to reduce the complexity and delays
in labor arbitration procedures. Staff recommended that adjustments in officially determined
minimum wages and in public sector wages (the latter owing to its possible impact on private
wage settlements) take into account their potential effect on employment.
Trade Policy
40.
The process of trade liberalization has largely stalled in recent years. South
Africa made significant progress in reducing tariffs and simplifying the trade regime in the
mid-1990s, but relatively limited reform has occurred since then.10 Staff suggested further
lowering the overall level of protection and simplifying the tariff structure, for instance by
reducing the number of tariff bands and tariff peaks. The authorities saw some merit in
further liberalization, but argued that moves in this area needed to be informed by
developments in ongoing multilateral and regional trade negotiations and the emerging
industrial policy strategy, which seems to call for maintaining tariff protection on certain
sectors, while reducing tariffs on selected inputs.

10

In mid-2006, responding to a surge in imports, South Africa introduced quotas on imports of textiles and
clothing from China, which are to remain in place through end-2008.

20
41.
The authorities stressed their preference for multilateral liberalization, but saw
preferential trading arrangements as a useful second-best option. Partly as a result of
delays in negotiations under the Doha Round, South Africa and its partners in the Southern
African Customs Union (SACU) have been negotiating preferential trading agreements.11
Staff reiterated that these agreements should be broad-based, with simple and nonrestrictive
rules of origin, to limit trade diversion and complement multilateral liberalization.
42.
South Africa is negotiating a review of its Trade Development and Cooperation
Agreement (TDCA) with the European Union (EU). As South Africa’s SACU partners
(together with other African countries) are negotiating an Economic Partnership Agreement
(EPA) with the EU, it has been agreed that the TDCA and EPA negotiations will be
integrated into a single set of discussions. It is hoped that these negotiations will be
completed by end-year, but significant issues remain to be resolved. The authorities noted
that harmonization of the region’s trading relationship with the EU, its most important
external trading partner, would contribute to regional integration.
D. Regional Spillovers
43.
South Africa’s strong economic performance in recent years has benefited the
wider region (Box 4).12 The success of the SARB’s inflation targeting regime continues to
ensure that inflation remains relatively low and stable throughout the Common Monetary
Area (CMA).13 The depreciation of the rand over the past year has mitigated concerns about
competitiveness in Lesotho and Swaziland. The strength of domestic demand in South Africa
has brought large revenue windfalls to BLNS via the SACU revenue-sharing arrangements.
44.
South Africa has indicated that it wishes to revisit the existing SACU revenuesharing arrangements. The authorities expressed concerns about the equity of the current
arrangements. In view of possible moves to establish a broader customs union within the
Southern Africa Development Community (SADC), they also noted the desirability of
developing revenue-sharing arrangements that would facilitate the expansion of SACU.14
Staff agreed with the authorities that changes to the revenue-sharing arrangements could

South Africa’s expanding trade with and investment in the rest of sub-Saharan Africa is summarized in SubSaharan Africa Regional Economic Outlook, September 2006 (Box 2.3). The strong correlation between growth

inflation rates across the area differ by relatively modest
amounts (figure).

Southern African Development Community (SADC). South Africa is central to economic integration within
the SADC region, accounting for about 60 percent of all intra-SADC trade and 70 percent of its GDP. Outward
investment by South African companies is expanding and South African banks operate in all 14 SADC member
states.2 South Africa and BLNS have already eliminated tariffs on imports from the rest of SADC as part of
efforts to establish a SADC free trade area by 2008. In 2004, SADC Heads of State also agreed on plans to
deepen regional integration through the establishment of a customs union, common market and, ultimately,
monetary union. Implementation of this agenda will be challenging with a number of issues, including multiple
and overlapping memberships of regional groupings, still to be resolved.
Labor market linkages. South Africa continues to attract large numbers of workers from neighboring countries,
a pattern in place for decades. While data on labor inflows are generally poor, there are indications that labor
inflows have picked up in recent years, reflecting both the demand-pull effects of South Africa’s strong growth
and skill shortages and also the supply-push effects of economic turmoil in some countries, notably Zimbabwe.

22
45.
South Africa’s economic linkages with the rest of the region have grown
significantly, but there is scope for further expansion of ties beyond SACU. The
authorities see the expansion of trade and investment flows within SADC as an important
contribution to the region’s growth prospects, while noting that a significant push will be
needed to achieve SADC’s stated objective of a fully-functioning free trade area by end2008. Many further obstacles would need to be overcome to establish a SADC customs
union.
E. Equity Issues
46.
Staff expressed support for the government’s initiatives to reduce social and
wealth disparities. Progress in these areas is critical for strengthening social cohesion and
thus the government’s ability to advance economic reforms.
•

Black Economic Empowerment (BEE). This initiative operates primarily through
sector-specific voluntary “charters” that set targets for several empowerment indicators,
including black ownership, black participation in management, and skills development. The
government has recently enacted codes of good practice, which clarify implementation rules
and thus should significantly reduce uncertainty about this initiative for firms and investors.
•

Land reform. This initiative, launched in 1994, aims at transferring 30 percent of
commercial agricultural land to previously disadvantaged groups by 2014, but so far only
about 4 percent has been transferred. Regarding land restitution (return of land lost due to
racially discriminatory laws), the government will continue with its approach involving
negotiations with current owners, with resort to expropriation at fair value and according to
well-defined legal principles if negotiations reach a deadlock. Regarding land redistribution
(transfer of privately held land—not subject to restitution claims—supported by state
resources), the government is broadening its efforts. It has launched a state-led approach,
under which government agencies will proactively identify both land for redistribution and
the potential beneficiaries who would acquire this land with state financial support. This
initiative complements the previous beneficiary-driven approach, under which beneficiaries
identify land they want and then ask the state for financial support. Staff understands that the
acquisition of land for redistribution will continue to take place at prices freely negotiated
with current owners.
F. Other Issues
47.
The HIV/AIDS epidemic has adversely affected social indicators, such as child
mortality and life expectancy.15 The government’s HIV/AIDS program has become more
15

According to UN 2006 Report on the Global AIDS Epidemic, an estimated 17–21 percent of the adult
population are infected.

23
extensive in recent years. By late 2006, an estimated 225,000 people had started ARV
treatment under the public sector program (some 25–30 percent of the estimated number of
people in need of treatment), aided by active donor support. The government launched a new
national HIV/AIDS strategy in April 2007, aimed at halving the rate of new HIV infections
and expanding access to proper treatment to 80 percent of HIV positive cases by 2011. The
economic impact of HIV/AIDS is highly uncertain; a recent (2006) study by the Bureau of
Economic Research estimates a reduction of ½ percentage point in long-term GDP growth.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
48.
South Africa has made considerable economic progress in the past decade.
Sound macroeconomic management and structural reforms, supported in recent years by
favorable external conditions, have led to higher growth, lower and more stable inflation,
sound public finances, a healthy financial system, and stronger international reserves. South
Africa’s steady expansion has benefited the rest of the region.
49.
Recent economic performance has been strong, although the external current
account deficit has widened and inflation pressures have lately intensified. Output and
employment have continued to grow at a rapid pace by historical standards, and vibrant
economic activity has contributed to a fiscal surplus, the first in several decades. But surging
demand has produced a marked increase in the current account deficit, financed by portfolio
inflows, and inflation pressures have risen, reflecting supply shocks and the buoyant demand.
50.
The near-term outlook remains broadly positive, with downside risks arising
from possible external shocks and the continuing strong pace of domestic demand. On
the external side, the large current account deficit has raised the vulnerability to external
shocks, including a decline in capital flows to emerging markets. The country’s strong
fundamentals should help limit the impact of those shocks on the economy. The main
domestic risk is that demand, which is already pushing capacity constraints, would lead to
further widening of the current account deficit and additional price pressures.
51.
In view of the inflation outlook, the increase in the repo rate in June was
appropriate. While inflation pressures partly resulted from supply shocks to food and
energy prices, it is important that monetary policy act to contain their second-round effects
on other prices and keep inflation expectations anchored. As noted in the June MPC
statement, the risks to inflation are strongly on the upside, so further increases in the repo
rate may be needed to bring inflation back within the target band over the medium term.
52.
The flexible exchange-rate system, with foreign exchange purchased by the
Reserve Bank only to strengthen its international reserves, remains appropriate. The
floating exchange rate is an integral part of the inflation-targeting framework and helps the
economy adjust to shocks. While the uncertainty surrounding estimates of an equilibrium
exchange rate seems large, there is little conclusive evidence of any significant exchange-rate

24
misalignment. Competitiveness concerns should continue to be addressed by measures to
raise productivity and reduce costs. Gross international reserves have increased significantly
over the last years, but are still lagging behind those in other emerging markets according to
some benchmarks. Some further accumulation could thus be useful as a buffer against
external shocks.
53.
Continued progress in the relaxation of capital controls would be beneficial. It
would improve financial management by institutional investors, corporates, and individuals.
Simplifying the administration of existing controls would reduce compliance costs, for
instance by replacing prior authorization with reporting requirements.
54.
Fiscal policy is contributing to reducing macroeconomic risks, while addressing
development needs. With surpluses in the past and current fiscal years, fiscal policy is
appropriate in view of the large current account deficits. Going forward, keeping the fiscal
policy stance neutral would seem appropriate, until the current account deficit starts
declining. Vigorous expenditure expansion is targeted at relieving important infrastructure
bottlenecks and meeting pressing social needs. Success in the government’s efforts to
enhance implementation capacity at the subnational level would help achieve full and
efficient execution of these programs.
55.
The upcoming social security reform will be a major undertaking. The goal of
strengthening old-age income security is welcome. The authorities are fully aware that the
complexities of this effort and its potential effect on labor costs and work incentives call for
caution in design and implementation, to avoid discouraging formal employment. It will be
important to limit possible adverse effects on the public finances, including by ensuring full
funding of created liabilities.
56.
The financial system remains sound and well-regulated; the monitoring
framework could benefit from further enhancements given the rapid credit growth.
Major banks are actively preparing for the introduction of Basel II principles in 2008, and the
authorities are carefully monitoring financial stability risks. Monitoring could be
strengthened by regularly analyzing the distribution of household debt by income category
and conducting stress tests on individual bank data. In the current buoyant environment, it
would be important to consider reinforcing prudential standards on loan-to-value and debt
service-to-income ratios. The forthcoming FSAP update should be useful in taking stock of
developments in the past years and assessing the banking system’s vulnerability to shocks.
57.
The authorities’ development strategy, ASGISA, provides a valuable
coordinating framework for the government efforts to raise growth and reduce
unemployment and poverty. The emphasis on relieving infrastructure bottlenecks,
enhancing workers’ skills, and improving microeconomic conditions should go a long way
toward achieving those objectives. At the same time, it is important to avoid introducing
market distortions by limiting state interventions to cases of market failures or regulatory

25
gaps. While exchange rate volatility has been identified as a constraint on growth, the
authorities’ restatement of their position against trying to manage the exchange rate is
welcome.
58.
Additional labor market and trade reforms could contribute to raising growth.
The initiatives in place to reduce unemployment—by enhancing workers’ skills and
implementing public work programs—remain well grounded. At the same time, it would be
useful to identify and revise those labor market regulations and practices that discourage job
creation. South Africa implemented significant trade reforms in the 1990s, but additional
efforts to simplify the tariff structure and lower most favored nation tariff rates are
warranted.
59.
South Africa’s strong economic performance in recent years has benefited the
wider region. The strength of domestic demand in South Africa has brought substantial
revenue windfalls to Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, and Swaziland, via the SACU revenuesharing arrangements. Any changes to these revenue-sharing arrangements, agreed among
the SACU partners, would need to take full account of the fiscal impact on the smaller
members. The expansion of trade and investment flows within the wider SADC would
contribute importantly to the region’s growth prospects.
60.
Addressing social disparities and the legacy of apartheid is important for the
ability of the government to sustain economic reforms. The authorities have enacted
codes of good practice for their Black Economic Empowerment initiative that clarify
implementation rules, reducing uncertainty for firms and investors. They are also reinforcing
the land reform program to speed up implementation, while keeping it based on well-defined
legal principles.
61.
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation will be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

Public and External Debt Sustainability
South Africa’s public debt position is sustainable. The ratio of government debt to GDP
has fallen from 48 percent in 1999 to 31½ percent at end-2006.16 Under the policies outlined
in the 2007 budget and the medium-term expenditure framework, public debt should
continue to decline to about 18 percent of GDP over the next five years. Gross financing
needs should also decline to below 2 percent of GDP per year in the medium-term,
significantly below the average of the past five years (Figure 1).
The declining trend in the public debt-to-GDP ratio can withstand a variety of shocks,
including weaker GDP growth, a lower primary balance, a 30 percent real depreciation of the
exchange rate, and a 10 percent increase in the debt stock (Figure 1). Under most of these
scenarios, the public debt ratio is only slightly above the baseline over the projection period,
and in the case of the “no policy change” scenario it even falls below. It remains higher in
the case of a hypothetical 10 percent debt shock, which is close to the total stock of
recognized contingent liabilities (9.8 percent of GDP by March 2006, including government
guarantees and actuarial liabilities for pension and insurance funds).
South Africa’s external debt is projected to decline gradually from its current level of
about 22½ percent of GDP to about 17¾ percent of GDP by 2012. The current account
deficit is projected to decline gradually over the medium-term to 4½ percent of GDP by
2012, as domestic demand growth moderates. The deficit is envisaged to be largely financed
by nondebt creating capital inflows, allowing for a gradual decline in the external debt-toGDP ratio.
The outlook for South Africa’s external debt and gross external financing needs is
robust to a broad range of shocks (Figure 2). With rand-denominated debt accounting for
about 37 percent of external debt at end-2006, currency risk is low; the share of short-term
debt in foreign-currency denominated debt (47 percent in December 2006) implies moderate
rollover risk. The results of various stress tests indicate that the largest adverse short-term
impact on the external debt would arise from a one-time 30 real depreciation of the rand,
which would bring the debt-to-GDP ratio to about 25 percent in 2008 before declining
gradually to about 12 percent of GDP by end-2012. The favorable debt profile reflects in part
the projected continued reliance on nondebt inflows to finance the current account deficit.
Permanent adverse shocks to real GDP growth, to real interest rates, or to the noninterest
current account, whether considered individually or together, would drive the debt-to-GDP
ratio to a maximum of about 24 percent by 2012.

Excluding local governments’ and SOE’s debt (1.3 and 6.6 percent of GDP at end 2006, respectively).

Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms, g = real GDP growth rate,
e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and rising
inflation (based on GDP deflator).

Permanent 1/4 standard deviation shocks applied to real interest rate, growth rate, and current account balance.
3
One-time real depreciation of 30 percent occurs in 2008.
4
The depreciation lowers nominal GDP measured in US dollars below the baseline, while non-debt creating flows
remain unchanged in U.S. dollar terms. As a result, they finance a larger portion of the current account, allowing
the debt ratio to decline faster than in the baseline.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:

The South African rand floats against other currencies. South Africa maintains an exchange
system free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international
transactions, except for measures implemented solely for the preservation of national or
international security which South Africa is in the process of notifying to the Fund pursuant
to the procedures set out in Decision No. 144-(52/51) (August 14, 1952). On June 15, 2007
the exchange rate of the rand was US$0.1391=R1.
With the abolition of the financial rand in 1995, all exchange controls on nonresidents were
eliminated. They are free to purchase shares, bonds, and other assets without restriction and
to repatriate dividends, interest receipts, and current and capital profits, as well as the original
investment capital. Foreign companies, governments and institutions may list on South
Africa’s bond and securities exchanges.

4
Since 1995, exchange controls on capital transaction by residents have also been relaxed.
Rather than allowing complete liberalization of a particular type of current or capital
transaction, the authorities have pursued a strategy of allowing an increasing array of
transactions, with each subject to a quantitative cap that has been progressively raised over
time. Regarding outward foreign direct investment by South African corporates, application
to the South African Reserve Bank’s Exchange Control Department is still required for
monitoring purposes and approval in terms of existing foreign direct investment criteria,
including demonstrated benefit to South Africa. The South African Reserve Bank reserves
the right to stagger capital outflows relating to large foreign investments so as to manage any
potential impact on the foreign exchange market.
Most of the remaining restrictions are on portfolio outflows. Institutional investors are
permitted to invest in foreign securities, subject to an overall limit of 15 percent of their total
retail assets for retirement funds and long-term insurers. Investment managers registered as
institutional investors for exchange control purposes and collective investment schemes
management companies are restricted to 25 percent of total retail assets under management.
Corporates may, upon application, be permitted to establish primary listings offshore under
certain conditions. Private individuals are allowed to invest up to R2,000,000 offshore. In
addition to the above, there are restrictions on, inter alia, the travel allowances (R160,000 for
private individuals), the transfer of funds abroad by emigrants (“blocked funds”), and the
investment of currency proceeds from exports (which must be repatriated within 180 days
from accrual). The transfer of blocked funds in excess of R2 million for individuals and
R4 million for families is allowed, provided a 10 percent exit levy is paid. Large amounts
may be staggered to manage any impact on the foreign exchange market. Dividends and
interest payments on the blocked funds are freely transferable abroad and travel allowances
can be augmented if bona fide need is documented.
VIII.

Article IV Consultations

The 2006 Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on August 2, 2006
(IMF Country Report No. 06/327 – September 2006). South Africa is on the standard
12-month Article IV consultation cycle.

Technical Assistance

A FAD mission took place in 2003 to discuss with the National Treasury their draft royalty
bill (published in March 2003). A monetary and financial statistics mission took place in
2003, followed up by a visit during May–June, 2004.
A STA mission, supported by a labor statistics consultant funded by the World Bank,
undertook a review of South Africa Labor Force Statistics in March 2005. The mission
recommended steps to produce statistics that are more reliable, better quality, and more
closely aligned with International Labor Organization (ILO) standards.

5
II. SOUTH AFRICA: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
Between 1990 and 1994, the Bank resumed activities in South Africa through economic
analysis and capacity building, resulting in papers and reports on the macroeconomy,
education, health, land reform, agriculture, fiscal decentralization, labor markets, trade
policy, and microfinance. During 1994–2004, the emphasis shifted towards policy advice and
dialogue on municipal and welfare services, macroeconomic strategy, poverty, job-creation,
medium-term expenditure framework, HIV/AIDS, and the business environment. Lending
has been limited to the Industrial Competitiveness and Job Creation Project (approved for
US$46 million and subsequently reduced to US$24.5 million at the government’s request),
which closed in September 2004; and a Technical Assistance Loan for the Municipal
Financial Management Technical Assistance Project (MFMTAP), approved in 2002 for an
amount of US$15 million. There is a large GEF-funded program for nature conservation and
development: the C.A.P.E. Biodiversity Conservation and Sustainable Development Project
(US$9 million); the Cape Peninsula Biodiversity Conservation Project (US$12.3 million); the
Maloti-Drakensberg Transfrontier Conservation and Development Project (US$7.9 million);
and the Greater Addo Elephant National Park Project (US$5.5 million).
Most recently, the emphasis in the policy dialogue and knowledge work has been on urban
and rural development (urban and municipal development, land reform and agriculture,
private sector development and the environment) and regional integration. Across sectors,
capacity-building for public service delivery, also supported by a stepped-up in-country
presence of the World Bank Institute, is the main theme. The Bank and South Africa are in
the final phase of agreeing on a joint Country Partnership Strategy for 2007–11.
The International Finance Corporation’s (IFC) committed portfolio has grown steadily from
US$114 million in 2000 to $342 million in South Africa as of May 2007, the second largest
in Africa after Nigeria. The IFC’s strategy is to (i) support South African companies going
north and going global; (ii) provide advice and financing within South Africa where there are
underserved niches in the local market and where IFC can bring value added that
complements local capabilities; and (iii) offer advisory services and related support for
smaller business, with a focus on the informal sector and education
South Africa has been a member of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA)
since 1994. As an investor country, South Africa is the most active user of MIGA guarantees
among the category two countries and, and its investors account for US$251.8 million of the
Agency’s gross exposure. The current portfolio of investments sponsored by these investors
is diverse, consisting of projects in the agribusiness, infrastructure, manufacturing and oil and
gas sectors in such countries as Cameroon, Kenya, Mozambique, Syria, and Swaziland. As a
host country, South Africa accounts for US$12.3 million of MIGA gross portfolio. This
project, financed by Swiss investors, is in support of the country’s financial sector.

6
III. SOUTH AFRICA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Economic and financial data provided to the Fund are adequate for surveillance purposes.
South Africa subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) on August 2,
1996 and met the SDDS specifications for the coverage, periodicity, and timeliness of data,
and for dissemination of advance release calendars on September 18, 2000. A Report on
Observance of Standards and Codes—Data Module, Response by the Authorities, and
Detailed Assessments Using the Data Quality Assessment Framework (DQAF) were
published October 16, 2001 and are available through the IMF’s external website.
Real sector
In November 2004, the base year of the national accounts was changed from 1995 to 2000. At
the same time, benchmarking was undertaken to reflect more accurately the structure of the
economy, incorporate new areas of the economy previously not covered or under-covered,
and to introduce other methodological changes to the compilation of data. These changes
resulted in an upward revision of the average annual growth rate of real GDP for the period
1998 to 2003 from 2.4 percent to 2.7 percent. South Africa’s national accounts are compiled
according to the SNA 1993.
Reporting of real sector data for International Financial Statistics (IFS) is timely.
Data reported for Direction of Trade Statistics (DOTS), however, differ substantially with
external trade data reported for IFS, particularly exports, due to balance of payments
adjustments.
Labor market statistics are published with lags of three months, and unemployment data are
available only at a six month frequency. Given the seriousness of the unemployment problem,
labor market analysis and policy design would benefit from better, more frequent and timely
labor market data. A revision of the Labor Force Survey is underway and will be released
quarterly starting late 2008.
The consumer price index (CPI) covers all households living in metropolitan and urban areas,
which represent approximately 56 percent of the total number of households and 75 percent
of private consumption expenditures. The CPI weights are based on an Income and
Expenditure of Households Survey conducted from November 1999 to October 2000.
Beginning with the April 2003 index, Statistics South Africa issued revisions to the Consumer
Price Index for the period January 2002 to March 2003, reflecting the incorporation of more
reliable data on residential rents. After finalizing the ongoing analysis of the 2005 Income and
Expenditure Survey, Statistics South Africa plans to update the weights in the CPI basket.

7
Government finance
South Africa currently reports data for the consolidated general government for publication in
the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook. It also reports monthly data covering the cash
operations of the budgetary central government for publication in IFS. Data are compiled and
disseminated according to the GFSM 2001 framework. Data for social security funds and
central government’s extra budgetary funds have been reported on an accrual basis, starting in
2000 and 2002, respectively. Starting in 2005, the authorities have included additional
noncash data, consistent with their migration to accrual accounting.
Monetary statistics
South Africa regularly reports good quality monetary statistics for publication in the IFS and
the IFS Supplement, although there is room for improving the timeliness of the data on
depository financial institutions. The SARB is working on the implementation of the
recommendations of the 2003 and 2004 missions towards full implementation of the
methodology recommended in the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual.
Balance of payments
Balance of payments data are broadly consistent with the fifth edition of the Balance of
Payments Manual (BPM5). There are plans to publish more detailed information on “other
services” in the future. The authorities are also working with their partners in the Southern
African Customs Union (SACU) to improve the coverage of intra-SACU trade flows.
Net errors and omissions in the balance of payments are large, averaging 2.1 percent of GDP
during 2003–06. Work is ongoing to improve the reliability and accuracy of balance of
payments data.
The banking sector holdings of foreign-currency assets have been removed from the official
measure of reserves, in accordance with international practice in this area. Data on
international reserve position are disseminated in line with the requirements of the IMF’s
template on international reserves and foreign currency liquidity.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
July 25, 2007

1.
This statement provides information that has become available since the staff report
was prepared. The thrust of the staff appraisal remains unchanged.
2.
Recent indicators, such as manufacturing output and the purchasing managers' index,
suggest that economic activity has remained robust, while showing some signs of
moderation. Moreover, employment in the formal non-agricultural business sector rose
slightly during the first quarter of 2007 and, as of March, was up by 2¼ percent compared to
June 2006, the earliest data point available according to a revised methodology. Inflation rose
to 6.4 percent (CPIX, year-on-year) in May, mainly reflecting higher food and fuel prices.
The rand has lately strengthened somewhat against major currencies.
3.
Market confidence remains high, as South Africa’s sovereign spreads remain low and
stock prices are hovering around historic heights. By mid-July, net nonresident purchases of
stocks and bonds have reached about 3 percent of GDP.
4.
In a well-publicized event, the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) made its core
forecasting model public in June. Staff welcomes this additional step in shedding light on an
important component of the Bank’s already quite transparent inflation targeting framework.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
August 6, 2007

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes Article IV Consultation with South
Africa
On July 25, 2007 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with South Africa.1
Background
Real GDP grew by 5 percent in 2006 and continued to grow vigorously in early 2007.
Growth was driven by strong domestic demand, with private consumption and
investment spending supported by continuing robust consumer and business sentiment
and low interest rates until late 2006. Household consumption was also boosted by
growing disposable income and wealth effects from rising asset prices. Real GDP grew
by 4.7 percent in the first quarter of 2007, indicating that conditions for business
remained favorable.
The strong pace of economic activity led to higher employment. Total employment grew
by 4.1 percent in the year to September 2006. However, the unemployment rate
declined only moderately to 25.5 percent, as labor force participation rose.
Inflation pressures have intensified recently. After a prolonged period of remaining within
the 3–6 percent target band, twelve-month CPIX inflation2 came at 6.3 percent in
April 2007, reflecting both rising food and fuel prices and demand pressures. Inflation
expectations for the year ahead, as reflected in inflation-indexed bond prices, point to a
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return
to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive
Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board,
summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's
authorities.

2
reading above 6 percent, broadly in line with the South African Reserve Bank’s (SARB)
updated outlook. In response to the deteriorating inflation outlook, the SARB raised its
policy interest rate from 9 to 9½ percent in June.
Credit to the private sector has remained buoyant despite recent interest rate hikes,
expanding by 25.1 percent in the year ending in April 2007. Household debt rose
markedly (to 76 percent of disposable income by the first quarter of 2007, from
69.4 percent a year earlier). Pushed in part by rising interest rates, household debt
service has risen to about 9½ percent of disposable income, but remains below historic
highs.
The SARB has maintained a flexible exchange rate system, while continuing to build up
international reserves. The SARB has a publicly-announced policy of intervening in the
foreign exchange market only to bolster its reserve position. Consistent with this policy,
gross reserves have continued to grow, and by May 2007 reached US$27.9 billion,
equivalent to over 200 percent of short term external debt. After depreciating markedly
in mid-2006, the rand has fluctuated without a clear trend.
The current account deficit expanded to 6½ percent of GDP in 2006 and 7 percent in the
first quarter of 2007, largely driven by strong domestic demand. The widening of the
current account reflected primarily faster volume growth in imports than exports. The
deficit was more than covered by large portfolio inflows, mainly equity. External debt
nevertheless rose marginally to 22.4 percent of GDP by end-2006.
The fiscal balance of the national government turned into a surplus of 0.6 percent of
GDP in FY2006/07, bringing government debt down to about 31 percent of GDP. The
surplus, the first in several decades, reflected a large increase in tax revenue, owing to
strong economic activity and continued enforcement efforts.
Asset prices continued to rise rapidly in 2006 and early 2007. Strong commodity prices,
favorable growth prospects, and positive assessments by rating agencies drove the
Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) all-share index up by 38 percent in 2006 and a
further 15 percent through May 2007. Residential property prices continued their steady
rise, growing by 15½ percent in the year ending in May 2007.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors noted that South Africa has started to reap the benefits of sustained sound
macroeconomic management and structural reforms, recently supported by favorable
external conditions. The economy has experienced vigorous growth and rising
employment accompanied by rapid credit expansion, booming asset prices,
strengthening public finances, and rising international reserves. At the same time,
however, the external current account deficit has widened markedly, and inflation
pressures have recently intensified. Directors also noted that South Africa continues to
face high unemployment and poverty, and welcomed the government’s efforts to tackle
these problems while pursuing policies aimed at maintaining macroeconomic stability.
Directors considered that the economic outlook for South Africa remains broadly
positive. Going forward, a range of indicators point to continuing robust growth. Inflation

3
is expected to remain above the upper edge of the target band in the near term,
however, and continuing strength of domestic demand would keep the current account
deficit at relatively high levels.
Directors saw the main risks to the outlook coming from the global environment and the
strong pace of domestic demand. On the external front, the economy could be adversely
affected by weaker appetite for emerging market assets, a global slowdown, or a sharp
deterioration in the terms of trade. Directors noted that the widening current account
deficit and high reliance on portfolio inflows have raised vulnerability to external shocks.
However, they believed that the country’s strong fundamentals should limit the adverse
impact of these shocks on the economy. On the domestic front, Directors considered
that a continuation of rapid growth in domestic demand, in combination with capacity
constraints, could lead to further widening of the current account deficit and intensifying
price pressures.
Directors welcomed the additional monetary policy tightening in June, noting that risks to
the inflation outlook remained on the upside. They considered that interest rates may
need to be raised further, to anchor inflation expectations well within the target inflation
band. Directors supported the authorities’ commitment to the flexible exchange rate
regime, as this is an integral part of the inflation targeting framework and provides a
cushion against external shocks, thus helping to promote external stability. They noted
that there was little conclusive evidence of any significant exchange rate misalignment.
Directors encouraged the authorities to continue to relax exchange controls gradually, in
order to allow for better allocation of resources and ultimately reduce exchange rate
volatility through a deepening of the market.
Directors commended the authorities for their continuing sound fiscal policies. They
noted that the budget balance has turned into a surplus for the first time in several
decades and public debt has been declining steadily. Moreover, expenditures are
appropriately focused on upgrading infrastructure and relieving pressing social needs.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to maintain a broadly neutral fiscal stance
in the current fiscal year, and most Directors considered that keeping such a stance until
the external current account deficit starts declining may be warranted.
Directors noted the strength and resilience of the financial system, and encouraged the
authorities to continue enhancing regulation and oversight, especially in the context of
the current buoyant credit environment and the recent increase in household
indebtedness. They commended the authorities’ efforts to improve access to basic
financial services, especially outside of urban areas. Directors also welcomed the
authorities’ interest in an update of the Financial Sector Assessment Program for South
Africa in 2008.
Directors supported the government’s goals of raising growth and reducing
unemployment under the Accelerated and Shared Growth Initiative for South Africa.
Potential growth seems to have increased in recent years, and could increase even
further with the envisaged strong capital accumulation and productivity-enhancing
structural reforms. In that regard, Directors considered that efforts to boost growth and
employment could be complemented by further initiatives to improve the functioning of

4
labor markets and liberalize the trade regime, and cautioned against the possible
distortions that might arise from industrial policy interventions.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case

Statement by Peter Gakunu, Executive Director for South Africa
and Goolam Aboobaker, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
July 25, 2007
1.
The South African authorities would like to thank the Staff for a constructive report
and an issues paper rich in information. The authorities would also like to indicate that they
appreciate the frank engagement on the challenges confronting the country.
2.
Prudent macro-economic policies over the past decade have resulted in impressive
economic growth that is helping the country to make a serious impact on reducing
unemployment and poverty. Poverty eradication and employment creation remain serious
challenges going forward. Buoyant growth in South Africa has also been good for the
Southern African Development Community (SADC) region as a whole and has greatly
benefited members of the South African Customs Union (SACU).
Recent Economic Developments
3.
The last three years in particular have seen the economy growing at an average rate of
5% but has slowed down marginally because of the general decline in mining. The higher
rate has begun to impact on employment, which has grown in the past year by over 4%,
although the numbers of unemployed continue to be unacceptably high.
4.
The current account deficit widened to 6.5 percent in 2006 and increased to 7.0
percent of GDP in the first quarter of 2007 and continues to be funded via capital inflows
into portfolio investments on the Johannesburg Securities Exchange (JSE). However the
authorities believe that this deficit reflects rising investment rather than a growing fiscal
imbalance. While they are concerned that such an unusually high deficit level exposes a
country to a sudden stop in capital inflows, they consider that the relatively low external
liabilities and the fact that fiscal policy is aimed at increasing the level of government
savings should mitigate the risks posed by the current account deficit.
5.
Further, the authorities share the view of Staff that sound macro-economic
fundamentals, particularly the low external debt together with a well managed and stable
financial sector and a flexible exchange rate regime would assist in mitigating this risk.
Monetary Policy Developments
6.
The key development regarding monetary policy was the breach of the 6% inflation
target, the first since the introduction of the inflation targeting framework in 2003. The
Monetary authorities are conscious of the fact that there is an upside risk to inflation and that
it has acted promptly recently when inflation, fuelled largely by buoyant oil and food prices,
rose to 6.3 per cent in the past quarter with a 50 basis points interest rate hike; and is ready
to tighten policy further if necessary.

2
7.
The South African Reserve Bank (SARB) has continued with its policy of gradual
reserve accumulation, and is committed to increasing reserves in line with other emerging
market economies. At end June 2007, gross reserves stood at $28.3 billions and net reserves
at $25.9 billions. The authorities see that there is room for sterilized reserves purchases to
improve external vulnerability and mop up excess capital inflows.
8.
The flexible exchange rate system had served the authorities well and as recognized
by staff is not misaligned. However, it is difficult to estimate an equilibrium value for the
rand. The volatility of the exchange rate has been reduced significantly and the accumulation
of reserves has reduced exchange rate risk. Remaining exchange controls, including capital
outflows by residents and portfolio investments, continue to be relaxed, while the National
Treasury is also assessing the approaches of other countries to benefit from best practice.
Fiscal Policy
9.
Public finances remain healthy as robust economic performance and improved
revenue administration have led to increase in revenues. This, together with reduction in debt
service costs has enabled the announcement of a budget surplus in the current financial year
as well as a balanced budget over the Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) cycle
despite projecting a significant increase in spending over the period.
10.
The strong fiscal position has allowed the authorities to allocate substantial resources
to social and economic programmes over the three year cycle. The public sector would
continue to maintain an upward trend in investments in gross fixed capital formation as part
of the ASGISA initiative, with the objective of modernizing crucial economic and social
infrastructure and improving basic household infrastructure.
11.
A central plank of government programme continues to be the eradication of poverty
and the reduction of inequality and, in the light of both stronger economic performance and
the greater fiscal space, the authorities have decided to embark on further reforms of the
social security system. The reforms have several objectives, including lowering the costs of
job creation, extending basic social security benefits to a larger number of workers and their
families, and building on existing government-funded social assistance and social security
programmes. Before finalization and launching of the proposed reforms, the authorities
intend to enter into substantive discussions with principal stakeholders including organized
businesses and trade unions.
12.
With over 5.5 million people living with HIV (18.8 per cent of adult population, with
women between the ages of 25-29 years worst affected), combating HIV/AIDS continues to
be one of the major challenges confronting the authorities. Building on the Comprehensive
Plan and earlier initiatives, the authorities launched a revised strategic plan in May 2007 with
a budget of over R14 billion over the MTEF cycle. The plan has four main elements:
prevention programmes; treatment, care and support of patients; monitoring, research and

3
surveillance; and Human and legal Rights. Currently, there are over 282,000 patients enrolled
for public sector anti-retro viral treatment and over 300 facilities accredited to implement the
comprehensive strategy.
Financial Sector
13.
South Africa is served by a well run and managed financial system that is highly
concentrated and profitable, but dominated by a few large banks and insurance companies.
The system is also well regulated, with strong oversight shared between the Central Bank and
the Ministry of Finance. The SARB undertakes regular reviews of the financial system using
stress tests, analysis of corporate balance sheets and debt burdens. The results of the review
are published twice a year.
14.
The authorities acknowledge that the rapid credit expansion, particularly household
debt, posed certain risks and highlighted the need for further enhancements to the regulatory
and monitoring framework. They have therefore promptly effected the National Credit Act to
provide some protection to consumers and simultaneously slow down the rate of credit
extension. Consequently, non-performing loans had declined while household debt had
started to decelerate. However, debt service costs remain at historic lows.
Structural Reforms for Accelerating Economic Growth and Competitiveness
15.
Achieving higher and shared growth (ASGISA) is based on unlocking the six binding
constraints which have been identified, namely, volatility of exchange rate; inadequate
infrastructure and logistics; skills shortages; barriers to entry and competition; regulatory
burdens on SMEs; and capacity limitations within the state. Significant progress has been
made in addressing these constraints in the context of implementing the ASGISA initiative.
Some of the policy responses also include undertaking a comparative study of the experience
of some inflation targeting countries in interventions in foreign exchange markets;
implementing dedicated projects at the DBSA and in the office of the Deputy President under
the JIPSA, aimed at improving the capacity of sub-national governments for infrastructure
development; identifying and acquiring priority skills both internally and externally;
evaluating the skills development and public works programme to assess their effectiveness;
and addressing competitiveness concerns in the economy through measures to increase
productivity and reduce the cost of doing business.
16.
Significant progress has also been achieved in the implementation of other key
elements of the ASGISA initiative. The number of capital projects behind schedule has
decreased; the programme to increase the numbers of artisans supported by businesses and
trade union leaders is beginning to bear fruits; and, in close consultation with higher
education authorities, a programme to produce an additional 1000 engineers has been
launched.

17.
For promoting industrial sectors, the ASGISA initiative places a sharper focus on
tourism with an emphasis on an airlift programme, increasing safety and security of tourists
and support for SMEs; on bio-fuels - concentrating on maize and sugar cane as fuel source
with a target of 4.5 per cent of oil requirements to be met by bio-fuels by 2013; and on
business process operations and outsourcing - reducing the cost of telecommunications and
skills development.
18.
Furthermore, the South African government takes quite seriously the practice of
monitoring and evaluation, both through the ten year review exercise and by insisting that
Ministers report on the implementation of government’s programme of actions on a bimonthly basis.
Regional Development
19.
South Africa, with 6% of the population accounting for over a third (on a PPP basis)
of SSA GDP has made significant impact on the African economy. Trade linkages with the
rest of the continent, though starting from a small base, has begun to see significant
increases. South African direct investments in other parts of Africa have started to take off,
doubling since 2000 and standing at about $3.7 billion in 2004. There has been a marked
increase in the number of South African companies operating on the continent. Sixty of the
top 100 companies listed on the JSE have direct ownership of foreign affiliates in Africa,
while another 26 are holding companies that have investments in Africa; South African
banks operate in 17 countries.
20.
South Africa belongs to a Common Monetary Area (CMA) that includes Lesotho,
Swaziland and Namibia, the SA Customs Union (CMA plus Botswana) and the Southern
African Development Community. It accounts for over two thirds of the combined SADC
GDP and for about 60 % of intra-SADC trade. The determined economic growth has had
significant spillover effects, particularly to the SACU members with a significant increase in
revenue receipts by the BLNS countries. The authorities are in favor of stronger regional
integration and the broadening of the Customs Union. The country also attracts a large
number of migrants from neighboring countries as well as from afar. These developments
reflect both the demand-pull effects of South Africa’s strong growth and skill shortages, as
well as the supply-push effects of economic turmoil in some countries.
21.
The authorities are discussing with SACU members regarding the revenue sharing
formula and they have given assurance that they would not make any uni-lateral changes to
SACU or to its revenue sharing formula.
