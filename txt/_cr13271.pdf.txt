STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
July 3, 2013

KEY ISSUES
Context: The significant buildup of public debt in the aftermath of the collapse of the
lending boom in 2008 remains a significant vulnerability. The post-bubble debt overhang in
the private sector has been a drag on the economic recovery and could prolong the period
of sub-par growth going forward.
Fiscal Policy: The immediate challenge is to reverse the trajectory of rising public debt.
Economic activity remains sluggish, but vulnerabilities related to debt—including rollover
needs—make it difficult to moderate the pace of fiscal adjustment. A sustained, multi-year
fiscal consolidation effort is needed to reduce the public debt burden to an appropriately
low level over the longer term.
Financial Sector: The painful downsizing of the banking system is advanced, but limited
progress on NPL resolution means private sector balance sheets remain impaired; this
contributes to a negative feedback loop whereby sluggish private sector demand is
contributing to weak economic activity and a further deterioration of asset quality. Structural
impediments that hinder the cleanup of private sector balance sheets need to be removed.
Structural Reform: Energy and tourism have potential to be important drivers of growth,
but improvements in the business climate and reduction in infrastructure bottlenecks are
essential for these sectors to attract foreign investment. Strengthening property rights,
improving contract enforcement, and improving the quality of regulations at the municipal
level would also help in boosting investment and medium-term growth.

MONTENEGRO

CONTEXT: ELEVATED PUBLIC AND PRIVATE DEBT
1.
Montenegro is still struggling with the buildup of debt in the aftermath of the collapse
of the lending boom five years ago. Pro-cyclical fiscal policy at the height of the lending boom
resulted in large structural deficits that have proven difficult to unwind, yielding a sharp increase in
public debt since 2008. There has also been little progress in addressing the private sector debt
overhang related to the large stock of bad loans. NPLs remain elevated, and progress in
restructuring or recovery of these assets has been limited, keeping the private sector highly
indebted and with limited access to financing. This has constrained investment, dampened growth
prospects, and left the country entirely dependent on external drivers of growth.
2.
The authorities have a mixed record of implementing recent policy advice in Article IV
consultations. They have embarked on a more serious fiscal consolidation effort in 2012 and 2013
than in the past—a key recommendation in earlier consultations—and their approach toward
downsizing and strengthening the financial sector has generally been in line with Fund advice.
However, the government continues to find it difficult to develop consensus on addressing the
Yugoslav social and subsidy spending legacy, and in dealing with the troubled aluminum producer
(KAP).
3.
EU accession appears on track. Montenegro received official candidate status for EU
accession in December 2010, and began accession negotiations in June 2012. Two of the
35 chapters of the EU acquis have been closed and the process is expected to take at least
6–7 years.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
4.
Domestic factors drove output to below potential in 2012. Tourism and FDI held up
relatively well despite the uncertainties in the euro area, and have been the key drivers of economic
activity. But unusually severe winter weather constrained output early in the year, while aluminum
production fell sharply in the

18 percent of GDP, though a sizable part comprised imports associated with FDI in the tradable
sector.1
5.
Activity has picked up in early 2013, reflecting good weather conditions. Electricity
production rose sharply driven by favorable rainfall, rising 75 percent (year on year) in January–April.
The metal sector remained a drag on activity, however, with output contracting by 50 percent (year
on year) over the same period, as KAP continued to produce at below 50 percent of capacity. The
recovery in retail trade has been relatively modest despite the removal of weather-related
bottlenecks so far this year.
6.
Public debt continued to rise in 2012 despite a sizable fiscal adjustment effort. There
was a nearly 1 percent of GDP improvement in the fiscal deficit in 2012 (2 percent in cyclically
adjusted terms), though this primarily reflected cuts in capital spending and transfers. Still, this was
insufficient to curb spending as much as planned, and the deficit outturn was 4.3 percent of GDP,
well above the revised budget

authorities have introduced a

number of measures to underpin
this adjustment—including a freeze on pensions and public sector wage adjustment, and an
increase in the personal income tax rate for workers with high salaries. In addition, the recently
approved increase in the standard VAT rate from 17 to 19 percent would yield 0.5-0.6 percent of
GDP in 2013. In addition, repayment of the remaining loan guarantees to KAP is still under
negotiation but now appears unlikely to begin until 2014; this would create additional fiscal space of
0.8 percent of GDP relative to 2012.

8.
The banking system has been undergoing a massive balance sheet adjustment. Large
deposit outflows immediately following the collapse of the credit bubble in 2008 necessitated a
significant downsizing of banks’ balance sheets to re-align lending with a more sustainable funding
base. Even though parent banks provided support in the immediate aftermath of the crisis, domestic
subsidiaries have had to repay these lines in the subsequent period, by scaling back lending and

aggressively competing for domestic deposits. The resulting balance sheet adjustment at the local
bank level is now at an advanced stage, and banks are reaching a position where they have excess
liquidity relative to lending opportunities in the domestic market.
9.
Bank credit shrank for the fourth consecutive year, despite a modest recovery in
deposits. The level of credit outstanding fell by 4 percent in 2012, bringing the cumulative
post-2008 decline to about one third (Figure 2). Banks continued to repay their foreign obligations;
foreign liabilities now account for less than a quarter of total bank assets, for the first time since
mid-2007. This, together with a gradual recovery in deposits, has helped lower the system’s
loan-deposit ratio to below 100 percent (from near 160 in early 2009).
10.
Banks continue to struggle with rising NPLs, while private sector balance sheet
cleanup remains unfinished. Banks have

capital adequacy ratio is at 14.7 percent.

11.
The aluminum processing plant (KAP) has been downsized, but fiscal costs and risks
remain. KAP’s workforce has been more than halved in recent years to 1,200 employees, and its
share of overall domestic output has dropped from nearly 7 percent in 2005 to less than 2 in 2012.
But it has continued to require significant fiscal support in the form of direct subsidies of about
1percent of GDP annually in 2010–12, and has accumulated electricity bill arrears—likely to be a
fiscal liability—of about 2 percent of GDP. The government also provided loan guarantees to KAP in
2009 amounting to an additional 5 percent of GDP. The authorities have been seeking to take over
the company (originally privatized in 2005) and sell it to a new investor, but have so far been unable
to either reach agreement with the current owner or find a new investor. In addition to KAP’s poor
financial performance, high indebtedness (11½ percent of GDP) and overstaffing, its attractiveness is
also hampered by significant investment needs. Since the completion of mission’s discussions, the
authorities have launched bankruptcy proceedings for the company in the local commercial court.
12.
Montenegro compares favorably to regional peers on business climate, but several key
deficiencies remain. The country ranks 51st out of 185 countries in the World Bank’s Doing Business,
but scores poorly on registering property and dealing with construction permits, where delays have
been increasing, especially at the municipal level. An inefficient judicial system, together with unclear
and ad hoc rules and regulations, also pose obstacles for investors. The authorities have heightened
6

MONTENEGRO

efforts recently to reduce the grey economy, by strengthened monitoring and increasing fines for
noncompliance.
13.
The labor market continues to underperform. A multi-tiered wage setting process hinders
adjustment of wages to economic conditions. Limits on the duration of fixed term contracts, in favor
of more permanent ones, deter job creation. The unemployment rate has been largely stagnant,
close to 20 percent in recent years, with 70 percent of unemployment being long term. Participation
remains below 50 percent, partly reflecting early retirements taken by workers in downsized
Yugoslav-era enterprises. At the same time, the heavy presence of foreign workers, particularly in
tourism, suggests an unwillingness of locals to consider certain jobs. The high unemployment rate at
younger age levels also points to a possible supply-demand mismatch of skills in growth sectors.

REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
A. Outlook and Risks
14.
There was agreement that favorable weather conditions would support an economic
rebound this year. Staff projects real GDP growth of 1½ percent, with relatively balanced risks to
the baseline. Good rainfall has boosted electricity production and exports, while there are
indications that construction of several new resorts could begin in the fourth quarter, after repeated
delays recently. These projects should also provide some support for growth over the medium term,
but tourism growth is likely to be modest in the near term because of the weak external
environment and emerging capacity constraints, especially at high-end accommodations. In
addition, credit is expected to remain stagnant because of impaired private sector balance sheets
and risk aversion, while retrenchment in metal output will continue to be a drag on activity.
15.
The authorities see upside potential relative to this projection. They highlighted the
negative impact of last year’s severe winter and expect a strong bounce back in the first quarter,
relative to last year’s low base. They also believe there is scope for stronger growth in tourism, and
cited the potential redirection of Croatia-bound Russian tourists to Montenegro because of new
EU-related visa requirements in the former.
16.
Staff and authorities agreed that medium-term growth prospects depended on
attracting FDI to develop Montenegro’s significant potential. The authorities were optimistic
that several large projects were moving into implementation phase. Staff was more cautious on
medium-term prospects under the baseline, and emphasized the need to address the business
climate issues that have hindered these projects from moving forward. Nevertheless, there was
broad agreement that given the very small size of the economy, one or two new investment projects
could change the outlook significantly.

Staff sees risks to the outlook as tilted to the downside. The rising debt level and recent
jump in global risk aversion increase the cost of financing and exacerbate both near and medium

term external financing risks (Appendix I).3 A reemergence of financial stress in the euro area could
significantly worsen the outlook for the financial sector, growth and debt sustainability. Over the
medium term, a protracted period of slower European growth could affect growth prospects
(relative to the baseline scenario; Figure 5). On the other hand, tourism receipts and/or
implementation of large foreign investment projects could surprise on the upside; given the small
size of the economy, one or two major projects could have a significant impact.

B. Fiscal Policy
18.
The run-up in public debt in the last four years represents a significant risk.
Montenegro’s euroization, thin government deposit cover and shallow domestic financial market
leave the country almost entirely reliant on external financing, and vulnerable to shifts in market
conditions, especially given a sharp jump in rollover needs in 2015–2016. The key challenge
therefore is to reverse the trajectory of

maintenance costs, while public wages and

widened the pension financing gap to 5 percent of GDP in 2012, from 1.2 percent in 2008, while the
public wage bill remains high, relative both to regional comparators and other small states. The

squeeze of capital spending—about 6½ percent of GDP since 2008—has undermined the country’s
long-term growth potential. To overcome these challenges, the authorities are developing a fiscal
rule that would constrain current spending to tax revenues, cap public debt at 60 percent of GDP,
and limit annual fiscal deficits at 3 percent of GDP.
20.
The authorities are considering a major highway project to enhance domestic and
international economic integration. The highway would connect Montenegro to its relatively less
developed northern areas and Serbia, but the difficult mountainous terrain means construction costs
could be as much as 25 percent of GDP. Various modes of financing appear to be available,
including one based entirely on debt.

Staff advice
21.
The public debt burden should be reduced to an appropriately low level over the long
term through sustained multi-year fiscal consolidation. The lack of an exchange rate instrument
and the country’s vulnerability to external shocks put extra burden on fiscal policy, and argue for a
larger buffer than would be suggested for a typical emerging market economy. Staff advised the
adoption of a public debt target of 30 percent of GDP by 2023 with an intermediate target of
45 percent of GDP by 2018, as indicated in earlier announcements by the authorities and one that
would eventually return public debt to the 2008 level. Given the difficulties in implementing
adjustment targets till this year, and the record of lack of specificity in medium term plans, staff
suggested specifying a fiscal adjustment path that would underpin the target, with supporting
revenue and expenditure measures. To ensure the fiscal rule is durable, operationally effective in
improving fiscal discipline, and consistent with medium term policy objectives, staff advised the
authorities to follow simple and permanent fiscal principles, and embed the rule in a well developed
medium term framework with a public debt target (recommendations of FAD technical assistance.

The fiscal consolidation measures adopted this year are welcome, and should be
extended to 2014 and beyond. These measures, combined with an expected one year delay in the
repayment of KAP-related guarantees, should yield a fiscal deficit reduction of 2 percent of GDP,
and thus allow the authorities to meet their 2013 deficit target and help slow the pace of public
debt accumulation. But more needs to be done in future years to put public debt on a declining

trend, and additional savings will be required next year to offset expected outlays to repay the
KAP-related guarantees. Staff suggested an even adjustment path in 2014–16—a further structural
adjustment of ¾ percent of GDP per year, implying an overall deficit target of 2 percent of GDP for
2014 (see alternative scenario). The adjustment is recommended to focus on public wages and
pensions.4 Staff also advised the authorities to utilize any opportunities that may arise in the near
and medium term to gradually build up a fiscal reserve to cushion against shocks.
23.
High public indebtedness and rollover risks limit the scope for debt financing for the
highway project. While such infrastructure investments could improve Montenegro’s long-term
growth potential, and facilitate the economic integration of its less developed regions, the relatively
back-loaded payoff from the project, and the need to maintain financial market access for budget
finance and high rollover requirement argue against loan financing. Staff emphasized the benefits of
exploring alternative financing arrangements, but cautioned that implicit government commitments
in such vehicles would need to be assessed carefully.

Authorities’ views
24.
The public debt target should be pursued flexibly while conforming to a fiscal rule. The
authorities agreed that 30 percent of GDP was a reasonable longer-term debt target, but argued for
flexibility in implementation over the near term, to provide scope for the infrastructure investment
currently under consideration. They argued that the boost to long term growth potential from the
prospective highway project would justify the risks emanating from debt financing for the project.
25.
The temporary measures introduced this year may be renewed, but further savings
would have to come from structural reforms. The authorities agreed on the need to revisit the
pension reforms implemented in 2010 to ensure financial viability of the fund. However, they also
emphasized the importance of ensuring adequate benefits for such a vulnerable segment of the
population. They saw the ongoing reform of public administration and stepped-up efforts to
strengthen tax compliance in the informal economy as beginning to deliver savings over the next
several years.
26.
Refinancing could mitigate rollover risk. While acknowledging the risks posed by the
spike in rollover requirements beginning in 2015, the authorities are keen to refinance some of their
earlier issuance to smooth the repayment profile.

4

The high import propensity and the small and open nature of the Montenegrin economy would likely result in a
muted impact of the proposed fiscal adjustment on growth. Studies estimate multipliers of 0.5 or less for such
countries, with investment spending having the largest impact and a smaller effect of revenue measures, transfers
and current spending. However, the impact could be somewhat higher at a time when output is below potential,
access to credit is constrained and, there is no monetary policy offset.

MONTENEGRO

C. Financial Sector Policies
27.
Banks continue to struggle with rising NPLs which in turn are impacting profitability
and capitalization. In a bid to clean up balance sheets banks have aggressively sold off problem
loans to factoring companies, but a considerable stock of NPLs remains on their books. Loan-loss
provisions were 40 percent of NPLs at end 2012, with NPLs net of provisions amounting to
68 percent of capital, putting a strain on banks’ profitability and capitalization. With the banking
system largely foreign-owned, and with some parent banks facing problems, the capacity of parents
to support their Montenegrin subsidiaries remains a concern.
28.
While banks’ balance sheet adjustment is at an advanced stage, credit growth will
hinge on private sector restructuring. Limited progress on the restructuring and resolution of
NPLs means that corporate balance sheets remain burdened with very high debt (Appendix III). As a
result, supply as well as demand for credit remain weak pending resolution of the bad loans.
Negative feedback loops may further impact bank risk aversion and credit growth. Staff analysis
suggests that while demand factors, emanating from a weak economy, are increasingly pronounced
in explaining credit performance, supply constraints are binding determinants of credit (see Box 1).
High NPLs and large nonfinancial sector debt run the risk of amplifying the impact of adverse
financial shocks on financial stability and the economy.

Staff advice
29.
Structural distortions that hinder the cleanup of bank and private sector balance
sheets should be removed. There is a need to accelerate collateral execution which is constrained
by ad hoc application of the law and lengthy court procedures. Efforts should also focus on ensuring
that independent appraisals more accurately reflect current market conditions, strengthening the
land registry, and improving the quality of accounting and auditing standards.5 The implementation
of the ongoing World Bank project to facilitate out-of-court settlement and remove regulatory and
legal obstacles should also be accelerated.
30.
The high level of NPLs, weak profitability, and uncertain prospects for parent support
call for stepped up supervision. The authorities should continue to strictly monitor NPLs, enforce
adequate provisioning, and undertake regular stress tests in order to assess the need for additional
capitalization. In this regard, they should ensure that banks proactively seek additional capital and
respond promptly to any shortfalls. The authorities should also continue to strengthen their
contingency planning framework and implementation plans in line with recent MCM technical
assistance recommendations. The regulatory and supervisory umbrella should be appropriately
extended to factoring companies to minimize regulatory arbitrage.

5

As appraisals may not always reflect prevailing market conditions, factoring companies often end up buying
repossessed properties at artificially high prices, which can further delay recovery, and balance sheet clean up.

Box 1. Supply Constraint on Credit in Montenegro1
Results from the estimation of a disequilibrium credit demand-supply model confirm the binding role
of supply constraints in the period following the 2008 crisis. Prior to the crisis, high credit growth was
fueled by increases in both credit demand and supply, with large excess demand that dissipated quickly
after the crisis broke. The period 2009-2010 saw both credit demand and supply decline, with the credit
market being in broad equilibrium. However, credit supply was the primary constraining factor in the credit
contraction.
Supply remains a constraint despite significant effort to clear bank balance sheets. With a significant
amount of outstanding liabilities having been paid off, and banks having offloaded NPLs to factoring
companies, supply has become relatively less of a constraint recently, but the estimates show that supply
constraints are still binding in credit outcomes.

A more regular pattern of treasury bill issuance should be pursued to facilitate
deepening of local financial markets. The increased liquidity in the banking system could support
greater demand for domestic debt and provide a more stable source of government financing, but
will need to be accompanied by steps to modernize current auction procedures, including
introduction of electronic bidding and settlement. Issuance should expand gradually, given the
sharp contraction in bank lending in recent years and concerns about possible crowding out.

Authorities’ views
32.
The cleanup of private balance sheets could take time. While agreeing on the need to
make the judicial process more efficient and predictable, and to tighten the regulation of factoring
companies, the authorities attributed the prevalence of unresolved loans primarily to banks’ and
factoring companies’ preference for waiting for higher asset prices over the medium term. They also
noted that because of the impairment of private sector balance sheets, the number of eligible
buyers of repossessed properties was effectively capped, limiting the volume of property sales.
33.
Continued cross-border coordination, even-handed application of macroprudential
regulations and good contingency planning has helped maintain financial stability. The
authorities noted that they were in constant touch with parents of Montenegrin subsidiaries and
their relevant national regulators. They are determined to preserve the integrity of the banking
system by ensuring that all banks comply with macroprudential regulations. In this regard, they felt
the recent increase in deposit insurance coverage to €50,000 beginning in 2013 further reassured
depositors. The authorities consider the current contingency planning framework as adequate, but
are working on further refining it, based on MCM’s technical assistance recommendations.
34.
There may be limits to the extent the domestic treasury bills market could be
deepened. The authorities indicated that they had begun to test the Treasury bill market with larger
issuance recently, but even a slight increase in the volume of sales was accompanied by a steep
increase in yields. With weak credit demand, and banks’ search for higher yields, there may be a
need to reconsider the maturities offered in the market. They were uncertain if bank interest in
domestic treasury bills would be sustained once credit to the private sector picked up.

D. Accelerating Reforms to Boost Medium-Term Growth
35.
Potential output appears to be stagnating as investment to realize the untapped
potential in tourism and energy has not fully materialized. Output growth in recent years has
been driven by tourism; however, the sector appears to be approaching capacity constraints (see
Box 2). Montenegro has significant opportunity to develop its tourism as well as become a regional
electricity hub, but improvements in the business climate and further upgrading of infrastructure are
essential to attract foreign investment into these sectors.
36.
Efforts to sustain KAP have distorted resource allocation, and consumed scarce
budgetary resources. KAP has been unable to break even because of high input costs, and so far,
interventions to support it have failed to put the company on a sustainable footing despite
considerable fiscal costs. Staff’s analysis, including that in the 2012 Article IV Consultation, suggests
that the prospects for a durable long-term solution—one that is subsidy-free and extinguishes
outstanding debts and liabilities—are limited, and it appears inevitable that KAP cannot be
sustained without unduly burdening taxpayers for years.

Box 2. Tourism and Growth in Montenegro1
Tourism has been a major growth driver.
Montenegrin tourism has experienced substantial
growth in recent years. It accounted for over
70 percent of exports of goods and services in
2012, and GDP growth has closely tracked tourism
growth. The volatility of tourist arrivals in
Montenegro is one of the lowest among the small
states that heavily rely on tourism. Tourism also has
a large positive externality on the economy through
its effects on ancillary activities. Staff estimates
show that a 1 percent increase in tourist arrivals in
Montenegro is associated with 1.2 percent increase
in GDP.
However, the sector’s growth momentum is
waning. Capacity constraints are beginning to
emerge, while the weak economic outlook in the
primary tourist markets is likely to put a cap on
prospects for further growth. Montenegro earns less
per visitor than many other tourism-intensive
countries. The earning ability of the sector is limited
by the preponderance of unregulated and informal
activities that hinder high-quality investments (and
fiscal revenue intake). About 8 in 10 tourist
accommodations are unregistered rental apartments,
and informal businesses offer low-quality services
with minimal value added, and without internalizing
the negative externalities, including to the
environment.

For the sector to be a sustainable driver of growth over the mediumterm quality should be upgraded
and activities diversified. A broad-based strategy is needed for tourism development, complemented with
targeted investments and improved regulation at both central and municipal levels. In addition, Montenegro
should strive to extend its visitor base globally and to higher-end visitors, and diversify to noncoastal
tourism to lower the seasonal volatility of the country’s tourism earnings.2 However, such a strategy would
require investment in tourism-related physical and social infrastructure, and continued improvement in the
business climate.

economy have performed poorly. Cost
competitiveness is an issue. Montenegro’s unit labor costs (ULC) is higher than in other countries in
the region (except Serbia) and wage growth in 2008–11 has slightly exceeded productivity changes,
largely because a multi-tiered wage bargaining process that complicates private sector wage
outcomes—ULC has risen by 3 percent since 2008 despite the weak economic environment
(see Box 3).

Staff advice
38.
Budgetary support for KAP should be discontinued and eventual liquidation pursued
under a clear plan. The recent downsizing of the plant is welcome, and while eventual liquidation
of KAP, in the context of an appropriate compensation framework for redundant employees, would
entail a drag on growth and additional fiscal costs in the short-term, it would also release scarce
resources, including energy, for exports and activities in which Montenegro has considerable
potential.
39.
Further improvements in the business environment are essential. Staff advised the
authorities to reduce the frequency of regulatory changes—which investors see as significant
obstacles. Streamlining procedures for obtaining business licenses and permits and improving
transparency at the municipal level would also help. Staff welcomed recent initiatives to formalize
grey economy activities and saw potential for fiscal dividend and growth. Finally, staff encouraged
the authorities to strengthen their efforts against corruption and organized crime, including by
effectively implementing the AML/CFT regime.

Box 3. Montenegro: External Competitiveness
Export performance has continued to improve, despite modest deterioration in competitiveness, as measured
by REER and RULC. The CPI-based REER appreciated in 2012 because of the firming of the euro relative to other
currencies, and cost indicators also suggest deterioration as

wage growth outpaced modest gains in productivity (especially
102
during 2008–09). Montenegro’s share in world exports has risen
100
steadily, however, largely because of resilient tourism demand.
98
This partly reflects a catching up process, as tourist arrivals had
96
dropped off dramatically during the Yugoslav conflict, but also
94
the emergence of a more competitive tourist sector, relative to

the rest of the economy.

Recent improvements in the current account have been
partially driven by the economic slowdown. Since 2008, the
current account deficit has declined sharply as a result of lower
imports, driven primarily by credit contraction and the bursting of
the asset bubble, as well as cuts in import-intensive capital
spending by the government.

Staff analysis of the current account points to an imbalance,
but the estimates are subject to considerable uncertainty.
There appears to be a prospective medium-term overvaluation of
the real exchange rate under the Macroeconomic Balance and
External Sustainability approaches. However, data uncertainties
(related to errors and omissions in the balance of payment, which
amount to about 7 percent of GDP), the short length of the time
series and the volatility associated with small countries make
point estimates from a CGER-type analysis imprecise and
potentially misleading. Further, while the external current account
deficit appears high at 18 percent of GDP, more than half of this
represents imports related to FDI.

40.
Labor market reforms are indispensible for competitiveness and should be accelerated.
Staff advised that the collective bargaining system should allow more independent wage setting at
industry and firm levels, including by expanding the use of fixed-term contracts (currently limited to
a single two-year contract). The design of social protection should be altered so it does not
discourage the unemployed from taking up jobs, and labor regulations (particularly those related to
limits on fixed term contracts) eased so they do not deter job creation. 6
41.
The quality of economic statistics needs to be improved. While data are generally
adequate for surveillance, some weaknesses remain, especially in national and external accounts.
Progress has been made over the past year, including through the introduction of quarterly national
accounts and improved measurement of tourism receipts, but adequate resources should be made
available to ensure effective use of TA in these areas.

Authorities’ views
42.
The authorities have considered several options for resolving the problems at KAP.
They worry about the social and economic impact of KAP closure—they argued that KAP is still the
largest employer in the country, and supports a number of ancillary service providers. On the one
hand they were optimistic that an agreement could be reached to supply the company with
electricity at a price that would allow the company to break even, and that investors could be found
to develop higher value added production. However, they also acknowledge the risks with this
strategy and were prepared to pursue bankruptcy in the event that such an agreement could not be
reached.
43.
Various business climate reforms and labor market initiatives have been taken
recently. The authorities highlighted recent efforts to adopt a law on spatial planning and reduce
the cost of obtaining construction permits. They pointed to a nine-month apprenticeship program
introduced this year to help new college graduates gain work experience as an initiative that should
help to bridge the gap between skills demanded and supplied in the labor market.
44.
Further improvements in economic statistics are limited by budget constraints. The
authorities pointed to budgetary limitations that constrain progress in this area. They also
emphasized the challenges posed by Montenegro’s use of the euro and the nature of tourist activity
in accurately measuring the sizes of the grey economy and of cross-border economic activities.

STAFF APPRAISAL
45.
Montenegro is still struggling with the challenges created by the buildup of debt in
the aftermath of the lending boom. The rapid rise in public debt since 2009 has increased
vulnerabilities and left little fiscal space for much-needed investment, while the large stock of bad
loans has resulted in a debt overhang in the private sector that constrains investment and growth.
46.
Last year’s output contraction was heavily influenced by adverse weather conditions,
and a modest rebound is likely this year. However, scope for tourism to continue to drive growth
is likely diminishing in the absence of investment to expand and upgrade capacity, while decreasing
output in the struggling aluminum sector will continue to be a drag on activity. Montenegro has
significant potential in energy and tourism, but this will require improvements in the business
climate to facilitate greater inflows of foreign investment into these sectors, including by
strengthening anti-corruption efforts.
47.
A sustained, multi-year fiscal consolidation effort is needed to reduce the public debt
burden to an appropriately low level over the medium term. Financing constraints and the risk
of a loss of market access, as highlighted by the recent spike in global risk aversion, will continue to
be a concern while financing needs remain elevated. Aiming to return public debt to its 2008 level
(as a share of GDP) in 10 years would be appropriate, but the challenges entailed in achieving it
would mean sustained fiscal effort in future years. The use of a fiscal rule could help, by providing
structure and discipline to fiscal policy, but for this to happen, the authorities would need to ensure
such a rule embeds an appropriately ambitious medium term debt target and is operationally viable.
The absence of a currency underscores the need for gradually building up a fiscal reserve buffer by
opportunistically tapping external financing markets over the near and medium term.
48.
Recent fiscal measures are welcome but more will be needed in future years. The fiscal
consolidation measures adopted for 2013 should stem the pace of debt accumulation, but these will
need to be extended into 2014 and beyond in order to put public debt on a declining path.
Additional savings will also be required next year to offset expected outlays to repay loan
guarantees related to KAP. The growing financing gap in the pension fund has cramped the fiscal
space, and serious front loaded reforms are needed in this area to allow savings for 2014 and
beyond, including, to meet fiscal contingencies. Efforts to improve the targeting of social spending
are welcome, and should be expanded.
49.
Limited progress on NPL resolution has left private sector balance sheets burdened
with very high debt, risking a prolonged period of sub-par growth. It is essential to remove
structural distortions that hinder the cleanup of private sector balance sheets, including lengthy and
ad hoc judicial processes that delay collateral execution. Efforts should also focus on improving the
accuracy of appraisals, strengthening the land registry, and advancing auditing standards.
50.
Moving KAP toward liquidation appears to be the least cost option, one that would
also improve resource allocation. Prospects for a durable long-term solution that allows the
company to operate profitably while paying market prices for electricity appear limited, and it seems
18 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MONTENEGRO

inevitable that continuing KAP in its current structure would require further fiscal support—at a time
when the authorities are forced to take difficult decisions to raise taxes and curb spending. While
liquidation could entail some near term fiscal costs, it would remove the specter of continual
subsidies from the budget, release scarce resources that can be employed more productively,
including electricity for exports, and permit the parts of the operation that remain viable to be sold
to private investors.
51.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Montenegro be held on the
standard 12-month cycle.

The adjustment scenario is based on the following assumptions: 1) The closure of KAP in 2014, which results in
one-off fiscal costs of 1 percent of GDP, and a temporary drop in output and exports; 2) Fiscal consolidation in
2013–16 and a subsequent reduction in public debt, reflecting an extension of the freeze in pension
adjustments and downsizing of the public wage bill initiated in 2013, allowing higher capital spending ;
3) Acceleration of critical structural reforms to improve the business environment, providing the basis for a
pick-up in FDI in electricity and tourism, two key areas of comparative advantage; 4) A pick-up in exports
beginning in 2015, reflecting increased FDI and supporting faster growth in real GDP.

1/ Balance of payments data were revised in late 2012 to correct for unrecorded tourism receipts, resulting in an average annual improvement in the
current account balance of 1.7 percent of GDP in 2009-2011. This revision has not yet been incorporated in the national accounts data, which
results in the large discrepancy between the current account balance and the savings-investment balance calculated from the national accounts.

1/ Balance of payments data were revised in late 2012 to correct for unrecorded tourism receipts, resulting in an average annual
improvement in the current account balance of 1.7 percent of GDP in 2009-2011. The revision also lowered the estimate of other
investment outflows, with a corresponding reduction in errors and omissions.
2/ Sovereign Eurobond issuance is classified under Other Investment rather than Portfolio Investment in this presentation.
3/ This includes only estimates of private external debt as private debt statistics are not officially published.

1/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in Euro terms, g = real GDP growth rate,
e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; Euro deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, Euro deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels
of the last projection year.

Relative Likelihood

Impact if Realized

Medium
Montenegro has found it very difficult to
access external capital markets during
several periods over the past 18 months.
Eurobond spreads are currently at roughly
520 basis points, but were between
800–1000 basis points for most of 2012.
This risk is likely to remain over the
medium term as well.

Medium
Deposit buffers are thin, and the
small domestic capital market leaves
Montenegro heavily reliant on
external sources for budget
financing through the projection
period.

Medium
The authorities continue to seek a new
investor who could revive the fortunes of
KAP.

Medium
Additional expenditures associated
with commitments to KAP would
jeopardize the authorities’ ability to
deliver the needed medium-term
fiscal adjustment and exacerbate
financing pressures.

The company is not viable at market
electricity prices, however, and has heavy
indebtedness, over employment and large
investment needs. Any investor is likely to
demand financial assistance to deal with
these obstacles.

A shift in market conditions would
likely force Montenegro to take
more expensive direct bank loans,
putting further upward pressure on
interest costs.

Medium
The damage to potential output from the
financial crisis may be deeper than
expected; or deleveraging may have a
more severe impact on real activity.

Medium
A protracted regional slowdown
would likely have an adverse impact
on FDI and tourism, which are
expected to be key drivers of
medium-term growth in
Montenegro.

Medium
Although the banking system appears to
be stabilizing, the sector as a whole
remains loss-making and NPLs continue
to rise. Foreign parents, facing pressures
in their home markets, could resist
possible demands for further capitalizing
Montenegrin subsidiaries.

Medium
A further contraction in bank lending
would be a drag on investment and
would likely stall economic recovery.

Appendix II. The Role of Supply and Demand in Explaining
Credit1
The prolonged credit contraction in Montenegro since the crisis is primarily supply driven,
including recently, notwithstanding the efforts to clean bank balance sheets.
1.
Bank lending in Montenegro has contracted significantly since the collapse of the
lending boom in 2008. After a cumulative increase of more than 900 percent during 2005–2008,
the level of outstanding credit has shrunk by
Domestic Credit and Foreign Liabilities

continued to contract in 2012, falling by

2.
Supply factors appear to have played a critical role in the credit contraction. On the
supply front, banks were faced with a large loss of deposits following the abrupt end of the lending
boom: from August 2008 to April 2009, the level of deposits in the banking system fell by nearly
40 percent. While parent banks stepped up their support for their subsidiaries in Montenegro in the
short-term in order to ensure that they were able to meet liquidity needs, these credit lines have
been repaid over the past several years. As a result, subsidiaries have been forced to realign their
lending with their domestic deposit base: foreign liabilities as share of banks’ assets fell from over
40 percent in early 2009 to 23 percent in 2012. A tightening of lending standards is also a likely
contributor to the shrinking credit supply, as banks have become more cautious in light of the steady
deterioration of loan performance and the large stocks of NPLs. On the demand side, the economic
slowdown and uncertain outlook, and excessive debt overhang are likely to have weakened firm and
household demand for credit.
3.
A disequilibrium model that explicitly distinguishes credit demand from supply factors
is used to assess the actual determinants of credit growth. The estimation equation for credit
demand and supply are, respectively:

Appendix III. Evolution of Sectoral Balance Sheets and
Vulnerabilities1
While the process of balance sheet repair is ongoing in Montenegro, vulnerabilities in private
sector balance sheets are elevated, casting doubts on the prospects for speedy recovery of credit
and economic growth.

A. Commercial Banks
1.
Commercial bank balance sheets have been downsized in the aftermath of the crisis.
Despite a gradual recovery in domestic deposits since the drop associated with the post 2008 crisis,
banks have been downsizing and shrinking their balance sheets in order to align their lending to a
more sustainable funding base.
2.
On the asset side, bank credit has been on a steady decline in the aftermath of the
global financial crisis. In large part, the decline in credit and banking system assets is related to the
accumulation of nonperforming loans (NPLs) over time. The sharpest decline has been in corporate
credit which currently stands at only about 55 percent of its pre-crisis level. On the other hand,
household credit has declined less rapidly, with credit now accounting for near 80 percent of its precrisis peak (see below).

3.
On the liability side, banks have steadily reduced their nonresident liabilities. This
decline reflects in part financial difficulties faced by parent banks. Nonresident liabilities are now
about 60 percent of their pre-crisis level. Domestic deposits have recovered gradually but still remain
below the pre-crisis level. Deposits are currently about 15percent lower than they were at their

4.
The corporate balance sheet remains
impaired, but the composition of corporate
liabilities has shifted over time. Total indebtedness
of the corporate sector has declined modestly, by
about 16 percent relative to the pre-crisis peak. While
corporate liabilities to banks have declined over time,
liabilities to nonresidents have increased considerably,
largely because of banks’ sale of NPLs from bank
balance sheets to asset management companies.
Corporate liabilities to banks are currently less than
half of their pre-crisis level. Unless there is a sizable
restructuring of corporate debt, balance sheets will
likely remain impaired, dimming the prospects for a
sustainable credit recovery.

Appendix IV. Tourism Development and Its Macroeconomic
Impact1
Tourism has become the main engine of growth in Montenegro in recent years, but the
sector’s momentum appears to be slowing as capacity constraints emerge. To fully realize
the potential of a more diversified tourist sector in Montenegro, there is a need for
investment to upgrade and expand capacity and relieve infrastructure bottlenecks.

The sector has proved to be
relatively resilient to external shocks in
recent years. The number of tourists visiting
Montenegro rose by 2 percent per year on
average during 2008–2009 despite the global
downturn, compared with a decline in the
number of visitors in comparator countries
that also depend heavily on tourism.

Tourism has experienced tremendous growth in Montenegro in recent years.
Tourism was a thriving sector during the Yugoslav era, but the number of visitors dropped
sharply during the regional turmoil in the aftermath of the breakup of Yugoslavia. The sector has
rebound briskly as the region has stabilized—inbound tourist arrivals have seen an average
annual increase of 18 percent between 2005 and 2012,2 in comparison to an annual growth of
worldwide tourism of 4 percent in the same

3.
Tourism has become the key
driver of growth in Montenegro as
many of the unrestructured
Yugoslav-era industries have
encountered difficulties. Service exports,
which are largely tourism-related, have
grown to over 70 percent of total exports
in 2012, from 58 percent in 2007. Not
surprisingly, G contribution to output and
exports, tourism also has a large indirect
impact on the economy. It positively
affects household income, employment,
and activity in tourism-affiliated services.

Inbound tourist arrival in Montenegro excludes tourists from Serbia, to ensure data are comparable between
pre- and post-independence periods.

MONTENEGRO

The tourism multiplier3 for Montenegro is in the high middle range compared to other
tourism intensive countries. Estimates of a structural VAR model, comprising real GDP, inbound
tourist arrivals, and exchange rate, show that a 1 percent increase in tourist arrivals in
Montenegro is associated with a 1.2 percent
increase in GDP.4 The impact of tourism on GDP
is mostly contemporaneous, and tourist arrival
shocks do not generate a long-run effect on
output.
4.
But the sector’s growth momentum is
waning, because of both external and
internal factors. The annual increase in tourist
arrivals has been in single digits since 2008, with
growth in overnight stays showing a similar
trend. Several factors have contributed to the
slowdown. The economic downturn in the
tourist sending countries has been an
important reason, while Montenegro’s real
estate bust and credit collapse following the
financial crisis have discouraged investment in
the sector.
5.
The lack of strategic planning and
weak regulation over the past few years
has raised sustainability concerns. The
sector’s expansion in the boom years was
dominated by small scale and/or informal
operations. Only 20 percent of the country’s
existing accommodation capacity is in the
form of hotel beds, while the rest comprises
apartments for rent and other private
accommodations, many of which are
unregistered. These operations occupy a
significant amount of land and other
resources, while generating little formal
employment and fiscal benefits. The
sector’s rapid expansion without sufficient

The model assumes that tourist arrivals affect GDP contemporaneously and with lags, while the latter only
affects the former with lags. For countries with a flexible exchange rate regime, the model assumes that the
exchange rate has a contemporaneous effect on tourist arrivals and GDP, while the opposite is not true. In other
words, the order of variables in the autoregressive vector is {exchange rate, tourist arrival, GDP).

coordination and planning has also strained local public infrastructure such as transportation and
sanitation.
6.
Cross-country analysis reveals that despite the strong overall growth in tourism,
Montenegro earns less per visitor than many other tourism-intensive countries. This is to
some extent because Montenegro has traditionally sourced its visitors mostly from the
neighboring countries that are in the low-to medium income bracket.5 But more importantly, the
earning ability of the sector is limited by the prevalence of small, unregulated operators that
offer low-quality services with minimal value added and without bearing the cost of negative
externalities, including to the environment.
7.
Looking forward, tourism can benefit from better regulation, upgrading of quality,
and greater diversification. Targeted investments in related infrastructure and better regulation
at both central and municipal levels could carry large benefits. In addition, there is a need for
greater diversification in the sector. About 90 percent of Montenegrin tourism is concentrated on
the coast, which is in high demand solely during the summer months. To increase the sector’s
value added, Montenegro should strive to extend its visitor base globally and to higher end
visitors, and further explore the tourism potential in its scenic mountainous areas in the north.
Diversification to noncoastal tourism and wider visitor base would also serve to reduce the
seasonal volatility of the country’s tourism income and GDP.
8.

Montenegro also needs to continue reducing the costs of doing business, such as the cost of

WORLD BANK GROUP RELATIONS
Montenegro joined the World Bank Group (WBG) as an independent country in January 2007.
The Bank had implemented a discrete program of lending and analytical work for Montenegro for
most of the period since the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro had joined the WBG in 2001,
with three projects still being active at the onset of Montenegro’s first Country Partnership Strategy
(CPS) for the fiscal years 2007–10. Within this framework, the Board approved two IDA credits
(US$19 million)—just prior to graduation—and five IBRD loans (US$54 million) to provide selective
support to three key country priorities: (i) enhancing sustainable macroeconomic growth; (ii)
building institutions and strengthening the rule of law; and (iii) improving the standard of living for
citizens. The committed portfolio has grown from US$34 million in 2007 to US$70.3 million by
May 2013. About 52 percent of these commitments remain to be disbursed. Investment operations
are focused principally on supporting sustainable development and human development.

In January 2011, the Board approved the US$ 216-million CPS for FY2011–14. This CPS
supports the government’s overarching objective of full integration with the EU within a mediumterm horizon. The strategy—reflecting Montenegro’s status as an upper middle income client with
well-defined development priorities—aims at (i) strengthening institutions and competitiveness in
line with EU accession requirements; and (ii) improving environmental management including
reducing the costs of environmental problems. The government has requested the Bank to focus its
support in areas where it had previously been engaged and/or gained applicable regional or global
experience. The centerpiece of the Bank’s engagement in 2011 and 2012 was the financial-sector
development policy loan (FSDPL) of US$80 million and a Policy-Based Guarantee (PBG) of
US$80 million, both disbursed in 2012, which supported the government’s program to strengthen
the banking sector, bringing regulations into line with EU norms, and to encourage resumption of
credit growth. The Bank’s engagement in 2013 is focused on a US$50 million development policy
loan that provides budget support to strengthen fiscal consolidation and policies geared towards
sustained growth. New investment lending was approved for a Higher Education/R&D project in
amount of US$16 million, while an additional new investment lending for the Industrial Waste

Management and Clean-Up Project is being prepared. In the area of analytical work, the Country
Economic Memorandum (CEM), disseminated in May 2013, provided analytical support to the
authorities’ National Development Plan, which aims to implement Montenegro’s growth and
sustainability agenda in the process of convergence with the EU.
Cooperation with the IMF has been good, particularly in the areas of macroeconomic and
financial sector policies. Bank and Fund teams coordinated closely during the preparation of the
FSDPL and PBG in 2011 and 2012 and continued under the Public Expenditure Development Policy
Loan (PEDPL). The World Bank Group, through its ongoing and planned operations, as well its
complementary economic and sector work, will continue to provide input to the IMF on issues such
as (i) public expenditure, including pension and health reforms; (ii) business climate and
competitiveness, including labor market reform and resolution of nonperforming loans; (iii) public
sector institutions and fiduciary review, and (iv) agricultural assessment; and (v) statistical capacity
building and poverty monitoring. The Fund and Bank staff have sought each other’s input in internal
review processes.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
MONTENEGRO—STATISTICAL ISSUES APPENDIX
As of May 2013
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. Most affected areas
are: national accounts, labor market indicators, and external sector statistics.
National Accounts: The Statistical Office of Montenegro (MONSTAT) compiles annual production and
expenditure GDP in current and previous year’s prices, and quarterly GDP by production at aggregated level
(mostly NACE section level). Accuracy of the data sources needs to be improved. Work has started on
measuring informal activities in construction, retail trade, hotels and restaurants, but a more comprehensive
approach needs to be developed. Statistical techniques for deriving volume measures of GDP are constrained
by the lack of suitable price and volume indices. MONSTAT has started compiling experimental quarterly GDP
estimates by expenditure approach at current and at previous year’s prices. Data collection for quarterly GDP
by production approach has started too. MONSTAT plans to publish time series of quarterly GDP estimates by
production and by expenditure approach in late 2014.
Price Statistics: MONSTAT compiles and disseminates monthly consumer and producer price indices, which
broadly follow international standards. However, in both indices, the “carry-forward” technique for treatment
of seasonal goods and missing items are used, potentially resulting in a downward bias. The EU harmonized
consumer price index was compiled and released starting in 2011. The export price index has been published
since 2009, and the industrial import price index since 2011. There is a need to develop a construction price
index.
Labor market statistics: MONSTAT reports labor and wage statistics based on data from the labor force
survey (LFS) and administrative sources. The unemployment rate from the LFS is computed according to the
ILO definition. The quality of wage indicators is relatively good, but information on foreign employment
remains limited. The presence of larger informal sector impedes the accurate assessment of unemployment
rate. Frequent methodological revisions also impair time series analyses.
Government Finance Statistics: Fiscal data are compiled by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) based on a new
GFS institutional classification, and since early 2006, include data on local governments and social security
funds. The latter was merged with the treasury account in 2010. The chart of accounts introduced in 2001 has
been implemented at the local level from mid-2005. Fiscal data reporting suffers from frequent reclassifications. The MOF has established a unit responsible for data collection for state-owned enterprises
(SOE), but a satisfactory compilation of the public sector fiscal balance requires significant further effort. Data
on enterprises owned by municipalities are rarely available. Data on the stock of local government arrears need
to be significantly strengthened and disseminated. Data on stocks of financial assets and liabilities are
incomplete.
The latest GFS TA mission in March 2013 recommended updating the table on the institutional structure of the
public sector to facilitate consistency among producers of official statistics. It was also recommended to
establish a migration plan to phase in the GFSM 2001 framework and to start publishing quarterly budgetary
central government data in the IFS.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MONTENEGRO

Monetary and Financial Statistics: Monetary and financial statistics are compiled by the Central Bank of
Montenegro (CBM), broadly following the institutional coverage, classification, and evaluation methodology
set forth in the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (2000). Dissemination practices meet the
recommendations of the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) with respect to the periodicity and
timeliness for financial sector data. However, Montenegro reports monetary data to STA based on old
reporting forms rather than in the Standardized Report Forms (SRFs). Montenegro also does not report FSIs to
STA.
Beginning in early 2006, the CBM publishes detailed monetary statistics in its monthly Statistical Bulletin, which
includes tables on monetary statistics, balance sheets and surveys for the CBM and commercial banks. At the
beginning of 2013, the Central Bank of Montenegro adopted new financial reporting requirements for banks in
line with IAS 39; as a result, monetary data for 2013 is not comparable with data from previous years.
External sector statistics: Balance of payments (BOP) statistics are compiled by the CBM following
international reporting standards. The external sector statistics have benefited from improvements undertaken
by MONSTAT to improve coverage, valuation, and classification of merchandise trade statistics. Data on
imports and exports in the BOP are compiled according to the special trade system. The CBM adjusts import
data from MONSTAT from CIF to FOB basis.
The biggest challenge to the BOP statistics is the coverage of transactions through the informal economy. As
with many euroized economies, difficulty in estimating currency held by nonfinancial sectors continue to be an
issue in the balance of payment statistics, as the large and recurrent positive error and omissions show.
Although the errors and omissions have diminished recently due to (i) the upward revision of export of tourism
(services) and (ii) the downward revision of euro bank notes (currency and deposits) cumulated in the
economy, they are still large and with a positive bias. The CBM has made progress in improving the recording
of transactions via the ITRS by refining the transactions coding system and increasing interaction with the
commercial banks. However, the ITRS remains inadequate for recording a broad range of balance of payments
transactions such as reinvested earnings and trade credits as well as the informal payments that do not flow
through the banking system. Therefore, the CBM still needs to undertake a small number of direct surveys of
enterprises and a border survey among travelers to supplement the data received through the ITRS, and
prepare comprehensive documentation on compilation methods and data sources.
Due to capacity constraints and the difficulty to differentiate between domestic and foreign financial positions
in an open economy that does not have its own currency, Montenegro has yet to disseminate data on
International Investment Position (IIP) and external debt statistics.
The latest BOP TA mission in January 2013 concluded with the following action benchmarks: (i) the compilation
and regular dissemination of the IIP and external debt statistics; (ii) the revision of the compilation of the flows
in currency and deposits assets by other sectors; and (iii) the improvement of the currently estimation
procedure for the item Compensation of Employees (credit).

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
August 28, 2013

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with Montenegro
On July 22, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with Montenegro and considered and endorsed the staff appraisal without a
meeting on a lapse-of-time basis.2
Montenegro’s recovery from the collapse of the lending boom in 2008 has been slowed by the debt
overhang that remains in the private sector. Output contracted in 2012 because of unusually severe
winter weather early in the year, as well as a sharp decline in aluminum production as the financial
position of the troubled aluminum company (KAP) continued to worsen. Activity picked up in early
2013 as more favorable weather conditions resulted in a sharp increase in hydro-based electricity
production, but the metals sector has remained a drag on activity.
Public debt has risen sharply in recent years as large structural fiscal deficits at the end of the credit
boom have proved difficult to unwind. The authorities undertook sizable fiscal adjustment in 2012,
but the level of debt continued to rise, reaching 52 percent by end year. The authorities have taken
several significant measures to underpin their ambitious 2013 budget, which targets a further
structural adjustment of 1¾ percentage points, including a freeze in pensions and an increase in the
standard VAT rate.
The banking system adjustment is at an advanced stage after a massive downsizing following the
collapse of the credit bubble, but banks continue to struggle with a large stock of nonperforming
loans (NPLs). Banks have aggressively sold off NPLs to factoring companies, but the latter have

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every
year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the
country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the
basis for discussion by the Executive Board. The Executive Board takes decisions under its lapse of time procedure when
it is agreed by the Board that a proposal can be considered without convening formal discussions.

moved slowly with resolution or restructuring of these problem assets, leaving private balance sheets
still impaired. This has contributed to a negative feedback loop whereby sluggish private sector
demand is contributing to weak economic activity and a further deterioration of asset quality. As a
result, new bank lending remains limited, despite a steady recovery in deposits.

KAP has been downsized but fiscal costs and risks remain. The company has continued to require
significant fiscal support, in direct subsidies as well as accumulated electricity bill arrears, and the
government had to guarantee its loans in 2009. The authorities have recently launched bankruptcy
proceedings in the local commercial court.
Executive Board Assessment
Last year’s output contraction was heavily influenced by adverse weather conditions, and a modest
rebound is likely this year. Declining output in the struggling aluminum sector will continue to be a
drag on activity. Montenegro has significant potential in energy and tourism, but this will require
improvements in the business climate to facilitate greater inflows of foreign investment into these
sectors, including by strengthening anti-corruption efforts.
A sustained, multi-year fiscal consolidation effort is needed to reduce the public debt burden to an
appropriately low level in the medium term. Financing constraints and the risk of a loss of market
access, as highlighted by the recent surge in global risk aversion, will continue to be a concern till
financing needs dissipate. Aiming to return public debt to its 2008 level (as a share of GDP) in 10
years is appropriate, but it would require sustained fiscal effort in future years.
The authorities’ recent fiscal measures are welcome as they would stem the pace of debt
accumulation in 2013, but these will need to be extended into 2014 and beyond to put public debt on
a declining path. The growing financing gap in the pension fund has cramped the fiscal space, and
serious front-loaded reforms are needed in this area to allow savings for 2014 and beyond, including,
to meet fiscal contingencies. Efforts to improve the targeting of social spending are welcome, and
should be expanded.
Limited progress on NPL resolution has left private sector balance sheets burdened with very high
debt, risking a prolonged period of sub-par growth. It is essential to remove structural distortions that
hinder the cleanup of private sector balance sheets, including lengthy and ad hoc judicial processes
that delay collateral execution. Efforts should also focus on improving the accuracy of appraisals,
strengthening the land registry, and advancing auditing standards.
Moving KAP toward liquidation appears to be the least cost option, one that would also improve
resource allocation. Prospects for a durable long-term solution that allows the company to operate
profitably while paying market prices for electricity appear limited, and it seems inevitable that
continuing KAP in its current structure would require further fiscal support—at a time when the

3
authorities are forced to take difficult decisions to raise taxes and curb spending. While liquidation
could entail some near term fiscal costs, it would remove the specter of continual subsidies from the
budget and release scarce resources that can be employed more productively, including electricity for
exports.
