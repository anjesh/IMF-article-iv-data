awaiting approval by the National Assembly. The authorities continued with efforts
(including in a GCC regional context) to enhance the regulations pertaining to Islamic
financial institutions and increase their supervision by the CBK. To the mission’s call for the
removal of the ceiling on bank lending rates, the authorities responded that this was
politically difficult and required amendment of the CBK law as well as the commercial law,
and that the ceiling was generally non-binding with most credit extended at below the
maximum rate (Box 1).

The Kuwait Stock Exchange (KSE) recovered during the first quarter of 2001
and the mission welcomed the opening of the stock exchange to foreign investors and
the strengthening of regulations regarding disclosure and insider trading. It encouraged
the authorities to further facilitate the participation of foreign investors by expediting the
revision of the income tax law, reforming the company law, and further strengthening
supervision and the enforcement of regulations.
C. Structural Reform
16.
The structural reform process has advanced significantly since late 2000. The
National Assembly has passed key elements of the reform package, including the laws on
foreign portfolio investment (September 2000), foreign direct investment (March 2001), and
key components of the labor market reform (May 2000). Additional measures that do not
require legislative approval are being introduced, such as increases in fees and charges on
government-provided services. Other important initiatives such as the privatization law, the
reform of the corporate income tax law, and the company law are expected to be approved by
the National Assembly by end-2001. The recent appointment of a Committee for Economic
Reform has helped expedite the preparatory work and build broader support for the proposed
reform package. The mission encouraged the authorities to capitalize on this synergy by
rapidly putting in place the implementing regulations and the needed technical support
