EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Costa Rica’s economic performance since the last consultation has been strong. Despite
the oil price shock, growth has been high, supported by robust external demand and
favorable conditions in international capital markets. The short-term outlook is favorable.
However, the economy continues to face important vulnerabilities, including double-digit
inflation, high public debt, and financial dollarization.
President Arias’ administration, which assumed office in May, has set out an ambitious
reform agenda. Adoption of key reforms, such as the fiscal plan and ratification of the U.S.Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR), will require substantial efforts, given
the administration’s lack of majority in congress.
Discussions focused on the policies needed to reduce Costa Rica’s vulnerabilities,
enhance growth, and reduce poverty in a lasting way. The staff supported the authorities’
strategy, which includes a major tax reform, recapitalization of the central bank and greater
exchange rate flexibility, strengthened financial sector regulation, and ratification of
CAFTA-DR. Supportive global conditions provide a good opportunity to advance the reform
process.
Passage of a substantial tax reform is essential. It will allow additional spending in
infrastructure, education, and social areas, while achieving a sound overall fiscal position to
further reduce public debt, and support monetary policy. The staff recommended focusing
the tax reform on the income tax and the VAT and urged the authorities to achieve a primary
surplus of 2½ percent of GDP over the medium term.
To bring inflation down to low single digits, the authorities plan to recapitalize the
central bank and move gradually to a more flexible exchange rate regime. The staff
endorsed this approach, which would boost the effectiveness of monetary policy. As a first
step, the authorities plan to shift from a crawling peg to a narrow crawling band.
The health of the financial sector has improved, but important challenges remain. Key
areas for action include stepped-up management of foreign exchange risk in the banking
system and strengthened supervision of offshore banking activities. Staff also recommended
leveling the playing field between public and private banks.
The staff welcomed the authorities’ determination to seek ratification of CAFTA-DR
and approval of complementary reforms. The staff also supported efforts to strengthen
trade links with other partners and to address structural obstacles that affect competitiveness.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
This Article IV consultation provides an important opportunity to take stock of
Costa Rica’s achievements and the challenges ahead. Costa Rica is a country with a long
history of political stability and strong institutions. Since the last Article IV consultation
in 2004, the economy has grown rapidly, spurred by rising investment and exports. However,
high public debt, double-digit inflation, financial sector vulnerabilities, gaps in public
infrastructure and education, and enduring poverty remain well-recognized challenges.
2.
A broad consensus exists on the fundamental goal of placing the economy on a
faster growth path and on the strategy to achieve this goal. Staff’s interlocutors put
particular emphasis on enhancing macroeconomic stability, enabling the private sector to
create more employment, boosting public efforts in infrastructure and education, and making
further efforts to address social needs. Most also supported closer integration of Costa Rica
with the world economy, although some were leery of the form it would take and its potential
impact on long-standing institutions.
3.
The main challenge facing the new administration of President Arias is to
galvanize this broad consensus and implement on the reform agenda. Since the
May 2006 inauguration, investor and consumer confidence has surged on the expectation that
long-stalled reforms would now move forward. While President Arias’ party only holds 25 of
the 57 parliamentary seats, local observers widely credit the new administration with the
talent and experience needed to secure passage of key legislation. Nevertheless, given the
complexity of Costa Rican legislative procedures and political sensitivities, approval of
major reforms is likely to remain challenging.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
4.
Economic growth accelerated to close to 6 percent in 2005, despite the oil price
shock, while inflation remained high. Exports, including those of the electronics industry
(Box 1), spearheaded this rise in output.
Inflation and Real GDP Growth
Domestic demand followed suit, boosted by a
(in percent)
substantial acceleration of private investment 8

7 percent in the first quarter of this year,
and the monthly index of economic
activity (IMAE) showed a rate of growth
slightly above 7 percent for the 12-month
period ending in July 2006. Investment
rose particularly strongly (19 percent yearon-year in the first quarter), fueled by
large foreign direct investment inflows,
including into real estate, and improved
domestic business confidence. Growth has
been broad-based, with the most dynamic
sectors being agriculture, construction,
assembly operations in free trade zones,
telecommunications, and financial
services. Inflation has decelerated, falling
to 12 percent in July. In August 2006,
according to the new consumer price
index, it inched down further to
11½ percent.

The New Consumer Price Index
In August 2006, the National Institute of
Statistics introduced a new consumer price index.
It is based on an updated and expanded
consumption basket, derived from a household
survey conducted in 2004–05 (the previous index
relied on a 1987–88 survey). As a result,
education, transportation and other services
gained much weight in the CPI, at the expense of
food and clothing. The new index also
incorporates many statistical improvements,
including adjustments for quality changes. The
old and new CPIs were spliced, using July 2006
as the base period. Hence, until June 2007, 12month inflation measures will not be fully
comparable, given methodological differences
between the two series.

6.
The fiscal deficit declined to 3 percent of GDP in 2005, its lowest level in a
decade. The primary
Public Primary Balance and Debt
surplus reached a record
(In percent of GDP)
level of 2.1 percent of
60
GDP. The improvement
was due to buoyant

revenues, reflecting the

improvements in tax and

and strict spending

7.
The fiscal deficit fell further in early 2006, but it expected to widen for the year
as a whole. Thanks to continued tax buoyancy, capital spending restraint, and better
performance of the social security and public enterprises, the fiscal deficit was near zero
during the first five months of 2006, versus ½ percent of GDP in the same period in 2005.
For the year as a whole, the fiscal deficit is expected to reach 3½ percent of GDP, due to

7
seasonality in expenditure and higher spending on the new administration’s priorities, such
as education, housing and minimum pensions for the poor, and public security.

Box 1. Intel’s Impact On The Costa Rican Economy
Intel’s operations in Costa Rica are large relative to the host economy. Operations started in 1998. By
1999, Intel accounted for 38.7 percent of Costa Rica’s total goods exports and 17.7 percent of its goods
imports. In 2005, its share of exports was still 20 percent.
Intel’s accounts have been prone to volatility, reflected in Costa Rica’s GDP, trade and FDI income
figures. The table below shows Intel’s contribution to the growth and volatility of GDP and external trade
over the period 1996–03.

However, Intel has a more limited impact on the rest of the economy than its share in exports would
suggest, because of its high import propensity, capital-intensive nature, and tax-free status. As the figure
below shows, the arrival of Intel marked a widening of the GDP-GNI gap.

Despite a rising current account deficit, robust foreign direct investment and
other private capital inflows have boosted international reserves. In 2005, the large
deterioration in the trade balance, driven by a sharp increase in oil imports, was partly offset
by strong tourism receipts and a five-year low in profit remittances. Robust private capital
inflows, including a surge in FDI into real estate and inflows into local bonds, resulted in a
larger overall surplus for the balance of payments. In 2006, exports and imports continued to
grow strongly, and the trade deficit widened further. Reserve accumulation has, nonetheless,
continued, with NIR reaching US$2.4 billion at end-August, representing close to 4 months
of nonmaquila imports and 100 percent of short-term external debt (Figure 2, Tables 3 and
7).

only be partially sterilized. Credit to the
private sector expanded at a rate of 30 percent in the same period. As a share of GDP, credit
is expected to rise from 35 percent in 2005 to 38 percent in 2006. The increased pace of
credit growth reflected improved business expectations and a rise in investment demand, and
was funded primarily through sustained deposit growth (Figure 3 and Table 4).
10.
The health of the financial sector has improved, supported by a favorable
macroeconomic environment, but key vulnerabilities remain. Bank profitability reached
record levels, in both public and private banks. Reported asset quality indicators have
improved markedly, with nonperforming loans down to 1½ percent of total loans (Tables 5
and 6). While the banking sector remains dominated by public banks, recent acquisitions of
large private domestic banks by multinational banks have intensified the process of
consolidation in the sector. Significant vulnerabilities remain, however, stemming from high

The central bank maintains the rate of crawl by setting a daily reference exchange rate for intra-bank
transactions, at which it commits to buying or selling any excess demand or supply by banks. From April 2006,
a small spread was introduced between the buying and selling rates.

dollarization of assets and liabilities2, sizeable and inadequately supervised offshore banking
activities (equivalent, in terms of total assets, to one-fifth of the onshore banking sector), and
large, albeit decreasing, holdings of public sector bonds by public banks. If sustained, the
rapid increase in private credit growth could also have a negative effect on asset quality.

While Costa Rica’s social indicators compare well to those of the Central
America region and income distribution has recently improved, poverty has remained
significant. Income, health, and sanitation levels are much higher and poverty rates much
lower than in the region (Figure 4, Tables 8 and 9). Annual household surveys indicate that
income inequality has steadily declined since 2001, partially reversing a sharp increase in
inequality during the previous decade. Poverty has remained at around 20 percent in the last
decade.
III. OUTLOOK AND RISKS
A. Near-Term Outlook
12.
Economic growth is expected to exceed 6 percent in 2006 and then come down
slightly to around 5 percent in 2007. For the remainder of the year, activity will remain
supported by strong exports and investment, as well as robust private consumption. In 2007,
external demand growth, investor confidence, and a further rise of bank credit would

2

As Figure 3 shows, deposit and credit dollarization are still high (though they seem to have leveled), fueled
mainly by a small premium for investing in local currency and a dollar lending rate that is well below the
exchange-adjusted local currency rate. Liability dollarization may also have been fostered by the perception of
relatively low currency risk associated with the long-standing crawling peg regime.

10
continue to foster a rapid pace of growth. The slight deceleration from 2006 would stem
primarily from more subdued growth in the electronics sector and, possibly, a more
restrictive fiscal stance.

13.
While risks are evenly balanced for the remainder of 2006, they appear
somewhat tilted to the downside in 2007.
•

The Costa Rican economy is vulnerable to global downside risks, particularly a
sharper-than-expected slowdown in U.S. activity, and to the fate of domestic
reforms. With strong linkages to the United States through trade, FDI, and capital
flows, a decline in U.S. growth would weigh heavily on Costa Rica. A failure to
deliver on the reform agenda could also have a significant negative impact on
consumer and business confidence.

•

Conversely, exports and investment could continue to surprise on the upside. As
noted, strength in these factors has boosted short-term indicators of activity, which
have risen faster than forecast GDP growth for this year.
B. Medium-Term Outlook

Baseline Scenario
14.
The staff’s medium-term baseline scenario assumes passage and implementation
of key reforms in 2007, which would underpin growth and foster price stability. A
comprehensive fiscal reform and sound fiscal policy would allow for higher spending in
priority areas and put public debt on a sustained downward path (Appendix I). Inflation
would decline markedly, as the recapitalization of the central bank and a more flexible
exchange rate regime increase the effectiveness of monetary policy. Implementation of
CAFTA would deepen integration within the region and with the U.S. market, spur FDI, and
boost exports.

No Reform Scenario
15.
However, in an alternative scenario characterized by the absence of reforms,
significant vulnerabilities would remain, leading to a weaker medium-term outlook.
Failure to introduce fiscal reforms would lead to a deterioration of the fiscal position. It
would also jeopardize the recapitalization of the central bank, potentially leaving in place
large central bank losses. Failure to ratify and implement CAFTA-DR would prevent Costa
Rica from taking full advantage of regional trading opportunities, affecting investor
confidence and the country risk premium. Overall, lack of progress on major reforms would
have a significant negative impact on investment, exports, growth, and poverty reduction.

Under this alternative scenario, the debt dynamics could become a source of
risk. Public debt would remain high, at around 50 percent of GDP by 2011, leaving the fiscal
position vulnerable to shocks. Under various illustrative shocks, public debt would move
above 60 percent of GDP; this would be the case following a permanent shock lowering
growth by half its historical (ten-year) standard deviation, a real exchange rate depreciation
of 30 percent, or a contingent-liabilities shock of 10 percent of GDP. A combination of such
shocks would obviously have an even more severe impact on debt dynamics.

IV. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
17.
Discussions centered on the authorities’ strategy to address Costa Rica’s
vulnerabilities, boost growth, and reduce poverty in a lasting fashion. The staff
supported the authorities’ overall strategy, which focuses on four policy areas:
(i) strengthening the fiscal position while allowing for higher and more efficient spending in
priority areas; (ii) recapitalizing the central bank and moving toward a more flexible
exchange rate system; (iii) enhancing regulation and supervision of the financial sector; and
(iv) ratifying and implementing CAFTA-DR. The authorities have submitted to Congress, or
are finalizing for submission, several draft bills including on tax reforms and the opening of
the telecommunication and insurance sectors.
18.
Recent years have seen a continuous and close dialogue between the Fund and
the authorities, but progress in implementing key reforms has been limited since the
last Article IV consultation. The staff has had frequent and constructive policy exchanges
with the authorities during the last two years. Substantial technical assistance has been
provided by the Fund, which the authorities have found useful for the design of major
reforms. However, due to political constraints, implementation of important reforms
highlighted in the previous Article IV consultation has been limited.
A. Fiscal Policy
19.
The authorities and staff agreed that a comprehensive tax reform needs to be at
the center of the reform agenda. This reform has three main objectives: entrenching public
debt sustainability, permitting recapitalization of the central bank, and allowing higher
spending in priority areas. To achieve these goals, the authorities indicated that they would
seek to increase tax revenue by 4 percentage points of GDP.

13
20.
The staff supported the thrust of the authorities’ tax reform plan, with one
exception. The plan included: (i) transforming the existing sales tax into a broader-base
value-added tax, while maintaining a tax rate of 13 percent; (ii) broadening the income tax
base; (iii) a tax on luxury residences; (iv) a flat tax on business registration; and (v) a
financial transactions tax (FTT). Staff recommended focusing efforts on reforms of the
income tax and the VAT, given their potential to yield substantial additional revenue
provided exemptions are strictly limited. It also noted that there was a potential to raise real
estate taxes, which were low by international standards. Staff expressed strong reservations
about the introduction of an FTT in light of international experience, which suggest that
FTTs are often an unstable source of revenue and can have a sizeable negative impact on
financial intermediation.
Key Elements of the 2006 Tax Reform

0.3
third from the income tax (this estimate does not
include an FTT, which has not been submitted to parliament). Given the congressional
agenda, approval of these bills is unlikely to occur before early 2007. Once adopted, some of
the reforms, such as the VAT, would yield additional revenue beginning in 2007, while
changes to the income tax would only have an impact in 2008. Thus, the tax reform could
bring in additional revenues of about 1.5 percent of GDP in 2007 and the remaining
1.0 percent of GDP in 2008. Should the authorities wish to raise more revenue, staff
suggested that consideration be given to raising the VAT rate by one or two percentage
points.

22.
The authorities and the staff agreed that a public sector primary surplus of
2½ percent of GDP is needed over the medium term.
•

This would bring about a reduction in public debt to about 40 percent of GDP
by 2011, which together with an improvement in debt structure, would reduce Costa
Rica’s vulnerability to exogenous shocks.

•

The implied increase in primary surplus of 1 percent of GDP, compared with 2006,
would be covered by the initial proceeds from the tax reform. Additional revenues
could then be allocated to higher expenditure in education, infrastructure, and social
need.

14
•

Recapitalization of the central bank should be a priority. The necessary transfer of
securities to the central bank would entail an estimated annual interest cost to the
central government of around 1¼ to 1½ percent of GDP. The additional tax revenues
from the tax reform would allow the central government to cover this annual cost,
without affecting noninterest budgetary spending or recurring to higher borrowing.

23.
In complement to the tax reform, the authorities and the staff discussed other
avenues to strengthen public finances:
•

Strengthening tax administration. Important measures have been taken in recent
years to strengthen tax administration. Further steps will be critical to ensure that,
once adopted by congress, the new tax laws can be effectively implemented. The Tax
Administration Directorate is likely to require additional resources for this purpose.

•

Reducing public expenditure rigidities. Constitutional mandates and extensive
earmarking of revenues result in great rigidity of budget expenditures. To make it
possible to reorient expenditure to priority areas, it would be useful to consider how
existing rigidities can be alleviated and new constraints avoided. For instance, the
legal framework could be strengthened to avoid unfunded spending mandates.

•

Developing a multiyear budget framework. A medium-term framework would
enhance policy transparency. In particular, it would clarify the links between the need
for additional revenues, reducing public debt, and additional spending in priority
areas.

•

Using efficient and transparent mechanisms to increase infrastructure
investment. A new public concessions law, which would reduce fiscal contingency
risks and make the procurement process more efficient, is expected to be adopted
soon. The authorities are committed to undertake spending on infrastructure in a
transparent manner. In the context of the Fund pilot project on public investment, the
staff evaluated two large public enterprises and concluded that, under current
regulations, one of them posed little risk for public finances. Thus, this enterprise
might be excluded from consolidated fiscal accounts, which could alleviate
constraints on investment.

•

Further enhancing public debt management. Significant progress has been made
on this front, which has resulted in lengthened debt maturities and a higher share of
debt at fixed interest rates. The policy of pooling all public funds in one account has
also improved cash flow and debt management. The staff suggested revising the legal
framework to facilitate pre-financing operations when market conditions are
favorable.

15
•

Strengthening regional tax cooperation. Efforts to attract investment should avoid
eroding the tax base. In this regard, the staff encouraged continued efforts to develop
a regional code of good practices on tax incentives for investment.3

24.
The draft 2007 budget recently submitted to parliament is consistent with the
fiscal strategy outlined above, but not without some risk. The budget, which in
accordance with the law does not reflect any anticipated revenue from tax reforms not yet
approved, envisages a broadly unchanged primary surplus. Additional spending, including a
new program of conditional cash transfers for poor families with children of school age as
well as increased outlays on social housing and roads, would be financed from savings on the
interest bill and buoyant tax revenues. The staff saw a risk that tax revenues may be
somewhat over-estimated and cautioned the authorities to maintain a prudent approach in
executing the budget.

B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
25.
The staff endorsed the authorities’ decision to move from a crawling peg to a
crawling band in the near future, as a first step toward greater flexibility of the
exchange rate. The long-standing crawling peg regime has served to maintain the real
exchange rate relatively stable, but its limitations have become apparent. In the face of
increasing capital inflows, the peg has rendered monetary policy largely endogenous, with
ensuing difficulties in the fight against inflation. The peg has also discouraged agents from
3

A key goal of the code of conduct would be to limit tax incentives for investment in order to avoid harmful
“tax competition” that would erode the (already) low revenue base of countries in the region.

16
hedging against exchange rate risk, thus stimulating liability dollarization and foreigncurrency lending to non-foreign-currency earners (Box 2). Accordingly, the staff supported
an initial switch to a relatively narrow band. As economic agents internalize currency risks,
the band should be gradually widened and the exchange rate replaced by another nominal
anchor. In light of the instability of money demand, an inflation target would ultimately be
the most effective anchor, provided that associated pre-requisites are in place.4 In the
transition toward greater flexibility, the authorities could consider steps to increase the
financial system’s foreign currency liquidity coverage, as financial dollarization can only be
expected to fall gradually (Box 2).
26.
The staff welcomed measures taken to facilitate the transition toward greater
exchange rate flexibility. In April 2006, a narrow bid-ask spread for foreign exchange
transactions with the central bank was opened in order to foster development of the interbank
market. The central bank has made progress in setting up a new electronic platform
(MONEX) to conduct foreign exchange market transactions. The authorities have also issued
new regulations to increase the limit on daily changes in banks’ foreign currency positions
and define the rules for central bank intervention in the exchange market. New regulations
for the development of exchange market derivatives and hedging instruments are being
prepared.
27.
In anticipation of the change in exchange rate regime, the authorities have taken
steps to modify the monetary policy framework. Since January 2006, the rate of crawl of
the exchange rate has been set based on expected rather than past inflation; this may help
anchor price expectations on the central bank’s announced inflation objectives. Regulations
on reserve requirements were amended to reduce day-to-day volatility. In March 2006, the
central bank changed its policy interest rate from the 30-day deposit rate to the overnight
deposit rate. Finally, the central bank decided to allow electronic deposits from the public
into its short-term deposit facilities, to enhance the transmission of policy rate decisions to
deposit rates in the banking system.

4

The authorities are currently working, with assistance from the Fund, to put in place the pre-conditions that
would eventually enable them to move to an inflation targeting framework.

17
Box 2. Financial Dollarization
Given the high level of financial dollarization in Costa Rica, the authorities are seeking to reduce the
exposure of the public sector and private borrowers to exchange rate risk and that of the financial
system to currency-induced credit and liquidity risks.
The banking system appears currently well-placed to cope with dollarization-related credit risk,
which stems from foreign-currency lending to non-foreign-currency earners. Forex loans to
nonforex earners account for 51 percent of credit by, and 370 percent of capital of, private banks.
Thus, a small default rate by nonforex earners could have a substantial negative effect on banks’
capital. However, cash flow analyses suggest that, given the relatively high average income of these
borrowers, only severe forex shocks would significantly impair their loan repayment capacity.
The high degree of dollarization is an underlying source of vulnerability of the financial system,
but does not pose a significant foreign-currency liquidity risk in the near term. The net liquid
forex assets of the banking system exceed dollar demand deposits. However, when broader sources of
potential dollar claims are included, the banking system’s liquid reserve assets are found to be below
those of other highly dollarized emerging markets. While there are no clear benchmarks for these
indicators, this evidence suggests that Costa Rica might consider boosting its foreign-currency
liquidity coverage (e.g., by enacting a liquidity requirement on foreign currency deposits), in parallel
with regulatory measures to reduce financial dollarization.

2/ STEDRM is short-term external debt on remaining maturity.
3/ "Dollarized" economies are defined as those with foreign currency deposits greater than 30 percent of total deposits.

Public debt structure has significantly improved in recent years, but is still sensitive to exchange
and interest rate movements. About half of public sector debt is denominated in foreign currency.
The share of short-term debt on remaining maturity (24 percent) is high by international standards.

28.
The authorities emphasized the need to recapitalize the central bank to eliminate
a large source of money creation. Staff recommended that the recapitalization be done in
one step through the transfer of standardized negotiable treasury securities, and in an amount
sufficient to restore the long-run solvency of the central bank in a low-inflation environment.
The staff also recommended that the recapitalization bill include a provision to limit growth
in the central bank’s operating expenditures and a rule on the transfer of eventual profits to
the central government.
29.
The authorities and the staff saw some limited scope to tighten monetary policy,
given the inflation objective for 2007. Under the current monetary and exchange rate policy

18
framework, room for maneuver is small. However, the increase in U.S. interest rates in the
first half of the year had opened some room to raise further domestic interest rates, without
necessarily triggering additional capital inflows.
C. Banking System
30.
Reforms to enhance financial sector supervision have proceeded at a steady,
albeit slow, pace. In July 2006, a reform to prudential regulations introduced a capital
requirement for pricing risk and raised the risk weighting for Costa Rican sovereign debt in
capital adequacy requirements. This has: (i) enticed public banks to reduce their asset
concentration in foreign currency denominated sovereign debt; and (ii) led to a downward
adjustment of capital adequacy ratios, which better reflect banks’ solvency.5 Significant
progress has also been achieved in the development of credit bureaus and the classification of
loan portfolios, thus improving the assessment of asset quality.
31.
The staff urged the authorities to accelerate and broaden financial sector
reforms. As noted above, the financial system still exhibits substantial vulnerabilities,
associated in particular with high levels of financial dollarization, offshore banking
operations, and sizeable sovereign exposure. The staff stressed the importance of the longplanned strengthening in the supervision of offshore banking activities. The authorities noted
that they were finalizing revisions to the package of banking supervision reforms previously
submitted to congress to simplify it and hence facilitate approval. The mission encouraged
the authorities to press ahead with measures to enhance financial institutions’ preparedness
for greater exchange rate flexibility, notably by facilitating the development of hedging
instruments against currency and interest rate risk. It also recommended that the supervisory
authority continue to strengthen the monitoring of banks’ asset quality and foreign currency
lending to non-foreign-currency earners. The staff suggested revisiting the regulatory
provisions favoring public banks so as to level the playing field between public and private
banks.

5

In 2005, the full implementation of deductions from regulatory capital of investment in financial institutions
led to a decrease in capital adequacy ratios, notably in public banks.

19
D. Trade and Competitiveness
32.
The authorities are moving toward greater trade liberalization on a regional and
bilateral basis. They are committed to seeking ratification of CAFTA-DR by congress and
are hopeful that this can be achieved in late 2006 or early 2007. In parallel, they are pressing
ahead with complementary reforms, such as the strengthening of ICE, the public electric and
telecommunications utility, and the opening of the telecommunications and insurance
sectors. Progress is being made within the Central American customs union on tariff, tax, and
customs issues. Discussions between Central American countries and the European Union on
an Association Agreement are to begin in 2007. The authorities are continuing discussions on
a free trade agreement with Panama, and exploring bilateral agreements with several other
countries.
33.
There is wide recognition of the main structural issues that must be addressed to
support the competitiveness of the Costa Rican economy. Deficiencies in infrastructure,
education, contract enforcement, property rights, business start-up costs, and export
procedures are well-identified (Figure 4). PROCOMER, the trade promotion agency, is
making progress toward simplifying and automating the required procedures for exporters,
and identifying targets for document clearance times. Nonetheless, lack of progress in
reducing regulatory costs could begin to affect Costa Rica’s relative attractiveness in the
region and globally (Box 3).
E. Other Issues
34.
The authorities informed staff that they stood by their commitment to deliver
debt relief in the context of the enhanced HIPC initiative. They mentioned that, following
a recent contact from the debtor country, they were hopeful that bilateral discussions on debt
relief terms would resume shortly. The authorities also noted that any provision of debt relief
would need to be approved by the legislative assembly. The staff indicated its readiness to
provide any assistance necessary on related technical matters.
V.

STAFF APPRAISAL

35.
Near-term prospects for the Costa Rican economy are favorable. Barring a
significant downturn in major partner countries, the economy is set to continue expanding at
a solid pace in the remainder of 2006 and 2007. Strong external demand, favorable
conditions in global financial markets, and improved domestic investor confidence has
underpinned a rise in economic growth.

20

Box 3. External Competitiveness
•

The real effective exchange rate (REER) is below its average level in the last decade (Figure 5).
The REER has remained flat since 2004, a period when it was estimated to be slightly below its
equilibrium level.

•

The current account deficit has deteriorated slightly over the past 10 years. A worsening of the
trade balance, partly explained by the oil price shock, has been offset by a dramatic increase in the
services balance.

•

Exports have been rising rapidly in recent years and the export base has diversified. Since 2003,
annual export volume growth has averaged close to 8 percent. And despite China's ascension, Costa
Rica's share in global trade has remained fairly stable in recent years, although its share in the
U.S. market has declined.

•

Overall, existing evidence suggests that the exchange rate level is not misaligned.

Despite its key strengths, lack of progress in reducing regulatory costs could begin to affect Costa
Rica’s relative attractiveness in the region and globally. Costa Rica’s ranking in the Global
Competitiveness Index is relatively high, underpinned by the country’s traditional advantages (its
generally better-educated workforce, political stability, and relatively low level of corruption). But the
country fell sharply in the 2007 World Bank’s Doing Business Report rankings, due to weak
performance in areas such as the time needed to start a business, import a standardized shipment,
register property, and obtain licenses.

36.
The key policy challenge is to keep the economy on a path of high growth, while
increasing its resilience to adverse shocks and addressing social needs. To achieve this,
policy priorities include a comprehensive fiscal reform, recapitalization of the central bank,
flexibilization of the exchange rate regime, strengthened financial regulation and supervision,
and ratification of CAFTA-DR.
37.
The staff supports the ambitious reform agenda laid out by the Costa Rican
authorities. The tax reform bills already submitted to congress are important steps in the
implementation of this strategy. Other bills, pertaining inter alia to the modernization and
opening of the telecommunication and insurance sectors, have also been submitted to
congress. Implementing these reforms will require continued strong efforts to consolidate
support in congress and among the wider public.
38.
Adoption of a broad tax reform is critical to bring public debt down, finance
priority expenditure, and support disinflation. The staff recommends focusing the reform
on the income tax and the VAT, given their revenue potential, and advised against
introducing a financial transactions tax. A successful tax reform should allow achievement of
a primary surplus of about 2½ percent of GDP, while also permitting higher expenditure on
education, infrastructure, and social needs.
39.
The authorities will need to resist spending pressures until the benefits of the tax
reform materialize. The draft 2007 budget appears consistent with this policy direction.
However, given some risk of overestimation of tax revenue, care will be needed in the budget
execution to ensure that the primary surplus target is reached. The staff welcomes the
authorities’ commitment to undertake needed infrastructure spending in a transparent
manner.
40.
The authorities’ decision to move to a crawling band regime and their intention
to recapitalize the central bank are well placed. These measures will enhance the
effectiveness of monetary policy in achieving a gradual reduction of inflation to low single
digits. The move to a narrow crawling band is the first step toward greater exchange rate
flexibility, and eventual adoption of an inflation target as a nominal anchor. Existing
evidence suggests that the current level of the real effective exchange rate is not misaligned.
41.
Reforms to strengthen the financial sector should be pursued vigorously. A clear
priority is to enhance the supervision of offshore banking activities. Consideration should
also be given to leveling the playing field between public and private banks. The staff
welcomes the steps already taken by the authorities to facilitate management of exchange
rate risk by financial institutions and supports further action in this area.
42.
The staff supports the authorities’ drive to ratify and implement CAFTA-DR as
soon as possible. Together with efforts to liberalize trade in a multilateral context, measures
to open up important sectors, and steps to simplify business regulations, implementation of

22
CAFTA-DR will further Costa Rica’s integration with the world economy, thus boosting
investment and growth prospects.
43.
Costa Rica should continue to play a strong and constructive role in fostering
regional cooperation. The staff encourages the authorities to promote a consensus on a code
of conduct in tax incentives for investment, which would help forestall harmful tax
competition among countries of the region. It welcomes Costa Rica’s active participation in
regional efforts to improve cross-border financial supervision and harmonize monetary and
financial statistics.
44.
Costa Rica’s economic statistics are adequate for surveillance purposes. The staff
welcomes the recent revision of the CPI, and supports ongoing efforts to improve the quality
of national accounts, fiscal, and balance-of-payments statistics.
45.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

1/ Gross public sector debt (Includes general government and the central bank).
2/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + αε(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; α = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and ε = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as αε(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Real GDP growth (in percent)
Average nominal interest rate on public debt (in percent) 8/
Average real interest rate (nominal rate minus change in GDP deflator, in percent)

VII. Exchange Rate Arrangements: Costa Rica’s current exchange arrangement is a
crawling peg. The central bank adjusts the exchange rate daily on the basis of the differential
between inflation in Costa Rica and its main trading partners. Costa Rica has accepted the
obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Articles of Agreement and maintains
an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for
current international transactions. Buying and selling exchange rates were 519.73 colones per
U.S. dollar and 522.06 colones per U.S. dollar, respectively, as of September 30, 2006.

ANNEX II. WORLD BANK GROUP RELATIONS WITH COSTA RICA
The current Costa Rica Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) covering the period FY04–FY07
was approved by the Board in May 2004. In accordance with government interest, the CPS is
a highly selective program of lending and AAA work focused more on knowledge transfer,
and less on resource delivery to tackle second generation challenges in key sectors. The
modest program includes six lending projects totaling $218 million spread over four years,
and is supplemented by five Bank analytical reports and several AAA advisory programs. It
supports reforms and initiatives critical to Costa Rica’s continued growth, social equality,
and sustainability, and is structured along four key pillars: maintaining macroeconomic
stability, strengthening trade and competitiveness, maintaining social inclusion, and
continuing environmental leadership.
Bank’s Assistance: Preparation advanced on four of the original six CPS pipeline projects.
The Board approved the education project in March 2005. Final preparation of Ecomarkets II
(Mainstreaming Market-based Instruments for Environmental Management) moved on
schedule during the transition period between administrations, indicating continuity in
support by the new government. Preparation of the E-government project was started, and
has recently been given new life by the higher profile the new administration has afforded
this agenda. Preparation of the Port City Limon project has been modest reflecting slower
than expected progress on the reform agenda in this area. Finally, activities under the water
project preparation grant were not initiated and the government has decided to pursue a
modified agenda with other financing sources.
In addition to the above lending operations, the CPS included technical assistance (TA)
activities to support government agendas in trade and competitiveness focusing on improving
telecommunications, insurance sector reform, debt management, and debt market
development. These TA activities have been quite successful in supporting development
efforts in these areas.
Analytical Reports. Five major reports were completed and shared with the authorities during
FY05–06. The two broad reports: The Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) and the
Poverty Assessment (PA) focused on topics relevant to the policy agenda of the new
administration. This has also been the case for the other three more specialized technical
reports, the Investment Climate Assessment (ICA), the Country Financial Accountability
Assessment (CFAA) and the Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR). As such, the
reports have been well received and provided a valuable tool for policy discussion with
strong links to other proposed assistance. The new government has also indicated interest in
the remaining report proposed in the CPS, a Public Expenditure Review, which will be
prepared for delivery in early FY08.

5
The Bank and the new government have discussed the remaining CPS activities and a
slightly revised program will be reflected in a CPS Progress Report that will be discussed by
the Board in early November.

ANNEX IV
COSTA RICA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Economic and financial statistics are adequate for surveillance purposes. The quality of
macroeconomic data has continued to improve in recent years. Further statistical
improvements are being pursued, including in the real, monetary, fiscal, and balance of
payments sectors. Costa Rica is in observance with the Special Data Dissemination Standards
(SDDS). The Central Bank makes data available to the public through regular official
publications at its website (http://www.bccr.fi.cr).
Real sector
A new consumer price index was introduced in August 2006 by the National Institute of
Statistics. It is based on an updated and expanded consumption basket, derived from a
household survey conducted in 2004–05. The new and old CPIs were spliced, using
July 2006 as the base period. The 2005 real GDP growth estimate was subject to a large
revision, driven largely by updated data from the high technology sector. The authorities are
looking at ways to enhance the timeliness and quality of the data collected from this sector.
Government finance statistics
Progress has been made in compiling public finance data according to the IMF’s
Government Finance Statistics Manual (GFSM 2001). A plan to migrate to GFSM 2001
was designed in 2004, and the authorities have developed an integrated financial system for
the budget and public debt, which provides an excellent point of departure. They are working
to further integrate systems for accounting, budgeting, and debt management.
A number of weaknesses remain, including on consistency and availability of
consolidated public sector data. These include discrepancies between above-the-line fiscal
figures and the financing side; and the need to standardize fiscal information on an accrual
basis. Nonfinancial public sector data are only published on an annual basis. A higher
frequency would be critical to improve transparency and monitoring of the overall public
sector.
Monetary statistics
Monetary and financial statistics are broadly in line with the IMF’s Monetary and
Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM). After successive TA missions (1996, 1998, 2001,
and 2003), several important improvements have been made to the classification, coverage,
and timeliness of the money and banking statistics. The central bank has been also working
with the standardized sectorization of institutional units, and the development of a unified

9
reporting system for monetary data that would meet the needs of STA and WHD. A
September 2006 mission reiterated that completion of this will be critical to improve
coverage and consistency between the monetary data published by the central bank and those
provided to the IMF, as well as the coverage and quality of the latter.
Balance of payments statistics
Substantial progress has been made in the estimation of quarterly balance of payments
and international investment position statistics. Costa Rica has published quarterly
balance of payment data since 1999 and annual international investment position (IIP) data
since 1996. In 2005, Costa Rica initiated the compilation and dissemination of quarterly IIP
data. The central bank is currently revising compilation in the area of foreign direct
investment (FDI)—including: the high-tech sector and real estate; portfolio investment; and
international reserves. Revised FDI data were published recently, including activity in the
real estate market by nonresidents. A TA mission visited the central bank in September 2006
to follow up on the recommendation of the March 2005 TA mission in Balance of Payments
and IIP statistics, and to provide assistance on this work. In September 2003, Costa Rica
initiated the dissemination of quarterly external debt position data with one quarter lag on the
central bank’s website with a hyperlink to the Fund’s website. In early-2006, the coverage of
these data was improved significantly, by including the short-term and private sector external
sector debt liabilities, and moving closer to the residence criteria recommended by BPM5 and
the External Debt Statistics: Guide for Compilers and Users.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
COSTA RICA
Staff Report for the 2006 Article IV Consultation
Supplementary Information
Prepared by the Western Hemisphere Department
Approved by Markus Rodlauer and Adnan Mazarei
October 24, 2006

1.
This supplement provides an update of economic policy developments since the
release of the staff report (see www.imf.org). The thrust of the staff appraisal remains
unchanged.
2.

Recent data confirm that economic activity is strong and inflation is slowing.

•
Real GDP rose by 7.1 percent in the second quarter of 2006 (year-on-year); and the
monthly index of economic activity (IMAE) went up by 7.3 percent in August 2006 (yearon-year).
•
Annual consumer price inflation fell to 11.2 percent in September from 11.6 percent
in August, largely on account of lower fuel prices.
3.
On October 17, the central bank replaced the long-standing crawling peg regime
with a crawling band.
•
The band is defined in terms of colones per U.S. dollar, and has an initial width of
3 percent. It will widen over time, as its floor and ceiling are set to crawl upward, at initial
rates of around 3 and 6½ percent per year respectively.
•
The change should progressively enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy.
Greater exchange rate flexibility will increase monetary policy autonomy, and help shift
price expectations away from the rate of exchange rate crawl and toward the central bank’s
announced inflation objectives. Combined with fiscal discipline and the recapitalization of
the central bank, as the authorities intend, it should permit a gradual reduction of inflation.

2
•
The regime change follows an intensive public information campaign and thorough
preparations by the central bank. Throughout the year, the monetary authorities
communicated to the public their intention to switch to the new regime, and a number of
regulatory and operational changes have been implemented to facilitate the transition. The
Fund has supported these efforts through close policy dialogue and extensive technical
assistance.
•
The first days of operations of the crawling band have gone smoothly. The colon
initially moved to the floor of the band, implying a nominal appreciation of 1.5 percent, and
has remained close to it since. Transaction volumes in the wholesale and retail foreign
exchange markets have been normal.

Statement by Moises Schwartz, Executive Director for Costa Rica
and Nina Conrado, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
October 30, 2006

On behalf of the authorities of Costa Rica we would like to convey their appreciation to IMF
staff and management for a constructive policy dialogue and valuable technical assistance.
The discussions of the 2006 article IV consultation were held a couple of months after
President Arias took office, providing for an excellent opportunity to discuss medium-term
objectives and policies to be carried out by the new administration.
Economic activity in Costa Rica continues to be strong. Even in a context of a negative oil
shock, the economy continues a broad base growth trend, supported by dynamism in
investment and exports. Increases in FDI, exports and tourism have strengthen international
reserves, compensating the expansion in the current account deficit resulting from a higher
oil bill. High international oil prices have also affected inflation, which, although still in
double digits, has started to decline. Credit growth has accelerated, in part reflecting an
improvement in confidence and positive expectations.
To continue with this positive macroeconomic context and to further advance in addressing
Costa Rica’s medium-term challenges, the authorities intend to carry out a broad reform
agenda, to continue with fiscal consolidation to reduce public debt, to fight persistent
inflation, to strengthen the financial sector, and to continue to boost private sector led growth
through further integration with the rest of the world.
Fiscal Policy
One of the main elements in the authorities’ medium-term agenda is to further advance
towards fiscal consolidation. The dynamism in economic activity, as well as improvements in
tax and custom administration have resulted in a buoyant revenue performance. This has
been coupled with a better control of expenditures and an improved debt management to
strengthen the fiscal balance. In 2005, the fiscal deficit declined to its lowest level in a
decade, resulting in a reduction in public debt. For 2006, initial estimates based on
information up to September, suggest that the primary balance of the Central Government
will be higher and its financial deficit will be lower than previously anticipated.
The government plans to lower the public debt level to about 40 percent in the medium term
and, at the same time, allow for additional resources to capitalize the Central Bank and
increase priority expenditures in the social sector and in infrastructure. To achieve these
objectives, the fiscal consolidation strategy has been centered on a comprehensive tax
reform. Taking into account Costa Rica’s legislative procedures, instead of sending one tax
package, the authorities have sent to the National Assembly three tax bills, which include

2
reforms to the value added tax, real estate tax, and business registration tax. The income tax
bill is still being negotiated and will be sent to the Assembly before the end of the year. The
authorities agree with staff that the core elements of this reform rely on the VAT and income
tax, and that, depending on the congressional agenda, the approval of these bills will be fully
observed as additional revenues in 2008. However, if the VAT and the real state tax are
approved in 2007, as it is expected, part of these revenues will be collected next year.
A draft 2007 budget has been submitted to Congress, in line with the objective of
strengthening fiscal discipline and consistent with the medium-term objective of bringing
down inflation. The proposal incorporates a prudent wage policy, additional efforts in terms
of tax administration and a redistribution of resources towards education, health, security and
public infrastructure.
Monetary Policy
As a first major step towards exchange rate flexibility, last week the Central Bank introduced
a system of bands for the exchange rate. After more than two decades with a crawling peg
regime, the new exchange rate system is oriented to regain control of monetary policy, with
the main objective of reducing inflation. This reform is part of the medium-term strategy to
move to a system of inflation targeting, for which the authorities are engaging in important
reforms in Costa Rica’s monetary policy framework.
In the context of a strong position of international reserves, fiscal discipline, and financial
stability, the Central Bank’s strategy has been based on two important blocks: gradualism
and transparency. During last year, in order to allow for greater degrees of freedom in
monetary policy, and to improve the transmission mechanism, monetary instruments have
been modified, incorporating changes in policy interest rate and reserve requirements, and
introducing an electronic window for direct investment in the Central Bank. In the foreign
exchange market, to allow for an orderly move to the system of a narrow band, the Central
Bank has issued new regulations, and a new electronic platform for foreign exchange market
transactions is being launched. Additionally, important efforts are being made to enhance the
Central Bank’s communication strategy.
The behavior of the foreign exchange market after the change in the system reflects a smooth
transition. The Central Bank has decided to maintain a crawling band using expected
inflation, and plans to gradually broaden the band. In the medium term, the Central Bank
expects that this measure will also help reduce financial dollarization. The authorities
recognize the presence of vulnerabilities in the financial sector, and are planning to continue
to make the necessary reforms to change the regulatory and supervisory framework to
strengthen banking supervision. They are also working on norms to allow for instruments to
cover exchange rate risk. Important efforts are also being made to strengthen supervision of
off-shore banking, including through regional initiatives.

3
The authorities believe that, in the medium term, the reforms being taken will allow them to
better deal with the main challenges in terms of monetary policy, including persistent
inflation and financial dollarization. These measures, coupled with the government’s
intention to capitalize the central bank and the resulting reduction of quasifiscal losses will
enhance the credibility of the new system and reduce inflationary expectations.
Structural reforms
Regarding the structural reform agenda, the authorities of Costa Rica plan to enhance the
country’s integration with the rest of the world. High in the government’s agenda is to
support the ratification of the US-Central American Free Trade Agreement, and to promote
other bilateral agreements such as the one being negotiated with Panama and the one that is
under discussion with the UE.
To complement this policy, the authorities are carrying out reforms to strengthen the
insurance sector and the public electric and telecommunications utility company (ICE). Last
week, the President signed a decree giving more flexibility in financial and investments
procedures of the enterprise, allowing it to invest up to US$ 435 millions in additional
resources. This effort will allow for the needed investment to modernize this sector and make
it more competitive.
Additionally, other efforts are being carried out to improve competitiveness and making the
economy more resilient to shocks, such as the recently approved law providing incentives to
organic agriculture.
Looking Forward
The authorities are aware of the challenges ahead, especially regarding gathering the
necessary consensus for important reforms. Nevertheless, the authorities are committed to
their reform agenda, which was clearly presented in their political platform and is now
perceived as a public mandate. The authorities believe that carrying out the expected reforms
will allow Costa Rica to continue growing at a steady rate, enhance macroeconomic stability
through fiscal consolidation and reduce inflationary inertia and, more importantly, improve
social indicators and allow for a reduction in poverty.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation with Costa Rica
On October 30, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Costa Rica.1
Background
Since the last Article IV consultation, the economy has strengthened. Real GDP
grew 5.9 percent in 2005, driven mainly by exports and private investment,
while inflation rose to 14.1 percent, partially explained by higher world oil prices.
The current account deficit widened to 4.7 percent of GDP in 2005. Strong export
growth, particularly of electronics and tourism services, partially offset higher imports
of oil and capital goods. Robust private capital inflows, including a surge in foreign
direct investment, led to a substantial accumulation of net international reserves.
Unemployment remained constant at 6.6 percent.
In 2006, economic activity has remained strong, supported by large foreign direct
investment, improved domestic business confidence, and robust domestic
consumption. Inflation is declining, albeit at a low pace. Early economic indicators
suggest, for the year as a whole, real GDP growth could reach at least 6½ percent,
while inflation would be between 11 and 12 percent at the end of the year.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director,
as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary
is transmitted to the country's authorities.

-2-

The overall public sector deficit declined to 3 percent of GDP in 2005, the lowest
figure in a decade, owing to improvements in tax and customs administration and
expenditure restraint. In parallel, the primary surplus reached a record level of
2.1 percent of GDP and public debt fell to about 52 percent of GDP, still a high level.
The central government deficit fell further in the first half of 2006, thanks to buoyant
tax receipts and continued capital spending restraint.
Monetary aggregates are expanding rapidly. Currency issue and broad money grew
at annual rates of 22 and 20 percent in the year to July 2006, while bank credit to the
private sector expanded at a rate of 28 percent. Key contributing factors were the
central bank’s large operational deficit, sizeable accumulation of reserves, improved
consumer confidence, and a rise in investment demand.
On October 17, the central bank replaced the long-standing crawling peg exchange
rate regime with a crawling band. The band is defined in terms of colones per U.S.
dollar, and has an initial width of 3 percent. It will widen over time, as its floor and
ceiling are set to crawl upward, at initial rates of around 3 and 6½ percent per year,
respectively.
The health of the financial sector has improved on the back of a favorable
macroeconomic environment, though important vulnerabilities remain. Bank
profitability reached record levels, in both public and private banks. Reported asset
quality indicators have improved markedly, with nonperforming loans falling down to
1.5 percent of all loans. Although the banking sector remains dominated by public
banks, recent acquisitions of large private banks by multi-national foreign banks
have intensified the process of consolidation and ownership concentration in the
sector. Vulnerabilities include high dollarization of assets and liabilities, and large
offshore banking activities.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors welcomed Costa Rica’s continued strong economic performance,
with GDP growth underpinned by robust exports as well as a substantial
acceleration in private investment. Private capital inflows, including foreign direct
investment, have boosted international reserves, while the fiscal deficit has declined,
with an attendant reduction in public debt. Directors noted, however, that the
economy continues to face important vulnerabilities, including double-digit inflation,
still high public debt, and financial dollarization.

-3-

Directors shared the Costa Rican authorities’ analysis of the main challenges facing
the economy, and commended them for their commitment to a broad reform agenda,
including a comprehensive fiscal reform, greater exchange rate flexibility,
recapitalization of the central bank, and strengthening of financial regulations and
supervision. Implementation of these policies will go a long way toward laying the
foundation for faster growth and poverty reduction.
Directors noted that the near-term outlook for the Costa Rican economy remains
favorable, with growth expected to stay high and inflation to decline.
They considered the risks to the outlook as broadly balanced, while noting the need
to deliver on the proposed reform agenda to maintain consumer and business
confidence.
Directors emphasized that adoption of a broad tax reform is critical to reduce public
debt; allow higher spending on education, infrastructure, and social needs; and
provide the needed support to monetary policy to reduce inflation. They endorsed
the authorities’ efforts to obtain prompt legislative approval of the proposed tax
reform. Directors encouraged the authorities to focus the reform on the VAT and the
income tax, and advised against introducing a financial transactions tax. Directors
underscored the need to complement this reform with measures to further
strengthen tax administration and reduce public expenditure rigidities.
Directors praised the authorities for maintaining a prudent fiscal stance in 2006.
While they recognized the need to increase spending in priority areas, they urged
the authorities to limit expenditure growth until the benefits of the tax reform
materialize. Directors observed that tax revenue projections in the draft 2007 budget
appear ambitious, and recommended prudence in budget execution to ensure that
the fiscal targets are reached.
Directors endorsed the authorities’ recent move from the long-standing crawling peg
to a crawling band regime. They welcomed the decision to allow for a gradual
widening of the band, which will allow market participants to adjust progressively to
an environment with greater exchange rate flexibility. The change in exchange
regime should gradually enhance the autonomy of monetary policy, help anchor
price expectations on target inflation, and enhance the economy’s resilience to
shocks. Directors generally saw this transition as a first step toward the eventual
adoption of an inflation target as a nominal anchor. Several Directors emphasized
the importance of the appropriate conditions being in place before such a move.

-4-

Directors supported the planned recapitalization of the central bank, which they
considered would be an essential complement to a prudent fiscal stance and greater
exchange rate flexibility in order to bring inflation gradually down to low-single digits.
Directors observed that the health of the financial sector has improved in recent
years. To address the remaining vulnerabilities, Directors urged the authorities to
accelerate and broaden financial sector reform, including by strengthening the
supervision of offshore banking activities. They also recommended that the
supervisory authority continue to enhance the monitoring of banks’ asset quality and
foreign currency lending to non foreign-currency earners.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ determination to press ahead with ratification
and implementation of CAFTA-DR. They observed that further trade liberalization,
together with a reduction in the regulatory costs of doing business, should add to
Costa Rica’s growth potential through higher foreign direct investment and trade
opportunities.
Directors encouraged the authorities to continue their efforts to foster regional
cooperation. In particular, they urged continued efforts to reach consensus on a
code of conduct in tax incentives for investment, in order to help forestall harmful tax
competition in the region.
