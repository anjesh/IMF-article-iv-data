IMF Executive Board Completes the First Review Under the Extended Credit Facility
Arrangement for the Kyrgyz Republic and Approves US$13.2 Million Disbursement
On December 4, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) completed
the first review of the Kyrgyz Republic’s economic performance under the three-year
arrangement under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF). The Board’s approval enables the
immediate disbursement of SDR 9.5 million (about US$13.2 million). This would bring total
disbursements under the arrangement to SDR 19 million (about US$26.4 million). The extended
arrangement for SDR 66.6 million (then about US$92.4 million) was approved on April 8, 2015
(see Press Release No. 15/165).
Following the Executive Board discussion Mr. Min Zhu, Deputy Managing Director and Acting
Chair, made the following statement:
“The Kyrgyz authorities have managed successfully to keep the program largely on track despite
that the economy continues to face adverse external and domestic shocks. The economic
slowdown, currency depreciations in the region, and falling gold prices and remittances have
reduced economic growth, worsened external and fiscal balances, and weakened debt
sustainability. Budgetary slippages linked to the October elections have also weakened the fiscal
situation.
“The authorities’ commitment to resume fiscal consolidation starting in 2016 is welcome, and
will help rebuild buffers and keep debt on a sustainable path. Tax revenues are expected to
increase supported by a set of new measures aimed at expanding the tax base and strengthening
tax administration. Current expenditures should decline as spending on goods and services and
other nonpriority outlays will be streamlined. Additionally, the public investment program will
be rephased and prioritized.
“Monetary policy will remain on a tightening bias to contain inflation pressures. The central
bank will also continue to pursue a flexible exchange rate policy to safeguard foreign exchange
reserves and preserve competitiveness, with interventions limited to smoothing short-term
fluctuations.

2
“Maintaining a healthy banking sector is critical in the current environment. Banking supervision
will be strengthened, and the banking law needs to be enacted as a matter of priority to
strengthen the independence of the central bank and ensure a robust bank resolution
mechanism.”

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
AND FIRST REVIEW UNDER THE THREE-YEAR
ARRANGEMENT UNDER THE EXTENDED CREDIT FACILITY,
AND REQUEST FOR MODIFICATION OF PERFORMANCE
CRITERIA

KEY ISSUES
Context. The economy has shown some resilience in the face of adverse regional shocks
but potential growth is constrained by persistent structural challenges, particularly
lagging productivity and dependence on gold, remittances, and foreign aid. Satisfactory
performance under the program during the first half of the year was followed by fiscal
slippages in the run-up to the October elections and a delay in adopting the Banking
Code, a key measure to strengthen central bank independence and the bank resolution
framework. The combined impact of a large public investment program and currency
depreciation has raised the public debt ratio markedly. Significant further depreciation
could pose risks for the otherwise well capitalized, but highly dollarized, financial sector.
The business environment remains weak, overshadowed by lingering disagreements
between the authorities and the largest foreign investor.
Article IV discussions. Since the last 2013 Article IV consultation, counter-cyclical fiscal
and monetary measures and a relatively flexible exchange rate regime helped mitigate
some of the impact of the external shocks on the economy. Discussions focused on
policy reforms needed to: improve resilience and increase medium-term growth
potential and inclusiveness; rebuild fiscal buffers; strengthen the financial sector to
make it an engine of growth; and improve the business climate. This would require:
(i) a credible medium-term fiscal strategy that would maintain debt at sustainable levels;
(ii) continued exchange rate flexibility to help the economy absorb external shocks;
(iii) bolstering financial sector resilience to limit adverse spillovers back to the real sector;
and (iv) bold structural reforms to ensure inclusive growth and reduced inequality.
Program discussions. The program is broadly on track. All end-June quantitative
performance criteria (QPCs) and indicative targets (ITs) were met. All but two structural
benchmarks (SBs) were met. The authorities are committed to resuming fiscal

KYRGYZ REPUBLIC

consolidation in 2016, to offset the 2015 fiscal slippages and to keep debt on a
sustainable path. Furthermore, they agreed to implement a set of compensatory
measures to ensure the stability of the financial sector until the banking law is passed.
The authorities are requesting the modification of performance criteria and that the
second disbursement (SDR 9.514 million) is available upon completion of this review.

CONTEXT
1.
Despite significant reform efforts over the past two decades, persistent structural
weaknesses limit potential growth. Dependence on gold, remittances, and foreign aid leaves the
economy vulnerable to external shocks and makes it difficult to generate broad-based prosperity. As
productivity lags, growth continues to rely on large-scale capital spending and an abundant supply
of labor. The link between credit expansion and economic growth is weak as the financial sector is
still underdeveloped. Despite progress in improving infrastructure and energy reliability, significant
gaps remain. Poverty is high, with large differences in development across regions. Still nascent
institutions, frequent changes in government, and a challenging business environment further
hamper economic development.
2.
Since the last Article IV consultation in 2013, economic performance has suffered
owing to a series of external shocks. After picking up in 2013, nongold growth decelerated
markedly in 2014–15. The economic slowdown and currency devaluations in the region (especially
Russia), falling gold prices and remittances, and uncertainties and delays surrounding accession to
the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU) worsened external and fiscal balances and dampened domestic
demand. The som depreciated in response to the worsening external balance and increased
uncertainty, losing almost half of its value against the dollar between June 2013 and October 2015.
Inflation inched up, due mainly to som depreciation. Fiscal buffers were reduced by countercyclical
fiscal policies and a large foreign-financed public investment program. Foreign reserves declined
somewhat due to foreign exchange interventions by the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic
(NBKR). The financial sector is stable but in the context of high dollarization vulnerable to further
significant currency depreciation and a slowdown in economic activity.

3.
Large-scale foreign-financed public investment in combination with sharp currency
depreciation is weakening debt sustainability. The country remains at a moderate risk of debt
distress, but planned infrastructure investments in excess of 20 percent of GDP over the next
three years and the 16 percent depreciation of the national currency so far this year have raised
public debt by 6 percentage points of GDP, bringing it close to the high risk of debt distress level.
While infrastructure gaps remain large, investment at such a scale raises concerns over efficiency
and absorptive capacity. Debt risks are exacerbated by stagnating revenues and elevated spending
on wages, subsidies, and goods and services.
4.
Despite strong credit growth over the past three years, financial sector remains
underdeveloped and is subject to vulnerabilities. While financial inclusion improved, banks’
penetration in remote areas is still narrow. The limited array of financial products and instruments
reduces the opportunity for domestically-financed investments. Moreover, the system is still largely
cash based, and highly dollarized. A further decline in economic activity coupled with significant
currency depreciation could raise both direct balance sheet risks and indirect credit risks by
undermining borrowers’ creditworthiness.
5.
Structural reforms to make the economy more competitive are necessary to maximize
the benefits from accession to the EEU. The Kyrgyz Republic became a member of the EEU in
August 2015. The country will receive 1.9 percent of the common customs pool, which should result
in an increase in customs revenues of about 1.5 percentage points of GDP annually. Beyond higher
customs revenue, expected benefits from EEU membership stem from improved access to a large
market for goods, services, and labor. Structural reforms aimed at raising productivity and
diversifying the economy are necessary for the full benefits of integration to be captured
(SIP “Impact of the accession to the EEU”).
6.
Implementation of past Fund policy advice has been mixed. Several of the
2013 Article IV consultation recommendations were implemented, with policy traction particularly in
the monetary area. The authorities have also been implementing key recommendations from
the 2013 FSAP Update (Annex II), and there has been close cooperation through Fund technical

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KYRGYZ REPUBLIC

assistance. However, fiscal policy has been looser than recommended, public debt has increased
sharply, and further progress is needed in the financial sector (Annex I).
7.
The current Extended Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement, approved last April by the
Board, is in line with the authorities’ 2013–17 National Strategy for Sustainable Development.
It focuses on generating inclusive growth through reducing macroeconomic vulnerabilities,
achieving fiscal sustainability, supporting banking sector reforms, strengthening debt management,
and encouraging structural reforms to expand the economy’s potential. Achieving these objectives
requires fiscal consolidation, and prioritization of public investment to maintain debt at sustainable
level. In addition, continuing to ensure greater exchange rate flexibility is needed to preserve the
economy’s competitiveness. Also, strengthening the resilience of the banking sector by stepping up
supervision and adopting the Banking Law will be critical. Speeding up PFM and AML/CFT reforms
will be important to improve the business environment.
8.
Political uncertainty could weaken the reform momentum. Following the parliamentary
elections in October, a new four-party government was formed, with Prime Minister Sariev retaining
his post. With local and presidential elections scheduled for 2016 and 2017, respectively, a
slowdown in the reform momentum could further weaken economic prospects.

Inflation through end-September was moderate. After an initial spike due to the som
depreciation in the first quarter of the year, inflation subsided to 6.4 percent by end-September, as a
result of a decline in food prices. However, core inflation remains high at 8.6 percent, driven by the
pass-through effect from som depreciation.

11.
Fiscal performance for the first nine months of the year was better than expected. The
overall fiscal deficit reached 0.2 percent of GDP compared to 5 percent under the program, as a
result of the postponement of the bulk of the goods and services to the last quarter, and delays in
parliamentary ratification of some PIPs (charts below). Revenues excluding grants exceeded
projections by 2.9 percentage points of GDP, mainly due to the sale of a mining license
(1.4 percentage points of GDP) and NBKR dividends (1.2 percentage points of GDP). Government
expenditures were lower (3.6 percentage points of GDP), mainly due to underspending on goods
and services and delays in the public investment program (PIP) implementation. As a result of the
latter, external debt was lower than projected.

The external position deteriorated largely due to the slowdown among major trading
partners and falling gold prices. The real effective exchange rate appreciated over the past year,
reflecting the ruble and tenge depreciation as well as the sharp appreciation of the U.S. dollar.
Slowing external demand and delays in PIP execution resulted in nongold exports and imports
dropping by 26 percent and 17 percent year-on-year, respectively over the first seven months.
End-September remittances fell by 28 percent year-on-year.

The banking sector is well capitalized and generally sound, but slowing lending
activity, growing dollarization and an up-tick in NPL’s and restructured loans raise concerns
(Table 8). Banks’ average capital adequacy stood at 21.5 percent, well above the 12 percent
minimum requirement, following the implementation by all banks of the NBKR mandated capital
increase in July (SB). Excluding FINCA—a large microfinance institution which obtained a banking
license in March—credit to the private sector grew by 18.8 percent as of September (year-on-year).
Loan dollarization dropped to 53 percent, driven by the som volatility and the recently introduced
macro-prudential measures. On the other hand, deposit dollarization rose to 67 percent.
Nonperforming loans (NPLs) and restructured loans1 increased, mostly driven by the deterioration in
the quality of foreign currency denominated loans to the construction sector. The effects of the

The Russia-Kyrgyz Development Fund (RKDF) commenced operations with an
on-lending arrangement through two state-owned banks. The RKDF was setup as an
international organization with a statutory capital of US$500 million; it has so far received
US$300 million from Russia. The remaining balance should be received in 2016. The RKDF’s activities
will be exempt from taxes and customs duties. Rather than directly lending to a large number of
SMEs, the fund recently entered into a US$20 million onlending arrangement with two large
state-owned banks. The RKDF is also considering a number of larger projects for direct lending.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
16.
The near-term outlook remains weak, but if appropriate policies are implemented, the
medium-term prospects should improve. Growth in 2015 is expected to reach 2.5 percent due to
lower gold production and weaker external demand. It should gradually recover starting 2016,

food and fuel prices and prudent monetary policy. Over the medium term, the fiscal deficit is
expected to gradually decline as a result of consolidation efforts. The current account deficit is also
expected to narrow as remittances recover and public investment moderates. Despite
under-execution of PIPs, public debt will surge over the medium term driven mainly by a weaker
som, but then should gradually decline.
17.
Risks are tilted to the downside. Key near-term risks continue to stem from developments
in Russia, Kazakhstan, and China, and gold prices. Additional investment projects or a large som
depreciation could tilt debt into a high risk of distress. Protracted discussions between the
government and the gold company Centerra on the Kumtor mine are making the business
environment more uncertain. If the dispute remains unresolved, gold production could fall
by 20 percent starting 2017. The combination of rapid credit growth, high dollarization, and further
significant som deprecation, could undermine the financial sector health. Expansionary policies in
the run-up to the 2016 and 2017 elections would weaken the reform momentum. Upside risks
include the strengthening of economic ties with China (despite China’s gradual economic
slowdown), benefits from EEU accession and investments supported by the newly established
Russia-Kyrgyz Development Fund (Annex III, RAM).
18.
The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s views on the outlook and risks. Their
near-term growth projections are more optimistic but they converge with staff forecast for outer
years. Their outlook is based on a more favorable assessment of regional economic dynamics and
the growth-enhancing potential of the ongoing public investment program. While acknowledging
that their debt position has recently deteriorated, they nevertheless highlighted their need for
closing the existing infrastructure gap, and stressed that the growth dividends from these
investments will help bring down debt to more sustainable levels. They also shared staff’s views on
the risks facing the financial sector.

PROGRAM ISSUES
19.
Despite the mixed economic picture, program conditionality has so far been broadly
met. All end-June PCs and ITs were met and all SBs but two were met (Table 12). The amendments
to the tax code were submitted in August, instead of June. The Ministry of Finance (MoF) developed
a medium-term debt strategy (MTDS) and the State Tax Service (STS) was reorganized. The NBKR
issued in March the decision to unify the capital requirements in three stages, and all banks have
met the first step. The NBKR submitted amendments to the administrative responsibility code to
increase penalties for illegal foreign exchange bureau operations, but they were rejected by
parliament last June. The audit of Debt Resolution Agency (DEBRA) was not finalized on time, but
the authorities are making good progress toward this and the remaining SBs. The safeguard
assessment of the NBKR was completed in October. Parliament passed the first reading of the
Banking Code in June, but downgraded it to a law. Given that parliament did not reconvene in
September ahead of the October elections, the new parliament will, at its discretion, either continue
with the second and third readings or restart the process.

A. Resuming fiscal consolidation is critical…
The program fiscal strategy based on resuming consolidation in 2016, following a pause in 2015,
remains valid. However, due to election-related fiscal slippages and a spike in external debt, additional
but more evenly phased consolidation efforts are needed over the next three years. The authorities
remain committed to the consolidation effort envisaged under the program to meet the 2016 targets
as well as the medium-term adjustment path.
20.
Due to unbudgeted election-related spending, mostly taking effect in the last quarter,
the fiscal deficit is expected to widen this year. The overall deficit is expected to reach
3.5 percent of GDP compared to 2.5 percent under the program. The increase is the result of
pre-election spending and commitments made in the run-up to the October parliamentary
elections, mainly a large increase in teachers’ wages (with an annual cost of 1.4 percent of GDP),
election-related spending including biometric equipment, and school infrastructure. The authorities
had argued initially for a deficit of 4.5 percent of GDP, but agreed with staff to contain some
nonpriority expenditures, especially on goods and services, to reduce their deficit target by
one percentage point of GDP. The deficit will be financed primarily from concessional PIP borrowing
and program grants.
21.
Revenues are expected to exceed projections. Tax revenues, are expected to
under-perform by 0.8 percentage points due to three factors: (i) a larger than expected drop in
imports (-18.8 percent); (ii) a shift of VAT collection, following EEU accession, from the customs
services where VAT is paid at the borders, to the state tax services (STS) where the VAT is paid on
the basis of self assessment after the goods have entered the country; and (iii) a three-month delay
in EEU accession, August instead of May. Nontax revenues will, however, perform better than

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KYRGYZ REPUBLIC

expected by 3.4 percentage points of GDP, mainly due to the sale of the Geroi mine license and
higher NBKR profits.
22.
Expenditures on the other hand are expected to exceed the program target by
1.9 percentage points of GDP. Current expenditures will exceed the end-year target
(+1.7 percentage point of GDP), driven by a higher wage bill due to the increase in teachers’ salaries
and unbudgeted spending commitments on goods and services. The latter will be contained at
about 8.5 percent of GDP instead of 9.3 percent as originally planned. Domestically-financed capital
expenditures, driven by electoral promises, are also expected to contribute to the spending excess
(+1.6 percentage point of GDP). On the other hand, foreign-financed capital expenditures are
expected to under-perform (-1.4 percentage points of GDP) due to the authorities’ decision to delay
some of the PIPs.

Fiscal consolidation should resume in 2016, underpinned by strong ownership. The
authorities’ 2016 draft budget submitted to parliament is expansionary with a deficit of 5.5 percent
of GDP, driven by the large PIP program initiated in 2014. Nevertheless, given the recent spike in
debt, they agreed with staff to revisit it with the intention of targeting a deficit of 4.5 percent of

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

KYRGYZ REPUBLIC

GDP, which includes an adjustment equivalent to 1.6 percentage points of GDP―0.3 percentage
points of GDP on the revenue side and 1.3 percentage points on the expenditure side. As a result,
the primary balance (excluding foreign financed PIPs) is expected to improve from 3 percent of GDP
in 2015 to 4 percent of GDP in 2016. Moreover, tax revenues are expected to substantially increase,
largely driven by higher customs revenue following EEU accession. In this context, any future
windfall or revenue over-performance would present an opportunity to consider accelerating
consolidation. Despite a small increase in the wage bill, current expenditures will drop as a result of
a reduction in goods and services and the streamlining of social benefits through better targeting.
24.
To meet their 2016 fiscal target, staff and the authorities agreed on the following set
of measures:
x

On the revenue side: (i) strengthening the VAT administration and streamlining exemptions;
(ii) refraining from extending expiring exemptions or granting new ones; (iii) raising excise tax
rates on alcohol and tobacco products; (iv) introducing stamps for domestically produced
goods; and (v) introducing luxury tax for large real estate. These measures could yield an
additional 1.5 percentage point of GDP (LOI, ¶13).

x

On the expenditure side: (i) refraining from ad hoc wage increases and preparing, with the help
of IMF TA, an action plan to gradually reduce the wage bill to about 8 percent of GDP by 2018;
(ii) streamlining goods and services and maintaining them to their 2015 nominal level;
(iii) undertaking a review of subsidies with the objective of streamlining them and improving
their targeting; (iv) reviewing electricity tariffs to ensure the sustainability of the sector;
(v) improving the targeting of social benefits to avoid duplication; and (vi) keeping domestically
financed capital spending below 3 percent of GDP.

25.
Tax administration will be strengthened through a restructuring of functions towards
improving efficiency. The STS, which proved to be the most efficient collecting agency, was tasked
with additional responsibilities to improve tax administration. The STS, which was tasked with VAT
collection on imports following EEU accession, will also undertake a pilot test in two districts to
collect social contributions. If successful, the STS will retain permanently the collection of these
contributions by the end of 2016 (LOI, ¶15).
26.
To ensure that debt will return to sustainable levels, fiscal consolidation should
continue during 2017–18. To offset the 2015 fiscal slippages and address the weaker debt outlook,
staff and the authorities agreed on a realistic, but overall more aggressive, consolidation path than
the one envisaged at the time of the program request totaling 3 percentage points of GDP in
2017–18. Tax revenues will be expected to increase by 0.5 percentage point of GDP, as a result of
the authorities’ efforts to widen the tax base, especially through streamlining tax exemptions.
Expenditure will be marked by a reduction of the wage bill by about 1.5 percentage points of GDP
and continued streamlining of goods and services. Medium-term consolidation measures should be
underpinned by structural reforms, which will be monitored through SBs.

B. …to maintain debt at sustainable levels
27.
Fiscal expansion, in combination with currency depreciation, would undermine debt
sustainability. Taking into account the recent currency depreciation, public debt would have surged
to 76 percent of GDP by 2018 under the authorities’ initial borrowing plans. Staff argued that
the benefits from public investment to relieve infrastructure bottlenecks and increase growth
potential should be weighed against the impact on debt sustainability, particularly in the context of
stagnating revenues and rising current expenditures. The authorities agreed to revise their plans by
rephasing the PIP program, which would result in debt peaking at about 68 percent of GDP by 2017,
before dropping below 65 percent of GDP by 2020 (Text Table 4). However, despite the authorities’
commitment, downside risks and vulnerabilities regarding debt sustainability remain high.

28.
For debt to remain at a moderate risk of debt distress, new borrowing needs to be
limited. Under the DSA, external debt in present value (PV) term is estimated at 35 percent of GDP
and remittances. Additional sizable borrowing or further significant currency depreciation could tilt
debt to the high risk of debt distress (Annex IV). Staff and the authorities agreed that prudence
should be exercised when contracting and guaranteeing new debt (Table 7). They also agreed that a
primary balance of about 2 percent of GDP by 2018 would be needed to keep public debt at
sustainable levels. Given elevated debt vulnerabilities and a DSA on the verge of tipping into a high

15

risk of debt distress, staff agreed to the authorities’ request to monitor nonconcessional borrowing
through an indicative target, in addition to a QPC on new debt contracted.

C. Monetary policy should remain on a tightening bias
Monetary policy is focused on containing inflationary and exchange rate pressures, but is facing
difficult trade-offs between allowing exchange rate flexibility and preserving financial sector stability in
the context of high dollarization, on one hand, and maintaining tight liquidity to contain inflationary
and exchange rate pressures and allowing enough room for private sector credit growth, on the other
hand.
29.
The NBKR will continue to contain inflation within the 5–7 percent range. Despite
significant currency depreciation, the NBKR has succeeded in keeping inflation in single digits. Going
forward, staff and the NBKR agreed on pursuing a monetary stance with a tightening bias. This
would require maintaining the policy rate

30.
The NBKR and staff agreed on the need to enhance monetary policy traction. While the
NBKR agreed that reducing dollarization and cash in circulation are necessary to improve the
traction of monetary policy, they acknowledged that this will take time and require a comprehensive
and balanced set of monetary, exchange rate, and de-dollarization policies. To this end, the NBKR
will: (i) keep liquidity tight at a level that provides incentive for interbank trading; (ii) continue with
macro-prudential policies aimed at making dollar assets and liabilities more expensive than som
ones; (iii) allow the NBKR bills to be used as collateral for the NBKR’s borrowing facility as well as in
the interbank market; and (iv) further improve the NBKR’s communication about economic
prospects and the monetary policy stance (LOI, ¶18). In addition, the NBKR will strive to narrow the
corridor around the policy rate and make it symmetric, by setting a level for overnight deposit and
lending rates closer to the policy rate.
31.
Greater exchange rate flexibility is necessary to reduce external imbalances and
safeguarding foreign exchange reserves. The NBKR’s policy of allowing the exchange rate to react
to external shocks helped protect both reserves and competitiveness. Going forward, the NBKR and
staff agreed to continue with this approach. There was also agreement on the need to monitor the

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KYRGYZ REPUBLIC

tightening effect of foreign exchange interventions to avoid stifling credit and by extension
economic activity. In addition, given the large number of illegal foreign exchange bureaus and their
role in exacerbating volatility in the foreign exchange market,2 the NBKR agreed to resubmit to
Parliament the amendments to the administrative responsibility code (SB, February 2016).
32.
The recently completed safeguards assessment of the NBKR concluded that the
continued absence of a revised legal framework remains a key vulnerability. The assessment
reiterated significant weaknesses in the: (i) legal structure, particularly in governance arrangements;
(ii) the audit committee, whose authority remains limited, as it only has an advisory role vis-à-vis the
NBKR’s Board; and (iii) the accountability mechanisms, including the external and internal audits. The
authorities agreed to address these issues through the adoption of the banking law.

D. Financial sector reforms should be put on a fast track
33.
While the banking sector has weathered the crisis so far, nonetheless, it remains
vulnerable to exchange rate depreciation and sectoral concentration. Standard FSIs suggests a
stable banking sector. However, stress tests regularly conducted by the NBKR suggest that banks,
while resilient, are vulnerable to risks stemming from exchange rate depreciation and sectoral
concentration, especially in trade and construction (Box 1). However, large exposures are not yet an
issue; in particular, the five largest borrowers account for 56 percent of total banks’ equity and
80 percent for the five largest banks’ equity. Moreover, cross-border contagion risks are not
significant due to limited integration in the international financial system.3 Additional risks could
emerge from the valuation of collateral as real-estate prices are declining as well as from maturity
mismatch.
34.
The NBKR is taking appropriate measures to mitigate financial sector systemic risks
and vulnerabilities. The recently enacted macro-prudential measures—higher provisions for
foreign currency loans and debt-to-income ratio for all consumer loans—helped contain foreign
currency credit growth. However, depreciation expectations have also contributed to curtailing the
demand for these loans. In addition, the NBKR has recently instructed banks to: (i) increase general
liquidity and instant ratios;4 (ii) introduce liquidity coverage ratios for large banks; (iii) introduce
“capital buffers” requiring banks to increase their CAR to 18 percent and to 20 percent for large
banks;5 and (iv) increase loan-loss provisioning. These capital buffers and increased loan-loss
provisioning will help banks to better weather direct and indirect risks stemming from exchange rate
volatility. The NBKR already introduced differentiated reserve requirement for som and foreign
denominated deposits. It also indicated to staff that it stands ready to strengthen existing, or

introduce new, macro prudential measures as needs arise (LOI, ¶22), including to address sectoral
concentration risks . Moreover, improving the banking resolution framework, a key objective of the
Banking Law, is critical for ensuring financial sector stability.
35.
The NBKR is committed to implementing some outstanding FSAP recommendations,
to strengthen the financial sector (Annex II). In particular, with the help of the new IMF resident
advisor, who started in November, the NBKR will develop a strategic plan to enhance banking
supervision. This plan will: (i) provide a roadmap for transition to risk based supervision; (ii) prepare
a clear program for supervisory activities; and (iii) increase staffs’ capacity through training. At the
same time, the NBKR will work with MoF and the Deposit Protection Agency (DPA) to conduct crisis
simulation exercises (LOI, ¶22). The NBKR agreed that maintaining prudent lending standards and
risk management practices is instrumental for preserving financial sector stability during the phase
of strong credit growth and financial deepening.
36.
Progress on banking sector reform is mixed. The banking law continues to linger in
parliament. It will take the new parliament some time to familiarize itself with the draft law and go
through the mandatory readings. The authorities are committed to ensure the enactment and
publication in the Official Gazette of the Banking Law and the related “Law on Enacting the Banking
Law” in a form substantially similar to the draft Banking Code submitted to parliament in
September 2013 (SB, September 2016). In the interim, staff and the authorities agreed to implement
compensatory measures to preserve the stability of the banking sector, including: (i) starting the
process of liquidation for the two banks that are under NBKR’s conservatorship;6 (ii) appointing an
auditor (prior action) and completing the audit of DEBRA by March 2016 (LOI, ¶24)—this will pave
the way for completing the liquidation process and winding down DEBRA’s assets; (iii) developing a
crises preparedness framework (SB, September 2016); and (iv) preparing a strategic plan for
supervision.
Box 1. The NBKR’s Stress Test
The NBKR conducts stress tests on a monthly basis, based on the Cihak stress test model. It measures risks
to the system stemming mainly from credit, direct and indirect foreign exchange risk, interest rate, specific
sector trends and liquidity. The NBKR also conducts a multifactor stress tests, as well as liquidity and reverse
stress testing.
Credit risk stress test assesses the impact of deterioration in total loan portfolio or particular sectors on
CAR. In particular, three types of stress tests are conducted, namely: (i) downgrading of all loans by one or
two categories; (ii) a combination of downgrading all classified loans by one category, as well as partial
downgrade of performing loans; and (iii) individual or combined sectoral shocks. The outcome of this stress
test suggests that some banks are sensitive to these shocks.
Exchange rate stress test assesses the direct risk of a 30 percent depreciation of the som, as well as the
indirect risk, which takes into account the balance sheet effect of the depreciation.
Multifactor stress test assesses the impact on CAR of one category downgrade of all loans, together with

interest rate, and direct and indirect FX risks.
Finally, interest rate shocks do not have major impact on banks’ profitability. Liquidity and reverse stress
testing are also regularly conducted, but data are confidential. In addition, the NBKR also carries out
macroeconomic stress testing, but the model specification and modeling techniques need to be refined.

E. Structural reforms
Structural reforms under the program aim at implementing PFM reforms to improve public sector
efficiency and accountability and help restore fiscal buffers; implementing AML/CFT reforms and
procurement laws in order to boost anticorruption efforts; and putting the energy sector on a
sustainable commercial footing to reduce its fiscal footprint and improve access.
37.
PFM reforms will improve public sector efficiency and accountability and rebuild fiscal
buffers. Staff and the authorities agreed on the need to continue to press ahead with PFM reforms
(LOI, ¶29). The Memorandum of Co-operation with TIKA, the Turkish Cooperation and Coordination
Agency to finance the new FMIS will be signed in the second quarter of 2016 (SB, June 2016). The
authorities will work on developing a methodological framework for assessing budget risks, with
IMF TA. The authorities remain committed to making every effort to ensure the enactment by
parliament of a budget code in line with IMF and World Bank advice.
38.
The adoption of an AML/CFT and procurement laws will boost anticorruption efforts.
In this context, staff and the authorities agreed on the need to strengthen and implement an
AML/CFT regime in line with international standards. The outgoing parliament rejected the previous
AML/CFT law, but the authorities agreed to submit a new draft that reflects all the recommendations
provided by the Fund to the new parliament by next April 2016 (LOI, ¶25). Staff and the authorities
agreed that timely action through the adoption and publication of the law should contribute to a
positive Eurasian Group on Combating Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism assessment
in 2016.
39.
Putting the energy sector on a financially sustainable footing would not only reduce
the sector’s fiscal burden but would improve the business environment by facilitating access.
Energy sector reforms should aim at improving service delivery and putting it on sound economic
footing. In this context staff and the authorities in consultation with the World Bank agreed to:
(i) review the regulatory framework to clarify roles and responsibilities; (ii) enhance policy planning
and management and establish a national power clearance center to improve coordination among
the various actors; (iii) work to improve internal controls, introduce management information
systems at power companies and roll out smart power usage meters; and (iv) review the
methodology for setting power tariffs to ensure economic soundness and adjust accordingly the
roadmap for increasing tariffs and developing targeting social protections.
40.
Proper use of the RKDF’s funds would help expand the economy’s growth prospects.
This would require that the RKDF operates in line with market-based, good governance, and
transparency principles. Staff underscored the following: (i) the RKDF lending operations should not

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

KYRGYZ REPUBLIC

distort market operations; (ii) subsidized lending schemes should be transparent and should not
hamper banking sector operations; and (iii) RKDF programs should be open to all banks, and not
only to state-owned banks. The authorities concurred with staff recommendations. They also
pointed out that the RKDF is expected to facilitate financial deepening by financing large projects
which banks cannot finance.

F. Program modalities
41.
Program design and modification of performance criteria. Revised QPCs for
December 2015 and new QPCs for March, June, September and December 2016 ,on the floor on
NIR, ceiling on NDA, and ceiling on cumulative over deficit of the general government and ITs on
ceiling on reserve money and cumulative state government tax collections, are proposed
(LOI, Table 1). Additionally, in line with the new debt limit policy, the QPC on present value of debt
will replace the one on nonconcessional borrowing. At the request of the authorities, the latter will
be maintained as an IT.
42.
The program will continue to be monitored on a semi-annual basis. The second review
will be based on continuous and end-December 2015 QPCs and the third review on continuous and
end-June 2016 QPCs. Structural conditionality will focus on macro-critical areas, particularly in the
financial sector to ensure its stability and on streamlining public spending in support of fiscal
consolidation.
43.
Financing needs for the remainder of this and next year are expected to be fully
covered. Donors and the Fund are expected to cover the balance of payment gap in
2015‒16 (Text Table 5). The capacity to repay the Fund remains adequate (Table 10).

ARTICLE IV DISCUSSIONS: ADDRESSING
MEDIUM-TERM CHALLENGES
The key challenge over the medium term is to raise potential growth and make growth more inclusive.
Dependence on gold, remittances, and foreign aid leaves the economy vulnerable to external shocks.
Sound policies and adequate reforms are needed to improve productivity, rebuild buffers to increase
the economy’s resilience to shocks, and create a stable and well-functioning financial sector.

A. Increasing medium-term growth prospects and inclusiveness
Gold, remittances, and foreign aid accounted for over 40 percent of GDP in 2014. These external
sources generate uneven growth as evidenced by rising disparities especially at the regional level.
External dependence also increases vulnerability to shocks and reduces the government’s scope for
action.
44.
Enhancing potential growth is necessary for
the Kyrgyz Republic to become a dynamic emerging
market economy and to bring living standards closer
to the lower middle income country (MIC) level. The
lack of economic diversification makes the Kyrgyz
economy susceptible to shocks. Overall and nongold
growths have fallen below potential in recent years.
Additionally, the large non-observed economy (NOE) is
depriving public finances of critically needed resources.
Although the GINI coefficient has improved over the
past decade, the relative share of income of the lowest
quintile of the population has declined (SIP, “Income
Inequality in the Kyrgyz Republic”). Despite complex and
costly social protection schemes, only one fifth of those
in the poorest quintile receive social benefits. The
business environment continues to pose significant
challenges as the Kyrgyz Republic lags behind its
neighbors.

Staff and the authorities agreed on the need
to introduce reforms to promote sustainable and broad-based growth. Over the past two
decades growth relied on capital spending and abundant supply of labor, while productivity and
human capital stagnated. This model, together with the country’s dependence on external resources,
produced volatile and anemic growth. In addition, the reliance on remittances has also not
contributed significantly to long-term growth (SIP “Impact of Workers’ Remittances on Kyrgyz
Economic Growth”). The authorities concurred with staff on the need to implement productivity

enhancing reforms and investment in human capital, which are necessary to transition to a new
growth model (Box 2).
46.
The authorities recognized that improving the business climate is essential for
diversifying the economy, improving productivity and maximizing the benefits from EEU
accession. The latest World Bank Doing Business Report highlights persistent challenges in the
areas of ease of trading across borders, the insolvency regime, access to electricity, tax payment, and
contract enforcing, where the Kyrgyz Republic lags behind its’ regional peers. As a result, staff and
the authorities agreed on the need to address these key weaknesses by: (i) reducing the number of
payments and documents needed to pay taxes; (ii) simplifying access to the power grid;
(iii) simplifying the regime for cross-border trade and removing nontariff barriers as well as reducing
procedures and document requirements; (iv) accelerating the process for contract enforcement and
reducing costs; and (v) reducing the time needed to resolve insolvency. A constructive and fair
resolution of the dispute with Centerra is not only essential to prevent disruptions to gold
production but also to create a stable and predictable investment climate.
47.
The authorities acknowledged that improving tax fairness and the ease of paying taxes
are essential to bringing economic activity out of the shadows. The NOE contributes between
24 percent of GDP according to official statistics and 40 percent according to OECD estimates. The
NOE is particularly prevalent in trade, hospitality, transport, and agriculture. While often more
productive, the non-observed economy deprives public finances of an estimated revenue of
6–13 percent of GDP. The authorities agreed with staff that an integrated tax compliance strategy
which balances assistance, encouragement and enforcement is key in formalizing the NOE. Such a
strategy would include: (i) improving the ease of paying taxes and reducing unfairness particularly
through the elimination of exemptions; (ii) improving and expanding the coverage of social safety
net and essential public services; and (iii) carrying out public education campaign aimed at reducing
the tolerance for the NOE.

Economic volatility reflects vulnerabilities
arising from dependence on external
sources. Most shocks to the economy are
either the result of political upheavals or
external developments. Dependence on gold,
remittances, and foreign aid, which accounted
for up to 40 percent of GDP in 2014, amplifies
the impact of such shocks on the economy.

The NOE deprives the budget from valuable resources. Non-observed activity has a negative impact on

Diversifying the economy, increasing productivity, and bringing economic activity out of the shadows
will require significant improvements to the business environment. The latest World Bank Doing
Business Report highlights persistent challenges in across borders trading, resolving insolvency, access to
electricity, paying taxes, and enforcing contract. Reforms aimed at addressing these weaknesses would go a
long way towards correcting structural imbalances and enhancing growth potential.

48.
The authorities concurred with staff on the importance of reducing income inequality
to promote growth inclusiveness. While extreme poverty has declined, overall poverty remains
high compared to regional peers. Extreme poverty, defined by an income of US$1.25 a day, remains
below 5 percent, while about 80 percent of the population still lives below US$5 a day. Poverty is
concentrated in rural areas with pronounced differences in poverty levels across regions and
municipal areas. This has been driven by volatile growth, high population growth, poor
infrastructure, and weak institutions. The authorities agreed that sustainably reducing income
inequality will require: (i) achieving macroeconomic stability; (ii) consolidating public finances to
create more space for targeted social spending; (iii) broadening access to finance; (iv) improving the
business environment; and (v) building human capital by improving education and enhancing
workers’ skills via training programs.

B. Increasing the economy’s resilience to shocks
Deteriorating fiscal and external balances, foreign financed capital spending and a depreciating
currency are eroding already thin buffers and inflating public debt. Compared to the last Article IV
consultation, foreign exchange reserves are ½ month of imports lower and public debt is 20 percent of
GDP higher. The budget continues to be dependent on grants, whereas tax revenues are relatively low
for the region. While a countercyclical fiscal stance was needed in 2014–15, a robust fiscal adjustment
over the medium term is needed to bring the debt ratio to below 65 percent of GDP.
49.
Persistently large current account deficits undermine economic performance and
deplete buffers. The large deficits reflect insufficient national savings relative to investments
supported by sizable official external resources. Based on a range of approaches used by staff, the
som could be considered moderately overvalued by 4–14 percent (Annex V). Staff and the NBKR
agreed that the current policy of allowing the som to fluctuate with market conditions together with
limited foreign exchange interventions to smooth out volatility is appropriate.

50.
Based on the IMF’s reserve adequacy metric (ARA), the foreign exchange reserves
appear slightly insufficient to buffer the economy against shocks. Reserves currently stand at
3½ months of imports, about ½ months of imports lower than at the time of the previous Article IV
consultation. The difference could have been even higher, had imports in 2014–15 not contracted
due to negative spillovers in the region. Staff and the authorities agreed on the need to rebuilt
reserves to around four months of imports, notably taking into account the country’s vulnerability to
shocks and the high level of dollarization.
51.
Maintaining public debt at a sustainable level warrants rebuilding fiscal buffers. The
country is financing its deficit by relying on external debt, grants, and depleting deposits at the
NBKR. Fiscal buffers should be rebuilt by raising sustainable revenues, containing current
expenditures, and borrowing responsibly to address infrastructure gaps (SIP, “Cross Country
Comparison on Tax Revenue and Expenditure”). Raising tax revenues entails improving personal and
corporate income tax by broadening the tax base and reducing the unfairness of the tax system, by
eliminating exemptions and special regimes. Increasing the VAT rate, which is the lowest in the
region, should also be considered. The wage bill is expected to exceed 9 percent of GDP this year
while regional comparator countries average around 6 percent of GDP. Reducing current
expenditure should thus include a reduction in the wage bill in line with the action plan to be
developed as a result of the review of public wages due by April. Additionally, the authorities should
refrain from using one-off revenues for financing permanent expenditures; streamline
nonpriority expenditures; consolidate social benefits to improve the targeting of the existing social
programs, and review subsidies (SB, June 2016).

Rebuilding policy buffers by mobilizing domestic revenues and streamlining
expenditures is essential for financing for development (Box 3). The authorities concurred with
staff’s external stability assessment and reiterated the importance of holding foreign exchange
reserves at an adequate level of about four months of import cover. They also agreed that they
should take steps to enhance tax collection and streamline spending in line with regional peers,
particularly given their considerable development needs. However, they felt that increasing the VAT
rate was not appropriate at this stage.
Box 3. Financing for Development

External debt vulnerability is approaching the
threshold of high risk of distress, strengthening
the case for domestic revenue mobilization and
prioritization of investments. A scale up in
external concessional borrowing or grants is
unlikely since the country has already received
relatively high official development assistance
(Figure 1). Given this constraint, domestic revenue
mobilization would address such financing gap.

Compared to the peers in lower-middle income
tax revenue is feasible. Nontax revenue offers even
more room for improvement (Figures 2 and 3). To
broaden the domestic revenue base, in particular,
the authorities should consider: (i) using a corporate
income tax levied at a competitive rate on a broad
base; (ii) introducing a progressive personal income
tax; and (iii) strengthening real property taxes.

Financing for development should be

complemented by improving the efficiency of
public investment. A substantial increase in domestic revenue mobilization will take time. In light of
potential absorptive capacity constraints, the government should guarantee high-quality spending through
improving project appraisal and enhancing transparency in project selection and procurement with
assistance from the international development partners.

C. Making the financial sector an engine for private sector-led growth
Despite strong credit growth of the past three years, the financial sector remains relatively small,
highly dollarized, and cash-based. Average weighted loan maturity is still under two years, therefore
not providing sufficient support for investment. Developing the financial sector will be critical to
promote growth, and increase financial inclusion. Making financial sector an engine for private
sector-led growth will require addressing existing sensitivities to the exchange rate, pursuing stable
and credible macroeconomic policies aimed at reducing dollarization, and broadening the range of
financial instruments.
53.
Despite strong banking sector growth over the last three years, financial
intermediation remains limited. The banking system is highly dollarized and its assets stand at
around 38 percent of GDP. The economy remains cash-based with weak saving
mobilization―deposits are equivalent to 18 percent of GDP, and are mostly demand deposits.
Credit to GDP stands at 20 percent, well below the region’s average. Financial inclusion remains low
with about 26 percent of the population possessing a bank account. Concentration in the banking
system is not an issue, as five largest banks hold just above half of total deposits and loans.

4.5 (year-on-year) this year, which in turn has resulted in a similar drop in loans to this sector.
55.
The exchange rate appears to explain the nexus between the real and financial sectors.
Given the high dollarization of the banking sector, the exchange rate movements strongly affect the
demand for credit and choice of currency. In addition, the trade and construction sectors, the key
drivers of the economy, are sensitive to exchange rate movements as NPLs in these sectors are
higher and react quickly to changes in the value of the som. The measures outlined in paragraph
34 will help address vulnerabilities stemming from the exchange rate.
56.
Going forward, the feedback between the financial and real sectors is expected to
strengthen. In particular, strong credit growth during previous years is expected to partly offset the
negative regional spillovers on the economy, and support medium-term growth. The Russian-Kyrgyz
Development Fund operations are also expected to provide a push for growth. Potential negative
spillovers from the financial sector to the economy are expected to be limited, given the relatively
small size of the financial sector and the cash-based nature of the economy. Problems in the
financial sector would likely result in withdrawal of deposits from banks, a further increase in

dollarization and slowdown in credit, which could exacerbate exchange rate pressures and hamper
growth prospects.
57.
A credible monetary and exchange rate policy framework, low inflation and deeper
domestic financial markets are essential for the success of any de-dollarization policy. While
the NBKR has successfully established a new monetary policy framework, it should continue to
increase its traction by addressing the key impediments for monetary policy transmission and to
pursue a flexible exchange rate policy. This, together with a prudent fiscal policy, will lay the ground
for a stable macroeconomic environment. The NBKR’s macro-prudential policies are a step in a right
direction. Implementing market-driven and gradual dedollarization policies will build trust in the
financial market. Staff and the authorities agreed that nonmarket based de-dollarization measures
such as forced conversion of foreign currency deposits or suspension of access to foreign currency
deposits, should be avoided.
58.
Developing a market for domestic securities is a first step in deepening domestic
financial markets, and should be carefully coordinated between the MoF and the NBKR. A
deeper market for government securities will encourage interbank activity, where these securities
could be used as collateral. Moreover, hedging instruments, primarily SWAPs, should be developed
to enable clients to protect themselves against risks, in particular exchange rate risks.

STAFF APPRAISAL
59.
Despite significant reform efforts over the past two decades, entrenched structural
challenges stand in the way of achieving sustainable, broad-based growth. Dependence on
gold, remittances, and foreign aid as well as low productivity expose the economy to external shocks
and hold back potential growth. Economic activity continues to rely on unsustainable public
spending. The link between credit growth and the real economy is weak in the context of high
dollarization and informality. Access to energy, transport, and other essential services is hampered
by infrastructure and institutional bottlenecks. Poverty is stubbornly high, especially in
disadvantaged regions. The business climate is clouded by bureaucratic barriers and institutional
weaknesses.
60.
Since the last Article IV consultation in 2013, the economy has been hit by severe
long-lasting external shocks, weakening economic performance and increasing vulnerabilities.
These shocks have taken their toll on the external and fiscal balances as well as domestic demand.
Growth slowed down, inflation inched up, fiscal and to a lesser extent foreign exchange buffers were
depleted. An ambitious foreign financed public investment program and currency depreciation
pushed debt to the brink of high risk of distress. The financial sector benefiting from adequate
capitalization is stable but vulnerabilities are rising in the context of high dollarization and a
weakening som. In light of these increasing vulnerabilities, it is critical that the authorities persevere
with reforms and seize opportunities to rebuild buffers.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

61.
The weaker external environment is likely to last into the medium term and warrants
rebuilding buffers to enhance resilience, strengthening the financial sector as an engine for a
broad-based private sector-led growth and carrying out structural reforms to expand
potential growth. Rolling back debt, replenishing fiscal and foreign exchange buffers is essential to
create space for fiscal and monetary policy and increase the resilience to future shocks.
Strengthening the financial sector is critical to promote growth, and financial inclusion. Reforms
aimed at improving the business climate, diversification, and productivity are preconditions for
sustainable and inclusive growth.
62.
Fiscal consolidation and sound public investment and financing strategies are essential
to bring debt back to sustainable levels and create space for pro-poor and pro-growth
spending. Fiscal slippages in 2015 are regrettable, particularly as windfall revenues were used to
finance permanent expenditures. Nevertheless, the authorities’ commitment to resume fiscal
consolidation in 2016 and accelerate it in 2017–18 is welcome. The commitments need to be backed
up by strong ownership and concrete measures. Tax revenues should increase with efforts aimed at
widening the tax base by removing exemptions, increasing fairness and simplifying tax procedures.
Tax administration should be strengthened through reorganization aimed at improving efficiency.
Fiscal effort should include a reduction of the wage bill and continued streamlining of goods and
services and other nonpriority expenditures. Prudence should be exercised when contracting and
guaranteeing new debt. Public investment projects should be rephased and prioritized to ensure
debt sustainability. Efforts should be stepped up to mobilize domestic sources of financing for
development.
63.
Monetary and exchange rate policies should continue to focus on containing
inflationary and exchange rate pressures, enhancing flexibility and safeguarding foreign
exchange reserves. Monetary policy should remain on a tightening bias, and ready to address
rising inflationary and exchange rate pressures. The NBKR should continue to limit interventions to
smoothing out excessive volatility while allowing the exchange rate to absorb external shocks. The
NBKR should use all available instruments to sterilize the tightening effect of its foreign exchange
interventions so as to avoid stifling economic activity. Implementing market-based de-dollarization
measures will be critical.
64.
Progress on banking sector reforms, particularly the enactment of the banking law is
essential to support financial sector stability and enhance the sector’s contribution to growth.
The enactment of the banking laws is critical to strengthening the resolution mechanism and
improving central bank independence. In addition, macroeconomic policies, will need to be
supplemented by strong supervision, macro-prudential polices, and a crises preparedness
framework. Finalizing the liquidation of banks under DEBRA and winding down its assets are
essential for building confidence in the banking sector.
65.
Improving the business climate, bringing economic activity out of the shadows,
enhancing productivity and human capital, and addressing infrastructure bottlenecks are
essential to reducing vulnerability and enhancing broad-based growth. Reforms should include
developing an integrated tax compliance strategy which balances assistance, encouragement, and
30

KYRGYZ REPUBLIC

enforcement. The energy sector should be placed on a sound commercial footing with lower
subsidies, better management, and simplified access to the grid. The regime for cross border trade
should be simplified by reducing the number of procedures and documents needed. The same is
necessary for the process of contract enforcement and for resolving insolvency. A constructive and
fair resolution to the dispute with Centerra is not only necessary to prevent potential disruptions in
gold production but also to create a stable and predictable investment climate.
66.
The authorities’ efforts to keep the program on track are commendable. The
unbudgeted fiscal expansion this year has worsened the debt situation and the delay in passing the
Banking Law is regrettable. However, the authorities’ commitments to resume fiscal consolidation
in 2016 with the objective of bringing debt below 65 percent of GDP over the medium term, and to
implement compensatory measures until the banking law is enacted should help to maintain the
program on track.
67.
Risks to the program are significant, but the authorities’ policy commitments under
the program provide sufficient safeguards and the Kyrgyz Republic’s repayment capacity
remains adequate. The key risks are related to negative regional spillovers, uncertainty about gold
production, fluctuating gold prices and volatile exchange rates. Expansionary policies in the run-up
to the 2016 and 2017 elections could weaken the reform process, undermine macroeconomic
stability, and elevate debt to a high risk of distress. Continuous policy dialogue with the Fund will
remain essential for the success of the program, along with the commitment to adjust policies as
needed to achieve the program’s objectives.
68.
Staff supports completing the first review of the authorities program under the ECF
arrangement. Staff support authorities request to modify end-December 2015 QPCs and ITs and to
set new QPCs and ITs for end-March, end-June, end-September, and end-December 2016. The
attached LOI outlines policies for the rest of the year and 2016, to achieve program goals. Staff also
supports the modification of performance criteria.
69.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation be held in accordance with
Decision No. 14747–(10/96).

Annex IV. Debt Sustainability Analysis1
The Kyrgyz Republic remains at a moderate risk of debt distress, but massive foreign financed public
investment in combination with the recent sharp depreciation of the currency is undermining debt
sustainability. While under the DSA, external debt is estimated at 35 percent of GDP and
remittances2in present value (PV) term, additional borrowing or further exchange rate volatility could
take debt above the risk of debt distress. Against this background, the authorities need to exercise more
prudence when contracting and guaranteeing new debt. Furthermore, a primary balance of about
2 percent of GDP by 2018 would be needed in order to bring public debt to sustainable levels. The
authorities broadly concurred with the results of this DSA.
1.
The 2015 updated joint Bank-Fund debt sustainability analysis (DSA) confirms the
moderate risk rating found in the last DSA conducted last May (country report No.15/113).
The update takes into account revised macroeconomic assumptions and updated data on public
investment programs (PIP) borrowings.

Underlying DSA assumptions
2.
This DSA is consistent with the macroeconomic framework outlined in the Staff Report
for the First Review under the ECF (Box 1). For 2015, economic growth is expected to be slightly
higher due to stronger than expected resilience of domestic demand to adverse external shocks. The
fiscal balance in 2015 is expected to improve due to higher than expected nontax revenue and
delays in the implementation of some infrastructure projects. The current account deficit has
widened due to a larger than expected drop in remittances at the beginning of the year and the
reclassification of the Russian-Kyrgyz Development Fund (RKDF) from current transfers to FDI due to
its status of an international organization.

The Kyrgyz Republic is classified as a large remittances case. In the 2012–14 period remittances averaged
29 percent of GDP and 61 percent of exports of goods and services, well above the 10 percent and 20 percent
respective threshold-criteria for the large remittances case.

Box 1. Macroeconomic Assumptions for 2015‒35
Real GDP growth: Following a slowdown due to inclement weather (in 2014) and weak regional growth
(in 2015) real GDP growth is expected to recover gradually in the coming years and reach its potential
estimated at 5 percent by 2018. Growth in the medium to long run will be supported by infrastructure and
energy investments, strong private credit growth and policy reforms aimed at improving the business
climate.
Inflation is expected to remain at single-digit levels due to low fuel and food prices and prudent monetary
policy. In the long-run inflation is anticipated to decrease further to 4 percent.
The current account deficit is expected to remain above 16 percent of GDP in 2015–16, driven by lower gold
exports, the import content of the large investment projects and the drop in remittances in the context of
the regional slowdown. After the unwinding of the public investment projects, and driven by a recovery of
remittances, the current account deficit should stabilize at around 10 percent of GDP in the long-run.
Public investment: While PIP disbursement were somewhat delayed in 2015 (US$344 million instead of the
projected US$505 million), they are expected to pick up in the medium run. As a result, capital expenditure is
expected to amount to 16.5 percent of GDP in 2016 exceeding the level of private investment. Public
investment should gradually decline beyond 2020 to stabilize at around 8 percent of GDP.
FDI: The reclassification of the Russian-Kyrgyz Development Fund (RKDF) resulted in an upward revision to
FDI levels in the short to medium run. The implementation of the main public infrastructure projects is
expected to increase net FDI flows to 8 percent of GDP in 2016–17. In the long-run FDI should stabilize at
5 percent of GDP.
The overall fiscal deficit is expected to increase above 4 percent by 2016 driven by elevated capital
expenditures owing to public infrastructure projects. Following the unwinding of large public investments,
the fiscal balance should stabilize gradually at around 1 percent of GDP in the long-run.

Box 1. Macroeconomic Assumptions for 2015–35 (concluded)
Financing: FDI and concessional borrowing are expected to be the main source of financing for public
infrastructure investments. The average grant element of new external borrowing is projected to remain
above 40 percent in the medium-run, but in line with our assumption of a gradual shift towards market
financing beyond 2020, effective interest rates are expected to increase from the current 2 percent to close
to 7 percent by the end of the forecast period. Remittances are projected to remain a major source of
financing (close to 28 percent of GDP in 2016–17), but their share in percent of GDP should decline
to 20 percent over the long term reflecting the diversification of the economy

3.
The baseline scenario indicates a deterioration of the external debt burden in
comparison with the previous DSA. External public and publicly guaranteed debt is projected at
63 percent of GDP in 2015,3 which is 3 percentage points above the previous DSA. The higher than
expected debt level in 2015 is mainly due to the 16 percent depreciation of the som vis-à-vis the
U.S. dollar, while the delays in PIP disbursements contained the accumulation of external debt. In the
medium-run, strong public investment is expected to keep external PPG debt at elevated levels,
close to 65 percent of GDP.

4.
Planned infrastructure investments and depreciation of the national currency since the
beginning of the year have brought external PPG debt closer to the high risk of debt distress
level threshold. The present value of the public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) debt to GDP and
remittances ratio is expected to reach 35 percent in 2016 and 2017, above the level envisaged in the
previous DSA and within a 10 percent band around the 36 percent (34.2‒37.8) corresponding
threshold, signaling the Kyrgyz Republic as a borderline case. As regards the other solvency and
liquidity indicators they do not breach their indicative thresholds and imply limited risks.
5.
The external PPG debt outlook also remains vulnerable to large shocks, in particular to
a further depreciation of the exchange rate. The PV of the debt to GDP and remittances ratio
rises above the relevant indicative thresholds over the medium term under four of the six standard
3

External public and publicly guaranteed debt includes the debt of the 19 largest SOEs.

stress tests: (i) when the exports grow at one standard deviation below their historical average over
2016–17; (ii) when the net non-debt creating inflows over 2016–17 are one standard deviation below
their historical average; (iii) when the exchange rate depreciates by 30 percent in 2016 relative to the
baseline; and (iv) under a shock over 2016–17 combining lower GDP and export growth, a decline in
the U.S. dollar GDP deflator and lower net nondebt creating inflows (see Table 2). The shock on the
exchange rate, which in magnitude is not far from the actual depreciation experienced this year, in
particular would lead to a significant and protracted breach of the indicative threshold over the
medium term.
6.
The sharp decline in remittances presents an additional downside risk. Under the
baseline scenario we assume a 20 percent drop in remittances in USD terms driven by the regional
economic slowdown in 2015, followed by a gradual recovery in 2016 and 2017. Under a customized
alternative scenario, which assumes an additional one-time 10 percent drop in remittances, the
present value of the debt to GDP ratio would remain above 37 percent for a prolonged period after
2017, further elevating debt levels towards high risk of debt distress. Moreover, the private external
debt also increased with the exchange rate depreciation adding stress on the overall external debt
sustainability.
7.
The probability approach confirms the Kyrgyz Republic’s external risk rating as
moderate.4 Given that one of the indicative thresholds is nearly breached under the baseline and
several thresholds are breached under the stress test scenarios, Kyrgyz is classified as a
moderate-high borderline case. The probability approach indicates no breaches of the probability
thresholds (Figure 3), confirming the moderate risk of external debt distress.
Public debt sustainability
8.
The public debt outlook has also deteriorated compared to the previous DSA, mainly
driven by the increase in external public debt following the depreciation of the som. Public
debt is expected to reach 64.9 percent of GDP in 2015 and increase further to 67.6 percent of GDP
in 2017 following the disbursement for the public infrastructure projects.
9.
Total public debt is expected to be manageable in the medium and long term. Under
the baseline scenario, the present value of public debt to GDP ratio would reach
46.7 percent in 2017, followed by a decline in the context of medium term fiscal
consolidation. In the longer run, the present value of total public debt is expected to stabilize at
45 percent of GDP. Alternative scenarios and stress tests show that public debt remains highly
sensitive to shocks that reduce real GDP growth, weaken the exchange rate or deteriorate the
primary deficit over the medium term.

4

The probability approach draws on country specific CPIA and GDP growth information to project debt distress
probabilities.

10.
The recently prepared medium-term debt strategy will need to be updated. It needs to
include the most recent macroeconomic developments and the revised medium-term
macroeconomic framework. While limiting the foreign exchange exposure of the debt portfolio
would help to lower exchange rate vulnerabilities, it would need to be weighed against potentially
higher financing costs due to less concessional terms available on domestic markets. Furthermore,
establishing a viable alternative to external borrowing might take considerable time given the lack of
depth of local bond markets.
Conclusion
11.
While external PPG debt is expected to remain at a moderate risk of debt distress,
immediate action is needed to contain it and bring it back to sustainable levels. The
medium-term fiscal framework has been revised and now contains consolidation efforts totaling
4.6 percent of GDP in the 2016–18 period. Debt monitoring to minimize fiscal risk stemming from
SOEs should be strengthened. Debt management should also benefit from the review of the public
investment framework that authorities committed to undertake.5
12.
The Kyrgyz authorities broadly concurred with the assumptions and conclusions,
including identified vulnerabilities, of this DSA. They agreed that debt vulnerabilities have
increased since the beginning of the year bringing the country to the borderline of high risk of debt
distress. The authorities expressed their will to maintain public external debt at sustainable levels
over the medium-term. To help them meet this objective, and given elevated debt vulnerabilities,
staff agreed with the authorities’ request to maintain an indicative target on zero-non-concessional
borrowing. The authorities are also committed to a primary balance of about 2 percent of GDP
by 2018 to ensure debt sustainability.

5

The World Bank has provided technical assistance to the authorities in recent years on developing a medium-term
debt management strategy, focusing on capacity building and on the quantification of costs and risks of alternative
borrowing strategies, which lead eventually to a structured approach to future borrowing.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Annex V. Reserve Metrics and Exchange Rate Assessment
The Kyrgyz Republic suffered from the continued current accounts deficits over the past decade,
financed mainly by foreign loans and foreign direct investments.1 Since 2014, the real effective
exchange rate (REER) has appreciated, while the recent share depreciation of the som slightly reversed
the trend. The reserves appear slightly insufficient to buffer the economy against external shocks.
Moreover, factors beyond the level of the REER play a prominent role, given political instability, lack of
infrastructure and electricity, and a weak business environment.

A. External current account
1.
The chronic current account has deteriorated on account of a difficult external
environment. The current account deficit recorded 16.8 percent of GDP in 2014 on account of a
decline in remittances and a rise in the balance of services deficit. The current account deficit is
projected to continue to widen in 2015 to 17.6 percent of GDP, reflecting slowdown in major trading
partners, despite a sharp depreciation of the som.
2.
Accordingly, public financing to finance such current account deficit has increased. It
has historically been largely financed by private sources, both FDI and loans. Since the launch of the
PIP in 2011, however, the public share of the financing has significantly increased. Gross PIP
disbursements are expected to represent 6 percent of GDP in 2015, a level close to the FDI inflows.

B. Exchange rate and competitiveness
3.

Staff’s estimates suggest that the exchange rate is moderately overvalued:

x

The macroeconomic balance approach in the External Balance Assessment (EBA) is estimated on
the basis of existing fundamentals and desirable policies. It points to a current account norm
of -11.5 percent of GDP, given the projected current account deficit for 2015 of 16 percent of
GDP. This implies an overvaluation of the exchange rate of about 14 percent.

x

The macroeconomic balance in the CGER-type methodologies (which rely on medium terms
fundamentals) points to a more moderate estimated REER overvaluation of 9 percent, while the
CGER external sustainability approach suggests that the som is slightly overvalued by less than
1 percent.

x

Finally, the purchasing power parity approach that compares the current REER value to its
10 year historical average also suggests a mild overvaluation of about 4 percent.

1

The real effective exchange rate assessment should be interpreted cautiously due to data limitation and the high
dollarization of the economy but the REER seems to be broadly in line with the fundamentals.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

65

KYRGYZ REPUBLIC

x

Overall, the analyses suggest an overvaluation of the real exchange rate albeit with a difference
in magnitude, but the recent share depreciation of the som might help the overvalued exchange
rate squared.

4.
Nonprice competitiveness is also an issue in Kyrgyz Republic. The political instability and
the lack of electricity and infrastructure constitute an impediment to the development of the
tradable sector. Moreover the business environment is weak. The 2015 World Bank Doing Business
report points the difficulty to trade across borders, to get electricity and to resolve insolvency. The
country needs to address these challenges and to diversify its economy to fully benefit from its
accession to the EEU and attract investors.

C. Reserves adequacy
5.
Preserving the level of foreign exchange reserves calls for a further depreciation of the
som against the dollar. Indeed, while appropriately letting the som gradually depreciate, the NBKR
has significantly intervened this year to smooth the volatility of the exchange rate. These
interventions have depleted the foreign reserves, which are expected to cover 3.7 months of imports
by the end of the year compared to a level of 4.1 months in 2014. The external shock the country is
currently facing and the high dollarization of the economy call for a careful management of reserves.
The 2014 level of reserve was lower than the CCA countries average but higher than the region’s oil
and gas importers’ average level.
6.
The IMF’s assessing reserve adequacy (ARA) metrics suggests that the reserve level at
end–2015 remains adequate, albeit a significant drop. The methodology balances the costs of
holding reserves to its benefit in terms of crisis prevention taking into account the country’s
fundamentals and some potential external shocks it could faces. It estimates that the adequate level
of reserves, using the 2015 fiscal deficit of 3.5 percent, varies from one to four months depending
on the costs of holding reserves. Considering that the cost of holdings reserves is unlikely to be
inferior to 3 percent in the Kyrgyz Republic, the current and projected reserves coverage appears to

66

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KYRGYZ REPUBLIC

be adequate. However, two factors call for a higher reserves coverage: (i) the model doesn’t include
any shock on remittances which represented about 30 percent of the Kyrgyz’s GDP in 2014, and
have been quite volatile in the past and are expected to fall by 20 percent in 2015; and (ii) the model
doesn’t take into account the high level of dollarization of the economy that increases the country’s
exchange rate exposure. Therefore, it is important to return to a path of a gradual reserve build up.

Appendix I. Letter of Intent
November 18, 2015
Ms. Christine Lagarde
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, N.W.
Washington, D.C., 20431
USA

Dear Madame Lagarde:
We continue to make progress on a comprehensive economic and financial reform program,
supported by an arrangement under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) approved by the IMF
Executive Board on April 8, 2015. We are grateful to the IMF for its continued support.
The turbulent regional context is taking a toll on our economy. In particular, the economic decline in
Russia has slashed remittances, a key source of foreign exchange and driver of domestic demand.
The knock on effect on our currency from the depreciations of the Russian, Kazakh and most
recently Chinese currencies elevates the risks to the financial sector and the sustainability of public
debt. Growth remains modest due to decrease in gold production despite relatively good results in
the rest of the economy. The central bank’s tight monetary policy, together with low food and fuel
prices, has kept inflation in check mitigating the effects of currency depreciation.
We remain committed to the policies and objectives supported by the ECF arrangement. Our actions
ensured that all end-June 2015 quantitative performance criteria and all indicative targets were met.
All but two structural benchmarks were met. The draft law for strengthening of the VAT by reducing
the number of exemptions and gradually phasing of the sales tax was submitted in August instead
of June. Due to protracted inter-agency deliberations, the audit of DEBRA was not finalized in
October 2015. Notwithstanding the setbacks in passing the Banking Code, we remain committed to
work with Parliament to enact it and have it published in the Official Gazette (“Erkin-Too”) by
end-September 2016.
In view of the progress made and our continued commitment to the program, as well as the recently
completed safeguards assessment of the NBKR, we request completion of the first review and
disbursement in the amount of SDR 9.514 million (US$13.17 million). We ask that the disbursements
under the ECF arrangement be channeled to the budget.
We believe that the economic and financial policies set forth in our Letter of Intent (LOI) and
Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) dated March 24, 2015 supplemented by
this LOI remain adequate to meet the program’s objectives.

68

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KYRGYZ REPUBLIC

We will continue to maintain a policy dialogue and consult with the IMF, at our own initiative or
whenever the Managing Director of the IMF requests such a consultation, in advance of revisions to
the policies contained in our LOI, in accordance with the IMF’s policies on such consultations. We
will provide IMF staff with data and information necessary for monitoring program implementation
in accordance with this Letter of Intent.
As in the past, the government of the Kyrgyz Republic agrees to the publication of this letter, the
Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU), as well as of the Article IV Staff Report related to
the first review under the ECF arrangement and the Debt Sustainability Analysis.

Recent economic developments
1.
Over the past months, our economy was buffeted by a wave of external shocks,
including falling gold prices, falling remittances due to the economic slowdown in Russia,
turbulence in regional currency markets, and uncertainty surrounding EEU accession.
Nonetheless, the economy grew at a solid 6.3 percent during the first nine months of 2015 fueled by
a bumper agricultural season and solid performance in all but textile and power sectors.
2.
Twelve-month inflation slowed down during the first nine months of 2015 to
6.4 percent due mainly to low food prices. The benefits from lower fuel import prices were
partially offset by depreciation of the som against the U.S. dollar.
3.
The overall fiscal deficit reached 0.6 percent of GDP by end of June. Revenues at
16.7 percent of GDP were better than expected, mainly due to the sale of the Geroi mining license
and NBKR dividends, representing, respectively, 1.4 and 1.2 percentage points of GDP. Government
expenditures were contained at 16.1 percent of GDP, mainly due to underspending on goods and
services and delays in project implementation. The current account deficit narrowed over the first six
months amid falling trade activity. Nongold exports and imports dropped by 26 percent and
17 percent year-on-year, respectively. Remittances fell by 28 percent year-on-year over the first nine
months of 2015. While debt is expected to remain at moderate risk of distress, the som depreciation
and the sharp drop in remittances is pushing the debt level closer to the threshold of high risk of
distress.
4.
NBKR intervened in the foreign exchange market in order to smooth out currency
fluctuations and counter speculative pressures. By end of September net sales were
US$171 million. As a result the som depreciated by 16.9 percent over the same period. These
interventions have also led to further monetary tightening, with base money shrinking by
4.3 percent (year-on-year) over the first nine months of this year.
5.
Credit growth is slowing down, and as of end of September grew by 27.0 percent
year-on-year. This includes loans provided by microfinance agency FINCA which obtained a
banking license earlier this year. Controlling for exchange rate depreciation credit grew by

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

69

KYRGYZ REPUBLIC

12.3 percent over the same period. Exchange rate volatility resulted in increase of deposit
dollarization to 68.3 and decrease in loan dollarization to 55.2 percent by end of September. NPLs
rose to 6.0 percent of total loans by the end of September, or 9.6 percent when extended loans are
included.

Outlook and risks
6.
Growth will slow in 2015 due mainly to falling gold production and the impact of
external shocks. We expect growth to pick up to an average of around 4 percent in the coming
years as the Russian and Kazakh economies bottom out and the benefits from membership in the
EEU begin to materialize. The PIP program and projects initiated under the Russia-Kyrgyz
Development Fund (RKDF) should contribute to stabilizing growth at about 5 percent in the medium
term.
7.
We expect inflation to exceed 7 percent by the end of the year, driven by the som
depreciation, seasonal uptick in public spending and the impact of higher EEU import tariffs.
Over the medium term, inflation is expected to remain within the 5–7 percent range announced by
the NBKR.
8.
We expect the overall fiscal deficit to reach 3.7 percent of GDP by the end of the year.
Compared to last year, tax revenues are expected to decrease by 0.8 percentage points of GDP, due
to the delay in EEU accession, while current expenditures will increase by 1.1 percentage points of
GDP, due to unbudgeted spending commitments. Over the medium term, the fiscal deficit will
gradually decline due to fiscal consolidation and the phasing out of current PIPs.
9.
The current account deficit will reach 16 percent of GDP on account of weak external
demand, falling remittances and fall in U.S. dollar value of GDP. Access to the larger EEU
market, fiscal consolidation and phasing out of PIPs will enable us to gradually reduce external
imbalances.
10.
We are mindful of the risks to our outlook. Key downside risks include, lower gold output
and prices, adverse economic development in our major trading partners, protracted discussions
with Centerra on Kumtor, unfavorable external debt dynamics and vulnerable financial system due
to high dollarization and exchange rate volatility.

The government’s policies for the remainder of the year and 2016
To keep the program on track, we will implement the necessary policies to ensure that the program’s
objectives are achieved. In this context, we will carry out the necessary measures to prevent budgetary
slippages. We remain committed to reducing inflation and maintaining a flexible exchange rate that
would allow us to preserve the NBKR’s reserves. We will do our best to have the draft banking law
adopted by the new parliament in a form substantially similar to the draft submitted to Parliament in
September 2013. We will select an auditor for DEBRA in November 2015 and we will make sure that
the audit is finalized by the first quarter of 2016.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KYRGYZ REPUBLIC

Fiscal policy
11.
Despite a challenging year, including adverse regional and domestic environment, we
are committed to ensure that the end of year fiscal deficit is in line with the program target.
Our second supplementary budget targets an overall deficit of 3.7 percent of GDP. However, we
expect that through frugal budget execution, we will bring the deficit down to 3.5 percent of GDP. In
order to meet our 2015 program commitments, we will streamline expenditures as needed and
refrain from new recurring spending commitments unless these are financed by new permanent
revenue measures. We also remain committed to keeping the teachers’ salary increase, which came
into effect in September at an estimated cost of som 2.2 billion, budget neutral.
12.
We are preparing our 2016 budget in line with program targets. As per our
commitment, we will resume fiscal consolidation to maintain public debt at a sustainable level,
which will require us to focus on revenue enhancement and expenditure streamlining. To this end,
while the overall balance will deteriorate due to the postponement of some PIP projects from
2015 to 2016, nonetheless, we will target an operating surplus of 5.9 percent of GDP. To meet this
target, we will undertake a fiscal effort of at least 1.6 percentage points of GDP excluding expected
EEU customs revenues which we aim to save to gradually rebuild thin fiscal buffers. In addition, to
ensure that the increase in teacher’s salaries stay neutral, we will improve the mechanisms of
accruing and paying certain types of nontax payments, in particular payments for rent of state
property, payments related to development of various mineral fields, and payments for entrance by
foreign countries vehicles.
13.
In order to ensure that the budget deficit target of 4.5 percent of the GDP is met, we
are committed to implementing the following measures:
x

Strengthening the administration of the VAT with a view to reducing tax evasion towards
broadening the tax base and streamlining exemptions;

x

Raising excise tax rates on alcohol and tobacco products as part of the process of their
harmonization with the EEU rates;

x

Refraining from extending expiring exemptions or granting new ones;

x

Introducing similar stamps for domestically produced goods for control and accounting
purposes aimed at preventing counterfeit production, in order to harmonize the regulations
regarding the movement of goods within the EEU; and

x

Adding luxury tax components to the property tax by applying higher rates or step-up
coefficients.

14.
x

The following expenditures measure will be carried out to meet the deficit target:
Reducing the wage bill by, among others, rationalizing support staff, and refraining from ad hoc
wage increases. We will also identify additional measures that would ensure that the teachers’

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

71

KYRGYZ REPUBLIC

salary increase is budget neutral. Additionally, in the context of the review of wage bill, we will
set up an action plan, in view of the findings of the forthcoming FAD TA mission, to decrease the
wage bill to about 8 percent of GDP over the medium term (structural benchmark, May 2016);
x

Maintaining spending on goods and services constant in nominal terms and refraining from any
ad hoc measures.

x

Reducing the subsidies and transfers budget line to about 3 percent of GDP. To this end we will
conduct a review of subsidies and draw-up an action plan to reduce them (structural benchmark,
June 2016).

x

Continue to improve the targeting of social benefits and avoiding their duplication.

x

Keeping domestically financed capital spending around 3 percent of GDP.

15.
We are determined to strengthen tax collection. Following accession to the EEU, VAT and
excise collections for imported goods shifted from customs services to the state tax services (STS). In
addition, the National Statistics Committee functions of state registration of individual
entrepreneurs will be transferred to the STS. The STS will conduct a pilot testing of collecting social
contributions for two districts in 2016 (instead of being collected by the social fund). If the results
are positive, the STS will take over the overall collection of the social contributions. In order to avoid
negative impact on tax collection, we will ensure proper staffing of the STS by transferring staff from
other agencies while keeping the total volume of public sector employees unchanged.
16.
We are committed to maintain debt at sustainable level. The recent depreciation of the
som has exacerbated our debt vulnerability bringing us to the borderline of high risk of debt
distress. We are committed to maintain public external debt to sustainable level over the medium
term. In the period ahead, we will be particularly cautious with our borrowing plans. To that effect,
we will introduce an action plan to improve the quality and efficiency of the public investment
process in view of the findings of the forthcoming Public Investment Management Assessment
mission (structural benchmark, April 2016). Additionally, we will: (i) revise the Medium Term Debt
Strategy in line with the outcome of the new DSA (structural benchmark, July 2016); (ii) continue to
fully disclose borrowing plans and commitments; (iii) improve debt monitoring, to minimize fiscal
risk stemming from SOEs; and (iv) refrain from nonconcessional borrowing. In light of the Fund’s
new debt limit policy, we will adhere to the quantitative performance criteria (QPCs) on the present
value (PV) of new external debt contracted. In addition given out debt vulnerability we request an
indicative target (IT) of zero nonconcessional borrowing. In preparation for the heating season and
as an exception in light of adverse weather condition, one of our SOEs, JSC “Electric Stations” will
borrow a non-concessional US$30 million loan from the Eurasian Development Bank to pay for fuel
and service liabilities.

Monetary and exchange rate policy
17.
We will focus on containing inflation within our target range of 5 to 7 percent in the
medium term, while preserving financial system stability. We will maintain the policy rate
positive in real terms and adjust its level in line with emerging inflationary and exchange rate
pressures. We will continue to employ all available instruments, while balancing it against the
trade-off of the financial sector health. Moreover, the NBKR and the ministry of finance will continue
our close coordination to facilitate liquidity management.
18.
We will concentrate our efforts on enhancing the transmission mechanism and
promoting the interbank market. To strengthen the interest rate channel, we will aim to narrow
the corridor around the policy rate and make it symmetric. At the same time, we will also undertake
measures to deepen the interbank market by: (i) maintaining liquidity at a level that provides
incentive for interbank trading; (ii) allowing NBKR notes to be used as collateral in the interbank
market; and (iii) further improving NBKR’s communication about the monetary policy stance.
19.
We will continue to pursue a flexible exchange rate policy in order to reduce external
imbalances and safeguard foreign exchange reserves. We carry out interventions in the foreign
exchange market only to smooth excessive fluctuations. In this context we will carefully monitor the
tightening effect of our foreign exchange interventions to avoid stifling credit activity and harm
growth. We will also work to further reduce speculative pressures on the exchange rate by
enhancing our communication, strengthening regulation of exchange bureaus and eliminating
unlicensed banking operations and foreign exchange activity. Parliament rejected amendments to
the code on administrative responsibility increasing penalties for unlicensed banking operations
including foreign exchange activity. We will resubmit these amendments to the new parliament
(structural benchmark, February 2016).
Financial sector
20.
The Government and NBKR remain committed to make every effort to enact the
Banking Law in a form substantially similar to the draft submitted to parliament in
September 2013. In June 2015, parliament passed the first reading of the Banking Code but
downgraded it to a law. However, the second and third readings were not completed due to the lack
of quorum in the run-up to the October elections. The government and the NBKR will work with the
new parliament to ensure the enactment and publication in the Official Gazette (“Erkin-Too) of the
draft banking law and the supporting law on “enacting the banking law” (structural benchmark,
September 2016). Should the new parliament chose to restart the process, we will resubmit the code
in line with the September 2013 draft. We understand that progress in that area would be necessary
to move forward with the program and will inform IMF staff on any proposed amendments.
21.
We will make every effort that the new banking legislation is consistent with
international best practice and meets the following criteria: (i) can only be superseded by the
Constitution or Constitutional Laws which may require reviewing all existing codes, identifying the
ones that need to be amended and passing the relevant amendments; (ii) preserves the autonomy

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

73

KYRGYZ REPUBLIC

of the NBKR; (iii) improves the framework for early intervention and resolution of problem banks;
(iv) enhances legal protection for the NBKR staff; (v) limits the scope of judicial review for decisions
taken by the NBKR with respect to license revocation and bank resolution; (vi) establishes the NBKR
as the sole authority to hold and manage official foreign reserves; (vii) extends the term of
engagement of the NBKR external auditors; and (viii) strengthens the internal oversight of the NBKR.
22.
We will continue our efforts to preserve financial sector stability and reduce
dollarization, relying exclusively on market-based measures. We are analyzing the impact of the
macro-prudential measures introduced in May 2015 with a view to fine-tuning them as necessary.
We have set higher reserve requirements on foreign exchange deposits. In addition, we will consider
and if deemed necessary introduce regulation to restrict foreign exchange lending to borrowers with
less than 50 percent of their income in foreign currency. At the same time, we are:
(i) continuing to strengthen banking sector supervision by developing a strategic plan to build
supervisory capacity and to provide for a robust supervisory program, including risk based
supervision; (ii) conducting crisis simulation exercise by March 2016 and developing crises
preparedness framework together with Ministry of Finance and Deposit Protection Agency
(structural benchmark, September 2016); (iii) enhancing the model for macro-financial stress testing;
and (iv) closely monitoring banks, particularly those with large exposure to trade, construction,
mortgage, and consumer loans. Moreover, to avoid destabilizing the banking sector we will rely
exclusively on market based measures.
23.
We will facilitate the sharing of credit information. In this context, we will give our best
efforts to adopt supporting amendments to other laws to enact the Law on Credit Information
Sharing. We will ensure that state registration service and state tax service exchange information
with credit bureau, as this will provide the complete and best information to credit issuers.
24.
We will accelerate efforts to resolve all problem banks to enhance confidence in the
banking system. Given the divergence of views between different government agencies we were
not able to finalize the DEBRA audit on time. However, we remain fully committed to completing
this audit including all banks under DEBRA’s management with a goal of liquidating them and
winding down DEBRA’s assets. Following the successful launch of the audit tender we will select an
auditor in November 2015 (prior action) and aim to finalize the audit during the first quarter of
2016 (structural benchmark, March 2016).
25.
We are committed to strengthening and implementing an AML/CFT regime in line
with international standards. While the outgoing Parliament rejected the previous draft of the
AML/CFT law, we will submit a new draft AML/CFT law that reflects all the recommendations
provided by the Fund to the new Parliament (structural benchmark, April 2016). Timely action
through the submission, adoption and entry into force of the law should contribute to a positive
assessment of the national AML/CFT system Eurasian Group on Combating Money Laundering and
Financing of Terrorism (EAG) in October 2016.
26.
The Russia Kyrgyz Development Fund (RKDF) commenced operations as an
international organization. Two loans totaling som 1.2 billion were granted to two state owned

74

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KYRGYZ REPUBLIC

banks—Aiyl and RSK for on-lending. We expect the fund’s activities to provide a boost to the
economy, particularly at this critical juncture. Through our representatives at the Board of the Fund,
we will ensure that RKDF will continue to follow international best practice for development banks
and institutions and carries out its activities without causing market distortions. We will continue to
maintain a level playing field among the various agents operating the financial-investment space.
We will make sure that neither the government, nor the NBKR are liable for obligations (including
guarantees) of the RKDF, and vice versa.
Institutional and structural reforms to ensure board based growth
27.
We recognize the need to further improve the business environment, a key pillar of
sustainable and inclusive growth. Improving business and investment climate is essential if we are
to realize the full benefits from EEU membership. In this context we will redouble our effort to
address weaknesses identified by among others the World Bank Doing Business report by:
(i) removing obstacles to starting a business by streamlining the licensing process; (ii) streamlining
tax and other inspection regimes; and (iii) streamlining property registration and establishing a
unified and transparent procedure for access to utilities including the power grid. We will undertake
a review of the tax regime aimed at ensuring simplicity, fairness and equal treatment of all tax
payers, a precondition for reducing the shadow economy. We will put all our efforts toward a
constructive resolution of the dispute with Centerra to ensure that it does not lead to disruptions in
gold production. A stable and predictable investment climate with proper contract enforcement,
strong property rights, less red tape and corruption are essential for attracting investment and
spurring private sector-led growth.
28.
We will continue our effort to reform the energy sector with the aim of improving
service delivery and putting it on sound economic footing. In this context, we are: (i) reviewing
the regulatory framework to clarify roles and responsibilities; (ii) enhancing policy planning and
management and establishing a national power clearance center to improve coordination among
the various actors; (iii) working to improve internal controls, introducing management information
systems (MIS) at power companies, and rolling out smart power meters; (iv) reviewing the
methodology for setting power tariffs to ensure economic soundness, and implementing the plan
for increasing tariffs (structural benchmark, August 2016) and developing targeting social
protections; and (v) continuing reforms in the power sector and improving conditions for private
sector investment.
29.
PFM Reforms will remain our top priority. We continue to press ahead with PFM reforms
and will shortly agree to a new Multi Donor Trust Fund arrangement. The integration of the
automated national treasury system with the interbank payments system, which is a requirement for
the Treasury Single Account (TSA) system, is being tested and became operational as of
October 1, 2015 for customs receipts. The implementation of the TSA for all transactions would
speed up the launching of the new Financial Management Information System (FMIS). To that effect,
a Memorandum of Co-operation with TIKA, the Turkish Cooperation and Coordination Agency to
finance the new FMIS will be signed in the second quarter of 2016 (structural
benchmark, June 2016). We will work to develop a methodological framework for budgetary risks,
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

75

KYRGYZ REPUBLIC

with the help of the IMF TA. We remain committed to extend treasury coverage to the Social Fund
with the implementation of the FMIS and to make every effort to ensure the enactment by
Parliament of a budget code that is consistent with IMF and World Bank advice.
30.
We are committed to pursue trade liberalization to enhance efficiency and strengthen
growth prospects. The country officially became a member of the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU)
in August 2015. We remain committed to implementing the EEU commitments for promoting trade
with regional countries. Also, our government will continue to pursue greater regional economic and
social integration, and advocate for further steps to open up the country with a view to enhancing
competition and efficiency.

Program monitoring
31.
The ECF-supported program will continue to be monitored through prior actions,
quantitative performance criteria, continuous performance criteria, indicative targets, and
structural benchmarks. Prior actions and structural benchmarks are set out in Table 1. Quantitative
performance criteria (QPC) for December 2015 and June 2016 and indicative targets (IT) for
December 2015, March, June and September 2016 and continuous performance criteria are set out
in Table 2. Program reviews will continue to be conducted semi-annually, based on end-June and
end-December test dates. The second review is expected to be completed before June 30,
2016 based on continuous and end-December 2015 QPC. The third review is expected to be
completed before December 31, 2016 based on continuous and end-June 2016 QPC. The fourth
review is expected to be completed before June 30, 2017 based on continuous and
end-December 2016 QPC. The understandings between the Kyrgyz authorities and IMF staff
regarding the quantitative performance criteria and structural benchmarks described in this LOI and
reporting requirements are further specified in the attached Technical Memorandum of
Understanding (TMU).
32.
In line with the recommendations of the IMF safeguards assessment of the NBKR, we
are taking the necessary measures to improve the NBKR’s governance arrangements, audit
mechanisms, and internal controls. Once adopted, the banking law will enable us to overcome key
safeguards vulnerabilities by enhancing the institutional autonomy of the NBKR, independent
oversight, and the external audit mechanism. In the interim, our future audit engagement letters will
ensure that the audits are compliant with International Standards of Auditing, and the engagement
partner meets with the audit committee to discuss the audit plan and findings. In addition, NIR and
NDA data for each test date under the program will be confirmed by an internal (as of end-June)
and external audit (as of end-December). The gold inventory will be physically counted, the value
confirmed, and reconciled to the NIR data before the second review of the program.

Attachment I. Technical Memorandum of Understanding
November 18, 2015

Introduction
This memorandum defines the quantitative performance criteria, indicative targets and adjustors,
and establishes the content and frequency of the data to be provided to IMF staff for program
monitoring related to the economic program supported by an arrangement under the Extended
Credit Facility (ECF). The indicators presented in Table 2 of the Letter of Intent dated
November 18, 2015 reflect the understandings on quantitative performance criteria reached
between the authorities of the Kyrgyz Republic and staff of the IMF.

Quantitative Performance Criteria
A.

Definitions and concepts

Test dates. Quantitative performance criteria are set semi-annually starting June 30, 2015 through
December 31, 2018, and are to be met at the end of each period.
National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic (NBKR). The NBKR is the central bank of the country and is
responsible for the formulation and implementation of monetary policy, bank supervision, and the
payment system. For the purpose of the program, the NBKR includes all its central and regional
offices.
Public sector. For the purpose of the program, the public sector comprises the general government,
the NBKR, the 10 largest nonfinancial public enterprises (enterprises and agencies in which the
government owns more than 50 percent of the shares, but which are not consolidated in the
budget, as listed in Table 1), and any other newly created public development institution. The state
budget comprises central and local government budgets. The general government budget includes
the State and Social Fund budgets.
Foreign-financed Public Investment Program (PIP) loans and grants. The foreign financed PIP is
a program of investments in infrastructure and social sectors agreed by the general government of
the Kyrgyz Republic and its donors (including but not limited to international financial
organizations). The PIP is fully financed by related grants and loans.
Program loans and grants are loans and grants received by the general government for direct
budget support from external donors and not related to PIP financing.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KYRGYZ REPUBLIC

The stock of external payment arrears for program monitoring purposes is defined as the
end-of-period amount of external debt service due and not paid within the grace period specified in
the relevant debt contract, including contractual and late interest. For arrears to exist, a creditor
must claim payment of amounts due and not paid. Amounts in dispute are not considered arrears.
Arrears for which a clearance framework/rescheduling or restructuring has been agreed with the
creditor are not considered arrears for program monitoring purposes. Program arrears would
include any debt service due under such agreements that have not been paid.
Concessional and nonconcessional debt. Concessional debt is defined as debt with a grant
element equivalent of 35 percent or more. The grant element of a debt is the difference between
the present value (PV) of the debt and its nominal value, expressed as a percentage of the nominal
value of the debt. The PV of debt at the time of its contracting is calculated by discounting the
future stream of payments of debt service due on this debt. The discount rate used for this purpose
is 5 percent. The debt refers also to commitments contracted or guaranteed and for which value has
not been received. The calculation of concessionality will take into account all aspects of the loan
agreement, including maturity, grace period, payment schedule, upfront commissions, and
management fees. The calculation is performed by the authorities and verified by the IMF staff
based on the data provided by the authorities.
Variable interest rate. For debts carrying a variable interest rate in the form of a benchmark
interest rate plus a fixed spread, the PV of the debt would be calculated using a program reference
rate plus the fixed spread (in basis points) specified in the debt contract. The program reference rate
for the six-month USD LIBOR is 3.34 percent and will remain fixed for the duration of the program.
The spread of six-month Euro LIBOR over six-month USD LIBOR is -250 basis points. The spread of
six-month JPY LIBOR over six-month USD LIBOR is -300 basis points. The spread of six-month GBP
LIBOR over six-month USD LIBOR is -100 basis points. For interest rates on currencies other than
Euro, JPY, and GDP, the spread over six-month USD LIBOR is -200 basis points.1 Where the variable
rate is linked to a benchmark interest rate other than the six-month USD LIBOR, a spread reflecting
the difference between the benchmark rate and the six-month USD LIBOR (rounded to the nearest
50 bps) will be added.
Valuation changes (program exchange rates). For program monitoring, U.S. dollar-denominated
components of the NBKR’s balance sheets will be valued at the program exchange rates. The
program exchange rate of the KGS to the U.S. dollar is set as of February 17 of 2015 exchange rate
of KGS 60.7523 = US$1. The corresponding cross exchange rates and program gold price for the
duration of the program are provided in Table 2.

1

The program reference rate and spreads are based on the “average projected rate” for the six-month USD LIBOR
over the following 10 years from the [Fall 2014] World Economic Outlook (WEO).

B. Quantitative performance criteria
Floor on net international reserves of the NBKR in convertible currencies
Definitions
Net international reserves (NIR) of the NBKR. The floor on NIR will be calculated as the difference
between total international reserve assets and total international reserve liabilities of the NBKR in
convertible currencies. Total international reserve assets of the NBKR are defined as the NBKR
holdings of monetary gold, holdings of SDRs, reserve position in the IMF, and any holdings of
convertible foreign currencies in cash or with foreign banks, and debt instruments issued by
nonresidents that are liquid. For program purposes, convertible foreign currencies refers only to:
US dollar, Euro, British Pound, Japanese Yen, Swiss Franc, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar.
Accrued interest on deposits, loans, and debt securities are included in reserve assets and liabilities,
correspondingly. Reserve assets pledged as collateral or otherwise encumbered, capital
subscriptions in foreign financial institutions, deposits of resident financial institutions (commercial
banks and deposits earmarked for the Russian-Kyrgyz Development Fund) in foreign currency and
illiquid assets of the NBKR are excluded from NIR. Also excluded are net forward positions, defined
as the difference between the face value of foreign-currency denominated the NBKR off-balance
sheet claims on nonresidents and foreign currency obligations to both residents and nonresidents.
Total international reserve liabilities of the NBKR in convertible currencies are defined as the sum of
Kyrgyz Republic’s outstanding liabilities to the IMF and other convertible currency liabilities to
nonresidents with an original maturity of up to and including one year. NIR is not affected when
foreign assets are received by the NBKR through foreign currency swaps with resident financial
institutions. Total international reserves and NIR decline with the provision of foreign assets by the
NBKR through foreign currency swaps with resident financial institutions2. For program monitoring
purposes, total international reserve assets and liabilities will be valued at the program exchange
rates as described in paragraph 9. Thus calculated, the stock of net international reserves in
convertible currencies amounted to US$1,230 million on September 30, 2015.
Net foreign assets (NFA) of the NBKR. NFA consist of net international reserve assets plus other
net foreign assets, including other net claims on CIS countries, reserve assets pledged as collateral
or otherwise encumbered, capital subscriptions in foreign financial institutions, illiquid assets, and
obligations of the NBKR on SDR allocation. For program monitoring purposes, other NFA will also
be valued at program exchange rates.

2

In case of a currency swap providing for receipt of foreign exchange by the NBKR and transfer of domestic currency
to a resident financial institution, total international reserves increase, NIR remain unchanged, and net claims on
domestic banks in soms increase. In case of a currency swap providing for transfer of foreign exchange by the NBKR
and receipt of domestic currency from a resident financial institution, total international reserves and NIR decrease,
and net claims by NBKR on domestic banks remain unchanged.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KYRGYZ REPUBLIC

Adjustors
The floor on NIR will be adjusted upward/downward to the full extent of any excess/shortfall in
program and other grants and program loans, as given in Table 3 and upward/downward to the full
extent that amortization and interest payments of public external debt is less/more than the
amortization and interest payments given in Table 3.

Ceiling on the net domestic assets of the NBKR
Definitions
Net domestic assets of the NBKR (NDA) are defined as reserve money of the NBKR (defined below),
minus NFA as defined above. Items in foreign currencies will be valued at program exchange rates.
Thus defined, NDA consist of: (a) net claims to the general government from the NBKR; (b) net
claims to other depositary corporations by the NBKR; (c) net claims on other financial corporations;
and (d) all other net assets of the NBKR (other items net). Thus defined, the stock of NDA amounted
to minus KGS 36,686 million on September 30, 2015.
Adjustors
The ceiling on NDA will be adjusted downward/upward to the full extent of any excess/shortfall in
program and other grants and program loans, as given in Table 3 and downward/upward to the full
extent that amortization and interest payments of public external debt is less/more than the
amortization and interest payments given in Table 3.

Ceiling on the cumulative overall cash deficit of the general government
Definitions
The overall cash deficit of the general government will be measured from the financing side (below
the line) as the net cash inflow from financing activities, defined as the net incurrence of liabilities
minus the net acquisition of financial assets other than cash. These will be measured at current
exchange rates and will be defined as the sum of:
x

The change in the stock of net claims of the domestic banking system and nonfinancial
institutions and households on the general government. The change in the stock of net claims of
the domestic banking system on the general government is defined as the change in the stock
of the banking system claims on the general government, less the change in the stock of all
deposits of the general government with the banking system. The claims of the banking system
on the general government include: bank loans to the general government; any securities issued
by the general government and held by domestic banks and overdrafts on the current accounts
of the general government with banks;

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

83

KYRGYZ REPUBLIC

x

The change in the stock of net claims of foreign governments, banking systems, and
nonfinancial institutions and households on the general government;

x

Net transactions in equity, i.e., any new sales net of purchases of shares;

x

Net foreign loans disbursed to the general government for budgetary support; and

x

Net foreign loans disbursed to the general government for PIP financing.

The quantitative performance criteria for the fiscal balance are calculated on the projected exchange
rate. Reporting and adjustments, as defined above, will be made using current exchange rates.
Adjustors
The ceiling on the cumulative overall cash deficit of the general government will be adjusted
downward to the full extent of any excess in program grants, as given in Table 3. The ceiling on the
cumulative overall cash deficit of the general government will be adjusted downward to the full
extent of any shortfall in program loans, as given in Table 3 and upward/downward to the full extent
that PIP loans are more/less than PIP loans given in Table 3.
Ceiling on the PV of new external debt contracted, contracting or guaranteeing of new non
concessional external debt, and accumulation of new external payment arrears by the public
sector (continuous quantitative performance criteria).
Definitions
Debt. In connection with the contracting or guaranteeing of short-, medium-, and long-term
external debt by any entity of the public sector, for program purposes, the definition of debt is set
out in Executive Board Decision No. 6230–(79/140), as amended by Decision No. 15688–(14/107),
point 9, adopted December 5, 2014, and reads as follows:
x

For the purpose of this guideline, the term “debt” will be understood to mean a current, i.e., not
contingent, liability, created under a contractual arrangement through the provision of value in
the form of assets (including currency) or services, and which requires the obligor to make one
or more payments in the form of assets (including currency) or services, at some future point(s)
in time; these payments will discharge the principal and/or interest liabilities incurred under the
contract. Debts can take a number of forms, the primary ones being as follows:
I.

84

Loans, i.e., advances of money to the obligor by the lender made on the basis of an
undertaking that the obligor will repay the funds in the future (including deposits,
bonds, debentures, commercial loans, and buyers’ credits) and temporary exchanges
of assets that are equivalent to fully collateralized loans under which the obligor is
required to repay the funds, and usually pay interest, by repurchasing the collateral
from the buyer in the future (such as repurchase agreements and official swap
arrangements);

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KYRGYZ REPUBLIC

x

II.

Suppliers’ credits, i.e., contracts where the supplier permits the obligor to defer
payments until sometime after the date on which the goods are delivered or services
are provided; and

III.

Leases, i.e., arrangements under which property is provided which the lessee has the
right to use for one or more specified period(s) of time that are usually shorter than
the total expected service life of the property, while the lessor retains the title to the
property. For the purpose of the guideline, the debt is the present value (at the
inception of the lease) of all lease payments expected to be made during the period
of the agreement excluding those payments that cover the operation, repair or
maintenance of the property.

Under the definition of debt set out in point 9 (a) above, arrears, penalties, and judicially
awarded damages arising from the failure to make payment under a contractual obligation that
constitutes debt are debt. Failure to make payment on an obligation that is not considered debt
under this definition (e.g., payment on delivery) will not give rise to debt.

For program purposes, external debt is defined based on the residency of the creditor.
External debt ceilings. A performance criterion (ceiling) applies to the present value (PV) of new
external debt, contracted or guaranteed by the public sector with original maturities of one year or
more. The ceiling applies to debt contracted or guaranteed for which value has not yet been
received, including private debt for which official guarantees have been extended. The ceiling is
subject to an adjustor defined below.
An adjustor of up to 5 percent of the external debt ceiling set in PV terms applies to this ceiling, in
case deviations are prompted by a change in the financing terms (interest, maturity, grace period,
payment schedule, upfront commissions, management fees) of a debt or debts. The adjustor cannot
be applied when deviations are prompted by an increase in the nominal amount of total debt
contracted or guaranteed.
A performance criterion apply to the contracting or guaranteeing by the public sector (as defined in
section II. A., paragraph 4) of nonconcessional external debt, i.e., external debt with grant element of
less than 35 percent (see section II. A., paragraph 7), except normal short-term import-related
credits and the NBKR international reserve liabilities.
Exclusions from the external debt limits. Disbursements by the IMF are excluded from the ceilings
on external debt. Also excluded from external debt ceilings is the contracting or guaranteeing of
new external debt that constitutes a rescheduling or refinancing of existing external debt on the
terms more favorable to the debtor.
Guarantees. For program purposes, the guarantee of a debt arises from any explicit legal obligation
of the public sector to service a debt in the event of nonpayment by the debtor (involving payments

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

85

KYRGYZ REPUBLIC

in cash or in kind), or from any implicit legal or contractual obligation of the public sector to finance
partially or in full a shortfall incurred by the debtor.
New external payments arrears. The ceiling on accumulation of new external payments arrears is a
continuous quantitative performance criterion.

C. Indicative targets
Ceiling on reserve money
Reserve money is defined as the NBKR’s national currency liabilities to the economy, which includes
currency issued and liabilities to other depositary corporations.

Cumulative floor on state government tax collections
Tax collections in cash correspond to the line “Tax Receipts” in the Treasury Report and comprise
the following categories: tax on income and profits; taxes on goods and services; specific taxes on
services; turnover taxes; taxes on property; taxes on international trade; and other taxes. Tax
collections include collections of tax arrears but exclude tax offsets.

Cumulative floor on state government spending on targeted social assistance
Targeted social assistance spending comprises state government spending on Unified Monthly
Benefit (UMB) and Monthly Social Benefit (MSB) programs.

Reporting Requirements Under the Arrangement
The government and the NBKR will provide the IMF with the necessary economic and financial
statistical data to monitor economic developments and the quantitative targets (see Table 4). In
particular, the government and the NBKR will provide the following specific information.

D. Analytical balance sheet of the NBKR
The NBKR will provide to the IMF its analytical balance sheet on a daily basis. The information
provided will clearly identify the following items in the definitions specified above: the net foreign
assets of the NBKR; the net international reserves of the NBKR; total reserve assets and total reserve
liabilities of the NBKR ; the net domestic assets of the NBKR; net credit from the NBKR to the general
government, disaggregated by state government and special funds of the KR; net credit from the
NBKR to other deposit corporations and other financial corporations (including Russian-Kyrgyz
Development Fund); other items net; and reserve money. The balance sheet will be provided using
both actual and program exchange rates. The above information will be provided to the IMF
Resident Representative and/or transmitted by e-mail to the IMF.

86

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

E. Monetary survey
Monthly banking system data, in the form of monetary surveys of the banking sector and other
depository corporations, will be reported to the IMF by the NBKR within 16 days of the end of the
month. The information provided will clearly identify the following items: net foreign assets and net
domestic assets of the banking system, net credit from the banking system to the general
government disaggregated by the state government, the social fund and the KRDF, net claims to the
rest of the economy, other items net, and broad money. The monetary survey will be provided using
both program and actual exchange rates.
The NBKR will provide monthly data to the IMF within seven days after the end of the month on the
amount of holdings of treasury bills, treasury bonds and other securities issued by the state
government, differentiated by the following categories of holders: the NBKR; resident banks;
resident nonbanks (including separately the social fund and deposit insurance fund); and
nonresidents. The information will be provided in both the book (nominal) value and the actual
value, where applicable.

F. International reserves and key financial indicators
The NBKR will provide monthly data within 20 days from the end of the month on its gross and net
international reserves within the framework of reporting “International Reserves and Foreign
Currency Liquidity” (IMF’s SDDS). The report on foreign assets and liabilities by currency will be
provided 20 days after the end of each quarter. These data will be provided at two alternative sets of
the exchange rates and the gold price: first, at those used to derive the NFA position in the NBKR
accounts; and second, at those specified in the program (see Section I). The NBKR will also provide
data on net foreign financing flows, including disbursements of program loans and grants,
amortization, interest payments on external debt, interest income on reserves, other direct foreign
currency payments by the government and the NBKR. In addition, reports should be sent to the IMF
on nominal exchange rates (including the official and interbank exchange rates), foreign exchange
interbank market turnover, and the volume of the NBKR foreign exchange sales and purchases in
the domestic interbank market and with other parties, on a daily basis. Reports on treasury bill yields
and the amount of treasury bill sales and redemptions on a weekly basis every Monday. On the
twenty-fifth day of the month following the reference month, the NBKR will provide indicators of
financial soundness of the banking system, including the ratios of regulatory capital to risk-weighted
assets, nonperforming loans to total loans, non-performing loans by sector and by currency,
restructured and prolonged loans by sector and by currency, return on equity, liquidity, earning and
profitability, loans and deposits ratios in domestic and foreign currency, foreign currency exposure
and dollarization as well as data on bank deposits and loans by maturity and sector, and bank
deposit and lending rates by maturity. On the twentieth day of the month following the reference
quarter the NBKR will provide data on non-performing loans for micro-finance organizations and
credit unions.

guaranteeing of medium- and long-term external loans by the state government, nonfinancial
public enterprises, and the NBKR; and any stock of outstanding arrears on external debt service
payments within 21 days of the end of each month. In addition, the ministry of finance will report
the total amount of outstanding government guarantees and external arrears on a monthly basis.
While the NBKR will provide the debt service payment data on private debt, the ministry of finance
will provide data on debt service on public and publicly guaranteed loans.

H. Budgetary and extra budgetary data
In addition to the monthly treasury report, the Social Fund will report monthly on its operations. This
information will be provided to the Fund staff within 26 days from the end of each reference month.

Safeguards assessments
An update assessment with respect to the new ECF approved by the IMF Board on April 8, 2015 was
completed on October 5, 2015. The assessment concluded that the National Bank of the Kyrgyz
Republic (NBKR) continues to have significant vulnerabilities in the legal structure, particularly in
governance arrangements. The audit committee's authority remains limited, as it only has an
advisory role vis-à-vis the NBKR Board. Further, accountability mechanisms, including the external
and internal audits are in need of improvement. The NBKR, in coordination with the government,
should actively pursue and advocate the prompt enactment of the Banking Law. Previous
assessments were completed in October 2011, April 2009, October 2005, and January 2002.
Exchange rate arrangements
The currency of the Kyrgyz Republic has been the som (100 tyiyn = 1 som) since May 15, 1993. The
de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating arrangement. The NBKR participates and intervenes in
the interbank foreign exchange market to limit exchange rate volatility as necessary. The de facto
exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed arrangement. The NBKR publishes daily
the exchange rate of the som in terms of the U.S. dollar, which is determined in the interbank
foreign exchange market. The official exchange rate of the som against the dollar is calculated as the
daily weighted average of the exchange rates used in the purchase and sale transactions of dollars
conducted in the foreign exchange market through the Trade Information Electronic System (TIES)
of the NBKR for the reporting period from 3:00 pm of the previous trading day to 3:00 pm of the
current trading day. The government uses the official exchange rate for budget and tax accounting
purposes as well as for all payments between the government and enterprises and other legal
entities. The Kyrgyz Republic maintains a multiple currency practice (MCP), which predates the
arrangement, arising from the use of the official exchange rate for government transactions. The
official rate may differ by more than 2 percent from market rates because it is based on the average
transaction weighted rate of the preceding day. In practice, the official and market rates have never
differed by more than 2 percent. The new trading software that is currently being tested will enable
automatic matching and settlement of transactions and will eliminate the existing segmentation of
the foreign exchange market. The software is expected to be rolled out to banks over the next few
months and to remove the MCP. Staff does not recommend approval of this MCP.
The Kyrgyz Republic maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making of
payments and transfers for current international transactions, except for the MCP discussed above
and exchange restrictions maintained for security reasons relating to the restriction of financial
transactions and the freeze of accounts of certain individuals or organizations associated with
terrorism pursuant to (i) relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions; and (ii) the list of current terrorist
organizations designated by the U.S. Secretary of State. The authorities have notified these
measures to the Fund in May 2007.

Article IV consultations
The Kyrgyz Republic is on the 24-month consultation cycle. The 2013 Article IV consultation
discussions were held in March–April 2013 and were completed by the Executive Board in June
2013 (see Country Report No. 13/75).
FSAP participation and ROSC assessment
An FSAP update mission in July 2013 reviewed progress since the 2007 assessment, and the Board
discussed the Financial System Stability Assessment (FSSA) along with the fifth ECF review in
December 2013. The FSSA was not published. A fiscal ROSC mission was held in March 2001 and the
ROSC Fiscal Transparency Module was published on March 13, 2002. A data ROSC mission was held
in November 2002 and the ROSC Data Module was published in November 2003. A fiscal ROSC
reassessment was held in September 2007.
Resident representative
The tenth resident representative of the Fund in the Kyrgyz Republic is in the process of being
selected. The selected candidate should be in place early next year.

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
(As of September 28, 2015)
World Bank Group strategy: The CPF for FY14–17: The joint WB/IFC CPF was reviewed by the
Board on July 25, 2013. Its strategic goal is to help reduce extreme poverty and promote shared
prosperity through support for improved governance. This governance-oriented approach focuses
on three dimensions of the relationship between the state and the citizen, which correspond to
three broad areas of engagement—public administration and public service delivery, business
environment and investment climate, and the management of natural resources and physical
infrastructure. IFC’s role in the WBG Country partnership Strategy for the Kyrgyz Republic is to
support the development and diversification of the private sector, contributing to country’s greater
competitiveness, and improving employment opportunities.
Since the Kyrgyz Republic joined the World Bank in 1992, the Bank has approved US$1.3 billion for
International Development Association (IDA)-funded projects and Recipient Executed Trust Funds
(RETFs), out of which US$1.1 billion has been disbursed. To date, 47 IDA investment operations for
US$1 billion have been completed and closed. The Kyrgyz Active Portfolio includes 10 IDA projects
and 18 RETFs for a total amount of US$258.3 million. From 1992 until 2000, the Kyrgyz portfolio had
a significant focus on budget support; since 2001, however, there has been a gradual shift toward
investment projects till 2010. To achieve macroeconomic stability in the country after political
turmoil in April 2010, the Kyrgyz Government requested the Bank to provide budget support. There
have been three budget support operations since the July 2010 Donors Conference and the
multiyear programmatic budget support program is envisioned till FY17.
IDA financed operations: Under the CPF, the following operations were delivered in FY15: the
Electricity Supply Accountability and Reliability Improvement Project (US$25 million equivalent), the
Pasture and Livestock Management Improvement Project (US$15 million equivalent), the Third
Village Investment Project (US$12 million equivalent), and the Energy Sector Development Policy
Operation (US$24 million equivalent). The latter was not scheduled under the CPF, but was delivered
in January 2015 in response to the Kyrgyz Government request for urgent support in addressing the
recurrent winter energy shortages.
The following operations are planned to be delivered in FY16: the Governance and Competitiveness
Development Policy Operation (US$24 million equivalent), the Integrated Forest Ecosystem
Management Project (US$12 million equivalent), the Urban Development Project (US$12 million
equivalent), the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project 3 (US$13 million equivalent), and the
Integrated Dairy Productivity Improvement Project (US$5 million equivalent).
Trust funds: In addition to the IDA portfolio, the Kyrgyz program includes a significant number of
cofinancing and stand-alone trust funds (TFs). Currently, the RETFs Portfolio has a total value of
about US$95 million, out of which US$41 million has been disbursed. Three sectors—Health,
Education, and Water—receive most of the TFs. The largest trust funds are the Swiss TF for Kyrgyz

KYRGYZ REPUBLIC

RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(ADB)
(As of October 1, 2015)
The Kyrgyz Republic joined ADB in 1994. ADB approved the current Country Partnership Strategy
(CPS) 2013–17 for the Kyrgyz Republic in August 2013. The CPS is aligned with the National
Sustainable Development Strategy, 2013–17 approved by the President of the Kyrgyz Republic in
January 2013 (NSDS). The overarching goal of the CPS is poverty reduction through inclusive
economic growth. The CPS supports the government in addressing key constraints to growth and
equitable access to economic opportunities. It focuses on: (i) public sector management for private
sector development; (ii) transport and logistics, focusing on rehabilitation of a regional corridor and
maintenance of the road network.; (iii) the energy sector, focusing on rehabilitating and upgrading a
major hydropower plant, and institutional and technological reform to improve sector efficiency;
(iv) education and training, focusing on improvement of the availability and quality of a skilled
workforce, and employability of the population; and (v) water supply and sanitation (WSS),
responding to the government’s request and commitment to sector reform. ADB has been active in
these areas and within each sector will focus more strongly on addressing regional disparities. The
Country Operations Business Plan 2016–18 was endorsed by the Board in September 2015.
ADB is one of the major development partners in the country. The Kyrgyz Republic is a Group A
developing member country and has access to Asian Development Fund (ADF) resources and
concessional ordinary capital resources (OCR). The indicative ADF and concessional OCR resource
allocation for 2016–18 is US$283.8 million, including US$60.0 million from subregional pool. The
final allocation will depend on available ADF resources and concessional OCR, and the outcome of
the country performance assessments. In addition, cofinancing and funding from other sources,
including the ADF and concessional OCR subregional pool, will be explored. The 2014 debt distress
classification of the Kyrgyz Republic was assessed as moderate risk of debt distress. In accordance
with the ADF grants framework, the country is to receive 50 percent of its country allocation in
grants during 2015–16, subject to a 20 percent volume discount of the grant portion of the country
allocation. The nonlending program includes US$4.9 million of technical assistance grants for
2016–18.
As of 1 October 2015, the country has received 38 loans worth US$961.7 million, 26 ADF and one
GEF grants worth US$474.1 million. The Kyrgyz Republic has also received eight grants from Japan
Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR grants) amounting to US$8.5 million.
ADB is the largest funding agency in the transport, energy and public sector management sectors.
Four new projects, namely: Investment Climate Improvement Program, Subprogram 3 for
US$22 million, Strengthening Education System Sector Development Program and Project, for
US$10 million and US$12 million grant respectively, Toktogul Rehabilitation Phase 2 Project for
US$110 million (US$65.5 million loan and US$44.5 million grant), CAREC Transport Corridor I
(Bishkek-Torugart Road) Project 3—additional financing for US$15.1 million (US$10.8 million loan

and US$4.3 million grant) were approved in 2014. This year, CAREC Corridors 1 and 3 Connector
Road Project Design Advance (PDA) for US$3 million and a Second Investment Climate
Improvement program (ICIP), Subprogram 1 for US$20 million were approved.
As of 1 October 2015, the active portfolio included 12 projects totaling US$605.3 million which are
being implemented through 10 ADF loans (US$307.2 million) and 14 ADF grants (US$298.1 million)
and one grant financed by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction grant (US$1.5 million).
ADB has also provided 89 technical assistance (TA) projects amounting to US$51.5 million as of
today. ADB also provides TA through the regional technical assistance facility. Among the most
recent assistance is technical assistance for developing an e-procurement strategy for the Kyrgyz
Republic, Support for Strategic Assessment of the Kyrgyz Economy, and Strengthening Government
Capacity for Managing Development Projects. A project Preparatory TA for Central Asia Regional
Economic Cooperation Corridors 1 and 3 Connector Road Project for US$1 million was approved in
2015.
The year-end performance of ADB’s portfolio was satisfactory in 2014 with 78 percent projects on
track. Contract awards and disbursements as of 31 December 2014 reached US$65.94 million and
US$63.4million (86 percent and 102 percent of year’s projections), respectively.
The Kyrgyz Republic is a strong advocate for regional economic cooperation, and is an active
participant in the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) Program. The Kyrgyz
Republic has benefited significantly from regional road development. Following CAREC initiatives in
key areas approved at sector meetings, the Kyrgyz Republic is taking measures in trade policy and
trade facilitation sectors to increase trade and transport flow. The reconstructed roads ensure safer
and faster year-round travel to Kazakh, Tajik, and Chinese borders. Investments in energy will
expand energy production and distribution. CAREC transport and trade facilitation projects are
expected to support the government’s goal of developing external trade activities. ADB is also
helping to develop procedures and technical tools to enhance land acquisition and resettlement
practices to foster more effective infrastructure development in the region.
At the Thirteenth CAREC Ministerial Conference held in Bishkek in November 2014, a memorandum
of understanding was signed between the cities of Almaty and Bishkek to jointly work on
development of the Almaty—Bishkek Corridor.
By the end of 2014, cumulative direct value-added official co-financing for the Kyrgyz Republic since
1997 amounted to US$216.2 million for eight investment projects and US$3.1 million for eight
technical assistance projects.
ADB private sector operations in the Kyrgyz Republic began in 2012 with the signing of a
US$10 million SME loan to the Kyrgyz Investment and Credit Bank. ADB's Trade Finance Program
(TFP) fills market gaps in trade finance by providing guarantees and loans through over 200 partner
banks in support of trade. In December 2012, three banks in the Kyrgyz Republic signed TFP
agreements including Demir Kyrgyz International Bank, Kyrgyz Investment and Credit CJSC, RSK

Bank OJSC. In 2015, a US$10 million Senior Unsecured Loan to Bai Tushum Bank for Broadening
Access to Finance was approved.
The Kyrgyz Republic was selected as one of the pilot countries during the February 2003 Rome
Conference on Harmonization. Since then key development partners have learned to better
coordinate and harmonize procurement procedures, oversee financial management and monitoring,
share project implementation units, and conduct joint country portfolio reviews.
ADB cooperates extensively with civil society organizations in the Kyrgyz Republic to strengthen the
effectiveness, quality, and sustainability of the services it provides.

KYRGYZ REPUBLIC

RELATIONS WITH THE EUROPEAN BANK FOR
RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT (EBRD)
(As of September 30, 2015)

Overview of EBRD activities to date
The Bank has been actively supporting the transition in Kyrgyz Republic since 1995. From 1995 to
the end of September 2015, the Bank signed 128 projects accounting for a net cumulative business
volume of €516 million. The Bank’s portfolio amounted to €209 million in 54 active projects. The
current private sector portfolio ratio (as a percentage of the total portfolio) is 68 percent which is
well above the Bank’s 60 percent mandated ratio.
On 25 February 2015 the EBRD Board of Directors approved a new country strategy for the Kyrgyz
Republic which will guide the Bank’s operations in the country for the next four years. The key
strategic priorities include (i) fostering sustainable growth by strengthening regional cross-border
linkages; (ii) enabling SMEs to scale-up and bolster competitiveness; and (iii) promoting
sustainability of public utilities through commercialization and private sector participation. In
addition, the Bank will seek to support through the above priorities the reduction of regional
economic disparities, by increasing its outreach to less developed rural areas, in particular in the
southern regions, and addressing inclusion gaps in relation to gender and youth across sectors.

Fostering sustainable growth by strengthening regional cross-border linkages:
As a landlocked economy with a limited domestic market, the Kyrgyz Republic would benefit greatly
from deeper regional integration, given its important energy export potential, as well as good
regional trade and transit position. The country is engaged in several regional integration processes,
which create opportunities in terms of export markets and potential inwards investments.


In that context, the Bank aims to help facilitate economic and trade cooperation and integration
with the region, by supporting rehabilitation of critical infrastructure. In 2014 and 2015 the Bank
completed physical implementation of US$35 million project to rehabilitate a section of
Osh-Isfana road, an important trade and transport corridor in the Fergana valley and has been
exploring opportunities for further involvement in the road sector.



The Bank helped local SMEs to develop export potential by providing direct business advice
involving both local and international consultants, organizing specialized seminars, trainings to
promote trade finance instruments and equip consultant with much needed knowledge on
export promotion.



The Bank continued its engagement with the government on public procurement improvement
under the joint EBRD–UNCITRAL technical cooperation project designed to upgrade public
procurement regulation in the CIS to the new UNCITRAL Model Law on Procurement of Goods,
Construction, and Services. The Bank continues working with the government on helping to

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KYRGYZ REPUBLIC

open negotiations and join the GPA to comply with requirements of both WTO and Eurasian
Economic Union in terms of public procurement.

Enabling SMEs to scale-up and bolster competitiveness:
The Bank’s operations in support of local SMEs took advantage of the ETC Initiative and recently
created SME Department, which was instrumental in enabling the Bank to deliver a number of small
projects with significant transition impact, particularly in the areas of corporate governance and
business conduct. In 2014 and first nine months of 2015 the Bank signed nine corporate sector
projects all with local SMEs.


Under the Direct Finance Facility, in 2014 the Bank financed a local retail chain to support
expansion and improve shop conditions; and a local property and hotel developer to complete
the major construction and refurbishment works.



Under the Risk-sharing Facility (RFF), jointly with local partner banks the Bank supported
expansion to Jalalabad of one of the leading flour producing companies; financed two local
construction companies, one to invest into expansion of its stone crushing and mortar product
lines to increase efficiency and ensure acceptable product quality, and another to increase own
fleet to maintain a continuous raw materials supply; financed one of the largest manufacturing
enterprises in the country supplying radiators and other spare parts to its partners in Russia and
Kazakhstan helping to improve health and safety standards at the site as well as modernize
production facilities; supported a local resort to help modernize its wastewater treatment facility
with the aim to reduce energy consumption and improve the resort’s area and facilities;
provided financing to a local fuel trader to expand the network of fuel stations across the
country; and supported a local producer of confectionery in the southern area to refurbish its
manufacturing workshop.



Improving access to finance by developing local financial sector remained a priority for the Bank
in supporting SMEs. In 2014–15 the Bank signed ten new loan agreements with local banks and
MFIs, including eight loan agreements in local currency as part of the Bank’s Local Currency and
Local Capital Market Initiative, a risk-sharing program supported by donor grants to catalyze
local currency lending in the early transition countries (ETC). In September 2015 EBRD has
approved US$33 million financing package to OptimaBank, the largest bank in the country. This
includes credit line for support of MSMEs, limits opened under Trade Facilitation Program and
Risk–sharing Facility.



Loans to local financial institutions also included the energy efficiency credit lines to four
participating financial institutions provided under the US$20 million Kyrgyz Sustainable Energy
Efficiency Facility (KyrSEFF) which is an example of an integrated approach combining policy
dialogue, financing and TC-supported capacity building at local intermediaries, benefiting from
donor-funded investment incentives. KyrSEFF offers to provide financing for small-size energy
efficiency improvements in the residential, service, agribusiness, SME, and industry sectors.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

KYRGYZ REPUBLIC

Based on the success of KyrSEFF, EBRD works on mobilizing additional US$35 million of credit
resources to be directed for energy efficiency but also water efficiency and management.


The Bank also engaged in policy dialogue with the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic (NBKR)
on supporting development of mobile banking regulation, and strengthening the NBKR capacity
in monetary policy implementation (inflation targeting TC Program). Jointly with KfW, the Bank
initiated a technical assistance project to support further development of the local capital
market.



Small Business Support (SBS) connects small and medium-sized enterprises to the expertise that
can help transform their businesses. Depending on the nature of the company’s needs, SBS
works by providing business advice, supporting short-term specific projects with local
consultants, or through industry expertise, using longer-term projects that help senior managers
develop new business skills and make the structural changes their companies need to thrive.

12



SBS works with international advisers with more than 15 years’ experience in a
particular industry or field. In visits over the course of 12–18 months, the advisers
strive to transfer their know-how to receptive managers. The teaching of
international best practices is tailored to the needs of the client, and can cover
anything from restructuring, to marketing and design or financial management. SBS
has undertaken 55 projects in the Kyrgyz Republic with companies in
manufacturing, ICT, tourism, and agriculture. The majority of projects focused on
improving marketing and sales, organization, operations, and financial
management. The total donor commitment for these projects was approximately
€3.2 million.



SBS helps companies work with qualified local consultants on a range of projects,
covering concerns from market research to strategic planning, quality management
and certification or energy efficiency and environmental management. These
projects are undertaken on a cost-sharing basis. SBS also work with the local
consultancy sector, supporting professional capacity building to develop the skills
of local consultants to enable them to serve the SME sector on a sustainable basis,
and to introduce more sophisticated advisory services in areas such as quality
management and energy efficiency. As of 23 September 2015, SBS Kyrgyz Republic
has undertaken 893 projects, engaging 202 consultants. More than 65 percent of
the enterprises assisted are located outside the main cities. Despite the difficult
business climate, turnover increased in nearly 66 percent of SBS beneficiary
companies in the year following project completion, while 57 beneficiaries secured
external investments, for a total investment of €31 million. SBS Kyrgyz Republic is
funded by the Swiss and the U.S. Governments and the EBRD Shareholders Special
Fund which have contributed €4.5 million, €0.7 and €1 million respectively.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KYRGYZ REPUBLIC

Promoting sustainability of public utilities through commercialization and private sector
participation:
To build the institutional framework for sustainable operations of municipal services, the Bank
strengthened its activities in municipal infrastructure projects and worked on implementation of a
€20 million framework to improve water supply and wastewater treatment supported by
co-financing grants from bilateral and multilateral donors. The framework was fully utilized by the
end of 2014. In 2015 the Bank extended the original framework by approving new €20 million to
cover additional sub-projects in the following cities: Naryn, Batken, Cholpon-Ata, Balykchi, Karakol,
Kara-Suu, Uzgen, Kizil-Kiya, Toktogul, Mailu-Suu and second phases of water projects in Osh,
Jalal-Abad and Talas.


Under this framework, the Bank signed new water and wastewater projects for Tokmok, Naryn
and Batken in 2015. The new loans in total amount of €5.5 million (€2.0 million for Tokmok,
€2.0 million for Naryn and €1.5 million for Batken) are co-financed by capital grants in total
amount of €8.8 million (€3.1 million for Tokmok, €3.2 million for Naryn and €2.5 million for
Batken) from the European Union’s Investment Facility for Central Asia (EU IFCA), Swiss State
Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) and the EBRD Shareholder Special Fund (SSF)
respectively for Tokmok, Naryn and Batken and will be used to finance critical water and
wastewater infrastructure improvements in these cities. The capital expenditure grants are
required to meet conditions for non-concessional lending and mitigate affordability constraints.
Projects in the water sector enabled the Bank to make progress with water tariff reforms,
implementing IFRS accounting standards, and promoting efficiency in the water companies.



In 2015 the EBRD declared effective the €11 million loan to finance critical solid waste
investments in Bishkek, which is the first project supporting solid waste management in the
country. The loan is co-financed by €3 million capital grant from the Bank’s Shareholder Special
Fund (SSF) and €8 million from the EU IFCA. The project is expected to improve the city’s solid
waste management, including collection across the city, investment in an urgently needed
sanitary landfill, and the closure of the existing dumpsite, which is at the end of its economic life.
The project will help optimize solid waste collection including via acquisition of new trucks and
containers and is expected to result in an improved level of public service, the introduction of
waste recycling and environmental improvements. In addition substantial TC has been mobilized
to assist the Bishkek municipality with development and implementation of resettlement and
livelihood restoration in connection with the existing landfill. By end of 2015 the Bank intends to
provide new loans of €3.5 million in total to finance critical solid waste investments in Osh and
Jalal-Abad cities. The Bank loans will be co-financed by €7 million loans from the European
Investment Bank and €9 million capital grants from EU IFCA.



The Bank continued implementation of the Bishkek Public Transport project with 79 new
high- and low-floor trolleybuses delivered to Bishkek by the end of 2014 and in the same year
provided a new loan of €5.7 million for improvement of public transport system in the City of
Osh. The loan was co-financed by €3.1 million capital grant from EBRD Shareholder Special
Fund. For all municipal projects gender was taken into consideration with respect to improving
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

KYRGYZ REPUBLIC

equality of access to the new services. By the end of 2015 the Bank intends to provide additional
loan of €5 million in total to finance the second phase of the Bishkek Public Transport project for
procurement of additional up to 60 new trolleybuses. The Bank loan will be co-financed by
€3.4 million capital grant from EBRD SSF.

Policy dialogue:
EBRD is continuing support to the Business Development and Investment Council, which has been
providing local and international business representatives (representing the mining, industry,
agro-processing and tourism sectors) with a platform to discuss the main barriers to doing business
with top officials of the government.


The Bank continued to actively engage in policy dialogue with the government and local
authorities to promote the further reform agenda in corporate and infrastructure sectors, in
particular transport sector (road maintenance and financing) reform.



The Bank is providing support to the development of local capital markets through policy
dialogue, TC deepening the market, and reducing financial institutions’ funding mismatches,
including in local currency.



The Bank has been working on implementing TC to provide institutional capacity building
support to the State Agency for Geology to support mining sector reform.



The Bank continues its support for renewable energy development including through TC to the
Ministry of Energy and Industry to support the renewable energy framework, and a possible
financing of a pilot mini-hydro project(s).



The Bank continued policy dialogue with the authorities and utility companies to improve
employment opportunities and HR practices affecting women, youth and regional populations in
utility and public transport. An initial study of impediments for creating equal opportunities for
women’s employment in the mining sector has been produced which suggested a need for
changes to be further discussed with the authorities.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Data provision is adequate for surveillance. The four institutions responsible for collecting,
compiling and disseminating macroeconomic statistics—the National Statistics Committee (NSC),
the Ministry of Economy and Industry, the Ministry of Finance, and the NBKR—have legal and
institutional environments that support statistical quality, and their respective staff are well-versed in
current methodologies.
2.
The NSC maintains a comprehensive and regularly updated website with data that largely
incorporate international methodological recommendations with adequate coverage and timeliness
(http://www.stat.kg). In February 2004, the Kyrgyz Republic subscribed to the SDDS.
3.
A data ROSC mission in November 2002 concluded that the quality of the macroeconomic
statistics had improved significantly in the last few years. The authorities’ response to the data ROSC
(posted on the IMF website www.imf.org/external/np/rosc) includes an update on the status of
implementation of the ROSC recommendations.
National accounts
4.
In general, dissemination of national accounts statistics is timely. Technical assistance has
been received from the IMF, EUROSTAT, OECD, the World Bank, and bilateral donors. While
significant progress has been made in improving the national accounts estimation process,
problems persist regarding the quality of the source data, due mainly to excessively tight collection
deadlines associated with the release schedule. Efforts are needed to improve the quality of the
source data for quarterly GDP estimates. Moreover, while the quarterly GDP estimates are
disseminated on a discrete basis for SDDS purposes, these estimates are still derived from
cumulative data. Difficulties also remain in properly estimating the degree of underreporting,
especially in the private sector. To improve the coverage and reliability of primary data, work has
been undertaken to introduce sampling procedures. Improved sampling procedures have been
adopted for household surveys and new report forms have been introduced for the enterprise
survey. The NSC has established a division of sample surveys, which would assist in improving the
sampling techniques.
5.
The November 2008 STA mission on national accounts assisted the staff of the National
Accounts Division in NCS to produce discrete quarterly GDP estimates at current and constant
prices, using both the production and expenditure approaches. The mission made a number of
recommendations, including: (a) need to introduce the new establishment surveys; (b) disseminate
the industrial production index (IPI) as a chain-linked indices, in line with international standards;
(c) investigate the inconsistency between the IPI and the producer price index (PPI); (d) fully
computerize the calculation of volume estimates for agriculture in line with international practice;
and (e) obtain time series data for loans and deposits of financial institutions.

Price and labor market statistics
6.
The concepts and definitions used in the CPI, which has been published since January 1995,
are broadly consistent with international standards. The price index covers all urban resident
households of all sizes and income levels, but needs to cover rural households, which comprise the
majority of the population.
7.
The PPI, which has been published since October 1996, is compiled broadly in accordance
with international standards, although its coverage needs to be improved. The coverage of the PPI
was broadened in May 1997 and is expected to be further expanded in the coming years.
8.
Progress has been made in computing unit value indices for imports and exports. Work
continues with regard to computation of these indices using a standard index presentation and the
development of an export price index. However, problems in customs administration have led to
incomplete coverage of trade and the lack of an appropriate valuation system. Moreover, the data
processed by customs have suffered due to the use of an outdated computer software system.
9.
Problems exist in the compilation of the average wage, especially with respect to the
valuation of payments in kind and the coverage of the private sector. Monthly and annual data are
not comparable because of different coverage and classifications. These problems extend to
employment data as well. The coverage of unemployment includes an estimate of unregistered
unemployed.
Government finance statistics
10.
The scope of central government statistics falls short of international standards because it
excludes data for the Social Fund (these data are published separately). Other limitations involve the
discrepancies between the deficit and financing data. While revenue and expenditure data generally
accord with the GFSM 1986, there are misclassifications in both categories (for example, some
nontax revenues are classified as taxes, and certain expenditure items are misclassified in the budget
and treasury accounts). Monthly GFS data are reported to STA for publication in the IFS; the latest
data reported for publication in the GFS Yearbook were for 2006 and covered general government
and its subsectors; and the data were compiled using the GFSM 2001 analytical framework.
11.
The provision of data on public external debt service has improved. Data on actual debt
service, guaranteed debt service, outstanding debt, and revised debt projections are provided on a
monthly basis. The quality (including timeliness) of external debt data is adequate. The External Debt
Division of the ministry of finance is now solely responsible for monitoring external debt, and has
benefited from on-site training provided by a Swiss-financed long-term consultant and the
computerization of its database.

Monetary and financial statistics (MFS)
12.
The MFS Technical Assistance (TA) mission visited the Kyrgyz Republic in April 2015 and
assisted the National Bank of Kyrgyz Republic (NBKR) in migrating to the IMF recommended
Standardized Report Forms (SRFs). The pilot data SRF 1SR for the NBKR and SRF 2SR for other
depository corporations (which currently include operational commercial banks only) were
developed and submitted to STA for review. STA identified classification and sectorization issues in
the reported SRF data, which were communicated to the authorities. The data will be published in
International Financial Statistics as soon as these issues are resolved. Another MFS TA mission is
planned for FY2016 which will focus on extending a coverage of SRF 2SR by including other deposit
taking institutions as well as developing SRF 4SR for other financial corporations.
13.
The NBKR submitted pilot data on Financial Soundness Indicators (FSIs) to STA. STA works
with the NBKR to bring FSIs compilation practice in line with those outlined in the FSIs Compilation
Guide.
External sector statistics
14.
Data on the balance of payments and international investment position (IIP) are compiled
and disseminated on a quarterly basis. The Kyrgyz Republic is one of the three beneficiary countries
that are covered by the 18-months project on improving external sector statistics (ESS) finance by
the Switzerland Government (SECO). Two technical assistance (TA) missions in ESS have been
conducted during 2015 within SECO project. The missions noted that the compilation of balance of
payments and IIP statistics broadly follows the methodology recommended in the BPM5; however,
their coverage, compilation techniques, temporal consistency, and timeliness needed improvement.
A specific concern wais the accuracy of private sector external debt statistics. With the missions’
assistance, the BPM6 was implemented on an experimental basis for balance of payments for
Q1–Q2, 2015 and the reporting of external debt data for all institutional sectors to the World Bank
Quarterly External Debt Statistics database was resumed. While progress had been made in several
areas, further improvements are needed in foreign direct investment, estimation of shuttle trade,
and in remittances. Specific concerns are regarding the adjustment of trade statistics to the
requirements of Custom Union (CU) whose member the Kyrgyz Republic became in 2015. There is
need to reconcile the customs declarations database for the trade with CU members and with the
rest of the world.

Statement by Daniel Heller, Executive Director for Kyrgyz Republic
and Mr. Imashov, and Mr. Waelti, Advisors to Executive Director
December 4, 2015
On behalf of our Kyrgyz authorities, we would like to thank management and staff for their
continued support to the Kyrgyz Republic through the three-year arrangement under the
Extended Credit Facility (ECF). The authorities are highly appreciative of the Fund’s steady
engagement with them and broadly agree with staff’s assessment and policy recommendations.
In a turbulent regional economic context, the Fund program provides a solid framework for the
design, prioritization, and implementation of sound policies to support the economy in the short
term, as well as to lift its potential and enhance its resilience in the long term. Ultimately,
preserving macroeconomic stability and putting economic growth on a higher trajectory are
essential to sustain social stability and to achieve permanent gains in the fight against poverty.
Against this background, the authorities remain strongly committed to the set of measures
agreed under the Fund program. Program implementation has been strong. All end-June 2015
quantitative performance criteria and all indicative targets were met. For the most part, structural
benchmarks for this review were met. On this basis, the authorities request the completion of the
first review and the related disbursement in the amount of SDR 9.514 million.
Recent economic developments
The turbulent regional economic context is taking a toll on the Kyrgyz economy. The economic
slowdown in major trading partners has contributed to lowering exports and has also slashed
remittances, an important source of foreign exchange and driver of domestic demand.
Remittances are equivalent to almost one third of GDP. In the first nine months of this year,
remittances decreased by 28 percent (y-o-y) in USD terms. The knock-on effect on the som
from the depreciations of other regional currencies and the appreciation of the US dollar
elevates the risks to the financial sector and has contributed to the higher-than expected level of
public external debt. Overall, this wave of external shocks sharpens some of the policy tradeoffs faced by the authorities and complicates macroeconomic policy management.
In this difficult external environment, economic growth will remain modest in 2015 due to a
decrease in gold production and despite relatively good results in the rest of the economy.
Year-on-year inflation slowed down from 10.5 percent in December 2014 to 6.4 percent in
September 2015 due mainly to lower food prices. The favorable state of world food markets, the

2
good harvest in the Kyrgyz Republic along with tight monetary policy resulted in an inflation
rate of 1.1 percent on a cumulative basis for the first nine months of 2015. The benefits from
lower fuel import prices were partially offset by the depreciation of the som against the US
dollar. The National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic (NBKR) has maintained a tight monetary
policy and allowed the exchange rate to adjust to external shocks, limiting its interventions to
smoothing excessive fluctuations.
The authorities will ensure that the end-of-year fiscal deficit is in line with the program target.
Their second supplementary budget targets an overall deficit of 3.7 percent of GDP.
However, it is expected that through frugal budget execution, the deficit will be brought down to
3.5 percent of GDP.
The Kyrgyz Republic officially became a member of the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU) on
August 12, 2015. The Russia-Kyrgyz Development Fund has started its operations. So far, the
Russian Federation has disbursed USD 300 million to overcome the structural changes caused
by the new trade regime, to enhance the access to credit for the private sector, and to support the
Kyrgyz economy.
Fiscal policy: a balancing act geared towards fiscal consolidation and maintaining debt
sustainability
The authorities remain committed to resume fiscal consolidation in 2016 to maintain public debt
at a sustainable level, as planned at the time of the program request. For the remainder of this
year, program commitments will be met by streamlining expenditures as needed and by
avoiding new recurring spending unless these are financed by new permanent revenue measures.
The budget for 2016 is being prepared in line with program targets, through a combination of
revenue measures and further expenditure streamlining, including a reduction of the wage bill
and refraining from ad hoc wage increases. While the overall balance will deteriorate due to the
postponement of some PIP projects from 2015 to 2016, an operating surplus of
5.9 percent of GDP is targeted. To meet this target, a fiscal effort of at least 1.6 percentage
points of GDP will be undertaken, excluding expected EEU customs revenues which should be
saved to gradually rebuild thin fiscal buffers.
Education is a powerful driver of development and one of the most effective instruments for
reducing poverty and improving health, gender equality, peace, and social stability. To this end,

3
the authorities have decided to dedicate the USD 100 million windfall revenue from the sale of a
gold mine to the improvement of existing schools and the construction of new schools in remote
areas, as a national commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals.
Given the fact that the salary of teachers was around USD 80 per month, the Kyrgyz authorities
also decided to increase it to USD 120 on average.
To ensure that the increase of teachers’ salaries stays budget neutral, a number of revenue
measures will be implemented such as upgrading the mechanisms of accruing and paying certain
types of non tax payments, strengthening the administration of the VAT to reduce tax evasion
and broaden the tax base, and raising excise taxes as part of the process of harmonization with
EEU rules.
The authorities remain fully committed to maintaining public external debt at a sustainable level
over the medium term. In the period ahead, to that effect, an action plan will be introduced to
improve the quality and the efficiency of the public investment process.
Furthermore, among other measures, the authorities will revise their Medium Term Debt
Strategy in line with the outcome of the new debt sustainability analysis. The authorities intend
to refrain from nonconcessional borrowing and request an indicative target of zero
nonconcessional borrowing to that effect, in addition to the quantitative performance criterion
on the present value of new external debt contracted or guaranteed.
Monetary and financial sector policies
Monetary policy will continue to focus on containing inflation within the target range. As in the
past, the NBKR will maintain a positive policy rate in real terms and stands ready to adjust its
level in response to inflationary and exchange rate pressures. Foreign exchange interventions
will continue to be used only to smooth excessive fluctuations. Their tightening impact will be
carefully monitored to avoid unduly restricting credit growth and damaging growth prospects.
The authorities will further pursue their efforts to preserve financial sector stability and reduce
dollarization through market-based measures. They are analyzing the impact of the
macroprudential measures introduced in May 2015 with a view to fine-tuning them as needed.
To address the challenges arising from exchange rate volatility, higher reserve requirements
were set on foreign exchange deposits. In addition, the authorities stand ready to consider and
introduce regulation to restrict foreign exchange lending to borrowers with less than 50 percent
of their income in foreign currency.

4

The authorities remain committed to make every effort to work with the newly elected
Parliament to enact the Banking Law in a form substantially similar to the draft that was initially
submitted to Parliament. Once the Banking Law is implemented, it will contribute substantially
to the strengthening of the Kyrgyz financial system.
Meanwhile, banking sector supervision is being further strengthened by developing a strategic
plan to build supervisory capacity and to provide for a robust supervisory program, including
risk based supervision. A crisis simulation exercise will be conducted by March
2016 and a crisis preparedness framework will be developed together with the Ministry of
Finance and the Deposit Protection Agency by September 2016. The model for macrofinancial
stress testing will be enhanced, and banks will be closely monitored, particularly those with a
large exposure to trade, construction, mortgage and consumer loans.
While the audit of DEBRA could not be completed as expected, the authorities remain fully
committed to completing this audit. Progress has been made and an auditor has been appointed
(prior action). This auditor has been tasked to complete its work by March 2016.
Structural and institutional reforms to strengthen long-term growth
The Kyrgyz authorities are well aware of the importance of further improving the business
environment, a key pillar of sustainable and inclusive growth. This issue was stressed by the
President of the Kyrgyz Republic, Mr. Atambaev, during the opening ceremony of the first
session of the newly elected parliament.
Improving the business and investment climate is crucial to strengthen long-term growth in
general, and to reap the full benefits from EEU membership in particular. A review of the tax
regime will be undertaken to ensure simplicity, fairness and equal treatment of all tax payers.
The new government has committed to put all its efforts to find a mutually beneficial resolution
of the dispute with Centerra, based on high environmental and social standards, to prevent any
disruption in gold production. The Kyrgyz authorities are deeply aware of the fact that a stable
and predictable investment climate with proper contract enforcement, as well as less red tape
and corruption, are essential for attracting investment and spurring private sector-led growth.
The authorities will continue their efforts to reform the energy sector with the aim of improving
service delivery and putting it on sound economic footing. As such, these reforms will reduce

5
the sector’s fiscal burden and, maybe even more importantly, help improving the business
environment by facilitating access.
The authorities remain devoted to implementing the EEU commitments for promoting trade
with regional countries. They will continue to pursue greater regional economic and social
integration, and to advocate further steps to open up the country with a view to enhancing
competition and efficiency.
Conclusion
The Kyrgyz authorities are fully aware that the key near-term challenge is to maintain
macroeconomic stability and to put the financial sector on a sound footing. The authorities also
agree that key medium-term priorities include diversifying the economy away from gold,
reducing dependence on remittances and external support, and creating a business environment
conducive to private sector-led growth. This position will be reflected in the overarching
National Sustainable Development Strategy for the next decade.
