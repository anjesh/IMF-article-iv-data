EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
After a long boom, Sweden was amongst the first to falter in the great recession-output fell 5 percent in 2009, and unemployment rose to over 9 percent. The downturn
was mitigated by aggressive stabilization policies, led by a sharp relaxation of
monetary policy, a slew of emergency financial sector support measures, and actions
raising bank capital. Alongside, a fiscal relaxation of 3 percentage points of GDP to a
deficit of 0.8 percent of GDP in 2009 supported demand. All these actions were
accompanied by a 15 percent real effective depreciation of the krona. These policies
have yielded fruit: as globally, earlier financial strains have eased and exit from
emergency financial sector support measures has begun. In this context, output began
to rise from mid-2009.
Nevertheless, prospects for growth in 2010–11 remain uncertain, including as a result
of market stress in Europe which has both dented export market growth prospects and
reversed much of the earlier krona depreciation.
Accordingly, the authorities’ intentions to keep policies supportive are appropriate.
Fiscal policy anchors this effort, with the overall deficit projected to widen to over
2 percent of GDP in 2010. If economic growth and employment turn out to be stronger
than anticipated, the budget balance will do likewise. And the tax reductions in
the 2009–10 budgets will help to boost structural flexibility. The independent Swedish
Fiscal Policy Council has endorsed these plans. Alongside, even as a cautious
tightening cycle is anticipated, the monetary stance is set to remain highly
accommodative, with inflation set to decline given the large output gap and recent
krona strength. And continued uncertainty over the implications of market strains in
Europe could provide grounds to consider the appropriate timing for the
commencement in the anticipated tightening cycle.
Financial stability remains under close surveillance. Given improved domestic and
Baltic prospects, Core Tier 1 capital ratios for all large banks will remain above
8 percent even in a stress scenario. And the Financial Supervisory Authority’s proposal
to penalize loan-to-value ratios above 85 percent will help to address housing market
vulnerabilities. Nevertheless, risks remain, including those from banking operations
abroad and from liquidity risks in euro and dollar markets. These elements should
continue to be reflected in Swedish capital and liquidity requirements in line with
forthcoming global agreements on such arrangements. Ability to manage tail risks
should also remain under active review. While direct exposures to Euro Area
peripherals are minimal, Sweden is exposed indirectly. Thus, a priority is to update
“war games” to verify contingency plans. These would also provide a useful
opportunity to confirm that international reserves are at appropriate levels. And steps to
establish a special resolution regime to manage troubled financial institutions and to
further raise resources for banking supervision are welcome.

Riksbank did not apply discretionary intervention in foreign exchange markets, thereby
accommodating krona depreciation, the National Debt Office borrowed externally SEK
100 billion (US dollars 15 billion) to boost international reserves and the Riksbank tapped
U.S. Federal Reserve and ECB’s currency swap arrangements.

On the fiscal side, the budget balance swung from a surplus of 2½ percent of GDP
in 2008 to a deficit of 0.8 percent of GDP in 2009, delivering 3.3 percentage points of GDP
in support to demand (Text chart, Figure 4).

As elsewhere, discretionary measures to avert a significant rise in unemployment
were also put in place, albeit on a smaller scale than elsewhere. Active labor market policies
were strengthened and upgraded through job search assistance and training (Text chart).

Box 1. Seasonal Adjustment of Real Output
Tracking quarterly output developments during the downturn has been difficult.
Distinguishing outliers from new information about seasonality that is contained in each new
data round has proved challenging for statisticians, compounded in Sweden’s case by rebasing
the reference year to the chained-volume method—to 2008 with the May 6 data release and
to 2009 with the May 28 data release. As a result, the reported quarterly shape of the downturn
and the timing of recovery have changed significantly across data releases (Text chart).

To assess the latest release of quarterly data for the years to 2010Q1, staff re-estimated
seasonally adjusted GDP data using fixed seasonal factors, based on the estimated seasonality
up to 2006Q3—the last period for which estimation using Statistics Sweden’s 2-year ahead
and 2-year behind method of estimating seasonality is unaffected by the global downturn
in 2008 (Text chart). This confirms the broad shape of the recession as reported in the latest
release of data, but suggests that it started a little later.

Since 1993, a successful fiscal consolidation—
expenditure has been reduced by
about 19 percentage points of GDP, to
50 percent of GDP in 2007, and the general
government debt to GDP has fallen from 70 to
40 percent of GDP—has taken place. This has
underpinned and reflected the credibility of its
framework of fiscal rules, which has included
an independent fiscal policy council
since 2007.

Projections for public debt in the next 5 years
remain below 45 percent of GDP, even in
relatively adverse macroeconomic circumstances and further out, the burden of age-related
spending is low (resulting from a radical pension reform in the late 1990s). And even under
the most pessimistic estimates of such costs, the discounted net worth of the government
remains positive. (See, 2008 Article IV Consultation Report).

to account for half of the over performance on
the budget balance, compounded by larger than expected returns on reforms of various
entitlement programs. Labor market reforms to increase participation rates (such as the

The cumulative structural fiscal stimulus
to 2010, net of savings in sick leave and

1.8 percent of GDP. Absent further announced
measures, it appears on staff estimates set to
increase further in 2011. But consistency with
the balance-over-the cycle target remains
underpinned by the reductions in medium-term
spending ceilings.

Box 3. The Status of Crisis Intervention Measures

Measures

Status

Measures to increase krona liquidity
Policy rate. Since October 2008, the repo rate was cut by 450 basis points to 0.25 percent.

Active.

Collateral policy. The Riksbank expanded a collateral policy framework by fully accepting covered
bonds and lowering the minimum credit rating requirements for long-term securities pledged as
collateral.

Active.

Term loan facility. The Riksbank set up new 3, 6, and 12-month loan facilities to facilitate banks’
access to longer-term funds.

Discontinued and replaced by 28day loan facility with a penalty rate
(April 2010).

Temporary commercial paper facility. The Riksbank established a new temporary credit facility using
commercial paper as collateral (with a maturity of up to one year) to facilitate the supply of credit for
non-financial companies.

Discontinued (September 3, 2009)

Issuance of treasury bills to invest the funds raised in covered bonds to boost covered (mortgage)
bond market.

Discontinued (February, 2009)

Emergency liquidity assistance. The Riksbank granted emergency liquidity assistance to Kaupthing
Bank Sverige AB and Carnegie Investment Bank AB (both SEK 5 billion). Later, Kaupthing Bank was
liquidated, while the licensing of Carnegie Investment Bank BA was revoked.

All repaid by March 2009.

Measures to increase foreign exchange liquidity
Foreign exchange swap facilities. The Riksbank and U.S. Fed set up temporary reciprocal swap
facilities ($30 billion). A separate swap facility was also established with the ECB.

With the Fed discontinued
(February 1, 2010); with the ECB,
active.

Dollar term loan facilities. A new dollar term loan facilities (with the maturity of 28 and 84 days) were
offered.

Discontinued (November 19,
2009).

Measures to support banks’ capital and assure market confidence
Deposit insurance. On October 6, 2008, The deposit guarantee was raised from SEK 250,000 to SEK
500,000, and the coverage was broadened to include all types of deposit in accounts.

Active. Expected to be raised to
SEK 1 million by end-2010.

Government guarantee scheme. In October 2008, the government approved a debt guarantee scheme
for the medium-term borrowing of banks and mortgage institutions. The total amount of guarantee was
set at SEK 1.5 trillion. An institution applying to the guarantee would pay fees and be subject to
restrictions on remuneration for senior management.

Scheduled to be discontinued at
end-April 2010 but extended to endJune 2010, and further to end2010.

Government recapitalization scheme. The recapitalization scheme is intended for banks and other
credit institutions. The government’s capital takes the form of shares or hybrid capital (Tier 1 capital).
Participating institutions are subject to restrictions on remuneration for senior management.

Scheduled to be discontinued on
February 17, 2011.

A new bank resolution scheme. In October 2008, the government enacted “Government Support to
Credit Institutions Act” which gives the National Debt Office power to take over a troubled bank if there
is a serious systemic risk and bank capital falls below 25 percent of the regulatory requirement.

Active.

A stabilization fund. This was to finance government measures to support the financial system (the
sources of the funds are annual fees from banks and other credit institutions).

Active.

On the financial stability side, the deposit guarantee was doubled and extended to all
types of deposits, new bank recapitalization and debt guarantee schemes were introduced,
supervisory liaison with those in the region was intensified, while several banks, including
those with the largest Baltic exposures, made rights issues and stopped dividend payments to
raise capital positions well above prudential requirements (Text Figure). The authorities also
launched a review of their framework for bank regulation and supervision. A modest bank
stability charge, levied on banks non-equity liabilities has been introduced (¶55). This will
eventually form a fund of 2 percent of GDP available to finance bank rescues.

Measures of competitiveness which compare prices directly (as opposed to tracking
relative inflation rates over time) suggest that the equilibrium rate for the krona is
weaker than RER measures imply.

competitiveness by that margin.



Sweden produces consumer durables and investment goods, the long run global
demand for which has likely fallen as a result of the recent crisis. Thus, an equilibrating
depreciation is likely needed as a result of the global crisis. While the MB and ES
measures should reflect this via medium-term trade projections, the latter are subject to
considerable uncertainties in the current global context.



Alongside other indicators, notably the moderate level of inflation expectations and
weak exports, the staff assessment is that the currency is probably not very
significantly undervalued.

Output began to rise from mid-2009, although it still remains well below capacity.
Personal consumption also held up, in part due to the buoyant housing market, growing
through 2009 after the modest fall in 2008—a major stabilizing factor. Personal savings rates
fell slightly, after a long secular upward trend in recent years which reflected earlier pension
reform, while personal incomes remained buoyed by the moderate declines of employment
and wages, and supplements to income from budget transfers.
9.
Firms hoarded labor to a far greater extent (without extensive government support)
than in the 1990s—temporary jobs (one-sixth of total) fell 10 percent but have already risen
significantly since late-2009, while permanent jobs fell only moderately—albeit at the
expense of labor productivity. The Spring 2010 round of multi-year wage settlements—
covering most of the private and public sector labor force—have settled on rises of some
2½ percent, easing prospective cost pressures.
10.
The export sector, including exports of manufacturing goods that were severely hit
during the recession, has rebounded since late-2009. New orders for industry and exports
have strengthened in recent months, supporting the strong growth recorded in 2010Q1.
11.
Concerns that downturn might prompt a deflationary cycle have receded (Figure 7).
Measures of underlying inflation remained in positive territory even as the headline measure
(reflecting interest rate cuts and falling global energy prices) went negative for a time.
Measures of inflation expectations—over all horizons—have remained anchored within the
inflation target range.

And house prices rebounded significantly. The drop of some 10 percent—which by
some measures still left houses moderately overvalued—ended in early 2009 and then
reversed.2 This reflected the stimulus of low interest rates—which also produced a marked
increase in the share of new variable rate mortgages—the resilience of credit to households,
and constraints on new housing supply.

II. OUTLOOK AND RISKS
The external environment remains highly uncertain
13.
As a small open economy, with deep external financial sector linkages, Sweden is
highly exposed. External trade comprises over 90 percent of GDP, and direct foreign
exposures, including to the Baltics, comprise half of its major banking group’s assets—which
itself is 350 percent of GDP.
14.
In this context, economic growth
projections in the recent World Economic
Outlook (WEO) for the European Union remain
low relative to market consensus, at 1 percent
and 1.3 percent for 2010 and 2011, respectively,
and they note downside risks. Although the
outlook in the Baltics has improved, the ultimate
fallout on credit impairment there remains
unclear.

15.
And the global outlook, in which the European outlook is nested, remains subject to
high uncertainties. The 90 percent confidence interval around central-case WEO projections
remains very wide, with the lower bound even falling in 2011 (Text chart). Accordingly, the
lower bound of staff’s growth projections declines in 2011 before picking up in the medium
term.
16.
As contracting demand for consumer durables, and investment and intermediate
goods led the global recession, Sweden was particularly exposed as these are goods in which
it specializes (Text charts). As noted in the 2009 Article IV consultation for Sweden, these
output composition factors will also affect the outlook: if the global demand for these goods
lags the global recovery—as may be anticipated given large global output gaps and balance
sheet and fiscal adjustments in advanced economies––demand for Swedish exports may
disappoint relative to its peers in the medium-term. And the short term growth momentum
abroad and in Sweden is also qualified somewhat because a significant part of the upturn
reflects firms rebuilding inventories.

Uncertainties about export prospects are
compounded by the termination of various
global stimulus measures with particular impact
on durables and investment-related spending.3 If
global “self sustaining” aggregate demand has
not resumed by the time these measures expire,
Sweden is particularly exposed.

Sweden’s flexible exchange rate could
provide a buffer, supporting activity even if
some of these adverse risks materialize, but the
market stress in Europe has prompted a “search for strong sovereigns” that potentially
increases capital inflows into Sweden, reversing much of the earlier krona depreciation. If
this continues, prospects for net exports and growth will be dented.

19.
These uncertainties are reflected in the authorities’ output projections (¶48). The
Riksbank projects output growth of 2.2 percent, but with a 90 percent confidence interval
ranging from a fall of 1 percent to growth of 5 percent.
20.
In the staff central case, supported by global conditions, export volumes are expected
to grow by some 5 percent in 2010 and 4 percent in 2011 (Text chart). But given
considerable excess domestic capacity, fixed investment will remain weak even if export
growth is strong, and household consumption is not likely to drive growth strongly, with
permanent employment projected to grow slowly. And the impetus to growth may be
attenuated if the krona continues to appreciate. Thus, output could grow by about 3 percent
in 2010, slowing down to 1.9 percent in 2011—higher than Riksbank projections as of April
of 2.2 percent for 2010 but lower than 3.7 percent projected by Riksbank for 2011.

“Cash for clunkers” schemes ended in August 2009 in the U.S., and ended in Spring 2010 in Italy and the UK,
in December in Germany, and at end-2011 in France, Spain and the Netherlands. A housing tax credit for firsttime home buyers in the U.S. expired in April 2010, while tax breaks for construction and investment projects

If so, the output gap will remain large
for 2010. According to estimates based on
aggregate production function and filtering
techniques, the gap is likely to narrow only a
little in 2010, to somewhere between 3 and
6 percent of potential output.

short-run uncertainties, the outlook for
potential output growth over the medium-term is similarly clouded. It has been dented by the
contraction in gross domestic fixed investment and may be compounded if hysteresis effects
appear in labor markets.
III. IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICIES AND POLICY FRAMEWORKS: 2010–11
23.
In this environment, the central outlook is for moderate growth for Sweden but with
significant downside risks. Thus, policy should remain strongly supportive, while standing
ready to tighten rapidly if upside scenarios emerge.
24.

These challenges—with echoes elsewhere—have a particular character in Sweden.


While, for other advanced economies, renewed growth alongside fiscal sustainability
concerns calls for measured withdrawal of fiscal stimulus soon, external demand may
lag for Sweden, fiscal fundamentals are uniquely robust, and monetary policy
nominal rates are already close to their floors. Thus, need and scope for fiscal
stimulus in 2010-11 remains, even in the central case.



Others also face capital inflows, but these are mainly rapidly growing competitive
economies with inflows that are expected to ease once the major countries pick up.
Sweden’s growth is less secure and the “safe haven” inflows could endure—
particularly if fiscal sustainability concerns in the Euro Area prove to be protracted.



Likewise, many countries have to rebuild their financial sectors, but policy in Sweden
has also to address the large size of the sector and its particular regional exposures—
with inward and outward spillover risks still primary concerns.



And if global demand for investment goods and consumer durables lags over the
medium-term, Swedish employment may need to shift into services. Thus, while
aspirations to raise employment will require appropriate support for aggregate
demand, it will also require labor market structures which facilitate these shifts.

26.
Thus, on the authorities’ current plans, fiscal stimulus across the global crisis has
been spread out (¶49–51). And given sizeable automatic stabilizers, discretionary stimulus
has given greater emphasis to supporting long-run supply side efficiencies, as opposed to
immediate support for aggregate demand. Most of the discretionary stimulus over 2009–11 is
accounted for by tax measures, including permanent cuts in corporate tax, social security
contributions and personal income tax—with an expansion of the earned income tax credit—
though temporary spending measures to support active labor market policies and stem the fall
in employment at the local government level are also included. The estimated multiplier of
such tax cuts is 0.35 percent, compared with a 0.7 percent from equivalent expenditure
measures. Their contribution to addressing the structural shifts needed in employment is
discussed below.

This is broadly appropriate.
While the overall fiscal support for
demand was smaller than was planned
in 2009 and is on the lower end of EU
countries even including 2010 plans
(Text chart), the envisaged discretionary
stimulus planned for 2010–11
appropriately balances the risks. Given
strong fiscal fundamentals, the size of the
output gap (however estimated), doubts
about the strength of prospective growth,
and constraints on monetary policy, a

23
presumption of further stimulus is appropriate. Under the fiscal authorities’ central case
assumptions of growth of 2½ percent in 2010, the fiscal balance will deteriorate from a
deficit of 0.8 percent of GDP in 2009 to 2.1 percent of GDP in 2010.
28.
These plans remain consistent with continued observance of the authorities’ nominal
expenditure ceilings, even on staff assumptions. The picture on the balance target is less
clear, however, as estimates of the structural fiscal balance have become particularly
hazardous—with both the output gap and estimates of the stabilizers highly uncertain at
present. This is reflected in the differences between staff and the authorities’ estimates, and
discrepancies of both from estimates of the cumulative structural impact of fiscal initiatives
since 2008 (Box 2). On balance, the strains with respect to observance of the balance target
appear likely to rise, especially if the stimulus measures already announced for 2011 are not
offset by other actions. In that context, if by the fall of 2010 the medium-term outlook for
growth is stronger than is now anticipated, some policy tightening will be necessary, and a
balance will need to be struck between monetary and fiscal action. To the extent that the
stronger outlook is accompanied by further appreciation of the exchange rate, then offsets to
the planned structural fiscal stimulus for 2011—perhaps going as far as implying overall
consolidation if competitiveness concerns mount considerably--should support monetary
tightening.
29.
The current fiscal framework has anchored policies well including during the recent
downturn (see Attachment 1). However, the increasing number of indicators to assess
compliance with the balance target risks is raising concerns in some quarters about its
credibility. This raises further the premium on the Swedish Council for Fiscal Policy in
preparing detailed assessments and conclusions for the general public regarding the
consistency of policy with the rules.

B. Monetary Policy and Framework
30.
The authorities have successfully headed off earlier considerable concerns with the
possibility of disinflation. Inflation excluding mortgage interest rates has consistently
remained within the target range (notwithstanding negative headline inflation rates for a
period), nominal wage growth remains moderately positive, and inflation expectations
remain well anchored. Alongside concerns that house prices have been quickly recovering,
supported by bank lending to the household continuing to grow at 10 percent (year-on-year),
the authorities have indicated that a tightening cycle will begin in summer 2010.
31.
Inflation pressures are not expected to rise for now. Even with fiscal policy tending to
err on the side of stimulus for 2010, export and growth prospects remain uncertain and in any
event the output gap remains large. Moreover, since early 2010, capital inflows have
intensified upward pressures on the krona, providing additional disinflationary impetus and
compounding concerns for the growth outlook. And while house price inflation is notable, it
may be spurred in part by the earlier preannouncement of the recent termination of a tax
stimulus. And even if that played a minor role, appreciation of asset prices is intended as a
key means of stimulating demand, so house price appreciation might more appropriately be
viewed as further evidence of the success of efforts to avert a deeper downturn. Nevertheless,
risks of a sharp correction and possible macroeconomic disturbances remain, so close
surveillance remains appropriate, alongside cautions to individual borrowers (¶56).
32.
Accordingly, the tightening cycle should be gradual and cautious. In particular, if
market turmoil in Europe continues, this could provide grounds to delay it. But in any event,
the stance of monetary policy will remain highly accommodative, without threatening the
inflation target.
33.
The flexible inflation targeting regime has proved its worth during the crisis. It
accommodated focus of the initial overall policy response to global crisis on monetary
relaxation, including via a significant depreciation. This outturn also underscores that in the
case of small open economies such as Sweden, monetary instruments remain effective even
when policy rates reach their nominal floors. This is because such economies have the option

25
to relax the effective monetary stance through exchange rate channels to head off risk of
deflation through direct intervention in foreign exchange markets. Thus, concerns to the
effect that risk of ineffectiveness of monetary instruments warrants more elevated inflation
targets do not apply in such cases.
34.
In June, the Riksbank abolished +/-1 percent tolerance interval around the inflation
target rate to strengthen its communication―particularly, to avoid unnecessary
misunderstanding by the public when inflation falls outside the range (¶57). This remains
consistent with accountability, as the general principles guiding policymaking—including
how actual and projected deviations from target are treated—are laid out occasionally and
formally in issues of “Monetary Policy in Sweden”.
C. Financial Sector Policy and Framework
35.
The specter of global financial collapse after Lehman’s has been contained (Figures 8
and 9). Swedish bank capital has been raised, non-banks solvency ratios have recovered
along with global stock prices, and exit from extraordinary financial sector support measures
has begun— the Riksbank has begun tightening conditions for its term repo operations. In
this context, challenges arise from uncertain regional—including Euro Area—growth, Baltic
exposures, continued dependence on non-deposit funding, and uncertainties ahead of
regulatory reforms expected from the global consultative process underway. Most recently,
the authorities decided to maintain the debt guarantee scheme until end-2010, which was
scheduled to be terminated effective end April 2010, along with other EU members (¶57).
36.
Stress tests provide comfort on immediate vulnerabilities. The Riksbank’s main
scenario projects credit losses in 2010 of ½ percent of total loans, down from 1½ percent a
year ago, reflecting better outturns than expected and the improved GDP growth outlook in
the Nordic and Baltic regions. The stress scenario assumes prolonged domestic and regional
recession and associated declines in employment and rises in borrowers’ financial distress. It
shows credit losses rising to a total of 4 percent in 2010–12. But even so all major banks are
projected to maintain core Tier 1 capital ratios well above 8 percent and so well above the
4 percent ratios secured in the adverse scenario in
the stress test a year ago.

37.
Nevertheless, uncertainties remain, notably
regarding the corporate sectors’ financial position.
Market indicators suggest that banks continue to
face a heightened credit risks there, particularly in
non-durable consumer goods and services sector
and construction and real estate sectors (Text

38.
Furthermore, significant banking operations abroad—encompassing jurisdictions with
varied supervisory quality—give rise to credit and reputational risks from subsidiaries to
parents, and to euro and/or dollar liquidity risks in the event of market strains. These
idiosyncratic elements should be reflected in Swedish capital and liquidity requirements. And
where operations potentially generate liquidity needs in foreign currency, liquidity
requirements should take into account that the Riksbank resources available to satisfy them
are limited. And cross- border resolution frameworks should be developed further in line
with EU proposals.
39.
More broadly, with confidence broadly restored, bank regulatory arrangements
should aim to wean the financial sector off of the extensive contingent public support it now
enjoys, including for too-big-to-fail banks and including their dependence on Riksbank
liquidity. But steps to do this—including tightening liquidity and capital requirements—
should be taken in light of their impact via credit conditions on the monetary stance (and vice
versa). In scenarios in which monetary tightening is appropriate, such measures should
accompany (if not preceded) actions to raise central policy rates. In other scenarios, such
steps should be taken only in so far as—and in ways that—they do not indirectly tighten the
monetary stance. And any such steps should be taken on the basis that further adjustments
may be needed in light of prospective international agreement on banking regulations.
40.
Ability to manage tail risks also remains a concern. In particular, while direct
exposures to Euro Area peripherals are minimal, strains there could deepen or widen,
affecting third countries to which Swedish financial firms are exposed directly or indirectly.
Indeed, these spillover effects are apparent in market data for the large Swedish banks (See
Attachment II). Thus, a priority is to verify the adequacy of contingency plans, including the
assessment of liquidity risks in the financial system, supervisory and crisis management
readiness, and the level of international reserves, not least given continued reliance of
Swedish banks on substantial wholesale funding (Attachment II). Even given the legal
framework for nationalization of banks in case of emergency, the option to extend this toolkit
to include a special resolution framework for financial institutions is encouraged (Box 6;
¶55).
41.
The most fundamental need however is to strengthen micro and macro supervisory
capacity and to review the crisis management framework, including the authorities’ capacity
to deal with possible strains in the financial sector. A reform initiative has just begun, with
reviews by a government commission expected to be completed within two years. The key
issues include: (i) the division of labor on micro and macro prudential regulations among the
Ministry of Finance, the Riksbank, the Financial Supervisory Authority, and the National
Debt Office; (ii) macro prudential tools; (iii) a bank resolution framework and a deposit
insurance scheme; (iv) international reserve management; and (v) supervisory capacity
building. Any reforms to the architecture of macroprudential institutions should maintain
effective communication and coordination between all authorities, with appropriate
accountability, and retain the independence of monetary policymaking.

28
42.
The 2006 FATF assessment report suggested some weaknesses in Sweden’s
AML/CFT framework. Among several measures to address such concerns, Sweden
implemented the third EU Money Laundering Directive on March 15, 2009, and the FSA
issued new regulations and guidelines governing measures against money laundering and
terrorist financing on May 15, 2009.
Box 5. Proposals to Strengthen Sweden’s Financial Stability Framework
Some elements of the financial stability framework could usefully be strengthened.


Bank resolution framework. In October 2008, the government enacted “Government
Support to Credit Institutions Act” which gives the National Debt Office power to grant
credit guarantees, and if there is a serious systemic risk and bank capital falls below
25 percent of the regulatory requirement, take over a troubled bank (¶55). This scheme
was first applied in resolving the Carnegie Investment Bank failure in late 2008.



A Prompt Corrective Action style ladder is needed, covering all banks and fully
empowering the FSA to take the full range of supervisory corrective actions.



Supervisory capacity. The FSA remains constrained by high staff turnover, and it would
benefit from greater funding, including to allow more thorough on-site inspections.



Deposit insurance scheme. Under the current legal framework, deposit insurance funds
can only be disbursed after a failed bank is placed into bankruptcy. The insolvency
process can be initiated by the petition of an unpaid creditor or by the failed bank itself,
but not by the FSA. Thus, the process could be lengthy. Furthermore, the ability of the
authorities to obtain relevant information about the balance sheet of a troubled bank at an
early stage should be clarified.



Cross border coordination. There are major uncertainties in how a cross-border crisis
would be resolved in a coordinated way. Memoranda of Understanding on crisis
management were signed at the EU level and with three Baltic countries. New MOUs
between the Nordic and Baltic economies are under active preparation.



Non-bank financial institution supervision. A number of non-bank financial institutions
raise deposits, but they are neither subject to FSA supervision nor reporting requirements.

29
Box 6. Why Is a Special Resolution Framework for Banks Needed?
Sweden does not have a special resolution framework for financial institutions. Currently,
the authorities have two broad sets of resolution tools: public fund injections (including partial
to full nationalization) and corporate bankruptcy. The nationalization approach proved
effective in solving the Swedish banking crisis in the early 1990s and the Carnegie Investment
bank failure in late 2008. However, reliance on corporate bankruptcy has as elsewhere proved
challenging, as evidenced by the case of Custodia (a credit market institution). In particular,
lengthy judicial reviews after the revocation of its license by the FSA led to higher costs to the
government and public. 1
Experience during the current global crisis proves the need for a special resolution
framework, separate from corporate bankruptcy, to enhance the toolkit for effective and
least-cost crisis management. The FSA―rather than creditors or shareholders―should have
the sole power to put the institution into resolution procedure immediately at a predetermined
capital level after revoking its license. A resolution law should also ensure that a receiver or
liquidator appointed by a public body should have the right to use all resolution methods, such
as acquisition by a private sector purchaser, bridge bank, and partial transfer of deposits and
assets to a good bank. The law should also ensure appropriate creditor safeguards so that no
creditor of a resolved bank is left any worse off than the situations without the special
resolution framework.
This would follow practice elsewhere. In Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United
States, special regime laws provide for special rules for bank insolvency, with the
administration the supervisor or the deposit protection agency.
___________________________
1

In January 2006, the FSA attempted to revoke Custodia’s license but was unable to place it into bankruptcy. While
the case is reviewed by the court, Custodia continued to accept deposits from the public for a while. In August 2006,
the shareholders finally placed the institution into bankruptcy. During this period, the value of assets declined
significantly, resulting in an increase in losses covered by the government’s deposit insurance.

improved information for job seekers regarding

direct taxation which dominated the stimulus packages in 2009–10 (¶49, 58) will help by
supporting growth of new sectors. This will help to avoid hysteresis effects in unemployment
and support the structural shifts needed in coming years.

45.
Such efforts could be taken further. The difference between employment protection
between regular and temporary workers could be rebalanced to avoid impeding the shift of
workers in over-invested sectors to more productive uses, and the increase in the proportion
of temporary workers in the total is symptomatic of this challenge. Furthermore, with
70 percent of workers unionized, future wage setting mechanisms need to maintain
flexibility. However, further expansion of direct measures (e.g., tax incentives or
discretionary subsidies for firms to hoard labor) may only contribute marginally as public

33
spending on active measures is already high, and is already well focused on those elements of
these policies which have generally been found to be most effective (See Attachment III).
IV. THE AUTHORITIES’ VIEWS 4
46.

The authorities agreed with the overall staff assessment.

47.
Following global crisis and Baltic difficulties, decisive macroeconomic and financial
sector stabilization policies and eased regional and global conditions had secured a rebound
in exports and output from mid-2009, which had reportedly accelerated significantly in the
first quarter of 2010. Household consumption and the service sectors remained buoyant
throughout, working hours had adjusted flexibly in the most adversely affected sectors, and
recently employment had begun rising. Core inflation and inflation expectations have held
close to target, despite the shocks and volatility in the krona, and financial sector resilience
has been strengthened significantly (¶2–11).
48.
But the output gap remains large and, as underscored by ongoing strains in Europe,
Sweden remains vulnerable to global shocks. So even as a return to “normal”
macroeconomic policy settings is signaled—by reaffirmation of the commitment to the fiscal
rules and by advancing the anticipated commencement of the monetary tightening cycle—the
policy stance will remain highly accommodative in the near term. But policies will tighten
prudently over time given current expectations (¶13, 21, 23).
Fiscal policy and framework
49.
Aversion to budget deficits—which dates back to the early 1990s—remains strong
among the general public and all parties, even in the context of downturns. However,
discretionary stimulus of some 1½ percent of GDP in 2009, was needed to address both
immediate uncertainties and to continue to support long term productive efficiencies in the
economy. Both objectives were reflected in the composition of the stimulus measures—
including reductions in personal and corporate taxes, increased allocations to various active
labor market and business support initiatives, and added transfers to municipalities (¶3).
50.
Nevertheless, the 2009 budget balance outturn was unexpectedly strong. While the
buoyancy of employment and household incomes played key roles in this, further factors
include continued additional savings from earlier initiatives to tighten eligibility for various
entitlement programs, low take up rates for some of the discretionary support initiatives, and
reductions in the size of the automatic stabilizers following reforms to labor markets and tax
structures (Box 2). These matters remain under review.
4

Paragraph references in this section refer to the paragraphs reporting staff’s views on the relevant topic.

34
51.
Given strong public finances, output well below capacity, and need to reinforce
structural flexibility in the economy still further, additional discretionary fiscal stimulus of
2¼ percentage points of GDP has been provided in 2010, balanced across further income tax
reductions and spending on municipalities. The timing and nature of further action to
strengthen flexibility will be considered in light of macroeconomic developments in Sweden
and abroad, and be consistent with continued adherence to the framework of fiscal rules
(¶25–27).
52.
Those fiscal rules anticipated and weathered global crisis well and remain the central
anchor for budget policy. The unusual nature of the recent downturn has, as elsewhere,
complicated measurement of compliance with the surplus target. To improve monitoring, a
ten-year average of net lending is now used to assess past savings, while the average surplus
from 2000 has been dropped. However, the role of the Swedish Fiscal Policy Council
remains central in making overall and final assessments of these matters, and it indicates that
policies for 2010 remain appropriate under the rules and given the strains in markets in
Europe at present (¶28–29).
Monetary policy and framework
53.
The strong showing of the Swedish economy from late-2009, as reflected in a variety
of indicators, as well as some concern with the housing market, was reflected in the
Riksbank’s Executive Board’s decision in February 2010 to advance its anticipated
commencement of the tightening cycle to the summer of 2010. While the timing and extent
of this action remains under review, and developments in Europe will be taken into account,
domestic developments suggest that this indication remains appropriate as a first step towards
returning monetary policy back to “normal” settings. In any case, the stance of monetary
policy will remain highly accommodative in the near term (¶30–32).
54.
The monetary framework remains appropriate. The recent decision to remove the
tolerance interval around the inflation target was taken because no operational consequences
necessarily follow from outturns outside the interval, and full assessments of policy and
prospects are provided by the Executive Board in all cases (¶33–34).
Financial sector policy and framework
55.
As reflected in the latest Financial Stability Report, published in June 2010,
vulnerabilities have receded following stabilization in the domestic and regional economies,
and multiple steps taken to reinforce bank capital. Capacity to manage trouble institutions has
been confirmed in practice, and the bank resolution law of 2008 provides a secure framework
for crisis management via nationalization. The guiding principle is that in such cases, former
shareholders should bear their full burden, and this is reflected in adoption in October 2008
of the “bank stability fee” of 0.0018 percent on bank non-equity liabilities (doubling in 2011)
to prefund any interventions in future. Options to extend the range of instruments available to

35
manage weak institutions will be reviewed by a government commission which will report to
the government within two years (¶5, 40).
56.
The housing market remains a concern for consumer and macroeconomic stability
reasons, rather than financial stability reasons. Preemptive steps taken to cool the market.
include repeated reminders by Executive Board members that new borrowers taking variable
rate mortgages should be aware that rates will rise, and proposals for penalties on new
mortgages with loan-to-value ratios above 85 percent have been presented by the FSA board
((¶31).
57.
In light of recent market stresses in Europe, the debt guarantee scheme was extended
to end-2010—with its duration now governed by EU agreement on such schemes.
Furthermore, tests of contingency planning continue, and the level of international reserves
will be assessed in this context (¶35, 40).
Labor market policies and framework
58.
Unemployment remains a key concern, notwithstanding stronger employment
outturns than anticipated. Active labor market initiatives will therefore remain extensive,
supported by further reductions in income taxation to raise incentives to work. But with a
“realistic” attitude from both sides of industry evident in the “local crisis” wage agreements
and in the recent multi-year settlements, reduced employment protection is not needed in
order to strengthen broader economic performance (¶44–45).
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
After a long boom, Sweden was amongst the first to falter in the great recession
59.
Output peaked at end-2007, and fell 5 percent in 2009. Unemployment has risen to
over 9 percent, corporate financial positions—notably of manufacturing exporters—have
deteriorated, and output may be some 4 to 6 percent below capacity.
The downturn was resisted by aggressive stabilization policies
60.
These were led by a sharp relaxation of monetary policy, a slew of emergency
financial sector support measures, and actions raising bank capital. Alongside, a fiscal
relaxation of 3 percentage points of GDP to a deficit of 0.8 percent of GDP in 2009
supported demand. All these actions were accompanied by a 15 percent real effective
depreciation of the krona, from levels that on some measures were already competitive.

36
These policies have yielded fruit
61.
As globally, earlier financial strains have eased and exit from emergency financial
sector support measures has begun. Credit to households remained buoyant, and concerns
with a deflationary spiral have been erased—with core inflation and inflation expectations
remaining close to target throughout. Moreover, personal consumption held up firmly, and
firms hoarded labor to a far greater extent than in the 1990s. In this context, output began to
rise from mid-2009.
62.
The policy actions taken were effective because they occurred against the background
of Sweden’s credible inflation targeting, freely floating exchange rate, and budgetary
frameworks—with public debt sustainably below 45 percent of GDP.
Nevertheless, prospects for growth in 2010–11 remain uncertain
63.
While the global growth outlook is better than earlier anticipated, risks remain
elevated, and global demand for consumer durables and investment and intermediate
goods—in which Sweden specializes—lags the global recovery. Moreover, market stress in
Europe has prompted a market “search for strong sovereigns” which has reversed much of
the earlier krona depreciation, denting prospects for net exports and growth. All this is
appropriately reflected in the Riksbank’s assessment growth in Sweden in 2010 could be as
high as 5 percent or as low as -1 percent.
Accordingly, the authorities’ intentions to keep policies supportive are appropriate
Fiscal policy anchors this effort
64.
The budget anticipates a further increase in the deficit to over 2 percent of GDP
in 2010. This includes tax reductions and increased transfers to municipalities, summing to
2¼ percent of GDP. As this responds to concerns with output prospects, and, as indicated by
the Swedish Fiscal Policy Council, is fully consistent with fiscal stability and the framework
of fiscal rules, it is appropriate. If economic growth and employment turn out to be stronger
than anticipated, the budget balance will do likewise. And the tax reductions in the 2009–10
budgets will help to boost structural flexibility.
65.
As the current fiscal rules—targeting a surplus of 1 percent of GDP across the cycle,
supported by medium-term expenditure ceilings—remain well suited for Sweden, the critical
element in any changes will be to reinforce the central role of the Swedish Fiscal Policy
Council in assessing compliance.
Alongside, the monetary stance is set to remain highly accommodative
66.
The rekindling of growth optimism and some concerns with house prices has
underpinned recent Riksbank announcements that the anticipated tightening cycle would be

37
brought forward to mid-2010. Nonetheless, inflationary pressures remain well contained.
Given the large output gap and recent krona strength, the immediate outlook is for core
inflation to continue to fall. Accordingly, the tightening cycle should be gradual and cautious.
And continued uncertainty over the implications of market strains in Europe could provide
grounds to consider the appropriate time for its start.
67.
The decision to retire the tolerance interval around the inflation target avoids raising
unnecessary concern when headline inflation falls outside the range. Accountability under the
adjustment is retained by the occasional publication of the principles guiding how
policymakers use their discretion within the inflation targeting framework.
And financial stability remains under close surveillance
68.
The Riksbank Financial Stability Report indicates that core Tier 1 capital ratios for all
large banks will remain above 8 percent even in a stress scenario. This is stronger than
previous assessments, partly reflecting the improved outlook for the Baltics. And the
Financial Supervisory Authority’s proposal to penalize loan-to-value ratios above 85 percent
will help to address vulnerabilities. Nevertheless, risks remain, including those from banking
operations abroad and from liquidity risks in euro and dollar markets. These elements should
continue to be reflected in Swedish capital and liquidity requirements in line with
forthcoming global agreements on such arrangements. And cross-border resolution
frameworks should be developed further, in line with EU proposals.
Ability to manage tail risks should also remain under active review
69.
While direct exposures to Euro Area peripherals are minimal, Sweden is exposed
indirectly. Thus, a priority is to update “war games” to verify contingency plans. These
would also provide a useful opportunity to confirm that international reserves are at
appropriate levels. And steps to establish a special resolution regime to manage troubled
financial institutions and to further raise resources for banking supervision are welcome. Any
reforms to the architecture of macroprudential institutions should maintain effective
communication and coordination between all authorities, with appropriate accountability, and
retain the independence of monetary policymaking.
70.

Sweden should remain on the standard 12-month consultation cycle.

ATTACHMENT I. ARE SWEDEN’S FISCAL RULES AS GOOD AS THEY LOOK?1
A. Introduction
1.
Sweden’s fiscal policy framework has been firmly in place throughout the last
decade. It grew out of the economic and financial crisis of the early 1990s. The deterioration
of public finances during that period—public debt and the general government deficit
peaking respectively, at more than 70 percent of GDP and 12 percent of GDP—underscored
the need for decisive fiscal reforms. Indeed, prior to the current European sovereign debt
crisis, Sweden was the only country among the EU-14 to have experienced a downgrade in
public debt during the 1990s. Fiscal policies consolidated sharply beginning in 1993,
underpinned by a framework of numerical fiscal rules and budget institutions.
2.
In recent years, Sweden has established its fiscal credentials, reflected in strong fiscal
outturns even during the recent global recession. It used the boom period in the run-up to the
crisis to build up strong public finance buffers, with structural surpluses in all but one year
since 2000, and public debt falling to a low of 38 percent of GDP (Appendix Figure 1).
Expenditure rules are credible, as targets have consistently been met since their inception,
and local governments have maintained surpluses.
3.
This has set Sweden apart. Throughout the crisis, the fiscal position has remained
strong relative to Sweden’s peers—in 2008–09, the structural surplus declined slightly from
2.3 to 2.2 percent of GDP, while the headline fiscal balance deteriorated from 2.5 to
-0.8 percent of GDP (Appendix Figure 1). Moreover, Sweden has adhered to its fiscal rules,
despite also delivering substantial fiscal stimulus in the context of a large contraction in real
output by 7 percent from peak to trough in 2008–09. In contrast, in many countries, the
current global crisis has tested fiscal rules, bringing them into conflict with the desired fiscal
policy response. By mid-2009, more than half the countries in Europe with national fiscal
rules had either modified or suspended them. At the supra-national level, as of May 2010,
only two countries have avoided excessive deficit procedures under the European Union’s
Stability and Growth Pact—Sweden and Estonia.
4.
This note assesses how Sweden’s rules have managed to hold up. The objective is to
identify features of the rules-based framework that have been particularly useful, which
could provide valuable lessons for other countries currently faced with the prospect of fiscal
consolidation and seeking to build fiscal frameworks to assist this. The analysis is guided by
the following three questions:
a.

1

Have the rules delivered anti cyclical fiscal policy?

Prepared by Rita Babihuga.

47
b.

Was the fiscal stimulus delivered during the crisis appropriately, timely,
temporary and targeted?

c.

Have the rules delivered long term credibility?
B. The Fiscal Framework

5.

The fiscal framework consists of:



A nominal expenditure ceiling introduced in 1997 covering primary spending of the
central government and spending of the old age pension system; is determined three
years in advance in the budget and then approved by parliament; and is considered
binding;



A balanced budget requirement for local governments introduced in 2000;



A surplus target for the general government also introduced in 2000, though lowered
from 2 percent surplus over the cycle to 1 percent over the cycle in April 20072.

6.
The framework of numerical rules is supported by strong budget institutions and
mechanisms. The Swedish fiscal policy council is only one of 7 fiscal councils worldwide,
established in 2007 to provide an independent evaluation of the government’s fiscal policies
(Appendix table). It complements other institutions such as the National Institute for
Economic Research, the National Financial Management Authority and the National Audit
Office, which also evaluate and carry out independent forecasts of macroeconomic and fiscal
policies in Sweden. Moreover, the top-down approach followed by the central government
budget gives parliament responsibility for fiscal aggregates in addition to strengthening
expenditure control, which in turn helps to support fiscal discipline.
7.
Moreover, this framework is supported by a broad domestic consensus. By all
accounts, there exists a high degree of both social and political consensus within Sweden on
the need to safeguard long term public finances, and on the important role of the current
rules-based fiscal framework to this end. This consensus is rooted in Sweden’s experience
with fiscal crisis in the early 1990s.
C. Assessing how well the rules have worked
Have the rules delivered anti cyclical fiscal policy?

2

This change followed the Eurostat reclassification of funded pension system from the general government
sector to the household sector (Lindh and Ljungman (2008)

48
8.
When designed appropriately, fiscal rules have been associated with more
countercyclical fiscal policies. Expenditure rules, for instance, can be beneficial in limiting
pro cyclical expenditure increases in upturns as well as the need to compensate through
expenditure reductions in the ensuing downturns. Holm-Hadulla et. al., (2009) and
Ayuso-i-Casals et. al., (2007) find evidence that numerical expenditure rules limit the pro
cyclical bias of government spending among Euro area countries and lead to stronger
budgetary outcomes. Others, notably Debrun and Kumar (2007) and Debrun et. al., (2008),
have found that stricter and broader fiscal rules are associated with higher cyclically adjusted
primary balances.
9.
In the case of Sweden, the balance
has been anti cyclical reflecting that
expenditures generally show a
countercyclical pattern over time and
revenues appear pro cyclical (Text
Figure). Expenditures, in particular
transfers and consumption, appear
strongly counter-cyclical over 1970–
2009, while gross fixed capital formation
less counter-cyclical (Figure 1). Tax
revenues and social contributions appear
to be particularly pro cyclical.

Moreover, expenditures also appear countercyclical when compared to growth
surprises in 1999–2009. In general, positive GDP shocks have typically been met with lowerthan-projected expenditures.

11.
A more formal estimation of the link between fiscal rules and budgetary outcomes
considers a fiscal reaction function for Sweden and its EU-14 peers. In summary, the
dependent variable is the cyclically adjusted primary balance (CAPB), and the explanatory
variables are: the lagged CAPB and debt level, to capture the fiscal stabilization motives of
the fiscal authorities, the fiscal rules coverage index developed by the European commission,
as well as controls for changes in the policy regime.
12.
The results suggest that the underlying fiscal balance in Sweden is countercyclical,
and fiscal rules have more of an impact on fiscal policy in Sweden relative to its peers. The
coefficient on the output gap has a positive value—in other words, on average, a cyclical
upturn (downturn) tends to improve (deteriorate) the CAPB, indicating that government
policy actions seek to increase the counter cyclical bent of fiscal policy. The coefficient
reflecting the influence of the fiscal rule index on the fiscal position is positive and
significant, indicating that an increase in the value of the index (i.e., a larger coverage and/or
stronger features of fiscal rules) leads to lower deficits or higher surpluses. Moreover, this
coefficient is much larger for Sweden than the average for the EU-14 countries, suggesting
that fiscal rules play a stronger role in driving fiscal outcomes in Sweden.

Was the response timely and
temporary? By their nature automatic
stabilizers play an immediate role during
downturns, and in the case of Sweden this
provided immediate stimulus, given that the
bulk of fiscal stimulus arrived via this
channel. Similarly, the primary fiscal balance
can be expected to improve automatically as
economic activity picks up, thereby
unwinding most of the fiscal expansion.

Sources: European Commission , AMECO database.

15.
Fiscal stabilisers in Sweden are determined by the labor market. Given the structure
of the budget—taxes on labor income make up two thirds of total tax revenues—automatic
stabilisers tend to respond to a greater extent to the labor market, rather than to output. This
is particularly evident during the current downturn, where a smaller unemployment response
to output, compared to historical patterns, contributed to a stronger than expected fiscal
outturns for 2009.
16.
Moreover, by their formulation, the nominal expenditure ceilings provide additional
room for spending during downturns. The 3-year in advance expenditure ceilings as well as
projected expenditures under the ceiling are set in nominal terms. Hence, when inflation
declines—as in the current downturn—this could in principle allow for additional
countercyclical spending in real terms, within the expenditure ceiling. This factor is sizeable
in Sweden: if in a given year inflation is one percentage point below projections, the real
spending implied by the nominal expenditure ceiling is some ½ a percentage point of GDP
higher than anticipated.
17.
Was the response targeted? Without
household survey data for 2009, it is difficult to
assess the targeting efficiency of the fiscal
response. Yet, macroeconomic data indicate that
there was a stabilizing impact on household
consumption deriving from lower taxes and higher
transfers from government (Figure 2).
18.
All in all, there is little evidence that the
rules framework inhibited appropriate
countercyclical policy making. However, it is
noteworthy that in the aggregate, the greater

part of discretionary measures have been implemented on the revenue side of the budget—
despite higher estimates of multipliers on the expenditure side. Furthermore, even though
buffers under the expenditure ceiling in 2009 were substantial, nevertheless some 0.3 percent
of GDP in stimulus-related grants to local government were recorded in 2010 instead of 2009
to maintain these buffers and the expenditure ceiling was subsequently met with a margin of
0.8 percent of GDP (some SEK 24 billion). While this illustrates the constraints fiscal
authorities could theoretically have faced had a significantly larger countercyclical response
been required, nonetheless it is notable that the framework accommodated the necessary
fiscal response to the largest downturn in a generation, with room to spare.

While, there is little empirical evidence suggesting that rules alone are credibility

Swedish bond yields have performed much better than empirical models would
predict since market concerns with European sovereign risks have come to the fore. For
example, an empirical model for sovereign bond yields is estimated by Tang (2009) for a
sample of advanced countries. The dependent variable is government bond yields, and the
explanatory variables are a measure of market stress, proxied by the VIX index, the global
risk free rate, public debt, net IIP and government budget balances. Daily data are used to
capture changes in market sentiment, while interactive terms are used to indicate how the
impact of marginal changes in market volatility on bond yields varies with the fiscal position.
The results for Sweden suggest that:

a. Sovereign bond yields were weighed down earlier in the crisis—presumably by
concerns about Sweden’s banking sector—but these concerns have abated with
Swedish bond yields recovering strongly.
b. Since end-2008, Swedish bond yields have consistently been below levels
predicted by the model, with the residual widening since end-2009. This appears
to reflect the increasing premium placed on sovereign fiscal credentials in markets
in the context of the concerns with these matters in Europe. In this context the
widening gap between actual and fitted values of Swedish bond yields is a
reflection of the strong fiscal fundamentals in Sweden, one part of which is the
rules framework in place.

D. Conclusion
21.
Sweden’s experience shows that a well designed fiscal framework of rules and
institutions can deliver strong budgetary outcomes when underpinned by political consensus.
In practice even the best rules may come under pressure absent a strong political commitment
to the framework—notable in Sweden is the strength of the national consensus regarding the
fiscal rules framework. This has clearly made strong public finances a widely accepted
national objective and allowed policy makers to build up buffers during boom times. This
latter point is key to answering the question whether the strength of the framework lies in the
rules themselves or the fact that these rules have been operated by Swedes.
22.
Yet, there are areas where the rules could be strengthened. Despite broadly following
a counter cyclical path, fiscal policy appears to have become slightly pro cyclical in 2009
(Appendix Figure 1). This suggests that faced with a sharp downturn, fiscal policy under a

rules-based framework will inevitably have to balance an important trade-off between
achieving a sufficient counter-cyclical response and maintaining consistency with the
numerical rules—granted this depends critically on the labor market’s response to the
downturn. In principle, well designed rules should be sufficiently flexible—yet arguably,
even strong fiscal rules can, and were in fact tested by the severity of the recent global
recession. Currently the rules framework does not have formal corrective mechanisms for
when targets are not observed—such as formal procedures for informing parliament of the
reasons for non compliance as well as the proposed measures for correcting the deviation—
relying on the strength of the response to such developments, ultimately, from voters.
23.
Strengthening the formulation of the structural surplus target could in turn strengthen
its counter cyclical properties and overall credibility. The Fiscal Policy Council have
criticized the formulation of the structural surplus target as too imprecise for careful
monitoring since it relies on the correct definition of the business cycle—which itself is
difficult to estimate precisely. Moreover, an increasing number of fiscal indicators have been
used to assess compliance which risks giving the fiscal authorities too much room for
discretion with respect to meeting targets and weakening the surplus target as a binding
constraint. In addition, the lack of specific corrective mechanisms to address slippages from
the target also presents a problem.
24.
Possible remedies should be careful not to tilt policies in a pro cyclical direction. One
consideration, as the Fiscal Policy council suggests, might be to evaluate the surplus target
over a well-defined period and introduce a clear binding corrective mechanism in the event
of non-compliance, thereby eliminating the need for several indicators to assess compliance
with the target. Yet, such a model—which evaluates the surplus target over a well-defined
period without taking the output gap into consideration—risks increasing pro cyclicality.
Boije et. al., (2009) point to an alternative solution, akin to formulations in the new German
fiscal policy framework and the Swiss framework, which does correct for the risk of pro
cyclicality. This method defines the target directly in terms of structural net lending and
corrects deviations from the structural net lending target only when “the output gap permits”.
However, as they point out, this target could also be problematic given the difficulty in
measuring structural balances, precisely why the Swedish authorities have rejected this
approach. Fundamentally, the burden of assessing compliance with the rules should remain
with the Fiscal Policy Council since indicators, especially those based on estimates of the
cycle, are prone to flaws.

recommendations on the direction of fiscal policy and the overall fiscal stance

Belgium

The Federal Planning Bureau, established in 1994, provides a range of services along similar lines to the CPB in the
Netherlands. In addition, the High Council of Finance, which was reformed in 1989, overseas the coordination of regional
and national fiscal policy. It sets medium term objectives for regional and national budget deficits, and proposes annual
targets, which form the basis for government negotiations. The High Council is chaired by the Minister of Finance, but has
representatives from inside and outside government. Although it has no formal decision making power, it does exert
considerable influence.

Canada

The Parliamentary Budget Office provides independent analysis to Parliament on the state of the nation's finances, the
government's estimates and trends in the Canadian economy, and upon request estimates of the financial cost of any
specific proposals.

Denmark

The Economic Council, established in 1962, prepares economic reports and forecasts on a range of issues including
fiscal policy.

Hungary

The Fiscal Council of the Republic of Hungary was set up in 2009 as ‘an independent state institution that endeavors to
ensure the responsible management of public resources.’ It prepares macroeconomic forecasts which represent the
baseline for budgetary decisions. It also provides comment and advise on fiscal planning more generally, within the
context of existing fiscal rules.

Netherlands

The Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis (CPB) was founded in 1945. It is an independent research institute
and has its own independent external advisory body. It provides economic and fiscal forecasts as inputs into the
budgetary planning process.

(Section E).
B. Globalization of the Swedish Banking System
2.
As with other European economies, the Swedish banking system far exceeds the
national economy. The assets of the banking system amount to over 350 percent of GDP,
about the median for the EU. All financial institutions―banking, insurance, mortgage, asset
management, and other non-bank financial businesses ―comprise more than 550 percent of
GDP.
3.
Since the early 2000s, Swedish banks have increased their outward cross border
operations significantly. In the middle of the 1990s, as domestic banking markets became
saturated, Swedish banks sought business opportunities abroad. As a result, Swedish banks’
total foreign assets more than doubled over the last decade, reaching 150 percent of GDP. Its
foreign liabilities also grew significantly, reflecting Swedish banks’ increased reliance on
wholesale funding to support their credit operations.

This trend in Sweden coincided with EU-wide developments. There, the presence of
foreign bank branches and subsidiaries grew from 60 percent of GDP in 2002 to nearly
95 percent of GDP in 2008. This significant increase partly reflected banks’ incentives to

supportive macroeconomic environment with
low interest rates3; and (iv) high growth prospects in new emerging European economies,
including the Baltics, for which prospects of entry into the euro zone appeared to be
relatively secure.
5.
Major Swedish banks expanded business opportunities mainly in the Nordic and
Baltic regions. Their claims on these regions grew 30–65 percent from 2002 to 2009, much
faster than their overall growth rates (Figure 1). By end-2009, Swedish banks’ foreign claims

61
in the Nordic region reached more than a half of their total foreign claims (less than
30 percent in 2002), while their claims in the Baltic economies reached nearly 10 percent (up
from merely 3 percent in 2002). There are marked differences in strategy taken among the
major banks, which in turn imply geographical risks facing each of Swedish banks differ to
some extent. Nordea lends mostly in the other Nordic economies, while SEB lends in
Sweden and in foreign economies (mostly, the Baltics Total Assets of Subsidiaries and Branches of Credit Institutions from Abroad

In contrast, entry into Swedish domestic

The number of foreign bank subsidiaries and branches
is handful, only three subsidiaries (Danske Bank, DnB

end-2009). And the total of their assets amounts to less
than 10 percent of the total banking system or

C. Risks Arising From Cross-Border Banking Activities
7.
While the expansion of cross border banking brings a number of benefits, it is not
without costs, notably contagion. Such risks could arise from direct financial linkages
between various banks, financial contagion between banks and between banks and
sovereigns, and due to dependence on wholesale funding.
8.
Direct risks arising from Baltic exposures
were prominent in the current crisis, notably for
Swedbank and SEB. Their loan claims on their
Baltic subsidiaries at end 2008 represented
35–45 percent of bank capital (Figure 2), and their
reliance on operating profits from Baltic
operations is extensive. Accordingly,
deterioration in asset quality and profits in Baltic
subsidiaries could present material risks to their
capital.

9.
Contagion effects to the total Swedish banking system have also been apparent.
Moody’s KMV Expected Default Frequency (EDF) indicators suggest sharp increases in
credit risks starting late 2008, notably for Swedbank and SEB (Figure 3). Credit risk default
swap (CDS) spreads also followed a similar pattern although CDS spreads should have been
depressed by the government’s crisis intervention measures (e.g., the introduction of
guarantees in October 2008). Credit risk indicators for the other two banks, Nordea and
Handelsbanken, also increased, but more moderately and less than other Nordic banks’ and
European banks’ average.
10.
Sovereign credit risks of the Nordic
economies have also played a role. Granger
causality tests suggest that credit risk indicators
for Swedish banks closely associated with those
for Baltics as well as Nordic economies.5

banking system (defined as the value of the government’s explicit and implicit contingent
liabilities in case all banks default jointly), as reflected in the put option value implicit in
equity prices, CDS spreads, and banks’ balance sheets.6 The sample for this analysis includes
the four major Swedish banks (Figure 4).


The simple aggregation of an individual bank’s expected losses amounted to SEK
600 billion (19¼ percent of GDP) in the spring of 2009. However, after appropriately
taking into account banks’ mutual dependence following systemic CCA, the total
expected losses became much less. The 50th percent Value-at-Risk (VaR) estimate is
SEK 120 billion (4 percent of GDP), and even under an extreme tail risk scenario, the
95th VaR estimate is SEK 210 billion (6½ percent of GDP).

5

Using daily data for 5-year CDS spreads, Granger-causality tests (with the lag order of 10) are run for (i) a pair
of four major Swedish banks and (ii) a pair of each Swedish bank and Baltics (the average CDS spreads for
Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania) and Nordic economies (the average CDS spreads for Denmark, Finland,
Norway, and Sweden).
6

The basic idea is as following. To the extent that the government’s guarantees do not affect equity values,
CDS spreads should capital only the expected loss that unsecured (senior) creditors bear. Accordingly, the
magnitude of the government guarantees can be captured by the difference between the value of equity-implied
put option (the total expected losses) and the value of CDS-implied put option (the expected losses borne by
creditors).

63


The increase in the expected losses of the banking system was mostly attributed by
Swedbank and SEB. As markets’ perceptions about these banks have improved, so
did the total expected losses of the banking system. Currently, the expected losses
stood at SEK 40 billion (1¼ percent of GDP).



The systemic CCA can provide one method to estimate a guarantee fee for an
individual bank―the fair value of a risk-based guarantee fee that would compensate
for the likelihood that the government’s explicit and implicit contingent liabilities
materializes. The estimated levels of guarantee fees evolved over time and vary
across banks, with Swedbank and SEB subject to the higher fees through the sample
periods.

12.
The similar results can be confirmed by Segoviano and Goodhart (2009)’s
methodology. The analysis is based on CDS spreads and equity prices for the four major
Swedish banks as well as two other Nordic banks (Danske and DNB)―as these Nordic banks
extensively interact with each other in the Nordic region. (Figure 5).


The “joint probability of default” (JPoD) measures market assessment of the risk that
all banks in the sample default jointly―an extreme tail risk which reflects changes in
the individual banks’ probability of default and changes in default dependency among
these banks. This rose to one percent in the spring of 2009, at the peak of market
concern over the Baltics. However, the level of JPoD has remained much lower than
the average of banks’ individual default probabilities, consistent with the previous
results from systemic CCA.



The “systemic relevance” measures the probability that at least one bank becomes
distressed when one other specific bank becomes distressed. This measure rose
sharply towards the Spring of 2009. Interestingly, Handelsbanken and Nordea, which
had less exposures to the Baltics than the other two banks, became the most
systemically important banks. Nordea is the largest bank in the region, and
Handelsbanken has the dominant market share in Sweden.

13.
This analysis can be extended to incorporate sovereign risks. The Distress
Dependence Matrix―which illustrates market perceptions on pair-wise conditional
probabilities of distress―is estimated for a pre-crisis date (August 1, 2008), for a peak crisis
date (April 1, 2009), and for a recent date (April 1, 2010). The sample includes four Swedish
banks, three Nordic economies (Denmark, Norway, Sweden), three Baltic economies
(Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania), Germany (to which SEB has a large exposure), and GIIPS
(Greece, Italy, Ireland, Portugal, and Spain).7 The matrices in Table 1 and Table 2 show the

economies.

64
probability of distress of the bank or economy in the row, conditional on the distress of the
bank or economy in the column. The main results of interest are as follows.


Pre-crisis date (August, 2008). Swedish banks’ risk profile was dominated by
Sweden’s and Nordics’ sovereign risks mostly (Area A in the Table 1).



Peak-crisis date (April 1, 2009). Swedish banks’ risks were perceived to be affected
by sovereign CDS spreads in the Baltics (Area B) and to become increasingly
dependent on other Nordic sovereign risks (Area C). This suggests that heighted
vulnerabilities of the Swedish banking system signaled by markets were in part due to
the Baltics and in part due to the Nordic economies. The average conditional
probability of distress for each Swedish bank also rose, notably for SEB and
Swedbank which have large exposures to the Baltics (Area D). The inter-linkages
among Swedish banks also rose (Area E).



Recent date (April 1, 2010). The pattern of distress dependence looks quite similar to
that of the pre-crisis date (top table). Swedish banks are most vulnerable to Sweden
sovereign risks, followed by other Nordic risks. Risks associated with the Baltic
economies are now much smaller.



This analysis highlights that systemic inter-linkages within banks and across banks
and sovereigns evolves over time.



Swedish banks and GIIPS (Table 2). Swedish banks’ risks with GIIPS rose on
April 2009, apparently on account of deterioration in Swedish banks’ own
creditworthiness, but remain lower than their risks with the Nordics on the same date.
Most recently, despite heightened strains in GIIPS, Swedish banks’ risks with GIIPS
are perceived to be small.

The extensive reliance on wholesale
finding is also reflected in the market
assessments. Banks’ reliance on wholesale
funding has increased significantly since the
early 2000s, with a half of their lending
funded by non-deposit sources. The foreign
currency funding ratio (defined as foreign
currency funding as a percent of total
funding) is high. Some banks also present
extensive liquidity mismatches (defined as
short-term assets minus liabilities as a percent of total assets). While banks’ net foreign
exchange positions are small through hedging, in extreme market circumstances, banks are
exposed to roll-over and counterparty risks.

Spill-over analyses on credit risks above―which focused on market price data―can
be complemented by a network analysis using balance sheet data. On the asset side, Swedish
banks are exposed largely to other Nordic economies and Germany, followed by the United
States, the United Kingdom, and Baltic economies. On the liabilities side, Denmark,
Germany, the United State, the United Kingdom, and France are the top five lenders to
Sweden. On the both sides, Sweden’s exposures to Greece, Italy, Ireland, Portugal, and Spain
(GIIPS) are very small, suggesting that direct linkage with these economies is small. To
illustrate the linkage of risks, using the simplified network analysis and BIS data, the
following hypothetical tail-risk scenarios are considered: the top five lenders for Sweden,
facing liquidity constraint, cut their foreign assets by 10 percent across the board in attempt
to hoard liquidity(Scenario 1); Italy, Ireland, Portugal, and Spain cut their foreign assets by
50 percent for the liquidity hording purpose(Scenario 2); and Greece does not fulfill its
obligations on foreign liabilities(Scenario 3). 8 In these scenarios, it is assumed that no
country uses international reserves to react to the liquidity shocks, and instead reduces its
foreign assets.

calculation, only the direct and first round direct effects are taken into account.

Sweden is very sensitive to shocks
originating from large economies.
These economies hold a large amount
of foreign assets, and thus, across-theboard cuts could cause significant
direct and indirect impacts on Sweden.

Kingdom, have large exposures to

liquidity strains in these lenders, which in turn would affect Sweden.



Similarly, Greece does not directly affect Sweden, but its indirect impact in this
scenario would be significant, equivalent to 60 percent of Sweden’s international
reserves.
D. Existing Supervisory Arrangements for Cross-Border Banking

16.
Under the EU framework, the Swedish authorities are responsible for regulating and
supervising Swedish banking groups, including their branches abroad (Box 2 for the EU
framework). Accordingly, stress tests regularly conducted at both the banks’ and authorities’
levels must include consolidated risk assessments, while banks’ own Internal Risk Based
approach should incorporate risks associated with cross border banking in assessing capital

67
and liquidity adequacy. On supervision, in the past years, Swedish authorities have
intensified oversight of Swedish banks’ cross border operations in cooperation with relevant
authorities abroad.
17.
For the supervision of each of banking groups, special supervisory arrangements have
been set up together with all relevant supervisory authorities abroad. These arrangements are
laid out in various bank-specific Memorandum of Understandings (MOUs), which address
the details of the conduct of supervision, including responsibilities of each supervisory
authority, supervision plan, exchange of information, requirements of notification of material
events. Recently, the Swedish Ministry of Finance, the Riksbank, and the FSA, have begun
formulating a Nordic-Baltic stability group and new MOUs (which include some broad
parameters on burden sharing rules) together with relevant fiscal, monetary and supervisory
authorities.
18.
However, proper risk assessment of cross border banking has been a challenge, while
the MOUs generally lack specific arrangements regarding crisis management and resolution.
Where banks operate under relatively unfamiliar business environments, adequate risk
management would be difficult, particularly due to lack of adequate markets information and
historical experiences. Furthermore, MOUs are simply based on mutually respectful
agreements among relevant parties and lack specifics in critical areas, e.g., modality of early
intervention and trigger of coordinated intervention.
E. Strengthening Cross-Border Banking Regulation
Key challenges
19.
Swedish banks are operating under various business environments, from the
wealthiest economies in the world to emerging Eastern European economies, each with
various fiscal constraints and crisis resolution capacity. Competitive indicators from the
World Economic Forum suggest a very wide range of business environments facing Swedish
banks (Table 3). For example, an indicator for institution quality (e.g., property rights,
government and corporate ethics, and efficiency of legal framework) is among the top 10 for
all Nordic economies, while around or below the world average for Lithuania and Latvia,
with similar variation in the indicator for macroeconomic stability. Supervisory capacity
(e.g., number of banks per supervisor and budget for supervision agencies) also ranges
widely.
20.
Such diversified operational environments add to challenges in establishing sound
and consistent cross-border regulatory and supervisory frameworks. Under the home country
principle, the key to efficient and effective supervision is coordination of supervisors across
different jurisdictions. However, while supervisors attempt to coordinate, they are required to
act on the basis of a national mandate embedded in national legislation. In other words, the
national authorities may be expected to act in the interest of their own country, not in the join
best interest of all. This raises various issues.

home supervisors due to their low
impact on banks’ financial positions as groups, until unexpectedly large shocks in
Baltics were recognized.



Lack of harmonization in crisis prevention frameworks. One of the principles in
preventing a banking crisis is to act swiftly (Ingves, 2010). To this end, supervisors
should have powers to intervene in a bank as early as problems are found. The range
of such supervisory powers diverges widely across supervisors in EU economies
(Table 4). Each supervisor may use different tools, apply different triggers for
remedial action, or offer different degrees of forbearance.9



Differential crisis management capacity. Under the EU framework, host authorities
that are responsible for the supervision of subsidiaries are also responsible for safety
net and crisis resolution. However, the size of economy differs between home
economies and emerging economies, and so does their fiscal capacity underpinning
safety net frameworks. Most importantly, host authorities in emerging economies
may not be able to provide credible deposit insurance, emergency liquidity assistance,
or other debt guarantees as extensive as home authorities in advanced economies may
do. Where a fixed exchange rate regime is adopted, the central bank’s ability in
providing emergency liquidity assistance would be further constrained.



Lack of agreement on basic principles and procedures for crisis resolution and
insolvency framework. The existing EU resolution framework―the Directive on the
Reorganization and the Directive on the Winding-up of Credit Institutions―defines
that the home authorities have sole power to initiate and implement resolution
measures. However, this does not apply to the case for subsidiaries. Besides, in
practice, some EU economies do not have a legal framework for special resolution

69
regime for banks separate from those for non-bank corporates. Furthermore, although
a subsidiary is licensed and registered by the host authorities as a separate legal
entity, often, its operations cannot be separable from assistance from the parent bank
or other subsidiaries in different jurisdictions. This implies that the authorities in each
jurisdiction cannot resolve the problems of cross-border banks separately.
Discussion
21.
Regulatory reform initiatives in the EU have been moving towards more
centralization in supervision frameworks. The amendments to the Capital Requirements
Directive in 2008 aimed to strengthen the power and responsibility of consolidating
supervisors through the establishment of supervisory colleges (chaired by consolidating
supervisors), while it also aimed to improve information rights of host supervisors and to
require supervisors to consider cross-border externalities. The EU’s new supervisory
framework (agreed by the EU Council in December 2009), including the establishment of a
European Systemic Risk Board for macro prudential oversight, and a European System of
Financial Supervisors for micro prudential supervision, is also expected to strengthen the
effectiveness and sufficiency of cross-border banking supervision.
22.
However, more measures may be needed to effectively cope with a crisis. Recall that
one of the critical institutional weaknesses in the current setting is a mismatch between
extensive banks’ activities across jurisdictions and national responsibility over supervision
and resolution. Accordingly, there will be the needs for an integrated EU-level framework for
crisis prevention and management, crisis resolution, and depositor protection (Fonteyne
et. al., 2010).
23.
It will take time to realize such an integrated framework for the EU’s single market or
even for the subset of the EUs (i.e., Nordic and Baltic regions). The difficulty is how to set a
burden sharing rule between economies with heterogeneous size, developmental levels, and
fiscal capacity. There are a number of problems to be solved: for example, adverse selection
(economies with strong banking systems do not want to sign up); moral hazard (the
effectiveness of supervision would be weakened if expected fiscal contributions are smaller
than potential bank failure costs), free rider (economies outside burden sharing agreements
could benefit from them); and incentive incompatibility (systemic importance of subsidiaries
would be less for larger home authorities than smaller host authorities).
24.
Thus, interim measures will be needed. The objective should be to minimize crisis
likelihood and its severity if a crisis happens. Then, the likelihood of necessitating authorities
to take resolution and insolvency measures can be minimized. Below are some options.


More capital and liquidity requirements. The major changes in capital and
liquidity requirements have been under consideration by the Basel Committee.
Tighter capital and liquidity requirements (for both in local and foreign currencies)

70
are expected to strengthen banks’ overall resilience to shocks, and thereby reducing
the likelihood of a failure in cross border banking operations. Furthermore, updated
Basel II guidelines (July 2009) would support higher capital requirements for banks
under Pillar II to take account of various risks, such as firm-wide risk management,
risk concentrations, reputation risk and implicit support, and liquidity risks.


Stronger supervisory capacity and power to prevent and manage a crisis.
Swedish FSA’s resources could be strengthened. And its powers to prevent and
manage a crisis, such as early intervention, could be more enhanced―currently, the
FSA lacks power to (i) appoint a person with specific or general powers at a problem
bank; (ii) coordinate a rescue plan before insolvency is declared; (iii) control or play a
role in the reorganization or winding-up; (iv) initiate insolvency proceedings leading
to the reorganization or winding-up. The division of labor on macro prudential
oversight between the Riksbank and the FSA should also be clarified.



More contributions by systemic important banks to financial stability. Sweden
has already established a stabilization fund ahead of other advanced economies.
Currently, banks pay a flat rate fee levied. The government is planning to introduce
risk based fees from 2011 to limit moral hazard problems.



Better alignment banks’ structure and crisis management/insolvency
frameworks. Supervisors should pay due attention to the legal structure of banking
groups and have power to direct banks to wind down subsidiaries and discontinue
certain activities.

25.
How much more of each of the above-measures is needed is a difficult question. This
will partly depend on where a future crisis would come and how it evolves under what
macroeconomic circumstances. However, it is likely that the resource needs for the
authorities (i.e., international reserves and public finance buffer) would be smaller, if banks’
capital and liquidity positions, as well as the supervision frameworks, are stronger.
Box 1. Credit Risk Indicators Used in This Attachment
This attachment employs various risk analytical tools, mostly developed by the IMF
Monetary and Capital Markets Department. Box 1 Figure 1 illustrates the relationship
among these various risk models.
Individual credit risk indicators


Distance to Default (DtoD). A market based default risk indicator, which measures the
number of standard deviations of asset (return) volatility from the default barrier for a
specific time horizon (one year is used in this attachment). For more details, see Sy
A.N.R., and J.A. Chan-Lau (2006).



Contingent Claims Approach (CCA). Based on Merton’s CCA (Merton, 1974) and
using balance sheet information on debt payments, as well as market data for equity
and equity volatility, the value of bank assets and asset volatility can be inferred, and
risk measures, such as default probabilities and expected default losses, can be
estimated. Moody’s KMV follows this approach and provides expected default
frequency.

Systemic risk models


Systemic CCA (Gray and Jobst, 2010 a. b., and c.). Because banks’ CDS spreads are
depressed due to government implicit and explicit guarantees, the difference between
equity market implied losses and CDS implied losses provides a measure of the
government’s contingent liabilities. Systemic CCA―risk-adjusted balance sheets for
the system of financial institutions―can provide estimates for total systemic losses,
systemic contingent liabilities, and tail risks.



Consistent Information Multivariate Density Optimizing (CIMDO) Approach
(Segoviano, 2006, and Segoviano and Goodhart, 2009). It uses CDS spreads to get
default probabilities and bank equity prices to calculate correlations. Risk measures
include Joint Probability of Default ―the probability that all the banks in the sample
portfolio default jointly―and the Systemic Relevance―the probability that all banks
in the sample default, conditional on the default of a specific bank. Note that CDS
implied default probabilities are net of the effect of government guarantees.

Balance sheet models


Network Approach. It simulates domino effects of the default of a specific bank or
economy on others. First, construct a matrix of inter-bank accounting exposures that
include gross financial exposures among them (e.g., BIS data), and then, simulate
shocks to a specific bank and track the domino effect on other banks. For more details,
see Espinosa and Solé (2010) and IMF Global Financial Stability Report,
October 2010.

Box 2. Cross-Border Banking Regulatory Framework in the EU
The home country principle characterizes the EU’s overall cross-border banking system
stability architecture. Banks are licensed, regulated, and supervised by their home country
supervisory authorities, and covered by the home country’s crisis management, crisis resolution,
deposit insurance, and insolvency frameworks. The home country principle also implies that a
subsidiary of the banking group should be supervised by the country in which it is registered as a
corporate entity and licensed. This means that different parts of the same banking group are covered
by different countries’ financial regulatory and safe net arrangements. Nevertheless, the home
country for the parent bank should be responsible for a consolidated supervision of a banking group
as a whole.
Crisis management arrangements in the EU are based on corporation and information
exchanges between partially harmonized national systems with cross border powers. A
framework for such corporation and information exchanges is established through largely nonbinding Memorandum of Understandings, including central banks and often Finance Ministries.
Beyond, there are neither formal frameworks for agreements on early intervention nor crisis
resolution, including burden sharing of potential fiscal costs.

ATTACHMENT III. WILL SWEDEN EXPERIENCE A JOBLESS RECOVERY?1
1.
Employment was unexpectedly resilient during the recession. Does this imply the rise
in employment will also be modest as the recovery takes hold? Encouraging signs have
emerged in recent months, but considerable uncertainty remains ahead in light of the external
environment. This note summarizes recent developments, highlights the importance of
reinforcing flexibility in the labor market in order to secure strong employment, and
discusses the settings for labor market arrangements necessary to achieve this.

of employment, has largely held up.
3.

Patterns elsewhere in Europe were similar (Figure 1).



The combined responses of hourly labor productivity and average hours worked were
large, reflecting the severity of the downturn. In many European countries (including
Sweden), labor productivity and average working hours decreased, while the decline
in permanent employment has been modest.



In contrast, large declines in employment and real wages occurred in the United
States, resulting in a rise in labor productivity relative to trend, an unusual
development during a recession.

1/ The series are normalized to 100 as at Q4-2007. As the current recession is highly schrnonimzed and many countries
entered into recession almost at the same time and assumed to be the start of the current recession. The labor market has
responded through several dimensions, which could be analyzed by decomposing the labor share of output into employment,
working hours, productivity, and real wages.

86


In face of external shocks, Swedish relative labor costs remained highly competitive.
Cost pressures arising from recent round of central wage agreements appear to be
low.

4.
So far, the labor market has fared better than in the previous recession in the
early 1990s (Figure 2). Jobless rate has been relatively modest, while labor productivity and
average working hours fell. The labor participation rate has also held up. And even
permanent employment—which had been steadily falling—has recently leveled off.
5.

A number of factors could explain these developments.



Recent structural reforms have improved labor market flexibility, which contribute to
strong labor force participation, more flexible wage negotiations, and improved flows
in the search and matching process (Text chart).2



The current recession has been driven largely by external shocks. But the depth and
duration of the shocks remain uncertain. Many firms chose to hoard labor given
flexibility to release them later if demand disappointed (without government support)
at the expense of falling productivity.



Public sector employment has also remained robust, unlike a sharp decline due to
notable fiscal consolidation in the previous crisis.



The flexibility of exchange rate may have sheltered part of the external shocks,
mitigating the impacts on domestic activities.

OECD recommendations

Actions taken by Swedish authority

Reduce marginal taxes on labor
income

Cut income taxes by raising the
threshold for the state income tax
or reduce its rate

Lower threshold for state income tax was
raised in 2009; employer social security
contributions were reduced and in-work tax
credit expanded through 2011.

Reform sickness and disability
benefit schemes

Introduce a time limit on eligibility
for sickness benefits without
reassessment and ensure local
insurance offices fully implement
tightened rules.

Tighten administration, time limits on
eligibility and measures for rehabilitation
have lowered sickness absence rates.

Reform employment protection
legislation

Encourage regular employment
by widening the definition of fair
dismissal and lengthening the trial
period of regular contracts.

No significant action on permanent
contracts but trial periods and duration of
temporary contracts were extended.

B. Is the Labor Market Flexible?
6.
Labor market flexibility can be measured by the turnover rates into and out of
unemployment. Higher flexibility is indicated if workers can move in and out of jobs
relatively easily within a short horizon, resulting high turnover into and out of unemployment
(here called inflow and outflow hazard rates). The analysis estimates the hazard rates for total
unemployment and youth unemployment based on the methodology proposed by Shimer
(2007) and Elsby et. al., (2008) (Appendix 1).
7.
This analysis suggests that the labor market has become more flexible. Estimated
flow hazard rates vary substantially across countries. The Anglo-Saxon and Nordic
(including Sweden) countries have the highest flow rates, while continental European
countries scored low on both inflow and outflow rates. Since the mid-1990s, Sweden has
undertaken reforms to improve labor market flexibility along the OECD recommendations,
and the improvement is partly reflected in the change of hazard flows (Text Figure).

8.
Youth unemployment hazard flows are more dynamic. Estimates of inflow and
outflow rates on unemployment are much higher for youths across all countries, as many of
them are in temporary or short-term employment.
9.
Flexibility in the labor market is closely linked to unemployment dynamics. A rise in
unemployment is generally preceded by an increase of inflow hazard, while the persistence
of changes in unemployment rate is usually driven by outflow hazard (Text Figure). Both
Granger causality tests and pair-wise correlation of the hazard rates show evidence of this
close relationship in many countries (including Sweden). In countries with high hazard rates,
changes in unemployment rates are largely driven by changes in the high outflow rates.

Counter factual scenarios illustrate how unemployment rates would have evolved if
the labor market conditions had not been as flexible as today. Specifically,


If the labor market conditions at the start of the recession had been similar to those in
the recession in early 1990s, unemployment rate would have risen to over 10 percent
and continued to deteriorating until mid-2011, before declining.



If the labor market conditions at the start of the recession had been similar to those in
Germany, unemployment rate would have risen more slowly but more persistently.



Alternatively, unemployment would have continued rising until end-2010 if the labor
market conditions today had been the same as those in the early 1990s. If the
conditions today were similar to Germany, the unemployment rate would remain at
high levels (over 8 percent) in the medium term.

C. Implications for the Outlook and Policies
11.

Considerable uncertainty remains.



Deterioration in Europe could weaken the economic outlook, forcing firms to
eventually release the hoarded labor during the past quarters. In that case, the
unemployment rate will rise again.



Past experience from countries with procylical labor productivity and working hours
suggests that the upturn could be weak or remain negative for some years as there
would be scope to raise output through returning average working hours and labor
productivity to their trend level before rehiring (OECD (2010).



Young workers have been more disproportionately affected in the downturns. The
youth unemployment rate rose to about 30 percent, more than three times than that of
the adult and at the high-end of the OECD average (Scarpetta et al (2010)). Estimates
using Okun’s Law suggest that changes of youth unemployment rate are about twice

90
as responsive as those for adults over business cycles.3 Many of them were under
temporary contracts and were among the first to be released in lay-offs.

unclear whether these programs are equally
effective during and after recessions (Kluve (2006), Martin (2000), OECD (2008)).

The methodology is the same as in the IMF (2010) World Economic Outlook Chapter 3. Results remain robust
on alternative estimation based on sub-sample after 1990s.

91
Box 1. Labor Market Programs across OECD countries
Public spending on labor market programs is broadly classified into ‘active’ and passive
measures according to the OECD database. The active labor market programs (ALMPs)

aim at improving the access to the labor market for the unemployed through job
training, placement services, and benefits administration. The major categories of ALMPs
include:


Public employment services and administration (PES) – activities of job placement,
administering unemployment benefits, and referrals for job-seekers to various
programs.



Labor market training – vocational and remedial training for the unemployed and
training for employed adults for labor market reasons.



Direct and subsidized employment – hiring subsidies paid to private sector employers,
assistance to the unemployed to start their own business, and direct job creation for the
unemployed in the public or private sectors.



Measures for the disabled - vocational rehabilitation and sheltered work programs.

The passive measures mostly relate to spending on income transfers. Two broad
categories under passive labor market programs (PLMPs) include unemployment benefits and
early retirement pensions paid for labor market reasons.
These ALMPs could increase overall employment through several channels. First, the
programs could achieve more efficient matching between job vacancies and unemployed
through improvements of skills through training and/or effective searching using employment
agencies. Second, labor productivity may increase owing to various training or at least prevent
productivity loss arising during long period of inactivity. Third, the job creation programs
under the ALMPs (e.g., direct subsidies to low-skill employment) could generate positive
externality to non-program participants, shifting the overall labor demand up and lifting
employment and wages.
Data on labor market policies are obtained from OECD database, which allows a comparable
study across advanced countries. Nevertheless, they only cover public spending and do not
include labor market policies financed by other means (e.g., private sector spending and special
payroll tax), and the duration and type of policies a typical unemployed enroll in. Some private
sector employers (e.g., Scania) have provided active measures to employees without
government support during the recession.

13.
A fresh examination of the impact of such policies on employment conducted during
this consultation finds that the effects of ALMPs and PLMPs tend to be stronger in the case
of Sweden than elsewhere (Table and Appendix 2).4 The coefficients on both interacting
terms on Sweden are significant, indicating stronger effects on total and private employment,
reflecting the possibility that the ALMPs are better targeted and tend to have a wider impact
in promoting employment.

14.
Expenditures on ALMPs in Sweden are mostly related to job search assistance,
employment incentives, and job training, which also appear to be those types of spending that
contribute to employment.


Job search assistance and start-up incentives. The results suggest broad significance
of PES and start-up incentives on total and private sector employment. The results are
in line with evaluations on other country studies, especially the programs on
investment in active placements and active monitoring on unemployed job search
efforts. However, much of this could simply reflect the fixed cost of running the PES
services as the data do not distinguish between these two spending.



Training. The estimates find some positive impact of training on total employment,
but it is uncertain whether the positive benefit outweighs the cost. Training accounts
for a major portion of the total spending on ALMPs (about 20 percent of total ALMPs
spending).



Employment incentives to private-sector employment. The estimation suggests
strongly significant impact of the subsidies in creating employment in the private
sector. These subsidies form a major share of the total ALMPs in Sweden. However,
other studies suggest the subsidies could carry large displacement effects and yield
small net employment gains.



Direct job creation. The estimation has ambiguous results in which the coefficients
are not significant, possibly due to displacement effects on a net basis.

15.
Robustness checks show similar results after accounting for endogeneity and policy
interaction. Unemployment and other related benefits provide income support while the
unemployed are seeking for jobs or enrolling in some active programs. A two-step estimation
is applied to control for possible interaction, first by obtaining the residuals from regressing
each type of ALMPs on PLMPs and then using them in the benchmark estimation.
Controlling for the interaction, the negative coefficients on PLMPs tend to be smaller but still
remain significant. In addition,
instrumental variables techniques (using

The estimates can be used to
evaluate the evolution of employment.
The estimated results appear to follow
closely to the actual employment rate.
Using the budgeted spending on labor
market policies and under certain
assumptions on structural variables, the
evolution of employment shows some
improvements in the medium-term.

78

94
17.
The analytical results, along with lessons from past experience, could help guide the
structural labor market policies in the current recession.


Evaluating effectiveness of active measures. A large share of public spending on
active measures has already been in the areas that are generally found to be more
effective. Further expansion of direct measures (e.g., tax incentives or discretionary
subsidies for firms to hoard labor) may only contribute marginally while they could
compromise efficiency.



Unwinding of temporary crisis measures. Temporary crisis measures introduced
during the recession would need to be timely unwound to avoid attenuating jobsearch incentives and trapping workers in reduced hours (e.g., marginal increase in
the level and/or duration of unemployment benefits).



Rebalancing of employment protection. Recommendations from the OECD on
rebalancing the employment protection between regular and temporary workers
would help improving the labor market structure.



Addressing the issue on youth unemployment. Policies could ensure better integration
between employment services and education system, including apprenticeship
training, referrals to PES from schools, and access to job-search assistance, in line
with the OECD recommendations.

United States labor market and modified by Elsby, Hobijn, and Shain (2008), and Arpaia and
Curci (2010)) in their applications to selected advanced countries. Quarterly data of total and
youth unemployment rates, along with annual data on labor force and unemployment by
duration are taken from the OECD analytics database and labor force surveys, which provide
a relatively standardized formulation in data collection from individual countries, facilitating
consistent cross-country comparison. The data span from 1968-2009 where available and
include 22 advanced countries in the OECD.
Workers are assumed to stay in one of two possible states (employed or unemployed) in a
given period (i.e. ignoring entering or withdrawing from labor force). The evolution of the
unemployment rate (ut) over time can be written as:
(1)
where w and q are the rate of inflow into and outflow from unemployment and t denotes time
periods (in months). Converting that to match the observed annual data frequency would
imply that
(2)
in which t is the annual rate of convergence. The equation relates
the variation in the unemployment u to variation in the underlying flow hazard rates w and q.
The monthly outflow probability W could be inferred based on the following identity that
shows monthly change in unemployment
where ut+1,1m denotes the stock of unemployed workers with duration less than 1 month, and
reflects the inflows into unemployment, while Qtut reflects the flows out of unemployment.
The hazard rate on outflow qt,m is related to the probability that unemployed workers exits
from unemployment within m months, in which it is a concave function in Q.
Where (qt,m) is the hazard rate associated with the probability that an unemployed worker at
time t completes the unemployment spell within the subsequent m months. If in case of
unemployment is duration dependent, estimates of outflow rate qt,m may not generate
consistent estimates of the aggregate outflow rate from unemployment, for example, a
negative duration dependence whereby the outflow rate would imply a decline with duration
qt,1m>qt,3m>qt,6m>qt,12m. Thus, a chi-squared test of hypothesis of no duration dependence is
conducted. For those countries that reject the hypothesis of no duration dependence, the
outflow hazard qt,1m is used as an estimate of unemployment outflow rate. For countries that
the hypothesis of no duration dependence is not rejected, additional unemployment duration
data are used to improve the precision of estimate of outflow hazard rate qt contained in
various horizons (3,6, and 12 months), optimally weighted according to minimizing the mean

97
squared error (see Elsby, Hobijn, and Shain (2008)). The estimate of inflow rate Is robust to
temporal aggregation bias in the measurement of unemployment inflows. Given the outflow
rate estimates q, the inflow rate w is computed using the method by Shimer (2007),
essentially is solving a non-linear equation as in (2).
To account for the decomposition of the contributions to the changes in unemployment
arising from outflow and inflow rates. Contemporaneous variation in unemployment rate is
driven both by contemporaneous and lagged variation in the hazard rates. Using the
methodology in Elsby et al (2007), we define the beta values to measure the contributions of
hazard rates out of steady states.
Where  denotes the cumulative contributions of contemporaneous and previous variations
in the hazard flows.
B. Appendix 2—Methodology in Estimation
The analysis examines if active measures have asymmetric impacts to employment. Existing
studies find mixed results on the effectiveness of ALMPs on employment, unemployment or
real wages. These inconclusive results are subject to various limitations. The proposed
analysis could address some of these shortcomings but could be subject to other limitations.
By focusing on various subsets of employment, the analysis can identify more precisely on
the effectiveness on each target group, avoid over-estimating the policy importance by
examining the net effect accounting for potential displacement effect of the ALMPs and by
excluding cyclical increase in public sector employment, which do not represent an
improvement in labor productivity or cost reductions. The analysis also introduces additional
terms as proxy for prolonged and deep recessions, which address whether the ALMPs have
similar effectiveness throughout the economic cycles.
The estimated equation could be interpreted as a reduced form of a model determining the
employment rates. The benchmark equation in the form of cross-country panel is:
+
where i and t denote time period (in years) and country. EMP denotes the employment in
question (i.e., youth, private-sector, and total employment) as a percent of respective labor
force. ALMP and PLMP are the public spending on active and passive labor market policies
as a share of GDP, respectively. X is a vector of control variables that capture institutional
variation and the business cycles. D is a vector of variables that contain year and countries
dummy (fixed effect panel estimation), where  is the error term. Control variables include
several institutional variables, including employment protection on regular and temporary
employment, gross benefits entitlements related to replacement effects, and labor union
participation. Lagged output growth rates are included to capture the variation due to cyclical
economic activities.

98
In general, the spending on ALMPs has contributed to an increase of total employment rate,
but not on youth employment rate (Table X). Coefficients on ALMPs are significant at
5 percent level at about 0.36 on total employment. The effects of ALMPs on youth and
private sector employment tend to be muted. Larger effect of ALMPs on total employment
could mean that the ALMPs tend to increase public-sector employment and do not have wide
impact on the overall labor market conditions. PLMPs have a consistent significant negative
effect on all employment rates (in line with Esteavo (2003), suggesting the expected reverse
causality. Control variables generally carry the expected signs. Difference in protection
between regular and temporary employment has a negative significant effect.
The effects of active market policies do not appear to be asymmetric over the economic
cycles. Interacting term that captures persistent downturn shows that the PLMPs tend to have
stronger negative impact on all subset of employment during persistent downturns, but no
notable differences on the effects from ALMPs on all of employment during the protracted
recessions.

99
ATTACHMENT IV: FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY
Baseline scenario
In the baseline scenario, the underlying fiscal position is projected to improve markedly over
the medium-term to over 1½ percent of GDP reflecting the impact of recent reforms to
reduce welfare expenditures. Given the stronger than expected fiscal balance during the
cyclical downturn in 2009–2010, the public debt-to-GDP ratio will peak earlier than
previously estimated by staff. It will decline from a high of 42.7 percent of GDP in 2010 to
32.7 percent of GDP in 2014. With a primary surplus of about 3 percent of GDP and a
declining public debt ratio in 2014, Sweden’s fiscal position is expected to remain strong.
In the alternative scenarios, a one time shock to contingent liabilities and lower-thanexpected output growth constitute the most important risks to the baseline scenario. Given
the relatively low level of public debt (42 percent of GDP in 2009) in the context of strong
fiscal performance in recent years, the impact of higher interest rate is projected to be small.
In addition, the portion of the government’s liabilities denominated in foreign currencies is
small at 20 percent share, which would imply a modest impact from a sudden depreciation in
the real exchange rate. A confluence of shocks—lower growth, higher real interest rates and
weaker primary balance—would pose some threats to the debt reduction plan but the impact
would remain modest at about 3 percent of GDP.
External risks


The impact of a permanent ½ standard-deviation shock to the interest rate—a
0.6 percentage point increase from the baseline—would increase public debt by
2 percentage points to 51 percent of GDP in 2014.



A one-time 30 percent depreciation in the REER (in 2011) would increase public
debt immediately, but only marginally—about 4 percentage points to 46 percent of
GDP. Debt would subsequently fall at a pace envisaged in the baseline to 36 percent
of GDP in 2014.



A one-time 10 percent of GDP shock to contingent liabilities (in 2011) would
increase public debt to 51 percent of GDP. Assuming the baseline case of speed of
debt reduction thereafter, public debt would lower to 41 percent of GDP in 2014
(about 10 percent of GDP higher than the baseline).

Domestic risks


A ½ standard deviation shock to primary balance, which lowers primary balance by
nearly 1 percent of GDP each year during the forecast period, would translate into a

100
more gradual debt reduction going forward. Debt in 2014 would be higher by
4½ percentage points of GDP (to 36 percent of GDP) in 2014 relative to the baseline.


A ½ standard deviation shock to growth would bring average projected annual
growth down by 0.8 percent. The impact on public debt is relatively large, raising it to
39 percent of GDP in 2014 due to adverse debt dynamics.



One-quarter standard deviation shocks to growth, real interest rate, and primary
balance (i.e., compared to the baseline, lowering output growth by 0.4 percent a year,
raising real interest rate by 0.35 percent a year, and reducing the primary balance by
½ percent of GDP a year) would bring public debt to 35 percent of GDP in 2014—an
increase of 3 percentage points of GDP from the baseline.

Public sector balance sheet
Despite the weaker underlying fiscal position over the medium-term reflecting fiscal
measures, Sweden’s current fiscal policies remain sustainable over the long-run. Sweden,
like most industrialized countries, faces significant challenges associated with population
aging that have significant budgetary implications. However, the projected increase in
spending with aging (2.6 percent of GDP) is relatively small compared to other European
countries (5.2 percent in the euro area). Using a public sector balance sheet approach to
calculate the long-run intertemporal financial position based on the staff baseline scenario
suggests that the net worth constraint continues to be met by 2060, albeit with a smaller
margin to absorb upside risks to the aging costs.

SWEDEN
Staff Report for the 2010 Article IV Consultation with Sweden
Supplementary Information
Prepared by the European Department
Approved by Anne-Marie Gulde-Wolf and Jan Kees Martijn
July 8, 2010
1.
This supplement provides an update on economic and policy developments in recent
weeks. Staff projections and the thrust of the staff appraisal remain unchanged.
2.
The Riksbank raised its policy rate by 0.25 percentage points to 0.5 percent on
July 1, the first increase since the global crisis. This decision reflected strong domestic
growth—particularly the resumption of export growth and rising household consumption—as
well as concerns about rising household indebtedness. However, the decision was balanced
by a postponement of projected further tightening, projections of a subsequent relaxation in
the event of further European strains, and dissent by two Monetary Policy Committee
members who called for the initial increase to be postponed.
3.
In this context, the Riksbank has revised upwards its baseline forecast since it
was last published in April (paragraph 20 of the staff report). It now projects a 3.8 percent
increase in real GDP in 2010—about 1½ percentage points stronger than in April—on
account of stronger anticipated recovery in export markets and stronger domestic demand.
Accordingly, the 90 percent confidence interval around the growth projection has risen and
narrowed—from -1 percent to 5 percent, to 2.1 percent to 5.4 percent. Projections for 2011
real GDP growth remained broadly unchanged at 3.6 percent, with a 90 percent confidence
interval ranging from 1 percent to 6.1 percent.
4.
The Ministry of Finance has also revised upward its growth forecast for 2010 by
nearly 1 percentage point (paragraph 27 in the staff report) —from the 2½ percent
presented in the Spring Policy Bill on May 15 to 3.3 percent—citing stronger growth and
labor market prospects. The period average unemployment rate has been revised down, from
9.2 percent and 8.8 percent respectively, in 2010 and 2011, to 8.9 percent and 8.4 percent.

Parliamentary and local elections will be held on 19 September 2010.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation with
Sweden
On July 14, 2010 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Sweden.1
Background
Sweden was hard hit by the great recession, but aggressive stabilization policies have
attenuated the downturn. Output contracted—by over 6 percent from peak to trough—on
the back of a sharp decline in exports and gross fixed capital formation; unemployment
rose to over 9 percent, its highest level since 1998; corporate financial positions—
notably of manufacturers—have deteriorated and the economy’s spare capacity is
considerably high. The policy response to the downturn was led by a sharp relaxation of
monetary policy bringing policy rates to their effective floors and a package of
emergency financial sector support measures. On the fiscal side, automatic stabilizers
were allowed to operate fully and discretionary fiscal policy focused on supporting labor
market participation, resulting in a fiscal relaxation of 3 percentage points of gross
domestic product (GDP) in 2009. Alongside, a 15 percent real effective depreciation of
the krona provided support to exporters and firms competing against imports.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings
up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
These steps have supported the economy and helped address downside tail risks. As
globally, earlier financial strains have eased and exit from financial sector support
measures has begun. Credit to households remained buoyant, and concerns with a
deflationary spiral have been erased with core inflation and inflation expectations
remaining close to the target. Moreover, personal consumption held up firmly and firms
hoarded labor to a greater extent than in the 1990s, preventing an even sharper
increase in unemployment. In this context output began to rise from mid-2009—led by
domestic demand—with the recovery becoming broader based in the first quarter of
2010 as exports picked up and inventories rose.
Nonetheless near term prospects for growth remain uncertain. They are very much
dependent on global demand for Sweden’s particular output bundle—investment and
intermediate goods and consumer durables—which is likely to lag in the recovery, as
well as market stress in Europe which has dented both growth prospects in a key export
market and reversed much of the earlier krona depreciation. Staff projects the economy
to grow by 3 percent in 2010.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors noted that the Swedish economy had been hit hard by the global recession,
and commended the authorities for their aggressive stabilization policies, which were
made possible by sound pre-crisis macroeconomic management. A sharp easing of
monetary policy, financial sector support measures and significant fiscal loosening have
cushioned the downturn in output and employment.
Directors noted that these policies have yielded fruit. Credit to households has remained
buoyant and personal consumption held up firmly, while concerns with a deflationary
spiral have abated. Output began to rise from mid-2009. Financial sector strains have
eased and exit from emergency financial sector support measures has begun.
Directors agreed that, despite the ongoing healthy recovery, near-term prospects for
growth remain uncertain. While the global growth outlook has improved, risks remain,
including from market stresses in Europe and the resulting “search for strong
sovereigns,” which has reversed much of the earlier krona depreciation attenuating
prospects for net exports and growth. Accordingly, Directors supported the authorities’
intentions to keep domestic policies supportive and encouraged them to respond flexibly
to evolving economic circumstances.
Directors welcomed the additional fiscal support to activity in the 2010 budget and
envisaged for 2011, notably via full operation of the large automatic stabilizers and the
planned discretionary stimulus. This responds to output concerns and is consistent with
fiscal sustainability. Moreover, the composition of the discretionary component will
continue to boost supply-side efficiencies. Directors encouraged the authorities to stand
ready to reconsider the fiscal stance for 2011 if the outlook for growth turns out stronger

3
than expected. They noted the central role of the Council for Fiscal Policy in ensuring
the credibility of the fiscal framework.
Directors noted that the recent policy rate increase by 25 basis points still leaves the
stance of monetary policy appropriately accommodative. Given the large output gap and
recent krona strength, the tightening cycle should be gradual and cautious.
Directors encouraged continued efforts to secure financial sector stability. Recent stress
tests indicated that regulatory capital requirements continue to be comfortably met by all
institutions. Moreover, the recent Financial Supervisory Authority’s proposal to cap loanto-value ratios should help to address vulnerabilities. Nevertheless, risks remain,
including from banking operations abroad and from liquidity operations in euro and
dollar markets, which should be adequately reflected in capital and liquidity
requirements in line with forthcoming global agreements. Directors also encouraged
continued efforts to strengthen cross-border resolution frameworks in line with EU
proposals.
Directors welcomed the initiative to undertake a review of the current toolkit of
supervisory intervention as part of contingency planning. Key issues to be addressed
include verifying the adequacy of the level of international reserves, establishing a
special resolution regime to manage troubled institutions, and increasing the Financial
Supervisory Agency’s capacity.

Statement by Per Callesen, Executive Director for Sweden
and Martin Holmberg, Advisor to Executive Director
July 14, 2010
1.
First, the Swedish authorities convey their appreciation to staff for constructive
discussions in Stockholm and for a well-drafted report. They broadly agree with staff’s
overall assessment of the Swedish economy in the near term. The downturn following the
financial crisis was successfully mitigated by aggressive stabilization policies and the
Swedish economy is now recovering strongly. However, the authorities’ view is, in general,
more optimistic than staff’s regarding the prospects for growth in 2010 and especially in
2011. This can be explained by revised GDP data but also economic indicators pointing to a
better outcome. The authorities agree with staff to keep policies supportive, but as the
economy recovers, monetary policy will need to become less expansionary. Staff concluded
that establishing a special resolution regime to manage troubled financial institutions and to
further raise resources for banking supervision would be welcome. Currently, the authorities
are working on enhancing the regulatory framework in order to improve the ability to uphold
financial stability and to reduce the potential costs for society.
Near term outlook and risks
2.
The authorities agree with staff’s broad near term picture of the Swedish economy;
that Sweden was hit hard by the global downturn but is recovering, helped by expansionary
economic policy. However, staff projections of GDP growth are on average more
pessimistic. Staff’s forecast of 3 percent GDP growth in 2010 is lower than authorities’
forecasts, of around 3½ percent, which were recently updated in light of newly released data.
Staff projections for GDP growth in 2011 is 1.9 percent which is almost 2 percentage points
lower than those of the authorities. This may stem from different views concerning the
recovery dynamics, where the authorities expect higher domestic demand as a result of the
marked increase in business and consumer confidence and other economic indicators
pointing to stronger development. In 2010, staff’s forecast for exports and investments is
lower and in 2011 staff expects lower private consumption and lower investments, but higher
public consumption.
3.
Staff is also slightly more pessimistic than the authorities regarding the labor market.
The downturn in the labor market was relatively limited given the large fall in GDP in
2008–09, but unemployment still shifted markedly upwards. There are, however, already
signs that the demand for labor is improving. Most importantly, employment is now
increasing steadily and unemployment has started to decline from an elevated level.
Expansionary financial conditions helped support consumption, which likely bolstered
employment in the service sector. The manufacturing sector on the other hand has been hit
harder by the downturn in world trade.

2
4.
Recent data shows that Sweden is currently one of the fastest growing economies in
Europe. There was a broad upturn in all GDP components during the first quarter this year.
Employment has also been on an upward trend for the past year. The authorities expect that
this trend, coupled with already strong optimism among companies and households, will help
maintain domestic demand.
5.
The authorities agree with staff that the Swedish krona is likely to appreciate in the
years to come. We take note that staff suggests that the weakening of Swedish exports due to
the downturn of global demand and the composition of Swedish exports combined with
population ageing have lowered the equilibrium real exchange rate.
6.
The authorities agree with staff that considerable uncertainties about the outlook
remain. Here, the authorities acknowledge both upside and downside risks. Sweden’s public
finances are sound, but unfavorable developments of public finances elsewhere may result in
heightened financial market stress and reduced external demand. In such a case, monetary
policy will have to be more expansionary than otherwise to accommodate growth. If, on the
other hand, households use more of their savings, which are at a historically high level, this
may lead to stronger domestic demand and monetary policy will have to become less
expansionary earlier on.
7.
In line with staff comments, the authorities acknowledge that house price inflation is
notable. They continue to follow developments in the housing market closely. There are
models which indicate that Swedish house prices are overvalued. However, there is no
consensus on the size of the gap between market prices and model-based house prices. The
gap suggested by staff is not applicable in Sweden’s case as Sweden has a regulated
residential rental market. There are also methods which indicate that house prices are not
overvalued at all, but in fact are slightly undervalued. The development in the housing
market is a concern for consumer and macroeconomic stability reasons rather than financial
stability reasons.
Financial sector policy and framework
8.
The authorities agree with staff’s view of a continuous need and scope for financial
stimulus for 2010–2011. We share the concern of the possible impact of the turbulence and
fiscal tightening in the European markets on the Swedish economy and financial sector.
However, the direct impact from current woes of some peripheral euro area countries is
expected to be small.
9.
Regulatory arrangements are now being introduced to curtail public capital and
liquidity dependence in the Swedish financial sector. The prolongation of the Debt Guarantee
Program involves stricter conditions such as increased pricing and requirements to establish
viability reviews. Additionally, as banks’ opportunities to obtain funding have continued to
improve, the Riksbank has ceased to offer loans at maturities of both three and six months.

3
Loans with one-month maturity will be offered until October. This should be considered as a
further step in the phase-out of the Riksbank's liquidity support measures.
10.
The authorities agree with staff that this crisis has exposed many weaknesses of the
financial system and that many countries for this reason have to rebuild their financial
sectors. In this context, it is further observed that Sweden must address special concern to
risks arising from large regional exposures and the need for a special resolution framework.
In the aftermath of the crisis it will be necessary to evaluate the functioning and effectiveness
of the financial sector and the public safety net in order to address proven weaknesses. We
will therefore continue to adjust and strengthen our financial stability framework, both at a
national and cross-border level.
11.
During the past two years the Swedish authorities have adopted a number of targeted
measures to mitigate the negative effects of the financial crisis. Although these measures
have been effective in the short run there are still areas that need to be clarified, i.a. the
division of roles between relevant authorities and the regulation for distressed financial
institutions. The Swedish authorities are determined to establish a coherent and effective
regulatory framework that will contribute to maintaining financial stability and to minimizing
costs to both the economy and consumers. The planned Swedish public inquiry commission,
mentioned in the staff report, is an important step in this direction.
12.
Likewise, many adjustments are already ongoing at an EU-level. In accordance with
the 2008 EU MoU, Sweden, together with the Nordic and Baltic countries, is currently
setting up a Cross Border Stability Group to enhance our preparedness for managing a crisis
in any of our common international banking groups. To facilitate coordination the group has
agreed on a number of crisis management procedures and prepared for a clear division of
roles and responsibilities between the authorities and ministries.
Fiscal policy and framework
13.
The government broadly agrees with staff’s view of the Swedish fiscal position and
the fiscal policy stance in the current economic situation. As is pointed out by staff, Sweden
was hit hard by the international downturn with output falling more than 6 percent in real
terms from peak to trough. Nevertheless, a strong fiscal starting position permitted the
government to let the automatic stabilizers operate fully, and in addition allowed a series of
discretionary measures without putting sustainable fiscal policy at risk. Besides structural tax
cuts, these measures include increased municipality grants – preventing the municipalities to
act pro-cyclically, and increased resources to the labor market – preventing people from
becoming long-term unemployed and improving conditions for those most detached from the
labor market. Even after taking these measures, public finances remain strong.
14.
We welcome staff’s overall favorable assessment of the Swedish fiscal framework.
An important policy principle in a severe recession is keeping public finances in good order

4
to ensure that the deficits are temporary and manageable. In this way, households and firms
can continue to have confidence in economic policy and the foundation on which welfare
rests. The government also shares staff’s view on the important role played by the Fiscal
Policy Council in assessing policy and compliance with the framework. There are no plans at
present to change the role of the Council.
15.
The world is now tentatively emerging from the worst economic crisis since the
1930s. Sweden's path forward for exit from the crisis involves nurturing the recovery,
reinforcing the jobs policy, and safeguarding public finances. With a rapid return to surplus
in the public finances in line with budget policy objectives, Sweden will be able to face new
crises and long run challenges like an ageing population from a position of strength. This will
also help to maintain confidence in fiscal policy, which is required to ensure sustainable
public finances in the long run. As a result of the improved economic outlook, public
finances are expected to move into surplus in 2012.
16.
As pointed out by staff, there is a risk that developments could be worse than
expected. Although the government’s view is that the envisaged discretionary stimulus
planned for 2010–11 appropriately balances the risks, the government is following
developments carefully and is prepared to take further measures as necessary.
Monetary policy and framework
17.
We welcome staff’s conclusion that the authorities successfully have headed off
earlier considerable disinflation concerns. According to the Riksbank’s latest forecast,
inflation will initially be held back due to higher productivity growth and a stronger krona.
As unit labor costs rise more quickly and economic activity strengthens, inflation will rise.
During the Riksbank’s forecast period until mid-2013, CPI inflation will be slightly higher
than 2 percent, while underlying (CPIF) inflation will be slightly lower than 2 percent.
Inflation expectations remain steady around the target in the long run.
18.
The authorities agree with staff that inflation pressures are low at the moment, but
inflation is expected to increase as economic activity strengthens. The Executive Board of the
Riksbank therefore decided on June 30 to raise the repo rate by 0.25 percentage points to
0.5 percent. The Riksbank agrees with staff that the tightening cycle should be gradual. The
published repo rate path shows a gradual normalization of the repo rate in order to attain the
inflation target and keep the real economy stable. Monetary policy is set to remain supportive
of growth, in line with staff’s appraisal.
19.
Regarding extraordinary measures, the Riksbank has followed two basic principles:
that they should not replace effectively functioning markets and that loans should be granted
against collateral and at the repo rate with a surcharge. The Riksbank’s exit is therefore fairly
uncomplicated compared with e.g. the unwinding of large-scale asset purchases necessary in

5
several other countries. Also contributing to the normalization of monetary policy is that the
first of the three fixed-interest rate loans granted to the banks in 2009 matured on June 30.
20.
Staff notes the need to update "war games" to verify contingency plans and states it
would be useful to confirm that international reserves are at appropriate levels. Should a
more negative growth scenario materialize, the Riksbank stands ready to reintroduce
extra-ordinary measures. The Riksbank welcomes staff’s conclusion that abolishing the
+/-1 percent tolerance interval around the inflation target in June was consistent with
accountability.
