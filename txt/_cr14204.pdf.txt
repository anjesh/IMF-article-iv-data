STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
June 17, 2014

KEY ISSUES
Setting: The seeds of good governance and prudent macroeconomic and natural
resources management planted by the Botswana authorities paid off with an impressive
increase in the GDP per capita during the last three decades. However, as in many other
small middle-income countries (SMICs) in the region, trend growth has softened in
recent years, reflecting the decline in the contribution of total factor productivity (TFP) to
growth which calls for policies to reduce structural bottlenecks in the economy.
Current conditions and outlook: Botswana’s economy remains broadly internally and
externally balanced and the authorities’ near-term macroeconomic policy mix is
appropriate. Output growth is expected to slowdown in 2014 reflecting partly
weaknesses in the non-mineral sector, while inflation is expected to remain within the
Bank of Botswana’s (BoB) medium-term objective range of 3-6 percent.
Fiscal policy: Staff supports the FY2014/15 budget, which reins in unproductive current
spending, while protecting growth-promoting capital spending. Achieving medium-term
fiscal consolidation objectives adopted in the budget, would require articulating
concrete measures to reduce the wage bill relative to GDP and broaden the revenue
base.
Financial sector development: Botswana’s banking system is well-capitalized and
profitable with relatively low nonperforming loans. Although from a low base, credit
growth to households continues to expand at a high rate, which poses potential
vulnerabilities for the financial sector. Thus, staff recommends that macro prudential
measures be considered to temper the rate of growth of household borrowing. In this
context, staff welcomes the government’s emphasis on enhancing greater financial
deepening and inclusion, while preserving the stability of the financial system.
Reinvigorating growth: Returning to an era of strong growth and accelerating
Botswana’s convergence to higher income levels would require policies to reinvigorate
TFP growth. These include improving the quality of public spending, notably in public
investment projects and education to ensure the transformation of diamond wealth into
sustainable assets. The authorities’ efforts to improve the country’s competitiveness,
including through reducing the regulatory burden on firms, is also welcomed.
Past advice: There is broad agreement between the Fund and the authorities on the
macroeconomic policy stance and structural reform policy priorities. Consistent with
staff’s advice, the FY 2014/15 budget outlined a framework to reduce the burden of lossmaking state-owned enterprises on fiscal resources and propel them toward commercial
viability. Furthermore, the budget includes medium-term projections of government
accounts, as recommended by staff during past consultations. However, progress
towards reducing the wage bill relative to GDP remains modest.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK, AND RISKS
A. Challenges and Opportunities
1.
Botswana, has over the years, been one of Africa’s success stories; however, poverty
and unemployment remain relatively high with the country’ income inequality being among
the highest in the world (Figure 1).


GDP per capita more than quintupled during the last three decades and the country has earned
a good reputation in the areas of governance and prudent management of natural resources.
The government was also successful in increasing the literacy rate of the population.



Despite the strong growth performance, Botswana is still some way from meeting the objectives
of poverty elimination and reduced inequality. Poverty rate remains high at about 19 percent
and Botswana is among the most unequal countries in the world with a Gini coefficient over
0.60. In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) Botswana scores well in terms of the level of human
development index (HDI), including the level of education and absolute poverty. However, the
improvement in the HDI has been very small over the last decade and Botswana also lags
behind its peers outside the region (Figure 1).



Moreover, driven by the decline in TFP growth, trend growth has slowed down amidst
persistently high rate of structural unemployment. 1 The skill mismatch in the labor market
remains a perennial challenge despite the fact that significant resources have been invested by
the government in education.

2.
The government is aware of the economy’s challenges, and the recent Mid-Term
Review (MTR) of the 10th National Development Plan (NDP 10) serves as the blueprint for
structural transformation. The policy thrust of the MTR of NDP10 is reducing the size of the
government relative to GDP so that the private sector can take the lead in driving growth. NDP 11,
which is under preparation, is being framed around policies to boost economy-wide productivity,
enhance financial inclusion, and reduce the high unemployment rate to pave the way for higher,
sustainable, and more inclusive growth. The government’s Vision 2016 aims at “prosperity for all”,
with the goals of: poverty eradication; a more equitable distribution of income; and rapid economic
growth and diversification.

B. Current Conditions and Macroeconomic Policy Mix
3.

Under current conditions the economy remains internally and externally balanced.



Botswana is undergoing a cyclical recovery in line with its major trading partners and the output
gap is largely closed. The economy grew by 5.9 percent in 2013, driven by the recovery in the

1

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BOTSWANA

mining sector, while the nonmineral sector slowed down, partly reflecting power and water
supply disruptions (Figure 2 and Table 1).


Inflation decelerated significantly in 2013 and stayed well within the BoB’s medium-term
objective range (Figure 2). Staff endorses the BoB’s broadly neutral monetary policy stance as
reflected in the April 2014 Monetary Policy Committee decision. The monetary policy committee
(MPC) statement by the BoB in December 2013 reinforced an existing measure on the floor on
deposits that required banks to offer and publish a 91-day deposit at the minimum, 4 percent
per annum, with commensurate higher interest rates for longer-dated deposits in order to boost
savings and protect the interest of depositors.



The government recorded a small surplus in FY 2013/14. The budget surplus was achieved
through reining in current expenditure, higher mining revenue, and an increase in the Bank of
Botswana’s profit transfer (Table 2b). Staff supports the FY2014/15 budget, which reins in
unproductive elements of current spending, while protecting growth-promoting capital
spending. While the current size of the Pula Fund is adequate for stabilization purposes, the
envisaged accumulation of additional savings from non-renewable resource revenues is
desirable from an intergenerational equity perspective.



The current account balance turned into a surplus in 2013 supported by a rebound in diamond
exports. Imports continued to grow partly attributed to the increased electricity imports.

4.
Botswana’s external position remains broadly sound. Staff’s econometric analysis, using
CGER-like methods, which incorporate features appropriate for a mineral-based economy like
Botswana, shows that the real effective exchange rate (REER) is broadly in line with macroeconomic
fundamentals from a medium-term perspective (Appendix I). While other methods suggest a mild
undervaluation, the two most relevant approaches to Botswana’s natural resource-rich economy, the
macroeconomic balance and the external sustainability approaches, give point estimates that are
not significantly different from zero. Moreover, Botswana’s reserves are well above the adequate
range suggested by the Fund’s new metric for reserve adequacy (SM/13/22).2 Non-price
competitiveness indicators suggest that Botswana performs well relative to its peers, but some
challenges remain, most notably in the areas of education and skills shortage. Overall external
stability is also affected by the lack of export diversification, which leaves Botswana’s economy
vulnerable to sustained fluctuations in the international demand for diamonds.
5.
The banking system is well capitalized, profitable and liquid, but rapid growth of
credit and the non-bank financial sector represent concerns. While decelerating, credit to
households continued to grow at about 24 percent—which is among the highest growth in the
region (Figure 2). The increase, however, is from a low base. Banks’ nonperforming loans (NPLs)
doubled to 5.3 percent in December 2013 (Table 7) driven by the deterioration in the asset quality of
banks’ loans to corporate borrowers (although this is also from a low base). The nonbank financial

liquid and readily available for stabilization purposes.

institutions (NBFIs) sector has also been growing rapidly in recent years. Total assets of NBFIs
account for about 50 percent of GDP. Furthermore, the cross linkages between NBFIs and the
commercial banks (NBFIs wholesale deposits constitute about 40 percent of banks’ liabilities) have
increased in recent years, which could propagate and amplify system-wide contagion.

C. Outlook and Risks
6.
Outlook: Real GDP growth is expected to moderate to 4.4 percent in 2014, reflecting the
slowdown in diamond recovery and continued problems in the electricity and water supply (Table 1).
Subsequently, growth is expected to stabilize around 4 percent in the medium-term, with
slightly higher growth in the non-mining sector as the bottlenecks in the energy sector are
removed. Headline inflation is likely to remain within the BoB’s medium-term objective range in
2014. The current account surplus is projected to stabilize at around 2 percent of GDP supported by
the planned fiscal consolidation and the expected recovery in diamond exports.
7.

Risks:



The uncertain external environment, such as the potential slowdown in emerging markets, poses
downside risks to mineral export demand. Although significant progress has been made in
negotiations with the EU and the authorities are optimistic about reaching an agreement,
Botswana could lose all its preferential trade access to the EU market in October 2014, if they fail
to reach agreement with the EU on the economic partnership agreement.3 Under some adverse
scenarios, output growth could be lower by 1–1½ percentage points compared with the
baseline forecast (Appendix II). If further adverse global spillovers beyond the staff’s baseline
scenario lead to a decline in diamond prices and a significant loss of revenues, staff advised the
authorities to allow the automatic stabilizers to work on the revenue side. Botswana has ample
reserves and the debt level is very low. Such a policy response would avoid a procyclical fiscal
stance and only slightly delay the envisaged pace of fiscal consolidation in the FY2014/15
budget without posing risks to both medium-term fiscal and external sustainability.



On the domestic front, delays in the full commencement of the Morupule B power plant pose an
additional risk. The current problems with power and water supply have the potential to unravel
the ongoing recovery, including through the negative impact on investor sentiment. Although
the level of household indebtedness does not give rise to an imminent macroeconomic and
financial stability risk, the continued high rate of growth of household borrowing poses a
potential risk to consumer welfare and could generate vulnerabilities in the financial sector.
A key medium-term risk relates to the sustainability of long-term growth, which relies on
removing the existing structural bottlenecks and on finding new growth drivers.

However, Botswana’s export to the EU is only about 5 percent of the total export base.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
The authorities largely agreed with the staff’s assessment of recent economic developments, outlook,
and prospects. They acknowledged the need to reduce the size of the government (as a share of GDP).
In light of Botswana’s challenges, this year’s consultation focused on three main themes: (i) costefficient and growth-friendly fiscal consolidation; (ii) preserving financial stability, while promoting
financial inclusion; and (iii) raising economy-wide productivity growth to lift up potential growth over
the medium term.

A. Policy Theme 1: Cost-Efficient and Growth-Friendly Fiscal Consolidation
8.
The authorities’ gradual fiscal consolidation strategy is appropriate given the
uncertain external environment and the existing policy space. 4 This would bring the nonmineral
primary balance (NMPB) closer to its long-term sustainable level of about 5 percent of nonmineral
GDP. 5 The emphasis on improving the performance of state owned enterprises (SOE) is also well
placed. In line with staff advice, the inclusion of a medium-term projection for the government
accounts in the FY2014/15 budget is welcomed.
9.
Achieving targets in the government’s medium-term fiscal framework would require
implementing concrete measures to reduce the wage bill relative to GDP, broaden the tax
base, and improve the quality of government spending.


Despite the modest wage awards by the government in recent years (3-4 percent) and the
de facto hiring freeze (except for teachers and nurses), the wage bill continues to be high
reflecting the impact of promotions, re-grading, non-wage allowances, and overtime. The
policy measures that staff has recommended to the authorities include in the short-term—
streamlining the system of nonwage payments and including tighter eligibility criteria for
allowances. Over the medium-term—rationalizing the size and structure of government,
tightening the link between pay and performance, and strengthening payroll systems should
be considered.



The change in the VAT registration threshold initiated in the FY2014/15 budget will support
the authorities’ objective to simplify the existing tax system. However, further VAT
exemptions could undermine the government’s objective of broadening the tax base and
simplifying the tax system. There is in general a need for the government to rationalize
existing tax incentives and avoid granting unwarranted preferential tax regimes for
businesses. Given the recent improvements in Botswana Unified Revenue Service’ (BURS)
information technology system, staff believes that a comprehensive study on tax
expenditures that would inform policymakers about the magnitude of tax revenue that is
lost through tax incentives can now be done easily and should be of high priority for the

4

Botswana’s debt ratio has been historically very low and is expected to decline over the medium term—see the
annex on the debt sustainability analysis (DSA) using the new market access DSA template.

government. The estimated value of the forgone tax revenues of the existing tax incentives
should also provide a solid foundation for future policy decisions on net reductions in tax
expenditures.


The expansion of social welfare programs, including the feeding programs, the Old Age
Pension program, the Orphan Care program, and the Program for Destitute Persons, has
helped to reduce poverty significantly. However, the authorities should make these
programs more targeted since income inequality remains very high. The government’s
efforts to improve the quality of spending on health and education and make them more
targeted are also essential for reducing income inequality. And existing redistributive
policies should try to minimize the adverse effects on incentives to work, save, and invest.



The continued privatization and merger of some of the SOEs would help to reduce their
reliance on public resources. In addition, guidance developed by the Public Enterprise
Evaluation and Privatization Agency for overseeing the performance of SOEs and efforts to
reform SOEs governance structure to increase their accountability and set clear performance
targets would increase efficiency of SOEs and contain their cost.

10.
The authorities affirmed their medium-term fiscal consolidation goals, centered on
reining in unproductive elements of current expenditures. They agreed with the need to address
the size of the government (as a share of GDP) and are exploring ways to gradually reduce its size.
They noted that the outsourcing of low-skilled government services has not significantly reduced
the wage bill as some of the affected employees have been redeployed to other government
departments. The government also hired new personnel to fill up positions in recently completed
infrastructure projects such as schools and hospitals. The authorities’ approach to the SOEs focuses
on reducing overlaps among them, optimizing the use of resources, and improving shareholders’
oversight. They are also exploring sustainable ways to rationalize the large scale discretionary tax
incentives.

B. Policy Theme 2: Strengthening the Monetary Regime, the Transmission
Channel and Enhancing Financial Stability
11.
The authorities and staff agreed that Botswana’s crawling peg arrangement has served
as a good anchor for monetary and financial stability, and merits continued support. The
crawling peg provides some element of exchange rate flexibility to absorb shocks, while avoiding
the challenges of a fully flexible exchange rate regime in shallow markets. Staff encourages the
authorities to continuously look for opportunities to further strengthen the operational aspects of
the exchange rate framework, including regularly updating the optimality of the currency basket6,
and deepening money and foreign currency markets. Steps toward capacity building would also
strengthen monetary policy operations and put the authorities in a position of strength in the longrun if and when the economy becomes more diversified and they decide to move to a more flexible
exchange rate regime.

The authorities published the weights of the pula currency basket and the rate of crawl in the FY 2013/14 budget.

BOTSWANA

12.
The concentrated banking system could contribute to the weakening of the monetary
transmission channel and have potential negative implications for consumer welfare. A floor
on a deposit rate may in some circumstances mitigate problems due to such banking system
concentration. However, a binding floor on 91-days and longer maturity deposit rates combined
with a moratorium on increasing banks’ fees for two years, could also create distortions in the
financial system, and may not address the underlying inefficiencies in the banking system. Thus, the
BoB should continue to be vigilant to monitor, identify, and address unintended negative
consequences of these policies. Staff is of the view that positive real deposit rates will support
financial inclusion and could be achieved through the BoB’s liquidity management framework.
13.
The authorities emphasized that in light of the perceived high level of commercial
banks’ charges in Botswana, the aim of the floor on deposit rate and moratorium on
increasing banks’ fees is to provide consumer protection. In addition, this would encourage
banks to increase intermediation and move away from non-interest income towards interest income.
The Bankers Association of Botswana is planning to conduct a survey to compare bank charges in
Botswana with those in other countries. Furthermore, the BoB established a consumer protection
unit in its banking supervision department that aims to enhance the BoB’s efforts towards better
consumer protection.
14.
While Botswana’s banking system is well-capitalized and profitable, striking a balance
between financial inclusion and stability remains a challenge.


Staff recommends that the authorities consider using macro-prudential measures to contain the
growth of household borrowing, including a tighter debt to income ratio, and assigning higher
risk weights on unsecured lending to households. Data gaps in capturing household borrowing
outside the banking system need to be addressed to make macro-prudential tools more
effective. The continued rapid increase in the household borrowing is a potential vulnerability to
the financial sector.7 Discussions with the banks suggest that some households are already
beginning to experience difficulties in repaying their debt, although this is not widespread. The
situation would likely be amplified in the event of a return to a period of high interest rates since
a vast majority of loans to households are contracted at floating rates.



Given the size of the nonbanking financial sector and the cross linkages between non-bank
financial institutions (NBFIs) and the commercial banks, the authorities should also continue to
strengthen the regulation of NBFIs and support capacity building in the Non-Bank Financial
Institutions Regulatory Agency (NBFIRA).

15.
The authorities, who have been exploring options to promote financial inclusion,
should make sure to do so in a stability-friendly way.8 International experience suggests that
7

Due to capacity constraints in the non-bank financial institutions regulatory agency, the part of the households’
debt that is contracted from micro-lenders is not yet fully captured by the regulator.
8

Financial deepening and inclusion still remain low by international standards. About 60 percent of population still
remains unbanked (does not have an account at a bank) and small and medium sized enterprises face higher
financing constraints than in the other middle-income countries.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BOTSWANA

special programs to increase access to credit through public sector institutions have been costly
with little sustained impact. In contrast, actions that lower intermediation costs to maximize the
welfare gains from financial inclusion, while preserving financial stability, on balance tend to have
more sustained impact. This includes by addressing the perennial financing constraints facing small
and medium sized enterprises (access to finance, including for SMEs, was emphasized in the 2007
FSAP report on Botswana).9 The critical policies would include: promoting competition, enhancing
domestic supervision, boosting the use of technological innovation, and strengthening the
regulatory and supervisory framework for financial services. Establishing a national credit bureau
would also improve the screening of borrowers and reduce the risk of adverse selection.
16.
The authorities agreed that the level of household debt in an environment of slow
growth is a cause for concern. They highlighted that overall credit growth is decelerating and
while current indicators, such as low default ratios, suggest that widespread default risks are not
imminent, the related emerging debt repayment burden for households warrants close attention.
However, they emphasized that banks in Botswana remain well capitalized with low level of NPLs
and are in a position to absorb potential losses from asset quality deterioration. In addition, the BoB
signaled its intention to keep the current 100 percent risk weight on banks’ unsecured credit, which
is above Basel II requirements. They also argued that the portion of the household borrowing that is
not captured by the non-bank regulator is small. Moreover, the government is conducting a
diagnostic study of the current credit reporting system in Botswana to identify the gaps, and provide
recommendations on improving the credit reporting environment. The authorities are aware of the
capacity constraints in NBFIRA and continue to strengthen its skill base and regulatory infrastructure
with the support of the African Development Bank.

C. Policy Theme 3: Raising Productivity—A Key Driver of Long-Term
Growth Prospects
17.
Returning to an era of strong growth and accelerating Botswana’s convergence to a
higher income level would require policies to reinvigorate total factor productivity. As noted
above, skills mismatches and problems with SME access to finance are important structural
bottlenecks, and peer comparisons also point to problems with adequate access to electricity and
with bureaucratic procedures needed to start a business (Figure 4). The authorities should thus focus
on: (i) improving the quality of public spending, most notably on education to minimize the skill
mismatch in the labor market and on the public investment program to provide the needed
infrastructure in a timely manner10; (ii) reducing further the regulatory burden on firms; and (iii)
improving SME’s access to finance.
18.
The efficiency gains from higher total factor productivity would enhance prospects for
successful economic diversification. The authorities’ diversification strategy aims to leverage
Botswana’s areas of comparative advantage. Given the country’s well-established infrastructure for
9

In Mauritius, the ministry of finance in close coordination with the central bank provided a framework through
which finance could be extended to SMEs by banks on favorable terms and conditions in a market conforming
manner.

mineral development, a focus on expanding the mineral product space beyond diamonds, and
including downstream sectors, could have relatively large employment multipliers. The authorities’
efforts to improve the quality of Botswana’s institutions and improve the skill base of the labor force
could also enhance prospects for development of the knowledge-based service sectors.
19.
The authorities noted that the recent MTR of NDP 10 aims to address Botswana’s long
term challenges. A skills development policy has been announced in the FY2014/15 Budget. To
enhance competitiveness and doing-business in Botswana, the government in collaboration with the
World Bank is also implementing several projects under the Economic Diversification and
Competitiveness Program that include: streamlining business registration, licensing and issuance of
permits; establishment of e-Government policies and standards, including through one stop shop;
and capacity building to support monitoring and evaluation of the national strategies and policies.

D. Other Surveillance Issues
20.
Data quality is broadly adequate for surveillance, although there is room for
improvement. While Statistics Botswana continues to make steady progress, challenges remain in
the area of having a representative coverage of national accounts surveys and in estimating the GDP
deflators. Best practice would also suggest the rebasing of the national accounts about every five
years.11 The compilation of the balance of payments statistics could be improved, including the data
coverage on trade in services. Improving the quality of labor market statistics is key to assessing the
impact of government policies on job creation. In line with some of its peers, staff commends
Botswana’s plans to work towards subscribing to the IMF’s Special Data Dissemination Standard

STAFF APPRAISAL
21.
Botswana’s economic performance has been remarkable thanks to the authorities’
good governance and prudent management of natural resources. However, in recent years,
trend growth has softened in the midst of high unemployment and income inequality.
22.
The mid-term review (MTR) of the 10th National Development Plan (NDP10) serves as
the authorities’ blueprint for structural transformation. Staff welcomes the MTR of NDP 10,
which reemphasizes the need to reduce the size of government relative to GDP so that the private
sector can take the lead in generating economic growth.
23.
Under current conditions the economy is broadly internally and externally balanced
and the authorities’ near-term macroeconomic policy stance is appropriate. Overall external
stability is, however, affected by the lack of export diversification, which leaves Botswana’s economy
vulnerable to fluctuations in the international demand for diamonds.

10

Improving the quality of the public investment program is essential for transforming the existing natural resource
endowments into sustainable assets.
11

Botswana rebased its GDP in 2012 to a base year of 2006.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

BOTSWANA

24.
Staff welcomes the authorities’ medium-term fiscal strategy. The emphasis on
rebuilding the Pula Fund and improving the performance of state owned enterprises is well placed.
Improving the quality of spending on health and education and making the social welfare programs
better targeted are essential to reducing income inequality and making growth more inclusive.
25.
Staff urges the government to articulate a clearer set of measures to reduce the wage
bill relative to GDP and broaden the tax base. Despite the modest wage awards in recent years
and the de facto hiring freeze, the wage bill continues to be high reflecting the impact of
promotions, non-wage allowances and overtime. The authorities should avoid granting unwarranted
preferential tax regimes for businesses.
26.
Botswana’s exchange rate regime has served the country well. Staff encourages the
authorities to continuously look for opportunities to further strengthen the operational aspects of
the exchange rate framework and deepen the money and foreign currency markets.
27.
The continued increase in household borrowing warrants close monitoring. Staff urges
the authorities to use macro prudential tools to limit potential vulnerabilities in the financial system.
Plans to establish a national credit bureau is also welcomed. Policies to enhance financial inclusion
should focus on mitigating the underlying market failures in the financial system and reducing
intermediation costs.
28.
Returning to a period of strong growth would require policies to reinvigorate total
factor productivity. These include improving the quality of public spending, most notably on
education and the public investment program to ensure the transformation of diamond wealth into
sustainable assets, reducing further the regulatory burden on firms, alleviating infrastructure
bottlenecks and improving access to finance by small and medium sized enterprises.
29.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation with Botswana take place on
the standard 12-month cycle.

Authorities’ Response

Recommendations
Fiscal Policy

Policy

- consolidate fiscal policy and rebuild
the fiscal buffers.
- develop medium term expenditure
framework.

The FY2014/15 Budget targets a small fiscal
surplus, and is centered on further expenditure
restraint, which is consistent with staff advice.
The FY2014/15 budget for the first time
includes medium term projection of
government accounts—in line with staff advice.

- rationalize state owned enterprises
(SOE).
- contain the wage bill.

The FY 2014/15 budget puts a strong emphasis
on addressing the performance of SOEs and
reducing their reliance on budgetary resources.
The outsourcing of low-skilled government
services has not significantly reduced the wage
bill as some of the affected employees have
been redeployed to other government
departments. The measures taken thus far have
been partially consistent with staff advice.

- broaden the tax base.

One of the key objectives of the MTR of NDP
10 is to achieve a simplified tax system with
high compliance and a low cost of
administration. The measures taken thus far
have been partially consistent with staff advice.
The authorities continue to strengthen
NBFIRA’s skill base and regulatory
infrastructure with the assistance from the
AfDB. A significant progress has been made on
the retirement and Securities bills. The
government is conducting a diagnostic study of
the current Credit Reporting System in
Botswana to identify the gaps, and provide
recommendations on improving the current
credit reporting environment. The BoB has
subscribed a quarterly report on property
market that includes information on price
developments and is currently working towards
developing a property price index for
Botswana. The measures taken thus far have
been partially consistent with staff advice.

- strengthen the regulation and
supervision of nonbank financial
institutions.
- enhance the monitoring of
commercial banks’ exposure to
households and consider macro
prudential measures to limit the
growth rate of household borrowing
and the associated risks to financial
stability.
- establish a national credit bureau
- develop a reliable property market
index to help monitor price
developments and take appropriate
regulatory steps where needed.

Medium/
Low

Low
Botswana has not been significantly affected by the
recent capital outflows from emerging economies and
surges in global financial market volatility are not likely
to have a significant impact. Staff analysis shows that
once global shocks are controlled for, there is no
evidence of significant spillovers from South Africa on
Botswana and other SACU countries.
Medium to High
A protracted slowdown of Botswana’s major trading
partners could have a negative impact on Botswana’s
mineral exports and thus fiscal revenue.
Medium
Emerging market economies, such as India and China,
are becoming growing trading partners for Botswana.
A slowdown in emerging markets could lower
commodity prices with negative implications for the
balance of payments, fiscal revenue and growth of
Botswana.
Medium
While the recent decline in commodity prices may to
some extent rub off on diamond prices, the storable
nature of diamonds, that allows buffering of shocks by
adjusting inventories, will likely limit the price decline.
Indeed, since the 2008-09 global financial crisis,
Debswana has been keeping production volumes
stable while
using inventories in response to global demand
changes. Nevertheless, a protracted decline in the
global demand for diamonds could have negative
implications for growth and fiscal revenues.
Low
Key channels of impact could arise from Botswana’s
exchange rate link to the rand and from the close
financial linkages—of both banks and nonbanks.
However, staff analysis did not find any evidence of
significant spillovers from South Africa once global
shocks are controlled for. Plausible explanations
include: the limited
extent of integration, the difficulty to detect separately
South Africa’s growth impact from global growth after
South Africa reintegrated into the world economy with
the end of sanctions, and the possibility that the
multiple spillover channels pull in opposite directions.

The RAM shows events that could materially alter the baseline path—the scenario most likely to materialize in staff’s view. The relative
likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below
10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability of 30 percent or more). The RAM reflects staff views on
the source of risks and overall level of concern at the time of discussions with the authorities.

Domestic Risks
Medium to High
A delay in the full commencement of the
Morupule B power plant would weigh
heavily on the domestic economy going
forward, lowering electricity output and
extending to the general private sector that
bears the opportunity cost of power
shortages. In addition, import bills for
electricity and fuel will remain at record-high
levels.

Medium to High
A deterioration of the credit portfolio of
unsecured lending could undermine the
soundness of Botswana’s banking system
because the bulk of household credit—
which counts for more than 55 percent of
banks’ total loans—is unsecured loans. In
addition, this shock could easily propagate
through the nonbank sector given their
strong linkages.

Botswana returned to a current account surplus in 2013 for the first time after the
2008-09 financial crisis (Figure 1). The trade balance improved over the period 2012-2013, after
being in a deficit for six years in a row. During this time, SACU revenues partly contributed to the
financing of the trade deficit. The return to surplus in the current account balance in 2013 was
supported by a rebound in diamond exports. (Figures 2 and 3).

Botswana’s capital inflows have been relatively stable over the past three years, while
the level of international reserves remained adequate during this period. Net inflows under
foreign direct investment and portfolio investment remained stable both in absolute and in relative
to GDP terms. Their average value amounted to 2.1 and -1.2 percent of GDP in 2012 and 2013,
respectively, which is in line with their average pattern observed after 2009. Reserve coverage
remained at about 10 months of import coverage at end-2013.
4.
The Pula is broadly in line with fundamentals from a medium-term perspective
(Table 1). The exchange rate assessment is based on the macroeconomic balance (MB), the
external sustainability (ES), the purchasing power parity (PPP), and the equilibrium real exchange
rate (ERER) methodologies that are similar to those proposed by the IMF’s Consultative Group on

Prepared by Emmanouil Kitsios.

2.
While the trade balance improved, the deficit (excluding diamonds) widened
(Figure 3). The diamond industry contributed to the improvement of the trade balance, but imports
continued to grow. Diamond exports increased, partly reflecting the increased demand from
advanced economies that are showing the first signs of recovery from the financial crisis, such as the
United States. The significant import growth in 2013 worsened the deficit in the trade balance
excluding diamonds. The increase in import growth is partly due to increased electricity imports.

Non-price competitiveness indicators suggest that Botswana performs well relative to
its peers in macroeconomic related indicators, but important challenges remain in the
education and health related indicators
(Figure 4). Botswana performs better than other
middle-income countries in terms of strength of
institutions and financial market development. In
2013, Botswana significantly improved its
macroeconomic environment. However, there
was no progress in 2013 on the health and
education related indicators, on which Botswana
has been consistently lagging behind its peers,
as well as in innovation which has slightly

Overall, the analysis suggests a medium-term balance of payments position that is
broadly in line with macroeconomic fundamentals from a medium-term perspective. Staff’s
assessment, which incorporates features appropriate for natural resource–rich economies, show that
the current level of the real effective exchange rate (REER) is broadly in line with macroeconomic
fundamentals and that the balance of payments position is not likely to give rise to disruptive
exchange rate movements under the crawling peg arrangement. Botswana’s current account and
trade balance improved over the period 2012-13 and international reserves have remained at high
levels for the past few years. However, the improvements in Botswana’s external position relied
heavily on increases in diamond exports. Promoting export diversification would enhance
Botswana’s external stability, as well as broaden the base for achieving a sustainable long-term
growth.

Appendix II. Managing Inward Global Spillovers1
1.
Staff has assessed the impact of selected risks on Botswana by conducting G-RAM
consistent simulations using a structural model. Staff constructed a four region version of the
Global Integrated Monetary and Fiscal model (GIMF), tailored to Botswana’s specific economic
circumstances. The four regions are intended to capture Botswana, the United States, the Euro area,
and the rest of the world which also has emerging market economies including South Africa. Staff
simulated the following adverse scenarios:
2.
Scenario 1: Surges in global financial market volatility would negatively affect real
GDP growth in Botswana, but the impact would be short-lived (Figure 1). An increase in the US
interest rates would lead to a US dollar appreciation relative to the Pula. However, Botswana’s
effective exchange rate would appreciate, reflecting the depreciation tendencies of countries that
trade with Botswana and the fact that Botswana’s main exporting good (diamonds) is priced in US
dollars. The deterioration of the trade balance would lead to an initial mild decline in real GDP
growth and an eventual depreciation of the Pula.
3.
Scenario 2: A slowdown in the Euro-area would negatively affect Botswana in the
short-term (Figure 2). Botswana is potentially vulnerable to demand shocks in advanced
economies that could induce fluctuations in world demand for diamonds. Botswana’s effective
exchange rate would appreciate on impact, which, combined with the sluggish demand for
Botswana’s products in the Euro-area, would reduce exports. The impact on GDP would be less
pronounced. The policy rate would decline in response to Pula’s appreciation, and investment and
real GDP growth would rise in the second period.
4.
Scenario 3: A slowdown in emerging market economies would lead to a decline of
Botswana’s exports, but the effect on GDP growth would be moderate (Figure3). Real
investment would initially decline as a result of declining exports and reduced economic activity, but
then pick up as domestic interest rates would increase in response to the appreciation of the real
effective exchange rate. Real GDP growth would initially decline due to the drop in exports, but
eventually recover, largely reflecting the increase in real investment.
5.
Scenario 4: The re-emergence of financial stress in the euro area would negatively
affect real GDP growth in Botswana, but the impact would be short lived (Figure 4). Staff
simulated a temporary increase of 1 percentage point in Euro-area sovereign risk. Demand for
imports from Botswana would decline, but the effect would be short lived. Real investment would
initially decline, but then pick up as domestic interest rates would decline to counteract the
appreciation of the real effective exchange rate. Real GDP growth would eventually recover from the
decline induced by the drop in exports.
6.
A growth slowdown in South Africa would have limited potential spillovers to
Botswana, once the impact of global shocks are controlled for. A growth slowdown in South
Africa might be propagated to the rest of the region via FDI outflows from its neighboring countries,

such as Botswana. Additionally, a looser monetary policy in South Africa and the associated
depreciation of the rand may lower export prices and boost the competitiveness of Botswana on
international markets in the short term. While there are multiple linkages (trade, investment,
financial, and institutional) that are quantitatively important, recent empirical analysis have not been
able to detect a clear impact after 1994, once global shocks are controlled for.2 Plausible
explanations include: the limited extent of integration, the continent’s growth acceleration from the
mid-1990s, the fact that South Africa’s growth impact may have become impossible to detect
separately from global growth after South Africa reintegrated into the world economy with the end
of sanctions, and the possibility that the multiple spillover channels pull in opposite directions.
7.
The results from the structural modeling approach suggest that the potential
spillovers would be limited and transitory. The analysis revealed that Botswana is more
vulnerable to external shocks originating from advanced economies, rather than from emerging
markets, including South Africa. This finding is in agreement with recent empirical studies that show
a limited impact of real spillovers from economic developments in South Africa to the region, once
global economic shocks have been properly accounted for.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance with some data shortcomings in
national accounts, fiscal, monetary, and external sector statistics.
Macroeconomic data are adequate for surveillance, but some shortcomings exist in terms of
accuracy and reliability of the source data and the statistical techniques used in the compilation of
national accounts, government finance, and balance of payments statistics. The timeliness of the
central bank survey and detailed government expenditure data by economic classification needs to
be increased to better support economic analysis and prepare Botswana for an eventual
subscription to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS). Further improvements would
include dissemination of readily available information on monthly production of diamonds and
quarterly aggregate financial soundness indicators.
The authorities are working on a number of fronts to improve data quality and dissemination: (i)
source data and methodologies are being reviewed for those data with obvious estimation
problems/gaps, (ii) stronger collaboration is being sought among source data producers to secure
consistency and reconcile discrepancies across data sets; (iii) the production of leading economic
indicators is currently underway; and (iv) staff shortages are being addressed within budget
constraints.
National Accounts: In October 2012, the Statistics Botswana (SB) announced revised time series of
GDP rebased to 2006 as a new benchmark year. However, there are some weaknesses and areas
for further improvements, which include representativeness of the coverage of national accounts
surveys and estimations of the GDP deflators. The Labor Force Survey (2005/06) is out of date.
More frequent surveys would support a better understanding of poverty and unemployment.
Price Statistics: The official monthly consumer price index (CPI) is available on a timely basis in the
SB’s website. The index is comprehensive and provides breakdowns between urban and rural price
data, and between prices of tradable (domestic and imported) and nontradable goods and
services. Currently SB is working to update the CPI weights based on the recent Household Income
and Expenditure Survey. Compilation challenges include the eventual inclusion of owner-occupied
housing price data in the CPI. Compilation of producer or wholesale prices has been discontinued.
Government Finance Statistics: The concepts and definitions used in compiling government
finance statistics generally follow the guidelines of the IMF’s 1986 Government Finance Statistics
Manual (GFSM 1986) but cover only budgetary central government activities. No fiscal statistics are
compiled for extra budgetary institutions, consolidated central government, or consolidated
general government. No decision has been made by the authorities on adopting a “migration
path” to the GFSM 2001 methodology, although the authorities are working with the Fund
Statistics Department (STA) toward that endeavor. Recurrent and development expenditure data
are published with a significant lag. Development spending comprises a mixture of current and
capital spending.
Monetary and Financial Statistics: Compilation practices are consistent with the Fund’s Monetary
and Financial Statistics Manual. The central bank survey is currently available with a lag of usually
6

CORRECTED : 7/2/14
BOTSWANA

about three months, which is well short of the two-week period recommended in the SDDS. STA’s
recommendation is to make preliminary data available with clear identification of data status. The
authorities prefer a more cautious approach to data dissemination to avoid reputation damage if
the data require revisions. The BoB is seeking to expand the coverage of financial statistics to
include the operations of nonbank financial intermediaries (NBFI), such as pension funds, insurance
companies, and other financial corporations, such as unit trusts, finance companies, and financial
auxiliaries. STA’s recommendation is to focus on data collection in a handful of large institutions
within each NBFI category.
Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Statistics: Annual and quarterly
balance of payments data are published in the Botswana Financial Statistics (BF) and the BoB’s
Annual Report. Preliminary data are generally disseminated within two months of the end of the
reporting period, while revised (final) data are available after nine months. The concepts, structure,
and definitions of the balance of payments statistics follow the fifth edition of the Balance of
Payments Statistics Manual (BPM5). Source data are adequate, but the International Transaction
Reporting System (ITRS) data—as opposed to alternative survey data on services and transfer
items in the current account—has become unreliable. Data compilation, estimation, and
adjustments mostly employ sound techniques, but the methods used for estimating missing data
(for example, unrecorded trade), f.o.b. /c.i.f. adjustment factors to import values, and flows from
stock data are inadequate. Discrepancies exist in trade statistics data concerning: (i) the valuation
of diamond exports and (ii) imports, exports, and payments related to settlements within the
Southern African Customs Union (SACU). Following the relocation of De Beers’ London operations,
the BoB has introduced detailed new forms for import and export of diamonds to present the
rising re-exports trade for diamonds. Compilation challenges include appropriate treatment of
diamond related re-export trade both in the national accounts and balance of payments.
The BoB conducts an annual survey of Botswana’s investment and international investment
position (IIP). A quarterly IIP survey is also produced for internal use with data from the ITRS.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Botswana has participated in the GDDS since late 2002. A Data ROSC and its updates were
published in April 2002, March 2004, and April 2007, respectively.
III. Reporting to STA
Monetary data are reported for publication in International Financial Statistics using Standardized
Report Forms and Botswana reports annual balance of payments and IIP data to STA. No
government financial statistics are currently reported for publication in the Government Finance
Statistics Yearbook.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

June 17, 2014

Approved By

Prepared by African Department

Anne-Marie Gulde and
Mark Flanagan

MEDIUM-TERM PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
Botswana’s gross public debt was broadly unchanged in nominal pula terms but decreased
slightly relative to GDP in 2013/14 compared with 2012/13. However, there was a slight
change in the structure of the debt: the external debt decreased slightly, while domestic debt
increased offsetting the decline in the external debt. As a result, the share of external debt in
total debt decreased slightly to 67 percent in 2013/14.
Botswana’s historically low level of public debt reflects the authorities’ prudent macroeconomic
policies. This resulted in a significant reserve accumulation, which allowed them to face the
Great Recession with strong policy buffers. Therefore, countercyclical policies were
successfully implemented without much debt accumulation.
Staff’s analysis, based on the permanent income hypothesis, suggests that in order to fully
preserve mineral wealth for future generations, the non-mineral primary balance (NMPB)
should be reduced to about 5 percent of non-mineral GDP from the current level of about 14
percent. 1
The baseline scenario, underlying the staff’s macroeconomic framework, assumes continuing
fiscal consolidation with the primary surplus amounting about 2 percent of GDP on average for
2014/15–19/20. The main burden of fiscal adjustment falls on primary expenditure. By
2019/20, the stock of gross public debt is projected at 7 percent of GDP (Table 1).
Figure 1 shows two alternative scenarios:

The associated background work can be found in the 2012 Article IV staff report
(http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.aspx?sk=26166.0).

•
The first scenario aims to demonstrate what would be the fiscal outcome if the main
macro-variables are maintained at their historical 10-year averages. In this scenario, debt-toGDP ratio does not decline further and stabilizes at about 14 percent of GDP—much higher
than suggested by the baseline scenario. The main driver of this kind of dynamics is the
deteriorated primary balances due to countercyclical fiscal policy response to the 2008-09
financial crisis.
•
The second scenario assumes no change in the policy and holds the primary fiscal
balance constant at its 2014/15 level (1.4 percent of GDP) throughout the medium-term. In this
case, public debt also stabilizes at a level higher than suggested by the baseline scenario,
because the baseline scenario assumes further fiscal consolidation.

MEDIUM–TERM EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
Botswana’s gross external debt decreased to 26 percent of GDP in 2013 from 28.5 percent in 2012.
The government’s external borrowing was mainly from multilateral organizations, including from the
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the African Development Bank.
The stock of Botswana’s gross external debt is projected to decline gradually from about 26 percent
of GDP in 2013 to about 13.5 percent of GDP in 2019 (Table 2). Ongoing fiscal consolidation
supported by a steady improvement in international terms of trade, and stable FDI inflows should
support a reduction in the external debt ratio.
An alternative scenario, with key debt-creating variables at their historical levels, suggests that
Botswana could become a net creditor vis-à-vis the rest of the world over the medium-term. This is
a notable improvement over the baseline projections (Figure 2).
Simulations suggest that Botswana’s external debt-to-GDP ratio is sensitive only to a current
account shock. A real depreciation shock, while it increases the debt-to-GDP ratio initially, has only
a marginal impact on the medium-term debt dynamics. Moreover, Botswana’s external debt is not
very sensitive to a shock in interest rates and economic activity.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with Botswana
On July 3, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation 1 with Botswana and considered and endorsed the staff appraisal without
a meeting.2
Botswana’s economy grew faster than expected reaching a real Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
growth of about 6 percent in 2013, which reflects the cyclical recovery of the mining sector
along with the recovery in its major trading partners. However, the non-mineral sector slowed
down, partly reflecting recurring power supply disruptions. Consumer price inflation decelerated
significantly and stood at 4.4 percent at the end of March 2014—well within the Bank of
Botswana’s (BoB) medium-term objective range of 3–6 percent. The deceleration in inflation
largely reflects a base effect of fuel price increase in 2012 and the appreciation of the Pula
against the rand.
Preliminary data suggest that the fiscal balance registered a small surplus in FY 2013/14. This
outcome was supported by a further reining in current expenditure, higher mining revenue, and a
one-off increase in the Bank of Botswana’s (BoB) profit transfer. Botswana’s current account
recorded a surplus in 2013 compared to a deficit in 2012. The diamond sector contributed to the
improvement of the current account balance, but imports continued to grow. As a result, the
overall external position continues to be relatively strong with official reserve coverage standing
at about 10 months of import cover at end-March 2014. Despite the recent deceleration,
household borrowing grew at about 24 percent annually in January 2014, which was among the
highest in the region. Banks’ nonperforming loans (NPLs), while rising, still remain low by
international standards.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.
2

Article IV consultations are concluded without a Board meeting when the following conditions apply: (i) there are
no acute or significant risks, or general policy issues requiring Board discussion; (ii) policies or circumstances are
unlikely to have significant regional or global impact; (iii) in the event a parallel program review is being completed,
it is also being completed on a lapse-of-time basis; and (iv) the use of Fund resources is not under discussion or
anticipated.

2
Staff projects Botswana’s real GDP growth to slow down to 4.4 percent in 2014 and
subsequently stabilize at around 4 percent over the medium-term. The growth slowdown in 2014
is owing to the slowdown in diamond recovery and continued problems in the electricity and
water supply which has affected the non-mineral sector. Headline inflation is likely to remain
within the BoB’s medium-term objective range in 2014. The current account surplus is expected
to stabilize at around 2 percent of GDP over the medium-term supported by the planned fiscal
consolidation.
The main near-term risks relate to the uncertain external environment, such as the potential
slowdown in emerging markets, which poses downside risks to mineral export demand. On the
domestic front, the ongoing problems with power supply and continued high though decelerating
growth in household borrowing are potential sources of vulnerabilities. A key medium-term risk
relates to the sustainability of long-term growth as trend growth has softened in the last decade
requiring the easing of structural bottlenecks and finding new growth drivers.
Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the 2014 Article IV consultation with Botswana, Executive Directors endorsed
staff’s appraisal, as follows:
Botswana’s economic performance has been remarkable thanks to the authorities’ good
governance and prudent management of natural resources. However, in recent years, trend
growth has softened in the midst of high unemployment and income inequality.
The mid-term review (MTR) of the 10th National Development Plan (NDP10) serves as the
authorities’ blueprint for structural transformation. Staff welcomes the MTR of NDP 10, which
reemphasizes the need to reduce the size of government relative to GDP so that the private sector
can take the lead in generating economic growth.
Under current conditions the economy is broadly internally and externally balanced and the
authorities’ near-term macroeconomic policy stance is appropriate. Overall external stability is,
however, affected by the lack of export diversification, which leaves Botswana’s economy
vulnerable to fluctuations in the international demand for diamonds.
Staff welcomes the authorities’ medium-term fiscal strategy. The emphasis on rebuilding the
Pula Fund and improving the performance of state owned enterprises is well placed. Improving
the quality of spending on health and education and making the social welfare programs better
targeted are essential to reducing income inequality and making growth more inclusive.
Staff urges the government to articulate a clearer set of measures to reduce the wage bill relative
to GDP and broaden the tax base. Despite the modest wage awards in recent years and the de
facto hiring freeze, the wage bill continues to be high reflecting the impact of promotions, nonwage allowances and overtime. The authorities should avoid granting unwarranted preferential
tax regimes for businesses.
Botswana’s exchange rate regime has served the country well. Staff encourages the authorities to
continuously look for opportunities to further strengthen the operational aspects of the exchange
rate framework and deepen the money and foreign currency markets.

3
The continued increase in household borrowing warrants close monitoring. Staff urges the
authorities to use macro prudential tools to limit potential vulnerabilities in the financial system.
Plans to establish a national credit bureau is also welcomed. Policies to enhance financial
inclusion should focus on mitigating the underlying market failures in the financial system and
reducing intermediation costs.
Returning to a period of strong growth would require policies to reinvigorate total factor
productivity. These include improving the quality of public spending, most notably on education
and the public investment program to ensure the transformation of diamond wealth into
sustainable assets, reducing further the regulatory burden on firms, alleviating infrastructure
bottlenecks and improving access to finance by small and medium sized enterprises.
