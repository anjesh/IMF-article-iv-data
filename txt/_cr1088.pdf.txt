DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO
Staff Report for the 2009 Article IV Consultation, Request for a Three-Year Arrangement
Under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility, and Request for Additional Interim
Assistance Under the Enhanced Initiative for Heavily Indebted Poor Countries
Prepared by the African Department
(In consultation with other departments)
Approved by Mark Plant and Dominique Desruelle
November 30, 2009
Mission dates: March 16–31; April 22–28; August 10–18; and October 27–November 10, 2009.
Team: Messrs. Ames (head), Ben Ltaifa, and Farah, and Ms. Bovha-Padilla (all AFR) and
Messrs. Callegari (FAD), Hostland (SPR), and Jahjah (Resident Representative). The team
coordinated closely with the local World Bank office.
Context: Growth in 2008 was strong, but was weakened by the onset of the global financial
crisis during the second half of the year that resulted in a deterioration of the country’s terms
of trade and large job losses in the mining sector. The escalation of the conflict in the eastern
provinces, along with weaknesses in public financial management, resulted in large spending
overruns during the fourth quarter of 2008, which placed pressure on the exchange rate and
inflation through early 2009. The constitutionally mandated fiscal decentralization policy
created further challenges during the year given weak institutional capacity at both the
central and provincial levels. Macroeconomic policies for the rest of 2009 and 2010 aim at
reducing inflation while mitigating the impact of the global financial sector on the economy.
Article IV consultation: Discussions focused on policies and reforms that (i) foster
sustained and higher economic growth; (ii) enhance external sustainability; and
(iii) strengthen institutional capacity for economic management.
Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF): The authorities are requesting a new
three-year arrangement under the PRGF in an amount of SDR 346.45 million (65 percent of
quota) and additional interim assistance under the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries
(HIPC) Initiative.
IMF relations: The last Article IV consultation took place on September 5, 2007, and since
then staff have been monitoring the authorities’ economic program through a series of staff
monitored programs (SMPs). The previous PRGF arrangement (SDR 580 million;
109 percent of quota) was almost fully drawn (SDR 553.47 million) before it expired in
March 2006 without completing the sixth review owing to policy slippages in the lead-up to
the first democratic elections in four decades. The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)
reached the decision point of the enhanced HIPC Initiative in July 2003.
Exchange rate regime: The DRC’s exchange rate regime is classified as a free float. It has
accepted the obligations under Article VIII, section 2, 3, and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of
Agreement, but maintains an exchange restriction and a multiple currency practice.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Recent developments. A sharp decline in world commodity prices in late 2008 slowed economic
activity in 2009, while the escalation of conflict in the eastern provinces led to higher security
spending, increased government borrowing from the central bank, and an upsurge in inflation and
depreciation of the exchange rate during the first quarter of 2009. Lower government borrowing from
the central bank and tight monetary policy during the first half of 2009 helped reduce inflation and
stabilize the exchange rate. However, inflation increased and the exchange rate depreciated during
the third quarter of 2009 reflecting excess liquidity in the economy largely due to central bank
lending to distressed banks and failure to anticipate and mop up liquidity injections by the
government. The DRC’s debt situation remains unsustainable absent substantial debt relief.
Article IV Consultation. The discussions focused on fostering sustained and high economic growth,
enhancing external sustainability, and strengthening institutional capacity for economic management.
Key themes included:
•

Enhancing macroeconomic stability. Fiscal policy should be geared to avoiding
government recourse to central bank financing to alleviate the burden on monetary policy for
achieving the inflation objective. Central bank reorganization, restructuring and
recapitalization is key to enhancing its independence and capacity to conduct monetary
policy. The free floating exchange rate regime is appropriate given the economy’s
susceptibility to exogenous shocks.

•

Increasing fiscal space. The challenge is to mobilize domestic revenue and strengthen public
financial management (PFM) in support of priority expenditure, including reconstruction.
This requires bold reforms to modernize and consolidate tax administration, streamline
exemptions, and simplify the tax system. Strengthening PFM, including at the provincial
level given the decentralization policy, will also help improve expenditure allocation and
mobilize development aid.

•

Improving the business climate. The authorities need to press ahead with reforms to reduce
the cost of doing business, with emphasis on restructuring public enterprises that provide
growth critical services and on simplifying procedures for operating a business.

•

Strengthening institutional capacity. The authorities need to strengthen policy coordination
within government, including through the merging of the ministries in charge of finance and
budget. Improving socioeconomic statistics is also critical for monitoring and assessing the
effectiveness of policies and reforms.

New program. The authorities are requesting a three-year PRGF arrangement to support the
implementation of their poverty reduction and growth strategy (PRGS) and additional interim HIPC
assistance in the amount of SDR 45.66 million. The program aims to enhance macroeconomic
stability, create fiscal space for priority spending, and accelerate structural reforms.
Program risks. The economy is vulnerable to exogenous shocks and the lingering conflict. Weak
institutional capacity could also adversely affect program implementation. These risks could be
lowered by increased donor financial and technical assistance and by the ongoing peace efforts to
pacify the eastern provinces.

I. BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT
1.
Socioeconomic conditions in the DRC remain dire following a decade long conflict.
The human cost and destruction of the country’s social and economic infrastructure were
enormous. As a result, although rich in natural resources, the country’s per capita income and
human development indicators remain amongst the lowest in Africa (Figure 1).
2.
The return of peace to most of the country in 2003 paved the way for political and
economic stability. During 2003–06, the transitional government implemented prudent
macroeconomic polices, restored confidence, brought hyperinflation under control, and laid the
foundation for high levels of growth (Figure 2). This facilitated the installation of the new
democratically elected government in March 2006.
3.
The country’s dilapidated infrastructure constitutes one of the principal
impediments to economic growth, private sector development, and poverty reduction.
Given the huge infrastructure development needs and limited concessional resources available
from traditional development partners, the authorities are pursuing nontraditional modes of
financing to fill the gap, including resource-backed infrastructure development financing
(Box 1).
4.
The security situation in the eastern provinces remains fragile despite recent
peacekeeping efforts. Attacks by armed militants continue to destabilize the eastern provinces.
In 2008 and early 2009, this resulted in urgent spending requests outside the expenditure chain
that placed pressure on scarce budgetary resources. In March 2009, the government and key
rebel groups signed an agreement to integrate combatants into the national army. Disarmament
and reintegration remains a key challenge with important budgetary implications.
5.
The constitutionally mandated decentralization policy also poses significant
budgetary and implementation challenges. The authorities are committed to transferring
40 percent of government revenues to the provinces, along with the responsibility for
implementing social sector programs. Given existing constraints, however, they have decided to
slow down the pace of implementation while strengthening capacity in PFM and project
implementation at the provincial level.
6.
The onset of the global financial crisis has aggravated economic conditions. The
sudden and sharp drop in world commodity prices resulted in a marked deterioration in the
country’s terms of trade—in the context of its narrow commodity export base—and a decline in
foreign direct investment (FDI). This slowed economic activity, raised unemployment, and
amplified macroeconomic imbalances. It also weakened fiscal performance, on top of an already
low level of domestic revenue mobilization.
7.
The DRC is in debt distress. The stock of external debt is about US$13.1 billion with
debt service amounting to one-fourth of total expenditure. At end 2008, the present value of
public and publicly guaranteed external debt is estimated at 93 percent of GDP, 150 percent of
exports, and 502 percent of government revenue (excluding grants), well above the policy-based
threshold levels. 1 Given resource constraints, the country continues to accumulate arrears to

bilateral (including Paris Club) and commercial creditors, but remains current on obligations to
international financial institutions. The authorities continue to seek a settlement with the London
Club and other bilateral creditors on outstanding loans. The World Bank is financing, through its
Debt Reduction Facility, financial and legal technical assistance to the DRC to reach a settlement
with its London Club creditors.

To address these challenges, the authorities are requesting a new three-year PRGF
arrangement to support the implementation of their PRGS. The program aims to bolster
macroeconomic stability, strengthen PFM, reinforce central bank independence, and improve the
business climate. It is underpinned by an updated PRGS (2009–10) that bridges the period the
authorities need to finalize their second generation PRGS (2011–16) by June 2010.

Box 1. Democratic Republic of the Congo: The Sino-Congolese Cooperation Agreement (SCCA)
In April 2008, the DRC signed a cooperation agreement with a consortium of Chinese enterprises
involving a US$3.2 billion mining project and a set of US$6 billion public infrastructure projects to be
implemented in two phases. The Agreement was amended in October 2009 to exclude the second
phase public infrastructure projects, leaving just a single phase totaling US$3 billion to be
implemented over the period 2009–14. The amended agreement also limited the government guarantee
to the financing of the infrastructure projects.
The Agreement calls for the creation of a joint venture (SICOMINES) between a Congolese parastatal
mining enterprise (GECAMINES) and the consortium of Chinese enterprises. Paid-in capital of
US$100 million gave GECAMINES a 32 percent equity share in the joint venture. SICOMINE will
invest US$3.2 billion in the mining project financed by a US$1.1 billion interest-free loan and a
US$2.1 billion loan with a fixed interest rate of 6.1 percent. The US$3 billion investment in public
infrastructure is to be financed through a series of loans at a fixed interest rate of 4.4 percent. All loans
are denominated in US dollars.
Operating profits from the mining project will be used to repay the mining and public infrastructure
financing. The mine is expected to generate operating profits beginning in 2013. Initially, the net
profits of SICOMINES will repay principal and capitalized interest on four priority public
infrastructure projects (US$375 million). After this financing is fully repaid, 85 percent of the net
operating profits will be used to repay the principal and capitalized interest on the mining loan. After
the mining financing has been fully repaid, 85 percent of SICOMINES’ net operating profits will be
used to repay the principal and capitalized interest on the remaining public infrastructure loans and the
balance will be distributed as a dividend to the SICOMINES shareholders.
The grant element of the infrastructure financing is estimated at 42–46 percent, depending whether the
US$250 million signing bonus is taken into account. This is based on the following assumptions:
(i) the mining project does not generate any net income and the government guarantee is invoked after
25 years as provided for under the amended Agreement; (ii) accrued interest is compounded; and (iii) a
fixed interest rate of 4.4 percent applies.

11
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
9.
Macroeconomic policies were satisfactory during the first half of 2008. The fiscal
balance (cash basis) recorded modest surpluses through end-June. 2 Domestic revenue
performance was robust and expenditures were kept in line with available resources. This
allowed the central bank to contain the growth of monetary aggregates while keeping its policy
rate unchanged at 28 percent.
10.
The escalation of conflict weakened the fiscal position during the second half of
2008. An acceleration of security-related spending together with weak PFM shifted the
underlying fiscal balance to a deficit in the last quarter and limited the surplus for the year as a
whole to about 1 percent of GDP—about 1 percentage point below target (Figure 3). Under these
circumstances, net credit to government (NCG) by the Central Bank of the Congo (BCC) was
2 percentage points of GDP above target at year-end. This boosted base money and eased
liquidity conditions.
11.

Macroeconomic policies were mixed through September 2009.
• During the first half of the year, underlying fiscal surpluses (on a cash basis) averaged
0.1 percent of GDP, as the government slowed spending. During the third quarter, modest
improvements in domestic revenue (excluding the SCCA signing bonus) combined with
the government’s success in containing expenditures kept the fiscal position in line with
projections.
• On monetary policy, the BCC raised its indicative interest rate in two steps from
40 percent to 65 percent in January and stepped up sales of central bank bills. However,
increased lending by the BCC to distressed banks and the failure to mop up liquidity
injections by government led to periodic accelerations of base money growth during the
third quarter. In response, in October the BCC raised its indicative interest rate further to
70 percent, increased the reserve requirement ratio from 5 to 7 percent, and stepped up
sales of central bank bills.

2

The underlying fiscal balance is defined as revenue minus expenditure excluding interest on foreign debt, foreignfinanced investment, and exceptional outlays.

Against this background, macroeconomic outcomes were mixed.

12.

• Economic activity. In 2008, real GDP growth was about 6 percent instead of the
projected 10 percent reflecting weaker exports in the face of the global financial crisis
and supply bottlenecks (especially shortages in cement and electricity) that constrained
construction and manufacturing activities (Table 1). It is projected to be 2.7 percent in
2009 owing to the effects of the global financial crisis.
• Prices. There had been setbacks in containing inflation. After easing during the second
half of 2008 thanks to the retrenchment of world fuel and food prices, inflation picked up
in late 2008 and early 2009 owing mainly to government borrowing from the BCC. After
a brief decline in May-August, inflation started to rise and reached 53 percent (year-onyear) at end-October in response to the periodic strong increases in base money and the
depreciation of the Congolese franc. Under these circumstances, dollarization increased.
•

Current account and exchange rate. In 2008, the external current account deficit
(including transfers) widened by some 14½ percentage points of GDP to about 16 percent
of GDP owing to buoyant imports and the drop of export prices in second half of the year
on account of the global financial crisis. The Congolese franc depreciated by 35 percent
against the U.S. dollar between December 2008 and September 2009. The real exchange
rate remained broadly stable over the past several years.

• Gross official reserves. Reserves declined from US$180 million at end-2007 to about
US$78 million (one week of nonaid imports) by end-2008 and further to a historically
low level of US$30 million in February 2009. They reached US$894 million at
end-September (10 weeks of nonaid import cover) following the disbursement of
emergency assistance from the Fund and other development partners, the arrival of the
first tranche of the SCCA signing bonus, and the general and special SDR allocations
(SDR 424.5 million).
13.
Banking system soundness and vulnerability. The health of the financial sector
remains fragile (Text Table 1). At end September 2009, the capital-risk-weighted adequacy ratio
averaged about 15 percent (compared with the required 10 percent), up from about 11 percent at
the end of 2008. A large number of banks also have been unable to observe the required liquidity
and net foreign exchange position ratios. Nonperforming loans increased significantly at the end
of September 2009, reflecting in part recent improvements in the accuracy of the reporting
system. The contagion effects of the global financial crisis have thus far had a limited direct
impact on the banking system. Nevertheless, three local banks have shown signs of distress and
urgently need to be recapitalized. The BCC is implementing a comprehensive strategy to address
the issue, with technical assistance from the Fund and the World Bank. Specifically, it is
strengthening on-site and off-site banking supervision and tightening and enforcing prudential
regulations. It has also taken initial steps regarding the restructuring of one large bank.

14.
Performance under the program to date was satisfactory. All prior actions and
indicative targets through end-September were observed and structural reforms remained on
track (MEFP, Tables 1 and 2).
III. MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK
15.
Although short-term economic conditions remain weak, the medium-term outlook is
positive. The deterioration in the country’s terms of trade and the decline in FDI on account of
the global financial crisis are taking their toll on economic growth in 2009, particularly in the
mining sector. Growth should pick up in 2010 and average 6.5 percent in 2010–12, supported by
higher public and private investment and a recovery in the mining sector. However, it will
remain below the 8 percent projected during the previous Article IV consultation (IMF Country
Report No. 07/327). Inflation should decline to 48.7 percent by end-2009 and to single digits by
2012, supported by prudent fiscal and monetary policies. Given an expected gradual recovery in
exports and large increases in investment-related imports, the current account deficit is expected
to widen over the medium term, but will be financed in large part by capital and financial flows
tied to infrastructure and mining projects. Gross reserves will remain to the equivalent of about
10 weeks of imports in 2012, in large part supported by the government’s decision to save the
SDR allocations and maintain them in SDRs.

15
IV. ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION AND POLICY DISCUSSIONS
16.
Drawing on the recommendations from the 2007 Article IV consultation (Box 2), the
2009 Article IV consultation discussions centered on three main themes: (i) fostering
sustained and high economic growth; (ii) enhancing external sustainability; and
(iii) strengthening institutional capacity for economic management.

Box 2:

Democratic Republic of the Congo: Main Recommendations of the 2007 Article IV Consultations

Improve revenue collection, including through a
comprehensive reform of collection agencies.

While progress was made in improving revenue
collection, there have been delays in reforming the
collection agencies, increasing mining sector taxation,
and simplifying taxes.

Improve PFM and prioritization of spending.

There was progress in addressing the urgent spending
procedures, but comprehensive PFM reform remains
at infancy stage and the lingering conflict undermines
spending prioritization.

Reform the financial sector.

Some progress has been made in strengthening
banking supervision and reinforcing compliance with
prudential regulations, but efforts to restructure weak
banks has been slow.

Address fiscal dominance and enhance central bank
independence.

Reducing fiscal dominance has been hampered by
periods of increased government borrowing from the
central bank partly related to the lingering conflict in
the eastern provinces; restructuring of the central bank
is proceeding.

Implement structural reforms to enhance the
economy’s supply response.

Initial steps were taken to prepare key public
enterprises for privatization, but reforms to streamline
the regulatory environment and address governance
problems have been slow.

A. Fostering Sustained and High Economic Growth
17.
Sustained and high economic growth is critical to increasing per capita income and
reducing poverty. The authorities agreed with staff that this requires bolstering macroeconomic
stability, creating fiscal space for the provision of critical public goods, and advancing structural
reforms to foster private sector development.
18.
Moving toward macroeconomic stability. Given the country’s history of hyperinflation
and uneven implementation of policies, staff believe that the fiscal policy rule of zero net bank
credit to the government is critical to taming inflation and addressing fiscal dominance over
monetary policy. The central bank would need to remain vigilant and mop up any excess
liquidity, particularly those related to donor-financed public spending. The authorities agreed on
the need to avoid recourse to central bank borrowing as this would reduce the burden on
monetary policy in an environment where its effectiveness is already limited by the high degree
of dollarization and underdeveloped financial markets. The authorities and staff also concurred
that the reorganizing, restructuring, and recapitalizing the central bank is critical to enhancing its
independence and capacity to conduct monetary and exchange rate policy.

16
19.
Increasing fiscal space for priority spending. To create such space, the authorities need
to mobilize domestic revenues and strengthen PFM. Staff noted the low levels of tax collection
to date, particularly in the mineral sector, and the importance of increasing domestic revenues to
address the country’s large reconstruction needs. The authorities agreed that bold reforms are
needed to modernize and consolidate tax and customs management, streamline exemptions, and
simplify the tax system, including introducing a VAT. They maintained, however, that this
would need to be addressed over the medium term given capacity constraints. However, they
have already begun taking steps to strengthen mining sector tax collection, including by
reviewing exemptions and establishing a unit within the tax administration dedicated to this
sector.
20.
PFM. Poor budget planning, circumvention of budgetary procedures, and ineffective
budget controls have weakened fiscal discipline and accountability. This, together with high
levels of nondiscretionary spending, impedes progress in achieving the country’s poverty
reduction objectives. Staff stressed the importance of realistic budgets, following proper
budgetary procedures, strengthening controls, and improving priority expenditure tracking.
Strengthening institutional capacity in PFM at the provincial level, with technical assistance
from development partners, will also be important given the ongoing decentralization. The
authorities concurred with the staff’s assessment and noted that progress on these fronts would
also help allay concerns over governance. They stressed that the speed of PFM reforms should
take into account the country’s post-conflict situation.
21.
Improving the business climate. Staff urged the authorities to press ahead with reforms
to reduce the cost of doing business and to diversify the economy. The authorities indicated that
they are placing emphasis on restructuring public enterprises and privatizing the management of
key public services (i.e., transport and utilities) as a first step toward privatization. They plan to
submit to parliament a law that will allow the DRC to participate in the Organization for the
Harmonization of Business Law in Africa (OHADA), which will help simplify procedures for
business registration and strengthen legal protection of foreign investment. The authorities also
noted that they established and staffed the office responsible for the implementation of the 2004
anti-money laundering and combating financing of terrorism legislation. Staff welcomed these
efforts, but encouraged the authorities to advance reforms in the areas of banking supervision,
credit information management, and the judiciary.
B. Enhancing External Sustainability
22. A flexible exchange rate regime is appropriate given the country’s low level of
foreign reserves and vulnerability to exogenous shocks (Box 3). Staff noted that the
exchange rate has broadly tracked economic fundamentals and appears appropriate assuming
that donor flows continue and the DRC benefits from debt relief under the enhanced HIPC
Initiative and Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI). The authorities concurred, noting that
the central bank intervenes in the foreign exchange market to achieve its reserve target and to
smooth sharp fluctuations in the rate. Staff stressed that this could best be addressed by
advancing reforms to reduce the cost of doing business.

17
Box 3. The Democratic Republic of the Congo: An Assessment of the Exchange Rate Policy and External
Competitiveness
The exchange rate of the Congo franc has been freely floating since the liberalization of the foreign exchange
market and the unification of the exchange rate in 2001. Since then, BCC intervention in the foreign exchange
market has been limited. Thus, the exchange rate appears to have been responsive to changes in macroeconomic
policies and exogenous shocks. The nominal effective exchange rate of the Congo franc (NEER) depreciated by
10 percent a year on average over 2002–08 while the real effective exchange rate (REER) appreciated by 2 percent
on average over the same period. Although assessing the equilibrium exchange rate is a complicated exercise,
particularly in a post-conflict country with poor data and significant structural breaks, two approaches were used to
assess the consistency of the real exchange rate with its equilibrium level.
1. An estimation of the long-run trend of the real exchange rate by using standard smoothing filters—Fiveyear moving average of the REER and the Hodrik Prescott (HP) filter—to isolate the permanent component
from the transient and short term shocks. The smoothed variable is then interpreted as the equilibrium real
exchange rate. In 2002–08, the actual REER was below its equilibrium level most of the period, but appears to
have converged to its equilibrium level at the end of the period.

2. An application of the macro-balance approach developed by the Consultative Group on Exchange Rate
Issues. It consists of three steps. First, estimating an underlying current account (UCA) based on the medium
term framework, excluding temporary factors. Second, computing a current account norm (CAN) based on the
fundamentals. Third, deriving the adjustment in the REER necessary to close the gap between UCA and CAN,
assuming import and export elasticities. Using different approaches, the UCA is estimated at a deficit of
around 12 percent of GDP. The CAN is derived from variables and estimated coefficients on a panel of
developing countries (see Isard and others (IMF Occasional Paper, 2001). Essentially driven by low level of
net foreign assets and foreign aid, the CAN is estimated at about -8.4 percent. Using standard export and
import elasticities, the analysis suggests the exchange rate would need to depreciate by about 9 percent to close
the gap between the UCA and the CAN.
The above results do not suggest significant over or under valuation of the exchange rate. However, the inability by
the DRC to fully service its debt (and thus accumulate arrears on its external debt) suggests that macroeconomic
policies and structural reforms were insufficient to generate the growth and resources needed to fully meet debt
service obligations. Nevertheless, the exchange rate level would be appropriate if foreign aid flows continue and
the DRC benefits from debt relief from the enhanced HIPC initiative and the MDRI.

18
23. The DRC’s debt situation is unsustainable absent substantial debt relief. Debt
burden indicators markedly exceed their policy-based thresholds. 3 In the absence of debt relief
from the enhanced HIPC Initiative and the MDRI, external debt burden indicators are projected
to remain above policy-dependent thresholds over prolonged periods. The DRC will continue to
be vulnerable to adverse exogenous shocks even after access to debt relief under the enhanced
HIPC Initiative and MDRI reduces the country’s debt burden indicators below the thresholds. It
is expected to reach the HIPC Completion point at earliest during the second quarter of 2010,
assuming completion of the first review of the PRGF arrangement, indications that program
implementation through end-March 2010 remains satisfactory, one-year satisfactory
implementation of their PRGS, and observance of the HIPC triggers (Table 7). The authorities
committed to adhere to a debt strategy that minimizes the risks of debt stress by relying strictly
on grants or highly concessional loans. In this context, they have agreed with their partners to
remove from the SCCA the second phase infrastructure projects and the government guarantee
on the mining project.
C. Strengthening Institutional Capacity for Economic Management
24. Fragmented institutions and political considerations have complicated policy
management. The bifurcation of the ministries in charge of finance and budget impedes
efficiency and coordination of fiscal policy. This, along with weak monetary policy
coordination and fragmentation of responsibilities across other ministries, complicates policy
implementation and reform. These weaknesses would likely be exacerbated by the
constitutionally mandated fiscal decentralization policy given weak PFM at the provincial level.
Staff encouraged the authorities to merge the ministries in charge of finance and budget,
improve fiscal and monetary policy coordination, and strengthen the institutional capacities of
provinces. The authorities agreed, but stressed that this should be seen in the context of the
country’s nascent institutions and broad-based government coalition that has played a critical
role in national reconciliation.
25. Improvement in economic statistics is critical for program implementation and
monitoring. Weaknesses in data preparation, timeliness, and quality persist on account of
inadequate human and material resources and weak coordination. Staff urged the authorities to
adopt a new statistics law, finalize their national strategy for statistics development, and
complete the new national accounts. The authorities indicated that they would do so, but
stressed that rebuilding capacity in post-conflict setting would require substantial donor
assistance.
V. THE PROGRAM FOR 2009–12
26.
The authorities are requesting a three-year PRGF arrangement and disbursement
of additional interim assistance under the enhanced HIPC Initiative to support their
economic program over the period July 2009 to June 2012. The program’s objectives are:
(i) average real GDP growth of 5.5 percent; (ii) end-period inflation rate of 9 percent by 2012;
3

See the joint Bank/Fund Debt Sustainability Analysis.

19
(iii) gross reserves equivalent to 10 weeks of nonaid imports by 2012; and (iv) the external
current account deficit (including grants) limited to an average of 25 percent of GDP. The
program supports the implementation of the authorities’ PRGS (Box 4) and underpinning
policies and reforms, which are presented in the attached Letter of Intent (LOI), Memorandum of
Economic and Financial Polices (MEFP), and Technical Memorandum of Understanding
(TMU). The program focuses on enhancing macroeconomic stability, mobilizing domestic
revenues, strengthening PFM, reforming the central bank, and improving the business climate.

Box 4. The Democratic Republic of the Congo: Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy (PRGS)
The authorities completed their first full PRGS paper covering the period 2006–08 through a participatory process in
July 2006. It was endorsed by the democratically elected government in March 2007. The strategy is based on five
pillars:
•

Promotion of peace and good governance;

•

Consolidation of macroeconomic stability and promotion of economic growth;

•

Improvement in access to social services;

•

Fight against HIV/AIDS; and

•

Promotion of a dynamic community

In their PRSP Progress Report dated July 2008, the authorities acknowledged that the strategy was overly ambitious
and its implementation hindered by the conflict in the eastern provinces, capacity constraints, and budgetary
constraints. As a result, there was little progress in achieving the PRGS objectives and key social indicators did not
improve significantly, with the exception of primary education enrollment and maternal mortality rates. Delays in
rebuilding the democratic institutions also affected the government’s ability monitor key reforms.
With a view to ensuring the achievement of the PRGS objectives despite the problems experienced to date, the
authorities decided to extend their strategy for an additional 18 months through the end of 2010. They have adopted
an updated Priority Action Plan (PAP2) for the period 2009–10 that seeks to correct the weaknesses identified in the
progress report by prioritizing the key policies and actions to be implemented. Aligning the budget with these
priorities will be a key element of the government’s strategy going forward. Given that the poverty dynamics in the
DRC remain unchanged, staff believes that the current PRGS remains as the appropriate basis for underpinning the
PRGF in 2009 and 2010.
In parallel, the authorities are preparing their second generation PRGS, which will cover the period 2011–15. This
document will be developed in a participatory manner, including at the provincial level, and is expected to be
completed and approved by December 2010.

A. Macroeconomic Policies
27.
Macroeconomic policies aim at reducing inflation and supporting strong and
sustained economic growth. Fiscal policy will avoid recourse to central bank financing and lay
the foundation for long-term sustainability. Absent fiscal dominance, monetary policy will focus
on reducing inflation to single digits in the context of a flexible exchange rate regime.
Fiscal policy
28.
The budget deficits will be capped by the availability of concessional foreign
assistance. In this context, the underlying fiscal balance (cash basis) is targeted to shift from a
deficit of 2.1 percent of GDP in 2009 to 0.4 percent in 2012 (Table 2). This fiscal adjustment is
consistent with the government’s objectives of zero net borrowing from the banking sector and,

20
thus, reducing fiscal dominance over monetary policy. 4 Under the assumption that the DRC
receives substantial debt relief under the enhanced HIPC Initiative and MDRI, the program’s
medium-term fiscal adjustment is consistent with fiscal sustainability over the long term. 5
Domestic revenue (excluding the signing bonus from the SCCA) is projected to increase from
15.7 percent of GDP to about 20 percent over the same period. The projections are reasonable
given DRC’s post-conflict situation whereby economic recovery, expansion of central
government’s authority over the eastern provinces, the teething of tax and customs
administration reforms, and the introduction of a VAT are expected to improve revenue
collection. 6 This, along with scaled up development assistance, should allow higher domestic
spending on priority programs. The government is committed to reduce nonpriority spending
(including investment and transfers) in the event that domestic revenue or external budget
support are lower than envisaged. Further, the fiscal program provides for a budget reserve for
unanticipated events, such as natural disasters and security-related spending. The staff will
continue to work closely with the authorities to improve reporting on budget execution, including
information on social and other priority spending.
29.
The resolution of the conflict in the eastern provinces and the improved relationship
between the DRC and its neighbors will reduce security-related spending. In recent years,
security-related spending constrained other priority spending and complicated budget planning.
Over the medium term, improved security conditions will help enhance expenditure allocation,
reduce recourse to urgent spending procedures, and make budget planning more predictable This
should facilitate the implementation of the second generation PRGS.
Monetary and exchange rate policies
30.
The objective of monetary policy is to achieve single-digit inflation by 2012. Progress
on this front is critical to fostering confidence in the local currency. Base money will remain as
the nominal anchor. Pending the development of a treasury bill market, the BCC will primarily
use central bank bills to mop up excess liquidity (MEFP ¶21). As necessary, it will auction
foreign exchange to sterilize liquidity arising from donor-financed government spending. The
BCC will improve its liquidity forecasting in close collaboration with the Treasury.
31.
The BCC will rebuild its gross official foreign reserves. The program objective is to
maintain gross official reserves at the equivalent of 10 weeks of import coverage by 2012. This
level corresponds to slightly below one standard deviation of export levels and should therefore
be adequate, particularly given the country’s free-floating exchange rate regime. The BCC will
intervene in the foreign exchange market only to smooth large fluctuations in the rate and to
achieve the foreign reserve target (MEFP ¶21). 7 To support reserve build up while fostering
financial market development, the authorities are ceasing making payments in foreign exchange
to domestic suppliers and requiring tax payments to be made in local currency.
4

The zero net credit to government target for the year as whole is consistent with net borrowing within the year for
treasury management purposes. The ceiling will limit undue exposure to domestic debt and the crowding out of
private sector credit.

5

The program also includes a zero ceiling on nonconcessional external borrowing.

6

In 2002–08, the revenue-GDP ratio increased on average by some 2 percentage points notwithstanding the effects
of the lingering conflict in the eastern provinces and slow implementation of reforms.

7

The central bank may also intervene to avoid market disruptions due to the small size of the market.

21
B. Structural Reforms
32.
The authorities’ structural reform agenda will focus on domestic revenue
mobilization, PFM, central bank reform, and private sector development. The proposed
reforms are drawn from those outlined in the PRGS. Given the complementarity of reforms in
achieving the authorities’ objectives, the PRGF-supported program will be coordinated closely
with other development partners (Text Table 2).
33.
Domestic revenue mobilization. The focus is on expanding the tax base by streamlining
tax exemptions in the investment, mining, and forestry codes with a view to eliminating them
over time. Strengthening the Large Taxpayers Unit at the income tax department will improve
tax collection from mining companies (MEFP ¶26), while the introduction of a VAT in 2012 will
allow for the removal of various discretionary taxes (MEFP ¶23). To prepare for this, the
authorities plan to establish tax collection centers for medium-sized enterprises across the
country. Customs administration reform aims at reducing fraud, shortening clearance delays, and
improving valuation (MEFP ¶24). The customs administration will be transformed into a
department of the Ministry of Finance with its own budget. Key priorities will include improving
the monitoring of mining exports, expanding one-stop customs windows at border posts,
modernizing information management, enforcing pre-inspection regulations and enhancing
antifraud activities, and implementing a single taxpayer identification number.
34. PFM. The focus is on strengthening budget preparation, execution, and accountability
(MEFP ¶27). The authorities will adopt an organic public finance law aimed at rationalizing
and harmonizing the budget process. Budget planning and control will be strengthened by
developing a medium-term expenditure framework in cooperation with line ministries and by
requiring all government transactions to adhere to proper budget procedures. Other key reforms
include the introduction of a double entry accounting system at the treasury, enhancement of ex
ante and ex post budget controls, and preparation and implementation of an action plan to
strengthen PFM at the provincial level.
35. Central Bank reform. The focus is on restoring the BCC’s independence (MEFP ¶30)
and strengthening its supervisory capacity (MEFP ¶31) with the technical assistance from the
IMF’s Monetary and Capital Markets (MCM) department. Given the BCC’s limited income
base—low seignorage (due to dollarization), and interest earnings on foreign reserves (due to
low level of interest-bearing reserves), restructuring and reorganization are critical to make the
bank more efficient. This in turn will facilitate its recapitalization by the government.
Strengthening banking supervision will involve improving the legal and regulatory framework,
and reinforcing banking supervision capacity, including human and material resource
requirements.
36. Private sector development. Key elements include reforming public enterprises
(MEFP ¶37), streamlining government regulations and protecting foreign investment
(MEFP ¶33), and improving transparency in natural resource management by adhering to the
EITI (MEFP ¶36).

VI. THE 2009 AND 2010 PROGRAM
37.
The program objectives for 2009 are: (i) real GDP growth of 2.7 percent; (ii) an end-ofperiod inflation rate of 48.7 percent; and (iii) gross official reserves equivalent to 10 weeks of
nonaid imports.
Macroeconomic policies
38.
The fiscal program targets a reduction in government borrowing from the banking
sector. The underlying fiscal deficit (cash basis) is therefore targeted at 2.1 percent of GDP, a
deterioration of about 3 percentage points of GDP relative to 2008. This will allow a reduction in
net credit to government of about 1.2 percent of GDP, reflecting the savings of a large portion of
the signing bonus of the SCCA. To reach the deficit target, domestic revenues (excluding the
signing bonus) are projected at 15.7 percent of GDP (about 3 percentage points less than in
2008), reflecting mainly the impact of lower petroleum prices and weak economic activity.
Further, domestically financed spending (outside exceptional outlays) is targeted at 16.3 percent
of GDP.
39.
The fiscal objectives for the remainder of 2009 appear to be achievable. Domestic
revenue is expected to be line with program objectives for the year as a whole. On the
expenditure side, the authorities have taken corrective measures to address a large build up of
expenditure commitments in October that could have threatened the fiscal targets. Specifically,
they cancelled all commitments for which goods and services have not yet been delivered

23
(CF 68 billion) and delayed the repayment of arrears from 2007 and 2008 pending the outcome
of an ongoing audit (CF 31 billion). They also ceased all new expenditure commitments as of
end-October in line with budget procedures and reallocated credits for discretionary spending to
offset higher priority spending (i.e., goods and services and domestically financed investment).
These measures should keep the underlying fiscal deficit in line with the program objective.
40.
In 2010, fiscal policy will further enhance macroeconomic stability. Staff reached
understandings on a 2010 fiscal framework, which is consistent with draft budget submitted by
government to parliament. The underlying fiscal deficit (cash basis) is projected to decline to
0.5 percent of GDP in 2010. Higher domestically financed expenditure outside exceptional
spending (18 percent of GDP or about 2 percentage points more than in 2009) will be
accommodated by an increase in domestic revenues. Foreign-financed capital expenditure,
which includes the infrastructures projects implemented under the SCCA, is projected to
reach 14 percent of GDP. The resulting overall fiscal deficit on a cash basis (12.7 percent of
GDP) will be entirely financed through external budget and project support, with no recourse to
domestic financing. In this regard, the authorities have committed to reduce spending—mainly in
the areas of goods and services and domestically financed investment in non-priority programs—
in the event that domestic revenue or external budget support is lower than programmed.
41.
Monetary policy for the remainder of 2009 and in 2010 aims to reduce further endyear inflation to 48.7 percent and 15 percent, respectively. The BCC intends to maintain a
tight monetary policy stance to achieve its inflations objectives. In this context, base money
growth is targeted at 19.6 percent and 22 percent in 2009 and 2010, respectively, in line with
nominal GDP growth and the inflation objectives (Table 3). In addition to the use of central bank
bills to achieve the monetary targets, the BCC may auction foreign exchange while achieving its
gross reserves target. The central bank will maintain its current policy rate to support
disinflation.
42.
The program is fully financed. After taking into account debt relief under the enhanced
HIPC Initiative and MDRI, the remaining balance of payments financing gap for
July 2009-June 2010 is estimated at about US$154 million. This is expected to be covered by the
first and second disbursements under the PRGF. The financing gap for the period
July-December 2010 is estimated at US$355 million and is expected to be covered by budget
support from the World Bank (US$100 million), the European Commission (US$66 million),
and bilateral development partners (US$189 million). In the event of a shortfall in external
budget support, the disbursement of the second tranche of the SCCA signing bonus
(US$125 million), which is expected in December 2009, could be used.
Structural reforms
43.
Structural reforms in 2009 and 2010 will focus on the areas of tax and customs
administration, PFM, and the financial sector (MEFP ¶42).

24
44.
Fiscal structural reforms aim at strengthening tax administration and PFM. The
focus is to establish new tax centers for medium-sized enterprises in key provinces while
strengthening the existing ones. Customs administration will also be improved by computerizing
border posts and increasing the diffusion of one-stop windows. The simplification and
rationalization of revenue collection will be accompanied by the assessment and elimination of
nuisance taxes. On PFM, key reforms include bolstering budget planning and execution by, inter
alia, adopting an organic budget law, eliminating extra budgetary spending, enhancing the PFM
capacities of local governments, and improving the reliability of fiscal reporting.
45.
Financial sector reforms would focus on strengthening the role and independence of
the central bank. The BCC will first implement a new reorganization and restructuring plan that
will help put the bank’s financial situation on sustainable financial footing. The government will
in turn adopt a recapitalization plan for the BCC to restore its independence. With regard to
banking supervision, the focus will be on completing financial audits of the commercial banks
and developing restructuring plans for those that are financially weak. The BCC is tightening
prudential ratios and their monitoring, in line with recommendation by IMF technical assistance.
Further, the authorities have initiated the implementation of the 2004 anti-money laundering and
combating financing terrorism legislation.
VII. ACCESS AND PROGRAM MONITORING
46.
Access under the proposed program is consistent with the country’s balance of
payments needs. The proposed access of 65 percent of quota (SDR 346.45 million) takes into
account the strength of the program, projected donor contributions, and the high level of external
debt. The level of access is relatively modest in light of the severe debt situation and the
substantial risks to the program. Fund financial support would represent 38 percent of the
balance of payments need over 2010–12 (Tables 4 and 5). Disbursements will be conditioned on
the completion of semiannual reviews. Access levels can be revisited and augmented if need be
after the Completion point and/or in the event of a subsequent exogenous shock. The authorities
are also requesting additional interim assistance under the enhanced HIPC initiative in the
amount of SDR 45.66 million (20 percent of the total HIPC commitment) to help cover
51.1 percent of the principal repayments falling due to the IMF during the twelve-month period
from December 2009. 8
47.
The program will be monitored based on a set of quantitative semiannual
performance criteria and quarterly indicators, while structural reforms will be assessed in
the context of semiannual reviews. The proposed program would begin on July 1, 2009. The
quantitative performance criteria and indicators include ceilings on: (i) net credit to government
by the banking sector; (ii) net domestic assets of the central bank; (iii) net foreign assets of the
central bank; (iv) central bank payments on government expenditure without prior authorization
8

The Fund committed SDR 228.3 million in HIPC assistance at the decision point, of which SDR 3.394 million was
disbursed as interim assistance in three tranches during 2003–05, before DRC’s last PRGF-supported program went
off-track.

25
by the ministers of finance and budget; (v) external arrears; and (vi) nonconcessional external
debt (MEFP, Table 1). The first review is to be completed by end-June 2010 and would cover
macroeconomic developments and policies for 2010 and progress in structural reforms in tax and
customs administration, PFM, and the financial sector. The second review is to be completed by
end-December 2010 and would cover macroeconomic developments and policies for 2011 and
debt sustainability after debt relief.
48.
In the context of the proposed PRGF, an update safeguards assessment of the BCC
is currently in progress. The previous update assessment, concluded in January 2008, found a
strengthened external audit mechanism, but significant safeguards risks remained in the control
framework of the central bank, including serious concerns regarding the bank’s independence.
As a result, the assessment recommended specific measures for implementation in advance of a
Board discussion of a new PRGF arrangement. The BCC agreed with the findings of the
assessment and committed to implementing the safeguards recommendations, some of which
were prior actions and others are structural benchmarks in the proposed PRGF program. Staff is
monitoring BCC's implementation of the measures. The update assessment will be completed by
no later than the first review.
49.
The authorities have strengthened their program monitoring capacity at both the
political and technical level with a view to ensuring coordination across ministries. They
have created a Poverty Reduction Strategy National Steering Commission (PRS-NSC) under the
authority of the Prime Minister which is responsible for supervising two commissions involved
in the design and implementation of the poverty reduction and growth strategy (MEFP ¶46). An
interministerial technical committee will serve as the main counterpart to Fund staff regarding
program monitoring, reporting, and implementation.
VIII. CAPACITY TO REPAY THE FUND AND RISKS
50.
The DRC’s capacity to repay the Fund is satisfactory, assuming debt relief (Table 6).
There are significant risks that, absent higher external balance of payments support and debt
relief under the enhanced HIPC Initiative and MDRI, the DRC would be in a difficult position to
meet its obligations to the Fund. Assuming such external financing and debt relief, repayment
obligations to the Fund would peak at about 3.4 percent of exports in 2009–10 and average about
1 percent of exports in 2010–22. Purchases under the proposed PRGF program would not have a
significant impact on the external debt outlook. They would raise the present value of external
public and publicly-guaranteed debt by a maximum of 2.9 percentage points in 2012 and decline
below 0.7 of a percentage point by 2019.
51.
The implementation of the program is subject to downside risks. An escalation in the
conflict in the eastern provinces and/or exogenous adverse shocks such as a drop in the terms of
trade could dampen economic growth, reduce revenues, worsen macroeconomic imbalances, and
increase inflation and exchange rate volatility. Delayed financial sector reforms could further
weaken the health of the financial sector and destabilize the economy. Weak PFM and
government acquiescence to expenditure pressures (especially on public sector wages) could
undermine the fiscal program and place pressures on inflation and the exchange rate. Lack of
strong political will to carry forward proposed reforms could also derail the program.

26
IX. STAFF APPRAISAL
52.
The DRC faces critical development challenges. Although there has been good
progress in macroeconomic stabilization, challenges remain to establish sustainable growth and
fiscal space for poverty reduction. In this context, staff welcome the authorities’ ambitious
reform agenda, but implementation will require strong leadership to build a broad consensus in
support of the program.
53.
Macroeconomic stabilization requires a prudent and credible fiscal policy.
Expenditure discipline will be critical to achieving the program’s fiscal objectives. The recent
actions by the government to reduce expenditure commitments and delay the repayment of
arrears pending their audit are encouraging. However, durable fiscal discipline will, inter alia,
require the alignment of the treasury and expenditure commitment plans in order to avoid an
excessive build up of commitments as in 2009. Progress on this front will help avoid a build up
in domestic arrears and reduce central bank financing of the deficit. In this context, the
authorities’ decision to bolster the coordination of fiscal policy implementation, including
through the active participation of the council of ministers, is welcome.
54.
Priority spending needs to be safeguarded. Improvements in domestic revenue in the
context of the expected economic recovery should help increase priority spending in line with the
PRGS. A prudent wage policy is also critical for achieving the established macroeconomic
objectives while avoiding the crowding out of priority spending programs.
55.
Strengthening PFM is paramount to enhancing the efficiency and credibility of the
budget process. This involves strengthening revenue collection, rationalizing spending
procedures, minimizing recourse to urgent spending procedures, and improving priority
expenditure tracking. Civil service reform and strengthened payroll management will also be
essential to containing the wage bill.
56.
A tight monetary policy stance is critical for reducing inflation. In this regard, the
recent tightening of monetary policy by the BCC in response to a pick in inflation is welcome.
This policy needs to be maintained in order to achieve inflation objective. To improve the
effectiveness of monetary policy, the BCC should implement MCM TA recommendations
regarding improving liquidity forecast in close collaboration with the Treasury, deepening
monetary policy instruments and foreign reserve management. It should also improve the
transparency of its operations in order to increase the credibility of its monetary policy. Foreign
exchange market interventions should be limited to smoothing daily fluctuations and bridging
private sector demand with forex generated from donor flows.
57. Structural reforms to help enhance the economy’s supply response should be a high
priority. The focus should be on addressing delays in mining sector and public enterprise
reforms, accelerating adherence to the EITI, and reforming the judiciary. The recent
establishment of the office responsible for the implementation of the 2004 anti-money
laundering and combating financing terrorism is welcome.

27
58.
Debt sustainability hinges on debt relief. In the absence of debt relief under the HIPC
Initiative and MDRI, external debt burden indicators are projected to remain above policydependent thresholds over prolonged periods. It is therefore crucial that the government
implements all measures (including the HIPC triggers) required to reach the completion point
under the enhanced HIPC Initiative as soon as possible. Strengthening debt management,
including the avoidance of nonconcessional public debt, will also be important. The amendment
to the SCCA that made it consistent with debt sustainability is welcome.
59.
The staff is of the view that the Lending into Arrears Policy should be applied. This
is based on the financing assurances review conducted by staff, the good faith efforts exerted by
the authorities toward reaching collaborative agreements with commercial creditors, and the fact
that relations with commercial creditors would not undermine the program.
60.
There are downside risks to the program. An escalation in the conflict in the eastern
provinces and adverse exogenous shocks could dampen economic growth, weaken domestic
revenue, and worsen macroeconomic imbalances. Weak PFM and institutional capacity could
also undermine the program. These risks can be lowered by the ongoing internationally
supported peace efforts and increased donor financial and technical assistance.
61.
The authorities’ program promotes sustained high levels of growth and poverty
reduction. Staff supports the authorities’ request for a three-year PRGF arrangement and
additional interim assistance under the enhanced HIPC Initiative. This will help close the
remaining balance of payments financing gap and catalyze donor assistance to support the DRC
in implementing its development agenda. Staff believe that satisfactory assurances regarding
interim HIPC debt relief are in place from the African Development Fund and the International
Development Agency.
62.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation cycle with the DRC be held in
accordance with the provisions on the decision on consultation cycles approved on July 15, 2002.

Table 7. The Democratic Republic of the Congo: Progress Status of HIPC Completion Point Triggers
(As of October 31, 2009)
Triggers

Progress status

1. PRSP
Completion of a full PRSP through a participatory
process and its implementation for one year, duly
documented in the DRC’s annual progress report.

DRC’s full PRSP (2006–08) was (a) completed
through a participatory process, (b) adopted by the
government in July 2006, (c) endorsed by the
democratically-elected government in March 2007,
and (d) submitted to the Bank and the IMF. A priority
action plan (PAP1) for the implementation of the
PRSP (July 2007–December 2008) was adopted in
July 2007 and an updated priority action plan (PAP2)
for 2009–10 was adopted in 2009. Monitoring of the
PRSP implementation suggests that little progress has
been made in the social sectors and that many PRSP
objectives will not be met. The government has
decided to extend the PRSP through 2010, due to early
delays in the beginning of its implementation.
Preparation of a new PRSP (2011–15) began in
June 2009.

2. Macroeconomic stability
Continued maintenance of macroeconomic stability
after reaching the decision point, as evidenced by
satisfactory performance in a program supported by an
arrangement under the IMF’s PRGF.

After unsatisfactory performance on the first PRGF,
the government embarked on a series of staff
monitored programs (SMPs) from April 2006 through
June 2009. Satisfactory completion of the first review
of a new PRGF-supported program will be necessary.

3. Use of budgetary savings resulting from
enhanced HIPC Initiative-related debt service relief
during the interim period for poverty-related
expenditures in accordance with the I-PRSP, with
supporting documentation satisfactory to the staffs of
IDA and the IMF.

Initially a special HIPC account was set up but it has
not been used in recent years. The authorities plan to
assess poverty-related expenditure as defined in the
PRSP in comparison with other expenditures. The
results of this approach are expected in early 2010.

4. Public expenditure management
(a) Implementation of a modernized budget-execution
system, providing information from commitment to
payment, and making it possible to monitor of arrears;

(a) A new budget-execution system has been
introduced in 2003 provides a reasonable amount of
information on expenditure tracking (Chaine de la
dépense). Budget execution reports (États de suivi
budgétaire - ESB) are produced although they need
improvements. Additionally, there are considerable
delays in producing ESB harmonized with the state
financial operations table (Tableau des opérations
financières de l’État - TOFE). Sectoral budget
execution reports are prepared by line ministries and
sent to the Ministry of Budget but are not exhaustive.

37

(b) adoption and implementation of a double-entry
government accounting system and a new chart of
accounts; and

(b) The double-entry system is in place. Staff have
been trained, equipment purchased, and software
developed. However, treasury accounts produced from
the system are not exhaustive or fully reliable.

(c) production of quarterly budget execution reports
using economic, administrative, and functional
classifications.

(c) A new classification has been adopted. Budgetary
reports are produced using economic, administrative,
and functional classifications, but with a lag of two to
three months.

5. Governance and service delivery in priority sectors
(a) Completion of a budget-tracking exercise of
health, education, rural development and
infrastructure expenditure, consisting of (i) monitoring
the execution of poverty-related expenditure;
(ii) evaluation by user groups of the quality of related
public services, and (iii) evaluation by serviceproviders of constraints to effective provision; and

(a) The Treasury monitors poverty-related public
expenditures in all sectors, using the new budget
classifications. The evaluation by user groups of
health clinics and schools and the evaluation by
service providers in education and health were
conducted in 2005 through an Institutional and
Governance Review with World Bank support.
Another survey of users on the quality of service
delivery was launched in April 2009, with results
expected in December 2009.

(b) Adoption and implementation of a new
procurement code and key implementing decrees.

(b) The draft procurement code and its implementing
laws were adopted by the government and in
December 2008 submitted to Parliament which is
expected to be adopted by year-end 2009. Institutions
to operationalize the new code will be established.

6. Social and rural sectors
Adoption of sectoral development strategies and
related implementation plans for health, education and
rural development, that are satisfactory to IDA.

The country health status report (RESP) was issued in
May 2005 and led to the completion of the Health
Sector Strategy in March 2006. This strategy will be
updated during late in 2009.
The Status Report on the National Education System
was finalized in September 2004. An outline of the
sector strategy was drafted in 2006 and integrated into
the full PRSP. Technical work to identify priorities for
reform of the sector was conducted by independent
commissions and finalized in 2008. The World Bank
is currently reviewing the draft strategy for the
primary and secondary education subsector. A note on
the development on higher education strategy is
expected to be completed by April 2010.
An Agriculture Sector Strategy that was finalized in
September 2007 has yet to be validated and adopted.

7. Debt management
Installation and full activation of a computerized debtrecording system, covering public and publiclyguaranteed debt that can (a) produce monthly debtservice projections, and incorporate actual
disbursement and debt-service payment execution
data; (b) produce advance monthly debt-service
projections that will be published quarterly; and
(c) support the centralization of debt information into
a single center.

Debt management software (SYGADE) was installed,
external debt outstanding recorded, and the
implementation program, including the training of
relevant staff for debt management, completed. In
2008 the OGEDEP issued the first statistical report on
public debt as of end-December 2007 using
SYGADE. The final report was due in April 2009 but
has not yet been released. A Prime Ministerial decree
strengthening the role of OGEDEP as the single center
for debt information was signed in February 2008.
The related action plan for OGEDEP was validated by
the Minister of Finance in May 2008, but
implementation is yet to be effected.

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO
LETTER OF INTENT
Kinshasa, November 30, 2009

Mr. Dominique Strauss-Kahn
Managing Director
The International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431
United States of America
Mr. Strauss-Kahn:
As you know, since 2001 the Democratic Republic of the Congo has made progress on both
the political and economic fronts. Indeed, during the period, the government has taken
important steps toward establishing democracy, restoring peace, and fostering national
reconciliation. On the economic front, prudent policies and reforms helped rekindle
economic growth and tame hyperinflation.
The main obstacles that continue to affect economic recovery, despite progress in the
pacification of the eastern provinces, are the continued periodic episodes of instability
created by certain pockets of resistance. This situation has slowed down the implementation
of our development agenda and put a severe burden on our limited budgetary resources.
Economic recovery is also constrained by the lack to adequate infrastructure: dilapidated
roads and railways, insufficient social infrastructure especially hospitals and schools, with
negative consequences for human capital.
Most recently, despite the difficult circumstances brought on by the global financial crisis,
we have persevered in implementing sound policies in the context of our economic program
for the period January–June 2009 which was monitored by IMF staff. Notwithstanding the
significant revenue shortfalls caused by weak mining activity and the high levels of securityrelated spending on account of the conflict in the eastern provinces, the government was able
to abstain from recourse to central bank financing while building up its gross foreign
reserves, broadly in line with the objectives of the staff monitored program. This was greatly
facilitated by the assistance provided by the IMF through the Rapid-Access Component of its
Exogenous Shocks Facility and the catalytic effect it had on generating emergency financial
assistance from other development partners, including the World Bank, the African
Development Bank, the European Commission, and bilateral donors including Belgium.

40
Together, these helped reduce macroeconomic pressures going into the second half of the
year.
The government’s economic program for 2009–12 aims to address the challenges facing the
country in line with our current Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy, which we have
extended through the end of 2010. Further, our second-generation strategy for 2011–15 is
currently under preparation. Our program focuses on enhancing macroeconomic stability,
increasing investment in physical and human capital formation, and the implementation of
structural reforms to improve domestic resource mobilization, strengthen public financial
management, enhance central bank independence, and boost our economy’s productive
capacity. These policies and reforms are set out in the attached Memorandum of Economic
and Financial Policies (MEFP) for 2009–12 and accompanying Matrix of Structural Reforms.
We also attach the Memorandum of Technical Understandings (TMU) that provides the
modalities for monitoring program implementation.
I am pleased to inform you that we made significant progress in addressing earlier concerns
over the debt sustainability implications of Sino-Congolese Cooperation Agreement
involving large mining and infrastructure projects critical to our country’s development. We
agreed with our Chinese partners to remove the government guarantee on the financing of the
mining component (US$3.2 billion) and cancelled the second phase of infrastructure
financing (US$3 billion). This allowed us to limit the government guaranteed borrowing
under the Agreement to strictly the US$3 billion infrastructure component, which is highly
concessional (i.e., grant element of 42–46 percent depending on whether the signing bonus is
taken into account).
In this context, the Democratic Republic of the Congo is requesting IMF financial support
under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) during the period
July 2009–June 2012 in an amount of SDR 346.45 (or 65 percent) of quota. In addition, we
request the resumption of interim relief under the enhanced HIPC initiative in the amount of
SDR 45.66 million (20 percent of the total HIPC commitment) to help us cover part of the
principal payments to the IMF falling due during the twelve month period from
December 2009. IMF support will complement additional budget and balance of payments
support being provided by other development partners, including the World Bank.
The government believes that the policies and reforms set forth in the attached MEFP
are adequate to achieve our program’s objectives. Nevertheless, we are committed to
take any further measures that may prove necessary for achieving the program
objectives. During the period covered by the three-year arrangement, the government
will consult with the staff of the IMF on the adoption of any additional measures
deemed to be appropriate.
The Government will provide the IMF with any information it may request for
monitoring the implementation of the program’s economic and financial policies.
Furthermore, the government will conduct with the IMF a mid-term review of the first
year of the program (July 2009–June 2010) no later than end-June 2010 and a

41
subsequent review of the annual program (January 2010–June 2010) no later than endDecember 2010. The government intends to make the contents of this letter, the attached
MEFP, the TMU, and the related IMF staff report available to the public. Therefore, it
authorizes the Fund to publish these documents on its website once the Executive Board
approves the PRGF arrangement and in the context of the subsequent reviews.

Sincerely yours,

________/s/________

ATTACHMENT I
TRANSLATED FROM FRENCH
DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO
MEMORANDUM OF ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES, 2009–12
Kinshasa, November 30, 2009
I. INTRODUCTION
1. This Memorandum describes the economic and financial policies as well as the
structural reforms that the government intends to implement in its program supported
by an arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) for the period July 2009 to June 2012. Through this
program, the government is pursuing efforts to reestablish the conditions for lasting political,
economic, and social stability. In particular, the proposed policies and reforms are aimed to
address the legacy of decades of poor economic management, armed conflicts, corruption,
and disregard for the rule of law.
2. The government’s three-year program supported by the PRGF arrangement is
based on the Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy (PRGS) paper drafted in 2006 in
the context of a largely participatory approach supported by the democratically elected
government. The strategy is based on five pillars: (i) promote peace and good governance;
(ii) consolidate macroeconomic stability and promote economic growth; (iii) improve access
to social services; (iv) combat HIV/AIDS; and (v) promote proactive community
involvement. Given that these objectives have yet to be realized, the government decided to
extend its PRGS through December 2010, supported by a Priority Action Plan (PAP) which
seeks to correct the weaknesses identified in the July 2008 PRGS progress report. The
weaknesses included delays in implementing public financial management reforms,
unexpected security-related spending, poor revenue mobilization, and weak institutional and
human capacities. During this period, the government will prepare its second generation
PRGS covering the period 2011–15 in a participatory manner.
II. OVERVIEW
3. The government has made considerable progress on the social and political fronts.
Since 2003, the political transition has paved the way for democratization, restoration of
peace, and reunification of the national territory with assistance from the international
community, in particular through the deployment of a United Nations peacekeeping and
institutional-building mission (MONUC).
4. On the economic side, the government successfully implemented its interim
economic program for the period June 2001 to March 2002 that was monitored by IMF
staff (SMP), which ended a long period of hyperinflation and led to the Government’s
Economic Program (PEG) being supported by a PRGF arrangement in April 2002.

43
5. At the same time, the government prepared its Interim Poverty Reduction and
Growth Strategy paper (I-PRGS). The priorities of the I-PRGS paper were restoration and
reinforcement of peace, macroeconomic stabilization, and involvement of communities and
civil society. The I-PRGS paper also identified ways in which new resources to finance the
strategy could be generated. The satisfactory execution of the PEG underpinned by I-PRGS
paper enabled the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) to reach Decision point under
the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative in July 2003 and obtain interim debt
relief. The implementation of the PRGF-supported program and interim debt relief allowed
the Congolese economy, for the first time in a decade, to experience positive rates of growth
and to reduce inflation to below 10 percent in 2003–04.
6. The momentum of the reforms proved difficult to sustain on account of the
continued conflict in the eastern provinces and the preparations for the first national
election in 40 years. As a result, the macroeconomic program went off track and certain
performance criteria were not observed, resulting in the sixth and final PRGF review not
being concluded prior to the expiration of the arrangement and the suspension of the
program.
7. Since 2006, the government has been implementing an IMF staff-monitored
program that has been extended several times after yielding mixed results. The
escalation of the conflict in the eastern provinces made public financial management difficult
and led to significant security-related expenditure overruns that were difficult to offset with
other fiscal measures. In this context, the implementation of the PRGS was less satisfactory
than foreseen.
8. The DRC is facing major post-conflict challenges of reconstruction and
rehabilitation of its dilapidated infrastructure, while maintaining macroeconomic
stability and ensuring debt sustainability. The continued presence and military activities of
rebel forces have set back the implementation of the government’s development agenda and
put a strain on its limited budgetary resources. Economic recovery was hampered by
nonexistent or dilapidated basic infrastructure (roads, railways, hospitals, and schools). These
factors constrain productivity and increase the cost of doing business, thereby reducing
competitiveness. The government therefore aims at achieving its dual objective of rebuilding
the country’s infrastructure and obtaining significant debt relief through the HIPC Initiative
and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI).
III. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS (2008–09)
9. The DRC was affected by the escalation of the conflict in the eastern provinces and
the negative impact of exogenous shocks on the country’s terms of trade following the
onset of the global financial crisis. On the domestic front, the search for a lasting solution to
the security problems in the eastern region of the country resulted in the holding of a
Conference on Peace, Security, and Development of the Great Lakes Region in
January 2008. However, the conference failed to reduce tensions and conflict reemerged in
October 2008, thus jeopardizing the progress made since the end of the political transition

44
and the establishment of the new democratic order. Through diplomatic efforts, the joint
DRC-Rwanda and DRC-Uganda armed forces set out to dismantle the pockets of resistance
created by Rwandan Hutu rebels (FDLR) and Ugandan rebels (LRA) in early 2009. These
events resulted in significant unforeseen budgetary expenditures. Given the urgent and
binding nature of these expenditures, the government at times had to execute them outside
the expenditure chain. At the same time, the reduction in world demand and the sharp decline
in export prices markedly reduced mining revenues. The combination of these endogenous
and exogenous shocks widened the underlying fiscal deficit, increased net credit to
government (NCG) from the banking sector, and reduced gross foreign reserves to less than
one week of nonaid imports.
10. The global financial crisis weakened macroeconomic performance. In 2008, real
GDP growth slowed to 6.2 percent (as opposed to a projected 10 percent) owing to the slump
in mining sector activity. Inflation, which was at 27.6 percent at end-2008, peaked at over
55 percent in the first quarter of 2009, subsided in May and June, but started to rise in July
and reached 54 percent in September in response to periodic strong increases in base money.
At the same time, the Congolese franc depreciated from about CF 555 per U.S. dollar in
September 2008 to about CF 880 per U.S. dollar at end October 2009.
11. The government implemented a stabilization program during the first half of 2009.
It reduced borrowing from the central bank notwithstanding weak revenue performance.
This, combined with a tight monetary policy, helped reduce inflation and stabilize the
exchange rate. Despite these efforts, the impact of the global financial crisis, the continuation
of conflict in the eastern provinces, and the need for the central bank to address liquidity
problems regarding certain commercial banks resulted in deviations from the targets under
our SMP.
12. Government implemented its economic program satisfactorily through the third
quarter of 2009, but expenditure pressures have increased in the fourth quarter. All
prior actions and quantitative benchmarks through September were observed. However, there
was a large build-up of expenditure commitments in September and October reflecting
unavoidable security-related spending and cost overruns on the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) and Economic Community of Central African States
(CEEAC) regional conference hosted by the DRC. The government has already initiated
measures to ensure that program’s fiscal objectives are met.
13. The government made progress in resolving the earlier cases of misreporting to the
IMF. Up to end April 2008, a large number of government accounts held at the BCC and the
commercial banks limited the transparency of government operations. Furthermore, the
government did not always observe proper procedures regarding the payment by the central
bank of urgent government spending, which led the misreporting of data to IMF staff. From
May 2008, to remedy this problem, the government ordered an audit of all its accounts,
including those related to urgent spending. Moreover, in May 2008 it implemented new
procedures to improve the management and transparency of urgent spending. However,
delays were experienced in implementing these procedures. To further strengthen urgent

45
spending management, the government adopted an inter-ministerial decree on
December 29, 2008, that defined the scope for using urgent spending procedures. To date, the
government successfully and transparently applied the new procedures and all payments on
urgent government spending were in accordance with the December 2008 decree.
14. Following the international financial crisis, the government requested the IMF and
other development partners to provide urgent balance of payments and budget support.
In response, the IMF granted approximately US$200 million through the Rapid Access
Component of its Exogenous Shocks Facility. The World Bank granted US$100 million,
disbursed in multiple tranches starting in March 2009, while the African Development Bank
(AfDB) disbursed about US$97 million. Thanks to this support, international reserves rose to
US$250 million at end-July 2009. Other foreign partners, including the European
Commission and Belgium, are providing emergency assistance to the DRC.
15. In order to rebuild the country’s economic and social infrastructure, the
government signed a cooperation agreement with a consortium of Chinese enterprises, which
was amended in October 2009 to be consistent with debt sustainability. The agreement
includes a government guarantee on US$3 billion of financing for infrastructure
development. The repayment of debt service associated with the financing will be covered by
the profits of a joint venture between GECAMINES (a Congolese state-owned company) and
the Chinese enterprises, and the government guarantee could only be invoked in the event
that the joint venture fails to repay the entire debt service 25 years after its legal
incorporation (i.e., 2034). In this context, the government believes that the deal is consistent
with debt sustainability and the level of concessionality expected under a PRGF-supported
program.
IV. MEDIUM-TERM ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES
16. The government is implementing its medium-term economic and financial policies
for the period July 2009 to June 2012 against the backdrop of an improved security
outlook in the eastern provinces. Relations with neighboring countries are being
normalized. Nonetheless, the presence of foreign-armed groups, which continue to terrorize
local populations, and the integration of former rebel elements into the army, continue to
impose large security-related budget and humanitarian costs.
A. Macroeconomic framework
17. The macroeconomic objectives are as follows: (i) achieving an average growth rate of
6.5 percent in 2009–12, sustained by a recovery of mining sector activity and infrastructure
projects; (ii) reducing end-period inflation to 9 percent by 2012 supported by the
implementation of prudent monetary and fiscal policies; and (iii) maintain gross foreign
reserves to the equivalent of about 10 weeks of nonaid imports by the end of the program
period. The external current account deficit (excluding grants) is projected to increase over
the medium term to an average of 34 percent of GDP, owing mainly to a sharp increase in
investment related imports. Exports will gradually recover from the adverse effects of the
global financial crisis as world demand improves. The external current deficit will be
financed by foreign direct investment and development assistance, including debt relief.

46
B. Fiscal policy
18. Medium-term fiscal policy is geared to avoiding government recourse to central
bank financing. The domestic fiscal deficit (cash basis) is targeted to decline from
3.3 percent of GDP in 2009 to 0.4 percent of GDP in 2012. 9 Domestic revenue (excluding the
signing bonus under the Sino-Congolese Cooperation Agreement) is projected to increase
from about 15.7 percent of GDP in 2009 and to 20 percent of GDP in 2012, while
domestically financed expenditure (including exceptional spending) will increase from
17.5 percent of GDP in 2009 to about 20 percent of GDP in 2012.
19. The government is committed to implement a prudent expenditure policy.
Regarding current spending, the policy of standardizing public sector wages of central
government and provinces in 2010 will be maintained, with a wage bill capped at 6.7 percent
of GDP over the medium term. This objective will be achieved by improving the reliability
of the computerized payroll procedure and the rationalization of civil service staffing. The
program will provide realistic allocations for spending on goods and services taking into
account the significant increase in public investment. Over the medium term, domestically
financed investment will increase from about 2.9 percent of GDP to about 5 percent of GDP.
Foreign-financed investment will rise from about 6 percent of GDP in 2009 to about
12 percent in 2012, reflecting large investments in infrastructure, including those under the
Sino-Congolese Cooperation Agreement.
20. Moreover, the government is committed to creating the fiscal space needed to meet
its development and poverty reduction objectives. In particular, a large share of domestic
revenue (40 percent) will be transferred to provinces, which will be responsible for the
implementation of the education, health, and rural sector development. These large transfers
will help strengthen human capital formation especially for vulnerable groups and the poor in
line with our growth and poverty reduction strategy. Further, the country expects to reach the
completion point under the HIPC Initiative in 2010 in order to benefit from debt relief
associated with that initiative and debt cancellation under the MDRI. The government
commits to conducting a prudent external debt management policy, including by relying on
grants and highly concessional loans with a grant element significantly exceeding 35 percent
for development financing. More importantly, the government will refrain from contracting
or guaranteeing new debt that would jeopardize debt sustainability. It also intends to request
from Paris Club creditors the extension over the medium term of the Cologne terms
rescheduling agreement reached in 2002, the rescheduling of arrears accumulated since
July 2006, and an exceptional rescheduling of debt service falling due in SeptemberDecember 2009. It is also planned to normalize relations with non-Paris Club bilateral and
commercial creditors. In turn, it will avoid accumulating any new arrears on
nonreschedulable external debt during the program period. The government will also seek to
reach rescheduling agreements on similar terms with non-Paris Club creditors.
9

Domestic fiscal balance is defined as total revenue (excluding grants and proceeds from signing bonus from
the SCCA) minus total expenditure (excluding foreign financed projects and foreign interest payments due) plus
the BCC’s net operating deficit and net accumulation of domestic arrears).

47
C. Monetary and exchange policies
21. The objective of monetary policy is price stability under a floating exchange rate
regime. The BCC will strengthen the monetary policy framework by making its indirect
monetary policy instruments more flexible, and enhancing its liquidity management and
forecasting capacity. In the interest of transparency, it will adopt a communication strategy to
signal its policies to markets. In addition, the BCC will apply an exchange rate policy aimed
at smoothing exchange rate fluctuations. With a view to improving financial intermediation,
boost confidence in credit institutions, and encourage de-dollarization, the BCC will also
improve the quality of currency in circulation, strengthen banking supervision, and develop a
payments and settlements system.
D. Structural policies
22. Structural reforms are focused on increasing domestic revenue, strengthening public
financial management, restructuring and recapitalizing the BCC, strengthening monetary
policy and banking supervision, and putting the economy on strong and lasting growth path.
The detailed measures and timetable are provided in the attached Matrix of Economic and
Financial Policy Measures.
Revenue and expenditure policy
23. Tax policy (Matrix, I.A.): The government has adopted an action plan aimed at
enhancing the efficiency of revenue collection while expanding the tax base. The main step
will be the introduction of a single rate value-added tax (VAT), to be implemented by end2011. Other measures will be taken to rationalize tax exemptions and streamline the plethora
of duties and taxes and their collection procedures. This effort will be complemented by the
adoption of a new Customs Code in line with international best practices.
24. Customs administration (Matrix, I.B.): The government’s is committed to put in place
an efficient and modern customs administration. To this end, it will streamline customs
procedures to reduce costs to the private sector while improving internal administration and
controls to increase revenue collection. To simplify collection procedures, the government
will expand one-stop customs windows to all important border posts, including in the eastern
provinces. Moreover, it will transfer the customs activities currently performed by the
Congolese Control Office (OCC) to the Custom and Excise Collection Agency (OFIDA),
thereby making it the sole agency in charge of customs valuation and the collection of all
taxes and fees. OCC’s role will henceforth be limited to quality and standards control.
OFIDA will enhance its information technology systems, based on SYDONIA++, in all
customs offices. To improve oversight and ensure the satisfactory implementation of
reforms, OFIDA will be converted into a general directorate of the Ministry of Finance.
25. Tax administration (Matrix, I.C.): The government will also establish an efficient and
a modern tax administration. It will expand the network of corporate tax centers (CDIs) to
manage the taxation of corporations at the national level, and establish tax centers (CIS)

48
focused on middle and small enterprises. The development of a comprehensive taxpayer
databank, combined with the adoption of a single identification numbers for all business
entities, will improve post- and pre-collection controls and expand the tax base. The
government will also strengthen post-collection controls by consolidating the audit and
research functions of the tax department into a single office while improving its information
system.
26. Collection of mining sector taxes (Matrix, I.D.): The government’s objective is to
increase the contribution of the mining sector to domestic revenue, which has been weak thus
far. Accordingly, the government will strengthen the capacity of the tax department’s (DGI)
Large Taxpayers Office responsible for revenue collection from the sector, including by
cooperating closely with specialized audit companies. Further, the collection of royalties and
mining taxes (outside customs) will be transferred from the Directorate of Administrative and
State Revenue (DGRAD) to the DGI, with the relevant legislation planned to be submitted to
Parliament by April 2010. OFIDA will also establish specialized centers to assess adequately
the quality and values of key mineral exports.
27. Public financial management (Matrix, I.E.): The government recognizes the need to
improve public financial management to ensure the efficiency of budget preparation and
implementation. It will implement over the program period an action plan built on the
following five strategic pillars: (i) modernization of the legal framework, including the
adoption of organic law on public finance and of a procurement code; (ii) improvement of
the annual process of budget preparation, based on a medium-term fiscal framework that will
be initially applied to key sector such as health and education; (iii) streamlining budget
execution and cash management to improve the expenditure tracking process in order to
avoid the accumulation of arrears; (iv) strengthening the reporting of expenditure execution
through progressive computerization; and (v) reinforcing ex-ante and ex-post budget
controls, including by the adoption of organic law on the audit office.
28. The Government intends to normalize its relationship with all its creditors. The
government intends to start negotiate with all its creditors, in particular Paris Club creditors
to obtain debt rescheduling in the most favorable terms given the weak repayment capacity of
the country. Regarding the London Club, the government intends to finalize discussions for
the cancellation of the commercial debt in the context of a buy-back program supported by
the World Bank. It will seek to obtain from non-Paris Club creditors debt relief in terms that
are at least comparable to those obtained from the Paris Club.
29. The authorities are putting in place a comprehensive program to address the stock
of arrears and other claims on the government. An action plan for the gradual repayment
of the stock of arrears at end-2007 has been put in place. In particular, fifty percent of the
stock of arrears at end-2007 will be cleared in 2010 and the balance in 2011. A repayment
plan for the stock of 2008 arrears based the internal audit of the Inspection General des
Finances will be designed no later than February 2010. In addition, the government will
establish a plan to compile an inventory of all remaining claims on the government with
proper auditing procedures.

49
Financial sector
30. Central bank restructuring and recapitalization (Matrix, II.A.): The objective is to
enhance the BCC’s operationally capacity while putting it on a sound financial footing.
Accordingly, the first step will be to restructure the BCC in line with the action plan
developed with IMF technical assistance. Following the recent nominations of Director
Generals and Directors, the BCC will put in motion the reorganization of departments and
units within the central bank. It has adopted a three-year strategic plan that aims to improve
governance and reinforce the bank’s capacity to execute effectively its responsibilities. In
parallel, the government will put in motion the process for recapitalizing the central bank,
which is expected to take place in 2011.
31. Banking supervision (Matrix, II.C.): The government’s objective is to strengthen
banking supervision with a view of safeguarding financial system stability and soundness.
Reforms in this area include improving the legal and regulatory framework, enhancing the
operating skills of bank inspectors, introducing macro-prudential functions, and
strengthening on-site and off-site inspection. Particular emphasis will be placed on increasing
the minimum capital requirements for banks, adopting more stringent licensing procedures,
and improving the quality and professionalism of inspectors.
Other structural reforms
32. Civil service reform (Matrix, III.A.): The improvement of administrative governance
through capacity building is critical to national reconstruction. In August 2009, the
government intends to approve a medium-term retirement strategy for public sector
employees and to submit a draft civil service law to parliament in December 2009, including
a regime governing provincial-level civil servants. The civil service census will be completed
in December 2009 and that for the army and police will be completed by December 2010.
33. Business climate (Matrix, III.B.): An improved business climate is at the core of the
government’s strategy to revitalize the private sector. The government is determined to
strengthen the protection of investments by joining the Organization for the Harmonization
of Business Law in Africa (OHADA). It will also convert the National Investment Promotion
Agency (ANAPI) into a one-stop shop for investment in the DRC. Planned changes in laws
and regulations will help reduce red tape in establishing companies and settling commercial
disputes. The government will continue to set up commercial and labor courts in the
remaining provinces and adopt a commercial code aimed at eliminating tariff and non-tariff
barriers, in compliance with the international agreements ratified by the DRC.
34. Decentralization (Matrix, III.C.): The government is placing particular emphasis on
fiscal decentralization consistent with the 2006 Constitution. The Constitution establishes the
principle of revenue sharing between the central government and the provinces. The goal is
to improve the quality of public services at the local level. However, the decentralization
process also poses certain risks, and the government has taken transitional measures to
improve PFM at the provincial level in anticipation of the approval of the organic law on

50
public finance. It will improve the mechanism for allocating national revenue to the
provinces and decentralized territorial entities (ETDs) and to draft laws on the exclusive
functions and powers of the provinces in order to guarantee effective public spending.
35. Debt management (Matrix, III.D.): The government will strengthen external and
domestic debt management in order to limit risks of debt sustainability. To this end, the
government acknowledges the exclusive authority of the Minister of Finance to make
commitments on the government’s behalf regarding borrowing by the central, provincial, and
local authorities. External and domestic debt management will be centralized in the Public
Debt Management Office (OGEDEP), which will produce a biannual statistical bulletin and
quarterly forecasts of public debt service.
36. Economic governance (Matrix, III.E. & F.): Transparency and improvement of
economic governance are important elements of our strategy to encourage private
investment. The government undertakes to publish, within 60 days, the partnership contracts
between public and private enterprises, including the relevant financial and tax details. It will
set up an independent anti-corruption agency. The government also intends to improve the
national statistics in order to enhance the reliability of macroeconomic, social, and
demographic data. Finally, the government will implement the action plan for the Extractives
Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) to bolster the transparency of the mining industries
and their impact on tax revenue.
37. Public enterprises (Matrix, III.G.): The government intends to accelerate public
enterprise reform to improve the delivery of services critical for promoting economic
growth. It plans to divest from all enterprises involved in commercial activities. The process
is ongoing and is implemented in two steps. In the first step, the government has initiated the
privatization of the management of public enterprises, which is aimed at stabilizing and
improving their financial situation. In the second step, the government will develop
restructuring and privatization plan. To facilitate the public enterprise restructuring and
privatization process, the government will develop social programs to help redundant public
enterprise employees eligible to retirement or departing on a voluntary basis and a plan to
address cross-debts between public enterprises and between public enterprises and the
government. Enterprises that are involved in nonprofit activities or that are extensions of
government agencies will be transformed, as appropriate, into public establishments while
those whose activities have ceased or are no longer warranted will be dissolved.
V. POLICY FOR THE REST OF 2009 AND FOR 2010
38. The macroeconomic objectives for 2009 are: (i) a real GDP growth rate of 2.7 percent
sustained by the partial revitalization of the mining and construction sectors and by the
expansion of the agriculture, telecommunications, and transport sectors; (ii) limiting year-onyear inflation at 48.7 percent; and (iii) maintain the coverage of gross foreign reserves at
about 10 weeks of nonaid imports. To attain these objectives, prudent macroeconomic
policies will need to be put in place, as well as structural and sectoral reforms to promote a
business climate conducive to the development of a viable private sector that would underpin
strong and lasting economic growth.

51
39. The objective of fiscal policy for the rest of 2009 is to limit the government’s
recourse to domestic financing. In this regard, the domestic fiscal deficit (cash basis) will
be limited to 3.3 percent of GDP, consistent with a reduction of net credit to the government
of 1.2 percent of GDP. Tax revenue for the year as a whole is estimated at 15.6 percent of
GDP and domestically financed expenditure will be capped at 17.5 percent of GDP. Foreignfinanced investment is projected to reach 6.2 percent of GDP, including infrastructure
projects implemented under the Sino-Congolese Cooperation Agreement.
40. The excessive level of expenditure commitments in the pipeline at end-October
(CF 258 billion) requires corrective measures to ensure consistency with the treasury
plan 2009. Given the level of commitments at end-October, certain sectoral ministries and
other institutions have very little room to maneuver. To address the situation, the government
has (i) cancelled all commitments for which goods and services have not been committed
(CF 68 billion); (ii) postponed the repayment of part of the arrears accumulated in 2007–08
(CF 31 billion), pending their audit; and (iii) stopped all new commitments at end-October.
These measures should allow achieve fiscal policy objectives.
41. The objective of monetary policy in 2009 is to contain inflation in the context of a
floating exchange rate regime. The expansion of the monetary base will be limited to
19.6 percent in 2009. Broad money is projected to grow at 33.8 percent. To achieve the
monetary targets, the BCC will continue to sell BTRs (central bank bills) to mop up excess
liquidity in the economy. Its plan for selling BTRs will be drawn up in close collaboration
with the Treasury. Exchange rate intervention will aim at smoothing undue volatility while
achieving the reserve target. Subject to the reserve target, the central bank also could sell
foreign exchange to help mop up excess liquidity, especially that generated by government
use of external budget support.
42. Key structural reforms for the period July 2009 to June 2010 include the
promulgation of a new organic public finance law, adoption of a world class procurement
code, streamlining of duties and taxes, evaluation and elimination of ad hoc tax exemptions,
the transfer of OFIDA into a department of the Ministry of Finance, the restructuring of the
BCC and the modernization of its monetary policy instruments, and the submission to
Parliament of a new statistics law.
43. The objective of fiscal policy for 2010 will be to limit recourse to domestic
financing. In this context, the domestic fiscal deficit (cash basis) will be limited to
1.4 percent of GDP, consistent with zero net credit to the government from the banking
system. Tax revenue and domestically financed expenditure are both projected to be
17.9 percent of GDP and 18.8 respectively. Foreign-financed capital expenditure is projected
at 14 percent of GDP.
44. The main objective of monetary policy in 2010 will be to further reduce inflation.
In that context, the growth of base money is targeted at 22 percent in 2010. With money
multiplier expected to remain stable, broad money growth is also projected to grow in line
with base money. The BCC will review its policy rate taking into account progress toward
the inflation objectives.

52
VI. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE NEEDS AND PRIORITIES FOR TRAINING
45. The government will request technical assistance from the international
community in macroeconomic and structural reforms. It is grateful for the technical
assistance provided by the IMF through its Central African Regional Technical Assistance
Centers (Central AFRITAC), the World Bank, the AfDB, the UNDP, and other development
partners. This technical assistance will be a determining factor in the success of the
decentralization process and in the formulation and implementation of sectoral policies as
defined in our PRGS. The government will prepare a list of technical assistance needs and
priorities for strengthening institutional capacity at the provincial level.
VII. PROGRAM MONITORING
46. The monitoring of program will be carried out on the basis of quantitative
performance criteria and benchmarks as well as structural benchmarks in the context
of semi-annual reviews (Tables 1–2). The first review will be completed by end-June 2010
and will cover macroeconomic developments and policies for 2010 and progress in structural
reforms in tax and customs administration, PFM, and financial sector reform. An update
safeguards assessment is currently in progress in the context of the proposed PRGF
arrangement, as required by the IMF safeguards policy.
47. In the context of the proposed PRGF, an update safeguards assessment of the
Banque Centrale du Congo (BCC) is currently in progress. The previous update
assessment, concluded in January 2008, found a strengthened external audit mechanism, but
significant safeguards risks remained in the control framework of the central bank, including
serious concerns regarding the bank’s independence. As a result, the assessment
recommended specific measures for implementation in advance of a Board discussion of a
new PRGF arrangement. The BCC agreed with the findings of the assessment and committed
to implementing the safeguards recommendations, some of which were prior actions and
others are structural benchmarks in the proposed PRGF program. Staff is monitoring BCC's
implementation of the measures. The update assessment will be completed no later than the
first review.
48. The government is strengthening its program monitoring and evaluation capacity.
A National Steering Committee on the Poverty Reduction Strategy (CNP–SRP) will be
established directly under the authority of the Prime Minister. This Committee will be
assisted by the Interministerial Technical Committee in the Prime Minister’s Office and will
supervise the activities of the two interministerial committees: one in charge of drafting the
National Poverty Reduction Strategy (CI-SNLCP) and the other in charge of steering and
monitoring the implementation of the PRS (CISPI). The CI-SNLCP will be chaired by the
Minister of Planning, assisted by the other members, namely the ministers in charge of
priority sectors. Its mission will be to steer the process of preparing the national poverty
reduction strategy. As part of its mission, it will work closely with the Steering Committee
for the Poverty Reduction Strategy Preparation Process (UPPE-SRP). The CISPI will be
chaired by the Minister of Finance and its members will include the ministers of Budget,

53
Economy, Planning, Trade, and those ministers concerned with the implementation of the
reforms. It will be assisted by the technical committee for monitoring reforms (CTR). The
government has also established an Interministerial Technical Committee (CTSP) that
monitors the implementation of the government’s macroeconomic program supported by the
PRGF arrangement.

APPENDIX I

ATTACHMENT II
TRANSLATED FROM FRENCH
DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO
TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
ON PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION
Kinshasa, November 30, 2009

1.
This memorandum defines the quantitative targets that will be used to assess the
performance by the Democratic Republic of the Congo under the program supported by the
Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF). It also specifies the content and frequency
of the data needed for program monitoring. Unless otherwise indicated, all the quantitative
targets are measured in terms of cumulative changes since January 1, 2009. Variables
denominated in U.S. dollars will be converted to Congo francs by using the program
exchange rate of CF 639.32 per US$. Variables denominated in currencies other than the
U.S. dollar (excluding SDRs and euros) will first be converted to U.S. dollars at the endperiod US$/currency exchange rate. Variables denominated in SDR will be valued at the
program exchange rate of CF 994.02 per SDR. Variables denominated in euros will be
valued at the program exchange rate of CF 905.07 per Euro.
2.
Institutional coverage: The central government comprises all units of government
that exercise authority over the entire economic territory. However, unless otherwise
indicated for the purposes of this memorandum, the central government does not include
nonprofit organizations controlled and financed by the central government. The banking
system is understood to mean the Central Bank of the Congo (BCC) as well as existing or
newly licensed commercial banks.
I. QUANTITATIVE PERFORMANCE CRITERIA
3.
Quantitative performance criteria were established for end-December 2009 and
end-June 2010, and indicative targets were set for end-September 2009 and end-March 2010
with regard to the following variables:
•

Changes in the net foreign assets of the BCC;

•

Changes in the net domestic assets of the BCC;

•

Changes in net banking system credit to the government (central government);

•

Payments of government expenditures (including emergency expenditures) by the BCC
without the prior authorization according to proper budgetary procedures by the
Ministries of Budget and Finance;

63
•

Nonconcessional medium- and long-term foreign loans contracted or guaranteed by the
central government, local governments, or the BCC;

•

Nonconcessional short-term foreign loans contracted or guaranteed by the State, local
governments, or the BCC; and

•

The accumulation of external payment arrears.
A. Floors on the net foreign assets (NFA) of the BCC

4.
Definition: NFA are defined as the difference between the BCC gross international
reserves and its total liabilities. Gross foreign assets are defined as the sum of the following
items: (i) monetary gold holdings of the BCC; (ii) SDR holdings; (iii) convertible claims on
nonresidents, such as foreign deposits and foreign securities. The following items are
excluded from the definition of gross reserves: claims on residents in foreign exchange,
nonconvertible currency holdings, and reserves that are encumbered or pledged in one form
or another, including but not limited to reserve assets used as collateral or security for foreign
third-party liabilities. Foreign liabilities are all BCC foreign exchange liabilities to
nonresidents (including SDR allocations), including the IMF.
The following adjustments will be made to the NFA floors.

5.
•

Balance of payments support (BPS): NFA will be adjusted (i) upward by an amount
equivalent to total BPS in excess of the programmed levels, (ii) in
July-December 2009 downward by an amount equivalent to the lesser of total
shortfalls of BPS (excluding that from the IMF) relative to programmed levels and
US$45 million; (iii) downward by an amount equivalent to any shortfall in debt relief
under the MDRI from the IMF; and (iv) in January-December 2010 downward by an
amount equivalent to the excess of external debt service payments relative to
programmed amounts.

•

Signing bonus from the Sino-Congolese Cooperation Agreement (SCCA): NFA
will be adjusted (i) upward by an amount equivalent to total disbursement of signing
bonus from SCCA in excess of the programmed levels; (ii) downward by an amount
equivalent to total shortfalls in the disbursement of signing bonus from SCCA relative
to programmed levels.

•

Privatization proceeds in convertible currencies (PPCC): NFA will be adjusted
(i) upward by an amount equivalent to total PPCC in excess of the programmed
levels; and (ii) in July-December 2009 downward by an amount equivalent to the
lesser of total shortfalls in PPCC relative to programmed levels and US$45 million.

64
6.
Definition: BPS includes (all grants and loans) minus (grants and loans for
externally financed projects) plus (debt relief granted by the IMF under the Multilateral Debt
Relief Initiative) minus (external debt service payments (see ¶ 7 below)). External financing
for the National Disarmament, Demobilization, and Reintegration Program (DDR) falls
under the heading of externally financed projects and is therefore not included in the
definition of BPS.
7.
Definition: scheduled external debt service payments (excluding those to the IMF)
are defined as debt service due (principal and interest) minus debt relief (excluding debt
relief offered by the IMF).
B. Ceilings on the net domestic assets (NDA) of the BCC
8.
Definition: The NDA of the BCC are defined as base money (see paragraph 18
below) minus NFA. Based on this definition, the NDA of the BCC include: (i) net credit to
the government (central government) (see paragraph 10 below); (ii) credit to the private
sector; (iii) credit to parastatal enterprises; (iv) credit to commercial banks; and (v) other net
assets.
The following adjustments will be made to the NDA ceilings.

9.
•

BPS: NDA will be adjusted (i) downward by an amount equivalent to total BPS in
excess of the programmed level; (ii) in July-December 2009 upward by an amount
equivalent to the lesser of total shortfalls of BPS (excluding that from the IMF)
relative to programmed levels and CF 35,276 million; (iii) upward by an amount
equivalent to any shortfall in debt relief under the MDRI from the IMF; and (iv) in
January-December 2010 upward by an amount equivalent to the excess of external
debt service payments relative to programmed amounts.

•

Signing bonus from the SCCA: NDA will be adjusted (i) downward by an amount
equivalent to total disbursement of signing bonus from SCCA in excess of the
programmed levels; (ii) upward by an amount equivalent to total shortfalls in the
disbursement of signing bonus from SCCA relative to programmed levels.

•

Privatization proceeds: NDA will be adjusted (i) downward by the total amount of
privatization proceeds (including PPCC) in excess of the programmed level; and
(ii) in July-December 2009 upward by an amount equivalent to the lesser of total
shortfalls in PPCC relative to programmed levels and CF 35,276 million.
C. Ceiling on net banking system credit to the government (NCG)

Definition: NCG is defined as the sum of net BCC and commercial bank claims on the
central government, plus the BCC’s net cash deficit. For purposes of program monitoring,
government deposits related to externally financed projects are excluded from NCG. External

65
budget support (BPS excluding balance of payment support from the IMF) will be converted
to domestic currency by using the market exchange rate prevailing at the time of the
disbursement.
The following adjustments will be made to the NCG ceiling.

10.
•

BPS: NCG will be adjusted (i) downward by an amount equivalent to total BPS
(excluding that from the IMF) in excess of the programmed level, and (ii) upward by
an amount equivalent to the lesser of total shortfalls in BPS (excluding that from
IMF) relative to programmed levels and CF 35,276 million; and (iii) in JanuaryDecember 2010 upward by an amount equivalent to the excess of external debt
service payments relative to programmed amounts.

•

Signing bonus from the SCCA: NCG will be adjusted (i) downward by an amount
equivalent to total disbursement of signing bonus from SCCA in excess of the
programmed levels; (ii) upward by an amount equivalent to total shortfalls relative to
programmed levels in the disbursement of signing bonus from SCCA.

•

Privatization proceeds: the NCG ceiling will be adjusted (i) downward by an
amount equivalent to total privatization proceeds in excess of the programmed levels,
and (ii) in July-December 2009 upward by an amount equivalent to the lesser of total
shortfalls in privatization proceeds relative to programmed levels and
CF 35,276 million.

D. Ceilings on new nonconcessional loans contracted or guaranteed by the central
government, local governments, or the BCC
11.
Definition: With regard to contracted or guaranteed debt, the central government is
defined as all units of government that exercise authority over the entire economic territory,
including nonprofit organizations controlled and financed by the central government.
12.
Definition: Debt is defined in point 9 of the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with
Respect to Foreign Debt in IMF arrangements (Decision No. 12274-00/85 of
August 24, 2000; see Annex).
Ceilings on new medium- and long-term nonconcessional loans contracted or
guaranteed by the central government, local governments, or the BCC
13.
Definition: nonconcessional debt is defined as all loans with a grant element of less
than 35 percent, calculated as the difference between the present value (PV) of the debt and
its nominal value, expressed as a percentage of the nominal value of the debt. The PV of the
debt at the time it is contracted is calculated by discounting future flows of payable debt
service. The discount rates used for that purpose are the commercial interest reference rates
(CIRR) specific to each currency, published by the OECD. The average ten-year CIRRs will

66
be used to calculate the PV of debt having a maturity of at least 15 years, and six-month
average CIRRs for loans with shorter maturity. For the purposes of the program, the most
recent CIRRs published by the OECD will be used to assess concessionality of loans.
14.
Definition: the limit on nonconcessional medium- and long-term loans applies to
contracted or guaranteed debt and liabilities for which the equivalent value has not been
received. It excludes the use of IMF resources and debt contracted within the framework of a
rescheduling or restructuring.
Ceilings on new nonconcessional short-term loans contracted or guaranteed by the
central government, local governments, or the BCC
15.
Definition: short-term debt is defined as debt having an initial maturity of one year or
less, with the exception of regular import credits having a maturity of up to one year.
E. Ceiling on the accumulation of external payment arrears
16.
Definition: external payment arrears include external debt service obligations
(principal and interest) that were not paid on the contractual due date. The ceiling on new
external payment arrears applies continuously throughout the period covered by the PRGF
arrangement. It does not apply to external payment arrears in process of renegotiation or to
cases in which the creditor has agreed to the suspension of payments pending the outcome of
negotiations.
II. QUANTITATIVE INDICATIVE TARGETS
17.
The indicative targets pertain to: (i) base money; (ii) the non-accumulation of wage
arrears; and (iii) the domestic fiscal balance.
A. Ceilings on base money
18.
Definition: base money is defined as the sum of (i) currency outside banks; (ii) cash
holdings of commercial banks; (iii) deposits of commercial banks with the BCC; (iv) private
sector deposits with the BCC; (v) deposits of parastatal enterprises with the BCC; and
(vi) foreign exchange deposits and provisions for imports with the BCC.
B. Ceilings on the accumulation of wage arrears
19.
Definitions: Wage arrears are defined as approved personnel expenses which have
not been paid for 30 days. Wages include the total compensation paid employees (civil
service; including permanent benefits). These arrears will be valued on a cumulative basis
from January 1, 2009.

67
C. Ceiling on the domestic fiscal balance
20.
Definitions: the domestic fiscal balance is defined as (domestic revenue) minus
(domestically financed expenditure). Domestic revenue is defined as (total revenue and
grants) minus (grants) minus (signing bonus from the SCCA). Domestically financed
expenditure is defined as (total expenditure and net loans) minus (externally financed
investments) minus (foreign interest payments) plus (the BCC’s operating deficit) plus (the
net accumulation of domestic arrears).
The following adjustments will apply to the ceiling on the domestic fiscal balance:

21.


BPS: In July-December 2009, the floors on the domestic fiscal balance will be
adjusted upward by an amount equivalent to the excess of total shortfall of BPS
(excluding that from the IMF) relative to programmed levels over CF 35,276 million.



Privatization proceeds: In July-December 2009, the floors on domestic fiscal
balance will be adjusted upward by an amount equivalent to the excess of total
shortfall of privatization proceeds relative to programmed levels over
CF 35,276 million.
III. CONSULTATION CLAUSE

22.
In the event that revenue exceeds the programmed amounts during the program
period, the authorities will consult the IMF before allocating any surplus revenue to
additional expenditure. Further, the authorities will consult with the IMF before
implementing any revisions to the policies contained in the MEFP.
IV. DATA TO BE REPORTED FOR PROGRAM MONITORING PURPOSES
23.
The authorities of the DRC will provide IMF staff with the data needed to monitor the
program within the prescribed time limits, as indicated in the following table.

Annex
Definition of debt

Debt is defined as direct, and therefore unconditional obligation created under a contractual
agreement providing for the provision of value in the form of assets (including monetary) or
services, which requires the debtor to make one or more payments in the form of assets
(including monetary) or to provide services on one or more future dates; these payments
discharge the principal and interest liabilities incurred by the debtor under the contract. Debt
can take a number of forms, including: (i) loans, that is, advances of funds to the debtor by
the creditor on the basis of an undertaking that the debtor will repay the funds in the future
(including deposits, bonds, debentures, commercial loans, and buyers’ credits) and temporary
exchanges of assets that are equivalent to fully collateralized loans, under which the debtor is
required to repay the loaned funds and usually pay interest, by repurchasing in the future the
assets given as collateral to the seller (for example, repurchase agreements or official swap
arrangements); (ii) suppliers’ credits, that is, contracts whereby the supplier permits the
customer to defer payment until sometime after the date on which the goods are delivered or
the services are provided; and (iii) leases, that is, arrangements giving the lessee the right to
use a property for periods of time that are usually shorter than the useful life of the property
in question, but without transferring ownership, title to which is retained by the lessor. For
the purposes of this directive, the debt is the present value (at the inception of the lease) of all
lease payments expected to be made during the term of the arrangement, excluding
payments covering the operation, repair, and maintenance of the properties in question.
Under the definition of debt set out above, arrears, penalties, and court-awarded damages
arising from a failure to make payment under a contractual obligation having the character of
debt also constitute debt. Failure to make payment on an obligation that is not considered
debt under this definition (e.g., payment on delivery) will not give rise to debt.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND AND
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO
Joint IMF/World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis 2009
Prepared by the Staffs of the International Monetary Fund and
the International Development Association
Approved by Mark Plant and Dominique Desruelle (IMF) and
Carlos Alberto Braga and Sudhir Shetty (IDA)
November 30, 2009
This note provides an updated debt sustainability analysis (DSA) for the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC) using the joint Bank-Fund Debt Sustainability
Framework (DSF) for Low Income Countries. The results indicate that the DRC remains in
debt distress, as was the case in the most recent DSA conducted in August 2007. In the
absence of debt relief provided under the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC)
Initiative and Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), external debt burden indicators are
projected to remain above policy-dependent thresholds over prolonged periods. Even after
HIPC/MDRI debt relief, the external debt outlook would be vulnerable to adverse shocks.
External borrowing to finance public infrastructure projects under the Sino-Congolese
Cooperation Agreement (SCCA) are projected to increase significantly the country’s external
debt burden indicators over the medium term, but related risks to debt sustainability appear
manageable.
24.
The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) remains in debt distress. At end
2008 the present value of public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) external debt is estimated at
93 percent of GDP, 150 percent of exports and 501 percent of government revenue
(excluding grants), well above policy-dependent threshold levels. 10 Moreover, all debt burden
indicators are projected to worsen significantly in 2009 due to marked declines in GDP,
exports and government revenue in the wake of the global economic slowdown and
accompanying sharp decline in world commodity prices.
V. BACKGROUND
25. The DRC continues to accumulate external arrears mainly on debt owed to
bilateral creditors. The DRC reached the decision point of the enhanced HIPC Initiative in
10

With an average CPIA rating of 2.80 in 2006–08, the DRC is classified having a weak policy framework.

72
July 2003, qualifying for interim debt relief. 11 The IMF discontinued interim assistance in
June 2006 when the PRGF program went off track. The Paris Club agreed to reschedule
DRC’s debt under Cologne flow terms in November 2003, which was also suspended in
June 2006 when the PRGF program went off track. The International Development
Agency’s (IDA) interim HIPC assistance expired in October 2009. The African
Development Bank/Fund will deliver interim assistance in 2010. The nominal value of PPG
external debt (including arrears) is estimated at US$13.1 billion at end-2008, US$7.1 billion
of which is owed to bilateral creditors, US$4.4 billion to multilateral institutions, and
US$1.5 billion to commercial creditors. Arrears are estimated at US$3.3 billion at end-2008,
of which US$1.5 billion is owed to Paris Club creditors.
VI. EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
26. The baseline scenario in this DSA assumes a strong recovery in economic activity
over the medium term, supported by large investments in mining and public
infrastructure projects. In particular, it assumes that the security situation in the eastern
provinces stabilizes and that the government adopts prudent macroeconomic policies and
makes significant progress on key structural reforms, including strengthening tax collection,
improving budget preparation and execution, and reforming the civil service. The near-term
outlook is dominated by the impact of the global economic slowdown (Box 1), followed by
a strong recovery over the medium term fueled by a US$3.2 billion investment in a mining
project along with US$3 billion in investments in public infrastructure projects envisaged
under the SCCA (Box 2).
27. The baseline scenario assumes that a new three-year PRGF arrangement will be
in place by the end of 2009, which will allow the IMF and the DRC’s Paris Club creditors
to provide additional interim assistance under the enhanced HIPC Initiative. 12 It also
assumes that arrears to bilateral creditors are rescheduled or deferred, the African
Development Bank/Fund delivers interim HIPC assistance in 2010, and that IDA provided
interim HIPC assistance up to October 2009.

11

“Democratic Republic of the Congo—Decision Point Document for the Enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor
Countries (HIPC) Initiative”, and IDA/R2003–0059.

12

The baseline scenario does not assume that the DRC reaches the HIPC completion point in accordance with
current LIC DSA guidelines outlined in: “Staff Guidance Note on the Application of the Joint Fund-Bank Debt
Sustainability Framework for Low-Income Countries”, April 2007and IDA/No. 39748. An alternative scenario
assumes that the DRC reaches the HIPC completion point in mid-2010.

73
Box 1. Democratic Republic of the Congo: Macroeconomic Assumptions for the DSA
Although short-term economic conditions remain weak, the medium-term outlook is positive. The
baseline projection scenario has the following key elements.
•

GDP growth declines from 6.2 percent in 2008 to 2.7 percent in 2009 due to the slowdown in
global growth and the sharp decline in world commodity prices from record levels reached in
mid-2008. Growth rebounds strongly over the medium term, averaging 7.5 percent over the
period 2010–16, spurred by large investment expenditures under the SCCA (Box 2), and a
recovery in mining activity. The mining project financed by the SCCA is projected to increase
real GDP growth by 0.3 percentage points on average during the construction phase 2009–12
and by 0.6 percentage points on average during the production phase in 2013–16. The public
infrastructure projects financed by SCCA are projected to increase real GDP growth by
0.7 percentage points on average during the construction phase 2009–12, declining to
0.2 percentage points in the long run (Box 3).

•

Inflation declines to 48.7 percent by end-2009 and to single digits over the medium term,
supported by prudent fiscal and monetary policies.

•

The overall fiscal deficit (including grants) widens substantially in the short run, reaching
12 percent in 2010, before narrowing gradually to around 2 percent of GDP in the long run as
ongoing reforms expand the tax base and noninterest expenditures decline slowly as a percent of
GDP. Grants decline from 8.7 percent of GDP in 2009 to under 4 percent in 2018.

•

The current account deficit widens from 15 percent of GDP in 2008 to 32 percent in 2011
mainly due to a large increase in imported factors used in the mining and public infrastructure
projects. The deficit narrows thereafter as mining exports expand and investment-related
imports diminish, stabilizing at around 6 percent of GDP over the long run.

•

External financing over the medium term is dominated by loans disbursed to fund public
infrastructure projects under the SCCA, accounting for 22 percent of gross borrowing needs
over the period 2009–14. The average grant element of new borrowing rises steadily from
20 percent in 2009 to 43 percent in 2015 and beyond.

•

Net foreign direct investment declines slightly from an average level of 6.3 percent of GDP in
2004–08 to 5.8 percent in 2009 in the wake of the global economic downturn, recovering to an
average level of 7.2 percent of GDP by 2010–12 led by foreign investment in mining projects.

Box 2. Democratic Republic of the Congo: The Sino-Congolese Cooperation Agreement (SCCA)
In April 2008, the DRC signed a cooperation agreement between a Congolese parastatal mining enterprise
(GECAMINES) and a consortium of Chinese enterprises, forming a joint venture company
(SICOMINES). The net operating income from the joint venture is to be distributed by equity shares with
32 percent going to GECAMINES and 68 percent to the consortium of Chinese enterprises.
The original agreement (signed in April 2008) included a US$3.2 billion mining project, along with
US$6 billion in public infrastructure projects to be implemented in two phases over the period 2009–17.
The agreement was amended in October 2009 to exclude the second phase of public infrastructure projects
totaling US$3 billion that was to be implemented over the period 2014–17, leaving just the first phase of
public infrastructure projects totaling US$3 billion to be implemented over the period 2009–13.
Under the original agreement, the Congolese government provided a public guarantee on the loans for the
mining and public infrastructure projects. However, the public guarantee on the mining loan was removed
in the amended agreement. The public guarantee requires that the Congolese government repay any
principal outstanding on the public infrastructure loans at end 2034 (25 years after the formation of the
joint venture SICOMINES) with capitalized interest.
The US$3.2 billion mining investment is to be financed by a US$1.1 billion interest-free loan along with a
US$2.1 billion loan with an interest rate of 6.1 percent. The US$3 billion investment in public
infrastructure is to be financed by a series of loans to be disbursed for the individual projects, each with a
fixed interest rate of 4.4 percent (LIBOR plus 100 basis points as of April 22, 2008). All loans are
denominated in US dollars.
The consortium of Chinese enterprises provides the DRC government with a US$250 million signing
bonus (“pas de porte”), half of which was disbursed in March 2009. The remaining balance will be
disbursed upon the transfer of the mining concession title to SICOMINES. GECAMINES receives a
US$100 million signing bonus, also disbursed in two tranches.
The mining project is expected to generate operating profits beginning in 2013, which will be used to
repay the mining and public infrastructure loans in three stages. In the first stage, all profits from the mine
will go to repay principal and capitalized interest on US$375 million in “urgent” public infrastructure
loans. In the second stage, 85 percent of operating profits will be used to repay the mining loans. In the
third stage, 85 percent of operating profits will be used to repay the remaining public infrastructure loans.
In the second and third stages, 15 percent of operating profits will be paid to the shareholders of the joint
venture SICOMINES.

Box 3. The Democratic Republic of the Congo: The Economic Impact of Public
Infrastructure Projects
A two-stage approach was used to analyze the long-run growth impact of the US$3 billion in public
infrastructure projects to be undertaken under the SCCA.1 In the first stage, the analysis identified the
location and size of current economic activities (e.g., agriculture, forestry, and mining) and the locationspecific economic potential. Location-specific transport costs take the distance to relevant markets into
account using a “cost-distance” algorithm. Sector-specific responses to changes in transport costs were
estimated and used to simulate the long-term impact of transport investments on production location
levels. Long-term elasticities based on cross-sectional reduced-form regressions were used to estimate the
response of local production to a change in transportation costs. In a second stage, a multiplier approach
was used to gauge the demand side effects of public infrastructure projects during the implementation
phase. The analysis indicates that the public infrastructure projects would raise real GDP growth by
0.7 percentage points on average during the construction phase 2009–13 mainly through the impact of the
higher investment on domestic demand. The growth impact declines to 0.2 percentage points upon
completion of the projects reflecting gains in total factor productivity associated with the improved public
infrastructure.

28. Under the baseline scenario, external debt burden indicators breach
policy-dependent thresholds over prolonged periods (Figure 1). The present value of
PPG external debt exceeds the 30 percent of GDP threshold over most of the 20-year
projection period (Figure 1b), notwithstanding the strong recovery projected over the
medium term. The debt-to-export and debt-to-revenue ratio indicators decline somewhat
faster over the projection period, falling below their thresholds in 2018 and 2019,
respectively (Figures 1c and 1d). This reflects higher export revenues resulting from the
large mining projects and higher tax revenue ensuing from reforms undertaken to broaden
the tax base.
29. The baseline projections are subject to significant downside risks. Given the
DRC’s high dependence on mining exports, the external account and overall economic
outlook remains highly vulnerable to adverse terms of trade shocks. Moreover, poor
governance, unresolved security issues, weak implementation capacity and lower than
envisaged donor support could also worsen the external debt outlook significantly.
30. All debt burden indicators worsen substantially under standard stress tests. The
debt profile is most vulnerable to a shock that entails public sector debt financed under less
favorable terms than assumed in the baseline (Figure 1). 13 The external debt burden
indicators decline somewhat more rapidly under the historical scenario. This reflects the fact
13

The average grant element on net borrowing is only 30 percent in the period 2009–13, well below the
35 percent grant element required to qualify as concessional. The large difference reflects two main factors.
First, the concessionality calculation is based on a much higher discount rate than that used in the DSA. Second,
the DSA includes refinancing of arrears to bilateral creditors on non-concessional terms.

76
that the country had no access to external financing during the conflict period which
restricted the noninterest current account deficit.
31. The external debt burden indicators are projected to breach their thresholds
even if the country were to receive debt relief under the enhanced HIPC Initiative and
the MDRI. If the DRC were to reach the completion point in mid-2010, all three external
debt burden indicators breach their thresholds (Figure 2). The external debt-to-GDP ratio
breaches the 30 percent threshold over the period 2010–18 reaching a high of 45 percent in
2012 (Figure 2b). The external debt-to-revenue ratio breaches the 200 percent threshold
slightly in just two years (2012 and 2014). New purchases under the proposed PRGF
arrangement would account for 6.5 percent of the PV of external PPG debt in 2012
(2.9 percent of GDP), declining to 2.7 percent in 2019 (0.7 percent of GDP). The external
debt profiles are robust to lower long-run growth projections. Reducing real GDP growth by
half of a percentage point after 2017 (which roughly offsets the assumed benefit from the
public infrastructure projects) raises the PV of the PPG external debt-to-GDP ratio by only
1.3 percentage points in 2029. The debt profiles are vulnerable to adverse shocks, however.
In particular, two of the three external debt burden indicators breach their respective
thresholds over the entire projection period under the most extreme stress test
(Figures 2b and 2d).
32. The public guarantee on the infrastructure financing under the SCCA raises the
external debt burden indicators over the medium term but does not have a major
impact on debt sustainability over the long term. Removing the public guarantee on the
loans for the public infrastructure projects would reduce the external debt-to-GDP ratio by
8.6 percentage points on average over the period 2011–16, but would have no impact after
2019 when the loans are projected to be fully repaid (Figure 3). 14 The present-value
calculations underlying the DSA take into account that the public guarantee can only be
invoked after 25 years. 15 If the public guarantee were based on a conventional loan
agreement with a fixed repayment schedule equal to the projected payments from the net
operating income of SICOMINES, 16 the external debt burden indicators would be just
slightly higher over medium term, but with no impact beyond 2019 (Figure 3).
14

The DSA includes the public guarantee on the infrastructure financing made under the SCCA as external PPG
debt, but does not include the debt service payments made by the net operating profit from the joint venture
SICOMINES.

15

To illustrate, consider the following example. In 2009, the Chinese consortium is projected to disburse a total
of $375 million in loans for public infrastructure projects. The legal obligation of the government under the
terms of the agreement is to repay any outstanding balance (principal and compounded interest) in 2034. In
keeping with the conventional for valuing public guarantees, we assume the worst outcome—zero operating
income over the entire 25-year period. This implies a legal obligation of $375 million in principal and
$725 million in compounded interest in 2034, which has a present value of $397 million in 2009 (based on a
discount rate of 4 percent used in DSAs for low-income countries).
16

For example, the $375 million in loans to be disbursed in 2009 is projected to be fully repaid (principal and
capitalized interest) in 2013. This would raise the present value of external debt by $426 million in the case of a

VII. PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
33.
The DRC’s domestic debt is relatively low and as a result, the above external
debt sustainability analysis broadly applies to total public debt, albeit with slightly
higher debt burden indicators (Figure 4). Although information on domestic debt is poor,
the authorities recently provided updated estimates on claims of about US$1.3 billion at
end-2008 (11 percent of GDP). These claims are mainly from suppliers, public enterprises
and public sector employees dating back to the period of conflict in the 1990s. The
authorities are in the process of developing a strategy—to be finalized in mid 2010—to
address with these claims.
VIII. CONCLUSION
34. The DRC would remain in debt distress in the absence of substantial debt relief.
The external debt indicators would breach policy-dependent thresholds over prolonged
periods even with a strong economic recovery over the medium term (assumed under the
baseline scenario). Even if the DRC were to reach the HIPC completion point in mid-2010
and benefit from HIPC/MDRI debt relief, the external debt outlook remain vulnerable to
adverse shocks. The public guarantee on the SCCA financing increases the external debt-toGDP ratio significantly above the policy-dependent threshold level for a prolonged period.
However, these calculations substantially overstate the risk of debt distress because they
assume that the mining project will not generate any net operating profits over the entire
25-year projection period. Calculations based on a model of income generated by the mining
project developed by the DRC authorities predict that the net operating profits from the
mining project would fully repay the public infrastructure loans by 2018, 16 years before the
public guarantee would be invoked. Net operating income would have to decline by
65 percent of the amount projected in the baseline scenario in order for the public guarantee
to be invoked. These calculations indicate that the risk for debt sustainability is manageable.

conventional loan with a fixed repayment schedule, compared to only $267 million in the case where the public
guarantee can only be invoked after 25 years.

Includes both public and private sector external debt.
Derived as [r - g - r(1+g)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and r = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND AND
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO
Joint IMF/World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis 2009
Prepared by the Staffs of the International Monetary Fund and
the International Development Association
Approved by Mark Plant and Dominique Desruelle (IMF) and
Carlos Alberto Braga and Sudhir Shetty (IDA)
November 30, 2009
This note provides an updated debt sustainability analysis (DSA) for the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC) using the joint Bank-Fund Debt Sustainability
Framework (DSF) for Low Income Countries. The results indicate that the DRC remains in
debt distress, as was the case in the most recent DSA conducted in August 2007. In the
absence of debt relief provided under the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC)
Initiative and Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), external debt burden indicators are
projected to remain above policy-dependent thresholds over prolonged periods. Even after
HIPC/MDRI debt relief, the external debt outlook would be vulnerable to adverse shocks.
External borrowing to finance public infrastructure projects under the Sino-Congolese
Cooperation Agreement (SCCA) are projected to increase significantly the country’s external
debt burden indicators over the medium term, but related risks to debt sustainability appear
manageable.
35.
The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) remains in debt distress. At end
2008 the present value of public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) external debt is estimated at
93 percent of GDP, 150 percent of exports and 501 percent of government revenue
(excluding grants), well above policy-dependent threshold levels. 17 Moreover, all debt burden
indicators are projected to worsen significantly in 2009 due to marked declines in GDP,
exports and government revenue in the wake of the global economic slowdown and
accompanying sharp decline in world commodity prices.

17

With an average CPIA rating of 2.80 in 2006–08, the DRC is classified having a weak policy framework.

87
IX. BACKGROUND
36. The DRC continues to accumulate external arrears mainly on debt owed to
bilateral creditors. The DRC reached the decision point of the enhanced HIPC Initiative in
July 2003, qualifying for interim debt relief. 18 The IMF discontinued interim assistance in
June 2006 when the PRGF program went off track. The Paris Club agreed to reschedule
DRC’s debt under Cologne flow terms in November 2003, which was also suspended in
June 2006 when the PRGF program went off track. The International Development
Agency’s (IDA) interim HIPC assistance expired in October 2009. The African
Development Bank/Fund will deliver interim assistance in 2010. The nominal value of PPG
external debt (including arrears) is estimated at US$13.1 billion at end-2008, US$7.1 billion
of which is owed to bilateral creditors, US$4.4 billion to multilateral institutions, and
US$1.5 billion to commercial creditors. Arrears are estimated at US$3.3 billion at end-2008,
of which US$1.5 billion is owed to Paris Club creditors.
X. EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
37. The baseline scenario in this DSA assumes a strong recovery in economic activity
over the medium term, supported by large investments in mining and public
infrastructure projects. In particular, it assumes that the security situation in the eastern
provinces stabilizes and that the government adopts prudent macroeconomic policies and
makes significant progress on key structural reforms, including strengthening tax collection,
improving budget preparation and execution, and reforming the civil service. The near-term
outlook is dominated by the impact of the global economic slowdown (Box 1), followed by
a strong recovery over the medium term fueled by a US$3.2 billion investment in a mining
project along with US$3 billion in investments in public infrastructure projects envisaged
under the SCCA (Box 2).
38. The baseline scenario assumes that a new three-year PRGF arrangement will be
in place by the end of 2009, which will allow the IMF and the DRC’s Paris Club creditors
to provide additional interim assistance under the enhanced HIPC Initiative. 19 It also
assumes that arrears to bilateral creditors are rescheduled or deferred, the African
Development Bank/Fund delivers interim HIPC assistance in 2010, and that IDA provided
interim HIPC assistance up to October 2009.

“Democratic Republic of the Congo—Decision Point Document for the Enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor
Countries (HIPC) Initiative”, and IDA/R2003–0059.

19

The baseline scenario does not assume that the DRC reaches the HIPC completion point in accordance with
current LIC DSA guidelines outlined in: “Staff Guidance Note on the Application of the Joint Fund-Bank Debt
Sustainability Framework for Low-Income Countries”, April 2007and IDA/No. 39748. An alternative scenario
assumes that the DRC reaches the HIPC completion point in mid-2010.

88
Box 1. Democratic Republic of the Congo: Macroeconomic Assumptions for the DSA
Although short-term economic conditions remain weak, the medium-term outlook is positive. The
baseline projection scenario has the following key elements.
•

GDP growth declines from 6.2 percent in 2008 to 2.7 percent in 2009 due to the slowdown in
global growth and the sharp decline in world commodity prices from record levels reached in
mid-2008. Growth rebounds strongly over the medium term, averaging 7.5 percent over the
period 2010–16, spurred by large investment expenditures under the SCCA (Box 2), and a
recovery in mining activity. The mining project financed by the SCCA is projected to increase
real GDP growth by 0.3 percentage points on average during the construction phase 2009–12
and by 0.6 percentage points on average during the production phase in 2013–16. The public
infrastructure projects financed by SCCA are projected to increase real GDP growth by
0.7 percentage points on average during the construction phase 2009–12, declining to
0.2 percentage points in the long run (Box 3).

•

Inflation declines to 48.7 percent by end-2009 and to single digits over the medium term,
supported by prudent fiscal and monetary policies.

•

The overall fiscal deficit (including grants) widens substantially in the short run, reaching
12 percent in 2010, before narrowing gradually to around 2 percent of GDP in the long run as
ongoing reforms expand the tax base and noninterest expenditures decline slowly as a percent of
GDP. Grants decline from 8.7 percent of GDP in 2009 to under 4 percent in 2018.

•

The current account deficit widens from 15 percent of GDP in 2008 to 32 percent in 2011
mainly due to a large increase in imported factors used in the mining and public infrastructure
projects. The deficit narrows thereafter as mining exports expand and investment-related
imports diminish, stabilizing at around 6 percent of GDP over the long run.

•

External financing over the medium term is dominated by loans disbursed to fund public
infrastructure projects under the SCCA, accounting for 22 percent of gross borrowing needs
over the period 2009–14. The average grant element of new borrowing rises steadily from
20 percent in 2009 to 43 percent in 2015 and beyond.

•

Net foreign direct investment declines slightly from an average level of 6.3 percent of GDP in
2004–08 to 5.8 percent in 2009 in the wake of the global economic downturn, recovering to an
average level of 7.2 percent of GDP by 2010–12 led by foreign investment in mining projects.

89

Box 2. Democratic Republic of the Congo: The Sino-Congolese Cooperation Agreement (SCCA)
In April 2008, the DRC signed a cooperation agreement between a Congolese parastatal mining enterprise
(GECAMINES) and a consortium of Chinese enterprises, forming a joint venture company
(SICOMINES). The net operating income from the joint venture is to be distributed by equity shares with
32 percent going to GECAMINES and 68 percent to the consortium of Chinese enterprises.
The original agreement (signed in April 2008) included a US$3.2 billion mining project, along with
US$6 billion in public infrastructure projects to be implemented in two phases over the period 2009–17.
The agreement was amended in October 2009 to exclude the second phase of public infrastructure projects
totaling US$3 billion that was to be implemented over the period 2014–17, leaving just the first phase of
public infrastructure projects totaling US$3 billion to be implemented over the period 2009–13.
Under the original agreement, the Congolese government provided a public guarantee on the loans for the
mining and public infrastructure projects. However, the public guarantee on the mining loan was removed
in the amended agreement. The public guarantee requires that the Congolese government repay any
principal outstanding on the public infrastructure loans at end 2034 (25 years after the formation of the
joint venture SICOMINES) with capitalized interest.
The US$3.2 billion mining investment is to be financed by a US$1.1 billion interest-free loan along with a
US$2.1 billion loan with an interest rate of 6.1 percent. The US$3 billion investment in public
infrastructure is to be financed by a series of loans to be disbursed for the individual projects, each with a
fixed interest rate of 4.4 percent (LIBOR plus 100 basis points as of April 22, 2008). All loans are
denominated in US dollars.
The consortium of Chinese enterprises provides the DRC government with a US$250 million signing
bonus (“pas de porte”), half of which was disbursed in March 2009. The remaining balance will be
disbursed upon the transfer of the mining concession title to SICOMINES. GECAMINES receives a
US$100 million signing bonus, also disbursed in two tranches.
The mining project is expected to generate operating profits beginning in 2013, which will be used to
repay the mining and public infrastructure loans in three stages. In the first stage, all profits from the mine
will go to repay principal and capitalized interest on US$375 million in “urgent” public infrastructure
loans. In the second stage, 85 percent of operating profits will be used to repay the mining loans. In the
third stage, 85 percent of operating profits will be used to repay the remaining public infrastructure loans.
In the second and third stages, 15 percent of operating profits will be paid to the shareholders of the joint
venture SICOMINES.

90
Box 3. The Democratic Republic of the Congo: The Economic Impact of Public
Infrastructure Projects
A two-stage approach was used to analyze the long-run growth impact of the US$3 billion in public
infrastructure projects to be undertaken under the SCCA.1 In the first stage, the analysis identified the
location and size of current economic activities (e.g., agriculture, forestry, and mining) and the locationspecific economic potential. Location-specific transport costs take the distance to relevant markets into
account using a “cost-distance” algorithm. Sector-specific responses to changes in transport costs were
estimated and used to simulate the long-term impact of transport investments on production location
levels. Long-term elasticities based on cross-sectional reduced-form regressions were used to estimate the
response of local production to a change in transportation costs. In a second stage, a multiplier approach
was used to gauge the demand side effects of public infrastructure projects during the implementation
phase. The analysis indicates that the public infrastructure projects would raise real GDP growth by
0.7 percentage points on average during the construction phase 2009–13 mainly through the impact of the
higher investment on domestic demand. The growth impact declines to 0.2 percentage points upon
completion of the projects reflecting gains in total factor productivity associated with the improved public
infrastructure.

See World Bank (2009, forthcoming), “Prioritizing Infrastructure Investments: A Spatial Approach”.

39. Under the baseline scenario, external debt burden indicators breach
policy-dependent thresholds over prolonged periods (Figure 1). The present value of
PPG external debt exceeds the 30 percent of GDP threshold over most of the 20-year
projection period (Figure 1b), notwithstanding the strong recovery projected over the
medium term. The debt-to-export and debt-to-revenue ratio indicators decline somewhat
faster over the projection period, falling below their thresholds in 2018 and 2019,
respectively (Figures 1c and 1d). This reflects higher export revenues resulting from the
large mining projects and higher tax revenue ensuing from reforms undertaken to broaden
the tax base.
40. The baseline projections are subject to significant downside risks. Given the
DRC’s high dependence on mining exports, the external account and overall economic
outlook remains highly vulnerable to adverse terms of trade shocks. Moreover, poor
governance, unresolved security issues, weak implementation capacity and lower than
envisaged donor support could also worsen the external debt outlook significantly.
41. All debt burden indicators worsen substantially under standard stress tests. The
debt profile is most vulnerable to a shock that entails public sector debt financed under less
favorable terms than assumed in the baseline (Figure 1). 20 The external debt burden
indicators decline somewhat more rapidly under the historical scenario. This reflects the fact
20

The average grant element on net borrowing is only 30 percent in the period 2009–13, well below the
35 percent grant element required to qualify as concessional. The large difference reflects two main factors.
First, the concessionality calculation is based on a much higher discount rate than that used in the DSA. Second,
the DSA includes refinancing of arrears to bilateral creditors on non-concessional terms.

91
that the country had no access to external financing during the conflict period which
restricted the noninterest current account deficit.
42. The external debt burden indicators are projected to breach their thresholds
even if the country were to receive debt relief under the enhanced HIPC Initiative and
the MDRI. If the DRC were to reach the completion point in mid-2010, all three external
debt burden indicators breach their thresholds (Figure 2). The external debt-to-GDP ratio
breaches the 30 percent threshold over the period 2010–18 reaching a high of 45 percent in
2012 (Figure 2b). The external debt-to-revenue ratio breaches the 200 percent threshold
slightly in just two years (2012 and 2014). New purchases under the proposed PRGF
arrangement would account for 6.5 percent of the PV of external PPG debt in 2012
(2.9 percent of GDP), declining to 2.7 percent in 2019 (0.7 percent of GDP). The external
debt profiles are robust to lower long-run growth projections. Reducing real GDP growth by
half of a percentage point after 2017 (which roughly offsets the assumed benefit from the
public infrastructure projects) raises the PV of the PPG external debt-to-GDP ratio by only
1.3 percentage points in 2029. The debt profiles are vulnerable to adverse shocks, however.
In particular, two of the three external debt burden indicators breach their respective
thresholds over the entire projection period under the most extreme stress test
(Figures 2b and 2d).
43. The public guarantee on the infrastructure financing under the SCCA raises the
external debt burden indicators over the medium term but does not have a major
impact on debt sustainability over the long term. Removing the public guarantee on the
loans for the public infrastructure projects would reduce the external debt-to-GDP ratio by
8.6 percentage points on average over the period 2011–16, but would have no impact after
2019 when the loans are projected to be fully repaid (Figure 3). 21 The present-value
calculations underlying the DSA take into account that the public guarantee can only be
invoked after 25 years. 22 If the public guarantee were based on a conventional loan
agreement with a fixed repayment schedule equal to the projected payments from the net
operating income of SICOMINES, 23 the external debt burden indicators would be just
slightly higher over medium term, but with no impact beyond 2019 (Figure 3).
21

The DSA includes the public guarantee on the infrastructure financing made under the SCCA as external PPG
debt, but does not include the debt service payments made by the net operating profit from the joint venture
SICOMINES.
22

To illustrate, consider the following example. In 2009, the Chinese consortium is projected to disburse a total
of $375 million in loans for public infrastructure projects. The legal obligation of the government under the
terms of the agreement is to repay any outstanding balance (principal and compounded interest) in 2034. In
keeping with the conventional for valuing public guarantees, we assume the worst outcome—zero operating
income over the entire 25-year period. This implies a legal obligation of $375 million in principal and
$725 million in compounded interest in 2034, which has a present value of $397 million in 2009 (based on a
discount rate of 4 percent used in DSAs for low-income countries).
23

For example, the $375 million in loans to be disbursed in 2009 is projected to be fully repaid (principal and
capitalized interest) in 2013. This would raise the present value of external debt by $426 million in the case of a

XI. PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
44.
The DRC’s domestic debt is relatively low and as a result, the above external
debt sustainability analysis broadly applies to total public debt, albeit with slightly
higher debt burden indicators (Figure 4). Although information on domestic debt is poor,
the authorities recently provided updated estimates on claims of about US$1.3 billion at
end-2008 (11 percent of GDP). These claims are mainly from suppliers, public enterprises
and public sector employees dating back to the period of conflict in the 1990s. The
authorities are in the process of developing a strategy—to be finalized in mid 2010—to
address with these claims.
XII. CONCLUSION
45. The DRC would remain in debt distress in the absence of substantial debt relief.
The external debt indicators would breach policy-dependent thresholds over prolonged
periods even with a strong economic recovery over the medium term (assumed under the
baseline scenario). Even if the DRC were to reach the HIPC completion point in mid-2010
and benefit from HIPC/MDRI debt relief, the external debt outlook remain vulnerable to
adverse shocks. The public guarantee on the SCCA financing increases the external debt-toGDP ratio significantly above the policy-dependent threshold level for a prolonged period.
However, these calculations substantially overstate the risk of debt distress because they
assume that the mining project will not generate any net operating profits over the entire
25-year projection period. Calculations based on a model of income generated by the mining
project developed by the DRC authorities predict that the net operating profits from the
mining project would fully repay the public infrastructure loans by 2018, 16 years before the
public guarantee would be invoked. Net operating income would have to decline by
65 percent of the amount projected in the baseline scenario in order for the public guarantee
to be invoked. These calculations indicate that the risk for debt sustainability is manageable.

conventional loan with a fixed repayment schedule, compared to only $267 million in the case where the public
guarantee can only be invoked after 25 years.

Gross general government debt.
Gross financing need is defined as the primary deficit plus debt service plus the stock of short-term debt at the end of the last period.
Revenues excluding grants.
Debt service is defined as the sum of interest and amortization of medium and long-term debt.
Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.

Effective February 10, 2003, the DRC accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2 (a), 3,
and 4, of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement; however, the DRC maintains measures that give rise
to one restrictions and one multiple currency practice subject to Fund approval. The exchange
restrictions involves an outstanding net debt position against other contracting members under the
inoperative regional payments agreement with the Economic Community of the Great Lakes
Countries. The multiple currency practice relates to a fixed exchange rate set quarterly applying to
transactions through the bilateral payments agreement with Zimbabwe.

Safeguards Assessment:
A safeguards assessment of the central bank (BCC) was completed on December 24, 2002, and
updated in January 2008. Both initial and updated assessments concluded that there may be
substantial risks of misreporting or misuse due to vulnerabilities in the external audit mechanism,
financial reporting, and system of internal controls. Staff findings, recommendations related to
program conditionality, and other recommendations may be found in IMF Country Report
No. 03/161 and IMF Country Report No. 07/328. In the context of the proposed PRGF, an update
safeguards assessment of the Banque Centrale du Congo (BCC) is currently in progress.

Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance

General: Data provision to the Fund is broadly adequate for surveillance and program monitoring purposes, but upgrades to the national
accounts, balance of payments, and government finance statistics would be helpful. In spite of difficulties, the authorities have continued to
produce an array of economic and financial statistics, most of which are published in the annual report of the Central Bank of the Congo
(BCC) or its monthly statistical bulletin.
National accounts: Annual national accounts are compiled in constant and current prices by the Directorate of Research of the BCC and
published yearly. The compilation methodology conforms to the System of National Accounts 1968 (1968 SNA) and is based on the balance
sheets of enterprises and surveys of public and semipublic enterprises and agencies, most of which date from the late 1980s. The activities
of the traditional sector (including the informal sector) are estimated with extrapolation techniques using industry-specific data that are
outdated. As a result, GDP is likely to be underestimated.
With assistance from AFRITAC, work on the national accounts is underway to update the base year to 2005, incorporate the results of a
recent 1-2–3 household survey, as well as implement the methodological recommendations of the 1993 SNA. While outputs of this work
remain to be validated and officially published, as expected, the 2005 GDP estimates show a considerable upward revision compared to
previously published estimates.
Price statistics: Consumer price indices are calculated for Kinshasa by the BCC, the National Statistics Institute (INS), the Institute of
Economic and Social Research (IESR), and the Economics Section of the U.S. Embassy in Kinshasa. The IESR also calculates a monthly
consumer price index for the Lubumbashi market. The household surveys on which these calculations are based date back to the late 1980s;
they need to be updated to account for changes in household consumption patterns and demographic shifts, while geographical coverage
should be expanded.
Government finance statistics: The BCC produces aggregated monthly statistics on a cash basis based on its own accounting for the
government cash operations. The treasury produces two sets of monthly statistics based on its own records: one relates to the transactions
executed through the BCC, the other set attempts to consolidate operations through commercial bank accounts and off-budget operations.
These statistics do not rely on an integrated double-entry public accounting system and do not provide sufficient details about the nature of
expenditures owing to problems in the expenditure chain. However, the treasury has started to produce quarterly expenditure data reports by
ministry and institution.
The current work on tax administration and expenditure control is expected to improve the quality and timeliness of fiscal statistics. In
parallel with technical assistance on public expenditure management, a STA multisector statistics advisor has been advising on government
finance statistics, producing improvements in the quality of the statistics. Furthermore, adoption of a simplified double-entry bookkeeping
system should significantly improve the availability of data on government financial operations.
In 2003 the DRC reported annual data up to 2002 for the IMF’s Government Finance Statistics Yearbook in the format of the Government
Finance Statistics Manual 2001, but has not reported subsequently.
Monetary statistics: The BCC Directorate of Research regularly produces timely monetary statistics. These statistics are now generally
reliable, but some problems remain with the classification of accounts.
Since STA money and banking statistics mission of June 2000, BCC reporting of data for publication in the IMF’s International Financial
Statistics (IFS) has improved and monetary data are currently reported on time. A 2003 multisector statistics mission recommended a new
chart of accounts for the BCC and other deposit-taking institutions, including the information needed for improved sectorization of
economic units and classification of financial assets.
Balance of payments: Annual balance of payments statistics are compiled with information on the exports and imports of large public and
semipublic enterprises, BCC payment records, and a survey of the foreign operations of residents. The estimates also take account of
information on the informal sector and foreign aid flows provided by the World Bank and the local UN Development Program (UNDP)
office, which collects the data from the European Union, embassies, and nongovernmental organizations. However, the 2003 multisector
mission found that, due to computer problems, data have not been processed since 1999, so in effect balance of payments statistics are
compiled using data from different sources, supplemented by estimates. The mission suggested that the BCC implement a system of
quarterly surveys of corporations that are authorized to hold accounts overseas. The mission also recommended reinvigoration of a working
group comprising staff of the customs and other agencies to prepare quarterly foreign trade data and take measures to improve data on
services and transfers. No external sector data are reported to STA for publication.

Press Release No. 09/455
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
December 11, 2009

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Approves US$551 Million PRGF Arrangement for the Democratic
Republic of the Congo and US$73 Million in Interim HIPC Assistance
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today approved a three-year, SDR
346.45 million (about US$551.45 million) arrangement for the Democratic Republic of the Congo
under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF). The Executive Board also approved
additional interim assistance of SDR 45.66 million (about US$72.68 million) under the enhanced
Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative to reduce the DRC’s debt service payments to the
IMF.
Satisfactory completion of the first review of the government’s PRGF-supported economic program
is a key requirement for the DRC to reach the completion point under the enhanced HIPC Initiative
and to benefit from the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), which together could result in
relief from the vast majority of the country’s external debt. Other requirements for the HIPC
completion point are 12 months of satisfactory implementation of the government’s Poverty
Reduction and Growth Strategy (PRGS) and other measures--including in social areas such as
healthcare and education--which were agreed when the DRC reached its HIPC Decision Point in July
2003.
Following the Executive Board’s discussion of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mr. John
Lipsky, First Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair, said:
“The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has made important socioeconomic progress since
2001, demonstrated by the political transition to a democratically-elected government, robust rates of
economic growth, and the taming of hyperinflation. Nonetheless, socioeconomic conditions remain
poor; the country’s infrastructure is dilapidated; and the country’s external debt is unsustainable. The
global economic crisis has further aggravated these conditions.

111
“The new three-year PRGF arrangement will support the authorities’ implementation of their poverty
reduction and growth strategy and economic reform program. The key priorities are to generate
strong economic growth, reduce inflation to single digits, strengthen public financial management,
achieve debt sustainability, and accelerate structural reforms.
“Prudent and credible fiscal policies are key to addressing fiscal dominance over monetary policy
and making progress toward fiscal sustainability. The authorities aim to bolster domestic revenue,
strengthen expenditure management, and implement a prudent wage policy to support fiscal
consolidation while expanding priority spending programs. The authorities are committed to avoiding
recourse to bank financing over the medium term.
“Monetary policy will continue to focus on reducing inflation. The central bank aims to enhance the
effectiveness of monetary policy by improving its liquidity forecasting capacity and strengthening
coordination with the Treasury. Completion of the restructuring and recapitalization of the central
bank is important to enhance the central bank’s credibility and independence. The central bank’s
supervision of the commercial banks also needs to be strengthened.
“The DRC’s flexible exchange rate regime has served the country well. The central bank will limit
intervention in the foreign exchange market to smoothing short-term volatility and achieving its gross
official reserve target.
“Strong and sustained economic growth requires implementation of key structural reforms. The
authorities will focus on public enterprise reform, improving governance, and streamlining the
business regulatory environment.
“Given the DRC’s high debt burden, the authorities recognize the need for prudent debt management.
They aim to meet the enhanced HIPC Initiative requirements and triggers to reach the completion
point and receive debt relief under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative as early as possible.
Continued highly concessional assistance from the donor community will be necessary to support the
authorities’ reform efforts.”

ANNEX

Recent Economic Developments
Socioeconomic conditions in the DRC remain dire following a decade-long conflict that has had
enormous human costs and resulted in widespread destruction of the country’s social and economic
infrastructure. Although rich in natural resources, the country’s per capita income and human
development indicators remain among the lowest in Africa.
A sharp decline in world commodity prices in late 2008 slowed economic growth in 2009 to a
projected 2.7 percent, while the escalation of conflict in the eastern provinces led to higher security
spending, increased government borrowing from the central bank, and an upsurge in inflation and
depreciation of the exchange rate during the first quarter of 2009. The Congolese franc depreciated
by 35 percent against the U.S. dollar between December 2008 and September 2009. Reserves
declined to a historically low level of US$30 million in February 2009 before rising to
US$894 million at end-September following the disbursement of emergency assistance from the
Fund and other development partners, the arrival of the first tranche of the Sino-Congolese
Cooperation Agreement (SCCA) signing bonus, and the IMF’s general and special SDR allocations
(SDR 424.5 million).
The DRC is in debt distress with an external debt stock of about US$13.1 billion and debt service
amounting to about one-fourth of total expenditure. At the end of 2008, publicly contracted or
guaranteed external debt was an estimated 93 percent of GDP, 150 percent of exports, and
502 percent of government revenue, excluding foreign aid. The DRC reached the decision point of
the enhanced HIPC Initiative in July 2003. It is current on repayments to multilateral financial
institutions including the IMF, but continues to accumulate arrears vis-à-vis bilateral and commercial
creditors. IMF staff received financing assurances in November 2009 regarding the rescheduling of
the DRC’s debts to the Paris Club of sovereign bilateral creditors.
Program Summary
The Congolese Authorities’ program for the three years to June 2012 includes the following targets:
(i) average real GDP growth of 5.5 percent; (ii) end-period inflation rate of 9 percent by 2012;
(iii) gross reserves equivalent to 10 weeks of nonaid imports by 2012; and (iv) the external current
account deficit (including grants) limited to an average of 25 percent of GDP.
The program includes structural reforms that focus on:
• Improving domestic revenue mobilization by expanding the tax base and improving its
management
• Strengthening public financial management through improved budget preparation, execution
and accountability

•

•

113
Reforming the central bank reform, with a focus on restoring the independence of the Banque
Centrale du Congo and strengthening its supervisory capacity with technical assistance from
the IMF’s Monetary and Capital Markets department
Developing the private sector, including the reform of public enterprises, streamlining
government regulations, protecting foreign investment and improving transparency in natural
resource management.

The authorities’ 2006–08 PRGS, which has been extended through 2010 and endorsed by IMF staff,
is based on the five pillars: promotion of peace and good governance; consolidation of
macroeconomic stability and promotion of economic growth; improvement in access to social
services; the fight against HIV/AIDS; and promotion of a dynamic community.
The DRC became a member of the IMF on September 28, 1963 and has a quota in the Fund of
SDR 533 million. The DRC’s previous PRGF arrangement, approved in June 2002 in the sum of
SDR 580 million (US$924 million -- see Press Release No. 02/27), was almost fully drawn
(SDR 553.47 million) before it expired in March 2006 without completion of the sixth review. IMF
staff have subsequently monitored the Congolese authorities’ economic program through a series of
staff monitored programs. On March 12, 2009, the Executive Board approved a disbursement in an
amount equivalent to SDR 133.25 million (about US$212 million) to the Democratic Republic of the
Congo under the Rapid-Access Component of the Exogenous Shocks Facility (RAC-ESF – see Press
Release No. 09/74).

Statement by Mr. Rutayisire, Executive Director
Democratic Republic of the Congo
December 11, 2009
On behalf of my Congolese authorities, I would like to thank Management and staff for maintaining
dialogue with the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) throughout the years, amid difficult
circumstances. In particular, I thank the Managing Director for his fruitful visit to Kinshasa in
May 2009 which contributed to set the way forward in the relations between the DRC and the IMF. I
would also like to commend staff for their quality advice and technical assistance to my Congolese
authorities and, notably, for the constructive policy discussions held during their visits to DRC in the
context of the 2009 Article IV consultation and program negotiations.
The Democratic Republic of the Congo has come a long way from a period of civil conflicts and
macroeconomic instability. The process of reconciliation and peace embarked upon in 2001 resulted
in encouraging economic results supported by the international community, notably the IMF. The
overall implementation of the 2002–06 PRGF arrangement and subsequent staff-monitored programs
(SMPs), while not always smoothly implemented due to capacity constraints, repeated conflicts and
external shocks, testify of the authorities’ willingness and ability to pursue sound macroeconomic
policies and structural reforms.
To address the capacity constraints and other perceived risks to their program, my Congolese
authorities have, in agreement with Fund staff, designed a series of reforms, notably to enhance
public financial management and strengthen the central bank through restructuring and
recapitalization. They have already put in place institutional committees at both the political and
technical levels, with the view to enhance the government’s program coordination, monitoring and
evaluation capacity. Their structural reform agenda also includes boosting domestic revenue
mobilization, promoting private sector development and diversifying the economy, with the aim to
enhance the economy’s capacity to better weather exogenous shocks. In particular, improving the
business climate is at the core of the authorities’ strategy to revitalize the private sector, and this
objective has been forcefully reasserted at the highest level recently. As for the risks related to a
reemergence of conflicts, my authorities are pushing ahead their peace efforts, as evidenced by an
agreement reached early this year with rebel groups in the eastern provinces and consolidation of
improved relations with neighboring countries, including at the diplomatic level. My authorities also
count on increased financial and technical support of the international community, which are
essential to sustaining their actions.
My authorities are fully aware that their reconstruction and development efforts are predicated on
their attracting direct foreign investments and allocating considerable resources to infrastructure and
the priority sectors of education, health and agriculture. These in turn depend on the country
benefiting from significant debt relief under the HIPC Initiative and the MDRI given that the country
is in debt distress. To this vein, my authorities are fully committed to meeting the HIPC trigger points
set forth at the decision point, pursuing their poverty reduction efforts through the implementation of
the country’s updated Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy (PRGS), and implementing their
agenda of short- and medium-term economic policies and reforms laid out in their Memorandum of
Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP).

117
Despite the challenging external environment and domestic conditions, the performance of the most
recent SMP has been satisfactory. All prior actions towards the PRGF-supported program and
indicative targets through end-September were observed, while implementation of the structural
reform agenda remains on track. These prior actions include measures to strengthen revenue
mobilization; promote development of the private sector through identifying government arrears and
adopting a plan to eliminate them; make operational the national financial intelligence unit; amend
the Sino-Congolese cooperation agreement with the aim of meeting the concessionality and debt
sustainability requirements; set the initial stage to reinforce program monitoring and control via
audits of the PRGF criteria; and making institutional steps to modernize the central bank and improve
its monetary policy design and banking supervision.
Based on these achievements and demonstrated commitment to sound policies and reforms going
forward, my DRC authorities request Fund’s financial support under a three-year PRGF arrangement
with an access level of 65 percent of quota, adequate to meet the anticipated financing gap over
2009–12. They also request an additional interim assistance under the HIPC Initiative.
I. Recent Economic Developments
Against the backdrop of escalated conflict in 2008, consequent urgent spending pressures, global
financial crisis and supply bottlenecks, economic activity in 2008 and 2009 fell short of the initial
projections, reaching 6 percent and 2.7 percent respectively. Inflation has been on the rise in recent
months, reaching more than 50 percent on an annual basis at end-October 2009 due to the
aforementioned budget pressures and consequent government borrowing from the central bank,
Banque Centrale du Congo (BCC). Moreover, the global financial crisis has contributed to wide the
current account deficit, while the Congolese franc depreciated significantly against the U.S. dollar
throughout the period of December 2008 to November 2009.
The fragile state of the banking sector, as evidenced by the capital adequacy, liquidity and net foreign
exchange position ratios as well as the elevated foreign currency risk, is being addressed notably
through tightening and enforcing prudential regulations and strengthening on-site and off-site
banking supervision. The BCC is implementing this comprehensive strategy with technical assistance
of the Fund and the World Bank. It is also taking steps to restructure one large bank.
Despite the recent difficult environment, the medium-term outlook remains bright, with growth
projections of about 6 percent annually over 2010–12, owing to higher public and private investment
and a recovery in the mining sector; declining inflation down to single digit by 2012 and significant
capital and financial flows linked to large infrastructure and mining projects. My DRC authorities
have, in close collaboration with Fund staff, designed a medium-term program underpinned by
conservative assumptions and aiming at realistic objectives.
II. The Medium-ter m Economic Pr ogr am
The design of DRC’s 2009–12 economic program has built on the recommendations from the 2009
Article IV consultation which itself draws from the 2007 Article IV consultation. My authorities
broadly agree with Fund staff recommendations aimed at fostering sustained and high growth,
enhancing external sustainability and strengthening institutional capacity for better economic

118
management. In some instances, the authorities are taking steps towards meeting these objectives,
notably pushing forward DRC participation in OHADA to help simplify procedures for business
registration and strengthen legal protection for foreign investment and amending an important
cooperation agreement in the mining and infrastructure sectors to minimize risks of external debt
distress.
Fiscal policy
The medium-term fiscal policy is geared at preventing government recourse to central bank
financing. The authorities intend to reach a domestic fiscal deficit of 0.4 percent of GDP in 2012. On
the revenue side, efforts will aim at mobilizing greater domestic revenue through the implementation
of an action plan to enhance the efficiency of revenue collection and expand the tax base via the
introduction of a single rate VAT; measures to rationalize tax exemptions and streamline duties and
taxes; modernize the customs and tax administrations; as well as efforts to increase the contribution
of the mining sector to domestic revenue by strengthening the Large Taxpayers Office responsible,
within the tax department, for revenue collection from the sector. The authorities also recognize the
need to enhance public financial management and will implement a five-pillar action plan to this end,
as laid out in paragraph 27 of their MEFP.
On the expenditure side, the authorities are committed to implement a prudent policy, with a wage
bill capped at 6.7 percent of GDP over the medium term, while maintaining the policy of
standardizing public sector wages of central government and provinces in 2010. This will be attained
by enhancing the computerized payroll procedure and rationalizing civil service personnel. Both
domestically- and foreign-financed investment will double as a percentage of GDP over the course of
the program on account of large investments in infrastructure.
In implementing their fiscal policy, my authorities will put emphasis on creating fiscal space needed
to meet the country’s poverty reduction objectives, notably by transferring the constitutionallymandated 40 percent of domestic revenue to provinces, which become responsible for the
implementation of education, health and rural sector development.
Monetary and exchange policies
The goal of monetary policy remains price stability under a floating exchange rate regime, which has
served the economy well as a buffer to external shocks. To make monetary policy more effective, the
BCC will strengthen its policy framework by introducing more flexibility in the indirect monetary
policy instruments (open market operations and reserve requirements) and enhancing its liquidity
management and forecasting capacity. It will also improve its communication strategy to better signal
policies to market participants. The central bank will intervene in foreign exchange market only to
smooth out exchange rate fluctuations.
Financial sector policies
The authorities will strive to enhance the BCC’s operational capacity and put it on a sound financial
footing through restructuring and recapitalization, with technical assistance from the IMF. They have
adopted an action plan to improve governance and strengthen the central bank’s operational

119
effectiveness. The recapitalization of the Bank, to be provided by the government, is expected in
2011.
Regarding the banking sector, the authorities aim at safeguarding financial system stability and
soundness through an improved regulatory framework, including increased minimum capital
requirements for banks and more rigorous licensing procedures; enhanced supervision notably human
capacity; strengthened on- and off-site inspection; and macro-prudential functions.
Other structural reforms
Other structural measures will contribute to reforming the civil service, with the view to streamline it
and make it more efficient, and improving economic governance and the business climate to promote
private sector-led growth, as detailed in paragraphs 32–36 of the authorities’ MEFP. In the same
vein, the authorities intend to accelerate the reforms of public enterprises to improve the delivery of
services indispensable for boosting growth. In this regard, the government plans to divest from all
public enterprises with commercial activities, towards their privatization.
III. SHORT-TERM POLICIES AND REFORMS
My authorities recognize that the immediate risks to macroeconomic stability brought about by the
current challenging environment ought to be addressed by tightening fiscal and monetary policies and
promoting structural and sectoral reforms to pave the way for a viable private sector and for high and
lasting economic growth. Already, on the fiscal policy front, they have cancelled all expenditure
commitments up to year-end for which goods and services have not been delivered, and postponed
the repayment of part of the arrears accumulated in 2007–08, pending their audit.
As regards monetary and exchange policies, the BCC will pursue the sales of central bank bills, in
close collaboration with the Treasury, to mop up excess liquidity in the economy. Exchange market
intervention will aim at smoothing unwarranted exchange rate volatility and potentially mopping up
excess liquidity.
In the structural reform area, the agenda throughout June 2010 includes the promulgation of a new
organic public finance law, adoption of a modern procurement code, streamlining duties and taxes,
rationalization of tax exemptions, the continuing restructuring of the BCC, the modernization of the
central bank’s monetary policy instruments, and the submission to Parliament of a new statistics law.
IV. Debt sustainability and the HIPC pr ocess
The updated debt sustainability analysis conducted jointly by Fund and World Bank staffs show that
the DRC remains in debt distress. Absent debt relief under the HIPC Initiative and MDRI, its external
debt burden indicators are projected to remain above the policy-dependent thresholds over a
protracted periods even with a strong recovery over the medium term. As debt distress continues to
exert a drag on the economy, the DRC is in dire need to reach the HIPC completion point as soon as
possible. The authorities expect to meet all the completion point requirements, including the trigger
points, in 2010, in order to benefit from substantial debt relief and allocate freed domestic resources
and additional external support to their poverty reduction and reconstruction efforts.

120
Furthermore, even with the HIPC/MDRI debt relief, the country’s external outlook would remain
vulnerable to adverse shocks. Therefore, the authorities fully understand the need, on their part, to
maintain a prudent debt management policy. After amending an important cooperation agreement
aimed at building and modernizing infrastructure, while revitalizing the mining sector, to make it
consistent with program-related concessionality requirements and with debt sustainability, they
recently reiterated their commitment to refrain from contracting or guaranteeing new debt that would
jeopardize debt sustainability. They also plan to improve the business climate and enhance legal
protection for investments, as indicated earlier. Moreover, my DRC authorities maintain close
communication with the Paris Club on the implementation of their economic program, and intend to
request from these creditors rescheduling agreements to alleviate the country’s debt service burden.
They also maintain dialogue with London Club private creditors, with the view to obtain debt
restructuring on comparable terms and plan to normalize relations with all bilateral and commercial
creditors. In turn, the DRC authorities commit to avoid accumulating any new arrears on
nonreschedulable external debt during the program period.
V. Conclusion
As a post-conflict country, the Democratic Republic of the Congo now faces an opportunity to
consolidate peace and political stability as well as make significant advances towards reconstruction,
reducing poverty and meeting the MDGs. As hope is reemerging in DRC, with renewed efforts
towards reconciliation and peace in a context of good regional cooperation, it is critical that the
international community provides financial and technical support to allow the DRC to pursue its
ambitious policy and reform agenda outlined in the authorities’ MEFP and step up development
efforts.
The swift involvement of the Fund in 2002 had been instrumental to the progress made between that
year and late 2005. Fund assistance this time around, through a new PRGF-supported arrangement in
support of the Congolese authorities’ ongoing efforts to maintain macroeconomic stability, will
enable them to mobilize donor support and attract private investors, thereby helping put the country
on a path of robust and sustained growth and lasting poverty reduction. Therefore, my DRC
authorities would greatly appreciate the Executive Board’s support of their requests for a three-year
PRGF arrangement and additional interim assistance under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative.
