At the conclusion of the last consultation in August 2003, Directors commended the
authorities for Ireland’s outstanding economic performance. They emphasized,
however, the need for wage growth to moderate in order to preserve competitiveness
and cautioned there was a significant risk that house prices could be overvalued.
Following several years of procyclical fiscal expansion, Directors welcomed the
consolidation measures envisaged in the 2003 Budget.

Executive Summary
Background and Outlook: Over the last half of the 1990s, incomes in Ireland grew quickly
and converged to the EU average as output and employment expanded. A sound
macroeconomic policy framework encouraged large inflows of FDI that served as a catalyst
to growth. In 2001, growth in Ireland slowed along with the slowing in the world economy.
The downturn, however, was relatively mild, particularly in employment, and the economy
began to recover in 2003. Inflation, which had been running well above that in the euro area
for several years, converged to the average euro area rate in early 2004, although the rate of
house price inflation continues to significantly exceed sustainable rates. Currently, indicators
point to a continued rebound in growth to rates above those in many other industrial
countries, but significantly lower than those experienced in Ireland during the late 1990s.
While fiscal policy appears to have adjusted to slower growth, there are signs that
expectations in other markets may still not have fully adjusted.
Policy discussions focused on the following key issues:
•

What are sustainable medium-term growth rates?

•

To what extent have expectations in product, labor, housing markets and fiscal policy
adjusted to slower growth?

•

Avoiding a procyclical fiscal policy.

There was broad agreement on the diagnostics:
•

Recovery is well underway and growth in 2004 and 2005 will be between 4 percent
and 5 percent, the range that appears to be sustainable over the medium term.

•

Inflation will remain close to the ECB’s target as resource constraints have abated
and the catch-up of the Irish price level to key trading partners appears complete.

•

House-price inflation continues to run well above sustainable rates and the longer it
takes for them to moderate the greater the risk of a disorderly correction.

•

Competitiveness has deteriorated. Although there is little evidence that this has yet
had a significant negative impact, wage moderation going forward will be important
to avoid further deterioration.

The key policy recommendations are:
•

A modest tightening in the structural fiscal balance in the next budget to avoid a
procyclical fiscal policy.

•

The authorities should continue to communicate their views about potential
overheating in the housing market to help achieve a soft landing, and look to
removing the subsidies to housing over the medium-term to help moderate houseprice cycles in the future.

•

Shortening the duration of the wage component of the social partnership agreements
to increase flexibility in nominal wages.

I. BACKGROUND AND KEY ISSUES
1.
Ireland experienced a remarkable economic boom in the 1990s. Output growth
averaged 10 percent a year in 1995–2000 and per capita income rapidly caught up with the
EU average. A salient feature of this “Celtic
Tiger” era was large increases in the proportion

of the population at work (Figure 1). This

reflected both favorable demographic trends
(in percent)
that increased participation rates and a dramatic
decline in unemployment, which fell from a
8
8
16 percent rate in the early 1990s to less than
4 percent by the end of 2000. Employment
growth was facilitated by successive social

pacts that contributed to wage moderation.
Fiscal consolidation during this period, which
reduced the public debt from over 100 percent

raising concerns about a hard landing and
financial system soundness.
2.
In the event, following the global downturn, growth slowed sharply in mid-2001.
The substantial contribution of multinationals to Irish output and associated profit flows
creates significant differences between measures of output, and the recent cycles in GDP and
GNP have not been synchronized (Figure 2). When measured by GNP, which excludes
payments to foreign factors of production and better reflects domestic economic activity,
growth decelerated from around 10 percent in 2000 to 1½ percent in 2002. Household
consumption growth slowed, while business investment collapsed in the aftermath of the

bursting of the global ICT bubble but residential
investment remained robust. The labor market was
relatively resilient to the slowdown (Figure 3).
Cushioned by slower increases in labor force
participation rates, increases in public sector
employment and in part-time work, unemployment
gradually inched up from a low of 3.7 percent in
January 2001 to 4.8 percent by July 2003. Domestic
demand was supported by the ECB’s easing of
monetary policy and an expansionary fiscal policy.
Even as export growth decelerated sharply in 2001–
02, net exports remained a significant positive
contributor to growth as import growth, especially of
capital goods, fell more.
3.
In sync with the global upturn, growth
picked up in 2003. In line with the global recovery
in manufacturing, industrial production rose
steadily over the year, while rising new export
orders saw the PMI rebound strongly in the second
half (Figure 4). Private consumption was supported
by a recovery in consumer confidence from its
trough in the summer and a gradual inching down
of unemployment. The drop off in nonresidential
investment slowed through the year while
residential investment accelerated sharply. Overall
GNP growth was 2.8 percent in 2003.

Ireland has generally responded appropriately to policy challenges identified in
previous Article IV consultations. Fiscal policies were expansionary in 2000–02, contrary
to Fund advice. However, beginning with the 2003 Budget, the authorities took steps
consistent with Fund advice towards consolidating the public finances and the 2004 Budget
has held the line. Furthermore, no new temporary fiscal initiatives have been introduced that
attempt to fine tune the housing market. In contrast to its predecessors, the present social
partnership agreement signed in spring 2003 offered no fiscal concessions, a step in line with
the Fund’s recommendation. The latest agreement on wage increases presents a considerable
degree of wage moderation relative to the past. Financial supervision has and continues to be
strengthened along the lines recommended in the 2000 FSAP. Progress in improving public
expenditure efficiency, controlling public sector wages, and increasing domestic competition
has been more limited.
6.
The relative resilience of activity during the global downturn and the abatement
of inflationary pressures suggest a remarkably soft landing from the boom but there
are significant challenges and risks in managing the transition to slower growth. With
many of the factors accounting for the boom such as the increased employment rate and
productivity catch up being one-off by nature, medium-term growth prospects are decidedly
lower than in the Celtic Tiger era. Indications are that competitiveness has deteriorated
significantly and there are risks from further euro appreciation, while house price increases
continue at a rapid pace and there are risks of an abrupt unwinding. There remain large
infrastructure needs and a strong demand for higher quality public services. Against this
background, this year’s discussions focused on:
•

What are sustainable medium-term growth rates?

•

To what extent have expectations in product, labor, housing markets, and fiscal
policy adjusted to slower growth? Are the risks being factored in?

•

Avoiding a procyclical easing of fiscal policy and achieving value-for-money in
public expenditures.
II. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
A. The Outlook: Recovery to Lower Potential Rates

7.
In the near term, the shared prospect is for the recovery to strengthen and
become more broad-based. Staff’s baseline forecast sees GNP growth picking up to
4½ percent in 2004, with a slightly higher increase in GDP (Table 1). External demand
continues to improve though the euro’s appreciation last year will be a restraining influence.
With consumer confidence recovering, household spending will rise along with disposable
incomes and employment. The recovery in equipment investment is expected to strengthen,
while residential investment could well exceed last year’s vigorous pace. At the time of the
mission, the authorities agreed with the qualitative characterization of improved growth

- 14 -

prospects, and the Department of Finance’s recent update of prospects for 2004 is largely in
line with staff’s forecasts.
8.
There is broad agreement on the overall prospects for 2005. Staff forecasts GNP
growth to rise to 5 percent in 2005 and the authorities acknowledged that their latest official
projections of around 4 percent, made at the time of the budget in December 2003, would
need to be revised. The outlook reflects the balance of countervailing forces. The widely held
expectation is that residential investment should at least decelerate from its extraordinary
pace. External demand is projected to also slow as excess capacity in the world economy gets
utilized and growth falls to trend rates. Household spending will be supported by increasing
incomes and a tightening labor market but a key issue is the extent to which consumption
will be restrained by higher debt-servicing costs as interest rates begin to normalize, with the
staff emphasizing the implications of the rapid run up in household debt levels. Equipment
investment is expected to rebound strongly from substantially depressed levels.
9.
The shared outlook is for inflation to remain moderate. Barring major exchange
rate changes, staff sees underlying or “core” inflation remaining in the vicinity of 2 percent
on a HICP basis, though headline rates will be buffeted by oil prices, while the authorities
saw a somewhat higher average rate. From a cyclical viewpoint, staff estimates that the build
up of slack during the slowdown was limited and is dissipated under the baseline by next
year with little implication for inflation. While sharing the assessment of slack as being
limited, the authorities saw faster prospective tightening in the labor market and saw greater
potential for wage inflation picking up. From a secular viewpoint, there was agreement that
the “catch up” of the Irish price level to other developed countries appears complete and
should not be a factor.
10.
While the risks to the near-term growth outlook are broadly balanced, further
out the staff sees the risks as being on the downside. In the near term, downside risks to
external demand from the euro area are offset by upside risks elsewhere, particularly the UK.
Looking ahead, significant further euro appreciation in response to global imbalances
presents an important downside risk. Staff emphasized and the authorities acknowledged the
risks to growth from the potential unwinding of the spectacular booms in house prices and
construction (see Section II. C below). On inflation, the slow adjustment of expectations to
lower productivity growth and inflation prospects and the potential feed-through of oil price
increases to wages and services inflation tilts the risks
to the upside.
Output per hour (US = 100)

11.
There is strong agreement that mediumterm growth prospects are decidedly lower than
they were in the second half of the 1990s. Many of
the factors that accounted for the 1990s boom are best
thought of as raising the level rather than the growth
rate of output. Using a growth accounting framework
that embodies a tapering off in productivity catch up
and labor force participation rates, staff estimates
medium-term potential GNP growth to be at the mid-

point of the typically cited range of 4–5 percent.1 Such rates are less than half the average

estimates of potential growth obtained
from the methodology agreed between EU countries and the European Commission. This
methodology currently yields estimates of current potential growth that are significantly
above the 4–5 percent range reflecting the weight given by the filtering techniques employed
to the boom period. The authorities did not disagree with staff views that the methodology
likely overstated potential growth over the medium term and they noted that conditions in the
labor market suggested that there was only limited slack in the economy presently.
B. Competitiveness and Incomes Policy Requirements
12.
The rapid reduction and convergence of
inflation is encouraging, but concerns about the
erosion of competitiveness have grown. On a number
of measures, competitiveness has eroded significantly.
With the strengthening of the euro during 2002–03, the
nominal effective exchange rate has now essentially
reverted to its level during the relatively stable 1995–
98 period. However, with inflation rates persistently in
excess of those in partner countries for six years,
Ireland’s price level has risen well above those in its
main trading partners and the consumer-price-based
real exchange rate now stands some 15 percent above
its level during 1995–98.

Staff estimates a deterioration in the competitiveness of the manufacturing
sector of a similar order. The traditional output-weighted real exchange rate for
manufacturing suggests only a pause in the rate of trend real depreciation, but this measure is
not representative of broad competitiveness developments in the sector. As is now widely
recognized, aggregate manufacturing measures for Ireland are distorted by the presence of a
handful of sectors dominated by multinationals with limited employment whose gains in
productivity often represent returns from intangible foreign inputs into production such as

returns on past R&D, patents and advertising campaigns abroad.2 In contrast, the more
relevant employment-weighted real exchange rate index for manufacturing has appreciated
by some 15 percent over 1995–98 levels. This deterioration has reflected entirely increases in
wages in excess of those in productivity since the slowdown began in 2001.

Encouraging recent export and FDI performance has allayed concerns in some
quarters about the losses in competitiveness, but staff and the authorities agreed that
risks remain. First, the authorities indicated that the muted effects of declines in
competitiveness in part reflect a willingness on the part of firms to temporarily absorb
declines in profit margins and a lagged adverse response of output and employment could be
forthcoming. Second, erosions in competitiveness increase the speed with which the
composition of FDI flows needs to move to higher value added activities. Here a proactive
industrial policy has been effective in facilitating such a shift but the necessary upgrading of
skills will have to keep pace. The loss of indigenous industries also increases the reliance on
the modern and inherently more mobile high-technology sector. Third, high rates of services
inflation may deter labor supply as suggested by the recent slowdown in female labor force
participation rates as childcare costs rose. Finally, there is anecdotal evidence of high relative
house prices deterring inward migration.

line with lower prospective core inflation and productivity developments. There was
agreement that with wages in Ireland now amongst the highest in the world, there is a strong
case for these agreements not to be exceeded as they often have been in the past.
16.
The three-year national wage agreements have served Ireland well but the
tradeoff between greater wage flexibility and the costs of renegotiation is likely to shift.3
The recent trend of not relying on granting fiscal concessions within the social partnership to
facilitate agreement has been welcome and there is agreement that both the scope for offering
further concessions and their potential benefits were now limited. The present three-year
agreement is the first to have broken up the wage negotiations into two sub-periods. This
change was agreed by the social partners at the time on the grounds of the prevailing
economic uncertainty following the Iraq conflict. Staff argued for its maintenance going
forward on the grounds of the benefits of greater flexibility in wages in the face of a limited
potential for persistent upside surprises in growth than had been the case in the late 1990s.
While recognizing the importance of increasing wage flexibility within the social partnership
framework, the authorities noted the significant logistical and practical difficulties associated
with more frequent negotiations, and the heavy burden this would place on the social
partnership process.

that progress on the reviews of the remaining six professions has been slow and that steps
toward improving efficiency in public transportation have been met with resistance by public
sector unions. Overall, results appear to have been limited and the scope for hastening
progress in these areas seems considerable.
C. Continued Ebullience in the Housing Market
18.
Rapidly rising property prices in the face of slow growth have been a feature in
many countries recently, but the extent, scale and duration of the boom in Ireland set it
apart. There is agreement that there are many fundamental reasons for why the boom in
Ireland should have been bigger: the enormous increases in disposable incomes and
employment during the Celtic Tiger era, demographic factors, the change in direction of
migration flows, lower and less volatile interest rates following EMU, and financial
liberalization and innovation that increased the supply of lending. In addition, the authorities
emphasized the strong preference in Ireland for owning property as a factor. The dynamics of
house prices have also been affected by tax changes, such as the re-introduction of interest
tax deductibility for residential investment mortgages in the 2002 budget. Accompanying the
house price boom have been record increases in mortgage credit, which reached a pace of
27 percent recently and household debt has risen to 100 percent of after-tax income, up from
60 percent in 1998. On the supply side, an enormous response has been forthcoming. Last
year, some 69 thousand new homes were built, representing 17 new houses per thousand of
the population, as compared to 6 in the US, less than 5 in Europe, and less than 3 in the UK.

The question remains whether the house price increases to date have outstripped
developments in fundamentals. During last year’s consultation, the staff presented
empirical evidence suggesting price increases had exceeded those that would have been
suggested by developments in traditional demand-side factors (disposable incomes,

- 19 -

demographics and interest rates).4 The authorities noted that a number of observers have
since argued that adding supply-side factors, measured in particular by the price of building
land, building costs and the availability of mortgage loans, sufficiently explain house price
developments.5 The staff, while sympathetic to the

suggested by fundamentals, particularly in light of
the massive increases in supply seen recently. This view is reinforced by a variety of other
indicators: some 40 percent of new houses are being purchased as second or buy-to-let
properties;6 buy-to-let transactions account for 20 percent of all new mortgages; and building
has accelerated despite rents and the rental yield on new construction falling sharply.
20.
There is greater agreement that recent rates of price increase are running above
sustainable rates dictated by medium-term growth prospects and the longer they fail to
moderate the greater the vulnerability to a possibly disorderly correction. The staff
argued that because real estate represents an asset price whose valuation depends not only on
current but also on future demand and supply conditions, future income growth is an
appropriate benchmark against which to gauge the sustainability of price developments.7
Recent rates of house price increase of 12–15 percent are out of line with medium-term
income-growth prospects of 4–5 percent in real, and 6–7 percent in nominal terms. There was
agreement that the predominance of mortgages at variable rates and significantly increased
household debt levels made the housing market in Ireland vulnerable to sharp increases in

interest rates, though market expectations of the monetary policy tightening cycle in the euro
area are for moderate and gradual increases.
21.
In the near term, public communication can play an important role in taming
expectations and help induce a soft landing in the housing market but over the mediumterm structural aspects of the housing market must be addressed. The staff strongly
supports the Central Bank’s public expressions of concern regarding recent rates of house
price increase and credit growth. Beyond the present conjuncture, the staff argued that policy
needs to confront the basic issue that the oft-cited strong preference for home ownership and
asset-of-choice for saving in Ireland is an argument against subsidizing housing as such
incentives exacerbate price movements when ability-to-buy rises. There is thus a strong case
for removing the interest-deductibility of mortgage payments on primary dwellings and for
introducing a market-value-based wealth tax on property. Although second homes are not
subsidized, they are not taxed either and, given the still scarce infrastructure being provided
to these homes, there is a good argument that they should be. The authorities noted the
political, likely insurmountable, difficulties of removing interest-deductibility of mortgages
or introducing taxation on property given the electorate’s long history of strong attachment
to, and preference for owning, property.
22.
High profitability and capitalization levels have bolstered the capacity of the
domestic banking system to withstand shocks without creating systemic stress.
Following rapid increases in lending, the property sector now represents about half of banks’
loan books (residential mortgages 34 percent; commercial property 12 percent; and
construction 4 percent). The authorities noted that the results of stress tests indicated that
strong capitalization levels provided a significant cushion for absorbing sharp declines in
property prices with simultaneous increases in unemployment and interest rates, a view
shared by the rating agencies. The authorities and private banks also noted that low effective
loan-to-value ratios meant that prices would have to fall considerably before negative equity
considerations came into play and there is a strong culture of servicing mortgages in Ireland,
as evidenced by the low (1 to 20 basis points) rates of bad or nonperforming mortgages
despite the recent growth slowdown. Nearer term, the staff welcomed strengthened
surveillance by the supervisory authority to ensure that sufficient account is taken of
prudential concerns in banks’ lending behavior. Staff argued that greater attention needs be
paid to factoring in the effects of the normalization of interest rates from their present
cyclical lows and efforts made to increase borrower awareness of the prospects for interest
rates and their impact on debt servicing costs.
23.
A sharp correction in the housing market could have macroeconomic
consequences, although financial stability is likely not a concern. The authorities noted
that while increases in house prices have undoubtedly increased the perceived wealth of
homeowners, unlike in some other countries, mortgage equity withdrawals are not prevalent
in Ireland. There has not been a strong identifiable relationship between aggregate
consumption and house prices either, with the former following more closely developments
in disposable income. Thus there is reason to doubt that a correction in house prices would
directly slow consumption appreciably. The authorities acknowledged though that such a

- 21 -

correction could harm consumer confidence. The authorities stressed that the more relevant
channel for a potential impact was through unemployment with coincident large increases in
interest rates being the scenario of greatest

during the recent downturn which suggested

that labor shed by the construction sector
could be absorbed quickly elsewhere in the economy. The staff was more agnostic, noting
that the construction boom had been ongoing prior to the slowdown and gathered momentum
during the downturn spurred by lower interest rates and tax changes, while increases in
public employment had also helped mitigate the effects on unemployment. It is not clear
whether a significant autonomous increase in unemployment in the non-traded sector could
be absorbed by the traded sector as easily since there was certainly no reason to expect a
coincident upswing there and skill-matching would likely be an issue.

The 2004 Budget continued the pattern of holding expenditure growth down in
line with lower revenue and economic growth but revenue outturns so far have again
exceeded expectations. The budget, framed

capital expenditures will continue to be broadly
in line with the budget. These developments have prompted staff to revise its projections to a
nominal fiscal deficit of ⅓ percent of GDP this year. Excluding one-off effects, the staff
projects a structural or underlying deficit this year of about ½ percent of GDP (Table 5).
26.
The staff argued that cyclical considerations presented a strong case for
beginning the required modest longer-run fiscal tightening in the next budget. The
authorities emphasized their commitment to the SGP, including achieving a zero structural
balance over the medium term, which the staff fully supports. The projected structural
balances in the 2004 Stability Program are in

the staff argued there was a strong case for
beginning adjustment in the next budget. From
a longer perspective, fiscal policy should be well placed to deal with the pressures from
aging. The build-up of assets in the National Pension Reserve Fund (annual contribution of 1
percent of GNP) will help alleviate the budgetary cost of aging. Also, Ireland is in a
comparatively good position to meet these costs given the high degree of pension funding
and the relatively low tax burden.

But political pressures to reduce taxes or spend the recent improvements in the
public finances are likely to grow, especially in the event of upside surprises to growth,
and staff called for an overall multi-year spending framework. There was agreement that
any loosening of fiscal policy at this juncture would be procyclical, with deleterious effects
on inflation, value for money in government expenditures and competitiveness. In line with
the staff’s calls in the past, the
authorities extended the use of

that these be extended to
encompass current spending. The
authorities viewed the need for expectations to adjust completely to the lower medium-term
growth prospects as a necessary precondition for adopting medium-term spending envelopes
well-aligned to perspective resource growth.
28.
The mission agreed with the authorities’ view that meeting the demand for
higher quality public services and infrastructure does not require higher taxes and
spending. The size of

capital spending, at the targeted 5 percent of GNP, is well above levels elsewhere. Faster
increases risk running up against bottlenecks and serious inefficiencies, as in the late 1990s
when spending exceeded this level, leading to double digit rates of associated price inflation.
29.
Providing higher quality public services requires improving the value for money
in public expenditures. Popular dissatisfaction with the quality of public services in health,
education and infrastructure runs high despite

accountability and rationalize service provision,
and the program for the modernization of public service delivery. Staff argued for shifting
the focus in public services delivery from inputs to outputs. In particular, an emphasis on
quantified performance targets would motivate efficiency gains, while demonstrable
improvements in the quality of public services will be necessary over time to reduce
pressures for additional spending increases, arguing for better monitoring and measurement
of public outputs.
E. Other Issues
30.
Ireland’s statistics are being improved to meet international requirements. Staff
welcomed the newly-introduced data on external debt and stressed the need to improve fiscal
reporting at the general government level and to publish a national earnings index as well as
sectoral balance sheets. The authorities are extending the scope and consistency of earnings
data and compiling sectoral balance sheets, which should be completed by 2005.
31.
Ireland has been a strong supporter of trade liberalization in the context of the
EU. On the CAP, however, the authorities noted that having agreed to two reforms in
preparation for the WTO they were unlikely to agree to further reforms. They noted that the
priority is to ensure a balanced agreement in agriculture across the three pillars of domestic
support, market access and export subsidies. They feel agriculture is one element of the
negotiation of a new WTO round that should not be sacrificed as the price for an overall
agreement.

- 25 -

32.
The authorities remain committed to reaching the UN target of 0.7 percent of
GNP for official development assistance (ODA) by 2007. As in 2003, ODA is budgeted at
0.4 percent of GNP in 2004.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
33.
In the face of substantial global shocks over the last few years, the economic
performance of Ireland has been enviable. Despite being one of the most open economies
in the world, growth proved remarkably resilient to the global downturn. Contrary to
concerns, flexibility in the labor market limited increases in unemployment. After running
well above trading partner country rates for several years, aided by the euro’s appreciation,
inflation slowed rapidly, converging to euro area rates.
34.
The near-term prospect is for stronger and broader-based growth and for
inflation to remain moderate. Growth will be supported by external demand and a
continued rebound in business investment but private consumption will be restrained by
increases in debt servicing costs as interest rates begin to normalize and residential
investment should slow from unusually high rates. Underlying or core inflation should
remain in the vicinity of 2 percent though headline rates will be buffeted by oil prices. The
potential for further euro appreciation in response to global imbalances and an abrupt
unwinding of the housing boom represent key risks to the outlook.
35.
Medium-term growth prospects are markedly lower than experienced in the
second half of the 1990s. Many of the one-off factors that accounted for the 1990s boom
have raised the level of output rather than imparted a lasting influence on growth prospects
and staff forecasts medium-term growth of 4½ percent in GNP. Such rates remain amongst
the highest in the world but are less than half the average experienced in 1995–2000.
36.
The key challenge for both the private and public sectors is managing the
transition, in particular of expectations, to slower growth. Indeed, the external downturn
helped initiate a necessary adjustment of expectations and policies to lower growth.
However, with medium-term growth prospects significantly lower and the economy not
operating far from potential, it is important that these adjustments be viewed as required for
longer-term structural reasons rather than as having been necessary for cyclical reasons only.
From this vantage point, there are varying degrees of concern about the adjustments to date
across sectors.
37.
Safeguarding competitiveness must be a key priority of economic policy and the
social partnership. In goods and labor markets, the deceleration of inflation indicates
expectations have been adjusting but the lagged response means the level of competitiveness
has deteriorated significantly. Wage and goods-price inflation rates persistently in excess of
those in partner countries represented in part a warranted catch-up as incomes and
productivity rose. This process has to, however, be near completion if it has not already
overshot. Ireland’s price level has risen well above that in its main trading partners and
wages are now amongst the highest in the world. The wage increase negotiated recently by

- 26 -

the social partnership is in line with prospective core inflation and productivity
developments. It does not, however, take into account past erosions in the level of
competitiveness or the risks of further euro appreciation. An extended period of wage
restraint is therefore warranted. The desirability of increased wage flexibility also provides a
case for shortening the duration of national wage agreements from three years. The costs of
more frequent negotiations can be reduced by separating wider social partnership issues from
the wage negotiation process.
38.
At this conjuncture, public policy should aim to engineer a soft landing in the
housing market, but over the medium-term reforms will need to improve the stability of
the sector. As house price increases continue to exceed reasonable prospects for mediumterm growth, the Central Bank’s communications to tame expectations in both the credit and
housing markets are appropriate and welcome. In the event of an abrupt unwinding of the
housing market boom, though financial stability is likely not a concern, there is a likelihood
of a protracted slowdown in private consumption. With variable rate mortgages predominant
and household debt levels having risen, more can and should be done to increase borrower
and lender awareness of the prospects for interest rate increases from current cyclical lows
and their implications for debt-servicing costs. The strong preference in Ireland for owning
property is a compelling reason for not providing additional incentives in the form of
subsidies to home ownership. Removing the interest-deductibility of mortgage payments on
primary dwellings and introducing a market-value-based wealth tax on property is therefore
important. Given still scarce infrastructure, second homes should be taxed at higher rates.
39.
Fiscal policy has adjusted well to slower medium-term growth prospects, but
cyclical considerations argue for frontloading the remaining necessary longer-run
consolidation. The 2003 Budget began the process of adjusting to the new growth realities
and the 2004 Budget has held the line, with planned expenditure growth within typical ranges
of medium-term potential nominal GDP growth. The overall outturn for 2003 and early
returns in 2004 have exceeded expectations, but this reflects in part windfall receipts from
changes in the capital-gains tax regime and successes with anti-fraud measures, as well as
higher-than-expected revenues from the buoyancy of the property market. Excluding these
one-off effects, there is an underlying deficit in 2004 of ½ percent of GDP. With limited
slack in the economy and growth picking up, the required adjustment to the medium-term
objective of balance should begin in Budget 2005. Political pressures to spend the
improvement in the public finances should be resisted as such an easing would be
procyclical, raise inflation, hurt competitiveness, and limit the value for money from such
expenditures.
40.
Concerns about the level and quality of public services and infrastructure in
Ireland should be addressed by improving delivery rather than by raising taxes and
expenditures. At its present levels of 5 percent of GNP, government capital spending is well
above levels elsewhere, and faster increases would risk running up against bottlenecks and
inefficiencies. The introduction of multi-year spending envelopes for department’s public
capital spending is particularly welcome because it should safeguard such spending from
procyclical pressures, improve planning and predictability, and encourage efficiency. There

- 27 -

is a strong case for extending such envelopes speedily to encompass current spending. The
fundamental reforms begun in the health sector and the modernization of public service
delivery hold promise. There should be a shift in focus across public services from inputs to
outputs.
41.
Scope remains for improving the provision of statistics. Ensuring the timeliness of
general government accounts and developing a national earnings index should be priorities.
42.
The authorities should adopt a more supportive stance within the EU in favor of
further CAP reform, particularly in view of the adverse impact of this policy on developing
countries and EU consumers. This would complement the welcome commitment towards
achieving the UN’s ODA target by 2007.
43.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month
cycle.

1/ Based on current policies. The staff estimates assume that tax revenues will perform according to the latest SP projections
in 2005–06, but are adjusted for the difference between the government's and staff's growth assumptions. From 2007 onwards,
tax revenues (excluding indirect taxes) are projected using the OECD's estimates of tax elasticities. Expenditure
estimates for 2004 are based on the latest available official information, whereas projections for 2005–06 assume
expenditure to increase at the pace envisaged in the SP (except for interest rate expenditure). Due to different
accounting conventions, the staff's estimates of total revenue and expenditure ratios differ from the Stability Programme.

APPENDIX II

Sustainability Exercise
Fiscal Sustainability
The sustainability of Ireland’s fiscal position was assessed under alternative scenarios regarding
key macroeconomic and fiscal assumptions, as well as several bound tests (Table A1). In the
baseline, gross general government debt declines gradually from about 34 percent in 2003 to
slightly below 31 percent in 2009. This occurs despite continued increases in assets, such as
those accumulated in government pension and social security funds.8 The primary balance
remains in surplus during the period, leading to a favorable medium-term fiscal outlook.
The alternative scenarios and bound tests show that Ireland’s medium-term fiscal debt position is
resilient to a variety of shocks (see panels A and B of Table A1). The worst outcome—a rise in
the debt ratio from 32½ percent in 2004 to around 40 percent in 2009—is achieved under the
assumption that there is a 10 percent of GDP increase in other debt-creating flows in 2005.
External Sustainability
With a net external position (excluding direct investment) showing substantial claims on the rest
of the world (around 90 percent of GDP), external debt sustainability does not seem to be an
issue (Table A2). The net external position, including direct investment, is in a relatively small
deficit given the very strong continued FDI inflows into Ireland. The fact that Ireland is a net
creditor with regard to portfolio suggests little vulnerability to interest rate shocks or to a sudden
reversal in short-term capital flows. The large gross assets and liabilities in portfolio and other
investments reflect the activities of the International Financial Service Center, which the 2000
FSAP noted does not appear to pose a systemic risk to the domestic financial system.

Statistical Issues
Ireland is subject to the statistical requirements and timeliness and reporting standards of the
Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB). Ireland has cooperated fully with the Fund
in providing monetary, international reserves, and selected other financial statistics related to
its membership in the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). These data are
considered comprehensive, reliable, timely, and well documented. Ireland has subscribed to
the Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS).
1.
Quarterly national accounts on an ESA 1995 basis have been introduced and are
currently published within 4 months of its reference period. Real sector data are sometimes
published with a lag of 3–6 months, while some non-SDDS series are published with a lag of
one and a half years (e.g., household disposable income). Lags are particularly long (3–
7 months) for employment, earnings, unit wage costs, and national income and expenditure
data. Ireland does not have an overall earnings index or comprehensive sectoral balance
sheet data.
2.
While the authorities publish Exchequer returns on a monthly and quarterly basis,
only annual data on the general government balance are currently available.

Statement by Charles X. O’Loghlin, Alternate Executive Director for Ireland
October 29, 2004

Key Points
•

My authorities broadly share the analysis and conclusions of the well-balanced Staff
Report.

•

The Irish economy has proved remarkably resilient to the global downturn, with
growth well above the EU average through 2002/03 and strengthening more recently.

•

To sustain this performance going forward, my authorities:
o agree that safeguarding competitiveness is essential;
o are committed to managing public expenditure within the overall constraint of
growth in current resources, and welcome the staff assessment that fiscal policy
has adjusted to slower medium-term growth prospects; and
o are alive to the potential implications of strong house-price and household
credit growth.

•

My authorities agree that the medium-term growth potential of the economy – with
continuing economy-wide commitment to sound policies – is in the 4-5 percent range
and note that, in the context of prospective population growth, this suggests annual per
capita growth potential in the 3-3 ½ percent range.

My authorities thank the staff for this year’s positive Article IV discussions and Report…
1. At the outset, my authorities wish to thank the staff for the conciseness and sharp focus of
this year’s Article IV discussions – mirrored in their Report and in the accompanying
Selected Issues document. They broadly share the analysis and conclusions of the
well-balanced Staff Report.
Policy has generally paralleled past Fund advice…
2. In common with many Article IV Reports this year, the staff provides an assessment of
the consistency of policy with their past advice. The considerations which underlay their
recommendations in Reports over the past year or two were also foremost in the minds of
Irish policy-makers as global and domestic growth faltered. It is, therefore, no surprise
that policy developments over recent times, as indicated in Paragraph 7 of the Report,
largely coincided with those recommendations.
Near-term economic prospects are encouraging…
3. Economic performance through this year has been significantly exceeding our
expectations as 2004 began. My authorities now anticipate full-year GDP growth of the
order of 4¾ percent (GNP 4¼ percent). A balanced budget is foreseen, rather than the
1.1 percent of GDP fiscal deficit initially forecast, underpinning a further fall in Ireland’s
already-low debt ratio. Despite some strengthening in personal consumption and the

-2significant imports associated with recovering machinery and equipment investment –
adding further to Irish output capacity – the balance on our external current account is
expected to show little change, with exports picking up in line with growth in world
trade. Overall, the Irish economy has proved remarkably resilient to the global
downturn, with growth remaining well above the corresponding EU averages
through 2002/03 and strengthening more recently.
Aided by a continuing focus on competitiveness and bringing inflation down…
4. Indications are that employment will expand by about 2 percent through 2004. Despite
this, unemployment is expected to ease only slightly from last year’s level of 4.6 percent,
reflecting ongoing net inward migration and – encouragingly – further increases in labor
force participation. Still more encouraging, this progress is taking place in the context of
a significant easing of EU-HICP-measured inflation, which should average about 2¼
percent this year – not far from the prospective euro area average for 2004. I might add
that this improvement does not reflect (budget-damaging) easing of indirect taxes: net
excise changes in Budget 2004 broadly approximated consumer price inflation. Instead,
ongoing efforts to enhance competition in domestic markets and the wage provisions of
the current social partnership agreement are key factors in the moderating pace of
domestic cost increases, with the appreciating euro also playing a role.
My authorities agree that safeguarding competitiveness is essential going forward…
5. The staff provides an interesting assessment of competitive developments in the
manufacturing sector. My authorities do not demur from its thrust – the strong output
growth per labor-hour in a few technologically modern sectors1 needs to be carefully
interpreted in assessing manufacturing, or economy-wide, competitiveness. Different
approaches to discounting this effect will offer differing assessments of competitiveness
trends. However, my authorities would agree that all reasonable interpretations point to
competitive loss over recent times.
Through a strong focus on cost developments…
6. They fully accept that Ireland cannot afford to worsen an already-deteriorated
competitive position. This was a key focus of discussions on the current social
partnership agreement – the outcome of which, as the staff note, “is in line with
prospective core inflation and productivity developments”. My authorities are insistent
that, as a minimum, wage increases must be limited to those recently negotiated; and that
regaining lost competitiveness must be a key priority of economic policy and of Social
Partnership going forward. As to the suggestion to (permanently) move to shorter1

Measured labor productivity growth in these sectors reflects both (a) increases in labor efficiency in existing
businesses and (b) the “birth” of new, more capital-intensive and higher-labor-productivity, businesses. Many
of the latter reflect FDI flows – notably from the US – pushing measured labor productivity in those sectors
towards US levels [e.g. O’Mahony & van Ark, quoted by the staff, report labor productivity in Ireland in Office
Machinery and Electronic valves etc. at 40-60 percent above EU averages, but 10-20 percent below US levels,
in 2001]. An employment-weighted interpretation of output-per-labor-hour largely adjusts for this effect – and
takes substantial account, also, of developments in capital intensity [the US Bureau of Economic Analysis
reports that total assets employed per worker in Irish-based (non-banking) affiliates of US entities in 2002 were
2¾ times the level of assets per person employed in the average EU15-based affiliate].

-3duration wage components in social partnership agreements2, they recognize the merits of
achieving greater wage flexibility but also note the significant logistical and practical
difficulties associated with more frequent negotiations, and the heavy burden this would
place on the social partnership process.
And on enhancing competitive forces, in particular to bear down on services costs…
7. My authorities’ ongoing efforts to enhance competition in product and services markets
aim in the same direction. With a few exceptions, product markets are exposed to strong
competition – given Ireland’s openness to imports: the exceptions are being narrowed
gradually, not least under the aegis EU-wide deregulation of utilities markets. The focus
of domestic effort, therefore, is on markets for “non-traded” services. These efforts are
being given strong impetus by a growing public realization that Irish prices have caught
up with, and passed, EU averages – an awareness bolstered by the ease with which
individual and overall price levels can be contrasted in a common currency area.
Supported by a fiscal policy consistent with slower medium-term growth prospects…
8. The staff notes that the size of government in Ireland is not small in comparison with
other OECD countries. My authorities agree that concerns about the level and quality of
public services and infrastructure should be addressed by improving the efficiency and
effectiveness of delivery rather than by raising tax and expenditure ratios. Apart from
contributing to public welfare in the shorter run, they view this approach, also, as a
crucial element in fully realizing Irish growth potential. They are committed to
managing public expenditure within the overall constraint of growth in current
resources, and welcome the staff assessment that fiscal policy has adjusted to slower
medium-term growth prospects.
And a strong financial sector...
9. Ireland’s sustained strong expansion of the past decade is testament to a robust, capable
domestic banking system which, given continuing good health, is well-placed to support
future economic expansion. In the light of rapid house-price and private sector credit
growth, it is appropriate to stress the staff conclusion that, even “in the event of an
abrupt unwinding of Ireland’s housing market boom, financial stability is likely not
a concern”. This parallels the view of our Central Bank and Financial Services
Authority. At the launch of its recently-published “Financial Stability Report, 2004”, my
authorities noted that – based on extensive stress-testing – the shock-absorption capacity
of the banking system is currently adequate, even in the face of a sudden and
unanticipated fall in residential property prices accompanied by an increase in default
rates. The capacity of the domestic banking system to withstand shocks without systemic
stress, were they to arise, is bolstered by high profitability and strong capitalization. As
to the risks of such an eventuality, the analyses reported by the staff give mixed signals
2

My authorities note (with respect to page 51 of “Selected Issues”) that the excess in actual pay changes over
the wage terms of the various social partnership Agreements is attributable, in part, to the impact on average
earnings of structural change – the replacement of lower-productivity employment by higher-productivity, thus
higher-paying, jobs – rather than “slippage” versus the pay terms of those Agreements. It is difficult, however,
to satisfactorily measure the extent of this effect.

-4on the question whether, and if so to what extent, house prices are overvalued relative to
“the fundamentals”. What is more certain in my authorities’ view, however – as also
suggested by the staff – is that if house prices were to continue to increase at the doubledigit pace of recent times, the risk of a sharp correction would become more pronounced.
10. My authorities are not complacent. Work to strengthen the effectiveness of financial
sector supervision continues apace (assisted by the recommendations of the 1999/2000
FSAP – which, it has been agreed with the Fund, will be revisited in the coming year).
Likewise, efforts are ongoing to heighten the awareness of all economic agents –
including mortgagors and mortgagees – of the potential implications of rising household
indebtedness, especially in the context of the prevailing low interest rate environment.
My authorities fully agree with the staff that “public communication can play an
important role in taming expectations and help to induce a soft landing in the housing
market”.
Given these, the staff estimate of “potential growth after the boom” seems realistic…
11. Like the staff, my authorities have no illusions that Irish growth over the years ahead
could sustainably emulate the unprecedented expansion of the 1990s. Several factors
which contributed greatly to the “Celtic Tiger” performance cannot repeat in the future
(certainly, at nowhere near the same pace, nor to anything like the same extent). No
significant contribution to growth can be expected from further reducing unemployment,
which is now around 4½ percent. The spectacular gains in labor force participation of
recent years mean that space for future gains, while there, is far less than a decade ago.
They also recognize that the prospective reversal of the hitherto declining trend in overall
dependency – which allowed living standards to rise more rapidly than income-perperson-at-work during the “tiger” years – will slow per capita economic growth. My
authorities, therefore, agree that medium-term growth potential – with continuing
economy-wide commitment to sound policies – is in the 4-5 percent range and that,
in the context of prospective population growth, this points to annual per capita
growth potential in the 3-3 ½ percent range.

IMF Concludes 2004 Article IV Consultation with Ireland
On October 29, 2004, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Ireland.1
Background
Over the last half of the 1990s, incomes in Ireland converged quickly to the EU average owing
to sustained expansions in output and employment. In the 1995–2000 period, growth averaged
10 percent a year while unemployment declined from almost 13 percent to below 4 percent.
The fiscal position also strengthened considerably and the ratio of government debt to GDP fell
from over 80 percent in 1995 to less than 40 percent in 2000. Strong export performance kept
the current account in surplus or close to balance. Toward the end of the boom period, resource
constraints tightened sharply and inflation accelerated to a peak of 6 percent in 2000.
In 2001, growth slowed sharply following the global downturn. Growth in GNP, which best
reflects domestic economic activity because it excludes multinational profit flows, fell from
10 percent in 2000 to 1½ percent in 2002. While goods market activity slowed considerably,
unemployment rose modestly to a peak of 4.8 percent in mid-2003. Inflation, although
moderating slightly from its peak, remained well above the euro area average during the
slowdown.
In 2003, the economy rebounded with GNP growing by almost 3 percent. Recent indicators
suggest that activity has continued to strengthen in 2004. During 2003, inflation decelerated and

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive Board as expressed during
the October 29, 2004 Executive Board discussion based on the staff report.

-2is now close to the euro area average. Most recently, however, oil price increases have led to a
mild pickup in inflation.
Monetary conditions have been accommodative for a sustained period as nominal interest rates
declined considerably in the run-up to EMU. Further, with inflation in Ireland exceeding the euro
area average until just recently, real interest rates declined even more. Low interest rates and
financial market liberalization have resulted in a rapid expansion in household credit which
combined with rapid growth in disposable incomes fuelled a boom in the housing market. Real
house prices have risen by 187 percent since 1995.
The rapid economic expansion of the late 1990s increased fiscal revenues sufficiently to allow
for substantial budget surpluses in spite of significant expenditure increases and tax cuts.
Expenditure increases, however, failed to moderate as growth slowed in 2001 and the fiscal
balanced slipped into deficit by 2002. In 2003, expenditure growth was lowered considerably
and indirect taxes were increased, leading to a surplus of 0.2 percent of GDP.
Going forward, staff project that the economic recovery will gain momentum with GNP growth of
4½ percent in 2004 accelerating slightly to 5 percent in 2005. Core inflation is forecast to stay
close to 2 percent. Although monetary conditions are expected to continue to be supportive, it is
anticipated that interest rates will increase toward more normal levels as the global recovery
firms. Over the medium term, real growth is expected to be in the 4 to 5 percent range.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the continued impressive performance of Ireland’s economy,
which is based on sound economic policies, providing useful lessons for other countries. Growth
remained remarkably resilient in the face of substantial global shocks over the last few years.
Flexibility in the labor market limited increases in unemployment, and inflation slowed rapidly,
converging to euro area rates, after running well above trading partner country rates for several
years. Looking ahead, as medium-term growth prospects are expected to be less buoyant than
during the Celtic Tiger era of the 1990s, the key challenge for Ireland will be to manage the
transition to slower growth.
In the near term, Directors expected the economic recovery to become stronger and broadbased, supported by external demand and a continued rebound in business investment. Core
inflation is expected to remain moderate. The main risks to this outlook stem from the potential
for further euro appreciation in response to global imbalances and the possibility of an abrupt
unwinding of the housing boom.
In the medium term, Directors expected growth to be markedly lower than that experienced in
the second half of the 1990s, as many of the factors that accounted for the 1990s boom were
one-off in nature. However, at around 4-5 percent, growth will still remain high by international
standards. The transition to slower growth will require adjustments in expectations in labor and
housing markets, and also in fiscal policy. Directors stressed that while the global downturn
helped initiate such adjustments, these should be viewed as required for longer-term structural
reasons rather than for cyclical reasons only, and clear communications will remain important in
this regard.
Directors concurred that safeguarding competitiveness should be a key priority of Ireland’s
economic policy and social partnership. Although inflation in goods and labor markets has

-3decelerated—suggesting that expectations have adjusted to lower growth—the level of
competitiveness has deteriorated. The outcome of the wage negotiations of the latest round of
the social partnership, in line with prospective core inflation and productivity developments, is
welcome. Nevertheless, Directors noted that the agreed increases do not take into account past
erosions in the level of competitiveness or the risks of further euro appreciation. To address this
potential source of vulnerability, Directors called for an extended period of wage restraint as well
as for increased wage flexibility within the social partnership. This could be achieved by
shortening the duration of national wage agreements from three years. Directors also noted that
improving domestic competition, especially in the services sector, would help to contain input
costs in the export sector.
Directors underscored the importance of achieving a soft landing of the housing market, given
that recent house price increases continue to exceed medium-term growth prospects. While in
the event of an abrupt unwinding of the housing market boom, financial stability would likely not
be a concern, Directors cautioned that the impact of such an unwinding on employment and
private consumption could be significant. They therefore welcomed the central bank’s
communications to curb expectations in credit and housing markets, and encouraged further
efforts to increase borrower and lender awareness of the prospects for interest rate increases
and their implications for debt-servicing costs. Many Directors also viewed the strong
preference in Ireland for owning property as a compelling reason not to provide additional
incentives in the form of subsidies to home ownership. Steps, which the authorities were
advised to consider in a medium-term context, included removing the interest-deductibility of
mortgage payments on primary dwellings, and introducing a market-value-based wealth tax on
property, graduated to tax second homes at higher rates. Directors welcomed the authorities’
continuing efforts to strengthen financial supervision, including by implementing the FSAP
recommendations.
Directors concurred that fiscal policy has adjusted well to slower medium-term prospects.
To avoid a procyclical fiscal policy, they called for a modest, front-loaded tightening in the
structural fiscal balance in the next budget, in line with the authorities’ commitment to achieve a
structural balance over the medium term. Although the overall outturn for 2003 and early returns
in 2004 have been better than expected, Directors noted that this performance is in part due to
one-off receipts from changes in the capital-gains tax regime and successes with anti-fraud
measures, and the buoyancy of the property market. It will therefore be important to resist
political pressures for increased spending as a result of this improvement in public finances, as
such an easing would be procyclical, raise inflation, hurt competitiveness, and limit value for
money.
Directors shared the authorities’ view that concerns about the level and quality of public
services and infrastructure should be addressed by improving delivery rather than by raising tax
and expenditure ratios. Directors welcomed the introduction of multi-year spending envelopes
for departments’ public capital spending. Ireland’s government capital spending of 5 percent of
GNP is already high by international standards and further increases would risk running up
against bottlenecks and inefficiencies. The new framework should safeguard capital spending
from procyclical pressures, improve planning and predictability, and encourage efficiency. Given
these potential benefits, most Directors saw merit in extending the multi-year spending
envelopes to cover current expenditures, as well. Directors supported the fundamental reforms
begun in the health sector and the modernization of public service delivery, and encouraged a
shift in focus across public services from inputs to outputs. They welcomed the ongoing efforts
to strengthen budget controls and monitoring and to improve management and appraisal of

-4capital projects. Directors considered Ireland well-placed to deal with the impact of population
ageing, through both its sound fiscal position and the high degree of pension funding.
While commending the authorities’ support of multilateral trade liberalization, Directors
encouraged Ireland to adopt a more supportive stance within the EU in favor of further reform of
the Common Agricultural Policy. They welcomed the authorities’ commitment to raising official
development assistance to attain the UN target of 0.7 percent of GNP by 2007.
Directors encouraged the authorities to continue their efforts on improving the provision of
statistics.
