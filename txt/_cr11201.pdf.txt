STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2011 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
July 7, 2011

KEY ISSUES
Context. With the tepid recovery hitting another soft patch, policies must strike the
right balance between exiting from extraordinary support and sustaining activity.
Fiscal policy. Consolidation needs to proceed as debt dynamics are unsustainable and
losing fiscal credibility would be extremely damaging. However, the pace and
composition of adjustment should be attuned to the cycle. A politically-backed
medium-term framework that raises revenues and addresses long-term expenditure
pressures should be the cornerstone of fiscal stabilization. The official deficit reduction
proposals could be too front-loaded given the cyclical weakness and, at the same time,
insufficient to stabilize the debt by mid-decade.
Nurturing the recovery. Given the central role played by the housing market in the
sluggish recovery, policies to ease its adjustment are particularly important. Also, since
protracted high unemployment could erode job skills and hinder the medium-term
recovery, there is a case for re-examining existing job-training programs and
considering further tax incentives for hiring the long-term unemployed.
Monetary policy. Current monetary policy accommodation, including through the
Fed’s asset holdings, will likely remain appropriate for quite some time, unless inflation
prospects change significantly, in either direction.
Financial policies. The U.S. financial system continues to heal, but remains vulnerable
to key risks, including turmoil in European financial markets and a tail scenario of a U.S.
sovereign rating downgrade and sharply higher interest rates on federal debt, both
with significant implications for liquidity. With nearly all U.S. FSAP recommendations
being addressed, timely and thorough implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act should
continue, including by ensuring appropriate funding for regulatory agencies. Crucial
themes are dealing with systemically important financial institutions, including through
prompt designation and resolution design, and potential migration of systemic risks,
including to less regulated financial actors and across borders.

UNITED STATES

BACKDROP: A TEPID RECOVERY AMID STRAINED
MACROECONOMIC POLICIES
1.
The U.S. economy continues to
recover at a modest pace, in line with
international experience following severe
financial crises. The recovery of U.S. output
has in fact been somewhat stronger than in a
number of other major advanced economies
during the current cycle. However,
unemployment in the United States increased
more sharply than in all other major advanced
economies during the recession and remains
high. When judged against past U.S.
experience, the recovery stands out as very
modest given the extent of the contraction
(Figure 1).
2.
Several indicators point to a
significant growth slowdown in the first
half of 2011, which appears partly related
to transient factors. Private consumption has
lost some impetus since December, reflecting
to a large extent higher world oil prices.
Likewise, transient factors such as the
disruptions to global supply chains from the
Japanese earthquake have depressed specific
sectors (Figure 2). The effect of these shocks
on labor markets and sentiment could carry
part of the weakness into the second half of
2011. Core inflation, which weakened to multidecade lows in late 2010, has started to firm
but remains contained given elevated resource
slack.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

3.

Macroeconomic policies have thus
far remained supportive, but face tighter
constraints going forward. An appropriately
sizable policy response helped prevent
dramatic output declines in the wake of the
crisis, and monetary and fiscal policies have
continued to support demand in the last two
years. However, unsustainable public debt
dynamics and the associated risks of interest
rate pressures or a credit rating downgrade
have brought the need for fiscal consolidation
to the forefront, leaving monetary policy as the
main tool to shore up the recovery going
forward (Figure 3). At the same time, near-zero
policy interest rates and a Fed balance sheet
more than three times larger than at the start
of the economic crisis, together with firming
core inflation, suggest limited room for
significant further easing. A still-wide output
gap, persistent housing and labor market
fragilities, and downside risks to the outlook
call for a cautious approach to unwinding
macroeconomic support. Thus, the main policy
challenge is to strike the right balance
between exiting from extraordinary support
and sustaining the recovery.

UNITED STATES 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

ANATOMY OF A SLOW RECOVERY
4.
The current recovery has been held
back by significant adverse feedback loops
between housing, consumption, and
employment. Housing and labor markets have
been the weakest links. An overhang of vacant
houses from the bubble years has restrained
new construction, and, together with surging
foreclosures, pushed down house prices.
Weaker housing wealth and tighter lending
standards have held back private consumption.

Weak consumption, in turn, has interacted with
a sluggish recovery in job creation, with
unemployment also exacerbating the housing
market weakness. Financial conditions have
improved, particularly for large firms that face
favorable bond financing terms, but remain
tight especially for small firms and real estate.
On the bright side, exports and the
performance of businesses and the financial
sector have improved significantly.

5.
Housing markets remain depressed,
given a large overhang of vacant or
distressed properties—a key legacy of the
housing bubble (Figure 4). The overhang of

vacant residential units—estimated by staff at
around 3 million—has pushed new
construction to historic lows. Residential fixed
investment, which rebounded relatively quickly

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 5

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

UNITED STATES

after most post-war recessions, has thus been
a drag on output and employment in the
current recovery. House prices are also weak,
having dropped again after the expiration of
homebuyers’ tax incentives in mid-2010. The
decline in house prices is in part a natural
consequence of past excesses—as reflected in
a still-significant inventory of houses for sale.
But it is also an outcome of elevated
foreclosures, which have a large negative
effect on prices (beyond the usual effect of
adding to the inventory of houses for sale),
and continue to weigh heavily on house prices
in many regions. Many analysts expect price
declines of 3½ percent in 2011 on a fourthquarter over fourth-quarter basis (with staff
slightly more pessimistic), coupled with a very
subdued recovery over the medium term
(Selected Issues Paper, Chapter 1).
6.
Household balance sheets have
suffered considerable damage from the
housing bust. The leverage of the household
sector—the ratio of liabilities to net worth—
surged as asset prices plummeted during the
crisis and has been declining since then, but
remains elevated (Figure 5). Household debt,
which steadily increased in the years before
the crisis given a sense of ever-rising house
prices, peaked at 133 percent of disposable
income at the end of 2007, declined to
119 percent as of the first quarter of 2011, and
remains above the pre-bubble average of
about 90 percent of disposable income. The
decline in debt has occurred mainly through
defaults, with subdued new loan originations
also contributing.
7.
The state of the housing market
plays an important role in explaining the
weakness of U.S. private demand. Housing
wealth—which accounts for about one quarter

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

of household assets—is an important driver of
private consumption; the recent literature
suggests that the sensitivity of consumption to
housing wealth is about twice the sensitivity to
net financial wealth.i The estimates presented
in Chapter 2 of the Selected Issues Paper
similarly point to sizable effects—a 10 percent
house price appreciation is estimated to raise
consumption by 1.5 percent over the medium
term. While the overall net worth of the
household sector has improved since the start
of the recovery (from about 455 to 500 percent
of disposable income between the second
quarter of 2009 and the first quarter of 2011),
this reflects a rebound in stock prices that
offset the decline in real estate wealth. If real
estate and net financial wealth are weighted by
their estimated impact on consumption (by 9
and 4 cents per one dollar, respectively), there
has been no sustained improvement (Figure 6).
8.
Job growth has been held back by
the weak recovery of aggregate demand as
well as by the low employment intensity of
output gains (Figure 7). Employers responded
to the crisis mostly by laying off workers rather
than by shortening the workweek, and the
recovery has featured a relatively rapid
increase in productivity but sluggish job
creation, for reasons not yet well understood.
The unemployment rate peaked at
10.1 percent in October 2009 and has
fluctuated around 9 percent in 2011. As of May
2011, aggregate employment was 6.6 million
below the pre-crisis peak, and more than
40 percent of the unemployed have been out
of work for six months or more—a record level
of long-term unemployment for the United
States. Broader measures of labor
underutilization (including individuals

UNITED STATES

marginally attached to the labor force and
those working part-time for economic reasons)
also remain near the historic peaks reached in
2010. The labor market participation rate fell
significantly since the crisis given the bleak job
market, and the employment-to-population
ratio has fluctuated around its cycle-trough,
the lowest level in more than 25 years.
9.
Major labor market dislocations
may have pushed up the structural
unemployment rate. Even if the bulk of the
increase in unemployment is cyclical (with staff
estimating the output gap at around 4 percent
in 2011) , mismatches between labor supply
and demand originating from large sectoral
shocks (especially the decline of construction
activity) and weak housing markets appear to
have put upward pressure on structural
unemployment, especially in regions where
both effects are present.ii So far, the recovery
has produced uneven employment gains
across sectors, suggesting that structural
changes could be at play (Selected Issues
Paper, Chapter 3). Long unemployment spells
(which erode work skills) and evidence of a
decline in the efficiency of the matching
process between vacancies and job seekers are
also consistent with some increase in structural
unemployment.iii
10.
Improving financial conditions have
helped underpin the recovery, but healing
is still incomplete (Figure 8). Liquidity is

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

abundant thanks to near-zero policy rates and
unconventional easing. Stock prices are about
15 percent above their August 2010 level, and
market volatility has been contained. However,
lending standards remain tight, especially for
residential mortgages, small enterprises, and
commercial real estate. Commercial banks are
highly capitalized and the quality of their
assets has improved slowly, although the
coverage ratio and the ratio of risk-weighted
assets to total assets are both low. The
financial sector still faces the challenges of
subpar bank earnings and asset shedding by
nonbanks. Net borrowing by the domestic
private sector turned positive in the second
half of 2010, but the household sector is also
still shedding debt.
11.
Securitization activity remains
substantially below pre-crisis levels, with the
virtual disappearance of private-label
residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS)
and complex structures (Selected Issues Paper,
Chapter 4 and Box 1). The market for
mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by the
GSEs fared better than other residential assetbacked securities (ABS) classes, largely as a
result of government support, while private
issuance of RMBS is still basically nil. Much of
the decline in residential ABS issuance is a
result of reduced demand for housing as well
as a rise in investor risk aversion.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 7

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

UNITED STATES

Box 1. The State of Securitization in the United States
Since the onset of the financial crisis, ABS
supply has fallen to a fraction of its peak. In
particular, the issuance of MBS—the largest of
the ABS classes—has declined sharply amid
high levels of home foreclosures and stillrestrictive mortgage credit. Agency MBS
issuance has remained strong on the back of
government sponsorship and the overwhelming
funding advantage of the GSEs, while private
MBS supply has fallen sharply. In addition,
uncertainties over the future of the GSEs are
muddying the outlook for private-label housing
finance.
Much of the decline in ABS issuance is a
result of reduced demand for housing and
reduced investor appetite following the
financial crisis. Sizeable legacy assets still
sitting on balance sheets have dampened
investor interest. Household deleveraging has
reduced demand for loans and correspondingly,
the supply of ABS collateral.

Reserve System, JPMorgan, SIFMA, and Fund staff
calculations.

The Dodd-Frank Act could also affect securitization incentives. Specifically, it will require originators to
retain at least five percent of the securitized credit risks, in response to concerns that there was poor
alignment of securitizer and investor interests. Securitized mortgages that meet “qualified residential
mortgage” (QRM) criteria will be exempt from retention requirements. How strict the criteria will be has not
yet been determined, but few private-label loans are likely to meet the criteria. Preliminary estimates
suggest that the impact of these proposed new rules on the cost and availability of consumer credit will be
limited. Furthermore, in order to ensure the effectiveness of the retention requirement, the regulatory
agencies have proposed that if the securitizers sell the unretained securities at a premium (i.e., for an
amount greater than par) they must place some of this premium into “premium capture” cash reserve
accounts. Industry professionals argue that this provision could severely reduce securitization activity by
significantly shrinking upfront profit realization and cost recovery.
A number of other factors may have also reduced incentives to securitize loans. These include:



historically-low funding rates;



recently introduced accounting rules which make it difficult for banks to remove securitized assets from
their balance sheets and get regulatory capital relief;



the demise of resecuritization vehicles such as structured investment vehicles (SIVs). Markets for these
products are unlikely to revive, given the new higher Basel III risk weights on resecuritization vehicles.
Also, investors are shying away from complexity, as evidenced by the relative simplicity of the products
that have weathered the crisis (e.g., auto ABS).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED STATES 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

12.
While corporate spending remains
relatively weak, firms have had record-high
profit growth and large firms face easy
financing conditions (Figure 9). The deep cuts
in labor input during the crisis were associated
with sharp increases in labor productivity as
the recovery progressed. The flip-side has
been a record-high growth of profits and
stronger corporate balance sheets, with firms
retiring older debt in favor of newer bond
issuance at lower interest rates. Private
investment in equipment and software has
picked up relatively early in the recovery given
strong replacement demand after the plunge
in the crisis. Investment in nonresidential
structures, however, remains very weak.
Overall, non-residential private fixed
investment remains somewhat low in
comparison with pre-crisis averages
(9.9 percent of GDP in 2011Q1 as opposed to
11.4 percent on average between 1997 and
2007). While it is hard to pin down the exact
causes for this weakness, uncertainties on
future demand and widespread unused
capacity utilization seem to be relevant factors.
Importantly, historical correlations suggest
that elevated cash hoardings signal higher
investment going forward (Selected Issues
Paper, Chapter 5).
13.
U.S. exports have been buoyed by
strong external demand, even though the
external sector has not added to growth.
With the recovery in external and domestic
demand, both exports and imports rebounded
strongly in 2010, and the current account

balance deteriorated slightly to -3¼ percent of
GDP in 2010, also reflecting sharply higher oil
prices. Nevertheless, the current account
balance remained well below the average 5¾ percent of GDP in the three years
preceding the crisis (Figure 11). After
appreciating in the first half of 2010, when the
European sovereign crisis boosted flight-toquality flows to the United States, the dollar
has weakened substantially over the past year,
with the real effective exchange rate index
reaching its lowest level in decades. This
depreciation should help support U.S. exports
and current account adjustment going
forward.
14.
Despite a string of very large
current account deficits, the U.S. net
international investment position (IIP) has
deteriorated only modestly during the past
decade, and the net income balance
remains positive. Since 1999, the cumulative
value of U.S. current account deficits exceeded
US$6.3 trillion. This notwithstanding, the U.S.
net IIP (the difference between U.S. financial
claims and liabilities vis-à-vis the rest of the
world) was only -$2.5 trillion (17 percent of
GDP) as of end-2010, in part thanks to
substantial valuation gains due to dollar
depreciation and asset price changes.iv In
addition, given the preponderance of lowyielding debt instruments in U.S. liabilities and
favorable return differentials on foreign direct
investment, the net income balance is still
positive.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 9

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

UNITED STATES

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
15.
Looking ahead, the recovery is
expected to continue despite the expected
fiscal tightening, helped by accommodative
monetary policy, while inflation should
remain subdued. Staff expects GDP growth
between 2¾ percent and 3 percent from 2012
onwards. This implies a slowly narrowing
output gap, in contrast to the rapid narrowing
seen in previous recovery episodes. This steady
but relatively slow recovery is consistent with
the ongoing repair of household balance
sheets and sluggish aggregate labor income
growth (given the slow decline in
unemployment), as well as the projected
medium-term fiscal adjustment. Private
investment in equipment and software is
expected to continue growing at robust rates
to make up for the decline in the rate of capital
accumulation during the recession, while
construction activity is likely to remain weak in
the near term. Given the persistent output gap,
core inflation is projected to remain tame,
despite the recent pickup in commodity prices
(Selected Issues Paper, Chapter 6).
16.
Over the medium term, both saving
and investment are projected to rise,
leaving the current account deficit broadly
stable around current values. Household
saving is expected to soften with the fiscal
withdrawal in the next couple of years but

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

return roughly to its current level over the
medium term, as fiscal deficits remain high,
interest rates rise, and incomes recover with
declining unemployment. Public saving is also
projected to rise as the output gap shrinks,
stimulus expires, and some corrective
budgetary measures come into place. Private
investment would recover toward pre-crisis
averages as a percentage of GDP, with
construction activity rebounding in line with
the normalization of new household formation.
The current account deficit is projected to
remain around 3 percent of GDP over the
medium term.
17.
Core inflation remains subdued,
despite some recent firming (Figure 10).
Against a backdrop of persistently high
unemployment, wage inflation is tepid.
Twelve-month core consumer price inflation
trended up to 1.5 percent in May 2011, after
declining to 0.6 percent at the end of 2010,
reflecting some pass-through from commodity
prices and a number of temporary factors.
Twelve-month headline consumer price
inflation climbed to 3.5 percent in May 2011,
on firmer core inflation and the spike in
commodity prices. Elevated resource slack and
stable longer-term inflation expectations
should keep core inflation trends in check in
the near term.

Downside risks to the outlook have
increased. These include:




Renewed housing market weakness, with
the possibility of larger-than-expected
house price declines. Foreclosure starts
have come down in past months, but this
reflects, to a large extent, delays due to
legal problems with past foreclosures. A
future uptick in foreclosure starts is thus
likely, in light of the very large “shadow
inventory” of houses (estimated by staff at
around 6 million units),v and this may not
be fully reflected in current price dynamics;
Unfavorable fiscal outcomes. These could
take the form of a sudden increase in
interest rates and/or a sovereign
downgrade if an agreement on medium-

term consolidation does not materialize or
the debt ceiling is not raised soon
enough.vi These risks would also have
significant global repercussions, given the
central role of U.S. Treasury bonds in world
financial markets. At the opposite extreme,
an excessively large upfront fiscal
adjustment could significantly weaken
domestic demand;


Further commodity price shocks, which
could impact both growth and inflation;



Credit supply constraints. The ability of the
financial sector to support a faster
economic expansion remains uncertain,
with weak securitization markets and tight
loan standards for most sectors;

Challenging conditions for some European
sovereigns. A renewed bout of instability in
European sovereign and bank debt
markets could lead to global financial
turmoil, including increased tensions in
U.S. money markets, given their short-term
dollar funding to major European banks.

On the positive side, the recovery could
surprise on the upside if confidence improves
and pent-up demand for consumer durables
materializes more quickly, or if hiring picks up
faster than expected, given healthy corporate
balance sheets.
19.
The authorities broadly agreed with
staff’s near-term outlook and risks, but
considered that the recovery could be
firmer next year as headwinds lessen. They

saw subdued residential construction as the
key impediment to a faster recovery going
forward, and a less prominent role for further
household balance sheet repair. The
authorities were optimistic about a rebound of
construction at some point in the next few
years, in view of the expected normalization in
household formation rates and the eventual
absorption of excess supply. They also saw the
risk of unfavorable fiscal outcomes as more
contained than staff. As in previous
consultations, the authorities considered staff’s
medium-run outlook as excessively pessimistic,
in view of their own higher estimates of
potential output. Relatedly, they saw most of
the increase in unemployment as cyclical, but
acknowledged risks that the natural rate could
have risen somewhat.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Discussions focused on the challenges posed by the need to exit from extraordinarily
accommodative policies with a still fragile recovery, including the urgent task of
adopting a politically-backed plan for stabilizing public finances in the years ahead;
the policies needed to secure the recovery over the medium term; accomplishments
and remaining tasks in financial sector reform; as well as current account
adjustment and the challenges of global rebalancing. U.S. policy choices are of
central importance for the global economy—U.S. growth spillovers are uniquely
large since the United States is the world’s largest economy and has globallydominant financial markets. Policy spillovers have been a particular focus of this
year’s analysis, as discussed in the relevant sections below and in more detail in the
accompanying U.S. Spillover Report (see also Box 2).

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED STATES

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Box 2. U.S. Policy Spillovers to the Rest of the World
Process. Spillover reports examine the external effects of policies in five systemic economies (the “S5”): China, the
Euro Area, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. In each case, key partners are asked about outward
spillovers from the economy in question, on the basis of which staff choose issues for analysis. To facilitate candor,
spillover reports do not cite who raised a specific issue. Those consulted were officials and analysts from the other
S5 and from selected emerging markets—Brazil, Hong Kong SAR, India, Indonesia, Korea, Mexico, Poland, Russia,
Singapore, and Thailand. The report focuses on a few forward-looking issues raised by partners, brings to bear
relevant analysis, and describes the reactions of the U.S. authorities.
Policy issues. Other authorities expressed concerns on U.S. policy spillovers from quantitative easing and its exit, as
well as ongoing fiscal and financial policies. Interlocutors mainly discussed financial market spillovers, including the
impact of abundant dollar liquidity on commodity prices, emerging market exchange rates, and associated capital
flows. This is consistent with the team’s analysis which finds that, beyond close neighbors, U.S. spillovers to foreign
activity come mainly through financial market links. This underscores the need for clear communication of major
policy moves, such as the eventual ending of the zero interest rate policy, to avoid financial market disruption.
Findings. The main messages flowing from staff analysis are:



Short-term U.S. spillovers on growth abroad are uniquely large, mainly reflecting the pivotal role
of U.S. markets in global asset price discovery. While U.S. trade is important, outside of close
neighbors it is the global bellwether nature of U.S. bond and equity markets that generates the majority
of spillovers.



Spillovers from macroeconomic stimulus supported foreign activity more in 2009 than in 2010.
Facing global turmoil, 2009 initiatives calmed global markets. In the less fraught environment of 2010,
similar policies produced a less favorable market response.



Overall, U.S. and foreign interests may be better aligned for fiscal and financial policies than for
monetary ones. For the former, there is a common interest in limiting global tail risks, while for the latter
low interest rates inevitably support financial risk-taking that can complicate policy options for countries
with strong cyclical positions.

A. Fiscal Policy: In Search of a Medium-Term Framework
20.
Staff and authorities concurred on
the need for fiscal stabilization, with staff
emphasizing the urgency of agreement on a
politically-backed framework. Discussions
surrounded the desirable pace, extent and
form of consolidation. It was agreed that
policies should stabilize the public debt-toGDP ratio by mid-decade and gradually reduce
it afterwards. But despite the recent health
care reform and the proposed 5-year freeze on
non-security discretionary spending, federal
finances remain unsustainable (Box 3); state

and local government finances also face
significant challenges (Box 4 and Selected
Issues Paper, Chapter 7). This year, the federal
deficit could reach 9 percent of GDP, with the
general government deficit nearly 10 percent
of GDP. vii While this is less than projected at
the time of April 2011 World Economic
Outlook due to revenue overperformance and
lower-than-expected outlays, the deficit would
remain among the highest for advanced
economies.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 13

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

UNITED STATES

Box 3. Long-Term Outlook for the U.S. Federal Government Finances
The U.S. federal finances are on an
unsustainable trajectory. According to the
authorities’ budget projections, federal debt held
by the public is projected to increase from
62 percent of GDP in FY2010 to about 90 percent
in FY2030, and continue rising thereafter owing to
pressures from population aging and rapid cost
growth in the health care sector. The debt
dynamics are even bleaker under the IMF staff’s
more conservative macroeconomic assumptions.
Because the financial crisis is expected by IMF staff
to cause a permanent loss of output and
budgetary revenues, federal debt could exceed
95 percent of GDP already by the end of this
decade—approaching the levels last seen in the
aftermath of World War II—and put upward
pressure on interest rates both in the United States
and abroad.
The long-term budgetary outlook remains
troublesome despite the existing efforts to curb
deficits. Although last year’s health care reform is
expected to bend the health care “cost curve” to some
(highly uncertain) degree, the federal health care bill
could still increase by 3 percent of GDP over the next
20 years according to the Congressional Budget
Office. Other measures proposed by the
administration as part of the draft FY2012 budget
such as the 5-year freeze on non-security
discretionary spending and defense savings are
helpful, but cannot on their own address the
fundamental long-term budgetary pressures, because
mandatory health care, pension, and other spending
make up a greater share of the budget and are
projected to grow faster (see Figure 12).

The authorities have a number of options to achieve fiscal sustainability without large negative shortterm effects on activity. Social Security reform would help reduce long-term fiscal imbalances without
undermining the ongoing recovery—measures such as increasing the retirement age while indexing it to
longevity and trimming future benefits for upper-income retirees would have a minimal impact on current
private spending. Identifying additional saving in health care and other mandatory spending categories
would also be highly desirable, including through greater cost sharing with the beneficiaries, curbs to the tax
exemption for employer-provided health care, and targeted savings identified by the President’s Fiscal
Commission. Meanwhile, the tax system is riddled with loopholes and deductions worth over 7 percent of
GDP. Gradually reducing these tax expenditures (including eventually the mortgage interest deduction which
largely benefits upper-income taxpayers) would help raise needed revenue while enhancing efficiency. In the
longer term, consideration could also be given to introducing a national VAT or sales tax, as well as carbon
taxes.

Box 4. Fiscal Challenges Facing the U.S. State and Local Governments
State and local governments (SLGs) have
so far managed to cope with the fallout
from the Great Recession, but at a
considerable social cost. The recession hit
tax collections very hard given the exposure
to very weak housing and labor markets and
consumer spending (Figure 13). Aggressive
spending cuts, some revenue measures, and
reserve drawdown have kept the operating
budgets roughly balanced as required by
law, with a significant federal emergency aid
smoothing adjustment to the lower revenue
trend. However, the involuntary fiscal
consolidation at the state and local level has
imparted considerable social costs, with
significant cuts in education, health,
transport, and welfare systems.

especially to local governments. Rainy-day
funds which have been depleted in almost
half of the states will need to be replenished to rebuild room for maneuver. The state and local government
will also need to continue addressing their large unfunded entitlements, especially pensions (estimated in a
wide range of $1–3 trillion), which present a long-term risk in a number of states due to strong legal
protections of the already-accrued pension benefits. The SLGs will also face structural spending pressures
from health care, both through higher Medicaid outlays and health benefits for government retirees.

Following a spell of risk aversion in the state and local government bond markets late last year, the
situation has calmed down significantly (Figure 13). Lower bond supply following the expiration of the
Build-America-Bond program, stronger tax collections, and adjustment measures adopted by the lowestrated states (California, Illinois) helped improve market sentiment. More generally, defaults are unlikely at
the state level given low debt, balanced budget rules, and statutory protections for investors. Some
vulnerabilities remain at the local level, with risks from the housing market and cuts in state and federal
transfers. That said, local defaults have historically been rare events.

21.
On the pace of consolidation, the
authorities’ envisage a frontloaded
withdrawal, but details remain under
Congressional debate. The President’s
February budget proposal would cut the
federal deficit to 4.6 percent of GDP in FY2013,
over-delivering on the G-20 Toronto
commitment to halve the federal deficit by
FY2013. Deficit reduction over FY2012–13
would largely reflect expiring stimulus, lower
military spending, and cyclical recovery.
However, ongoing discussions over the debt
ceiling and FY2012 appropriations, the recent
soft patch in growth, and technical factors
complicate an assessment of the likely pace of
adjustment.viii
22.
Staff considered the February
budget could be too front-loaded given the
cyclical weakness and downside risks.


The staff recommended a broadly uniform
reduction of the federal structural primary



deficit over the next five years within a
fully-specified and politically-backed
consolidation plan (Staff Adjustment
Scenario in table). This strategy would rein
in the deficit without taking an undue toll
on the still-sluggish recovery (Box 5). The
staff’s recommended FY2013 deficit target
would be around 6 percent of GDP—over
1 percentage point of GDP higher than
under the administration’s scenario.
Although financing conditions are benign
for now (Figure 3), starting a withdrawal in
FY2012 would hedge the risk of a
disruptive loss in fiscal credibility. Absent a
fully-specified consolidation framework,
fiscal adjustment should proceed more
rapidly. The authorities agreed that fiscal
consolidation should proceed gradually,
but considered the anticipated growth
drag from their current plans as
manageable.

Box 5. Short-Run Effect of Fiscal Policy on Activity
The pace and composition of fiscal adjustment is important because it matters for short-term economic
activity. Under the staff projections, expiration of temporary stimulus programs, lower defense spending and new
deficit reduction measures will help reduce the federal deficit by 3¾ percent of GDP over the next two fiscal years,
subtracting roughly 1 percentage point from GDP growth in both 2012 and 2013.



Expiration of targeted spending measures such as infrastructure investment, emergency aid to local
governments, and unemployment benefits will be felt more with growth multipliers between 0.75–1.
Expiring tax provisions will have a somewhat smaller effect with multipliers between 0–0.6, with the
multipliers for corporations and upper-income taxpayers closer to the lower bound. Lower defense
spending will directly affect output by reducing government consumption and investment.



The October 2010 World Economic Outlook finds that while fiscal consolidation is beneficial in the
medium run, the short-term effects on output are negative. The average short-run multiplier is estimated
at around ½, but fiscal consolidation has a larger negative effect in the short run if the perceived risk of
sovereign default is low, monetary policy is close to the zero bound, and trading partners are also
consolidating. Consolidation is less contractionary when it relies on cuts in transfers and government
consumption (multipliers are around ¼). The multipliers are larger for public investment, above ½. They
tend to be largest for indirect tax hikes with a more than one-for-one fall in output, because central
banks tend to tighten in response to inflationary pressures associated with such tax changes.

5½ percent of GDP, assuming that the
temporary payroll tax cut and emergency
unemployment benefits are renewed. The

structural primary withdrawal would be
around 3½ percent of GDP over two years,
broadly in line with the staff’s preferred

consolidation plan. Should the growth
outlook worsen considerably,

years, provided—crucially—that a
medium-term framework is in place and
financing conditions remain favorable.
23.
On the extent and form of
consolidation, the President’s April speech
outlined the administration’s medium-term
strategy. The proposed framework would save
about $4 trillion over 12 years (some
20 percent of GDP) and would—according to
the authorities—put public debt on a
downward path in the second half of the
decade.ix Measures worth $1–2 trillion could
be decided during June and July amid the
debate on raising the debt ceiling (which must
be raised by August 2, per the Treasury). In
addition, a debt stabilization mechanism
(“debt failsafe”) would trigger automatic
spending cuts or revenue increases if the debt
ratio does not stabilize.

24.
Staff considered that a larger and
wider-ranging consolidation than
envisioned in the budget and the
President’s speech would be needed, on the
basis of staff’s less favorable
macroeconomic assumptions.


Under the staff’s adjustment scenario, a
cumulative structural primary deficit
reduction of 7½ percentage points of GDP
(about 1½ p.p. per year) would achieve the
objective of stabilizing the debt ratio by
mid-decade, and then gradually reducing it.
The President’s February budget proposal
(based on above-consensus growth
projections) falls short of this target by
2½ percent of GDP. Savings identified in
the April speech would reduce but not
eliminate the required additional
adjustment.



The deficit reduction plan will need to
include both changes to entitlement
programs and revenue-enhancing
measures, given pressures from population
aging and excess cost in the health care
sector. Administration proposals would
already cut the share of non-security
discretionary spending in GDP to very low
levels. Additional measures (discussed in
Box 3) can include Social Security reform,
additional savings in health care and other
mandatory spending categories, and
reducing tax expenditures (which amount
to 7 percent of GDP according to the
President’s Fiscal Commission). In the
longer term, consideration could also be
given to introducing a national value
added tax (VAT) or sales tax, as well as
carbon taxes. The administration agreed
on the need for broad-based adjustment,
but noted that given the divided Congress,
a fundamental reform of entitlements and
the tax code may need to wait until after
the 2012 elections. Discussions on deficit
reduction measures are ongoing in the
context of the debt ceiling debate.

25.
Staff and the authorities agreed that
institutional enhancements could play a
useful role in supporting fiscal
consolidation. The debt “failsafe” mechanism
and a multi-year expenditure envelope for
non-security discretionary spending could help
keep consolidation on track across the annual
budget cycles. While welcoming the proposed
reforms, staff cautioned against
overemphasizing the failsafe mechanism given

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

the mixed experience with automatic spending
cuts (see Selected Issues Paper, Chapter 8). It
recommended that the deficit reduction plan
include as many specific measures as possible,
and noted that clear specification of the
medium-term fiscal objectives—formally
endorsed by Congress—was essential. In
addition, since the administrations’ growth
projections remain well above the Consensus
and CBO forecasts, staff saw merit in attaching
greater weight to private sector forecasters
and other outside institutions, as is customary
in countries such as Canada and Germany. The
authorities argued that the proposed failsafe
mechanism would provide a protection against
deficit overruns in case of weak medium-term
growth.
26.
Spillovers analysis suggests that
fiscal consolidation has clear long-term
global benefits (Box 2). Staff analysis suggests
that short-term losses are likely small beyond
close trading partners (Canada and Mexico).
Indeed, consultations with other authorities on
U.S. policy spillovers underscored their
concerns with the possible international
ramifications of lack of U.S. fiscal adjustment
on long-term interest rates and the dollar.
Staff analysis suggests that a credible, phasedin U.S. fiscal consolidation would forestall a
rise in U.S. (and foreign) yields, and hence limit
short-term negative spillovers, reinforcing the
case for such a policy. Authorities agreed that
U.S. fiscal stabilization would bring global
benefits, but saw growth spillovers from fiscal
policy as larger and more wide-ranging than in
staff’s analysis.

B. Housing Markets: The Challenge of Easing Adjustment
27.
With the housing market slowly
adjusting to past overbuilding, discussions

focused on whether and how to alleviate its
strains and the risk of a severe further drop

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 19

UNITED STATES

in house prices. Staff and authorities expect
the housing market to stabilize over the next
couple of years, and to gradually recover
thereafter. However, there is a risk of house
price undershooting given the sizable shadow
inventory of potential distress sales. Such sales
have a disproportionately large effect on
average house prices (and thus on the broader
economy), likely reflecting a combination of
factors including negative neighborhood
externalities from foreclosed houses as well as
destruction of value linked to lack of
maintenance. In turn, administrative
complexity, capacity constraints, and
conflicting incentives among banks, servicers,
and bond investors have thus far hindered
potentially efficient loan modifications that
would avoid at least part of the costly
foreclosures. Taken together, these factors can
justify further policy action to mitigate distress
sales, even though the housing market already
has different forms of subsidies (Selected
Issues, Chapters I and II). Authorities and staff
agreed that distress sales are the main driving
force behind the recent declines in house
prices—in fact, excluding distress sales, house
prices had stopped falling.
28.
Staff advocated strengthened
foreclosure mitigation policies, given the
common view that the existing programs
have had limited effectiveness (Box 6). The
authorities noted that the Making Home
Affordable programs were not originally
designed to address underwater and
unemployed borrowers (the biggest
proportion of borrowers in default at the
moment) and pointed to the complexities in
designing and implementing modifications.

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

They also pointed to their efforts to address
problems related to mortgage servicers,
including through the establishment of
national mortgage servicing standards, an
initiative supported by staff. Staff further
advocated:


Allowing mortgages to be modified in
courts (“cramdowns”). Implementing this
long-standing Fund recommendation
would create incentives for voluntary
modifications at no fiscal cost. The
authorities agreed on its potential
usefulness but noted that a similar
proposal had failed to garner sufficient
political support in 2009.



Expanding state programs that assist
unemployed homeowners and adopting
parametric changes to existing
programs (e.g., lowering the back-end
debt-to-income ratios and bringing the
loan-to-value ratio below 100 percent in
programs like HAMP-PRA). The authorities
noted that the former is currently under
consideration and acknowledged that high
back-end debt to income ratios raise redefault rates. However, they noted that
modifications to aggressively reduce loanto-value (LTV) ratios would lead to moral
hazard, and pointed out that a large
proportion of negative equity mortgages
(where the outstanding loan balance
exceeds the value of the home) remains
current. Staff suggested to attach clauses
to these modifications to ensure the
sharing of gains from future home price
appreciation between homeowners and
the counterparty in the modification.

Box 6. Administration’s Response to the Housing Crisis
The Administration has undertaken a variety of measures to tackle the foreclosure epidemic, but so far
with limited results. For example, as of end-March 2011 only $1.4 billion out of the $45.6 billion allocated
through the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) for housing support measures has so far been disbursed. More
specifically:



The Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP), which reduces monthly payments on existing first-lien
mortgages, provides financial incentives for servicers and investors to perform sustainable modifications,
including by requiring lenders to consider a Principal Reduction Alternative. HAMP has only completed
670,000 permanent modifications out of the 1.6 million modifications started since the program’s inception;
another 2,174 permanent modifications have been completed on Federal Housing Administration (FHA)insured loans through the FHA-HAMP program.



With lenders reluctant to write off second-lien mortgages, the Second Lien Modification Program has only
completed 21,230 modifications so far.



The Home Affordable Foreclosure Alternatives Program, aimed at encouraging short sales and deed-in-lieu
for borrowers unable to complete a modification, has so far completed only 5,250 short sales or deeds in lieu
of foreclosure transfers.



The Administration’s Home Affordable Unemployment Program, providing temporary forbearance on the
unemployed, has only 7,400 participants thus far.



The Hardest Hit Fund Program has committed $7.6 billion to heavily distressed states for foreclosure
mitigation policies, but so far only $165 million have been spent. FHA’s Short-Refinance Program (an $8billion foreclosure prevention and mortgage relief plan launched in September 2010 to assist qualified nonFHA insured underwater homeowners to refinance into an-FHA-insured mortgage if the lender agrees to write
off at least 10 percent of the first mortgage’s principal balance) had only refinanced 107 loans through endMarch.

Other policy initiatives were relatively more successful in supporting the housing market. The homebuyers
tax credit—that expired last summer—has supported, at least temporarily, housing sales while the private sector,
including the GSEs, has started 2.2 million modifications under Hope Now. The homebuyer tax credit brought
forward future demand so there has naturally been some payback after its expiration (Figure 4). More than 800,000
FHA-insured mortgages have avoided foreclosure via loss mitigation plans, while support to Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac facilitated continued access by households to affordable mortgage credit. The Federal Reserve and
the U.S. Treasury purchased more than $1.4 trillion in agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) through
independent purchase programs, helping to keep mortgage rates low.



Encouraging GSEs to participate in
principal write-downs would significantly
increase the scope for modifications. The
Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA)
estimates that, out of its 30 million pool of
guaranteed mortgages (worth US$5
trillion), around 600,000–800,000 are
currently underwater and in default. The
FHFA, the regulator of the conservatorship,
has so far declined to allow principal

writedowns on the grounds that many
have subordinate liens and mortgage
insurance, which would mean that the
benefits of successful modifications would
mostly benefit others, writedowns would
impose losses on GSEs, which is
inconsistent with the mandate of
conservatorship, and they would induce
underwater homeowners to

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 21

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

UNITED STATES

intentionally default. Staff agreed that the
latter risk existed but noted that the
positive externalities from lowering the
housing market uncertainty induced by the
large shadow inventory of houses would
likely outweigh these costs, especially
taking into account the large contingent
fiscal liability of the U.S. Treasury.x
Furthermore, staff pointed to the analysis

by the Office of the Comptroller of the
Currency (OCC) which indicate that
modifications significantly reducing
monthly principal and interest payments
consistently perform better. Staff also
suggested providing additional incentives
for further deed in lieu and short sales
(Selected Issues Paper, Chapter 9).

C. Labor Markets: Lowering Unemployment and Improving Matching
29.
Authorities noted that a number of
recently adopted measures helped buoy the
labor market and speed up hiring. The
administration has enacted several programs
to speed up hiring, including the “jobs
agenda” and the December 2010 stimulus
package, which included a temporary payroll
tax cut for employees. Authorities attributed
part of the pickup in hiring at the end of 2010–
beginning of 2011 to the payroll tax cuts and
viewed past efforts as important to limit labor
market slack. Staff suggested that some
measures (extension of unemployment
insurance and the payroll tax cuts) could be
extended in 2012 and/or new targeted
measures to induce hiring of the long-term
unemployed could be enacted, given the longterm consequences of degradation in work
skills with adverse effects on productivity, real
wages, and trend consumption spending.
Authorities stressed that any deviation from
existing policies would depend on labor
market performance in the remainder of the
year.
30.
Staff inquired whether risks of
higher structural unemployment justify a
re-evaluation of existing policies to train
and place the unemployed into jobs. Staff
remarked that the federal government has
22

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

nearly 50 different programs dispersed across
nine federal departments geared toward
helping the unemployed, but with a
cumulative budget of only 0.1 percent of GDP.
Moreover, a large part of this budget is
transferred to states, which have many
programs of their own.xi Thus, it could be
important to assess whether some
consolidation of the system—with better
funding—would be more effective in
facilitating the labor market adjustment.
Authorities recognized that some reevaluation
of existing programs could be productive but
stressed that the education system—which is
not part of this array of programs—also plays
an important role in re-training the
unemployed. Officials argued for using
community colleges (as in a recent
government initiative geared toward
manufacturing jobs), which offer flexible
curricula and are more aligned to the demands
of local employers, as a way to channel
training programs.
31.
Looking ahead, institutional reforms
could limit the volatility of U.S.
employment during the next cycle. The U.S.
labor market has benefited from great
flexibility, but at the cost of high employment
volatility, which may have medium-term

UNITED STATES 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

consequences when the unemployment rate
does not recover quickly. Staff and authorities
agreed that adopting some aspects of the
short-time compensation programs present in
other countries (e.g., Germany and, to a lesser

extent, Canada) could help reduce the cyclical
burden on employment.

D. Monetary Policy: Continued Accommodation
32.

having provided needed support to the
recovery while maintaining inflation
expectations well anchored. The strategy has

included near-zero policy rates, clear
communication that conditions would likely
warrant exceptionally low policy rates for an
extended period, and a second round of
unconventional easing beginning in the Fall of
2010 in response to the weakening of inflation
and growth. Federal Reserve officials
considered that large-scale asset purchases
had effects on the real economy through
conventional monetary transmission channels,
even if their impact on longer-term yields had
been more direct than those of conventional
policy.xii They noted that the impact of the

second large scale asset purchase program on
longer-term yields had been harder to detect,
as markets incorporated the policy into their
expectations over a period of time, rather than
in response to discrete policy announcements
as in the first round of asset purchases.xiii
33.
Well-anchored inflation
expectations and significant resource
underutilization suggest that the
extraordinarily low level of short-term
interest rates will likely remain appropriate
for quite some time. The mission and the
authorities agreed on the importance of
remaining vigilant to the risk of an unmooring
of long-term inflation expectations in either
direction. More generally, the speed and
timing of future actions should depend on
incoming data on core inflation, longer-term
inflation expectations, and growth, with scope
to react to a more aggressive fiscal
consolidation through a slower withdrawal of
monetary stimulus. Although temporary
factors—including pass-through from higher
commodity prices—had recently pushed core
inflation up, the authorities anticipated that
inflation would fall back to more subdued
levels over the coming quarters as those
effects passed and as persistent labor market
slack would keep wages in check.

maturing securities, short-term policy interest
rates would serve as the main active tool to
fine tune the adjustment of monetary
conditions. Reducing excess reserves by
ceasing reinvestments of the principal of at
least a portion of maturing securities, as well
as other reserve-draining operations, including
the use of repos and term deposits, would also
help tighten the link between the federal funds
target rate and the interest rate on reserves. A
clearly communicated and gradual path of
asset sales would be an additional step in the
exit process. Federal Reserve officials stressed

24

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

that members of the Federal Open Market
Committee would continue to weigh the
relative merits of various sequencing options
for the eventual normalization of monetary
policy.
35.
From the perspective of monetary
policy spillovers to the rest of the world,
the main risk is a likely reversal of some of
the inflows to emerging markets if markets
suddenly bring forward expectations of
monetary tightening, suggesting a
premium on clear communication. While the
second large scale asset purchase program
had limited spillovers and its ending will have
even less as it is fully anticipated, there is a risk
that when the Fed gets closer to tightening,
e.g., by draining liquidity, Treasury yields could
jump and there could be sharp capital
outflows from emerging markets, particularly if
this were unexpected. This is because such a
shift would be the precursor to future rate
hikes (or swift balance sheet unwinding),
thereby signaling smaller interest rate
differentials and either greater confidence in
the U.S. expansion or rising inflationary
pressures. Senior Fed officials considered that
most capital flows to emerging markets were
structural, suggesting limited risk of significant
pull-backs in response to monetary tightening.
The spillovers analysis highlights that clear
monetary policy communication has benefits
from an international perspective, further to
the well-known domestic benefits. In this
context, staff welcomed the introduction of
regular press briefings to present the Federal
Open Market Committee’s economic
projections and to provide further context to
its decisions.

UNITED STATES 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

E. Financial Policy: Restoring Financial Resilience
36.
Discussions focused on the health of
the financial system and the policy response
to the crisis. On financial system health, the
authorities noted that government
investments were being steadily repaid, with
banks paying a net $12 billion so far, and Fed
financial system support at minimal levels
(Table 6). Banks’ tier 1 risk-based capital ratios
stood at 13 percent and the leverage ratio at
9.1 percent at the end of 2011Q1 (compared
with just under 10 percent and 7½ percent
respectively at end-2008), while the tier 1
common capital ratio for SCAP institutions
stood at 9.8 percent.xiv Liquidity indicators had
improved as well, although increased reliance
on business deposits (boosted by the increase
in holdings of liquid assets by nonfinancial
corporates) was a concern. Profits were
recovering, but largely owing to reduced
provisioning (with some concerns by the
authorities that this might be premature).
Meanwhile, the return on assets remained
weaker than pre-crisis levels, partly reflecting
the de-risking of balance sheets (as the share
of risk-weighted assets declined to low levels),
and was likely to remain soft given the subpar
economic recovery.
37.
Staff and authorities agreed that
important vulnerabilities remained,
especially from potential spillovers from
possible turmoil in Europe.xv While direct
credit exposures to the most stressed
countries were modest (see Box 7), banks had
substantial exposure to major European
institutions. These institutions also played
important roles in U.S. derivatives, securities
and lending markets, raising additional
channels for spillovers. Last but not least,
strains among the European banks could

disrupt U.S. money market funds, which hold
considerable amounts of their paper. Staff also
expressed concerns that stress in the U.S.
Treasury market related to the approaching
debt limit could severely disrupt global
financial stability. Treasury officials expressed
confidence that a budget agreement would be
reached in time to ward off Treasury market
volatility.
38.
While banks’ balance sheets were
strong enough to support lending, a revival
of securitization was seen as essential to
supply the needed credit into a stronger
recovery. Securitization had collapsed to a
fraction of its pre-crisis level, notably in private
residential mortgage-backed securities, which
were weighted down by a combination of
housing market fragility, weak demand for
residential properties, and regulatory
uncertainty. The team and the authorities
agreed that initiatives to strengthen risk
retention and disclosure and redefine the roles
of the rating agencies (with greater emphasis
on investor due diligence along with steps to
address potential conflicts of interest) were
essential. Authorities disagreed with private
concerns that proposals for risk retention were
stifling private securitization, noting that
reforms would over time revive the market by
improving investor confidence. Authorities saw
the dominance of the housing GSEs as a more
important obstacle to a recovery of private
mortgage securitization, but also as a needed
support at the current juncture—and thus as
an issue for the longer term.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 25

Box 7. U.S. Financial Exposure to Europe
U.S. money market funds (MMFs) continue to have sizeable exposures to European financial institutions.
According to market analysis, based on a sample of the 10 largest MMFs, which represent 45 percent of the total
prime fund universe, exposure to European banks account for roughly half of total U.S. MMFs assets. French banks
(at nearly 15 percent of MMFs assets) form the largest country exposure while 40 percent of the funds' total assets
are concentrated in 15 banks. Therefore, if European sovereign distress reverberated to European banks, U.S.
MMFs could face significant strain.
Evidence on exposure of U.S. banks to Euro area peripheral countries is mixed. Banking statistics from the BIS
and the Federal Reserve indicate limited direct claims of U.S. banks on European peripheral countries at the end of
2010, while potential exposure—including derivatives, unused credit commitments, and guarantees—is much
larger. However, estimates of these potential exposures are amplified by the lack of data on the insurance bought
by U.S. banks against default in European peripheral countries, which would offset default insurance sold.
Despite heightened sensitivity to the outlook on Euro area sovereign debt, market information suggests
that investors do not appear overly concerned about the potential spillover to U.S. banks.1 Using market

concerns regarding Euro area
sovereign debt, U.S. banks’ sensitivity to events in Euro area peripheral countries appears modest (chart). The low
sensitivity may reflect U.S. banks’ modest direct exposures to these countries, as well as their robust investment
banking returns over 2010. Still, were distress in Euro area peripheral sovereigns spill over to core Euro area banks,
the potential impact on U.S. banks could be much higher, given their significant exposures to those banks.
Overall, the exposure of the U.S. to Europe via financial linkages is a cause for concern. As discussed in Box 5
of the 2010 Article IV staff report, financial linkages with Europe are much stronger than trade linkages. While
exposure of US banks’ to European periphery would seem limited, the main concern is that if sovereign credit
events in Europe adversely affected European banks, including in core countries, U.S. money market funds could
be severely strained via their exposure to those banks.

UNITED STATES

39.
On the policy overhaul in response
to the crisis, discussions were shaped by the
FSAP conducted in 2010, as well as the
Dodd-Frank Act (DFA) enacted in July 2010.
The DFA—along with the range of
international initiatives under the Basel
Committee, Financial Stability Forum and other
groups—broadly spanned the issues raised by
the FSAP. While the authorities noted that 32
of the 33 key FSAP recommendations had
been completed or were being implemented
(Box 8), staff expressed concerns that the
regulatory system remained fragmented (a key
unaddressed recommendation), posing
challenges to coordination domestically and
internationally. Also the effectiveness of the
new regulatory framework in stemming
systemic risk and containing risks from toobig-to-fail was yet to be tested. Moreover,
headwinds to implementation—including
funding new activities and making key
appointments—posed concerns for the team.
Despite these headwinds, the authorities felt
that implementation had progressed well, with
many key regulations issued. They considered
that the Financial System Oversight Council
(FSOC) was off to a strong start, with several
technical level committees (with
representatives of all agencies) working fully
engaged. Fed officials noted the work of the
newly-established Office of Financial Stability
Policy and Research as playing an important
role in their surveillance of systemic risks.
40.
The team saw it as essential to move
ahead expeditiously in three key areas:

27

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND



Dealing with systemically important
financial institutions (SIFIs): The team urged
prompt designation of SIFIs—a key FSOC
responsibility. SIFIs—including investment
banks and other nonbanks—should face
tough capital and liquidity standards to
internalize systemic risks. The authorities
concurred, noting the key role of measures
to strengthen the ex-ante resilience of the
financial system to future crises. They
thought that banks could meet stiffer
capital requirements without difficulty, but
saw enhanced liquidity requirements as a
higher hurdle (specifics remained to be
decided). Designation would take time,
given the complexity of the associated
analysis. Authorities thought that
resolution plans (“living wills”) for SIFIs
could reduce systemic risks and strengthen
crisis resolution, even though they were no
substitutes for ex-ante measures to reduce
systemic risk. Staff was skeptical that
several large institutions could be resolved
simultaneously in stressed markets, and
encouraged officials to use DFA powers to
preemptively streamline firms that were
too complex to resolve in a crisis.



The potential migration of risks to “shadow
banking”: the team saw it as essential to
apply rules and supervision that avoided
the reemergence of this destabilizing
dynamic. In addition, steps such as floating
asset valuation, capital, or backstops are
needed to deal with fragilities in money
market funds, to avoid the “runs” that
occurred post Lehman. Strengthening
nonbank liquidity management was
especially important given the possible
migration of liquidity risks outside banks,
the fact that nonbank liquidity support was
limited to emergency facilities (the Fed’s

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

UNITED STATES

13 (3) powers), and that DFA required the
Fed to defer to the fullest extent possible
to examinations by extant regulators. The
authorities were vigilant for liquidity risks
and risk migration, and considered that

they had adequate tools to respond, with
the FSOC playing the role of “residual
claimant” of financial system risks that
might otherwise fall through the cracks.

Box 8. U.S. FSAP Recommendations One Year Later and DFA Implementation
Nearly all of the FSAP recommendations were addressed by the Dodd-Frank Act, but their
implementation is an ongoing process and it is premature to assess the effectiveness of the new
oversight framework. The Dodd-Frank Act (DFA) in July 2010 changed the landscape of U.S. financial sector
oversight addressing many of the deficiencies identified in the U.S. Financial Sector Assessment Program
(FSAP) concluded in early 2010 (see Table 7 on FSAP recommendations). As of June 1, 2011, 24 of the 87
studies required by DFA had been completed. At the same date, as per the estimated 385 DFA statutory
deadlines for rulemaking, rules had been finalized in 24 instances and proposed in 115, while 28 deadlines
had been missed and 218 were forthcoming.1 The lengthy implementation process will likely impede for
some time a firm assessment of the impact of the new regulation on the financial system and on the
effectiveness of its oversight. However, a preliminary assessment of the thrust of the progress in meeting the
six main categories of FSAP recommendations is discussed below.
First, the FSOC has defined its internal structure and processes and has started work on key issues
institutionalizing systemic risk oversight. The FSOC established a deputies’ committee to coordinate and
oversee its work, a systemic risk committee and two sub-committees to analyze emerging threats to
financial stability, and five standing committees of staff from the member agencies for the regular and
ongoing responsibilities. The authorities reported that the committees meet frequently and that individual
agencies are actively involved in supporting FSOC activities and in healthy discussions on systemic risk. The
FSOC held five meetings and issued three Notices of Proposed Rulemaking: respectively on the designation
as systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs) of financial market utilities, non banks, and on data
collection. Two studies were issued, on the Volcker’s Rule and on the concentration limit for large financial
companies. No systemically important financial institutions to be subject to heightened prudential standards
have been designated yet. The first annual report is expected to be published in the second half of the year.
Second, the limited restructuring of the regulatory architecture is progressing. Although the substantial
simplification of the U.S. regulatory system along functional lines advocated by the U.S. FSAP was not
pursued, the modest streamlining introduced by the DFA, with the transfer of the responsibilities of the
Office of Thrifts and Supervision (OTS) to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Federal Reserve (Fed) is on track. The Federal Insurance Office
(FIO) and the Bureau of Consumer of Financial Protection (BCFP) were established, although the delay in the
designation of the director of the BCFP poses concerns on the effectiveness of its actions.
Third, micro-prudential regulation and supervision are being strengthened. The authorities reported
that supervision for the banking sector within the Fed has taken a more macro-prudential orientation and
cooperation among banking agencies have significantly increased. The implementation of enhanced
prudential regulation for designated SIFIs and banking organizations with more than $50 billion in assets is
also forthcoming. As for the oversight of securities and derivative markets, the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) and the Commodities Futures Trade Commission (CFTC) have proposed a large number of
rules and are working closely together to get those implemented. Progress is expected on the
recommendations on discouraging the use of deposits in the shadow banking system and on the repo
market, while for money market funds disclosure has already been increased. Finally, in the insurance sector,
which continues to be a complex state-based regulatory system, a number of rules to strengthen regulation
are being considered.

28

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED STATES 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Box 8. U.S. FSAP Recommendations One Year Later and DFA Implementation (continued)
Fourth, the oversight of market infrastructure is being reinforced. The Fed is working to implement the
provisions of the DFA that allow the Fed to offer accounts and services to designated systemically important
financial market utilities. The Fed is also working with other agencies to bolster the oversight of clearing, payment,
and settlement systems. The CFTC and the SEC proposed rules to adopt many of the Committee on Payment and
Settlement Systems (CPSS) and IOSCO recommendation for central clearing counterparties.
Fifth, crisis management, resolution and systemic liquidity arrangements are being bolstered. Rules
implementing the new orderly liquidation authority (OLA) of the FDIC over bank holding companies and
designated SIFIs are being proposed. Rulemaking to implement “living wills” for large and complex financial
groups is also underway. The size of the Deposit Insurance Fund was allowed to increase, and a limited widening
of the range of counterparties and collateral in open market operations was pursued.
Finally, the too-big-too fail issue is being addressed with additional prudential provisions, while reform of
the GSEs is being contemplated. In addition to OLA and living wills, the Fed is developing heightened prudential
standards for large banking organizations and non-bank SIFIs. The DFA also provided regulators with authority to
take pre-emptive actions when the above institutions pose a grave threat to the financial stability of the U.S. or fail
to submit a credible living will. Various proposals on the future of the GSEs are being examined, most notably
those laid out in the Administration’s white paper.

required to issue a rule jointly, the rulemaking requirement is counted for each of the agencies involved. If joint rules are
excluded, the number of required rulemaking decreases to 243. The number of proposed rules does not include rulemaking
requirements for which the deadline has been missed.

Financial surveillance under the FSOC: staff
saw as essential to have transparent and
proactive surveillance of systemic risks and
policy responses under FSOC as it moves
beyond the initial implementation stage.
Given the complexity of the supervisory
framework and the fact that only two of
ten FSOC voting members have a
macroeconomic remit, transparency would
be key to reinforce the focus on systemic
risk; in this context, the team welcomed
the forthcoming annual report. The
authorities saw the FSOC process as
working well, fostering continuous
interaction among committee and
subcommittee members on financial
stability issues. The authorities stressed
their commitment to the transparency of
the FSOC, while they also considered that a
balance needs to be struck as the
disclosure of sensitive information could

precipitate market volatility. The DFA
requirement that FSOC voting members
submit signed statements to Congress
affirming whether they believe that all
reasonable steps are being taken to ensure
financial stability and mitigate systemic
risks would guarantee strong
accountability.
41.
Authorities agreed that international
coordination was key to avoid cross-border
regulatory arbitrage. They saw coordination
as working well. Supervisors and regulators
were in frequent close contact under the aegis
of international groupings such as the Basel
Committee, Financial Stability Forum, and the
International Organization of Securities
Commissions (IOSCO), with overall agendas
and key principles and standards closely
aligned. That said, some major issues—such as
cross-border resolution of SIFIs (given the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 29

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

UNITED STATES

large number of complex, systemic cross
border firms and international differences in
legal frameworks for resolution) and
derivatives (the level of clearing and rules for
margining of uncleared swaps) would be
complex and remained under active
discussion. Authorities saw their timetable as
more aggressive than in their overseas
partners, opening up the possibility of
regulatory gaps, notably in securities and overthe-counter (OTC) derivatives regulation.
42.
Staff noted that the risk of spillovers
to and from the U.S. financial system
strengthened the case for making the U.S.
financial system more resilient. In this
connection, the Dodd-Frank Act seemed to
have reduced the risk of potential knock-on
effects from U.S. financial instability. That said,
analysis in the Spillovers Report highlighted
that the investment banking activities
(including by non-U.S. firms) could propagate
shocks internationally via the U.S. dollar
wholesale funding markets, underscoring the
need for strong prudential supervision of
those activities. The authorities agreed that
cross-border financial linkages remained
sizeable, but also considered that the domestic
and international agendas were well aligned at
a high level, and coordination would continue
to improve going forward.

43.
Looking to the longer term,
authorities and staff agreed that the current
government presence in the housing
market was neither sustainable nor
desirable. The Administration’s plans,
articulated in their February 2011 report to
Congress (Reforming America’s Housing
finance Market) would shift the government’s
focus to (i) oversight and consumer protection,
(ii) assistance for low- and moderate- income
homeowners and renters, and (iii) support for
market stability and crisis response. The report
offers three long-term options: (i) a fully
privatized system of housing finance, with the
government helping low and middle-income
borrowers; (ii) a privatized system plus a public
guarantee mechanism that can be scaled up in
a crisis, with an above-market guarantee fee
that would be attractive only during market
stress; or (iii) a privatized system plus public
catastrophic reinsurance, with first-loss
insurance coverage from private sources. Staff
urged that housing finance reform should be
complemented by gradually reducing
distortions such as the mortgage interest
deductions, which are expensive, regressive,
and bias homeownership towards large
homes. Congress could deliberate proposals as
early as this fall.

F. The United States and the World Economy
44.
Staff stressed that policy actions to
raise savings, including by restoring fiscal
sustainability, and strengthening the
financial sector would make an important
contribution to global growth and stability.
With household saving rates projected to
remain close to current levels in the medium
term, higher public savings would help ensure

30

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

that the U.S. current account deficit remains
moderate as domestic investment gradually
recovers, as well as forestall the risk of adverse
global spillovers from higher U.S. interest rates
driven by public debt dynamics.
45.
Staff saw the medium-term U.S.
current account deficit remaining at around
3 percent of GDP, still somewhat in excess

UNITED STATES 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

of CGER benchmarks (which are around
1½–2½ percent of GDP), implying some
dollar overvaluation. The April CGER
calculations suggested a 0-15 percent
overvaluation range for the U.S. dollar.xvi The
authorities broadly concurred with staff’s
range for current account projections. They did
not take a view on the appropriateness of the
level of the dollar, but noted that the change
in U.S. trading partners towards emerging
markets with lower costs and prices implied
that the level of U.S. prices relative to trading
partners was not as low as traditional real
effective exchange rate indices would suggest.
46.
The authorities agreed on the need
for a global rebalancing of demand, but
expressed some concerns that global
imbalances may be widening again. They
agreed that U.S. fiscal consolidation was
essential over the medium term and would
contribute to global rebalancing, and argued
that policy actions in surplus countries to
boost domestic demand and increase currency
flexibility were crucial to achieving the goals of

the G-20 Framework for Strong, Sustainable,
and Balanced Growth.
47.
The mission encouraged the
authorities to intensify their efforts to
secure the future of multilateral trade
negotiations. With the prospect of concluding
the Doha Round by year-end diminishing, the
authorities expressed their commitment to
engage on concluding a subset of “early
deliverables.” At the same time, the authorities’
trade negotiations will focus on concluding the
three pending FTAs with Colombia, South
Korea, and Panama by year-end, and on
advancing the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP)
with APEC members.xvii The authorities’
objectives of these negotiations will remain
firmly on expanding jobs and economic
growth by creating new export opportunities.
Noting that U.S. recourse to protectionist
measures has remained limited, staff
welcomed authorities’ efforts to resist these
pressures and to ensure that any trade-related
legislation is consistent with WTO and other
international obligations.

STAFF APPRAISAL
48.
Policies must strike the right
balance between exiting from extraordinary
support and sustaining the recovery amid
renewed headwinds. Fiscal consolidation
needs to proceed as debt dynamics are
unsustainable and losing fiscal credibility
would be extremely damaging for the United
States and for the rest of the world. With a
still-fragile recovery, the pace and composition
of fiscal adjustment need to be attuned to the
cycle, with the current sizeable monetary
policy accommodation remaining in place,
unless inflation prospects change significantly.
Housing and labor market policies can help

cushion the ongoing adjustment process and
help lay the foundations for a more sustained
recovery going forward.
49.
The key priority for fiscal policy is
to stabilize the debt ratio by mid-decade
and gradually reduce it afterwards,
consistent with the administration’s
objectives. In this context, staff sees early
political agreement on a comprehensive
medium-term consolidation framework based
on realistic macroeconomic assumptions as a
cornerstone of a credible fiscal adjustment
strategy. With a well-defined multi-year
framework in place, the pace of deficit

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 31

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

UNITED STATES

reduction in the short run could be more
attuned to cyclical conditions without
jeopardizing credibility. And of course, the
federal debt ceiling should be raised
expeditiously to avoid a severe shock to the
U.S. economy and world financial markets.
50.
Staff’s recommended adjustment
strategy entails a reduction of the federal
structural primary deficit at a broadly
uniform pace over the next five years,
within a fully-specified and politicallybacked consolidation framework. Fiscal
adjustment should start in FY2012 to guard
against the risk of a disruptive loss in fiscal
credibility, and encompass cuts in mandatory
spending (including through entitlement
reforms) as well as revenue increases
(including by reducing tax expenditures) given
the relatively limited size of non-security
discretionary spending and the large cuts
already envisaged in this area. Consideration
could also be given to a national VAT or sales
tax and carbon taxes, consistent with past
advice by Fund staff.
51.
The fiscal framework should include
an explicit Congressional endorsement of
the main medium-term fiscal objectives.
Multi-year expenditure caps on non-security
discretionary spending would help keep the
consolidation on track across annual budget
cycles, while a “failsafe” mechanism for the
debt ratio along the lines recently suggested
by the President could, if robustly formulated,
help protect against deficit overruns and other
contingencies. It would also be helpful to
prepare the administration’s budgets using
conservative economic assumptions.
52.
Subdued inflation and significant
resource underutilization suggest that the
extraordinarily low level of short-term

32

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

interest rates will likely remain appropriate
for quite some time. The Fed should remain
vigilant to the risk of an unmooring of longterm inflation expectations, and respond
decisively should the risk materialize in either
direction. More generally, the speed and
timing of future actions should depend on
incoming data on core inflation, longer-term
inflation expectations, and growth, with scope
for cushioning a larger fiscal consolidation
through a more back-loaded withdrawal of
monetary stimulus.
53.
When appropriate, a gradual
unwinding of the Fed’s balance sheet seems
to be a reasonable first step in normalizing
monetary conditions. Against the backdrop
of a passive unwinding of the Fed’s securities
holdings through ceasing the reinvestment of
the principal of maturing securities, short-term
policy interest rates would serve as the main
active tool to fine tune the adjustment of
monetary conditions. Reducing excess reserves
by ceasing reinvestments, as well as other
reserve-draining operations including the use
of repos and term deposits, would also help
tighten the link between the federal funds
target rate and the interest rate on reserves. A
clearly communicated and gradual path of
asset sales would be an additional step in the
exit process.
54.
Staff sees merit in further policy
efforts to ease the adjustment of housing
and labor markets within the fiscal
envelope.


While policy design is complicated by
operational capacity constraints and the
risk of inducing moral hazard, housing
difficulties are central to the slow recovery

UNITED STATES

and pose a critical risk. Therefore,
consideration should be given to allowing
for the terms of residential mortgages to
be changed in courts (“cramdowns”),
strengthening federal mortgage
modification programs, expanding state
programs that assist unemployed
homeowners, and encouraging the GSEs to
participate in principal write-downs.


Persistently high unemployment rates and
the need for significant job reallocation
across sectors warrant a re-examination of
existing active labor market programs (e.g.,
job training and job-search assistance). The
education system could also play a strong
role in retraining the unemployed,
including through community colleges.
Further tax cuts attached to programs
aimed at spurring hiring of long-term
unemployed workers could be enacted.

55.
The U.S. financial system continues
to heal, but remains vulnerable. Bank
profitability has recovered and bank capital
has increased, but underlying profits are weak,
and the rise in capital ratios also reflects a shift
towards less risky assets. Mortgage markets
remain largely government dependent.
Turmoil in European financial markets could
impact both liquidity and credit provision. Even
more significantly, the tail risk of a U.S.
sovereign rating downgrade and sharply
higher interest rates on federal debt more
generally could trigger renewed turbulence in
global financial markets, with adverse
consequences for global growth.
56.
A sustainable rebound in private
securitization, driven by reforms to avoid
the past excesses, would help meet credit
demand as the recovery takes hold. The

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

reforms underway—in particular, steps to
increase disclosure and risk retention—will
strengthen incentives for sound underwriting,
and should help revive investor demand. On
the supply side, clarity on the final scope of the
new rules would help the market recovery.
Looking forward, reforms to streamline the
role of GSEs (preferably, confining their
activities to providing credit guarantees for
high-quality mortgages under tail risks) would
encourage a gradual shift in the mortgage
market towards private institutions.
57.
Progress in implementing the DoddFrank Act is encouraging, with nearly all
U.S. FSAP recommendations being
addressed, but headwinds to
implementation are of concern. Appropriate
budgetary resources to fund improvements in
supervision and regulation should be promptly
allocated, and efforts to delay or water down
the legislation should be resisted. Prolonged
delays or outright failures in addressing the
regulatory gaps revealed by the crisis, in an
environment of plentiful liquidity and
increased financial concentration, could feed
another very dangerous buildup in systemic
risks.
58.
Strengthening the domestic and
international crisis-prevention architecture
for financial institutions should be a
priority. Key is promptly and comprehensively
identifying systemic institutions to be subject
to heightened supervisory scrutiny, regulatory
standards, and capital surcharges. These
should include investment banks and other
nonbank financial institutions, which provide
significant cross-border dollar funding.
Authorities are also encouraged to continue
their work on improving resolvability of
systemically important institutions. Systemic
issues and risks to financial stability are central

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 33

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

UNITED STATES

to the FSOC mandate and staff looks forward
to their discussion in the first FSOC annual
report. The authorities also need to be alert to
potential new risks arising from changes in the
regulatory framework that could contribute to
shifts in financial stability risks across borders
or intermediaries. International collaboration
will be critical for progress in this area, and the
U.S. authorities should continue exercising
leadership on these matters.
59.
A multilateral approach to economic
policy management remains critical. This is
particularly important in systemic countries like
the United States, whose policy actions have
significant cross-border effects, as discussed in
the spillovers report. Staff welcomes the
authorities’ leading role in multilateral fora and
their efforts to promote international stability.
For the medium term, the key contributions
that the United States can make to global
growth and stability, consistent with the G-20
Mutual Assessment Process, are (i) raising
domestic savings, particularly through fiscal
consolidation, to ensure that the current
account deficit declines further and to forestall

34

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

potentially destabilizing increases in public
indebtedness; and (ii) strengthening its
financial sector through enhanced regulation
and supervision. The United States can no
longer play the role of global consumer of last
resort, underscoring the importance of
measures to boost demand in current account
surplus countries to sustain world growth. The
U.S. dollar depreciation over the past year
would help increase demand for U.S. exports
and contribute to global rebalancing.
60.
Staff welcomes the limited recourse
to protectionist measures, and encourages
the authorities, together with other countries,
to redouble their efforts to secure the future of
multilateral trade negotiations, especially if the
Doha Round is not concluded by year-end.
Increased and more secure market access
would promote U.S. and global exports.
61.
Staff proposes to hold the next
Article IV Consultation on a 12-month cycle.

Table 7. U.S. FSAP Key Recommendations
(ST: short-term, implementation within 12 months; MT: medium-term, 1–3 years; HP: high priority; MP: medium priority.)
Recommendation
Institutionalize and strengthen systemic risk oversight
• Establish a council of the regulatory agencies, the Fed, and the Treasury, with a mandate for financial
stability and powers inter alia to designate potentially systemic financial firms for enhanced regulation
and supervision focused on systemic risk
• Define the Fed as the lead executor of this council and the consolidated supervisor of designated
potentially systemic financial firms, to work with other regulators
• Provide the Fed oversight authority over systemically important payment, clearing, and settlement
infrastructure
Redesign the regulatory architecture
• Strengthen the Fed’s role in consolidated regulation and supervision, including by enhancing
coordination with bank and functional regulators and restricting deference requirements
• Unify safety-and-soundness regulation and supervision of commercial banks and thrifts in a single
federal agency and eliminate the federal thrift charter
• Unify federal securities and derivative market regulation into one federal agency
• Establish an independent and accountable federal consumer protection agency, removing this
responsibility from the other agencies to enhance their focus and effectiveness in their primary roles
• Establish a federal office tasked with promoting greater regulatory uniformity in the insurance sector
Strengthen micro-prudential regulation and supervision
Banking
• Enhance the capacity for group-wide oversight of banking groups and conduct regular inter-agency
horizontal assessments of complex groups (possibly by establishing domestic supervisory “colleges”)
• Boost timeliness and forcefulness of supervisory and regulatory interventions to address weaknesses in
enterprise-wide risk management practices
• Strengthen channels for cooperation, coordination, and learning from best practices—within and
among the federal banking agencies (FBAs), market regulators, and the states—to close regulatory gaps
and prevent regulatory arbitrage, including with regard to charter conversions
Securities and derivative markets
• Enhance enforcement and oversight capacities and re-examine capital rules and other prudential
requirements, such as risk management standards, to ensure that risks are fully addressed
• Implement the recommendations of the Joint Report to enhance investor protection and improve
cooperation between the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC); close legislative and regulatory gaps identified in the Joint Report
• Complete the consolidation of equity and equity option market surveillance into a single entity taking
into account issues of dark pools, high-frequency trading, predatory algorithms, and other technologybased practices
• Promote standardization of OTC derivatives in order to increase market reliance on exchange trading and
multilateral clearing and require proper collateralization of all derivative transactions, whether held at a
clearinghouse or bilaterally
• Improve transparency of OTC derivative and securities markets by requiring timely reporting of
transactions and providing better information to investors

Recommendation
Shadow banking and other short-term funding markets
• Discourage the use of deposit-like instruments outside the formal banking sector and ensure
appropriate liquidity management by sectors potentially falling within the systemic liquidity safety net

Timing,
Priority
ST, HP

• Set minimum haircuts for repo transactions and address incentives for the repo clearing banks to extend
intraday credit in the clearing and settlement cycle
• Require money market funds to make real-time disclosures of their actual (as opposed to “stabilized”) net
asset values
Insurance
• Develop the supervision of insurance groups through consolidated financial reporting and establish
policies and procedures for the regulation of systemically important institutions, markets, and
instruments in the insurance sector
• Increase information sharing and coordination between state regulators and federal authorities,
including through representation of state regulators in national bodies with responsibilities for systemw ide oversight
• Strengthen regulation of bond insurance and securities lending and modernize solvency requirements

ST, HP

• The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) and state legislatures should undertake
reforms covering the terms of Commissioners’ appointments, the rulemaking pow ers of state insurance
departments, and their funding and staffing to bolster specialist skills
Strengthen oversight of market infrastructure
• Allow systemic payment, clearing, and settlement infrastructures to have accounts at the Fed in order to
settle in central bank money and to have emergency access to Fed liquidity under terms and conditions
established by the Fed’s Board of Governors as an additional buffer against systemic risk
• The Fed should continue to assess payment, clearing, and settlement infrastructures for their ability to
cope with extreme liquidity stress and explore the introduction of a queuing and offsetting mechanism
in the Fedw ire Funds Service similar to those in other G10 countries’ large value payment systems

MT, MP

MT, MP
MT, HP
MT, MP
MT, MP

ST, HP
ST, MP

• Clearing and settlement infrastructures should enhance their risk management procedures by increasing ST, MP
the frequency of stress testing from monthly to w eekly and strengthening liquidity back-up facilities
Enhance crisis management, resolution, and systemic liquidity arrangements
• Extend the special pow ers of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to enable receivership or
conservatorship of BHCs and systemically important financial firms
• Review the funding arrangements for the Deposit Insurance Fund by removing the ceiling on the size of
the fund and increasing its size
• Implement “living w ill” requirements for large and complex financial groups, and address group
structures that appear likely to severely impede effective resolution
• Consider widening the range of counterparties and collateral used for open market operations (OMO)
and articulating policies for future Fed lending to nonbank financial firms to enhance the scope and
predictability of systemic liquidity provision
Address too-big-to-fail issues and the future of the GSEs
• Discourage size and complexity by subjecting systemic financial institutions to more stringent prudential
requirements
• Provide regulators the authority to take pre-emptive actions when vulnerabilities build at potentially
systemic financial firms
• Reform the housing GSEs, possibly by privatizing their retained asset portfolios and re-assigning
responsibilities for social objectives/system support to an explicitly guaranteed public utility

Unless otherwise noted, all figures in this section refer to the federal government budget data
on a fiscal year basis (the fiscal year ends September).
viii

Government agencies responded to uncertainties created by the delayed FY2011
appropriations by postponing spending, and it remained unclear how quickly the outlays could
rebound. There is also uncertainty about durability of the recent revenue overperformance.

A number of other policymakers and analysts have outlined their consolidation plans—see a
website by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget for a detailed summary:
http://crfb.org/compare/index.php?id=01 .

According to FHFA, a 25 percent drop in house prices would lead to about $110 billion in net
additional GSE injections by end-2013 (the gross injection would be about twice as large,
including the injections that would be paid back to the Treasury in the form of dividends).

U.S. Government Accountability Office, “Employment and Training Programs: Opportunities
Exist for Improving Efficiency,” Testimony to Congress, April 7, 2011.
xii

Under the first round of unconventional easing, the Federal Reserve purchased $1.25 trillion of
agency MBS, about $175 billion of agency debt, and $300 billion of longer-term Treasury
securities, with purchases completed in March, 2010. The Fed launched a second round of large
asset purchases in November, 2010, with $600 billion in purchases to be completed by the end of
June, 2011.
xiii

Research by Federal Reserve economists (e.g., by Gagnon, Maskin, Remache, and Sack, “LargeScale Asset Purchases by the Federal Reserve: Did They Work?”, Federal Reserve Bank of New
York Staff Reports, No. 144) finds that the first round of unconventional easing lowered the tenyear Treasury yield by 50–75 basis points (3–4 basis points for each $100 billion in purchases). A
similar elasticity would suggest an effect of around 20 basis points for the second round of
unconventional easing. The cumulative effects would correspond to a federal funds target rate
cut of roughly 300 basis points (see Rudebusch, “The Fed's Exit Strategy for Monetary Policy” San
Francisco Fed Economic Letter No. 2010–18).

Payments Restrictions. The United States accepted Article VIII of the IMF's Articles of

Agreement and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions and multiple currency practices
with the exception of limited restrictions on certain payments and transfers imposed for security
reasons. The United States currently administers approximately 30 economic sanctions programs,
which restrict certain payments and transfers for transactions against particular foreign
governments, entities, and individuals. The United States administers, inter alia, sanctions programs
relating to Burma, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and Sudan, and continues to block certain previously
frozen assets of the former Yugoslavia. Several other sanctions programs, including those relating to
Côte d’Ivoire, Liberia, Somalia, Syria, Western Balkans, and Zimbabwe are “list-based” programs,
affecting only members of certain government regimes and other individuals and groups whose

activities have been determined to threaten the foreign policy or economy of the United States. The
United States also implements similar list-based sanctions programs against: narcotics traffickers;
terrorism-related governments, entities, and individuals; and proliferators of weapons of mass
destruction.

Article IV Consultation. The 2010 Article IV consultation was concluded in July 2010 and

the Staff Report was published as IMF Country Report No. 10/249. A fiscal ROSC was completed in
the context of the 2003 consultation. An FSAP involved two missions, during October 14–November
3, 2009 and February 17–March 12, 2010. The FSSA was discussed at the board, together with the
2010 Article IV Consultation, on July 26, 2010.
The 2011 Article IV discussions were conducted from May 27–June 27, 2011. Concluding meetings
with Chairman Bernanke of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and Treasury
Secretary Geithner occurred on June 23 and 27. The Acting Managing Director, Mr. Lipsky, and WHD
Director, Mr. Eyzaguirre, participated in the concluding meetings. A press conference on the
consultation was held on June 29, 2011. The team comprised (at different times) Rodrigo Valdés
(head), Gian Maria Milesi-Ferretti, Charles Kramer, Marcello Estevao, Oya Celasun, Nicoletta Batini,
Martin Sommer, Evridiki Tsounta, Grace Bin Li, and Geoffrey Keim (all WHD); Sally Chen (SPR);
Francesco Columba and John Kiff (MCM). Ranil Salgado, Nagwa Riad, and Mika Saito (SPR)
contributed with advice on trade policy and Steve Dawe (LEG) with analysis on AML/CFT issues.
Some meetings were also attended by members of the USA Spillovers team. Ms. Lundsager
(Executive Director) and Mr. Lindquist (Advisor) attended some of the meetings. Outreach included
discussions with the private sector and think tanks. Unless an objection from the authorities of the
United States is received prior to the conclusion of the Board’s consideration, the document will be
published.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on the United States
July 21, 2011
1.
This note reports on information that has become available since the staff report
(SM/11/167) was issued and does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Incoming data since the completion of the Article IV consultation in mid-June
point to downside risks to the staff’s near term forecast. Recent data indicate a marked
slowdown in the growth of employment, aggregate labor income, and consumption, and
weaker consumer confidence. All told, activity has been weaker than expected, with GDP
growth in the second quarter of 2011 tracking between 1.5 and 2 percent at an annualized
rate, below the staff’s WEO projection of 2.6 percent. Twelve month core consumer price
inflation increased to 1.6 percent in June, slightly above expected, while headline consumer
price inflation was around 3.5 percent.
3.
Negotiations over the federal debt ceiling are ongoing. Both the Democratic and
Republican leaders have committed to lifting the ceiling before the August 2 deadline, but a
basic political agreement on the underlying fiscal consolidation framework is still lacking.
Moody’s placed the U.S. sovereign credit rating on a review for downgrade last week, citing
concerns about possible technical default. Standard and Poor’s has indicated a more than
50 percent likelihood of downgrade over the next three months given the lack of consensus
on the medium-term fiscal consolidation framework. The market reaction has been muted so
far, with the 10-year Treasury yield trading below 3 percent and the CDS spreads remaining
broadly stable. Adverse market dynamics cannot be ruled out, however, as policymakers
approach the debt ceiling deadline without basic contours of an agreement. Failing to raise
the debt ceiling on time would have disastrous consequences for the U.S. and global
economy.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with the
United States
On July 21, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with the United States.1 The consultation documents are accompanied by a
report analyzing the spillovers from U.S. policies to the rest of the world.
Background
The U.S. economy continues to recover from its worst financial crisis since the Great Depression,
aided by supportive macroeconomic policies. Monetary policy remains highly accommodative,
with policy rates near zero and a significantly expanded Federal Reserve balance sheet. Fiscal
policy provided a sizable stimulus to demand over 2009–2010, but the fiscal impulse for the
current fiscal year is likely to be about zero. The financial system continues to strengthen,
although lending conditions remain tight for some segments. Household balance-sheet repair has
continued amidst still declining house prices and high unemployment rates, weighing on
consumption, while construction activity remains depressed. Corporate spending and hiring
remain relatively weak, despite record-high profit growth and easy financing conditions for large
firms. GDP growth slowed from 2¾ percent (saar) in the second half of 2010 to just under
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return
to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive
Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the First Deputy Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's
authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

2 percent (saar) in the first half of 2011, reflecting inter alia the impact of higher oil prices and
several transient factors. The U.S. current account deficit has moved broadly sideways as higher
oil prices have offset the effects of strong external demand and the dollar’s depreciation. Overall,
the slow pace of the recovery is consistent with past international experience in the aftermath of
housing and financial crises.
The outlook is for continued albeit modest growth. With sluggish private domestic demand
economic slack remains large: in particular, the unemployment rate has declined only modestly
from its recent peak. As a result, inflation pressures will likely remain contained, despite the
recent firming in core inflation. Risks are elevated and tilted to the downside, especially from the
housing market and possible global financial market disruptions from the sovereign crisis in
Europe.
On the policy front, the administration and Congressional policymakers have presented mediumterm fiscal adjustment proposals, and current negotiations suggest that fiscal policy is set to enter
a consolidation phase to address its unsustainable trajectory. The Federal Reserve has indicated
that economic conditions are likely to warrant an accommodative monetary policy stance for an
extended period and any future policy moves would depend on incoming data, including on
inflation expectations.
On the financial sector front, the official financial support deployed during the crisis is being
wound down and the legislated reform of financial supervision and regulation is being
implemented. In particular, the Financial Stability Oversight Committee (FSOC) has ramped up
operations and numerous rules are being promulgated. However, many issues remain to be
worked out, notably in areas involving systemically important financial institutions and
international coordination.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors observed that the economic recovery continues at a modest pace, though
slowing down recently due partly to some transient factors. Directors noted that depressed real
estate markets, persistent high unemployment, and weak consumer confidence have held back
growth prospects. While macroeconomic policies have remained supportive thus far, fiscal policy
faces tighter constraints going forward, given unsustainable public debt dynamics. With a stillwide output gap and downside risks to the outlook, especially potential spillovers from European
financial markets, Directors called for a cautious approach to unwinding macroeconomic support.
Directors agreed that placing public debt on a sustainable path is critical to the stability of the U.S.
economy, with positive spillovers to other countries. They welcomed the administration’s objective
to stabilize the debt ratio by mid-decade and gradually reduce it afterward. Directors highlighted
the urgency of raising the federal debt ceiling and agreeing on the specifics of a comprehensive
medium-term consolidation plan. With a well-defined, credible multi-year framework in place, the

3
pace of deficit reduction in the short run could be more attuned to cyclical conditions.
Directors generally concurred that fiscal adjustment should start in FY2012 to guard against the
risk of a disruptive loss in fiscal credibility. The strategy should include entitlement reforms,
including additional savings in health care, as well as revenue increases, including by reducing
tax expenditures. Directors welcomed the administration’s proposals for multi-year expenditure
caps on non-security discretionary spending and a “failsafe” mechanism that would trigger
automatic actions against deficit overruns.
Directors broadly agreed that, given prospects for subdued inflation and significant resource
underutilization, an accommodative monetary policy will likely remain appropriate for quite some
time. They called for continued vigilance to inflation developments and a decisive policy response
as appropriate. When conditions warrant a monetary exit, a gradual reduction of asset holdings,
accompanied by clear communication, was viewed as an essential first step.
Directors noted that further efforts are needed to address problems in the housing and labor
markets. Measures to mitigate distressed sales and facilitate loan modifications would help
stabilize house prices, while the reform of the government-sponsored enterprises should be
accelerated. Directors encouraged a re-examination of existing active labor market programs,
including job training and education programs.
Directors commended the authorities for the significant progress in repairing and reforming the
financial sector, notably the implementation of the FSAP recommendations and the establishment
of the Financial Stability Oversight Council. They encouraged the authorities to promptly allocate
appropriate resources to fund the improvements in regulation and supervision, and to resist
pressures to water down the legislation. Strengthening the crisis prevention framework for
financial institutions is a priority, particularly in light of the global role played by the U.S. financial
system. Directors emphasized in particular the importance of subjecting systemically important
financial institutions to heightened scrutiny and prudential standards, and looked forward to
further progress in this area. They commended the United States for its active engagement in
fostering international coordination on financial regulatory reforms.
Directors welcomed a multilateral approach to economic policy management in the context of the
spillover exercise. They noted that U.S. performance and policies have uniquely large spillovers
to the rest of the world mainly through financial linkages, although some Directors noted that
spillovers through the trade channel should not be underestimated. Important contributions that
the United States can make to global growth and stability include (i) raising domestic savings,
particularly through fiscal consolidation, and (ii) strengthening financial sector regulation and
supervision. A number of Directors cautioned that the extraordinarily low level of interest rates in
the United States may have encouraged excessive risk-taking, affected cross-border capital
flows, and added to global inflationary pressures. Some also saw the potential risk of capital flow
reversals that could arise from the eventual monetary exit by the United States, underlining the
importance of policy communication, although some others were of the view that capital flows are

4
driven increasingly by structural factors. Directors welcomed the authorities’ continued
commitment to secure the success of multilateral trade negotiations.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat
