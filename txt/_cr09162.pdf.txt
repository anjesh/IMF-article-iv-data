EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
•

Focus. The mission focused on measures to manage the risks and vulnerabilities arising
from the global financial crisis, slowing world growth, and collapsing commodity prices.

•

Background. Canada entered the financial crisis on a solid footing, reflecting a strong
macroeconomic framework, rigorous financial regulation, and robust corporate balance
sheets. While it has avoided severe spillovers, international linkages are pressuring
financial conditions and economic growth.

•

Economic outlook. Policy stimulus will lessen the downturn, although growth will likely
contract in 2009 before rebounding modestly in 2010. A widening output gap will push
core inflation to low levels. Uncertainties about global growth and international financial
stability tilt risks to the downside.

•

Financial sector. Canadian banks have weathered the crisis better than major-country
peers, but the credit cycle will be challenging, particularly given high household debt.
Financial instability is a tail risk, but heightened vigilance is warranted.

•

Monetary policy. The Bank of Canada has appropriately loosened monetary policy,
bringing the policy rate target to a record-low ½ percent. Maintaining an accommodative
stance until economic recovery is firmly underway would ward off deflation risks.

•

Fiscal policy. The recession and recent fiscal stimulus will end an 11-year string of
surpluses. The 2009 Budget, along with provincial measures and the effects of past steps,
includes total measures of about 2 percent of GDP per year over 2009–2010, adequate in
present circumstances. Fiscal room is available to enact further stimulus if downside risks
materialize. To maintain confidence in medium-term fiscal sustainability, the government
can stress the aim to pursue its debt reduction targets when recovery begins.

•

Analytical work. Background studies examine the reasons for Canada’s comparative
financial stability; linkages between financial conditions and growth; the role of
commodity prices in the duration of economic slumps in commodity exporters; regional
house-price dynamics; and the Canadian mortgage market.

I. MACROECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL PROSPECTS AND RISKS
Despite Canada’s close real and financial linkages to the United States, it has so far avoided
the virulent spillovers seen elsewhere, as it entered the crisis on a strong footing. This
reflects sound financial regulation and conservative banking practices, fiscal prudence, and
a credible and effective monetary policy framework, including a freely-floating currency.
Nevertheless, strains are evident, and the authorities are appropriately responding with
stimulus and steps to support financial stability. With the global outlook marked by unusually
high uncertainty, the main task for policymakers is to maintain continued vigilance and
readiness to respond if tail risks are realized.
A. Entering the Global Crisis from a Position of Strength
1.
Canada entered the global financial turmoil on a solid footing (Figure 1). Through
2007, sound macroeconomic and financial policies along with a commodity boom delivered
strong growth, price stability, fiscal and current account surpluses (Figure 2), historically low
unemployment, and financial stability. Corporate and bank leverage were low, although high
household debt and regional real-estate bubbles presented vulnerabilities.
2.
Nevertheless, the crisis has impacted growth and financial conditions. Canada is
an open economy with strong real and financial linkages with the global economy, especially
the United States, which accounts for about three-quarters of Canada’s exports and around a
quarter of funding for Canadian businesses. These links have affected Canada in several
ways:
•
Economic slowdown. Contracting external demand has depressed real exports; the
wealth effects of falling equity, commodity, and house prices, along with financial
tightening, have dampened domestic demand (Figure 3). Real GDP contracted by 3.4 percent
(saar) in the fourth quarter of 2008 after a weak performance earlier in the year, and
indicators point to a much deeper contraction in early 2009. Headline inflation has fallen
sharply, due in part to collapsing oil prices.
•
Financial market volatility. The global financial crisis sparked volatility and pushed
credit and money-market spreads to unprecedented highs (Figure 4), although spreads are
below foreign levels. Similarly, bank risk indicators have risen but are below comparable
levels abroad (Figure 5).1 Meanwhile, pensions and insurers have been hit by U.S. mortgagerelated writedowns and the equity crash (Figure 6).
•
Plunging commodity prices. Commodity prices have retreated steeply from all-time
highs, postponing energy investments, fostering the first current account deficit in a decade,
undercutting growth in resource-rich western provinces, and deflating Western housing

markets. Reflecting the gyrations in commodity prices, the Canadian dollar fell from above
parity with the U.S. dollar in early 2008 to around four-year lows of 0.82 by end-2008.
3.
In response, macroeconomic policies have adopted an expansionary tilt and
authorities have taken steps to safeguard financial stability. Since December 2007, the
Bank of Canada has cut its policy rate by 400 basis points to ½ percent, a historic low, and
expanded liquidity through enhanced facilities. In January 2009, the authorities tabled the
2009 federal budget with a fiscal stimulus of 2.8 percent of GDP. The authorities have also
launched facilities to offer guarantees on wholesale borrowing for banks and insurance
companies, purchased mortgage-backed securities to ease liquidity pressures, and introduced
additional tools to preserve financial stability if needed (Table 1).
4.
Looking ahead, policies should focus on managing the downside risks to growth
and financial stability. Given the rapidly deteriorating global environment, domestic
economic activity will likely decline further in the near term, before picking up on the back
of the policy stimulus already in train. To dampen the downturn and hedge deflation risks,
the current accommodative monetary stance should be maintained until economic recovery is
firmly underway. Fiscal room exists for further stimulus, if downside risks materialize. Given
the worrisome market indicators and macro-financial feedbacks, the contingency policies to
deal with worsened financial stress are appropriate, and authorities should stand ready to act
further, if needed. (A table in the Informational Annex summarizes past and current Fund
policy advice in areas that are not the focus of this report).

injections (banks have raised
capital in markets, albeit at elevated cost owing to higher global risk aversion). Key factors
behind this relatively strong performance were (Selected Issues, Chapter I):
•
Sound supervision and regulation: The 2008 FSSA Update found that the regulatory
and supervisory framework meets best practice in many dimensions, including with regard to
the revised Basel Core Principles for banking supervision.

5
•
Stringent capital requirements: Solvency standards apply to banks’ consolidated
commercial and securities operations. Tier 1 capital generally significantly exceeds the
required 7 percent target (which in turn exceeds the Basel Accord minimum of 4 percent).
The leverage ratio is limited to 5 percent of total capital (Box 1).
•
Low risk tolerance and conservative balance sheet structures: Banks have a
profitable and stable domestic retail market, and (like their customers) exhibit low risk
tolerance. Banks had smaller exposures to “toxic” structured assets and relied less on volatile
wholesale funding than many international peers.
•
Conservative residential mortgage markets: Only 5 percent of mortgages are nonprime and only 25 percent are securitized (compared with 25 percent and 60 percent,
respectively, in the United States). Almost half of residential loans are guaranteed, while the
remaining have a loan-to-value ratio (LTV) below 80 percent—mortgages with LTV above
this threshold must be insured for the full loan amount (rather than the portion above
80 percent LTV, as in the United States). Also mortgage interest is nondeductible,
encouraging borrowers to repay quickly (Selected Issues, Chapter II).
•
Regulation reviews: To keep pace with financial innovation, federal authorities
review financial sector legislation every five years (Ontario has a similar process for
securities market legislation).
•
Effective coordination between supervisory agencies: Officials meet regularly in the
context of the Financial Institutions Supervisory Committee (FISC) and other fora to discuss
issues and exchange information on financial stability matters.2
•
Proactive response to financial strains: The authorities have expanded liquidity
facilities, provided liability guarantees, and purchased mortgage-backed securities. In
addition, several provinces now provide unlimited deposit insurance for provinciallyregulated credit unions. The 2009 Budget further expands support to credit markets, while
providing authority for public capital injections and other transactions to support financial
stability.
6.
Nevertheless, the global turbulence has had noticeable effects on Canada’s
financial markets. In mid-2007, Canada’s non-bank asset-backed commercial paper
(ABCP) market froze (a restructuring agreement was brokered in January 2009).3 During

The market for non-bank ABCP, which represented about one-third of the C$116 billion pre-crisis Canadian
ABCP market, shut down in August 2007 when issuers were unable to roll over their maturing paper, and the
backstop liquidity providers refused to advance funds (see the 2008 Canada Article IV staff report for more

2008, the nonperforming assets of the "big six" banks doubled to C$10.2 billion and chargeoffs increased by a third to C$5 billion (yet representing just 0.3 and 0.2 percent of total
assets, respectively). Bank profits remained positive (C$3 billion total for the “big six” in
the first quarter of 2009), albeit 20 percent down from a year ago.4 Strains were most
evident among non-banks, including life insurers, pension funds, and mutual funds
(Figure 6). Major financial institutions maintain fairly strong ratings, some with negative
outlooks.

Credit flows held up well through

the turn of the year but have ebbed more
recently (Figure 7). Credit has been
supported as banks have moved to fill gaps
left by retrenching securities markets and
finance companies. However, lending
standards have tightened, with the net
percentage of respondents reporting
tightening in lending standards at a record
high in the fourth quarter of 2008 (since data
collection began in 1999), and new credit
growth has slowed recently. Banks have
asked for new financial instruments to be counted as regulatory capital, suggesting that
capital could constrain lending. These factors point to a continued deceleration of lending,
with knock-on effects to growth (staff analysis shows that lending standards affect economic
activity with a lag; Selected Issues Chapter

While corporate balance sheets are stronger than households’, debt and commercial

Ongoing falls in house prices, particularly in the West (which experienced a housingprice bubble; Selected Issues Chapter IV), will continue to crimp residential

demand is expected to significantly
lower growth and dampen price
pressures. The staff’s baseline forecast
is for a sharp contraction in real GDP in
2009—the worst since 1981 when GDP
plunged by 2.9 percent—followed by a
return to positive growth in 2010.
Output would shrink through the first
half of 2009, rebounding with fiscal
stimulus. Staff models find that the U.S.
downturn will be the largest drag on
growth, followed by tighter financial conditions. House-price deflation will pose headwinds,
although overheating has been regional rather than national (Selected Issues Chapter IV).5
Weak commodity prices would prolong the recession, consistent with the experience in other
commodity exporters (Selected Issues

slack, headline inflation will be about zero on average in 2009, remaining well below the
Bank of Canada’s inflation target range of 1–3 percent before rising gradually to 2 percent by
early 2012. That said, medium-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at around
2 percent.
11.
At the time of the mission, the authorities’ projections were less pessimistic than
staff’s. January forecasts published by the Bank of Canada and Finance (the latter based on
private forecasts adjusted for risk) have higher growth in 2010 than staff’s projections. The
differences mainly reflect negative data (for both Canada and globally) released since
January, and staff’s below-consensus outlook for U.S. growth.
12.
Downside risks prevail. Larger negative spillovers would occur if U.S. real and
financial conditions are worse than staff’s current forecast, entailing risks of weaker growth,
as well as more prolonged low inflation or deflation (a tail risk under the baseline). Financial
instability in Canada is another tail risk, which would erode household and business
confidence and credit flows, undercutting consumption and investment spending, with
repercussions abroad (Box 2). House prices could also decline by more than expected. A
larger than expected recovery in commodity prices would improve domestic demand via
wealth effects, and act as an upside risk to both growth and prices.

II. POLICY RESPONSES
Discussions focused on policies to deal with risks and vulnerabilities to the economic and
financial stability outlook. Monetary and fiscal stimulus in train will support economic
activity and minimize tail risks of significant deflationary pressures, and monetary policy
should remain accommodative until recovery is firmly underway. Systemic financial
instability is a tail risk. Nevertheless, heightened vigilance and readiness to deploy newlyformulated tools to support financial stability are warranted, to forestall worsening adverse
macro-financial feedback.

A. Monetary Policy: Warding Off Deflation Risks
13.
Staff welcomed the monetary easing undertaken so far, and agreed with the
authorities that maintaining an accommodative stance would be appropriate. Continued
communication about the price stability outlook and the downside risks to inflation would
signal a commitment to maintain an easy stance as long as needed to avoid an undershooting
of inflation and inflation expectations. Indeed, recent measures from the Bank of Canada
have gone beyond traditional open market and discount window operations, which along
with the government’s mortgage-backed securities purchase program, have entailed elements
of unconventional easing. Bank officials noted that they are working on refining the
monetary policy framework (in time for the BoC’s April Monetary Policy Report) with a
view to using quantitative easing measures, if needed.6 However, the authorities emphasized
that monetary policy in Canada is highly effective: medium-term inflation expectations are
well-anchored and the monetary transmission mechanism functions smoothly because banks
are stable. Bank officials also stressed that they will continue to monitor carefully economic
and financial developments to evaluate the measures required to meet the 2-percent inflation
target over the medium term. That said, they saw deflationary risks as quite low.7

Staff supported the Bank’s floating exchange rate policy, noting that the
currency has served as an effective “shock absorber.” The authorities reiterated their

Recent quantitative easing measures in the United States and the United Kingdom have lowered long-term
Treasury bond yields, as seen in the text chart.

The mission and authorities also discussed possible changes to Canada’s inflation-control target, up for review
in 2011. The authorities and staff noted some space for marginal changes to the successful framework.
However, dealing with the effects of the crisis is appropriately the priority.

policy of letting markets determine the exchange rate. They observed that currency
interventions were generally ineffective in developed-country markets, and for Canada would
be reserved for countering disorderly market conditions. They pointed to the adjustment in
the Canadian dollar in recent years as evidence of its flexibility, noting that around two-thirds
of the recent depreciation was explained by the plunge in commodity prices. Staff’s CGER
exercise puts the Canadian dollar at near equilibrium (Box 3).8
B. Safeguarding Financial Stability to Underpin Growth
15.
Staff welcomed the authorities’ proactive response to financial strains. The
authorities have responded to market-specific stresses and enhanced their toolkit for dealing
with financial instability, notably in Budget 2009. Authorities noted that many of the
measures are precautionary, while some—particularly guarantees on bank liabilities—have
been adopted in part to level the international playing field.
16.

Measures include:

•

Provision of liquidity through enhanced Term Purchase-and-Resale Agreements by
the Bank of Canada, including at longer terms, for a wider set of counterparties, and
with a broader range of accepted collateral;

•

Facilities to guarantee bank and insurance liabilities under the Canadian Lenders
Assurance Facility (CLAF) and Canadian Life Insurance Assurance Facility (CLIAF)
(none yet drawn);

•

Purchases of insured mortgages to boost bank liquidity and support housing finance;

•

Purchases of securities backed by automobile loans and equipment leases through the
Canadian Secured Credit Facility to bolster financing for businesses and consumers
(to become operational shortly);

•

Greater resources for Export Development Canada and the Business Development
Bank of Canada to raise financing for corporations;

•

Increased collaboration between financial Crown corporations and private sector
lenders and insurers under the new Business Credit Availability Program to ease
credit constraints for creditworthy businesses;

8

While the crisis has pushed the current account into deficit for the first time since 1998, low external debt
implies minimal risks to external stability.

11
•

Additional tools for the Canadian Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC), including
ability to establish a bridge bank and own shares in member financial institutions; and
a boost in its borrowing limit from C$6 billion to C$15 billion;

•

Broader authority for the Minister of Finance to maintain financial stability via
various financial operations (including capital injections).

17.
The mission noted that the ongoing Canadian credit cycle and risks to
international financial stability pointed to a need for continued vigilance (Box 4). Staff
advised close supervisory attention to bank exposures to U.S. assets. Authorities clarified that
most U.S. operations are in the retail sector; while these exposures would be affected by the
U.S. downturn, banks have already provisioned or taken write-downs against specific
concentrated exposures. They also noted that an intensification in the turmoil in the auto
industry would mostly affect banks via declining economic activity, given their limited direct
exposure. The mission further advised vigilance on exposures to commodity-affected sectors,
non-banks (especially insurers and pension plans), and households, with a particular focus on
cross-institution spillovers and macroprudential risks related to high household debt. The
mission saw close cooperation among supervisors as especially useful, given that Canada’s
financial system is dominated by a few large and highly interconnected players. Cooperation
between federal and provincial supervisors would be important as well, as certain institutions
(like credit unions) were regulated at the provincial level.
18.
Officials expressed cautious confidence in financial stability, underpinned by a
conservative financial system structure, effective supervision, and relatively strong
underlying fundamentals. That said, they saw no room for complacency, and would remain
watchful for signs of instability. They saw the existing system of regulation and resolution as
effective (including for non-banks), with the federal authorities supervising all systemically
important financial institutions, and capable of dealing with contingencies (also noting that
stress tests undertaken under the FSSA had proven useful in thinking through risks). In
addition, banks maintain capital ratios well above Basel standards. They agreed that
cooperation between federal and provincial supervisors was essential, noting that
communication lines are open, and saw provincial regulators as rigorous as federal ones.
19.
Staff supported authorities’ plans to move toward centralized securities
supervision, in line with recommendations of an Expert Panel on Securities Regulation
and longstanding Fund advice. Budget 2009 noted the authorities’ intentions to follow the
Expert Panel’s recommendations, and table a national securities act this year to lay the
groundwork for a national regulator, which could become operational by Fall 2011.9 Staff
noted that the current passport system of 13 provincial and territorial securities supervisors
risks regulatory arbitrage and creates gaps in oversight, given that securities markets are

defined-benefit pension plans.10
Staff and authorities agreed that these measures, while helpful, give only temporary relief,
and the authorities plan to enact pension reforms (including on solvency funding rules) by
end-2009. Looking beyond the current cycle, it seems likely that guaranteed insurance
products and defined benefit plans will play smaller roles than in the past due to their
substantial exposure to market risk, which questions the sustainability of these arrangements
in volatile periods.
21.
Staff also welcomed the measures to protect the long-term stability of Canada's
housing market. Along with increased funding to mortgage markets, the Canada Mortgage
Bond (CMB) program was expanded to include a CMB with a 10-year maturity to attract
new investors seeking assets beyond the current five-year term; two issues, the most recent
on February 18, have provided an additional C$4.5 billion in liquidity to financial
institutions. The government also moved to reduce the maximum loan amortization period
from 40 to 35 years, and to require down payments of at least five percent for federallyinsured mortgages.
C. Fiscal Actions Within a Strong Framework
22.
The economic downturn coupled with fiscal stimulus will break an 11-year
string of federal surpluses. Canada’s strong framework based on budgetary discipline and

effectively national in scope. A federal regulator could coordinate more readily with other
regulators in monitoring risks and responding quickly to a crisis, and could also have an
enhanced focus on the issues that securities markets may pose for national financial stability.

13
conservative forecasting has more than halved the net federal debt/GDP ratio in 10 years.
Since 2006, the authorities have targeted an annual reduction of C$3 billion in federal
government debt (0.2 percent of GDP), aiming to bring federal debt (now at around
29 percent of GDP) to 25 percent by 2011−12. However, fiscal stimulus and the recession
will foster deficits and delay achieving the 25-percent-of-GDP debt target.

Notably, the January
stimulus relies mainly on infrastructure spending, and support to vulnerable sectors
(including housing) and provinces. It boosts safety nets, thus protecting the most vulnerable;
provides training to facilitate job reallocation; and allows automatic stabilizers to be given
full play. It also provides permanent tax relief, particularly to low- and middle-income
households. Finally, the budget cuts external tariffs, in line with Canada’s long-standing
commitment to trade liberalization and openness. In this regard, the authorities noted their
concern with “Buy American” provisions in the latest U.S. budget proposal, indicating that
the NAFTA procurement provisions for free trade do not apply at the provincial/state level.

24.
The near-term focus is on implementing the current stimulus package. The
framework for quarterly monitoring of budget deployment (first review was completed in

14
mid-March) will promote maximum effectiveness and provide opportunities to assess both
implementation and impact. Authorities and staff agreed that the challenge would be to
ensure the speedy and effective implementation of infrastructure projects, most of which will
be undertaken at the subnational level. Authorities aim at having the bulk of the 2009
stimulus available for implementation as early as April, when they are legally allowed to use
resources in Budget 2009. They also pointed to a “use it or lose it” clause aimed to ensure
that all the spending is completed by end-FY2010.
25.
The mission observed that fiscal room exists for further action, should it be
needed if downside risks materialize. Staff saw the fiscal response as appropriate given
Canada’s situation. However, because of Canada’s enviable fiscal position (the lowest debt to
GDP ratio in the G-7 and among the lowest 10-year bond yields among industrial countries),
and despite fiscal risks (Box 5), further stimulus would be feasible if needed. In particular,
Canada would be well positioned to join in a further round of coordinated stimulus with other
countries.
26.
The mission discussed the limits to potential additional stimulus, although these
were not seen as presently binding.Infrastructure spending had been sharply increased and
would at some point face implementation constraints; larger permanent tax cuts could put at
risk the underlying fiscal position; and temporary tax cuts would have limited effectiveness.
The mission and the authorities agreed that automatic stabilizers should be given full play,
and also concurred that Canada could join in further internationally coordinated stimulus, if
needed, observing that coordination would reduce leakages from a further domestic fiscal
impulse.
27.
The mission welcomed the authorities’ commitment to medium-term fiscal
prudence and debt reduction. In this connection, Budget 2009 noted the aim to avoid longterm structural deficits. Officials stressed their commitment to spending discipline (notably,
caps on the public wage bill as in Budget 2009), including by limiting program spending
once economic recovery is underway. The mission observed that this commitment to
prudence, along with a strong track record of budgetary responsibility, underpinned Canada’s
fiscal credibility. Staff and the authorities agreed that the considerable uncertainty
surrounding the outlook complicated setting numerical debt targets at present. Targets could
be recalibrated when the outlook is clearer, further bolstering fiscal credibility.11 The mission
also welcomed the creation of the Parliamentary Budget Office with a mandate to support the
work of parliamentary committees.

11

Medium-term targets would need to account for health care costs, which have been growing in real terms by
4.7 percent annually since 2000, and are expected to rise further as population aging intensifies (in 2001, one in
eight Canadians were seniors; this will rise to one in six in 2021 and one in four in 2041).

III. STAFF APPRAISAL
28.
Canada is better positioned than many countries to weather the crisis. It entered
the crisis from a position of strength, reflecting a track record of strong policy management
that has supported underlying macroeconomic and financial stability. It has taken proactive
steps to stimulate demand, ward off deflation, and enhance the toolkit for dealing with
worsening financial strains if they emerge. Thanks to these factors, the strains evident in
other countries, especially in the financial sector, are markedly less serious in Canada.
29.
Nevertheless, Canada faces a challenging period ahead in light of the sharp
deterioration in the global environment and its strong international linkages.
Employment, income, and investment will come under substantial pressure, with output
recovering only as the full effects of policy stimulus are felt. With economic slack widening,
core inflation will ebb to low levels. Downside risks still predominate, including negative
spillovers to Canada if the global environment worsens more than expected. Accordingly, the
key policy priorities are continued vigilance and readiness to respond if tail risks are realized.
30.
Monetary policy should remain accommodative until disinflationary pressures
abate. The aggressive monetary easing and expanded BoC facilities are justified by the
subpar economic outlook and liquidity pressures. Going forward, maintaining an easy stance
will limit downside risks to inflation and inflation expectations. The latter can also be
managed through continued clear communication of the commitment to price stability.

16
Unconventional measures could help to reinforce this commitment, if downside risks
materialize.
31.
Fiscal policy has provided significant stimulus and authorities are rightly
focused on implementation. The January stimulus package was appropriately sized,
diversified, and structured, and included steps to facilitate labor reallocation and protect
Canada’s most vulnerable. Provincial stimulus will add to the ameliorating effects of federal
measures. Moreover, the new quarterly monitoring framework will maximize the
effectiveness of fiscal actions by providing opportunities to assess both their implementation
and the prevailing economic environment. In addition, the move to liberalize the trade regime
by lowering tariffs is welcome.
32.
Canada’s sound fiscal situation would allow for further expansionary measures
if they became necessary. With debt low, Canada would be well positioned to participate in
a globally coordinated round of further stimulus. Meanwhile, automatic stabilizers can be
given full play. Further fiscal expansion would not put at risk debt sustainability, in view of
the credible commitment to medium-term structural surpluses. Looking beyond the crisis,
debt targets could be recalibrated once the outlook becomes clearer; in the meantime, fiscal
credibility could be supported by continuing to signal the commitment to medium-term
consolidation.
33.
Canada’s financial stability amid the turbulence bears testimony to effective
supervision and regulation. Rigorous limits on leverage and targeted capital ratios well
above Basel standards have helped to avoid vulnerabilities. In addition, five-year reviews
have ensured that federal regulatory legislation is modernized periodically, while regular
interaction among officials has supported the smooth exchange of information needed to
preserve financial stability.
34.
Consolidating and enhancing securities regulation would further strengthen the
already robust financial stability framework. Over time, bringing a greater financial
stability focus to securities regulation, and achieving broader national integration, would
provide a more holistic perspective to financial stability arrangements. The intention
expressed in Budget 2009 to follow the recommendations of the Expert Panel on Securities
Regulation is an important step in the right direction.
35.
The challenging credit cycle ahead calls for vigilance to forestall an adverse
macro-financial feedback loop. The sharp economic downturn will continue to pressure
bank credit quality, with feedback onto tighter credit conditions, thus further dampening
economic activity. But proactive steps to safeguard financial stability, including by
augmenting the financial stability toolkit, will serve Canada well in containing this dynamic.
In addition, continued close consultation among federal supervisors and regulators could
focus on risks to individual institutions and cross-institution spillovers, and macro-prudential
risks related to high household debt. In addition, continued close cooperation between federal

17
and provincial supervisors would manage any potential spillovers between provincial and
national markets.
36.

It is recommended that the next consultation occur on the usual 12-month cycle.
Box 1. Canadian Bank Regulatory Capital Requirements: Are They Tougher?

Among the G7, only Canadian and U.S. bank regulators impose leverage caps. Elsewhere, two large Swiss
banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, will be subject to leverage caps in 2013 (Table 1).1 The Canadian leverage cap
is calculated on total (Tier 1 and 2) capital, and the U.S. cap on Tier 1 capital. OSFI includes some offbalance sheet exposures in its definition of assets, whereas the U.S. leverage calculation does not. (These offbalance sheet exposures include credit derivatives, financial standby letters of credit, guarantees, and surety
arrangements.)

a. Canadian specified off-balance sheet exposures include direct credit substitutes (see above), trade- and transaction-related
contingencies, and repurchase agreements.
b. The Swiss minimum leverage ratio (excluding domestic lending) will be 3 percent (at group level) and 4 percent (for the
individual institutions). The leverage ratio will be tighter in good times (most likely 4-5 percent). The determination of this
cyclical adjustment is not linked to macroeconomic conditions but the supervisory assessment once leverage increases above 20.
c. U.S. banks that meet certain criteria of strength and sophistication are subject to a 33 1/3 percent maximum leverage ratio. All
others are limited to 25 percent.

Canada’s minimum capital requirements are tougher than called for by Basel II, and all other G7 bank
regulators (Table 2). Canadian banks have to hold Tier 1 capital of at least 7 percent (versus 6 percent in the
United States) of risk-weighted (RWA) assets, and 10 percent (versus 8 percent in most other G7 countries)
of RWA as total capital.2

As part of their financial stabilization measures adopted in fall 2008, the Swiss financial market supervisor (FINMA)
introduced a minimum leverage ratio that adjusts to downturns—while acknowledging the need to avoid enhancing the
current downturn by tightening capital and other rules too early.

2

These comparisons do not account for potential differences in Tier 1 and 2 capital definitions from country to country,
although these are believed to be immaterial. Also, supervisors may impose undocumented higher capital requirements
on some banks (e.g., systemically important and/or large complex institutions).

The slowdown is likely to result in
significant aftershocks in many countries
that rely on Canadian remittances. With
Canada being among the main recipients of
immigrants in the world—accounting for
almost a fifth of its population—the current
slowdown could have important implications
on remittances and, thus, income in many
countries, including some economies already
under severe stress.

Canadian financial strains could also have repercussions abroad. Several Canadian banks have expanded
U.S. operations, while some institutions (such as Scotia, RBC, and CIBC) have large retail presences in the
Caribbean, holding about half of retail deposits in the Eastern Caribbean. A few banks also operate in Latin
America. The major insurers are among the world’s largest; Manulife, for example, is the largest insurance
company in North America by market capitalization and the fourth largest globally.

Box 3. Exchange Rate Assessment
Canada: Nominal and Real Effective Exchange Rate
The Canadian dollar has depreciated
(monthly percentage change)
considerably following the plunge in
commodity prices. The loonie is close
to a 4-year low against the U.S. dollar
while it is close to a 7-year low against
the Japanese yen—Canada’s third
largest trading partner after the United
States and the European Union.
Depreciation pressures started to emerge
in early 2008, driven partly by broadbased U.S. dollar strength amid
decreasing risk appetite. In effective
terms, the nominal and real exchange
rates have fallen by around 17 percent since early 2008, with most of the depreciation
occurring in the midst of the financial market turmoil.

The last time the Bank of Canada intervened in foreign exchange markets to affect
movements in the Canadian dollar was in September 1998. Prior to September 1998,
Canada's policy was to intervene systematically in the foreign exchange market to resist, in an
automatic fashion, significant upward or downward pressure on the Canadian dollar. Since
September 1998, however, the policy has changed and Canada intervenes in foreign exchange
markets on a discretionary basis.
Three approaches have been applied to assess the level of the Canadian dollar relative to
its medium-term equilibrium level, based on the estimates by the IMF’s Consultative Group
on Exchange Rate Issues (CGER) which provides exchange rate assessments for a number of
advanced and emerging economies from a multilateral perspective. The complementary
approaches are (i) the “macroeconomic balance” approach (MB) based on the gap between the
projected medium-term current account and a “CA norm” which takes into account the impact
of the oil trade balance, (ii) the reduced-form “equilibrium real exchange rate” approach
(ERER)—where the equilibrium RER is estimated as a function of the country’s medium-term
fundamentals (such as the net foreign asset (NFA) position, the relative productivity
differential between the tradable and nontradable sectors, and the terms of trade), and (iii) the
“external sustainability” approach (ES)—which calculates the difference between the actual
current account balance and the balance that would stabilize the NFA position of the country at
some benchmark level.1 The ERER approach is probably best suited to assessing Canada’s
currency, as it explicitly accounts for commodity price fluctuations.
According to these approaches, the Canadian dollar is estimated to be close to
equilibrium, based on exchange rates as of February 2009:
• According to the macroeconomic balance approach, the Canadian dollar is above
fundamentals by about 4 percent. This assessment hinges on an estimated current account
norm of around 0.9 percent of GDP; estimates of the norm are derived from a panel of 55
advanced and emerging economies over 1973−2006.

20
•
•

The external sustainability approach implies that the currency is about 6 percent below
fundamentals.
The equilibrium exchange rate approach—staff’s preferred approach for Canada—
suggests that the currency is at equilibrium, with the terms of trade, the productivity
differential, and net foreign assets as the main determinants.
Option-Implied Volatility for Canadian Dollar- U.S. Dollar Exchange Rate at Various Maturities

Nevertheless, derivative prices
imply increasing risk of large nearterm currency moves.
• Implied volatility—a measure of
market uncertainty—on
loonie/dollar option contracts is
significantly above past peaks at
short maturities.2
• That said, the term structure of
implied volatilities slopes
downward, suggesting less
uncertainty about exchange rate
moves over longer horizons.
• Forward CAD interest rates have
moved in line with the U.S.
dollar, and “risk reversals” put no
premium on Canadian dollar
appreciation versus the U.S.
dollar.

Implied volatility is an estimate of market uncertainty about future asset-price moves extracted from
option prices. If investors were risk neutral, implied volatility would be equal to the market estimate of
the standard deviation of asset price changes.

similar unemployment, and
pronounced U.S. deflation. The stress test anticipated bank losses of 2.5−3.5 percentage points
of capital. Extrapolating (by assuming that changes in the original stress test have a linear
impact on bank capital), the current macroeconomic outlook can result in losses of about 1 to
2 percentage points of capital.
FSSA Stress Test Assumptions Versus IMF Forecast

IMF baseline forecast:
contraction from second
half of 2008 and leveling in
second half of 2009

Corrections in housing prices could also cut bank capital by ½ to 1 percentage point in
two years. The FSSA presented a separate test (not additive to the results above) assuming
declines in real estate prices of 30 percent in Western Canada and 15 percent in Eastern
Canada, projecting bank losses of about 4 percentage points of capital. Staff currently estimates
that residential real estate in Canada is overvalued by about 7 percent in Western Canada, but
in line with fundamentals in Eastern Canada. Using the FSSA parameters, a housing correction
would lead to bank losses of about ½ to 1 percentage point of capital, taking into account a
possibility of modest price overshooting on the downside.
Under a stress scenario, banks could approach or breach national capital thresholds and
need to raise additional capital. As of February 2009, the six largest Canadian banks had tier
1 capital ratios above 9 percent (compared to the Basel Accord minimum of 4 percent and a
national target of 7 percent) and total capital ratios above 11 percent (compared to the Basel
Accord minimum of 8 percent and a national

Box 5. Fiscal Risks
There are increasing risks to the fiscal outlook, stemming from a more protracted recession and
deflation, worsening financial conditions, declining asset and commodity prices, and sectoral
problems.
•

Recession and deflation. Authorities’ calculations suggest that, if real GDP growth slows
by 1 percentage point, then the federal deficit would rise by C$3.1 billion (around one-fifth
of 1 percent of GDP). If GDP inflation is a percentage point lower, then Canada’s budget
deficit would be 0.1 percent of GDP higher.

•

Public support to financial sector. The preemptive measures undertaken to support
financial stability have had minimal fiscal impact thus far but represent contingent
liabilities. While the need for public capital injections appears remote, as institutions
remain solidly capitalized and have successfully raised private capital so far, this option
cannot be ruled out.

•

Rollover/liquidity squeeze. While staff analysis suggests that Canada’s medium-term public
net debt position will not exhibit stresses under various scenarios (e.g., lower growth
outcome than envisioned or increasing contingency liabilities), there is the risk that markets
may require higher interest rates if government bond supply increases sharply (although
alternatively, Canadian government bonds may benefit from “safe haven” flows). With
around half of net debt maturing within one year, near-term gross funding requirements are
rising in importance for Canada, although debt roll-over risks remain minimal.

•

Worsening pension plans performance. With investments in equities and mutual funds of
over 10 percent of GDP, large public and private pension funds are highly exposed to
financial turmoil. While the Canadian pension plan (CPP) is expected to rely only on
contributions until 2019 to pay benefits, the Quebec pension plan is under increasing
pressure after incurring a record loss of around US$7 billion (a fourth of its net assets) in
2008 on asset sales and writedowns tied to insolvent issuers of Canadian commercial paper.
The largest risk stems from a possible support for private pensions, given their rising
unfunded liabilities.

•

Asset and commodity price declines. Staff estimates for G-20 countries suggest that a
10 percent decline in equity prices decreases cyclically-adjusted revenues by 0.07 and
0.08 percent of GDP in the current and subsequent year, while a similar fall in real housing
prices decreases revenues by 0.27 percent of GDP in the following year. Canada would also
lose around ¾ percent of GDP in revenues due to the decline in commodity prices, with
increasing risks on corporate income taxes given the weakening business outlook.

•

Collapse of the automobile sector. The authorities (including the Government of Ontario)
have pledged about C$4 billion in loans to the automobile sector in 2009, representing a
contingent liability to the fiscal accounts in view of the large risks faced by the sector.

Annex I. Canada—Fund Policy Advice Not Discussed in the Staff Report
Issue
The Bank of Canada is contemplating shifting its target away
from annual inflation (IT) to a price level path (PLPT). The
benefits include reducing uncertainty about future price levels
and avoiding the price level drift that occurs under IT, which
tends to hurt agents who receive income fixed in nominal terms
or who are risk averse and enter into long-term, nominal
contracts (e.g. home mortgages).
High marginal effective rates (METRs) on capital, saving, and
labor income.
The agreement to lock in federal health transfers over the next
10 years provides provinces with opportunities to improve the
efficiency and quality of health care.

Staff Position
Monetary Policy
Canada’s current IT framework has been very successful, at the
same time Canada may already be reaping some of the benefits
of price level targeting in terms of anchoring expectations about
the future price level. Thus benefits of a formal shift to PLPT
should be weighed against the costs of abandoning an effective
and credible IT framework.
Fiscal Policy
Harmonizing remaining provincial sales taxes with the GST
base, including by providing explicit incentives to provinces to
move towards that direction; protecting all types of saving from
taxes up to a cap, and supporting wealth creation by moving
personal income taxes closer to a consumption tax; further
lowering METR on labor income.
Allowing provinces greater flexibility in using price and other
market-based mechanisms could help align the demand and
supply for health care and reduce costs over time.

Authorities’ Position
Since the introduction of IT, a unique combination of
shocks has aligned Canada’s inflation (on average at the
2-percent target) to the outcome of a PLPT regime. This
minimizes credibility risks from a regime switch, but BoC is
still studying the possible gains of such move and it does
not plan changes to the IT regime before the 2011 review.
Willing to work with the remaining provinces on
harmonization—Ontario has signed a Memorandum of
Agreement with the federal government to join the
Harmonized Sales Tax Framework in July 2010; creation
of the Tax Savings Account for up to C$5,000, effective in
2009; provided significant personal tax relief since 2006,
including increasing the basic personal amount, raising the
income level at which the National Child Benefit
supplement for low-income families is fully phased out and
the income level at which the base benefit of the Canada
Child Tax Benefit begins to be phased out.
The Canada Health Act allows for private service delivery,
and provinces are actively exploring different approaches
to improve competition. Even low user fees could reduce
access to health care by the poor.

Canada maintains an Employment Insurance System that offers
generous seasonal, regional, and family leave benefits, funded
by payroll tax.
Canada can play an important role in the Doha negotiations.
Barriers to interprovincial trade and labor mobility hamper
competition and innovation, while stringent FDI review process
might hinder international investment.

Financial Policy
The short-term debt loophole that was exploited by non-bank
ABCP issuers should be closed.

Provincial regulators have proposed amending the shortterm debt exemption so that it is unavailable to ABCP.

2

The distribution of ABCP is exempt from securities regulators'
registration and prospectus requirements, which may have
contributed to the damage caused by the seizure of the thirdparty ABCP market.

Labor Markets
Consideration could be given to funding social benefits of the
Employment Insurance System through general revenues and
to curbing extended regional benefits.
Trade Policy
Canada needs to widen market access for agricultural goods,
including those subject to “supply management” schemes
Freeing mobility in goods, services and regulated professions
between all provinces along the lines of the Trade, Investment
and Labor Mobility Agreement (TILMA) between Alberta and
British Columbia. Remove stringent rules in FDI flows.

Recent reforms to the Employment Insurance System
have improved its funding. No significant changes in
benefits are currently being considered, apart from the
temporary extension by 5 weeks given the downturn.
Canada remains committed to a successful completion of
the Doha round; though it will continue to support supply
management schemes. Canada has also been pursuing
bilateral free trade agreements, more recently with
Colombia and Peru.
In January 2009, the First Ministers agreed on a full labor
mobility by April 2009, and the federal government has
streamlined immigration procedures. The Ministers also
agreed to identify priority areas for progress on
harmonizing business regulations and standards.
Revisions to the Investment Act along the
recommendations of the Competition Policy Review Panel
are under way.

Exchange Rate Arrangements: The Canadian authorities do not maintain margins
with respect to exchange transactions. The Canadian dollar is a freely floating currency, with
exchange rates determined on the basis of demand and supply conditions in the foreign
exchange market. However, the authorities may intervene to maintain orderly conditions in
the exchange market. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign
exchange. Canada has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4(a) and
maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers for current international transactions. Canada maintains exchange restrictions for
security reasons, based on UN Security Council Resolutions, that have been notified to the
Fund for approval (most recently in December 2007) under the procedures set forth in
Executive Board Decision No. 144-(52/51).

February 23-March 3 by C. Kramer (head), M. Estevão, R. Duttagupta, E. Tsounta,
L. Ratnovski (all WHD), and J. Kiff (MCM). An advance mission team visited Alberta in
December 2008. Mr. St-Amant (Senior Advisor) attended the meetings. Mr. Eyzaguirre
(WHD) and Mr. Horgan (Executive Director) participated in the concluding meeting with
Minister of Finance Flaherty and Bank of Canada Senior Deputy Governor Jenkins in Ottawa
on March 9. A press conference was held on March 11. Outreach included discussions with
the private sector, labor unions, academics, and think tanks.

FSSA Participation and ROSC Assessments

Canada–Financial System Stability Assessment–
Volume II: Report on Observance of Standards
in the Financial System

(www.imf.org)

Summary: The FSSA report concluded that Canada has a stable and highly advanced
financial system, which is among the soundest in the world. Moreover, it is supported
by a well-developed regulatory system that shows a high degree of compliance with
major international standards. Nevertheless, the FSSA report made a few
recommendations to further strengthen the regulatory framework and financial
system’s resilience, most of which have already been addressed, including:
•

Introducing capital requirements for the guarantees in life insurance
segregated fund (completed by end-2001);

•

Tabling legislation granting the Office of the Superintendent of Financial
Institutions (OSFI) powers to remove a financial institution’s director or
senior officer if the person is deemed not suitable to hold that office based on
a number of criteria. The latter legislation brought Canada into broad
compliance with the Basel Core Principles;

Making significant progress in harmonizing securities regulation and improving
coordination among provincial securities regulators, including through a newly
created association of securities regulators, the Canadian Securities Administrators.
Although there remain multiple regulators at the provincial level, a Senate
commission was created to develop specific recommendations on further
harmonization and streamlining of securities regulation.

Canada: Report on the Observance of Standards
and Codes—Fiscal Transparency Module

IMF Country Report
No. 02/51, 03/12/02

Summary: The report found that fiscal management in Canada meets the
requirements of the fiscal transparency code, and in a number of instances represents
best practice. In particular, it highlighted the use of private sector economic forecasts.
Fiscal management was also commended for its statistical integrity, impartial tax
administration, open procurement, and a transparent regulatory process.
The report found several areas where further improvements would be desirable,
including: (i) the preparation of timely, current year estimates of federal and
provincial budgets on a comparable basis, (ii) a comprehensive account of the
procedures for the budget cycle and expenditure management system, (iii) systematic
reporting of the use of reserves for non-economic contingencies, (iv) resumption of
publication of reconciled national and public accounts forecasts of major aggregates
over the forecast horizon, and (v) publication by all governments of quasi-fiscal
activities.
Many of these issues have been addressed, including: (i) the release by Statistics
Canada of consolidated data for federal and provincial budgets for 2001–02 (on a
Financial Management System basis); (ii) the publication of comprehensive
descriptions of budget and expenditure management procedures, including a joint
document entitled “Budgeting in Canada” by the Government and the OECD, detailed
accounts of policies and procedures on expenditure management at the website of the
Treasury Board Secretariat, and the explanation of the budget cycle and process in
Budget and Update documents; and (iii) publication of reconciled national and public
accounts forecasting.
Canada: Report on the Observance of Standards
and Codes—Data Module

IMF Country Report
No. 03/328, 10/23/03

Summary: Canada’s macroeconomic statistics are comprehensive, timely, and
accurate and thus adequate to conduct effective surveillance of economic and
financial policies. Official institutions responsible for the compilation and
dissemination of the macroeconomic datasets are supported by adequate legal and
institutional frameworks. These frameworks protect confidentiality and ensure that
statistical work is conducted within a quality assurance program and with sufficient
resources. Integrity is ensured by the professionalism of the staff, transparency in
statistical policies and practices, and the provision of ethical guidelines for staff.
Compilers generally follow internationally accepted guidelines in the production of
the macroeconomic statistics, which is well-supported by excellent efforts to develop
source data that facilitate a high degree of accuracy and reliability. Statistics are
generally relevant, well documented, available with good frequency on a timely basis,
and readily accessible to users, who trust them as objective.

While recognizing the high quality of the macroeconomic data, the report makes
recommendations to further strengthen the statistical system, most of which are
already being addressed, including these priorities:
•

Articulate the roles of Statistics Canada and the Bank of Canada in producing
financial sector statistics and explore possibilities for more data sharing of
monetary and financial statistics;

•

Estimate consumption of fixed capital at replacement cost rather than historic
costs now used for the corporate sector in the Canadian System of National
Accounts (CSNA);

•

Disseminate information on the sources and methods used in compiling quarterly
public sector statistics for the quarterly CSNA; and

•

Reclassify certain transactions that are not recorded in line with the 5th edition of
the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5).

and Codes––FATF Recommendations for AntiMoney Laundering and Combating the
Financing of Terrorism
Summary: Canada underwent a detailed FATF evaluation of its anti-money
laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) framework in 2007.
Shortcomings were identified with respect to the scope of customer due diligence,
AML/CFT supervision, and the Canadian financial intelligence unit. Since then, a
number of steps have been taken to strengthen the framework in these three areas,
resulting in significant improvements.

Canada: Financial System Stability AssessmentNo. 08/59, 02/13/08
Update
Summary: The FSSA update concluded that Canada’s financial system is mature,
sophisticated, and well-managed. Financial stability was underpinned by sound
macroeconomic policies and strong prudential regulation and supervision, and welldesigned deposit insurance and arrangements for crisis management and failure
resolution. The banking system appeared sound, with stress tests showing that the
major banks could withstand sizeable shocks, although they did faces some
challenges related to the global financial turmoil that started in mid-2007. Also, there
were some concerns about bank attempts to build on their secure domestic position, to
enter highly competitive foreign markets or complex activities.
The update reiterated the advantages of moving towards a single securities regulator,
including the streamlining of policy development, reductions in compliance costs, and
improved enforcement. However, it also recognized the significant improvements to

7
the regulatory system from the creation of the Canadian Securities Administrators
(CSA), and the implementation of the passport system.

Annex III. Statistical Issues
The quality, coverage, periodicity, and timeliness of Canada’s economic data are considered
to be excellent both in the context of the Article IV consultation and for purposes of ongoing
surveillance. Canada has subscribed to the Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard
(SDDS), and its metadata are posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board
(DSBB).
Real Sector. Statistics Canada provides timely and adequate data in monthly, quarterly, and
annual frequency thereby facilitating the analysis of economic developments and assessment
of policy proposals within a quantitative macroeconomic framework. In May 2001, Statistics
Canada effected a smooth transition from Laspeyres methodology for estimating real
expenditure-based GDP to Fisher index formulae, which enabled more accurate comparison
between Canada and other G-7 countries.
Fiscal Sector. The Department of Finance Canada provides monthly and annual data on the
federal government’s budget, tax policies, rules and regulations for Canada’s banks and other
financial institutions. The provided data enable adequate assessment of the impact of fiscal
policy measures on Canada’s economic performance.
Monetary Sector. The Bank of Canada provides timely and adequate coverage of daily,
weekly, monthly and quarterly data related to the monetary sector.
External Sector. Statistics Canada provides timely information on a quarterly frequency on
the balance of payments, external debt, and the international investment position (IIP).
Finance Canada provides monthly data on Official International Reserves in a format
comparable to the IMF’s reserve data template, thus enabling adequate surveillance. Data are
published at http://www.fin.gc.ca/finsearch/finresults_e.asp?Who=News.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2009 Article IV Consultation with
Canada
On May 11, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Canada. 1
Background
Canada entered the crisis on a solid footing, reflecting a strong macroeconomic framework,
rigorous financial regulation, and robust corporate balance sheets. Through 2007, sound
macroeconomic and financial policies along with a commodity boom delivered strong growth,
stable inflation, fiscal and current account surpluses, historically low unemployment and
financial stability. But nevertheless, the crisis has significantly affected Canada's economic and
financial conditions, given its openness to trade and financial flows.
Real GDP contracted by 3.4 percent (seasonally adjusted annual rate) in the fourth quarter of
2008 after a weak performance earlier in the year, driven by a 5-percent decline in domestic
demand as the terms of trade, credit conditions, equity prices, and employment deteriorated
abruptly. Net external trade contributed positively to growth, as imports plummeted more than
exports. The economy contracted further in early 2009, reflecting the sharp downturn in the
United States and further tightening of financial conditions, but is expected to rebound
moderately later in the year boosted by fiscal and monetary stimulus. GDP is projected to fall
2½ percent year-over-year in 2009 before recovering somewhat at a 1.2-percent rate in 2010.
Unemployment is expected to reach a 10-year high of around 9¼ percent in mid-2010, while

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
the increasing output gap should dampen price pressures, with headline inflation averaging
about zero in 2009.
In late 2008, Canada’s current account position turned negative, for the first time in a decade,
as the terms of trade fell by over 30 percent (seasonally adjusted annual rate) and real exports
plummeted by about 20 percent (saar). The latter largely reflected both a sharp deterioration in
manufacturing trade in response to the U.S. downturn and the impact of past currency
appreciation. The Canadian dollar has served as an effective shock absorber, following trends
in commodity prices: a 35-percent appreciation in real effective terms during boom years (2002
to 2007) and a 12-percent depreciation in the fourth quarter of 2008.
The Bank of Canada (BoC) has cut policy rates by 425 basis points since December 2007 to
¼ percent—a historic low and an effective lower bound—and expanded liquidity through
enhanced facilities. The BoC has committed to keep the policy interest rate at its current level
through the end of the second quarter in 2010 (conditional on the inflation outlook), and
increased the length of its repo facilities. It has also announced a framework for quantitative
and credit easing, to be deployed if downside risks to growth materialize. The need for these
unconventional measures would be assessed at each monetary policy meeting, with due
attention to risks to the Bank’s balance sheet and the exit strategy.
Building on the permanent tax relief measures announced in October 2007, the authorities
tabled further fiscal stimulus of around 2.8 percent of GDP in January 2009. Taking into
account supplementary provincial actions announced following the federal budget, the
measures are among the largest across G-20 countries. The stimulus relies mainly on
infrastructure spending, support to the vulnerable sectors, enhanced social safety nets and
retraining programs for job reallocation, and tax reductions and incentives. Its deployment is
being monitored via quarterly parliamentary reviews. The package and the economic downturn
will end an 11-year string of fiscal surpluses, which allowed Canada to achieve the lowest
debt-to-GDP ratio among G-7 countries.
The financial system has avoided systemic pressures amid the global turbulence, thanks in
good part to strong supervision and regulation. No institution has failed or required public
capital injection, and banks have raised capital in markets (albeit at an elevated cost). Despite
this resilience, the crisis has widened interbank spreads, credit conditions have tightened, and
borrowing costs have risen significantly. Meanwhile, the plunge in equity markets has put
strains on life insurers, pension funds and mutual funds. However, since the beginning of the
year financial conditions have generally improved in Canada.
The authorities have taken proactive steps to safeguard financial stability. They have launched
facilities to offer guarantees on wholesale borrowing for banks and insurance companies, and
purchased mortgage-backed securities to ease liquidity pressures, and announced additional
support to certain credit markets. In addition, the authorities have obtained the mandate for
public capital injections and for the creation of a bridge bank by the Canadian Deposit
Insurance Corporation, if needed.

3
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended Canada’s impressive macroeconomic track record, strong
policy framework and proactive response to the crisis. These factors place Canada in a better
position than most countries to weather the global financial crisis, and the financial strains
evident elsewhere are markedly less serious in Canada. Directors observed, however, that the
near-term economic outlook will be challenging in light of the sharp deterioration in the global
environment and Canada’s strong international linkages. They saw risks, including from
macro-financial linkages, as tilted to the downside, and called for continued vigilance and
readiness to act, if tail risks materialize.
Against this background, Directors welcomed the Bank of Canada’s aggressive monetary
easing, expanded facilities, and the recently announced framework for the conduct of
monetary policy at low interest rates. They concurred that maintaining a highly accommodative
stance in the foreseeable future would limit downside risks to economic growth and inflation,
while continuing to support financial stability. Directors saw continued clear communication to
bolster the commitment to a sustained accommodative stance as appropriate. In a downside
risk scenario, the Bank of Canada could pursue further unconventional measures, with due
attention to the exit strategy and the soundness of the Bank’s balance sheet.
Directors agreed that the policy of a freely-floating exchange rate has continued to serve
Canada well, given the country’s openness to international trade and financial flows. In
particular, the flexible exchange rate has served as an effective “shock absorber” in the
context of sizable commodities shocks. They noted the staff’s assessment that the value of the
Canadian dollar is broadly in line with economic fundamentals, having weakened with the
decline in commodity prices.
Executive Directors commended the authorities’ bold fiscal stimulus package, utilizing the
space provided by past strong fiscal performance, and agreed that the near-term focus should
be on implementation. They saw the federal stimulus package as timely, appropriately sized,
diversified, and well structured, with steps to facilitate labor reallocation and protect the
vulnerable. The quarterly monitoring framework will be useful to assess implementation and
effectiveness of budget outlays. Directors also commended Canada for further liberalizing its
trade regime by lowering tariffs.
Directors agreed that Canada would be well-positioned to participate in a further,
internationally coordinated stimulus effort, if warranted. Given Canada’s strong fiscal
position—with the lowest debt-to-GDP ratio among G-7 countries—and the authorities’
commitment to medium-term structural surpluses, further fiscal expansion would not put at risk
debt sustainability. It would be important to ensure that any further measures are quickly
applicable and self-reversing. Meanwhile, Directors considered it appropriate to allow
automatic stabilizers to operate.
Looking beyond the crisis, Directors welcomed the authorities’ objective to maintain Canada’s
fiscal credibility. They saw scope to recalibrate the debt targets, once the outlook clarifies, to
underpin that objective. Future debt reduction would also provide fiscal space needed for
future costs related to population aging and health care.

4
Directors noted the resilience of Canada’s banks relative to their international peers, observing
that no Canadian bank has required public capital injections or guarantees. Rigorous limits on
leverage, robust regulatory capital ratios, effective supervision, and smooth cooperation across
regulatory agencies have underpinned financial stability. Directors commended the authorities
for the proactive steps taken to safeguard financial stability, including developing facilities to
inject capital and provide guarantees if needed. They called for continued vigilance in view of
the challenging credit cycle underway. Vigilance will be particularly warranted with regard to
exposures to commodity-affected sectors, non-banks such as insurers and pension plans, and
highly indebted households, with a special focus on cross-institution spillovers. Looking further
ahead, consolidation of securities regulation pursued by the government would further
strengthen the framework for preserving financial stability.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on Canada
May 11, 2009

1.
This statement reports on developments since the staff report was issued. They
do not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Recent indicators point to a continued, but moderating, contraction. Real GDP
declined by 0.1 percent in February compared with an 0.7 percent fall in January, mostly
reflecting lower production in good-producing industries, such as construction. The
unemployment rate rose to 8 percent in March—a seven-year high—although the pace of
job losses eased from February. The Bank of Canada’s Spring Business Outlook Survey
reported widespread expectations of slowing sales, but the balance of opinion was slightly
less pessimistic than in the prior survey. Housing starts and sales recovered in March on
low home prices and interest rates, albeit from weak levels, while non-residential
construction declined. Headline inflation decelerated from 1.4 percent to 1.2 percent (y/y)
in March, with core inflation registering 2 percent. Medium-term inflation expectations, as
reflected in the April Consensus Economic survey, remain anchored to the Bank’s
2-percent target.
3.
On April 21, the Bank of Canada lowered its target for the overnight interest
rate by 25 basis points to ¼ percent, and its April 23rd Monetary Policy Report laid
out a framework for conducting monetary policy at low interest rates. In conjunction
with its rate cut, the Bank noted that the target rate could be expected to remain at its
current level until the end of the second quarter of 2010, conditional on the inflation
outlook. The Bank also lengthened its repo facilities to a maximum maturity of one year.
The framework described less conventional tools, such as quantitative and credit easing,
that could be deployed in future. It elaborated guiding principles for the conduct of policy,
namely a focus on achieving the inflation target, maximum economic impact, neutrality
across sectors and assets, and prudence with regard to risks to the Bank’s balance sheet.
The need for further measures would be assessed at each monetary policy meeting. The
Bank lowered its projections for Canadian growth from -1.2 to -3 percent for 2009 and
from 3.8 to 2.5 percent for 2010, with risks to growth balanced and risks to inflation on the
downside.
4.
On the basis of recent data, staff has left the growth projection for 2009
broadly unchanged. Staff’s growth projection for 2009 (-2½ percent, year-over-year) are
between the latest Bank of Canada forecast (-3 percent) and the April consensus
(-2.3 percent). Staff’s projection for 2010 remains 1.2 percent, well below Bank of Canada
and Consensus forecasts, mainly on expectations of a slower U.S. recovery.
5.
Budget implementation is on track, with recent fiscal data more favorable
than anticipated. Most of the funds for Budget 2009 have been appropriated and spending
will come on stream this quarter, as planned. Data for the first 11 months of the fiscal year
2008/09 (i.e., April 2008 to February 2009) indicate a surplus of C$1.3 billion (less than

2
one-tenth of 1 percent of GDP), compared to a small deficit estimated in the January
Budget, on stronger than expected personal and other income taxes.
6.
Financial conditions remain more favorable than elsewhere, but credit
conditions are still tight. Major Canadian banks have raised preferred shares in recent
weeks, but have reported ongoing credit losses. The latest Bank of Canada Loan Officer
Survey shows that the pricing and availability of business credit tightened further in
2009Q1, albeit at a slower pace than in 2008Q4. Credit spreads remain elevated, while
stock prices have been volatile, echoing volatility in global equity and commodities
markets.
