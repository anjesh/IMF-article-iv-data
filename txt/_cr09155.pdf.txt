Staff Report for the 2009 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2009 Consultation with Belize
Approved by Gilbert Terrier and Michele Shannon
April 23, 2009

• Recent developments and outlook. Belize’s economic performance in 2008 was
broadly favorable. Despite losses from two tropical storms, real GDP grew by
3 percent. So far, the impact of the global downturn has been small. Real GDP growth
is projected at 1 percent in 2009, as the impact of the global slowdown is expected to be
partly offset by a recovery in agriculture and an expansion of the energy sector.
• External stability issues. The exchange rate appears broadly in line with fundamentals.
A sharp widening in the external current account deficit in 2008 was largely due to a
surge in FDI-related imports. External reserves at the CBB remain low by international
standards and the public debt ratios are high, at about 80 percent of GDP; however,
following debt restructuring in 2007, the external debt service profile will remain
relatively benign over the next 10 years.
• Focus of consultation. The discussions centered on near-term risks associated with the
global turmoil; steps to resume fiscal consolidation with the objective of substantially
reducing the debt ratios over the medium term; the financial viability of key public
sector programs; and reform of domestic liquidity management.
• Key recommendations: (i) limit growth in public sector recurrent spending to protect
the external position; (ii) develop contingency financing plans to protect the economy;
(iii) introduce in FY 2010/11 fiscal measures of 2 percent of GDP to achieve primary
surpluses consistent with halving the debt-to-GDP ratio to about 40 percent by 2019 and
regaining market access; (iv) strengthen financial viability of key public sector
programs; and (v) advance the implementation of liquidity management reforms.
• Discussions. The mission, comprising P. Gajdeczka (Head), N. Belhocine, G. ElMasry, and M. Kandil (all WHD) visited Belize during March 17–26, 2009.
Mr. McGoldrick (OED) participated in the final discussions.

I. BACKGROUND
1.
Belize’s macroeconomic performance has been uneven in recent years. Belize, a
small open economy, with a narrow export base, is vulnerable to exogenous shocks. Since
2005, growth in the traditional sectors of the economy has decelerated, reflecting structural
weaknesses and the impact of severe weather-related shocks during 2007–08, which
contributed to output losses, mostly in agriculture, and damaged infrastructure (Box 1).
Starting in 2006, petroleum extraction has been a major factor contributing to growth, and in
2008 accounted for 5½ percent of GDP. Domestic price inflation, which has been low
historically, rose to nearly 10 percent by mid-2008—driven largely by food and fuel prices.
2.
Belize’s external financing conditions have evolved in recent years. A rapid
buildup of external debt culminated in a debt restructuring agreement in February 2007. That
agreement resulted in a 21 percent NPV reduction in the external debt due to private
creditors, with an increase in debt-service obligations in two steps in 2010 and 2012, when
the coupon rate on the private restructured debt reaches 8.5 percent, up from 4.5 percent
currently. In mid-February, Moody’s upgraded Belize’s sovereign debt to B3. Although
access to private financing has remained constrained, renewed commitment to prudent
macroeconomic policies and to improving governance has elicited increased support from
official creditors.
3.
In 2008, Belize suffered significant losses from two tropical storms. The resulting
floods caused direct and economic losses estimated at about US$75 million (5.4 percent of
GDP), with a negative balance of payments impact of US$46 million. To help deal with the
impact of the floods, the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) and the Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) extended assistance of nearly US$15 million, largely for the
rehabilitation of infrastructure. Other donors provided emergency grants, food items, and
medical and technical assistance. From the Fund, Belize received US$6.9 million under the
policy on Emergency Natural Disasters Assistance (ENDA).
4.
The new government assumed power on a platform of good governance. After
10 years in opposition, the United Democratic Party won the elections in February 2008. In
order to take stock of the state of the public finances and conduct consultations on budgetary
priorities, approval of the 2008 budget was postponed from March to July. The government
reaffirmed its commitment to prudent fiscal and monetary policies and strong governance, to
sustain economic and social stability. During most of 2008, the issues dominating the
authorities’ agenda included dealing with the impacts of soaring food and fuel prices and of
the floods. The government has also challenged the validity of several contracts signed under
the previous administration, alleging excessive profit margins and corruption.
II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
5.
Macroeconomic performance was broadly favorable during 2008. An FDI-related
investment boom and growing oil production boosted growth, outweighing the impact of

5
continued weakness in agriculture that was compounded by the floods. After a surge in mid2008, inflation has abated in recent months.
•

Real GDP growth for 2008 is estimated at 3 percent. Non-oil GDP expanded by
2¼ percent.

•

Inflationary pressures have abated. Food and fuel prices pushed 12-month inflation
to 9½ percent in mid-year. By February 2009, inflation declined to 1½ percent.

•

The current account deficit widened sharply in 2008, to 10 percent of GDP.
Imports rose sharply, associated with FDI inflows in the construction and energy
sectors, grant-related public investment, and higher prices of imported fuel and food
products. Gross international reserves of the Central Bank of Belize (CBB) rose to
US$166 million at end-2008 (two months of imports), and have remained broadly
unchanged since then.

•

So far, Belize’s financial system has remained largely insulated from the global
downturn. However, nonperforming loans rose significantly in 2008.

•

The accounts of the central government are estimated to have registered an
overall surplus of 1¼ percent of GDP in FY 2008/09 (April–March). However,
the underlying fiscal position has weakened, as recurrent expenditure has been
growing rapidly at a time of rising dependence on volatile revenue sources, such as
petroleum and grants.

6.
Belize has received significant commitments of new donor assistance. Over the
past year, in addition to flood-related assistance, the IDB, the CDB, and the World Bank
have approved loan programs totaling US$45 million. In mid-2008, Belize received a
US$50 million line of credit from Taiwan, Province of China.
7.
Ongoing structural reforms are mostly in the areas of tax administration and
monetary management. The ASYCUDA (computerized customs system) was introduced
last February, and its full automation will be implemented by end-2009. A plan to reform
liquidity management prepared by the CBB is pending approval by the government. A Public
Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) review was completed last January with
European Union (EU) support, and a program of implementation is being developed with
IDB assistance.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
8.
Discussions centered on the impact of the global downturn on Belize and on a
medium-term strategy and structural reforms. Declining tourism, remittances, and FDI
inflows are expected to adversely affect domestic output. However, real GDP is projected to
grow by around 1 percent in 2009 reflecting a 20 percent increase in domestic oil production,

6
a recovery in agriculture, and an expansion in electricity generation. Twelve-month inflation
is projected to ease further, to 2½ percent by year-end. The external current account deficit
would contract significantly, as a decline in imports would exceed that of exports, mirroring
an expected fall in private capital inflows. The authorities have reaffirmed their commitment
to the medium-term fiscal strategy endorsed in the 2008 Article IV consultation, which
centered on sustained fiscal consolidation.
A. Addressing Near-Term Risks
9.
High debt and low reserves highlight Belize’s vulnerability to exogenous shocks.
The authorities and staff agreed that safeguarding international reserves and strengthening
the oversight of the financial system are key priorities. The authorities noted that
recently-contracted loans provided a balance of payments cushion and protected public
expenditure.
Budget implementation
10.
In FY2009/10, the overall balance of the central government is projected to shift
from a surplus to a deficit. The budget approved in March targets an overall deficit of
1¾ percent of GDP, compared with a surplus of 1¼ percent of GDP in the last fiscal year.
Current expenditure, including wages and purchases of goods and services, is projected to
continue rising in real terms in FY 2009/10 (Figure 2), and the budgeted increase is larger
than the projected revenue increase from partly restored taxes on domestic fuel consumption,
and domestically-funded investment would be broadly stagnant in FY 2009/10. Moreover,
the primary deficit excluding grants and oil revenue would widen by 1 percent of GDP,
highlighting budgetary dependence on volatile revenue sources such as petroleum and grants.
11.
Staff called for expenditure restraint to help ease pressures on the balance of
payments. The team noted that the high debt burden, pegged exchange rate regime, and
financing constraints limit the scope for counter-cyclical policies and encouraged the
authorities to limit increases in current spending, including the wage bill. Limiting increases
in recurrent spending this year, including in public sector wages after large wage increases
already granted in 2008 (11 percent on average), would help curtail pressures on the balance
of payments, facilitate fiscal adjustment over the medium term, while protecting
competitiveness through the demonstrative effect on private sector wages. Staff also
encouraged the authorities to protect public investment and spending on flood-related
outlays. The authorities noted that budgetary outlays were directed to high priority areas, and
that the recently received external assistance would help sustain domestic expenditure.
Financial sector oversight
12.
Staff and the authorities agreed on the need for the CBB to closely monitor
liquidity changes, while developing contingency plans for the banking system. In mid2008, significant shifts in public sector funds across banks led to temporary liquidity

7
13.
pressures in some institutions. Staff noted also that new liquidity pressures could
emerge in the banking system, reflecting lower exports, remittances, and FDI. The monetary
authorities told staff that they stood ready to use their instruments for domestic liquidity
management (reserves and liquidity requirements) as needed to achieve their inflation and
external reserves objectives. Staff encouraged the authorities to assess the feasibility of
introducing new mechanisms and facilities for assisting individual banks which may be faced
with temporary liquidity needs.
14.
There is a need to strengthen the supervision of the financial system’s asset
quality. Belize’s banking system appears broadly stable and with little external exposure
(text table below). However, commercial bank credit to the private sector expanded rapidly
in recent years, reaching the equivalent of 70 percent of GDP in 2008. In the context of
deteriorating overall economic conditions, bank portfolio has deteriorated significantly in
recent months. The NPL ratio doubled in 2008. This deterioration reflected largely
improvements in loan classifications in two banks (accounting for 46 of total banking assets),
following on-site assessments by bank supervisors. The reported strong capital position of
one bank should allow it to absorb the associated losses, and the other bank is in the process
of recapitalization. In general, capital ratios are high and bank liquidity is ample. The
situation of the insurance sector appears sound, as nearly all domestic liabilities are covered
by statutory reserves maintained in

but the FIU needs additional resources
to make it more effective.
Contingency financing
15.
Given Belize’s high vulnerability to exogenous shocks, staff encouraged the
authorities to develop plans for contingency external financing. The authorities noted that
they had secured significant new commitments from donors, and that external financing
assurances seemed adequate. Staff noted that deterioration in the global environment could
have an adverse impact on Belize’s external accounts and that, given the relatively low level
of Belize’s foreign reserves; the authorities might be well advised to seek additional
commitments from foreign donors.

8
B. Policies to Strengthen Fiscal Sustainability
16.
The authorities and staff agreed that the fiscal strategy should aim at
substantially reducing public debt ratios to regain policy flexibility. The authorities
recognized the need to resume fiscal adjustment. They concurred that, absent fiscal
consolidation, the debt ratios would decline only marginally, leaving Belize vulnerable to
exogenous shocks and threatening debt sustainability as demonstrated in the Debt
Sustainability Assessment (Appendix I). The authorities also agreed that the overall strategy
endorsed in the 2008 Article IV consultation remained valid, and that this strategy will
require raising and diversifying revenue sources and enhancing expenditure management.
They are planning to discuss specific measures to achieve these objectives in the context of
the FY2010/11 budget.
17.
Revenue and expenditure measures are needed to resume fiscal consolidation.
The central government primary surplus would need to rise from 2 percent of GDP in
FY2009/10 to above 4 percent of GDP by 2011 and to stay at that level in subsequent years
in order to halve the debt-to-GDP ratio by 2019. The authorities recognize the need to tighten
the fiscal position, in part because of rising interest payments on the restructured private debt.
•

Fiscal measures of 2 percent of GDP would be needed in FY 2010/11. A partial
freeze on recurrent expenditure and an increase in the sales tax rate by 2½ percent (to
12½ percent), would help bring the central government primary surplus to that level
(see Table 5). Continued expenditure restraint in FY 2011/12 would help the primary
surplus rise above 4½ percent of GDP, after taking into account an increase in public
sector capital investment in both years.

•

Petroleum revenues will remain fully integrated in the budget. Previous plans for
the establishment of an oil fund have been discarded, as the return on the investments
of this fund would likely be less than the cost of additional borrowing.

18.
The authorities emphasized their commitment to advance key fiscal reforms.
Discussions focused on the following areas:
•

Revenue administration. Plans to enhance the performance of tax departments
(reorganization and computerization) will need to be implemented as envisaged.
External support will be essential to increase the authorities’ capacity for tackling
contraband, including through regional anti-drug trafficking efforts.

•

Oil revenues. Accountability and transparency of oil revenues need to be improved,
in particular with regard to tax write-offs for exploration and investment. Staff
supported the authorities in their endeavors to enhance the transparency of budget
revenues from petroleum extraction, subject them to regular audits, and publish the
data.

9
•

Public financial management. The authorities intend to promptly implement key
recommendations stemming from the EU-sponsored review of public expenditure and
financial accountability, including in the areas of budgetary transparency, policybased budgeting, budget execution, accounting and reporting, and increased external
audit. Staff welcomed the publication of the audits of government financial
statements, as required under the Finance and Reform Act of 2005.

19.
Ensuring the financial viability of key public sector programs is essential for
fiscal sustainability (Box 2). Absent necessary reforms, key public programs—social
security, public servants’ pension fund, National Health Insurance, and Development Finance
Corporation (DFC)—may turn out to be substantial liabilities to the government and
undermine the authorities’ debt strategy. The Social Security Board (SSB) and the pension
plan for civil servants will require a combination of new participant contributions and
modification of benefits to put them on a sound financial footing. The extension of the
National Health Insurance (NHI) to the entire country has been delayed pending
identification of sustainable funding sources. The Development Finance Corporation has
been reactivated with new governance safeguards, but its mandate needs to be clearly defined
and financing provided to cover its operating costs until it becomes financially self-sufficient.
With respect to the SSB and the NHI, the authorities did not present a specific timetable for
advancing with the needed reform program.
C. Reforms to Reinvigorate Growth
20.
Belize faces the challenge of raising its medium-term growth potential. Trade and
infrastructure bottlenecks, together with high cost of domestic financing, hinder the
competitiveness of key sectors. As a result of insufficient maintenance and lack of new
investment, Belize’s infrastructure is inadequate and raises the cost of agricultural exports
and tourism. Most recently, growth has been boosted by oil discoveries, but overall
performance has weakened, reflecting problems in several sectors.
•

Development strategy. Jointly with multilateral donors and the private sector, the
government is planning to develop a medium-term strategy to boost growth in
tourism and agriculture. The staff team strongly supported the authorities’ plans to
seek financing for projects consistent with their fiscal strategy.

•

Private sector investment. Mobilization of private sector resources will be a key
factor in determining Belize’s medium-term growth potential. The authorities’
emphasis on good governance should help improve the investment climate further,
particularly when accompanied by sustained fiscal consolidation, enforcement of the
rule of law, and the respect of contracts.

•

Natural disaster management. The National Emergency Management Organization
of Belize has joined the World Bank’s initiative for Central American Probabilistic

10
Risk Assessment (CAPRA), which should enhance Belize’s capacity to deal with
natural disasters.
21.
Promoting financial sector development will also help enhance economic growth.
Early introduction of market-based instruments of liquidity management, as recommended
by Fund technical assistance, would help address some of the distortions prevalent in the
financial system, such as high spreads between deposit and lending rates. It would also
contribute to the development of an active interbank market. Later this year, the CBB plans
to auction a limited amount of Treasury bills, which at present are not marketable and are
subject to interest ceilings. Based on this experience, the CBB will decide how to best
proceed with the intended securitization of the government overdraft account.
D. External Stability Issues
22.
The authorities stated that Belize’s fixed exchange arrangement is a crucial
anchor for financial and macroeconomic stability. In the current global environment, this
arrangement limits macroeconomic policy options, given Belize’s low reserves and relatively
high debt. More generally, tight fiscal policy is crucial for maintaining exchange rate stability
and mitigating associated risks to external debt sustainability (Appendix I). The authorities
agreed with the staff’s position, noting that, in addition to their strategy of fiscal
consolidation, existing capital controls could be more tightly enforced to provide additional
protection against destabilizing capital flows, thereby further supporting the exchange rate
peg (Box 3).
23.
Staff’s analysis suggests that Belize’s exchange rate remains broadly in line with
fundamentals (Appendix II). In real terms, the exchange rate was broadly stable during
2008, after some decline in recent years from the 1990 levels. The authorities agreed with the
staff’s assessment, noting that their future policies and envisaged structural reforms aim at
strengthening productivity and Belize’s international competitiveness.
24.
The external current account deficit is expected to narrow to 6¾ percent of GDP
in 2009. Staff and the authorities agreed that, while the overall assessment of external
stability has not changed fundamentally since the last Article IV consultation, short-term
external risks have increased considerably, and policies should be geared at mitigating
exposure to exogenous shocks.
•

Trade balance. Belize’s trade balance is expected to improve sharply in 2009, as the
surge in imports in 2008 was related mostly to the floods and large investments in
tourism-related construction and electricity generation. As new electricity-generating
capacity comes on stream in 2009-10, electricity imports from neighboring Mexico
will be significantly reduced.

11
•

External financing. As noted, staff encouraged the authorities to assess their external
financing needs and assess the possible use of contingency financing arrangements
from international financial institutions.

•

External reserves. Raising international reserves to at least three months of imports
would provide an important cushion against external shocks, and help further support
Belize’s fixed exchange rate arrangement.

25.
Staff’s assessment of economic developments and external stability remains
constrained by data weaknesses. Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly
adequate for surveillance. Information on private external assets and liabilities is not
complete, and data on private capital flows are available with significant lags. The authorities
are following up on the recommendations of the multi-sector statistics mission in 2008. The
Statistical Institute of Belize is preparing the release in early 2010 of a new CPI, based on an
updated consumption basket.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
26.
Belize’s economic performance in 2008 was broadly favorable. Despite the losses
associated with two tropical storms, real GDP rose by 3 percent, boosted by growing oil
extraction and FDI-related investments. Inflation has slowed down considerably in recent
months, after the surge of last summer, and international reserves have increased, benefiting
from robust FDI inflows and external aid disbursements.
27.
A tighter fiscal stance would help protect the external position. The global
slowdown is expected to adversely impact Belize’s economy through lower tourism receipts
and remittances, and a substantial decline in FDI inflows. As a result, reduced foreign
exchange inflows may weaken the external position and contribute to liquidity pressures in
the domestic banking system. To address these risks, it would be advisable to restrain growth
in public expenditure, including through wage moderation, thereby reducing pressures on the
balance of payments and helping safeguard external reserves. However, outlays for
reconstruction and other investment should be protected, given their positive supply-side
effects.
28.
Oversight over the financial system needs to be further strengthened. In recent
years, credit growth has been rapid and the deterioration in nonperforming loans is cause for
concern. Close monitoring of the banking system, including with respect to credit and
liquidity risks, will be warranted to help preserve the stability of the domestic financial
system. At the same time, vigilant oversight over domestic insurance companies should
continue. In view of the risks to Belize’s economy stemming from the global downturn, the
authorities are encouraged to develop contingency plans for the financial system as well as a
framework for the provision of liquidity to address temporary pressures. The recent
strengthening of the AML legislation is welcome, and adequate resources should be provided
for the FIU to enable its satisfactory implementation.

12
29.
Fiscal policies aimed at lowering debt ratios substantially over the medium term
are key to strengthening Belize’s debt sustainability. The fiscal strategy endorsed in the
2008 Article IV consultation—aimed at cutting the debt ratio by about half by 2019—
remains valid. Significant adjustments to the fiscal position will be required to help meet
rising debt service obligations on private debt restructured in 2007. Tax revenue measures
together with strict control on the growth of recurrent spending would help raise the primary
surplus of the central government to the desired levels beginning in the next fiscal year.
These measures would also help reduce the budget’s reliance on volatile revenue sources.
30.
Financial stability of key public sector programs needs to be strengthened and
transparency of the taxation regime for the petroleum industry enhanced to underpin
sustained fiscal consolidation. The Social Security Board and the pension plan for civil
servants may require a combination of new participant contributions and modification of
benefits to put both systems on a sound financial footing. The proposed extension of the NHI
scheme should only proceed once it has been adequately funded. And the mandate of the
DFC needs to be clearly defined and financial backing identified to cover its operating costs.
Finally, petroleum revenues should remain integrated in the budget, published, and subject to
regular audits.
31.
Mobilization of private and public resources is needed to raise Belize’s mediumterm growth potential. The authorities are rightly focused on preparing a policy framework
that will guide development of key sectors such as tourism, agriculture, and petroleum
extraction. Preparation of this strategy should draw on the contribution of the private sector
as well as the support of multilateral donors. Public sector financing for the related projects
needs to be consistent with the authorities’ fiscal strategy. Progress in introducing a more
flexible domestic liquidity management framework could help reduce the cost of domestic
financing. The authorities’ emphasis on good governance and fiscal consolidation and their
commitment to enforce the rule of law and respect contracts should help improve the
investment climate.
32.
Strong macroeconomic policies are necessary to underpin Belize’s fixed
exchange rate arrangement. The exchange rate peg has served Belize well, as an important
anchor for macroeconomic policies and for expectations. At present, the Belize dollar
appears broadly in line with its medium-term fundamentals. However, given high public debt
and relatively low international reserves, and Belize’s vulnerability to exogenous shocks, the
credibility of this exchange rate arrangement crucially depends on sustaining fiscal
consolidation. Over the medium term, fiscal prudence should help raise international reserves
to at least three months of imports, an important cushion in the event of external shocks. In
the short run, however, Belize is encouraged to develop plans for access to external financing
to protect against the impact of a sharper-than-anticipated deterioration in its external
accounts.
33.
The next Article IV consultation is expected to be held on the standard 12-month
cycle.

Box 1. Belize: Emergency Natural Disaster Assistance
Belize is highly vulnerable to weather-related natural disasters. Since 1998, Belize has
suffered from seven tropical storms or hurricanes of powerful magnitudes. During the 2008
hurricane season, two tropical systems caused losses estimated at nearly 5.4 percent of
GDP. This came a year after Hurricane Dean inflicted damages that reached 3.7 percent of
GDP.

or weakened many bridges.
More than 1,700 buildings were inundated, destroying private household items and private
and public housing infrastructure. About one-sixth of Belize’s population was affected.

The balance of payments’ impact of the two floods is estimated at US$46 million
(3.3 percent of GDP). Most of the export losses occurred during 2008 in the tourism,
citrus, and banana sectors, while losses in sugar exports will be principally reflected in
2009. About two thirds of the impact on imports will come from purchases of
reconstruction-related materials, with most of the remainder in the form of agricultural
inputs. The combined impact of the floods over 2008–09 is equivalent to nearly one third
of end-2008 external foreign reserves.
Belize made a purchase under the Fund’s policy on Emergency Assistance for
Natural Disasters (ENDA) equivalent to 25 percent of quota (SDR 4.7 million). Fund
financing partly offset the balance of payments impact from both floods, at a time when
Belize’s official reserves were relatively low (2 months of imports).
The international community is also providing assistance. The CDB and IDB are
providing US$15 million for infrastructure rehabilitation. The International Red Cross,
PAHO, UNICEF, UNDP, and USAID provided emergency grants (US$0.5 million), food
items, and medical and technical assistance.

Box 2. Belize: Key Public Sector Programs
Key public sector programs in Belize include four public pension schemes: the Social Security,
the pension plan for public officers (PPO), the National Health Insurance (NHI), and the
Development Finance Corporation (DFC).
The general Social Security System (SSS) is a contributory, partially-funded, defined
benefit scheme that is based on a scaled premium system. Contributions are adjusted over
time to cover the expected cost of benefits and administration. It provides retirement pensions
from age 60, drawing on contributions of at least 10 years, up to a maximum of 60 percent of the
highest three years of earnings in the 15-year period preceding retirement. The 2008 actuarial
report recommended that contributions and other parameters of the system, such as income
ceilings and the retirement age, be adjusted to ensure the system’s sustainability.
The PPO is an unfunded, noncontributory defined benefit scheme. It provides retirement
pensions from age 55 for public officers with at least 10 years of service, up to a maximum of
67 percent of the average earnings of the last three years of service. Pension benefits are adjusted
on an ad-hoc basis by the government. All expenses are covered by the central government
budget. PPO expenses have been growing annually by15 percent over the last six years, which
will require additional annual budget contributions of about ½ percent of GDP over ten years. By
combining benefits from the SSS and PPO, some categories of public officers may obtain
combined replacement rates of more than 100 percent of their average salary.
The NHI was established in 2001, following a pilot project. It currently serves 73,000 people
in Belize City and in the southern districts of Stann Creek and Toledo. In 2007, the government
decided to extend the NIH to the entire population of Belize. Two strategic approaches are
considered: (i) a gradual, geographic-based expansion; and (ii) a gradual expansion targeting
specific population groups, to progressively cover the whole country.
DFC was created in 1963 to stimulate economic growth through subsidized credit to the
private sector. Its operations were funded by the government of Belize, and borrowing mainly
from the CDB and the Social Security Board. All of DFC’s debt is guaranteed by the
government. After a period of rapid expansion and a significant increase in nonperforming assets,
DFC was declared bankrupt. In July 2005, a new Board of Directors was appointed to wind down
the operations of DFC, focusing on collecting its outstanding debt in an orderly manner, while
minimizing any subsidy from the government. In February 2009, at the initiative of the new
government, Parliament approved the new DFC Act to reactivate the lending function, initially
funded by a CDB loan.

Box 3. Belize: Capital Controls
Exchange system. Since 1976, the Belize dollar has been pegged to the U.S. dollar at the
rate of BZ$2=US$1. Commercial banks and other authorized dealers are allowed to buy and
sell foreign exchange at the official rate. Belize accepted the obligations of Article VIII,
Sections 2, 3, and 4 on June 14, 1983. It maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on
the making of payments and transfers for current account transactions. This system is
administered by commercial banks and all bona fide transactions are approved.
Capital controls. All capital transfers require the approval of the Central Bank of Belize
(CBB), although these are normally administered liberally. Such controls apply to the
contracting of foreign capital and money market instruments; derivatives; and credit,
including guarantees, sureties, and financial backup facilities. Transactions that are subject to
controls include:
•

Loans. All foreign borrowings by private persons and business entities require CBB
approval. Payments of interest on these loans require approval by the CBB in such
cases when clearance from the Commissioner of Income Tax is required. However,
developers and businesses operating in the export processing zone (EPZ) and the
commercial free zone (CFZ) may obtain loans or advances of up to US$1 million
from offshore banks without prior CBB approval. Loans and advances beyond that
amount require written CBB approval.

•

Direct investment. All outward investment requires approval by the CBB.
Registration of inward foreign direct investment with the CBB is encouraged, to
facilitate the subsequent repatriation of funds or associated profits. The transfer of
profits and dividends requires approval by the CBB when clearance by the
Commissioner of Income Tax is required.

•

Real estate and other personal transactions. All inward or outward real estate
transactions require clearance by the CBB. The settlement of personal loans and the
transfer of gifts, endowments, inheritances, or other assets also require CBB approval.
The outward transfer of gambling proceeds by residents and nonresidents also
requires clearance by the CBB.

Table 5. Belize: Summary of Macroeconomic Scenarios
________________________________________________________________________________

For the analysis of the medium-term prospects under different policy assumptions, staff prepared
two medium-term macroeconomic scenarios. A baseline scenario assumes broad continuation of
present policies, while an active policy scenario is based on fiscal adjustment and a larger
primary surplus in the central government budget.
There are a number of assumptions common in both scenarios. In particular, the assumptions
about the production and fiscal revenue from oil extraction and about consumer price inflation.
Baseline Scenario
The main assumption is regarding the unchanged policy stance from the projected outcome for
the present fiscal year. Because of the associated external and fiscal uncertainties and the need
to borrow on expensive commercial terms, it is assumed that there will be a declining level of
multilateral lending and bilateral grants, and that investment levels would be such that economic
growth would remain low.
•

Real GDP growth—to remain around 2½ percent.

•

Fiscal policy—primary surplus in the central government budget will gradually shrink
over time with the projected decline in oil revenues, declining from 2.6 percent of GDP to
2 percent in the medium term.

•

Reserve accumulation—given the high level of external borrowing, reserves coverage
will remain low, declining below two months of imports, in the medium term.

Active Scenario
This scenario essentially emulates the projection included in the 2008 Article IV staff report.
Consistent with the assumption of front-loaded fiscal adjustment, a GST rate increase is
introduced in FY2010/11. Expenditure restraint is enforced on the wage bill and purchases of
goods and services, growing at a rate of 3 percent, in FY 2010/11 and 11/12. Oil revenues are
integrated fully into the budget, so that starting in FY 2010/11 a stable stream of revenues is
budgeted over time. The primary surplus builds up to peak at 4.5 percent in 2011, and gradually
tapers off over time, as debt ratios decline. Policy adjustment is assumed to foster confidence
and larger financing from international financial institutions and bilateral donors, allowing for
higher investment and growth.
•

Real GDP growth—to gradually increase with higher investment to around 3½ percent
over the medium term.

•

Fiscal policy—to raise the primary surplus target in the central government budget over
time, from 1.9 percent of GDP in FY 2009/10 to peak at 4.6 percent of GDP by 2011. The
adjustment is based on expenditures restraint through FY 2011/12, and a 2½ percent
GST rate increase in FY 2010/11.

Reserve accumulation—tighter policies and larger capital inflows would enable a more
ambitious reserve build-up, to above three months of imports starting in 2013.

APPENDIX I. DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Results of an updated Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) are broadly in line with those
of the 2008 Article IV consultation report. Minor differences arise from revisions to
historical data and a better fiscal effort in 2008 than was previously assumed.
A. Key Assumptions
The DSA was constructed around two scenarios (see Table 5), which assume:
•

Public sector debt includes the central government, publicly guaranteed external debt,
and other public sector external debt, and contingent liabilities.

•

Future central government liabilities to the pension plan for public officers and
national health insurance are included.

•

FDI flows are in line with historical levels.

•

External debt is on a gross basis, while domestic debt is on a net basis.

•

Multilateral and bilateral loans are borrowed at LIBOR, plus 100 bps.

The baseline scenario assumes that the domestic debt stock is constant, and that financing
requirements will be covered primarily by external commercial creditors at market interest
rates (i.e., 10-year U.S. T-Bond plus 400 bps), and to a lesser extent by multilaterals.
The active scenario assumes that enough multilateral financing will be available to meet
financing requirements.
B. Assessment
Under the baseline scenario, debt will gradually decline. This scenario suggests a
downward trend in the period covered by the DSA from 77.3 percent of GDP at end-2008 to
69 percent of GDP at end-2014, owing to some fiscal effort, as reflected in a primary surplus.
While the primary surplus is projected to decline over the next few years, it will need to
rebound in the outer years to compensate for a pick-up in interest payments, as higher step-up
coupon rates on the restructured debt take effect.
Bounds tests reveal that the debt trajectory can change significantly in response to
standard shocks. Debt ratios are particularly sensitive to the depreciation shock, given that
more than 80 percentage of the total public debt was denominated in foreign currency in
2008. In the event of a 30 percent depreciation, the total debt would climb to 112 percent of
GDP and then follow a similar trajectory to that of baseline.
Under the active scenario, total debt ratios decline more strongly to 55 percent of GDP
by 2014. A stronger fiscal adjustment and higher availability of multilateral financing at

29
favorable terms are the driving factors. Bound tests reveal reduced vulnerability to standard
shocks compared to the passive scenario, although a 30% depreciation of the currency would
trigger a similar step-increase in the debt ratio, followed by a steeper decline.

B3. Primary balance is at historical average minus one standard deviation
B4. Combination of B1-B3 using 1/2 standard deviation shocks
B5. One time 30 percent real depreciation in 2006 10/
B6. 10 percent of GDP increase in other debt-creating flows in 2006

1/ Public sector debt includes central government, publicly guaranteed external debt and other public sector external debt. External debt is on a gross basis, while domestic debt is on a net basis.
2/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + αε(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; α = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and ε = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as αε(1+r).

For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of 2013 to capture the increased interest rates starting from 2013 due to the step-up structure of the exchanged bond.

1/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; ρ = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms,
g = real GDP growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and alpha = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock. ρ increases with an appreciating domestic currency (ε > 0)
and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP)
remain at their levels of the last projection year.

B4. Combination of B1-B3 using 1/2 standard deviation shocks
B5. One time 30 percent real depreciation in 2006 10/
B6. 10 percent of GDP increase in other debt-creating flows in 2006

1/ Public sector debt includes central government, publicly guaranteed external debt and other public sector external debt. External debt is on a gross basis, while domestic debt is on a net basis.
2/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + αε(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; α = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and ε = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as αε(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of 2013 to capture the increased interest rates starting from 2013 due to the step-up
structure of the exchanged bond.

APPENDIX II. BELIZE—ASSESSMENT OF EXTERNAL STABILITY
The model-based approach suggests that the Belize’s actual exchange rate is broadly in line
with fundamentals and consistent with external stability. For this assessment, the CGER
methodology was followed using various measures that captured Belize’s economic fundamentals,
such as productivity differentials, terms of trade, government consumption and net foreign assets. 1
While two different samples of comparator countries were used (Caribbean and a wider tourismdependent group), their results are very similar. 2 The model-based approach suggests that Belize’s
actual REER is about 5.3 percent below its estimated equilibrium level.

The real effective exchange rate has been moving downward since the late 1990s. A secular
decline is observable since 1997, when measured relative to trading partner countries, source
countries for tourism, and competitor countries for tourism, thanks to a large degree to the U.S.
dollar’s weakening against major currencies over that period, and a lower inflation in Belize
compared to its major trading partners and competitors. This trend was partly reversed with the
outbreak of the global financial crisis in the latter half of 2008, when the U.S. dollar strengthened
considerably.
The underlying current account deficit is consistent with declining debt-to-GDP ratios over
the medium term. The current account deficit in 2008 (10 percent of GDP) was affected by several
temporary factors: (i) a surge in FDI-related imports; (ii) a decline in weather-affected exports;
(iii) temporarily reduced interest payments on the Super Bond (restructured debt); and (iv) an
above-trend net oil trade balance before domestic oil production tapers off, even as a sizeable
increase in domestically generated electricity comes on line. The underlying current account deficit,
excluding transitional factors, is estimated at 4.0 percent of GDP in 2008, or 0.8 percent of GDP
after interest payments are excluded. This is about 1¾ percentage points less than the estimated
1

The projected current account deficits are significantly lower than in the past or in the peer
economies, and are consistent with declining debt/GDP ratios. The recent widening in the
external current account deficit is expected to be partly reversed in 2009. The recent surge in
imports appears to be related mostly to private capital inflows into key export and import
substituting sectors, such as tourism-related real estate and construction, as well as electricity
generation. A number of these projects are expected to be largely completed in 2009. Belize’s
balance of payments position is also expected to benefit from additional electricity-generating
capacity coming on stream during 2008–10, which will significantly reduce the need for imported
electricity from neighboring Mexico. Key agricultural export sectors benefit from preferential
access to EU markets, although in the near term prices and EU demand are expected to decline.
Tourism has been relatively resilient to global downturns, as Belize historically experienced lower
losses than in key competitor markets.
External debt ratios will remain high over the medium term, highlighting the need for
strengthened financial policies. Under the unchanged policies (passive) scenario, external debt
ratio will decline by 5 percent of GDP over the next five years, reaching 63 percent of GDP. Such a
high debt ratio will constrain the country’s ability to respond to exogenous shocks. Against this
background, and in order to create the requisite policy space, further sustained efforts are needed to
strengthen the country’s fiscal and external positions.

APPENDIX III. BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF APPENDICES
Discussions. The 2009 Article IV consultation discussions were held in Belize during March 17–26,
2009. The mission met with Prime Minister Barrow, Finance Secretary Waight, Central Bank of Belize
(CBB) Governor Ysaguirre, other government officials and representatives of the private sector, labor
unions and the political opposition. The staff team comprised P. Gajdeczka (Head), N. Belhocine, G. ElMasry, and M. Kandil (all WHD). Mr. P. McGoldrick (OED) joined the final discussions.
Exchange Arrangement. Belize has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 and
maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current transactions.
The Belize dollar has been pegged to the U.S. dollar at BZ$2=US$1 since 1976.
Fund Relations. On February 18, the Board approved a request for a loan by Belize, 25 percent of
quota, SDR$4.7 million, under the Fund’s policy on emergency assistance for natural disasters in the
wake of the losses caused by the floods in October which followed May floods. The last financial
arrangement was a Stand-by Arrangement for the period 12/03/84 to 05/31/86 totaling
SDR$7.13 million, fully drawn.
Technical Assistance.
• MCM missions took place during September 29–October 3, bank supervision and regulation.
• A follow-up STA mission on national accounts, supply and use tables, is scheduled in the
second half of 2009.
• A follow-up STA mission on FDI and IIP development is scheduled in April 2009.
Relations with the World Bank Group. A five year Country Assistance Strategy was completed for
Belize in August 2000 (Report No. 20708-BEL). The World Bank currently has no active projects in
Belize. The World Bank Board approved in March 2009 an Interim Strategy Note for the period of
2009-2011, which envisions Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAA) and modest investment lending,
to be approved by the World Bank Board in December 2009. The interim strategy includes one
investment loan for $15 million (municipal development project).
Relations with the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). The 2004–08 Country Strategy,
approved in September 2004, aims at assisting Belize in its transition towards private sector-led growth.
In December 2006, IDB approved US$25 million in Policy-Based Loan (PBL), which has been fully
disbursed. Two loans for Solid Waste Management and Sustainable Tourism were approved towards the
end of 2008. A US$5 million loan for Road Reconstruction under the Immediate Response Facility was
approved in February 2009. The IDB and Government have also been working on a policy-based loan in
the social and fiscal sustainability areas.
Relations with the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB). In December 2006, CDB approved
US$25 million in Policy-Based Loan. In December 2006, the CDB also approved a loan of
US$12.6 million to Belize for the upgrade the Placencia road. Technical assistance includes a TA loan
for the modernization of the Customs and Excise Department, and TA grants of US$101,200 million
each, for the modernization of financial regulations, and to assist Belize to establish an appropriate
institutional framework for macro-economic management. CDB has continued to respond to Belize’s
natural disaster emergency needs. In 2008, CDB approved two loans of US$8.8 million and 0.5 million
for recovery and the reconstruction of a major bridge which was destroyed by flood water.

IX. Exchange Rate
Since 1976, the Belize dollar has been pegged to the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, at
the rate of BZ$2 per U.S. dollar. Since the second quarter of 1995, the central bank has been
resorting to the rationing of its sales of foreign exchange to commercial banks on an ad-hoc

3
basis, except for some essential import items, which has given rise to restrictions on the
making of payments and transfers for current international transactions 3 .
X. Last Article IV Consultation
The last Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on
February 22, 2008; the relevant documents were IMF Country Report Nos. 08/88 and 08/92.
Belize is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle.

III. Country Strategy

The IDB has shared with the Government of Belize a draft Country Strategy with Belize for
the period 2008-2012. The draft Country Strategy has four objectives: (i) Ensure sound fiscal
management and public sector transparency; (ii) Create conditions for and restore sustainable,
private sector led growth; (iii) Improve Human resource development and social protection;
and (iv) Rehabilitation of basic infrastructure. Two loans for Solid Waste Management and
Sustainable Tourism were approved towards the end of 2008 consistent with the Country
Strategy objective of “Sustainable development of tourism and agriculture.” A US$5 million
loan for Road Reconstruction under the Immediate Response Facility was approved on April 7,
2009 to respond to road infrastructure damage during the November 2008 floods. The IDB and
Government have also been working on a policy-based loan in the social and fiscal
sustainability areas.
In preparation for the Country Strategy, the IDB undertook an extensive economic and sector
work program in 2007 and 2008 that included studies on: A Growth Diagnostic; Transport
Sector Study; Energy Sector Review; Water and Sanitation Sector Study; Trade and Integration
Sector Note; Private Sector Development Study; Tourism Sector Note; Education Sector
Study; Social Expenditure Review; Social Protection and Health Sector Study; Indigenous
Peoples Policy Note; Disaster Risk Management Sector Note; Citizen Security Note and credit
to small and medium enterprises, housing and education.

III. Economic and Sector Work
Much of CDB’s country and sector work in Belize since 2003 has focused on helping the
authorities to address significant macroeconomic and fiscal imbalances, and to address
sustainability issues in the operations of the Development Finance Corporation. This has
resulted in a slower rate of loan approvals. A private sector loan to Belcogen was approved in
2005 while activity levels on CDB’s main direct poverty reduction program, the Basic Needs
Trust Fund, has been maintained.

7
The Belize authorities have been making significant effort to address the difficult fiscal and
debt consequences that have resulted from the expansionary policies of recent years. In May
2006, the Government of Belize (GOBZ) requested a Policy Based Loan (PBL) of twenty-five
million United States dollars (USD25 mn) from the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB)
together with technical assistance (TA) support by way of additional loan and grants to assist in
ensuring the success and sustainability of fundamental fiscal and structural reform measures
which are being implemented. This request was approved by the CDB in December 2006 and
the first disbursement was made in August 2007. The PBL is part of a broader assistance
strategy by CDB for Belize. The strategy recognizes that the continuation of the fiscal and
external imbalances will affect Belize’s ability to undertake critical investments in social and
economic infrastructure. The PBL is intended to help GOBZ close the fiscal and external
financing gaps over the short to medium term, while it continues to implement corrective
measures, including the restructuring of its debt, the reform of its tax regime and the
strengthening of its fiscal management capacity. In December 2006, the CDB also approved a
loan of USD$12.6mn to Belize for the upgrade the Placencia road which was appraised to have
significant social and economic benefits. Technical assistance (TA) was also approved by the
CDB to Belize to help ensure the success of its adjustment efforts. Such assistance includes a
TA loan for the modernization of the Customs and Excise Department, and TA grants of
USD101,200 each, for the modernization of financial regulations, and to assist Belize to
establish an appropriate institutional framework for macro-economic management.
CDB has continued to respond to Belize’s natural disaster emergency needs. In 2008, CDB
approved a loan of US$8.8mn for the reconstruction of a major bridge which was destroyed by
flood water.

General: Data are broadly adequate for surveillance, as in general, the quality, coverage, and
timeliness of statistical information permit an adequate monitoring of economic
developments. However, the July 2007 report by the multisector statistics mission list
shortcomings in national accounts, prices, external trade and debt, government finance, and
labor statistics. The Central Bank of Belize publishes, in irregular intervals, a quarterly
bulletin covering developments in the real, fiscal, monetary, and external sectors, as well as
an annual report and a statistical digest. The country has participated in the GDDS since
September 27, 2006.
Real sector: A new national accounts system has been phased-in. Under the new system,
national accounts at constant and current prices are produced quarterly, instead of just
annually. The base year for the compilation of national accounts has moved from 1984 to
2000, with consequent quality improvement of estimates at constant and current prices.
Priorities for the period ahead include establishing a national accounts user advisory
committee, updating the SNAPC-Belize application to take account of changes in the
structure of the economy, modifying the concept of government industrial activity in
conformity with the guidelines set out in the 1993 SNA, rebasing the national accounts to
2006, including electricity imports in the merchandise trade statistics, conducting a survey of
activity in the Commercial Free Zone, disaggregating the imports of the Export Processing
Zone, undertaking an inventory of data sources for national accounts, updating the Register
of Establishments, annotating all GDP tables to distinguish the various revision stages; and
collecting data on informal sector activity.
Prices and labor statistics: The CPI market basket is based on a household expenditure
survey that was conducted between June 1990 and March 1991 and needs to be updated.
Also, the CPI is calculated only four times a year (February, May, August, and November),
with a lag of about three months. Labor market statistics are scarce and available at irregular
intervals. Priorities for the period ahead include allocating additional staff to compile the
CPI, establishing a CPI advisory committee to advise on the nature and purpose of the index,
revising the procedures for collecting prices for perishable goods, undertaking the new
Household Income and Expenditure Survey, improving the timeliness of the index,
compiling a monthly CPI in accordance with international best practice, publishing the CPI
weights, streamlining the price collection instruments, developing and disseminating a
schedule for releasing the CPI, improving the metadata on the CPI, and developing
procedures for taking account of quality change.

9
Fiscal accounts: Classification of expenditure into current and capital does not conform to
international standards. Priorities for the period ahead include preparing a comprehensive list
of institutions that comprise the central government, general government, and the public
sector; evaluating each statutory body to determine its proper sectorization; compiling GFS
for the social security fund; including the social security fund and the extra budgetary units in
the coverage of public sector debt data; treating all government transactions in accordance
with the guidelines of the GFSM 1986; ensuring that the annual financial statements for
budgetary central government are audited in a timely manner; disseminating the statistics for
central government aggregates and debt in accordance with the GDDS recommendations;
and disseminating the available monthly data on budgetary central government revenue,
expenditure and financing.
Monetary accounts: The coverage of monetary data is incomplete. The inclusion of credit
union data remains a priority, although recent information submitted contains the accounts of
the six largest credit unions. Contrary to methodological recommendations, interest accruals
are included in other assets or other liabilities, rather than being classified along with the
underlying instruments. In addition, unclassified assets and liabilities are large. Priorities for
the period ahead include sending a revised form 2SR a soon as the data for the rest of the
credit unions become available; classifying international offshore banks as part of other
financial corporations sub sector; sectorizing the Social Security Board as part of the general
government; establishing an integrated monetary base; and establishing data sharing
procedure between the CBB and the Supervisor of Insurance.
Balance of payments: The compilation of balance of payments is based on the fifth edition
of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5). The authorities are refining the process for
collecting relevant data that is enabling regular presentation of quarterly balance of payments
statistics. International Investment Position (IIP) Statistics are not compiled. There is a need
to improve and expand the compilation and dissemination of external sector statistics.
Additional staff and relevant training is higly recommended.
External debt: There are discrepancies between the external debt data reported by the
central bank and those reported by the ministry of finance, particularly with respect to gross
external disbursements of the central government. In addition, the data reported by the
central bank and the ministry of finance on the external debt of the public enterprises are
incomplete and inconsistent with the information provided by the public enterprises. The
authorities are seeking to reduce the discrepancies and inconsistencies by fostering greater
cooperation among the agencies involved. An effort to develop a database for private sector
debt is under way.
Development Finance Corporation: Priorities for the period ahead include recording the
financial support provided by the government to DFC in recent years; recording the loans to
DFC locked by mortgage securities as debt; compiling a consolidated sect oral balance sheet
for insurance companies and the Belize mutual fund; and renewing efforts to collect balance
sheet data from the DFC.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund

Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2009 Article IV Consultation with Belize
On May 8, 2009 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Belize. 1
Background
Belize, a small open economy with a narrow export base, remains vulnerable to exogenous
shocks. Since 2005, growth in the traditional sectors of the economy has decelerated, reflecting
in part the impact of severe weather-related shocks during 2007–08. Starting in 2006, petroleum
extraction has been a major factor contributing to growth, accounting for approximately
5 percent of GDP in 2008. A debt restructuring agreement in February 2007 provided a
substantial reduction in the net present value of the debt owed to private creditors. Over the
past year, a renewed commitment to prudent macroeconomic policies and to improving
governance has elicited increased support from official creditors.
Macroeconomic performance was broadly favorable during 2008. Despite losses from two
tropical storms, real GDP increased by about 3 percent. Domestic price inflation, which has
been low historically, rose to nearly 10 percent by mid-2008, driven largely by food and fuel
prices. By February 2009, inflation declined to 1½ percent. The current account deficit widened
sharply to 10 percent of GDP in 2008, reflecting a surge in FDI-related imports and higher
prices of imported food and fuel. Gross international reserves of the Central Bank of Belize rose
to US$166 million at end-2008, the equivalent of two months of imports.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
The accounts of the central government are estimated to have registered an overall surplus of
1¼ percent of GDP in FY 2008/09 (April–March). However, the underlying fiscal position has
weakened, as recurrent expenditure has been growing rapidly at a time of rising dependence on
volatile revenue sources, such as petroleum and grants. Belize’s financial system appears so
far largely insulated from the global downturn. However, commercial bank credit to the private
sector expanded rapidly in recent years, reaching the equivalent of 70 percent of GDP, and the
nonperforming loan ratio doubled in 2008.
Belize’s economy is projected to decelerate in 2009 due to the global downturn. Real GDP
growth is projected at 1 percent, reflecting the impact of declining tourism, remittances, and FDI
inflows. Twelve-month inflation is projected to ease to 2½ percent by year-end. The external
current account deficit would contract significantly, as imports are projected to decline more
than exports, mirroring an expected fall in private capital inflows. In FY 2009/10, the overall
balance of the central government is projected to shift from a surplus to a deficit of 1¾ percent
of GDP, on account of a budgeted increase in recurrent spending, while tax revenue is
projected to increase at a slower pace.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the broadly favorable economic performance in 2008, and
commended the authorities’ commitment to pursue sound macroeconomic and financial sector
policies to manage near-term risks and reinvigorate growth potential over the medium term.
Against the backdrop of the global downturn, they noted that Belize, as a small, open economy
with a fixed exchange rate system, a low level of reserves, and a high debt level, remains
vulnerable. Looking ahead, Directors welcomed the authorities’ aim to pursue a medium-term
economic strategy centered on sustained fiscal consolidation, while strengthening their
international reserve position and oversight of the financial sector.
Directors noted that the exchange rate peg has served Belize well, providing an important
anchor for macroeconomic policies. They also noted the staff’s assessment that the exchange
rate appears to be broadly in line with fundamentals. Directors emphasized that strong
macroeconomic policies are necessary to underpin this exchange rate regime and help raise
international reserves to a comfortable level. They also encouraged the authorities to access
additional external financing to contain the risk of a sharper-than-anticipated external
deterioration.
Directors agreed that a more cautious fiscal stance would help protect Belize’s external position
and enhance public debt sustainability by lowering debt ratios over the medium term. They
encouraged the authorities to restrain the growth in public expenditure, including through wage
moderation, while boosting tax revenue aimed at raising the primary surplus and helping reduce
the budget’s reliance on volatile revenue sources. At the same time, they considered as
important protecting outlays for reconstruction and other investment, given their positive supplyside effects.
Directors underscored the need to ensure the medium-term financial viability of key public
sector programs to help secure fiscal sustainability. They considered that the Social Security

3
Board and the pension plan for civil servants should be reformed to put them on a sound
financial footing. Directors agreed that the proposed extension of the National Health Insurance
scheme should await adequate funding and that the mandate of the newly reactivated
Development Finance Corporation needs to be clarified and financing identified to cover its
operating costs. They considered that petroleum revenues should remain integrated in the
budget, with related information published and subject to regular audits to ensure transparency.
Noting the increase in non-performing loans, Directors encouraged the authorities to further
strengthen oversight of the financial system. They underscored the importance of developing
contingency plans for the financial system and devising a framework for the provision of
liquidity. Directors welcomed the strengthening of the Anti-Money Laundering legislation, and
recommended that adequate resources be provided for the Financial Intelligence Unit to allow
its implementation.
Directors endorsed the authorities’ focus on a development strategy to raise Belize’s mediumterm growth potential, which should draw upon private sector as well as donor financing. They
underscored that the public investment program should be consistent with the authorities’
prudent fiscal strategy. Directors commended the authorities’ commitment to good governance,
the rule of law, and contract enforcement, which are important for improving the investment
climate.

Statement by Stephen O'Sullivan, Alternate Executive Director for Belize and
Peter McGoldrick, Advisor to Executive Director
May 8, 2009
On behalf of our Belizean authorities, we express appreciation for the staff’s candid, yet
cordial, approach to the 2009 Article IV Consultations. The authorities are grateful for the
comprehensive analysis offered in the report and they broadly share the conclusions reached.
In particular, they welcome points raised in the seminar organized by the staff and attended
by senior officials from the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economic Development and
the Central Bank of Belize, as well as representatives from the IDB, the CDB and the World
Bank. Useful strategies were outlined during the seminar, the implementation of which could
help Belize to benefit from an eventual improvement in global economic conditions. On
behalf of the authorities, we further express gratitude for the funds released through last
year’s ENDA, which helped alleviate balance of payments pressures and repair damages
sustained during two devastating tropical weather events in 2008.
The smooth transition of power in 2008 underscores the stability of Belize’s democracy. The
opposition party won the February 2008 elections carrying a manifesto that placed good
governance, accountability, and transparency at its core. Furthermore, Government has
pledged its commitment to a strategy that promotes poverty reduction and sustainable growth
and development. In the context of a constrained budgetary position, the authorities fully
understand the implications of trading-off necessary capital expenditure with recurrent
expenditure. They plan to address this constraint to sustained development within the
context of the FY 2010/11 budget exercise.
Output Performance
For 2008, the staff estimates that output growth rebounded to 3 percent. This constitutes a
significant improvement, which exceeds expectations and compares favorably with regional
competitors. It should be recalled that in 2008 Belize was recovering from storm damage in
2007 totaling 3.7 percent of GDP and that it had to deal with further damage sustained by
two weather events in 2008, whose costs are estimated at 5.4 percent of GDP. As staff quite
rightly points out, economic growth in 2008 was, in part, generated from petroleum-related
activities, which, absent new finds, are projected to decline. Nonetheless, most of economic
growth in 2008 came from the non-oil sector. Looking ahead, the global economic
environment has changed in a way that exacerbates many of last year’s challenges. The
authorities share the staff’s view that the deterioration in global economic circumstances will
likely see reduced levels of FDI, remittances and tourism. They are, however, of the opinion
that the rebound in output associated with the recovery from natural disasters could be
somewhat stronger than the staff’s projection of 1 percent economic growth for 2009. In any
event, the achievement of positive output growth in 2009 would constitute a very good
performance in the current global context, especially for a small open economy.
External Reserves
Given that the Belizean dollar is pegged to the US dollar, the authorities agree with the
staff’s assessment that safeguarding the foreign reserve position is a key priority. Over the

2
past years, this continued to improve and now stands at a level twice that of monthly imports.
The authorities believe the level of official foreign reserves can best be further raised by
increasing exports and persevering with efforts aimed at fiscal consolidation, with a view to
reducing debt levels. In the context of safeguarding reserves, a continued vigilance vis-à-vis
the financial sector is of equal importance, both in terms of oversight and, if required, the
provision of liquidity. Indeed, the authorities have in recent times shown sustained
commitment to fiscal consolidation and improved oversight of the financial sector.
Furthermore, they expressed a keen interest in developing new tools and capabilities to
manage liquidity.
As the staff points out, significant challenges have resurfaced during a difficult period
characterized by highly changeable global economic conditions, the transition of a new
Government and three devastating tropical weather events in the past two years. Under these
circumstances, a certain degree of moderation of the usual fiscal discipline is necessary.
Furthermore, a successful restructuring of commercial external debt in February 2007 has
afforded the authorities an opportunity to continue decreasing the debt ratio, even if the debt
burden remains relatively high. The current account deficit is expected to narrow
considerably this year after it widened last year. Last year’s widening was chiefly driven by
high food and oil prices, as well as FDI inflows, which focused on infrastructure
improvement. Finally, while Belize has not passed unscathed through volatile global
economic conditions, last year’s overall growth performance buttressed by revenues from
growing oil extraction was unequivocally solid.
Fiscal Policy
Over the recent past, Belize’s fiscal balance has consistently improved resulting in significant
surpluses in the three years leading up to FY 2007/08. In a challenging FY 2008/09,
estimates point to a further increase in the surplus. On the revenue side, grants and oil
revenue have contributed significantly to the recent increase in revenues. These are, however,
expected to decline to about 1.5 percent of GDP going forward. Recognizing the need to
strengthen other revenue sources, the authorities have stepped up efforts to (i) enhance audit
procedures in General Sales Tax collection; (ii) finalize computerization of revenue
collection; (iii) strengthen the operations of the customs department; and (iv) tackle the
problem with contraband by providing additional human and financial resources.
Additionally, in the wake of the fall in global oil prices, the authorities re-introduced a levy
on fuel that should add US$15million to revenues. They agree that oil prices have been
volatile in recent years. Given the currently low prices, however, it would appear that any
increase in volatility would likely provide increases in petroleum-related revenue.
Expenditure increases, on the other hand, were largely on essential expenditure for health,
education and security. They also included increases in personal emoluments to reinstate
public officers’ increments which were frozen for the year 2005.
Following a significant debt restructuring and the implementation of a prudent policy
approach that is committed to halving the debt by 2019, Moody’s upgraded Belize’s
sovereign debt to B3 in mid-February. At eighty percent, the public debt ratio remains high,
even if it has fallen significantly since FY 2003/04. Likewise, the debt burden has in recent
years fallen to manageable levels. Nonetheless, the authorities are well aware of the

3
significant coupon resets that were prescribed in the restructuring and fully accept the
implications of staff’s analysis that further significant fiscal consolidation is required in order
to remain on course. In recognition of the relatively high debt levels, thin reserves and
susceptibility to external shocks, the authorities concur that good relations with the
international community are important and Belize has more recently renewed its commitment
to furthering relations with official lenders, such as the IDB, CDB, and the WB, which have
pledged a sum of US$45mn for the development of the country.
In its report, the staff identifies certain public sector programs for which sustainable funding
should be secured prior to further roll-out, lest they become a drain on public finances. While
the authorities do not envisage rolling these out any further at this stage, they welcome the
staff’s suggestions regarding potential funding sources. Furthermore, the authorities broadly
agree that there is an urgent need to identify additional lines of credit to ensure sustained
growth of the Development Finance Corporation portfolio.
Structural Reforms
As outlined in the 2007 agenda, reforms are ongoing and the authorities aim to raise and
diversify revenues, while they continue to improve the effectiveness of expenditure. With a
Technical Assistance loan from the CDB, steps are being undertaken to strengthen and
modernize the Customs & Excise Department. Furthermore, efforts are being undertaken in
collaboration with the WB, IDB, and CDB to improve public financial management. In
addition to the strengthening and modernization of the Customs Department, the CDB is
advising on the implementation of multi-year budgeting, the upgrade and strengthening of
public financial regulation rules and procedures and the improvement of macroeconomic
forecasting. The IDB is providing assistance with the definition and implementation of an
Action Plan on the key recommendations coming out of the PEFA Exercise, which was
undertaken in conjunction with the EU in order to enhance the quality of public expenditure.
The World Bank is working, in conjunction with the IDB, to improve the quality of public
procurement and is providing assistance to build the institutional capacity of the Auditor
General’s Office. Regarding efforts to improve monetary management, a proposal for
improved CBB liquidity management is pending approval. In response to the team’s
suggestion, the Income Tax Department is seeking to improve its capacity to audit
investment and revenues in the petroleum industry. The authorities have acted quickly and
requested technical assistance from the Government of Trinidad and Tobago in this matter.
As regards transparency of oil revenues, all oil revenues are included in the budget and
deposited to the Consolidated Revenue Fund.
Financial System
To date, the financial system of Belize has remained generally isolated from the global
financial crisis. As the staff points out, the authorities have stepped-up their efforts at
monitoring local banks and these, in conjunction with a tightening of standards, largely
explain the sudden rise in NPL recorded in the data. The CBB has been closely monitoring
liquidity in the financial sector and intends to be proactive on the development of
contingency plans for the banking system. Notwithstanding the current ample levels of
liquidity in the system, the authorities accept that a fall in exports, remittances and FDI over

4
the next year could lead to increased risk of liquidity problems. They feel that these risks will
be mitigated, to a large degree, by a narrowing of the current account deficit. Hence, extant
liquidity management tools should suffice in order to attain external reserves goals.
Nonetheless, the authorities welcome any forthcoming suggestions for new liquidity
mechanisms and facilities that would also help reduce spreads and develop the interbank
market. The authorities will remain vigilant with regard to the insurance sector. Naturally,
enhanced credit lines help forestall potential fallout from the financial sector.
Inflation and Competitiveness
As the rest of the world, Belize was exposed to unusually high price volatility in recent years
that largely originated outside the country, especially with regard to food and petroleum
products. With the significant fall in prices since 2008 Q4, inflation is low and is expected to
remain so. The exchange rate is pegged and, despite a period of high inflation last year, the
trend has been for the REER to depreciate. Overall, the real exchange rate is thought to be
generally in line with fundamentals. Competitiveness could be further enhanced by
infrastructure investment and would also benefit from a lower cost of finance. Hence, further
structural reform is required as well as the introduction of improved monetary policy tools.
Furthermore, increased participation of the private sector in investment projects is desirable.
Other Issues
Belize has taken many important measures to improve the quality and timeliness of its data
and remains committed to improving both. Further, the Statistical Institute of Belize plans to
introduce a new CPI in 2010 that better reflects the consumer basket.
Conclusion
In recent years, Belize has shown much willingness and initiative to overcome many
structural issues that have hindered its development. As a small, open economy with a fixed
exchange rate, low levels of reserves and high levels of indebtedness, Belize remains
vulnerable to exogenous shocks. The authorities appreciate the support provided by the
international community to help address the impact of these shocks. They remain resolutely
committed to take the required steps to protect the external reserve position and consolidate
the budget. Hence, they are confident that Belize can be steered onto and on a course of
sustainable development through these difficult times of transition.
