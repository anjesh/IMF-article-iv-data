Executive Summary
The South African economy appears poised for a recovery in activity. Monetary easing
last year, a moderately expansionary fiscal stance, increases in investment, and a pickup in
external demand should provide a boost to the economy. As a result, growth is expected to
rise from under 2 percent in 2003 to more than 2½ percent in 2004 and to over 3 percent in
2005.
The South African Reserve Bank (SARB) eased monetary conditions in 2003 in
response to a major improvement in the inflation outlook. CPIX inflation has been within
the official target range of 3-6 percent since September 2003, and short-term interest rates
were cut by 550 basis points between June and December 2003, and by another 50 basis
points in mid-August. However, there is evidence of a modest buildup in inflationary
pressures, and an adjustment in interest rates may be required during the next 12 months.
South Africa’s external position has generally strengthened over the past year. The rand
has strengthened further, largely reflecting increases in commodity prices. A major milestone
was reached with the closure of the SARB’s forward book in the foreign exchange market in
February 2004, and the SARB has since replenished its net international reserves.
Nonetheless, some further increase in reserves would be desirable in order to help reduce
currency volatility and keep long-term interest rates low. In response to strong domestic
demand and the currency appreciation, the external current account position turned around
from a surplus of 0.6 percent of GDP in 2002 to a deficit of 0.8 percent of GDP in 2003; the
external debt situation, however, remains very comfortable.
The fiscal stance has been relaxed to provide countercyclical support and help address
South Africa’s pressing social problems. The deficit for 2004/05 is targeted at 3.1 percent
of GDP, compared with outturns of 2.4 percent of GDP in 2003/04 and 1.1 percent 2002/03.
The authorities agree that a deficit in the region of 3 percent of GDP should be considered
the upper limit of what is desirable to maintain macroeconomic stability and to keep
indebtedness under control. An important spending initiative that has been adopted is the
universal provision of antiretroviral HIV/AIDS drugs through the public health system.
Key prudential indicators suggest that the banking and corporate sectors are generally
sound. Real estate prices have risen strongly in recent years, but the banks appear to be well
protected against the consequences of a possible drop in property prices.
Rigidities, skill deficiencies, and relatively high costs in the labor market continue to
impede efforts to achieve a significant reduction in unemployment. The staff
recommends that steps be considered to decentralize the collective bargaining system so as to
allow small and medium-sized enterprises more autonomy in setting wages. It is, moreover,
concerned that increases in minimum wages have aggravated the unemployment problem,
particularly in the agricultural sector. The government’s skills development program could be
strengthened by relying less on labor levies as a source of funding and by focusing more on
training those presently unemployed.

-5-

Policies in the areas of trade reform and public enterprise restructuring are being
reviewed by the government. The staff urges that further liberalization of the tariff regime
be undertaken and that implementation of the privatization program, which has come to a
halt, be stepped up. These actions would help raise productivity and enhance South Africa’s
international competitiveness.
The implementation of initiatives that reduce income and wealth disparities is necessary
and desirable for maintaining social cohesion. Initiatives being undertaken to implement a
black economic empowerment program and accelerate land reform are, therefore, welcome.

I. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

x

After picking up in 2002, the pace of economic activity slowed in 2003, with real GDP
growth slipping from 3.6 percent to 1.9 percent. More recently, however, growth appears
to be regaining momentum as a result of supportive monetary and fiscal policies and
stronger global economic conditions.

x

Strong domestic demand growth and a currency appreciation have led to a deterioration
in the external current account position. But much progress has been made in
strengthening the central bank’s international reserve position.

x

Short-term interest rates were lowered by 550 basis points in 2003. Inflation remains well
within the SARB’s 3-6 percent target range, but there are indications that modest
inflationary pressure may be building.

x

The budget is set on a mildly expansionary track, due mainly to higher social and
infrastructure expenditures.

x

Despite a drop in the official rate of unemployment, limited progress has been made in job
creation.

Growth slowed in 2003 to 1.9 percent
from 3.6 percent in 2002, despite strong
domestic demand. Fueled by low interest rates,
a more expansionary fiscal stance, and the wealth
effects from strong commodity and property
price increases, domestic expenditures rose
strongly in 2003. But the increase in aggregate
demand did not translate into higher growth,
largely because of a strong currency appreciation
and weakening current account performance
(Figures 1-6).

2.
Developments so far in 2004 point to a rebound in growth. Real GDP grew by
3.1 percent in the first quarter of 2004 (quarter-on-quarter, annualized), and a range of
indicators, such as retail sales, and consumer and business confidence indices, point to an
acceleration in activity. The recovery, moreover, appears to be broadly based; following a
year of contraction, the primary and secondary sectors are expanding, while services, which
have been the backbone of growth in South Africa in recent years, continue to perform well.

-7-

3.
Job growth has remained weak. Increases in wage rates during 2003 were well in
excess of productivity gains and inflation, and thereby dampened labor demand. There has,
however, been a sharp drop in the number of people looking for work, and, as a consequence,
the official rate of unemployment fell to 28.2 percent in September 2003 from 31.2 percent in
March 2003.1
4.
The rand has continued to strengthen in value. The currency has now appreciated
by over 50 percent in real effective terms since the end of the large currency depreciation in
December 2001. This strength primarily reflects an unwinding of the overshooting in 2001,
160
the impact of strong rises in commodity prices,

and an increase in global appetite for emerging

the overall pace of activity in 2003, despite an expansion in fixed capital formation of over
8 percent.

5.
Inflation has subsided over the past 18 months. The strength of the rand, monetary
tightening in 2002, and falling food prices contributed to a decline in inflation from a peak of
over 10 percent in October 2002 to 4.4 percent in May 2004; this is well within the SARB’s
target range of 3–6 percent.2 In response to the improved inflation outlook, the SARB eased
credit conditions and reduced the repurchase rate by 550 basis points to 8.0 percent during
the course of 2003 and by another 50 basis points in mid-August.
6.
Foreign exchange inflows have also helped the SARB continue to build up its net
international reserve position. The SARB has purchased foreign exchange in the market,
which, together with the proceeds from external borrowing by the government, enabled it to
close its open position in the forward market in February 2004. This exposure had
represented a major source of external vulnerability and macroeconomic instability. The

increase in net international reserves contributed to a substantial decline in sovereign risk

Box 1. South Africa—The Sources of Rand Strength

Between the first quarter of 2002 and the first quarter of 2004, the rand appreciated in real effective
terms by 37 percent. This reflected a number of factors. Staff analysis suggests that the exchange rate
considerably overshot in value during the large currency depreciation toward the end of 2001, and that around
25 percent of the subsequent recovery in value of the

The impact of commodity price increases on the exchange rate appears to have taken place primarily through
wealth and terms of trade effects that have boosted aggregate demand and imports. As a consequence, the
increase in commodity prices, combined with weak overseas demand for manufactured products, has been
associated with a weakening of the current account and a crowding out of the traded goods sector. The impact
on the current account, and growth more generally, has been characterized by a relatively weak supply
response of precious metal exports, particularly gold, to the price increases. Part of this weak response
corresponds to a secular decline in gold production, but it also reflects a fall in prices in rand terms.
The rand has also strengthened as a result of an increase in global appetite for emerging market debt. The
expansionary stance of fiscal policy has contributed to the real appreciation by raising aggregate demand and
propping up long-term interest rates; however, the exchange rate impact of this stance has been offset by
successive cuts in short-term interest rates.
In sum, it is the staff’s view that the level of the rand is broadly in line with long-run equilibrium values
indicated by macroeconomic fundamentals. This assessment is, however, based on a continuation of the
current high level of commodity prices, particularly for platinum and gold.

The sovereign risk spread on South African debt has shrunk by 550 basis points since October
1998, when the SARB’s open position in the forward market peaked at US$23 billion. An
empirical study undertaken by the staff estimates that 230 points of this reduction was
attributable to the reduction and closure of the forward book. Increased global appetite for risk, as
captured by movements in the EMBI+, accounted for 310 points of the reduction. A reduction in
domestic public debt contributed to a reduction in spread of over 100 basis points but was partly
offset by the impact of an increase in the foreign debt stock.

Box 2. Long-Term Interest Rates in South Africa: Country Risk and Currency Premiums
Long-term interest rates in South Africa have been declining in recent years from historically high levels (see figure below).
While sentiment in emerging markets has generally improved, an analysis of the determinants of the country risk premium and the
currency premium suggests that the improvement in macroeconomic
Interest Rates in South Africa

performance has contributed significantly to the decline in long-term
1
interest rates. Empirical results suggest that a further increase in
Long-term South African Interest Rate
reserves, a sustained reduction in inflation expectations, and a reduction 15
in the stock of debt may further help ease pressures on long-term interest
rates.
10

For a small open economy, such as South Africa, with a large and welldeveloped financial sector and a relatively open capital account (at least
for nonresidents), arbitrage conditions imply that the long-term domestic
interest rate will be determined by, in addition to foreign interest rates,
the country risk premium and the currency premium. 2

Determinants of the country risk premium (spread)
An econometric study, consistent with the domestic fundamentals used by rating agencies and, based on monthly data for the period
1997-2003, indicates that emerging-market lending conditions, foreign exchange reserves, growth, and exchange rate changes
significantly affect the country risk premium:
x Spreads in other emerging markets affect South African spreads, although less than proportionally. The elasticity of the
South African spread with respect to the EMBI spread is approximately 0.8, implying that a reduction in emerging market
spreads by 10 percent will tend to be accompanied by a narrowing of the South African spread of 8 percent. This
nonproportional effect suggests that the potential for contagion in South Africa may be somewhat less than for other emergingmarket economies.
x Higher foreign exchange reserves, or lower short-term external liabilities, will lead to a reduction in the spread. For
example, a 10 percent increase in the stock of gross foreign reserves, or in the ratio of gross foreign reserves to short-term debt
(including the SARB’s forward book), narrows the spread by around 5 percent.
x An increase in real GDP growth by 1 percentage point will result in a reduction in spreads of 7-12 percent.
x An appreciation of the exchange rate of 1 percent is associated with a 1 percent decline in spreads.
Determinants of the currency premium
The currency premium is strongly influenced by the inflation differential and the stock of domestic debt
x The expected inflation differential, measured as the difference between break-even inflation rates in South Africa and
the United States, is a key driver of the currency premium. The elasticity of the premium with respect to inflation
expectations is around 1. Thus, a further improvement in inflation performance in South Africa should lead to a corresponding
reduction in the currency premium and long-term interest rates.
x A decline in the domestic debt stock reduces the currency premium. A larger stock of domestic debt may increase the
incentive for inflationary financing and raise the currency premium. The study finds that an increase in the ratio of domestic
debt to GDP of 1 percentage point raises the currency premium by 2-3 percent.
______________________

Currency premium refers to the difference between the domestic currency and foreign currency borrowing costs. It reflects the
compensation for expected exchange rate depreciation and exchange rate risk.
2
Long-term domestic interest rates are from South African government bonds with a maturity of ten years or longer. The country

risk premium (spread) is computed as the difference between yields from South African dollar-denominated and U.S. bonds
maturing in 2017.

- 10 7.
Fiscal policy was eased in 2003/04 (April-March) to provide countercyclical
support and to increase outlays on social services. The budget deficit increased to
2.4 percent of GDP from 1.1 percent in 2002/03, reflecting an increase in social spending
(mainly in the form of targeted grants) of 1.3 percent of GDP. A higher-than-expected civil
service pay settlement, reflecting the backward-looking nature of wage demands by trade
unions, was offset by the impact of lower interest rates on debt-service payments.
Recent Political Developments
The ANC has dominated the political scene since winning the 1994 general election. In April
2004, it achieved a landslide victory with nearly 70 percent of the vote in South Africa’s third
democratic elections. President Mbeki was inaugurated for a second term. Most ministerial positions
remained unchanged. The ANC now has a sufficient majority in the national parliament to amend the
constitution with the exception of certain sections that define the values upon which South Africa is a
sovereign democratic state. The ANC has, however, indicated that it does not intend to make any
constitutional amendment. It has also taken control of all nine provincial legislatures for the first time,
either singly or as the majority coalition partner. The ANC continues to participate in a formal
coalition with the Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) and the South African
Communist Party.

II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Background and Outlook
8.
The government has overcome major political hurdles in making the transition
from apartheid and has resisted pressure to use the budget primarily for redistributing
income. In the process, South Africa has made considerable progress in stabilizing the
economy and laying the foundation for higher growth. The public finances have been
strengthened significantly, inflation has been brought firmly under control, real interest rates
have been lowered, and the external position has improved. In addition, the economy has
been exposed to greater competition through trade liberalization and deregulation. As a
result, the average rate of economic growth has more than doubled to just under 3 percent
since the end of apartheid in 1994. There have been corresponding improvements in many of
the social indicators, although performance in some areas has been impeded by the severity
of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Progress in meeting the Millennium Development Goals has
been mixed (Table 8).

9.
Near-term prospects for the South African economy are encouraging.4 A pickup
in global economic activity, low interest rates, and a mildly expansionary budget for 2004/05
underlie a projected rise in growth to 2.6 percent for 2004 and 3.3 percent in 2005.5 This
outlook is supported by positive developments in indicators such as retail sales, consumer
and business confidence, and manufacturing production. The main risk to the outlook relates
to a continuation of the high pace of pay settlements, which have been running at around
8–9 percent. A continuation of settlements at these levels, while not likely beyond the end of
this year, could undermine the recovery and the inflation-targeting strategy. Higher oil prices
or further currency appreciation could also put a brake on the recovery.6
10.
The stabilization effort is now largely complete, but South Africa faces
formidable long-term challenges in the form of high unemployment and widespread
poverty. Much of the task of raising growth and employment must rely on initiatives that
boost labor demand and factor productivity, such as labor market reforms, the enhancement
of job skills, and further steps in the areas of trade liberalization and privatization. At the
same time, the incidence of HIV/AIDS has raised the cost of doing business in South Africa,
and concerted action will be needed to contain the social and economic repercussions of the
disease. South Africa’s acute income and wealth inequalities are a potential source of social
strain, and visible progress in pushing forward with land redistribution and black economic
empowerment will help address these inequalities.
11.
The Fund’s advice to South Africa in recent years has focused on the central
policy challenge of achieving higher growth and lowering unemployment. The
authorities have generally taken an open and responsive approach to macroeconomic issues,
particularly in the areas of inflation targeting, the management of international reserves, and
fiscal policy. In other areas, however, notably the labor market, the need to build a consensus
with social stakeholders and other partners in the governing coalition has constrained the
speed at which difficult economic reforms can be undertaken.

For a discussion of the medium-term outlook, see Appendix IV.

Statistics South Africa is rebasing and benchmarking the national accounts. For example,
manufacturing production, which accounts for 18 percent of GDP, is now based on a new,
expanded business register, and this will likely result in an upward revision of GDP. Revised
data will be released at the end of November 2004.
6

Staff and SARB estimates suggest that the direct impact of an increase of US$10 per barrel
in crude oil prices could lead to an increase of CPIX inflation of some 0.7 percentage point
and a reduction in growth of 0.2 percentage point.

B. Macroeconomic Policies
Inflation targeting and interest rate policy
12.
Low and predictable inflation is necessary for financial stability and sustained
economic growth; it also provides protection for the more vulnerable in society. The
progress made in bringing down inflation to well around the midpoint of the SARB’s target
range of 3–6 percent is commendable and has paved the way for a significant reduction in
short-term interest rates. Sustained success in inflation targeting will very much depend on
the central bank’s further bolstering its credibility. The mission, therefore, endorsed
various changes that have been made over the past year to the inflation-targeting
regime:
x

The inflation objective was changed from an annual average target to a rolling
monthly target in November 2003. In addition, the “escape” clause was removed;7
instead, the SARB is now governed by an “explanation” clause, whereby it must
explain deviations from the inflation target and indicate how it intends to bring
inflation back on track. These innovations make it easier for the public to understand
the inflation-targeting process and subject the SARB to continuous and more stringent
accountability.

x

The frequency of Monetary Policy Committee meetings was increased from four to six
per year. This will allow for a more continuous flow of information to the public,
reduce the risk of surprises, and enable the central bank to make smaller and more
frequent adjustments in interest rates.

13.
The mission noted that inflation pressures appeared to be building from a
number of sources, although these pressures were at present limited in intensity; some
increase in interest rates may be needed over the forthcoming 12 months. Aggregate
demand growth is outstripping supply, and monetary expansion has been somewhat in excess
of nominal income growth.8 Moreover, the deflationary impact of the appreciation of the
rand will likely dissipate before the end of the year, and import prices at the wholesale level
are likely to rise in line with international inflation, after falling by 4 percent over the past
year. The relatively high level of pay settlements is also likely to add to price pressures, as
could the second-round effects of oil price increases.
14.
Because of the inherent volatility of inflation and credibility considerations, the
mission suggested that the SARB aim to keep projected inflation at a rate closer to the
7

The escape clause could be invoked when inflation exceeded the target because of spurts in
oil and food prices and currency changes “unrelated to domestic economic fundamentals and
domestic monetary policy.”

Empirical work undertaken by the staff indicates that the income elasticity of money
demand is in the region of unity.

midpoint of the band. This would increase the likelihood of meeting the inflation target.
The long-term benefits of fully establishing central bank credibility and bringing price and
wage-setting behavior onto a more forward-looking basis probably outweigh any potential
short-term output costs that may arise from lowering inflation.
15.
The real estate market has been extremely buoyant in recent years. Property
prices rose by approximately 35 percent between January 2003 and June 2004. This increase
hides substantial regional disparities (Box 3).9 Stress tests conducted by the SARB suggest
that the banks are resilient to potentially adverse developments in the real estate market. In
particular, SARB officials noted that mortgage debt had fallen relative to the value of
collateral. Vulnerability would, however, rise if increases in interest rates were to accompany
a fall in property prices.
External vulnerability and exchange rate policy
16.
The mission commended the authorities on the considerable progress made in
strengthening South Africa’s international reserve position. The SARB’s open position in
the forward market had been closed and net international reserves increased. Nevertheless,
the mission noted that, compared with other emerging-market economies, South Africa’s
stock of reserves remained relatively low, and a further accretion of reserves to levels
comfortably above the stock of short-term external debt would likely help reduce currency
volatility and lower spreads.10
17.
The SARB has publicly indicated that it will not intervene in the foreign
exchange market, other than to replenish its international reserves. In particular, it will
not seek to target the exchange rate. The mission agreed with this strategy. Sterilized
intervention on a sustained basis that aimed to induce a currency depreciation would be
largely self-defeating and could undermine the inflation-targeting strategy.
18.
South Africa has managed its external debt prudently. Official medium- and longterm external debt presently stands at less than 10 percent of GDP, and the authorities intend
to keep it at this level for the foreseeable future. Market confidence in South Africa’s debt
management, and in its macroeconomic policies more generally, was reflected in the success
in May 2004 of an international bond issue of US$1 billion that was heavily
oversubscribed.11

The 2004 Article IV Selected Issues paper analyzes in greater depth property price
developments and the potential role of monetary policy.
10

As of end-June gross reserves stood at US$11.4 billion, while short-term debt is estimated
at around US$11 billion.
11

The bond was issued in New York and included collective action clauses. As with a similar
issue in May 2003, there appears to have been no additional cost associated with the
inclusion of these clauses.

Box 3. Real Estate Prices and Monetary Policy1/
Real estate values in South Africa have risen strongly over the past 18 months. Property prices have increased by
18 percent per year since end-1999, which has been among the highest in the world. This begs the question of whether there is a
risk of an emerging bubble in house prices and whether a
slump in property prices pose a risk for the banking sector.

Real estate prices and economic development
Rate of growth,
Asset price fluctuations may affect the real economy
through their effect on consumption (via wealth changes),
investment, and banks’ balance sheets. The latter may give
rise to major risks. A rise in property and other asset prices
increases a borrowers available collateral and, hence, a
lender’s willingness to supply credit. At the same time,
higher debt may increase a borrower’s incentive to pursue
more risky projects. Under these circumstances, a
subsequent decline in net worth, for example as a result of
falling property prices, may set into motion effects that
could cause bank distress, and lead to a credit crunch and
financial instability.

The extent of property price increases—a bubble?
It is, of course, difficult to distinguish asset price booms driven by fundamentals from pure price bubbles, Empirical work
undertaken on industrial countries suggests that an asset price boom period is more likely to be followed by an asset price
collapse, with adverse economic consequences, if the boom in asset prices is (a) largely driven by a boom in residential
property prices exceeding past trend levels by some 10 percent in real terms and (b) characterized by some easing of monetary
policy and strong real credit growth.2
Although economic developments in South Africa may share some of these characteristics, at this stage, there are no clear
indications of a bubble having developed. Available data suggest that real estate prices rose from very low levels and there are
significant regional disparities. In addition, a number of special factors appear to account for the large increase in prices,
including increased demand from an emerging black middle class, foreign interest in coastal resort areas, and a switch by smallscale investors from other asset classes to real estate.
Coverage of the banking sector
At present, the banking sector in South Africa, which finances most real estate transactions, appears reasonably well protected
against a possible drop in property prices:
x The mortgage debt of households has grown significantly less rapidly than the market value of housing: the ratio of
household debt to the market value of housing shrank to 42 percent in 2003 from 58 percent in 1999.
x Banks are well capitalized. The average risk-weighted capital-adequacy ratio stood at 12.2 percent at the end of December
2003. Net nonperforming loans (nonperforming loans less specific provisions) were only 2.4 percent of total loans.
x Banking sector stocks have outperformed the total market index since 2003.

19.
The mission expressed support for the gradual approach the government had
adopted in relaxing capital controls. The budget for 2004/05 announced some additional,
but relatively small, steps to relax controls on resident and nonresident companies. The
current strength of the rand and completion of an exchange control amnesty present an
opportune time to move ahead in further easing the controls that remain; these relate
primarily to unit trusts (mutual funds) and resident companies.12
Fiscal policy
20.
The mission noted that prudent fiscal policy, in conjunction with structural
budgetary reforms, had been the cornerstone of the stabilization effort in the postapartheid period. Relatively small budget deficits and effective tax administration and
expenditure control had restored confidence in economic management, contributed to a
reduction in sovereign risk spreads, and helped reduce the public debt burden. Savings from
lower debt-service payments had been channeled to increased spending on social welfare and
economic infrastructure. Fiscal adjustment had also helped dampen price pressures and
strengthen international competitiveness.
21.
The budget for 2004/05 provides for a relaxation of the fiscal stance. The deficit
is projected to widen from 2.4 percent of GDP in 2003/04 to 3.1 percent in 2004/05, before
falling back below 3 percent of GDP in 2006/07. The budget contains no major tax policy
changes, although modest personal income tax relief has been provided through partial
bracket adjustments. Major expenditure initiatives include a plan for the universal provision
of antiretroviral HIV/AIDS drugs (ARVs) and a further extension of targeted child support
grants to older children. Additional outlays are also envisaged for the black economic
empowerment (BEE) program, land reform, criminal justice, and the provision of free basic
utilities to poor households. In addition, the budget launched a labor-intensive public works
program intended to create 1 million temporary jobs for the unemployed over five years at a
cost of around 0.2 percent of GDP per year.13 The larger deficit is expected to lead to a small
increase in public debt relative to GDP, although the debt level should remain below
40 percent of GDP over the medium term. Debt dynamics appear manageable under a range
of short-term shocks (Appendix IV).

12

The exchange control amnesty allowed individuals with excess funds abroad before endFebruary 2003 to file for an exchange control and income tax amnesty; the amnesty closed in
February 2004. Individuals filing for the exchange control amnesty are released from all civil
penalties and criminal liabilities. Applicants may pay a 5 percent levy on repatriated
holdings, or maintain investments abroad and pay 10 percent. The investments will enter the
income tax base from 2004/05 onward.
13

One million net new jobs would reduce the unemployment rate by 6 percentage points.

- 16 -

22.
The mission expressed support for the stance of fiscal policy. It noted, however,
that allowing the deficit to rise much above 3 percent of GDP could place undue pressure on
long-term interest rates and the rand, and it could lead to an unwelcome increase in public
debt. The authorities agreed with this assessment and pointed to the possibility of budgetary
overperformance in 2004/05. They considered the revenue estimates to be conservative
because they did not include the impact of further tax administration improvements or
revenues from the exchange control amnesty. Moreover, preliminary indications suggested
that there may be underspending on the new expenditure initiatives. Expenditure
management efforts need to build on recent reforms at the national and provincial levels. It
will be essential to improve the identification of measurable objectives and their linkage to
spending requests, strengthen rolling three-year strategic plans, and improve the timeliness
and coverage of reporting.
23.
If it became necessary to absorb spending pressures in the future, the mission
felt that additional resources should be raised through an increase in the tax effort or
cuts in spending on lower priority outlays. Largely because of equity considerations and
the regressive nature of indirect rates, any increase in the tax effort would probably be best
borne by income tax adjustments, although there may be some scope for increasing non-oil
excise duties. The mission felt that recourse to tax breaks and investment allowances to
support social programs, such as black economic empowerment, should be avoided; not only
would this raise the deficit and borrowing requirement, but it could distort the tax system and
undermine the transparency of fiscal operations.
C. Structural Issues
Financial and corporate sectors
24.
Key macro-prudential indicators for South Africa’s financial system are at
healthy levels. The banks remain well capitalized, with a mean capital adequacy ratio above
12 percent. Nonperforming loans represent only 2 percent of total loans and advances, and
the foreign exposure of the banks is low. There has been little contagion so far from the
distress experienced in the banking sector in neighboring Zimbabwe.
25.
Steps are being considered to strengthen bank supervision. The Treasury and
SARB are jointly reviewing the merits of establishing a single regulator by unifying the
supervisory functions of the SARB and the Financial Services Board, which oversees
financial markets and the nonbank financial institutions. The review will draw upon the
experience of other countries. On the basis of recommendations made in the Financial Sector
Assessment Program (FSAP) in 2000, the staff urged that issues relating to the availability of
skilled personnel be addressed prior to any unification.
26.
Efforts continue to broaden and deepen the financial system and to address gaps
in the regulatory framework. SARB is revising draft legislation on a new, second tier of

- 17 -

banks that will aim to attract deposits from the large unbanked population.14 The rand has
been accepted as a clearing currency by the Continuous Link Settlement (CLS) Bank in
London since November 2003, providing for a mitigation of time-zone settlement risk.
Participation in the CLS has improved counter-party relations and should increase confidence
in the banking system.15 In March 2004, the SARB published its first Financial Stability
Review, which will monitor developments in the financial system and help identify potential
risks. South Africa has developed a comprehensive legal structure to combat money
laundering and became a member of the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering
(FATF) in June 2003.16 The AML requirement for banks to reidentify all 21 million account
holders has been postponed, due to capacity constraints, from July 1, 2004 to September
2006, with the provision that high-risk clients be identified by December 31, 2004. In
addition to the verification of the clients, increased emphasis needs to be placed on
identifying the “beneficial owners” of the accounts.17
27.
The corporate sector also appears to be in good health. Indebtedness is relatively
low and declining, while cash flow and liquidity indicators are favorable. Corporate
profitability is at levels comparable to those in other emerging markets. Nevertheless, the
sector is subject to some vulnerability relating to the large share of interest-sensitive shortterm debt held by the corporate sector and the impact that any increase in real interest rates
may have on debt-service costs and profitability. The emergence of a corporate bond market
in South Africa over the past several years should make it easier for large corporations to
gradually shift to longer-term bond financing.

14

As the proposals stand, these banks will be required to invest deposits in high-grade paper,
such as government bonds.
15

The authorities also announced that hitherto-unregulated foreign exchange brokers would
be regulated under the Financial Services Act effective July 31, 2004.
16

A Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) for anti-money laundering
and combating the financing of terrorism (AMC/CFT) was issued on April 24, 2004, Country
Report No. 04/119.
17

Banks and other “accountable institutions” are developing a risk matrix to deal with cases
where a rule-based approach (e.g., ID cards, proof of address) cannot be applied to verify
clients’ identities, as required under the Finance Intelligence Centre Act (FICA) passed in
May 2003.

Labor market
28.
The persistence of chronically high unemployment is arguably the single most
important impediment to poverty reduction in South Africa. The high unemployment
rate is the result of a number of factors, most notably a serious skills mismatch, which is
largely the legacy of apartheid, and institutional rigidities that have kept labor costs at
artificially high levels relative to the cost of capital. The government recognizes the social
impact of unemployment and has set a target of halving the unemployment rate by 2014. This
is an ambitious goal that will, the mission argued, require the adoption of labor market and
education reforms to raise job skills and labor demand.
29.
The mission noted that progress had been made in skills enhancement. Execution
of the Skills Development Program (SDP) gained some momentum over the past year, and
many of the original targets will likely be met. The SDP nevertheless continues to suffer
from a number of drawbacks. In particular, it is funded by a levy on labor, which serves to
depress labor demand; this problem has been exacerbated by a low take-up of training
rebates.18 Moreover, the program focuses primarily on training those who already have jobs,
rather than the unemployed; it is the latter who typically encounter the most difficulty in
finding jobs.
30.
The mission expressed support for the new labor-intensive public works
program. Both the authorities and the mission agreed that it would not have a major direct
impact on long-term employment, but could provide a useful vehicle for temporarily
expanding job opportunities and offering skills training for the unemployed.
18

The labor levy, which applies to all but the smallest of businesses, is set at 1 percent. Of
this, up to 70 percent may be transferred back to the employers as a rebate, in most
circumstances, upon the completion of certified training.

- 19 -

31.
South Africa’s collective bargaining system is relatively centralized. Agreements
on minimum wages struck between trade unions and the largest employers are extended by
law to small and medium-sized businesses. These businesses are the most important potential
source of labor absorption in South Africa but have little autonomy in setting wages that
reflect productivity differences. The mission repeated its call, therefore, for a relaxation of
the extension principle in order to reduce labor costs and create new jobs.19
32.
The application of employment-standard minimum wages appears to have led to
job losses.20 Recent increases in minimum wages have been well above the prevailing
inflation rate and are likely to further aggravate unemployment, particularly in rural areas,
where the problem is most acute. While recognizing the importance of protecting the living
standards of those who are already employed, the mission urged that the setting of minimum
wages place greater emphasis on job creation.
33.
The costs of dismissing and retrenching workers constitute a significant
proportion of the total labor costs facing businesses and, therefore, act as a deterrent to
the recruitment of new workers. Legislative amendments passed in 2002 have helped
streamline reconciliation and arbitration procedures, but serious bottlenecks remain. This is
recognized within government, and steps are being considered to further simplify procedures.
An ongoing examination of the labor market commissioned by the Fund staff looks at
possible steps, such as making dismissal appeals optional. Most important, these will not
require legislative changes.
Trade policy
34.
The country is moving ahead with trade liberalization. It has been a vocal and
effective participant in the Doha round of the World Trade Organization (WTO), pushing in
particular for the removal of agricultural subsidies in industrial countries. It is negotiating a
number of bilateral trade agreements (including with the United States) and is also pushing
forward with tariff reform on a unilateral basis.
35.
Extensive trade reform liberalization undertaken since the early 1990s has been
a major source of total factor productivity (TFP) growth, helped lower input costs and
consumer prices, and improved competitiveness. The average tariff (unweighted) was
reduced from 22 percent in1988 to an estimated 11 percent in 2003. The tariff structure,
however, is highly complex, and a number of sectors, such as textiles and footwear, remain
highly protected. The Department of Trade and Industry is of developing proposals for a
19

Empirical evidence gathered by the staff suggests that evasion of minimum wage settings
by both large and small enterprises may be widespread; evasion, however, is itself likely to
be costly, which underscores the need for more flexibility in this area.
20

These wages are set by the Minister of Labor in a number of sectors (agriculture, retail,
and domestic service) that are not covered by bargaining agreements.

- 20 -

further simplification of tariffs that will involve a significant reduction in the number of
bands (these are presently around 50) and the application of ad valorem rates for most items.
Changes in the tariffs of the South African Customs (SACU) must be approved by a new
regional tariff board.21 The mission suggested that the number of tariff bands be compressed
to perhaps three; this would provide an opportunity to significantly reduce effective rates of
protection and harmonize protection across different sectors of the economy.
36.
The Motor Industry Development Program (MIDP) has led to gains in
employment and a significant increase in automobile exports (Box 4). The authorities
stated that the success of the program also provided a catalyst for new investment more
generally in South Africa. It has been extended through 2012. The mission noted, however,
that the financial structure of the MIDP was complicated and appeared to involve a
combination of export subsidies and heightened protection for domestic production. The cost
in terms of forgone fiscal revenue may be considerable. The mission suggested that an indepth, independent assessment be made of the costs and benefits of the MIDP and that the
conclusions of this assessment dictate the pace at which the program is phased down through
2012.

Box 4. The Motor Industry Development Program
The Motor Industry Development Program (MIDP) allows domestic producers of motor
vehicles to gain import duty credits when exporting finished motor vehicles or vehicle
components. The credits, which are transferable, are granted in proportion to the local content
of the exported vehicles or parts. Vehicle producers can also obtain the import duty credits by
investing in productive assets for export production. The MIDP was initiated in 1995 and is
scheduled to expire in 2012.
South Africa’s position in the world vehicle market is widely attributed to the MIDP. From
1995 to 2003, the number of vehicles exported grew more than tenfold, and South Africa’s
share of the world vehicle market reached 0.7 percent in 2003.
The MIDP differs from the duty drawback system common in many countries. In the case of
duty drawback systems, the duty paid on imported components can be claimed back if used for
exports, regardless of the domestic contents of the exported goods. A duty drawback system is
also available for South African vehicle exporters, but few have chosen to register under this
system. This suggests that the MIDP is the financially more attractive option.

21

SACU consists of South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, and Swaziland.

- 21 -

Parastatal reform and privatization
37.
Progress on major public enterprise reform projects has slowed since the sale of
a 28 percent stake in Telkom in 2003. Most notably, the restructuring of the electricity
sector has not proceeded as originally anticipated, and the government is reexamining its
plans to privatize generation and separate transmission and distribution.22 Privatization
proceeds were negligible in 2003/04, compared with budgeted receipts of 0.4 percent of
GDP. Projected proceeds have also been scaled back sharply.
38.
Inefficiencies in the operations of the major parastatals have added to cost and
price pressures, impeded technological progress, and undermined competitiveness. The
government indicated that it was determined to address these inefficiencies. It has responded
to concerns over the slowdown in privatization over the past year by stressing in public
statements that restructuring would go forward in conjunction with strengthened
microeconomic reforms and improved corporate governance.
39.
A review of the reform strategy for the major public enterprises is to be
completed by September 2004. The review will serve as the basis for efforts to strengthen
management and accountability and improve efficiency and service provision. The intention
is to promote greater investment by the public companies, primarily through concessions and
public-private partnerships. Public enterprise reforms are also intended to support improved
employment conditions, as well as black economic empowerment through preferential
procurement and joint ventures. The mission welcomed the emphasis on microeconomic
reforms, but urged the government to move expeditiously to improve parastatal operations
and resume the privatization effort. Job retraining or other social safety net policies should be
undertaken where needed. The mission also suggested that a clear and effective
communications strategy be an integral part of the restructuring process.
D. Social Issues
HIV/AIDS
40.
The HIV/AIDS epidemic is exacting an increasingly heavy toll on society.
According to recent estimates of Statistics South Africa, approximately 15 percent of adult
South Africans are estimated to be HIV positive,23 and prevalence rates continue to rise for
most age groups. AIDS claims 800-1,300 lives daily, and demographic projections suggest
22

In addition, delays occurred in the sale of a second national license for fixed-line phone
operations; the restructuring of units of the air-rail-port enterprise, Transnet; the sale of a
stake in the defense aerospace firm, Denel; and finalization of concession arrangements for
the Durban port container terminal.
23

According to previous UN/World Bank estimates, the HIV prevalence rate was around
25 percent.

- 22 -

that, in the absence of corrective measures, 9 million lives, equivalent to 20 percent of the
current population, may be lost over the next decade. Estimates suggest that the disease could
reduce output growth by between 0.5 and 2.5 percentage points per year.24 Direct public
spending on the disease has increased sharply in recent years, doubling in 2003/04 to
0.2 percent of GDP. Total spending is much higher, since one-fourth of public health
spending (0.8 percent of GDP) is HIV/AIDS related. Nutrition and income support programs,
which absorb around 0.6 percent of GDP, are also part of the broad response to the disease.
41.
With a drastic reduction of costs, a landmark decision was taken in August 2003
to provide ARVs to the public through the national health system.25 The provision of
ARVs offers the prospect of mitigating the worst impacts of HIV/AIDS. The treatment
regime is complicated, however, and South Africa’s program will be unprecedented in scope
internationally. Four hundred thousand patients require ARVs, including tens of thousands in
remote areas. By 2009, 1.5 million will need the drugs. The program will require a major
upgrade of personnel, facilities, and management.26 The fiscal costs start at 0.1 percent of
GDP in 2004/05 and increase to 0.3 percent of GDP per year beginning in 2007/08. The
ARV rollout has been running behind schedule so far, as staff training and deployment, drug
procurement, and site preparation have taken longer than expected. The rollout is expected to
help focus the response of the business community to the disease and stimulate greater
testing, possibly leading to higher reported prevalence rates.
Black economic empowerment (BEE) and land reform
42.
There is a broad appreciation within South Africa that initiatives to reduce
income and wealth disparities will contribute to greater social cohesion. The voluntary
nature of the government’s BEE strategy and land reform programs are important features
that should help sustain the support of all groups in the country.
43.
The BEE strategy involves agreement with business on a series of sectoral
charters that seek to encourage the transfer of assets and the promotion of black
participation in management and operations. The government has indicated that it would
like to see BEE charters completed for all major economic sectors by the end of the year,
following the launch of charters in the mining and financial sectors.27 In expressing support
24

A selected issues paper analyzes the impact of HIV/AIDS in greater depth.

25

Some 7 million South Africans are to receive ARVs through private insurance schemes,
rather than the public health system.
26

South Africa has experienced a steady loss of medical staff, particularly from rural areas,
and the 2004 budget provides for additional skill and rural allowances. Over half of ARV
program expenditures will go initially to health management, staffing, and infrastructure.
27

The mining and financial sector charters call for the transfer of 26 percent and 25 percent,
respectively, of ownership.

- 23 -

for the overall strategy, the mission identified several key issues that still needed to be
addressed. The capacity of the financial sector to lend is limited, and, while a variety of
innovative financing options had been discussed, uncertainties remained over how the
transfer of assets would be funded. The government had set aside the equivalent of 1 percent
of GDP over the next four years to support BEE transactions, but this funding represented
only a small proportion of the total value of asset sales envisaged. The authorities and the
mission agreed that it would be desirable to avoid financing empowerment deals through tax
breaks. The mission also reiterated its concern that there appeared to be few safeguards in the
empowerment strategy to prevent the concentration of transferred assets in a few hands.
44.
Land reform is a potentially important vehicle for maintaining social stability
and reducing rural unemployment and poverty. South Africa’s land reform program is
based on a willing buyer-seller principle, with expropriation provided for only in limited
circumstances and subject to appeal procedures. A target has been established for 30 percent
of agricultural land to be transferred to black ownership by 2015. After a very slow start, the
pace of land redistribution has picked up somewhat over the past year with improvements in
procedures and additional funding. To date, around 3 percent of land has been redistributed
or restituted. For the program to gain further momentum, issues relating to administrative
capacity constraints and restrictions on the subdivision of land will have to be addressed. The
government will also need to ensure that the availability of fiscal resources does not constrain
the pace of land transfers.28
45.
South Africa’s progress in achieving the Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs) has been somewhat uneven. In a number of areas, such as poverty reduction,
literacy, and the provision of basic amenities, large strides have been made. Other social
indicators, however, such as child mortality and life expectancy, have been affected by the
HIV/AIDS epidemic. At the current rate of progress, it is unlikely that most of the MDGs
will be achieved. Monitoring has been hampered by data availability, but the authorities are
undertaking additional efforts to improve the coverage and reliability of the statistical base.
III. DATA ISSUES
46.
Economic data for South Africa are generally of high quality. They are provided
to the Fund (and the public) with detail, frequency, and timeliness fully adequate for
surveillance purposes. South Africa subscribes to the SDDS and publishes all the data on the
reserve template. Staff encouraged the authorities to continue implementing the
recommendations of the 2002 data ROSC (notably those on government finance statistics), as
well as those of a more recent mission on monetary and financial statistics. Weaknesses
remain with regard to employment and other labor market data, and there have been delays in
28

The land redistribution program involves the provision of grants to subsidize land
purchases. The 2004/05 budget provides the equivalent of 0.1 percent of GDP for this
purpose over the next three years.

- 24 -

the publication of selected key economic indicators. In addition, large, unidentified
transactions in the balance of payments have been recorded on occasion. For example, during
the second half of 2003, these transactions, which are potentially volatile, amounted to the
equivalent of 4 percent of GDP. Efforts are under way to improve data collection in order to
reduce the large errors and omissions position.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
47.
The end of apartheid in 1994 represented a dramatic change in the political
landscape and gave rise to strong pressures on the government to use the budget
primarily as a tool for income redistribution. These pressures were wisely resisted, and
South Africa has been able to make impressive macroeconomic gains. Since 1994, the
average rate of growth has more than doubled to around 3 percent; public finances have been
strengthened significantly; inflation has been brought firmly under control; and sovereign
risk spreads and long-term interest rates have fallen to historically low levels. Great strides
have been made in reducing external vulnerability. A number of social indicators have
improved, but the HIV/AIDS epidemic has lowered life expectancy.
48.
Following a slowdown in economic activity in 2003, a rebound now appears to be
under way. The staff expects real GDP to grow by about 2½ percent in 2004 and by more
than 3 percent in 2005 in response to a mildly expansionary fiscal stance, low interest rates,
and a recovery in the global economy. The high pace of pay settlements, however, poses
downside risks that could undermine the recovery and complicate the effort to keep inflation
down, while a further currency appreciation or higher oil prices would also have a
dampening effect on the recovery.
49.
Growth performance, nonetheless, remains insufficient to make a significant
dent in unemployment and poverty reduction. This highlights the importance of South
Africa’s pushing ahead with structural reforms that can elevate growth to a higher plateau by
raising productivity and enhancing international competitiveness. It also underscores the role
that the budget should play in addressing South Africa’s acute and pressing social problems,
while helping maintain a sound and stable financial environment.
50.
The SARB deserves considerable credit for bringing inflation well within its
target range of 3-6 percent and rebuilding its international reserve position. Looking
ahead, the following observations and suggestions may prove helpful to the authorities:
x

Several indicators point to a mild buildup in inflationary pressures, and some increase
in interest rates may be required if inflation is to stay comfortably within target.
However, any adjustment in rates should lag, rather than lead, interest rate changes
overseas.

x

Once credibility in the inflation-targeting regime becomes firmly established, a
downward adjustment in the target band might be warranted since, under such
conditions, inflation could probably be lowered with minimal short-term output costs.

- 25 -

x

The SARB has allowed the exchange rate to respond to market forces, intervening
only to bolster its reserves and not to influence the value of the currency. The staff
continues to support this strategy. The rand has strengthened in value over the past
year, largely because of increases in commodity prices and stronger sentiment
generally in emerging market investments; in the staff’s view, the exchange rate
remains broadly in line with the long-run real equilibrium level suggested by
macroeconomic fundamentals.

x

The staff encourages the SARB to continue the process of reserve accumulation at a
pace dictated by prevailing balance of payments conditions. Larger reserve holdings
should help reduce currency volatility, while the sterilization costs involved would be
partly offset by a reduction in spreads and long-term interest rates.

x

The staff continues to support the gradual relaxation of capital controls; the present
strength of the rand provides a good opportunity to undertake a further round of
deregulation.

51.
The government has helped restore confidence in economic management
through sustained fiscal discipline and the adoption of important institutional
innovations. The return to this effort has been a healthier external position, and lower
interest rates and indebtedness that have freed resources for more productive purposes. The
present relaxation in the fiscal stance is appropriate in light of the slowdown in economic
activity in 2003 and the need to address social issues. The staff would, nonetheless, caution
that deficits significantly above 3 percent of GDP could reverse the stabilization gains that
have been achieved, weaken international competitiveness, and lead to an undesirable
accumulation of debt. Deficit containment would also alleviate the pressure on monetary
policy during the recovery in economic activity. In the event that spending pressures need to
be accommodated, funding should rely on tax measures or cuts in low priority spending,
rather that borrowing.
52.
The government considers unemployment reduction a central economic and
social priority. To address the problem, it has adopted a multifaceted strategy that includes
skills development, improvements in education standards, a public works program, and
amendments to labor legislation. Each of these initiatives represents an important step in the
right direction. The staff, nevertheless, believes that there is scope for further progress. In
particular, small and medium-sized businesses that are legally subject to centralized
collective bargaining agreements should be allowed greater latitude in setting wages.
Increases in statutory minimum wages for those sectors not covered by bargaining
agreements should be tempered by the need to promote job creation, especially in rural areas,
where the incidence of unemployment is particularly high. The Skills Development Program
should place greater emphasis on training the unemployed, and it should not rely on a labor
levy as a source of funding. Finally, relatively high dismissal costs have discouraged labor
recruitment, and steps need to be taken to significantly streamline costly arbitration and
reconciliation procedures.

- 26 -

53.
A review of the tariff regime is close to completion. This review will provide an
excellent occasion to move ahead forcefully with lowering and harmonizing effective rates of
protection and simplifying the tariff regime. It is important, however, that trade liberalization
be accompanied by labor market reform, so that the potential benefits of productivity for job
creation can be realized in full.
54.
The government is reviewing its strategy for parastatal reform. The mission
would urge that renewed emphasis be placed on privatization as a means of raising industrial
efficiency and stimulating technical innovation. In light of the restructuring that has already
taken place, any adverse impact on employment is likely to be limited and could be
cushioned by an expansion of social safety net programs, such as job retraining. It would be
helpful if a transparent mechanism were in place to monitor the risk sharing between the
government and the private sector to ensure the success of the public-private partnership
programs.
55.
The HIV/AIDS epidemic is having a devastating social impact with costly
macroeconomic repercussions. Quite appropriately, the government decided last year to
ramp up its efforts to address the problem. It has put in place a comprehensive plan for the
universal rollout of ARV drugs, and parallel steps have been taken to strengthen the public
health system and increase child support grants.
56.
South Africa has embarked on important initiatives that seek to reduce income
and wealth disparities. These initiatives, which cover black economic empowerment and
land reform, will be vital in helping strengthen the country’s social fabric and sustain the
process of macroeconomic stabilization and structural change. Funding issues relating to
BEE, however, still need to be resolved, and the staff would also reiterate its concern over
the apparent absence of safeguards against an undue concentration of assets. It is important
that good progress be made in meeting the targets for land distribution, which are ambitious,
in order to avoid the risk of unfulfilled expectations. The pace of land redistribution has at
last picked up, but certain constraints, such as restrictions on the subdivision of land, remain
to be addressed.
57.
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation will be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

Sources: South African Reserve Bank (SARB); and Fund staff estimates.

1/ Part of the increase in private sector credit in 2003 is due to a change in accounting rules for derivatives. According to Accounting
Statement AC133, implemented in January 2003, derivative positions must be marked to market and reported on a gross rather than net basis.
2/ Banks are audited using generally accepted international standards; capital adequacy requirements are also imposed
on securities trading.
3/ Including foreign financing in banks' own name on-lent to clients.
4/ Including foreign currency deposits and other foreign loans and advances.
5/ Short-term deposits include check and demand deposits.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:

The South African rand floats against other currencies. South Africa formally accepted the
obligations of Article VIII, Section 2, 3, and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement, as from
September 15, 1973. On July 15, 2004 the exchange rate of the rand was US$0.1637=R1.
South Africa has followed a strategy of progressively easing exchange controls on capital
transactions since 1994, reflecting the government’s commitment to the eventual abolition
of these controls, and has made considerable progress in this regard in recent years. With
the abolition of the financial rand in 1995, all exchange controls on nonresidents were
eliminated. They are free to purchase shares, bonds, and other assets without restriction and
to repatriate dividends, interest receipts, and current and capital profits, as well as the original
investment capital. Nonresidents are also free to hold rand accounts in the banking system,
but they are constrained on the amount they may borrow domestically. This constraint has
also been relaxed, and only organizations with more than 75 percent nonresident ownership
are subject to limits on their domestic borrowing. In February 2004, this limit was
300 percent of shareholders’ investment (increased from 100 percent earlier).
Since 1995, exchange controls on capital transaction by residents have also been relaxed.
Rather than allowing complete liberalization of a particular type of current or capital
transaction, the authorities have pursued a strategy of allowing an increasing array of

- 42 -

APPENDIX I

transactions, with each subject to a quantitative cap that has been progressively raised
over time. Most of the restrictions are on capital outflows:
On portfolio investment. Institutional investors are permitted to invest in foreign securities,
subject to an overall limit of 15 (20) percent of their total assets for insurance companies
and pension funds (unit trusts). Corporates may, upon application, be permitted to
establish primary listings offshore under certain conditions. Private individuals are
allowed to invest up to R750,000 offshore.
On the financing of direct investment. The allowance governing South African corporates’
use of South African funds to finance approved foreign direct investment has been
increased considerably during 2002 and 2003 and stands at R2 billion per project for
investment in Africa and R1 billion per project outside Africa. In addition, South African
companies are permitted to finance 10 percent of the excess cost of approved foreign
direct investment from South African funds (being the difference between the total cost
of the project and the R2 billion/ R1 billion foreign direct investment allowance).
In addition to the above, there are restrictions on, inter alia, the travel allowances (R140,000
for private individuals), the transfer of funds abroad by emigrants (“blocked funds), and the
investment of currency proceeds from exports (which must be repatriated within 180 days
from accrual). The transfer of blocked funds in excess of R750,000 for individuals and
R1.5 million for families is allowed, provided a 10 percent tax is paid and that the amount is
below R 5 million. Dividends and interest payments on the blocked funds are freely
transferable abroad and travel allowances can be augmented if bona fide need is documented.

Article IV Consultations

The 2003 Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on
August 20, 2003 (Country Report No. 04/178). South Africa is on the standard 12-month
Article IV consultation cycle.

Technical Assistance

A FAD mission took place during the period June 2–6, 2003 to discuss with the National
Treasury their draft royalty bill (published in March 2003). A monetary and financial
statistics mission took place during the period November 4–19, 2003. This mission
(i) reviewed the SARB collection and compilation procedures of monetary statistics,
(ii) assisted the staff of the SARB in developing a work program to facilitate the full
implementation of the methodology recommended in the Monetary and Financial Statistics
Manual (MFSM) (iii) introduced the standardized report forms for reporting central bank data
to STA, and (iv) initiated the development of an integrated database for monetary statistics
that will meet the Fund’s publication requirements. A follow-up technical assistance mission
to introduce the standardized report forms for reporting the remaining monetary data to STA
and to finalize the integrated database took place during the period May 26–June 9, 2004.

APPENDIX II

South Africa: Relations with the World Bank Group
Between 1951 and 1966, the Bank made 11 loans to South Africa, totaling US$241.8 million,
largely for expanding the country’s rail and harbor systems, and for generating and
transmitting electricity. The Bank ceased lending operations to South Africa in 1966 and the
loans from that earlier period have been fully repaid.
Between 1990 and 1994, the Bank resumed activities in South Africa through a
comprehensive program of economic policy advice and capacity building. There was open
participation between the Bank and relevant sectors of the South African society, such as
government, the Reserve Bank, (then) opposition parties, universities, labor unions,
industrialists, and nongovernmental organizations. Several discussion papers and reports
resulted on all the key sectors: the macroeconomy, education, health, agriculture, fiscal
decentralization, labor markets, trade policy, and microfinance.
Since 1994, the emphasis has shifted slightly toward the provision of policy advice to
government, particularly in the areas of municipal services, welfare financing,
macroeconomic strategy, poverty, medium-term expenditure framework, economic impact of
HIV/AIDS, and business environment. The Bank’s non-lending involvement has ranged from
traditional economic and sector work, focusing on sectoral analysis and policy
recommendations, to more formal research outputs, including numerous policy support
exercises that provided the government with advice on strategic policy options.
In addition, the Bank Group has provided financial and technical support through a number
of different channels. The Bank resumed project lending through the Industrial
Competitiveness and Job Creation Project in 1997 (initially for an amount US$46 million,
but subsequently the amount has been reduced to US$24.5 million at the government’s
request and US$18.0 million has so far been disbursed). A Technical Assistance Loan for the
Municipal Financial Management Technical Assistance Project (MFMTAP) was approved in
2002 for an amount of US$15 million. US$0.15 million was disbursed on initiation and a
further R9.6 million was disbursed in June 2004. A number of GEF grants were approved for
nature conservation and development projects such as the C.A.P.E. Biodiversity Conservation
and Sustainable Development Project (GEF grant of US$9 million in 2004); the Cape Peninsula
Biodiversity Conservation Project (GEF grant of US$12.3 million in 1998); the MalotiDrakensberg Transfrontier Conservation and Development Project for US$7.9 million, the
Greater Addo Elephant National Park Project for US$5.5 million and four medium-size
projects of US$3 million.
The International Finance Corporation (IFC) has been operating in South Africa for only the
last four to five years. However the committed portfolio has grown steadily to
US$162.6 million bringing its country portfolio to the second largest position in Africa after
Nigeria by converting Johannesburg office into its Africa headquarters. The IFC has invested
in Bioventures Fund (US$1.9m), a first for the market, targeting biotechnology firms, an
emerging sectoral focus in South Africa. The IFC's continued support for South Africa Home
Loans, with an investment holding of US$3.6 million (19.5%), pioneered the securitization of

- 44 -

APPENDIX II

mortgages in 2002, which has led to more efficient and less expensive housing finance
products. In FY02, IFC has provided QE - Loan type financing to Mvelaphanda Gold
amounting to US$28 million and committed US$ 6.1 million in various Finance and
Insurance sector companies. The IFC strategy for South Africa will support the government's
objectives in terms of black economic empowerment, the development of the SME sector, as
well as developing the financial markets. Another strong element of the strategy will be to
support South African companies expanding into Africa.
Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA): South Africa has been a member of
MIGA since 1994. Recently, in March 2002, it established a regional office in Johannesburg.
South African investors are the most active users of MIGA guarantees among Category Two
countries, and currently have US$212.5 million of gross MIGA coverage (and
US$161.1 million of net coverage) outstanding across 10 contracts of guarantee. Since
inception, MIGA has issued 12 contracts, worth US$298.3 million of gross coverage, to
South African investors for investments in Lesotho, Mozambique, Nigeria, Swaziland and
Zambia. South African investors now account for US$212.5 million of MIGA’s gross
exposure as a result of strong relationships with South African banks, development agencies
and the Export Credit Insurance Corporation of South Africa. In December 2003, MIGA
issued a US$11.4 million guarantee to IP Direct of South Africa for its investment in IP
Satellite Services of Nigeria. This support for an SME, south-south investment will allow the
project to establish an Internet service provider facility in Nigeria, via a satellite platform.
Target markets are individuals, home offices, and SMEs, which currently suffer from a lack
of high-speed connectivity. The project is important for pan-African economic integration
and is consistent with the NEPAD initiative.

APPENDIX III

South Africa: Statistical Issues
Real sector
In June 1999, Statistics South Africa released a major revision of the national income
accounts based on the United Nations’ System of National Accounts (1993). The revision
raised nominal GDP by some 13 percent for the 1993-98 period and raised the average
annual rate of growth of real GDP from 2.2 percent to 2.7 percent for the period 1994-98.
Reporting of real sector data for International Financial Statistics (IFS) is timely.
Data reported for Direction of Trade Statistics (DOTS), however, show substantial
inconsistencies with external trade data reported for IFS, particularly exports.
Labor market statistics are published with lags of about six months, and unemployment
data are available only at a six month frequency. Given the seriousness of the
unemployment problem, labor market analysis and policy design need to be based
on better, more frequent, and timely labor market data.
Beginning with the April 2003 index, Statistics South Africa issued revisions to the
Consumer Price Index for the period January 2002 to March 2003, reflecting the
incorporation of more reliable data on residential rents.
Government finance
South Africa currently reports data for the consolidated central government and for
regional and local governments for publication in the Government Finance Statistics
Yearbook. It also reports monthly data covering the operations of the budgetary central
government for publication in IFS. GFS data, although still on a cash basis, are compiled
and disseminated domestically and internationally according to the GFSM 2001
framework.
Monetary statistics
South Africa regularly reports monetary statistics for publication in IFS, although there is
room for improving the timeliness of the data on nonbank financial institutions. The
SARB is working on the implementation of the recommendations of the 2003 and 2004
monetary and financial statistics missions towards full implementation of the
methodology recommended in the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual.
Balance of payments
South Africa is a regular reporter of balance of payments data. It has recently revised its
balance of payments data to be consistent with the fifth edition of the Balance of
Payments Manual. However, there are deficiencies in the coverage of trade with Southern
African Customs Union (SACU) countries, and in the coverage of some service

- 46 -

APPENDIX III

transactions, mainly travel and construction service components. Only partial data are
compiled on communications services, and the coverage of reinvested earnings on direct
investment is limited to foreign branches of domestic banks. The presentation of foreign
reserve accumulation in the balance of payment includes both the central bank’s reserves
as well as the commercial banks’ foreign reserves resulting from exchange control
regulations. Net errors and omissions in the balance of payments vary by a large amount
from quarter to quarter. Work is ongoing to reduce the large errors and omissions, which
in the second half of 2003 reached 4 percent of GDP.
Although South Africa disseminates its international reserve position in line with the
requirements of the IMF’s template on international reserves and foreign currency
liquidity, the reporting of its international reserve position could be brought closer to best
practices in a number of ways, including the application of a consistent formula for the
valuation of gold, and the exclusion of regional currency holdings from reserves.

APPENDIX IV

Medium-Term Outlook and Debt Sustainability
Baseline scenario
The staff’s baseline medium-term scenario is based on a projection for annual real GDP
growth of about 3 percent during 2004–09.29 The scenario assumes the continuation of
current policies, including sound fiscal policy, the achievement of the inflation target, and
steady, but very modest, progress with structural reforms. It also incorporates a recovery in
the world economic environment in line with the WEO (Table 1).
More specifically, the baseline scenario assumes the following:
annual world real GDP growth of some 4½ in the near future, consistent with the
assumptions in the April 2004 World Economic Outlook;
implementation and extension of the authorities’ medium-term budget framework (MTBF),
in which the national budget deficit averages about 3 percent of GDP;
achievement of the inflation target;
a strengthening of the net reserve position;
continued trade liberalization under the commitments to the World Trade Organization
(WTO) and in the free trade agreements with the European Union and the Southern
African Development Community, including further simplification and reduction of
tariff rates;
continued restructuring of public enterprises to realize efficiency gains and benefits from the
transfer of technology; and
gradual progress in removing rigidities in the labor market along with training efforts to
improve job skills, in particular among the unemployed.
Under these assumptions, achieving a trend decline in unemployment may be difficult as
firms may continue to rely on labor-saving technologies as long as skill levels remain low
and rigidities persist in the labor market. The national government’s medium-term fiscal
29

The impact of HIV/AIDS on medium-term economic growth is highly uncertain. Estimates
of the impact on the decline in annual output growth range from ½ to 2½ percentage points.
In the baseline scenario, the HIV/AIDS pandemic is one among several factors that limit
potential output growth to 3 percent over the medium term. Public expenditures on
antiretroviral HIV/AIDS drugs are assumed to increase from 0.1 percent of GDP in 2004/05
to an annual level of 0.3 percent of GDP from 2007/08. See the Selected Issues Paper on
HIV/AIDS in South Africa for details.

- 49 -

APPENDIX IV

program will lead to a small increase in the ratio of debt to GDP, as it incorporates a rise in
social expenditures from 2004/05 of approximately 0.7 percent of GDP, due to increased
spending on HIV/AIDS, black economic empowerment, and land reform. A fiscal adjustment
of some 0.2–0.3 percentage points would be required to stabilize the debt to GDP ratio at its
current level.
The acceleration of GDP growth is expected to contribute to growth in import demand and
will lead to a somewhat higher current account deficit. Gross reserves are assumed to
increase to the equivalent of some three and a half months of imports over the medium term.
The risks to the medium term outlook are broadly balanced. They mainly originate from
a more rapid implementation of economic reform policies on the upside and a
discontinuation or slowdown in implementing economic reform policies on the downside.
The South African economy has proved relatively resilient to external shocks, such as slower
global economic activity and higher oil prices.30 Sustainability analyses for public and
external debt (see below) provide further support for South Africa’s resilience to external
shocks.
Accelerated reforms
Growth effects resulting from the timely implementation of comprehensive reform efforts in
the areas of labor markets, trade liberalization, and the public enterprises and continued
sound fiscal and monetary policies could increase annual real GDP growth to about 5 percent
over the medium term (Table 2).
Overall, the accelerated reform scenario assumes higher growth contributions from all three
endogenous growth components, employment, capital, and total factor productivity. This
scenario assumes that further labor market deregulation along the lines suggested in this
report is implemented without delay to help raise employment creation to some 3 percent per
year. Accelerated trade liberalization, public enterprise reform and speedy privatization are
essential to help boost factor productivity. To increase total factor productivity growth from
present rates of just over 1 percent to the levels of some East Asian countries (2-3 percent),
these structural reforms will need to be supplemented by an improvement in infrastructure,
enhancements in the effectiveness of all levels of government to deliver public services, and
additional efforts in the area of crime reduction. Accelerated reforms should improve the
investment climate in South Africa and stimulate FDI inflows.
Increased productivity, a flexible labor market, and a credible inflation targeting regime
would slow down the rise in nominal unit labor costs over the medium. This should result in
30

This resilience has been the result of sound macroeconomic policies, a flexible exchange
rate, and a relatively low dependence on oil imports combined with higher world market
prices for gold and platinum, which account for about 30 percent of South Africa’s goods
exports.

- 50 -

APPENDIX IV

lower unemployment. Investment as a share of GDP would rise earlier and more strongly
than under the baseline medium-term scenario and would reach 18.6 percent by 2009. Higher
GDP growth and higher export-oriented investment through a pick-up in FDI inflows would
increase over time import and export growth and would unleash TFP growth. As it may take
time before the increased export competitiveness leads to higher exports, the current account
deficit is initially expected to rise compared to the baseline scenario. The projected path of
inflation remains unchanged under the accelerated reform scenario, consistent with the
successful implementation of inflation targeting.
Accelerated GDP growth would likely contribute to enhanced fiscal revenues, particularly to
the corporate and personal income taxes. The authorities have long maintained a policy
objective of keeping the revenue-to-GDP ratio at around 25 percent to promote
competitiveness and spending efficiency. However, increased revenues in the accelerated
reform scenario, possibly amounting to around ½ percent of GDP, could be used to improve
the primary balance and maintain debt levels at their present levels.
The above analysis suggests that, to decrease unemployment by half within the next 10 years,
real GDP growth will have to be substantially higher, on the order of some 5 percent per
year. Certainly, increased investment is necessary for generating new jobs and increasing
growth. At the same time, investor concerns over business costs, such as those relating to
HIV/AIDS and the incidence of crime, need to be addressed. However, additional efforts
need to be taken promptly to lower labor costs. Total factor productivity needs to be raised
through accelerated trade liberalization and public enterprise reform.

Debt sustainability: Medium-term scenarios
South Africa’s public debt position appears sustainable. The government’s success in
consolidating the fiscal position contributed to a reduction of the ratio of medium- and longterm public debt to GDP from 47 percent in 1999 to 38 percent in early 2004.31 External
medium- and long-term debt has increased moderately in recent years, from less than
2 percent of GDP in 1997 to around 6 percent of GDP at present, reflecting increased
international borrowing and the real depreciation of the rand. Under the policies outlined in
the 2004 budget and the medium-term expenditure framework, South Africa’s debt should
remain moderate and sustainable over the coming decade, albeit with some slight increase in
the public debt-to-GDP ratio from 37 percent of GDP at end-2003 to 40 percent in 2009
(Table 3). Gross financing needs amount to just over 5 percent of GDP per year over the
medium-term, slightly below the average of the past five years (Table 4).

31

Contingent liabilities amount to approximately 11 percent of GDP, including government
guarantees and actuarial liabilities for pension and insurance funds.

- 53 -

APPENDIX IV

Public debt dynamics appear to be manageable under a variety of short-term shocks,
including lower GDP growth, a temporary weakening of the primary balance, a 30 percent
real depreciation of the exchange rate, and a ten percent increase of the debt stock. Although
under each of these shocks, the public debt ratio increases over the projection period, it
remains at or below 50 percent of GDP. Gross financing needs increase by as much as 2
percentage points of GDP per year in scenarios involving lower GDP growth.
With regard to external debt, the baseline projection implies a stabilization of the external
debt-to-GDP ratio at slightly above 20 percent. This reflects a moderate increase in the
current account deficit to about 1.8 percent of GDP—of which half is covered by net direct
investment and equity flows. The overall stable current account outlook masks an expected
recomposition of exports as gold exports are gradually replaced by other metals and services
(tourism). On the investment income side, higher earnings on non-resident investments in
South Africa should be more than compensated by a gradual reduction in debt service costs
as the emerging market risk premium narrows. Overall, the current account deficit is
expected to increase by a small amount, as the increase in the investment ratio is not fully
compensated by increased private saving. Public sector saving is expected to remain roughly
unchanged.
The main risk to this relatively benign outlook stems from a larger than expected negative
impact of the AIDS pandemic on productivity growth. While the expiration in 2005 of
preferential textile and clothing quotas will negatively affect South Africa’s export of textiles
and/or increase its imports, the overall economic impact is likely to be relatively small, as
textiles and clothing exports corresponds to only about 1 percent of merchandise exports.
Similarly, the impact of increased oil prices would be relatively limited. A $5 per barrel
increase in the oil import price is likely to result in an increase of, at most, 0.2 percent of
GDP in the annual current account deficit, assuming unchanged oil consumption.
The sustainability of South Africa’s external position is relatively robust to reasonable
shocks. Of the bound tests presented in Table 5, the largest increase in the external debt-toGDP ratio would occur if the GDP deflator as measured in U.S. dollars decreased over two
years by 2 standard deviations below its historical average. Given the historically high
volatility of the real exchange rate (and the dollar-based GDP deflator), this would imply a
real deprecation of the exchange rate of close to 70 percent. Even in this case, however, the
external debt-to-GDP ratio would not increase beyond 40 percent of GDP. Moreover, the
impact of a given real deprecation of the exchange rate would result in a smaller impact than
in most countries as only 75 percent of the external debt is denominated in foreign
currencies.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
September 3, 2004
This statement provides information that has become available since the staff report was
issued. The thrust of the staff appraisal remains unchanged.
1.
Latest activity indicators support the view that the broad based economic
recovery is gaining strength. South Africa’s economic growth rose to an annualized rate of
3.9 percent in the second quarter, underpinned by strong performance in all sectors. First
quarter growth has also been revised upwards from 3.1 percent to 3.6 percent, which
suggests that the staff’s growth projection of 2.6 percent for 2004 may be exceeded slightly.
2.
As indicated in the staff report, the South African Reserve Bank lowered its repo
rate by 50 basis points to 7.5 percent in mid-August. The reason explained for the rate cut
was an improved inflation outlook, but it had not been anticipated in the market. Since the
rate cut, the rand has depreciated by nearly 10 percent against the U.S. dollar.
3.
Mild price pressures remain in the pipeline. Although inflation fell further slightly
to 4.2 percent in July, the staff remains of the view that some increase in interest rates would
be advisable over the next 12 months if inflation is to stay comfortably in the target range
of 3–6 percent. Inflationary pressures are likely to develop since domestic demand growth
has been very strong, the pace of monetary expansion remains relatively high, and ongoing
wage settlements have been well in excess of inflation and productivity gains.
4.
Fiscal data through end-July indicate that the budget is on track. While total
revenues are in line with budget estimates, revenues from the VAT and the personal income
tax have been running well above projections. On the other hand, corporate income tax
proceeds are well below target. Public sector wage negotiations, which are usually completed
in July, are continuing.
5.
According to preliminary estimates, the deficit on the external current account
widened to 2.7 percent of GDP in the first half of 2004, from 1.2 percent in the second
half of 2003. This deterioration largely reflects the impact of buoyant domestic demand
conditions and the strength of the rand on import volumes. It also includes the purchase of
aircraft.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
December 2, 2004

Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Concludes Article IV Consultation with South Africa
On September, 3, 2004 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with South Africa.1
Background
Growth slowed in 2003 to 1.9 percent, from 3.6 percent in 2002, despite strong domestic
demand. Fuelled by low interest rates, a more expansionary fiscal stance, and the wealth
effects from strong commodity and property price increases, domestic expenditures rose
strongly in 2003. But the increase in aggregate demand did not translate into higher growth,
largely because of a strong currency appreciation, weak overseas demand, and poor weatherrelated performance in agriculture.
Developments so far in 2004, point to a rebound in growth. Real GDP grew by 3.9 percent in
the second quarter (quarter-on-quarter, annualized) and a range of indicators, such as retail
sales and consumer and business confidence measures, point to an acceleration in activity.
The strength of the rand has contributed to a marked dissipation of inflationary pressures and
has also enabled the South African Reserve Bank to reconstitute its net international reserve
position. Inflation fell from a peak of over 10 percent in October 2002 to 4.4 percent in May
2004, which is well within the SARB target range of 3-6 percent.2 The SARB has been

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

These are CPIX inflation rates. CPIX is the CPI less interest payments on mortgage bonds and is
the measure targeted by the SARB under its inflation-targeting framework.

-2purchasing modest amounts of foreign exchange in the market and in February 2004 closed its
open position in the forward market; in the past, this exposure had been a major source of
external vulnerability and macroeconomic instability. The increase in net international reserves,
together with sound financial policies more generally, has contributed to a substantial decline in
sovereign risk spreads.
Prudent fiscal policy has been the cornerstone of South Africa’s stabilization effort in the first ten
years after apartheid. To help address South Africa’s pressing social problems and provide a
mild countercyclical boost to the economy, fiscal policy was eased somewhat in 2003/04. The
budget deficit increased to 2.4 percent of GDP from 1.1 percent in 2002/03, reflecting an
increase in social spending of 1.3 percent of GDP. The budget for 2004/05 provides for a further
relaxation of the fiscal stance. The envisaged moderate expansion in the fiscal stance seems
appropriate to help address South Africa's pressing social problems. However, a deficit in the
region of 3 percent should be considered the upper limit of what is desirable to maintain
macroeconomic stability and keep indebtedness low.
While the stabilization effort is now largely complete, South Africa faces formidable challenges
in the form of high unemployment and widespread poverty. The official rate of unemployment
fell to 28.2 percent in September 2003 from 31.2 percent in March 2003, but this mainly
reflected a sharp drop in the number of people looking for work. The government is
implementing a multi-faceted strategy to increase employment that includes skills development,
improvements in education standards, a public works program, and amendments to labor
legislation. These elements represent important steps in the right direction. Ongoing reviews of
the tariff regime and the strategy for parastatal restructuring also provide an excellent
opportunity to move ahead forcefully with reforms that enhance industrial efficiency and
competitiveness. Black economic empowerment and land reform will be vital in helping to
reduce social disparities. The HIV/AIDS epidemic is having a devastating social impact with
costly macroeconomic repercussions. The government has put in place a comprehensive plan
for the universal roll-out of ARV drugs and parallel steps are being taken to strengthen the
public health system and provide social safety nets in the form of child support grants.
Executive Board Assessment
They commended the South African authorities for the success in stabilizing the economy
through skillful macroeconomic management, and for the considerable progress in structural
reforms. Inflation has been brought under control, public finances have been strengthened, and
the international reserve position has improved. Directors considered that these achievements
have laid the strong foundation for higher sustained growth, greater competition, increased
efficiency, and reduced external vulnerability.
Directors agreed that the economy appears poised for a recovery in activity, supported by
monetary easing over the past year, a moderately expansionary fiscal policy, and a pick up in
overseas demand. They noted, however, that the main risks to the outlook relate to a
continuation of the high pace of wage settlements, higher oil prices, and renewed currency
appreciation, which could put a break on the recovery. Directors emphasized that the policy

-3challenge facing South Africa is to achieve, over the longer run, higher sustainable economic
growth and substantive reductions in unemployment, poverty, and the prevalence of HIV/AIDS.
The authorities’ approach to tackling HIV/AIDS is exemplary, but a more concerted effort will be
needed in this regard to improve the public health system and mitigate the social and economic
effects of HIV/AIDS. Directors stressed the importance of removing structural impediments to
growth, particularly in the areas of the labor market, trade, and public enterprises. The
government also needs to implement initiatives aimed at reducing income and wealth
disparities, which will help maintain social cohesion.
Directors noted that prudent fiscal policy, in conjunction with budgetary reforms, has been the
cornerstone of the stabilization effort. They supported the budget for 2004/05, which provides
for a modest expansion of the fiscal stance, in light of the slowdown in economic activity in 2003
and social and infrastructure needs. Directors cautioned, however, that fiscal deficits should be
contained within levels that will not exert undue pressure on long-term interest rates and the
exchange rate, or lead to an undesirable accumulation of public debt. They considered that
additional resources, if needed to support social programs, should be raised through new tax
initiatives, cuts in non-priority spending, and strengthening of tax administration and expenditure
management. It was suggested also that more resources be made available for HIV/AIDS
prevention and treatment programs.
Directors commended the authorities for the progress made in bringing inflation down to within
the central bank’s target range, which had enabled a significant reduction in short-term interest
rates. They noted, however, that several indicators—including continued high oil prices and
exchange rate developments—point to a mild buildup in inflationary pressures over the next
year. Directors therefore urged the authorities to remain vigilant and stand ready to raise
interest rates in a timely manner, but cautioned that any such adjustment should lag, rather than
lead, interest rate changes abroad. They also considered that enhancing the credibility of the
inflation-targeting framework will help anchor inflation expectations, and that bringing projected
inflation targets to a rate closer to the midpoint of the band would help in this regard.
Directors noted that the closure of the South African Reserve Bank (SARB)’s open position in
the forward market has helped remove a potential source of external vulnerability and
strengthen investor confidence. They agreed that the exchange rate remains broadly consistent
with macroeconomic fundamentals, and welcomed the authorities’ commitment to a free floating
exchange rate regime, with intervention limited to strengthening international reserves as
needed to cushion against currency volatility and speculation. Directors welcomed the
authorities’ prudent debt management strategy, and supported the approach to gradually
relaxing capital controls. The current strength of the rand presents an opportune time to ease
controls further.
Directors welcomed that South Africa’s financial and corporate sectors are healthy and appear
resilient to major exchange and interest rate shocks. While agreeing that the banks seem
reasonably well protected in the event of adverse developments in the real estate market,
Directors cautioned that vulnerability could potentially rise if a fall in property prices were to be
accompanied by increases in interest rates. They therefore encouraged the authorities to

-4monitor closely bank lending to the real estate sector, and welcomed the efforts underway to
address gaps in the regulatory framework and to strengthen bank supervision in line with the
Financial Sector Assessment Program recommendations. Directors praised the authorities for
including collective action clauses in their recent international bond issue. They also welcomed
the progress made in implementing the AML/CFT regime, and urged increased emphasis on
identifying beneficial owners of accounts. Directors looked forward to parliamentary passage of
legislation that criminalizes the financing of terrorism, terrorist acts, and terrorist organizations.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ strategy to address the acute unemployment problem, but
urged them to take more determined action in labor market reforms aimed at enhancing job
skills, removing barriers to job creation, and increasing labor mobility. In this context, they
agreed that the collective bargaining system should be made more decentralized to allow smalland medium-sized enterprises greater autonomy in setting wages. The government’s Skills
Development Program should be Directors stressed that improved by placing greater emphasis
on training the unemployed and reducing labor taxes.care should be exercised in implementing
the labor-intensive public works program to ensure its accountability, and that procedures for
dismissing and retrenching workers be streamlined.
Directors urged stronger efforts to raise productivity, enhance international competitiveness,
and promote private-sector-led growth, particularly through further trade liberalization,
privatization, and wage restraint. The completion of an import tariff review would provide a good
occasion to move ahead vigorously with lowering and harmonizing effective rates of protection
and simplifying the tariff regime. To realize the potential employment benefits, trade
liberalization should be accompanied by labor market reforms. Directors underscored the
importance of accelerating the privatization program to improve efficiency in the operations of
major parastatals, and looked forward to the completion of the review of the reform strategy for
these enterprises. They considered that the restructuring process should be supported by social
safety net programs and job training, together with a clear, effective communication strategy. In
addition, a transparent mechanism should be put in place to monitor the risk sharing between
the government and the private sector to ensure the success of the public-private partnership
programs. It would also be important that these programs are not used to bail out financially
troubled private firms. Imposing hard budget constraints and improving corporate governance
were also considered priorities.
Directors welcomed the black economic empowerment and land reform programs as key
components of the initiatives to reduce income and wealth disparities. Funding issues relating to
black empowerment, however, still need to be resolved and safeguards against an undue
concentration of assets strengthened. Directors emphasized that it would be essential to make
good progress in meeting the targets for land redistribution and in achieving the Millennium
Development Goals.
Directors encouraged the authorities to address remaining weaknesses in employment and
other labor market data. They welcomed the authorities’ ongoing efforts to identify the origins of
the large net errors and omissions in the balance of payments.

-5Directors commended the South African authorities for their leadership role in conflict resolution
and poverty reduction in Africa, particularly through contributions to the PRGF-HIPC Trust and
in the context of NEPAD and the African Union.
