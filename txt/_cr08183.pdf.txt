•

2004 Article IV Consultation. The last consultation was completed on July 30, 2004. Directors
commended the authorities for stabilizing the economy and the resumption of growth. They encouraged the
authorities to strengthen their structural reform efforts to reduce vulnerabilities.

•

2007 Article IV Consultation. This year’s discussions focused on policies that would help to address the
main problem faced by the economy over a long period, namely, endemic low growth, which has led to
declining living standards and widespread poverty. The staff (with participation of the World Bank and IDB
staffs) prepared selected issues papers on reform areas necessary to entrench macroeconomic stability,
reinvigorate growth, and reduce poverty.

•

Fund Relations. A 27-month Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) was approved on May 31, 2006 (for
SDR 65 million or 65 percent of quota). The first review was completed on a lapse of time basis on
September 29, 2006. The authorities are treating the arrangement as precautionary, and Paraguay has no
outstanding Fund credit. Paraguay maintains a floating exchange rate regime with occasional interventions
to achieve reserve targets and smooth out bulky and/or seasonal transactions. It has accepted the obligations
under Article VIII, Section 2 (a), 3, and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement. The exchange system is free
of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions.

•

Second and Third SBA Reviews. The two reviews are combined because it took longer than expected to
agree on financial policies for 2007. All performance criteria and all but three structural benchmarks were
observed through end-April 2007. The economy is estimated to have grown by 4 percent and headline
inflation rose to 12½ percent in 2006, overshooting the 7 percent program target mainly due to supply
shocks.

•

2007 Program. Macroeconomic objectives for 2007 are broadly similar to those presented at the time of
program approval in May 2006, including real GDP growth of 4–5 percent and a core inflation rate of
5 percent. Fiscal policy will aim at maintaining overall balance. The structural reform agenda addresses
issues identified during the consultation discussions, aiming at reducing impediments to growth and
alleviating poverty.

•

Discussions. These took place during November 29–December 13, 2006 and March 7–13, 2007 in
Asunción; and April 11–13, 2007 in Washington. The mission met with President Duarte-Frutos, VicePresident Castiglioni, Finance Minister Bergen, Central Bank President Rojas, former Central Bank
President Pérez dos Santos, the Social and Economic Cabinets, Deputy Finance Minister von Horoch, senior
officials, representatives of the international, business and banking communities, and members of Congress
and civil society. The staff included A. Santos (head), F. Frantischek, M. Mlachila, T. Roy, B. Monfort (all
WHD), P. Breuer (PDR), and J. Gasha (MCM). The mission was assisted by L. Duran-Downing, the Fund’s
senior resident representative. Mr. Singh (WHD) attended the policy discussions during December 4–5,
2006. Mr. Salgueiro (OED) also participated in the discussions.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Achievements and Performance
•

Macroeconomic outcomes continue to be strong. Since the approval of the previous
SBA in 2003, growth rebounded to almost twice its long-term average, per capita income
has surged to its highest level in 8 years after a prolonged decline, and extreme poverty
was reduced by almost one third. This impressive performance was underpinned by the
re-establishment of fiscal and monetary discipline, which reduced the consolidated public
debt-to-GDP ratio by one half, contained inflation, strengthened the guaraní by over one
third, and raised international reserves to a historical peak.

•

The current program remains broadly on track. All quantitative and structural
performance criteria and all but three structural benchmarks through end-April 2007 were
observed. The economy grew faster than expected in 2006 and continued expanding in
early 2007. However, inflation was higher than programmed in the latter part of 2006 due
to supply shocks that began to unwind in early 2007. Fiscal discipline was preserved
despite pressures. Large foreign exchange inflows continued, leading to record high
reserves and a significant appreciation of the currency.

Challenges and Appraisal
•

Raising growth on a sustainable basis and addressing widespread poverty are the
main challenges. Discussions with the authorities centered around five reform areas:
(i) strengthening macroeconomic management; (ii) reinforcing fiscal institutions;
(iii) tackling financial weaknesses; (iv) developing a pro-growth policy agenda; and
(v) designing an effective poverty reduction policy.

•

The macroeconomic program for 2007 aims at raising growth and reducing
inflation. The authorities will preserve fiscal discipline and pursue a prudent monetary
stance consistent with a core inflation objective of 5 percent. The external outlook
remains positive, with international reserves increasing faster than projected.

•

The structural agenda for 2007 aims at deepening reforms. The program includes a
wide range of reforms to address the problem areas identified during the consultation
discussions. Owing to changes in the leadership of the Central Bank and a complex
political environment, some reforms had to be re-phased, including the strategy to
strengthen the financial position of the Central Bank, the amendments to the banking law,
and improvements of the banking regulatory and supervisory frameworks.

•

Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation continues within the
24-month cycle, and supports completion of the second and third SBA reviews.

I. ACHIEVEMENTS AND PROSPECTS
1.
Accomplishments. Following a decade of stagnation and instability and a quarter
century of declining living standards, Paraguay has experienced some of the best
macroeconomic outcomes in recent years.

appropriate fiscal adjustment effort helped
regularize payments, eliminate arrears, and reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio by one half. This
effort was accompanied by a cautious monetary policy, which limited core inflation,
strengthened the guaraní and tripled international reserves.
2.
Reforms. Since 2003, the country implemented a number of initiatives aimed at
modernizing the economy, reducing impediments to growth, and improving deep-rooted
governance issues. The reforms include: (i) the fiscal adjustment law (which introduced the
personal income tax, eliminated tax exemptions and broadened the tax base); (ii) the customs
code (which strengthened the autonomy of customs); (iii) the banking resolution law (which
set up the deposit guarantee fund); (iv) the public pension fund law (which introduced a
parametric reform on this fund); and (v) the second tier-public banking law (which created
the Financial Development Agency to intermediate long-term funds provided by donors).
Evidence of improved governance comes from a sharp improvement in tax administration
and revenue collections, a rapid recovery of non-performing loans at the National
Development Bank (BNF), and the enactment of a strict procurement law.1
3.
Outlook. International and regional prospects remain favorable, facilitating an
expansion of Paraguayan exports and supporting the ongoing economic recovery. An end to a
three-year drought is expected to be translated into good crops, especially soybeans.
4.
Risks. The main external risk is a sudden change in the favorable global and regional
environment due to an abrupt slowdown in U.S. growth, tighter conditions in financial
markets, and a disorderly unwinding of global imbalances. The balance of payments remains
vulnerable to risks affecting the burgeoning beef export sector (such as an outbreak of footand-mouth disease) or, more generally, from the spillover of shocks from the much larger
neighboring countries. The most serious domestic risk is the possibility of political stalemate
and policy impasse in the pre-electoral period. Presidential elections are scheduled for
April 2008.

In the latest ranking of the corruption perception index compiled by Transparency International, Paraguay
moved up more than 30 positions (the largest improvement) from position 144 (out of 159 countries) in 2005 to
111 (out of 163) in 2006.

II. TRENDS AND DEVELOPMENTS
A. Economic Conditions
5.
Growth. The expansion that began in 2003 continued through 2006, as real GDP rose
about 4 percent, surpassing the program objective of

6.
Inflation. It has been quite volatile given the economy’s high vulnerability to
external shocks.2 Efforts to reduce inflation

continued in 2006 with mixed results. While core

10 percent in 2005 to 7 percent (in line with the
program objective), headline inflation increased

from 10 percent in 2005 to 12½ percent. Two short5.0
term factors explain this increase: (i) stricter

application of sanitary controls on imports of

vegetables, which reduced supplies and increased
-2.5
vegetable prices by almost 100 percent; and
Jan 04 Jul 04 Jan 05 Jul 05 Jan 06 Jul 06 Jan 07
(ii) increased access to beef markets abroad, which
raised domestic beef prices by over 30 percent. The supply shocks unwound in the first five
months of 2007 (as sanitary controls were relaxed and domestic beef supplies increased in
response to higher prices), and the 12-month rate of headline inflation fell to about 7 percent
in May 2007.
Paraguay: Consolidated Public Debt

7.
Debt Sustainability. The consolidated public
debt-to-GDP ratio increased almost fourfold in the second
half of the 1990’s and reached over 70 percent by 2002,
owing to large fiscal imbalances, a depressed economy
and a depreciated currency. One of the major
accomplishments of the current administration has been
to put the public finances on a sound footing and the
debt-to-GDP ratio on a declining path through an orderly

process of adjustment, assisted by a strengthening of the economy and the guaraní. Over the
last four years, the consolidated public debt-to-GDP ratio fell one half to about 35 percent

Fiscal Performance. The public finances improved considerably in the last few

The strong external position continued during the first five months of 2007, and the Central
Bank raised its pace of foreign exchange intervention to avoid an abrupt appreciation of the
currency. The main source of the foreign exchange inflows switched from binational
hydroelectric plants in 2006 to the private sector in 2007. However, as intervention was only
sterilized in part, currency growth rose to over 20 percent by end-May 2007, creating a
potential liquidity overhang.

Paraguay signed bilateral treaties with Brazil and Argentina in the 1970’s to create two independent binational hydroelectric plants (Itaipú and Yacyretá) which exploit the Paraná river at different border points. As
part of the treaties, each binational entity pays royalties to the government of Paraguay. In addition, Paraguay
sells back most of its energy to the neighboring countries.

Financial Intermediation. Banks have resumed
lending activities taking advantage of improved
macroeconomic conditions after the credit crunch of 2002.
Credit to the private sector grew by 18 percent in 2006,
reaching 13½ percent of GDP. Improved market
confidence and the stronger guaraní have led to a marked
decline in dollarization from over 65 percent of assets and
liabilities in 2002 to less than 50 percent in 2006.

External Sector. The external position has improved greatly in recent years,

supported by a benign international and regional
environment and a reflow of previous capital flight. This
allowed the Central Bank to raise international reserves
from US$0.6 billion at end-2002 to over US$2 billion by
end-May 2007, while the guaraní strengthened by
35 percent against the U.S. dollar. During 2006, the
overall external position improved further, despite a
deterioration of the current account (due to a surge in
import demand), as the capital account remained strong.
Binational hydroelectric plants were a driving force in generating a large foreign exchange
surplus. Foreign exchange inflows continued in early 2007.

Status. Following a sharp rise during the period of
economic stagnation, the overall poverty index decreased
from almost 50 percent of the population in 2002 to less
than 40 percent in 2005. Social investment increased
substantially during the past ten years, helping achieve
significant progress in education—with illiteracy rates

2005—and improving health infrastructure. However, social spending (at about 10 percent of
GDP), is still somewhat low by Latin American standards, limiting health services coverage,
particularly in rural areas.
C. Political Environment
14.
Elections. Preparations have started in earnest for the April 2008 general elections.
Nomination of presidential candidates by their parties is expected in late 2007. Congress,
which is controlled by the opposition, is likely to intensify its opposition to government
initiatives as has happened over the past year.4 Expenditure pressures may increase towards
the end of the year given the pre-electoral period. Nonetheless, there are demands from the
business community to ensure that the economy is “insulated” from undue political
pressures.
III. PERFORMANCE UNDER THE PROGRAM
15.
Implementation. The program remains broadly on track despite the start of the
electoral period as the authorities pursued sound policies, and the external environment
remained favorable. This section reports on performance under the second review (i.e., endSeptember 2006 targets) and the third review (i.e., end-December 2006 targets). The reviews
have been delayed as the new leadership of the Central Bank needed time to reassess the
envisaged reforms in the financial sector.5
16.
Macroeconomic Program 2006. The overall fiscal targets for 2006 were observed as
a solid revenue performance continued, notwithstanding strong expenditure pressures in the
last quarter of 2006. The public wage bill target for 2006 was also met despite Congressional
approval in late 2006 of a supplementary budget (which increased the wage bill by almost
0.2 percent of GDP), thereby raising expenditure pressures and budget rigidities for 2007.
The credit and international reserve targets for 2006 were observed with considerable
margins as the Central Bank sterilized the bulk of large foreign exchange inflows. Monetary
policy was assisted by the strong fiscal policy and efforts to reduce the losses of the Central

In particular, Congress: (i) overrode the Presidential veto to the law that delayed the introduction of the
personal income tax to 2007 with a 2/3 majority in September 2006 (while this move will not have a significant
impact on tax collections in the short-term, it sends a negative signal to tax payers); (ii) did not approve in 2006
an IDB program loan for US$30 million with favorable terms (which effectively rolled over IDB
amortizations); and (iii) approved in September 2006 additional spending that increased the wage bill by almost
0.2 percent of GDP.

5

Former Central Bank President Monica Perez dos Santos resigned in mid-February 2007. Mr. German Rojas
(former BNF President) was confirmed by Congress as President of the Central Bank in late March 2007. In
addition, Congress also appointed three other members of the Central Bank Board, whose positions had been
vacant for almost a year.

and most of the structural benchmarks for the second and third program reviews.
•

BNF. The audited balance sheet showed a capital adequacy ratio (CAR) of
8½ percent in June 2006 (against a 5 percent target) and 18½ percent in December
2006 (against a 10 percent target), owing to high asset recovery and undistributed
profits.

•

Investment climate. The authorities submitted a plan to improve the investment
climate that aims at removing impediments to establishing private enterprises,
strengthening property rights, and enhancing competitiveness.

•

Tax code. The authorities
prepared a tax procedure code that
aims at strengthening procedures
and penalties related to tax
collections and providing better
legal and regulatory capacity to
the revenue collecting agencies.
The draft code was already
discussed with private sector
experts.

poor families, against a target of 7,000, and enhanced the provision of education and
health services to families living under extreme poverty.7
•

Banks. The strategy for banking reform experienced a serious setback. The
introduction of a key Central Bank regulation (resolution 8/03) was postponed by
more than 1½ years (to August 2008) after strong opposition from banks and their
borrowers, deteriorating significantly the climate for reform in this area.8 Given these
difficulties, the authorities could not implement program conditionality related to
additional prudential regulations nor send to Congress amendments to the banking
law. The authorities propose to reinvigorate the reform efforts in this area with a new
approach (see the section on financial sector policies for 2007).

•

BCP. While significant progress has been made in finding a solution to the financial
situation of the Central Bank, the strategy to strengthen its balance sheet has not been
finalized. Consequently, the authorities did not send the legal and budgetary
implication of such strategy to Congress. The authorities are requesting to reset these
benchmarks.

•

Fuel Issues. With fluctuations in international oil prices, domestic price adjustments,
and the appreciation of the guaraní, diesel subsidies have been reduced significantly
in line with policy intentions to liberalize the diesel price.9

18.
External Issues 2006. The authorities reiterated their commitment to eliminate
PETROPAR arrears by September 2007; these amounted to almost US$30 million at end2006. Some progress was made in dealing with the debts in dispute.10
7

A preliminary evaluation of the program suggests that it was effective in alleviating extreme poverty and in
raising economic activity in the areas where these families live.

8

Resolution 8/03 would have strengthened bank’s loan classification and provisioning requirements. However,
bank borrowers feared that the resolution would deteriorate their credit rating and bankers opposed to it because
they worry about unfair competition from financial cooperatives, which are not subject to prudential
regulations. The Central Bank is encouraging banks to adhere to resolution 8/03 on a voluntary basis. This
resolution was approved by the Central Bank board in November 2003 and was expected to enter into effect in
January 2007. There was no conditionality attached to resolution 8/03 under the SBA.

9

The law to provide subsidies to transport companies (in compensation for diesel price adjustments) was
submitted to Congress in May 2006, but has not been approved yet.

10

There were three kind of claims in dispute at end-2006 amounting to some US$170 million or about
1¾ percent of GDP: (i) Belgium’s Ex-Herstal (US$7 million), negotiations continue between both parties;
(ii) French and Swiss import verification companies (US$75 million), the authorities continue studying possible
solutions; in the meantime, the French company (BIVAC) submitted a claim against Paraguay at the World
Bank Settlement Body (ICSID) in April 2007; and (iii) European and American banks, following a Swiss court
ruling against Paraguay (US$85 million), the authorities have decided to elevate the case to the International
Court of Justice in The Hague.

collaboration with the World Bank and

authorities’ macroeconomic policies and structural reform agenda for 2007. These policies
and reforms are consistent with the medium-term framework presented in the May 2006
program (Country Report No. 06/302).
A. Strengthening Macroeconomic Management
20.
Macroeconomic Stability. There was broad agreement that continued strengthening
of the fiscal and monetary frameworks is needed to entrench macroeconomic stability and
create the conditions for faster growth and poverty reduction. The authorities stressed their
commitment to maintaining macroeconomic stability, but noted that this task would be more
demanding in the forthcoming pre-electoral period. The authorities’ program aims at raising
real GDP growth to the 4–5 percent range in 2007 and 2008, while reducing core inflation to
5 percent (within a +/- 2½ percent range) in 2007 and 3 percent in 2008. Key elements of the
program include (Box 1) (¶6):11, 12

Fiscal Policy 2007. The authorities are strengthening their ability to conduct countercyclical fiscal policies, while preserving fiscal sustainability, and therefore are
targeting broad fiscal balance for 2007. This would imply a tightening of policy

19
Box 1. Paraguay: The Focus of Macroeconomic Policies
Assessing the cyclical position of the economy is essential to avoid policies that exacerbate
economic fluctuations. Different methodologies can be used to estimate the output gap. A key policy
objective is to conduct counter-cyclical policies to minimize the variability of output. Other important
considerations are debt sustainability for fiscal policy and price stability for monetary policy.
The economy appears to be above its potential after coming out of a long period of stagnation and
instability. Since the high-growth episode in the 1970s with average growth of 7.7 percent, Paraguay
has experienced very poor performance culminating in a decade of stagnation with recurrent crises in the
late 1990s. However, since 2003, the average rate of growth has recovered to 3.5 percent. In addition,
the recent growth period seems to be associated with less volatility. Various methodologies to estimate
the output gap (Cobb-Douglas production function, Okun’s Law, or statistical filters such as HodrickPrescott filter or the “Ideal” Pass filter) suggest that the economy is currently above its long-term trend
(see Chapter I in the companion Selected Issues Paper).
Although mildly countercyclical, fiscal policy
needs to be strengthened to better “lean against
the wind.” Fiscal policy was assessed using the
fiscal impulse methodology. Fiscal policy was
broadly neutral in the early 1990s and supportive
of growth during the protracted crises of the late
1990s. During 2000–04, fiscal policy was on
average countercyclical and contributed
significantly to the reduction of the debt ratio.
However, in 2005–06, despite the high point in the
business cycle, fiscal policy was not as strong as a
proper countercyclical policy would have dictated
(although this reflects in part increased public
investment).

Monetary policy was geared more toward stabilizing the exchange rate but recently more
emphasis has been given to controlling inflation. The previous focus on the exchange rate as a policy
objective reflects the high degree of

where the monetary rule responds to the
traditional determinants of inflation and output gap. In 2005–06, however, a change too recent to be
captured in regression analysis, interest rates were raised to respond to inflationary pressures. Over the
medium-run, Paraguay would gain from pursuing consistently a monetary policy more focused on
inflation.

The 2007 budget approved by Congress in December 2006 envisages a deficit of ¾ percent of GDP, which
effectively implies a deficit of 1¾ percent of GDP, once adjustments are made for more realistic revenue
collections. As in previous years, however, the authorities have adopted a financial plan to contain current
expenditures and avoid unnecessary delays in the execution of the investment program.

14

In line with previous practice, the 2007 fiscal targets can be relaxed in the context of program reviews if
additional capital spending on high quality projects is identified, provided it is accompanied with adequate
financing and does not jeopardize macroeconomic stability. The staff does not expect this additional public
investment to exceed ½ percent of GDP.

21
Box 2. Paraguay: Fiscal Challenges
An ambitious fiscal reform agenda needs to be put in place to support growth and poverty
reduction. The medium-term fiscal agenda should consolidate recent improvements in public finances
and deepen the reform in a number of areas, including by: (i) locking in revenue gains; (ii) reorienting
expenditure and reducing rigidities; and (iii) strengthening budgetary procedures and expenditure
financial management (see Chapter II on fiscal reform in the companion Selected Issues Paper).

Tax revenue (in percent of GDP)

Revenues. The tax revenue-to-GDP ratio has been relatively low compared to other countries in the
region, although it has improved in
recent years. A tax reform aimed at

other international institutions. These
achievements need to be supplemented by additional efforts to strengthen revenue administration and
improve revenue performance further. The legal ambiguity of the civil service law regarding the career
system of civil servants is delaying needed reforms in human resource for Customs and the Tax Office.
Expenditures. Key objectives of an expenditure policy will be to reduce further budget rigidity and
enhance spending efficiency. To accomplish these objectives, it would be important to link wage
increases to productivity improvements, adopt attrition policies, reduce government contribution to
pensions, restrict revenue earmarking, enhance efficiency in the use of public resources (i.e., by
strengthening public investment criteria), and set hard budget constraints to the judicial and legislative
branches. The wage bill is relatively high, and claims almost 80 percent of tax revenue and more than
40 percent of general government spending. The pension system coverage is low by regional standards
for both active workers and the elderly, but the budgetary transfers to the system are relatively large.
There is no independent capacity to evaluate investment projects and to assist in its prioritization,
causing the capital budget to be spread too thin.
Central Government: Deviations Between Budgets and Outturns
Budget. The Public Financial Management system has
some weaknesses. The budget process needs to
enhance transparency, discipline, realism, and
accountability, as well as its legal framework. The lack
of realism in the budget translates in systematic overbudgeting at the budget formulation stage which leads
to a high degree of uncertainty about the stance of
fiscal policy. It is important to establish a mediumterm framework to improve budget preparation,
prioritization, and sustainability.

mix was designed to accommodate a large influx of foreign exchange observed in the
first four months of 2007. The authorities feared that a significant part of these
amounts were temporary private capital flows and decided to intervene to prevent an
abrupt appreciation of the currency. They also reduced significantly interest rates on
the benchmark LRMs by over 600 basis points to about 4½ percent to discourage
further inflows. While real interest rates are still positive in the short-run, nominal
interest rates may need to be raised in the next months to maintain domestic credit
within program limits and achieve the core inflation objective. Foreign exchange
inflows fell significantly by end-April 2007 (¶12). Over the medium term the
authorities intend to reduce inflation to industrial country levels.
•

Exchange Rate Policy 2007. The authorities will maintain a flexible exchange rate
with intervention aimed at achieving their net international reserve target as well as
smoothing out large and/or seasonal transactions (¶12). The staff considers that
Paraguay’s floating exchange rate regime is appropriate in light of the need to absorb
shocks. The recent strengthening of the

the strengthening of the current account and
the higher foreign direct investment may signal some shift in the equilibrium real
exchange rate. The staff believes that it is too early to tell if the inflows of the last few
months were due to temporary capital inflows (a regional phenomenon) or more
permanent improvements in the current account, and suggested to the authorities to
monitor closely the situation and be prepared to allow the guaraní to appreciate if
there is conclusive evidence that the fundamentals have strengthened.

•

External Sector 2007. The current account
deficit as a percent of GDP is projected to fall
slightly in 2007 mostly due to improvements in
the trade balance as Paraguay will continue to
benefit from strong agricultural exports. The
capital account is projected to show another
large surplus, mainly owing to foreign direct
investment.

An update of a standard model to assess the REER against its fundamentals shows similar
econometric results.1 The model includes traditional determinants of equilibrium exchange rate
(EER). Better terms of trade and higher net foreign assets lead to appreciations of the EER through
wealth effects. Trade openness increases competition in tradable goods, thus depreciating the EER,

However, the results suggest that the undervaluation of the REER following the 2002 crisis
has been corrected, and that the REER may currently be stronger than suggested by its
fundamentals. The figure below presents the regression residuals (i.e., short-term misalignment) as

addition, in the first quarter of 2007, the REER appreciated further. However, while the model does

changes that are not yet adequately reflected in the data series (such as increased productivity in
agroindustrial sectors, improved terms of trade, higher NFA, and better GDP growth prospects).

Medium-Term Scenario. The scenario presented in the staff report for the SBA
request (Country Report No. 06/302) remains valid in view of the authorities’
commitment to continue pursuing prudent macroeconomic policies and implementing
structural reforms to sustain growth, supported by favorable external conditions.
Prudent macroeconomic policies should aim at increasing public resources to reduce
poverty and improve infrastructure, and broad-based economic reforms should help
entrench stability, and sustain medium-term growth by encouraging private
investment, and augmenting productivity. Under this scenario, real GDP growth
would rise to 5 percent by 2010, while price and financial stability would be
maintained. Continued fiscal consolidation would permit a decline of the public debtto-GDP ratio to just over 20 percent by 2012 (see Appendix 5 for a debt sustainability
analysis).
B. Reinforcing Fiscal Institutions

21.
Medium-Term Institutional Reform. In view of Paraguay’s institutional
weaknesses, there was agreement on the need for a medium-term reform of fiscal institutions
to promote fiscal sustainability, improve the flexibility of fiscal policy, and support long-term
growth potential by better targeting social spending and infrastructure investment. Work in
most of these areas has already begun, and will continue over the next years. The reforms
include: (i) enhancing the institutional framework of tax and customs administrations to
consolidate recent revenue gains and support additional revenue mobilization;
(ii) strengthening public financial management, in particular the budget framework, to
improve expenditure efficiency and control; (iii) reducing budget rigidities to permit a more
flexible expenditure allocation process; (iv) rationalizing the civil service to improve service
delivery; and (v) reforming the pensions regime to increase coverage and secure financial
sustainability (Box 2).15
22.
2007 Institutional Fiscal Policies. In view of the discussions and the challenges
ahead, the authorities are focusing their efforts in 2007 on institutional fiscal policies in four
areas:16
•

Tax code. The authorities are strengthening the institutional framework for tax
collection. In particular, they have recently drafted a tax procedures code, and they
are preparing the implementing regulations (¶14).17 This involves the drafting of legal

15

and policies in the program.

See Appendix 6 for a detailed description of the technical assistance program, which was designed to support

25
provisions to develop new streamlined compliance control procedures. The staff
encouraged the authorities to reach a consensus within civil society before submitting
a draft tax code to Congress, and then work with the relevant commission to explain
the policies and ensure its approval.
•

Pension reform. In view of the low coverage, lack of regulation, fragmented structure
of the pension system, and the need to minimize contingent liabilities, the authorities
will develop a pension reform plan aimed at addressing these concerns and ensuring
the long-term solvency of the pension system (¶15). The staff recommended that the
plan be followed by a parametric reform of the whole system.

•

Expenditure control. To strengthen the ability of the Ministry of Finance to limit
expenditures, the authorities will establish an expenditure control system at the
commitment level for the Executive

control; the authorities are in the process of reducing the number of public accounts
with a view to achieve the single account.

•

Public investment. To achieve a better integration between the long-term objectives
of specific sectors and the investment projects being selected, the Ministry of Finance
will design a public sector investment system that ensures that programs reflect
government priorities, improves prioritization and efficiency, maximizes investment
return, and removes budget rigidities (¶15).
C. Tackling Financial System Weaknesses

23.
Strengthening the Financial System. The authorities agreed that the low
intermediation capacity of the financial system hinders economic growth, and are considering
a wide range of reforms that are in line with the recommendations made by the 2005 FSAP.
17

The recently drafted tax procedures code consolidates tax legislation and aims at increasing tax revenue due
under existing tax laws. The tax administration has to enforce compliance while at the same time assist
taxpayers to comply with tax laws’ requirements. In this vein, the draft tax procedures code intends to establish
a proper balance between the powers of the tax administration to administer the tax laws and the protection of
taxpayers’ rights.

26
These include: (i) strengthening the financial position of the Central Bank; (ii) improving the
framework for monetary operations; (iii) upgrading banking regulation and supervision;
(iv) restructuring public banks (especially BNF); (v) strengthening the regulation and
supervision of financial cooperatives; (vi) developing domestic capital markets; and
(vii) enhancing the payment system.18
24.
2007 Financial Sector Policies. The authorities stressed their commitment to address
the shortcomings of the financial system, and regretted recent setbacks in the implementation
of the financial sector reform agenda. They noted that implementation of some reforms will
take longer than anticipated because of the complex political landscape in 2007, and
therefore their efforts will concentrate on the following areas:
•

Monetary authority. The authorities are determined to address the Central Bank’s
negative income position, and are designing a strategy to strengthen the financial
position of the Central Bank. They intend to submit to Congress a bill with the legal
and budgetary implications of the strategy by September 2007 (¶18). This financial
exercise will allow the Central Bank to focus more on monetary policy issues rather
than the implication of its actions on the balance sheet.

•

National Development Bank. The authorities intend to continue their efforts to
strengthen the national development bank

•

Payments system. To address weaknesses in the payments system, facilitate the
development of capital markets, and mobilize financial resources, the Central Bank is
preparing a draft law to revamp the payments system (¶16). Furthermore, the

18

and policies in the program. See also Appendix 4 for an assessment and update of the status of the financial
system.

27
authorities will intensify their efforts to put in place a real-time gross settlement
system (RTGS) and an automatic clearing house (ACH).
•

Capital markets. The authorities agreed that the financial strengthening of the Central
Bank will provide opportunities for developing capital markets. They are designing a
comprehensive strategy for the development of capital markets, including by
promoting the domestic securities market and strengthening the public debt
management system (¶19).

•

Cooperatives. The authorities believe that a strengthening of the regulatory,
supervisory and monitoring framework for the largest cooperatives is key to the
financial sector reform. The objective is to reduce the difference in the regulatory
framework for different kinds of financial institutions and to minimize systemic
financial vulnerabilities and distortions (¶16).

•

Commercial banks. The Central Bank has developed a new approach to upgrading
banking regulation and supervision, addressing remaining weaknesses identified in
the FSAP exercise. This approach includes: (i) designing a strengthened strategy to
achieve at least 80 percent of the Basel Core Principles for banking supervision over
the medium-term (consistent with best practice in the region); (ii) approving a
modified resolution 8/03—which seeks to strengthen bank’s loan classification and
provisioning requirements—to become effective by January 1, 2008 (see
Appendix 4); and (iii) implementing prudential regulations in line with the Central
Bank’s operational plan (¶16).
D. Developing a Pro-Growth Policy Agenda
25.
Raising Productivity. The authorities pointed to progress made in the last few
years, and stressed that achievement of permanent gains in potential output growth through
raising productivity is part of their medium-term, broad-based agenda aimed at boosting
per-capita income growth.19
26.
2007 Growth Policies. The authorities noted that their efforts in 2007 will focus on
two areas:

•

19

Investment climate. The authorities expressed concern about the low level of private
investment in the economy. To address this problem, they will implement the action
plan designed in the fall of 2006, which aims at removing disincentives for
investment, and enhancing the business and investment climate (¶20). The
authorities’ plan rests on five main pillars: (i) facilitate enterprise creation;

See Chapter IV in the companion Selected Issues Paper for a detailed description of growth issues and
policies in the program.

28
(ii) strengthen land property rights; (iii) create a one-stop window for exporters;
(iv) reinforce the competitiveness of the export sector; and (v) improve the
mechanism for reimbursing VAT.
•

Public enterprises. The staff noted that a significant factor for the low growth rates of
the last decade was the drag caused

E. Towards an Effective Poverty Reduction Policy

27.
Poverty Alleviation. Poverty remains a serious problem with one in three people
living below the poverty line and one in six people living in conditions of extreme poverty.
Poverty alleviation programs have had a limited impact in raising living standards of the poor
because of institutional limitations and weaknesses in design. Against this backdrop, the
authorities are looking to strengthen poverty alleviation programs, with improved targeting
and control mechanisms and sufficient budgetary allocations to ensure their implementation.
The staff welcomed these intentions and recommended (after consultations with the World
Bank and the IDB) that the authorities’ efforts to reduce poverty be comprehensive,
integrating work in education, health and the provision of basic services like water and
electricity.21

The management contracts signed between the government and five large public enterprises (ANDE,
COPACO, ESSAP, INC, and PETROPAR) aim at improving efficiency, transparency, communications and
quality of services. The contracts are based on simple and clear rules but ambitious objectives that are
monitored continuously through a scoreboard approach. There are multiple quantitative and qualitative targets
(including commercial, economic, financial, operational and service indicators) that are transparently monitored
and leads to quarterly assessments.

population living in extreme poverty. They highlighted the conditional cash transfer program
(CCT) as the most important of such measures. They intend to increase the coverage of their
CCT program from 8,800 families in 2006 to 15,000 during 2007 (¶22). The staff encouraged
the authorities to sharpen their poverty alleviation policy further.
V. PROGRAM ISSUES
29.
Conditionality. The structure of quantitative performance criteria is the same as last
year’s program. Conditionality for 2008 will be set at the time of the fifth review (expected
for late 2007). The program envisages the implementation of measures associated with
benchmarks not met in 2006, as follows:
•

Central bank’s balance sheet strengthening. Reset the benchmark on the design of a
strategy to strengthen the financial position of the Central Bank to June 2007.

•

Implications of strategy on central bank strengthening. Reset the benchmark on
sending to Congress the budgetary and legal implications of the above mentioned
strategy to September 2007.

•

Prudential regulations. Change the previous benchmark on implementing regulatory
measures to strengthen the financial system (including sending to Congress
amendments to the banking law) for a new approach. The new formulation will
include three new benchmarks: (i) design a strategy to increase compliance with
Basel Core Principles of banking supervision to 80 percent by end-June 2007;
(ii) approve a modified resolution 8/03 by end-September 2007, which will become
effective by January 1st, 2008; and (iii) implement prudential regulations according to
the Central Bank’s operational plan by end-December 2007.

30.
Rephasing. The original schedule of purchases envisaged the completion of three
additional purchases by June 2007 associated with the second, third, and fourth program
reviews respectively. These reviews have not been completed as scheduled because it took
longer than expected to agree on financial policies for 2007. However, one of these purchases
(fourth review) was linked to conditionality in 2007 that had not yet been established. For
that reason, only two reviews are proposed to be completed, and one purchase needs to be
rephased. In particular, it is proposed that the purchase associated with end-March 2007
targets (SDR 6 million) be split by augmenting the purchase associated with end-September
2007 targets (by SDR 3½ million), and the one associated with the end-December 2007
targets (by SDR 2½ million). The authorities intend to continue treating the arrangement as
precautionary.
31.
Access. In view of the significant improvement in their external position, the
authorities are considering requesting a reduction in access under this arrangement in the
context of the next program review.

30
32.
Adjustor. An adjustor to the overall balance of the central government equivalent to
the direct transfers or interest costs associated with the financial strengthening of the central
bank is proposed.22 This adjustor does not modify the consolidated public sector fiscal target.
VI. STAFF APPRAISAL
33.
Achievements. After a prolonged decline in per-capita income, Paraguay has
implemented critical reforms in the last few years that have reversed the decline and started
to reduce poverty. Paraguay’s achievements include: (i) the beginning of a growth process
with rates well above historical averages; (ii) fiscal discipline and placement of the public
debt on a sustainable path; (iii) the rapid buildup of international reserves in the context of a
strengthened currency; and (iv) the speedy recovery of the financial system after the 2002
crisis. While these are major accomplishments, Paraguay faces significant challenges such as
the need to entrench macroeconomic stability and intensify reforms to establish the
conditions for sustained growth, and to address a number of vulnerabilities. The authorities
are determined to address these challenges with sound policies and a high degree of
ownership.
34.
Fiscal policy. The authorities’ intention to achieve overall fiscal balance in 2007 and
to implement the necessary expenditure cuts with respect to the budget approved by
Congress is commendable. The authorities have been able to maintain fiscal discipline
despite a difficult political environment and intense expenditure pressures. For the fourth
consecutive year, the Ministry of Finance had to resort to the use of a financial plan to
conduct fiscal policy given tensions with the approved budget. The situation became more
complicated at the end of 2006 after Congress approved a supplementary budget to satisfy
demands from the Judicial Branch. To improve the conduct and transparency of fiscal policy,
it is therefore important to strengthen the budgetary framework and to establish overall limits
that cannot be breached. The gains in tax administration need to be locked in, and the
authorities’ efforts to design and adopt a modern tax code are welcome.
35.
Monetary policy. The proposed monetary program is appropriate and the inflation
and reserves objectives of the monetary program are ambitious but achievable. The Central
Bank has struck a balance between allowing an appreciation of the guaraní and accumulating
reserves. Close monitoring of developments will continue to be important, as the authorities
will need to respond promptly to signs of inflationary pressures and/or monetary imbalances.
36.
Financial system. While significant progress has been made towards enhancing the
health of the financial system, the staff is disappointed that the political climate has delayed
the much-needed financial sector reform, particularly the strengthening of bank regulation
22

The issuance of government securities to strengthen the financial position of the Central Bank will not have a
bearing in the measurement of the fiscal balance of the central government.

31
through resolution 8/03 and amendments to the banking law that would have reduced
identified weaknesses. The authorities’ plan to regain momentum in this area is welcome,
and they are urged to implement the measures envisaged in their redesigned financial sector
reform. With banks having record high profits and record low non-performing loans, this
appears to be the best possible time to implement such reforms. These efforts need to be
reinforced by the necessary amendments to the banking law, as soon as political
circumstances permit.
37.
Structural reform. The authorities are encouraged to maintain the momentum of
reform and to implement the ambitious reform agenda for 2007 in order to improve
productivity and thereby achieve sustained growth. The reform agenda is appropriately multipronged given the challenges ahead. The authorities’ determination to implement structural
reforms in several areas is commendable and they are advised to maintain the same level of
commitment and dynamism in pursuing this agenda.
38.
Risks. While there are several international and regional risks, the main risk in the
short-run is the pressures to loosen policies in the pre-electoral period. The authorities have
been successful in fending off political pressures to increase expenditures in the past, and this
effort will need to continue, as the presidential race begins.
39.
Reviews. The staff supports completion of second and third reviews under the SBA in
light of the good performance and strong ownership of the program.
40.
Consultation. The staff proposes that the next Article IV consultation takes place
within the 24-month cycle.

APPENDIX 1. PARAGUAY—LETTER OF INTENT)

Asunción, Paraguay
June 15, 2007

Mr. Rodrigo de Rato
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431

Dear Mr. de Rato:
1.
This letter and the attached memorandum of economic and financial policies (MEFP)
update and supplement our letters of May 8, and September 12, 2006; describe performance
under our economic program for 2006 and early 2007; and propose our economic program
for the rest of 2007. The attached MEFP articulates, in some detail, the economic policies
that the government intends to carry out during 2007 as well as the key targets of the
program. The government’s objectives continue to be the consolidation of our stabilization
efforts while establishing policies to foster private investment, enhance employment, remove
impediments to growth and reduce poverty on a sustainable basis.
2.
Performance under our economic program, supported by a 27-month Stand-By
Arrangement (SBA), has been quite strong. All quantitative and structural performance
criteria through end-March 2007 were observed. With three exceptions (explained by the
changes at the Central Bank leadership), all structural benchmarks were also met. Economic
growth remains strong and inflation under control. The public finances are on a strong
footing and international reserves are at a record high level.
3.
To continue supporting our efforts, the Government of Paraguay hereby requests:
(i) complete the second and third reviews under the SBA supported program; (ii) reschedule
the missed structural benchmarks on designing the strategy to strengthen the financial
position of the Central Bank to end-June 2007; (iii) modify the missed structural benchmark
on implementing regulatory measures outlined in the banking strategy and sending to
Congress amendments to the banking law to three new structural benchmark on: (a) the
design of an ambitious action plan to strengthen financial sector reform and aiming at
increasing the coverage of Basel Core Principles of banking supervision to around 80 percent
by end-June 2007; (b) approval of a modified resolution 8/03 by end-September 2007 with a
view to become effective on January 1, 2008; and (c) implementation of prudential
regulations in line with the Central Bank’s operational plan by end-December 2007;

45
(iv) introduce an adjustor to the target on the Central Government balance for the cost of
strengthening the financial position of the Central Bank; (v) move the fourth and fifth
program reviews to mid-September and mid-December 2007 respectively, and switch to
semi-annual program reviews (while retaining quarterly performance criteria) after the fifth
SBA review; and (vi) rephase purchases according to the changes in reviews described
before. We intend to continue treating the arrangement as precautionary.
4.
The government of Paraguay will maintain the continuous and fruitful dialogue with
the Fund, the government believes that the policies set forth in the attached MEFP are
adequate to achieve the objectives of its program, but we will take any further measures that
may become appropriate for this purpose. In the spirit of cooperation, Paraguay will consult
with the Fund on the adoption of these measures, in accordance with the Fund’s policies on
such consultation. We will also provide Fund staff with all the relevant information required
to complete program reviews and monitor performance.
5.
As part of our information policy, we intend to publish this letter and the attached
MEFP on the websites of the Ministry of Finance and Central Bank to keep the public
informed. We also authorize the Fund to publish these documents to facilitate a wider
dissemination of our policies among the international community.

Sincerely yours,

_________/s/_________
Germán Rojas
President
Central Bank of Paraguay

APPENDIX 2. MEMORANDUM OF ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES OF THE
GOVERNMENT OF PARAGUAY (MEFP)
I. BACKGROUND
1.
Following the successful stabilization of the period 2003–05, the government
adopted an ambitious economic program for 2006-08 to promote growth and reduce
poverty while entrenching macroeconomic stability. Right after taking office, the
administration of President Duarte-Frutos designed a program to stabilize the economy,
address deep-rooted macroeconomic imbalances and lessen remaining regional contagion.
The program was supported by a Stand-By Arrangement from the IMF and quickly began to
bear fruit. During the stabilization period of 2003–05 we achieved some of the best
macroeconomic results in a decade. The economy began to grow; the public finances were
adjusted in an orderly manner; the financial system was strengthened; and the Central Bank
tightened its control on inflation while managing to increase international reserves to record
highs. These stabilizing efforts were underscored by the successful completion of the SBA in
November 2005. Subsequently, we embarked upon designing a program for the period
2006-08 with the objective of removing impediments to growth, and alleviating poverty,
while cementing economic stability. The program contains an ambitious structural reform
agenda and a strong macroeconomic component. The medium-term objectives of the
program are to keep the growth rate of the economy to 4–5 percent; to tend to reduce
inflation to industrial country levels; keep the consolidated public debt burden below
30 percent of GDP; and maintain a comfortable international reserve position.
2.
The program remains on track as policy implementation was strengthened.
Performance under the program has been quite strong. Following strict adherence to all
targets for end-June 2006, all quantitative performance criteria for end-September and endDecember 2006 were observed.1 On the structural front, the two structural performance
criteria and all but three benchmarks were observed through end-April 2007.2 With the aim
1

The variables subject to quarterly quantitative performance criteria under the program include: (i) overall
balance of the Central Administration; (ii) wage bill of the Central Administration; (iii) overall balance of the
consolidated public sector; (iv) net international reserves of the Central Bank; (v) net domestic assets of the
Central Bank; (vi) contracting or guaranteeing of nonconcessional external debt by the nonfinancial public
sector; (vii) contracting or guaranteeing of short-term external debt by the nonfinancial public sector on a
continuous basis; and (viii) non-accumulation of external debt arrears on a continuous basis.

2

The list of structural measures observed through April 2007 include: (i) improve the capital-risk-weightedasset ratio of the National Development Bank (BNF) to 5 percent by end-June 2006 and 10 percent by endDecember 2006 according to an audited and inspected balance sheet (performance criterion); (ii) design a plan
to improve the business climate by end-September 2006; (iii) preparation of the tax code by end December
2006 (performance criterion); (iv) implement result-oriented management contracts for ANDE, COPACO,
ESSAP, INC and PETROPAR by end-December 2006; (v) creation of a conditional cash transfer system for
7,000 families living under conditions of extreme poverty based on contracts with beneficiaries by endDecember 2006. The missing benchmarks were: (i) implementation of the regulatory measures outlined in the
(continued)

48
areas: (i) public sector reform; (ii) financial sector reform; (iii) pro-growth agenda; and (iv) a
social safety net to alleviate poverty. Performance criteria and structural benchmarks for
2007 related to these policies are specified in Tables 1 and 2 and further defined in the
attached technical memorandum of understanding. Policies for 2008 will be articulated at the
time of the fifth program review, expected for late 2007.
II. MACROECONOMIC PROGRAM FOR 2007
6.
The macroeconomic framework for the 2007 program aims at raising growth
and reducing inflation. An important program objective will be to raise economic growth to
the 4-5 percent range in 2007. This objective seems realistic as agriculture is expected to
rebound and the supply effects of the structural reforms begin to have an impact on the
economy. Another key objective for the 2007 program is to tend to reduce the core inflation
rate to 5 percent (within a range of +/- 2½ percent), as the impact of supply shocks is
absorbed, and the Central Bank continues with an adequate control of monetary aggregates.
A. Fiscal Policy
7.
The program aims at maintaining fiscal discipline while targeting higher capital
spending. The 2007 budget submitted to Congress envisaged a small deficit of 0.8 percent of
GDP. Given financing constraints and the objective to reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio, we have
designed a financial plan to limit spending and achieve a balanced fiscal position. The
program’s objective is to contain non-social current expenditures of the Central
Administration while allowing for a higher level of capital and social expenditure to support
growth and poverty alleviation efforts. In particular, the program aims at increasing capital l
expenditure to 4½ percent of GDP and to further increase social spending.
8.
An adjustor will be introduced to facilitate the implementation of the structural
reform agenda. The fiscal targets will be adjusted to accommodate the cost of structural
reforms. In particular, the fiscal target for the Central Administration will be adjusted to take
into account the interest cost or additional transfers resulting from the government’s intention
to strengthen the financial position of the Central Bank. In the case of issuance of bonds, the
interest costs will be recorded as part of the expenditure of the Central Administration. This
adjustor will apply to the Central Administration, but not to the Consolidated Public Sector.
9.
As in the past, the program will endorse higher than targeted levels of public
investment and poverty alleviation programs, provided appropriate safeguards are in
place. The 2007 program will allow for a level of capital and targeted social expenditures
beyond program objectives provided that macroeconomic conditions allow the absorption of
these expenditures and there is revenue over-performance or else financing on appropriate
terms directed to high quality projects. This issue will be addressed in the context of program
reviews.

47
of strengthening program implementation, the Government issued decree 7712 in June 2006
by which the execution of specific measures under the program is delegated to individual
Ministries within the Government. The same decree also provides adequate control and
monitoring mechanisms to ensure a successful program implementation.
3.
Economic conditions continued to improve in 2006. Real GDP is estimated to have
grown by 4 percent, exceeding the program objective of 3½ percent for 2006, driven by a
combination of a strong external demand (buoyant exports, especially for beef) and a
dynamic domestic demand (higher private investment, especially in mobile telecommunications). Headline inflation exceeded the program objective of 7 percent for 2006,
mostly on account of a surge in beef prices in the regional and international markets;
however core inflation (excluding the beef price shock) was in line with the program
objective. The public finances remained with a small surplus in 2006, against a program
objective of fiscal balance, mainly due to strong tax collections and strict control on
expenditures. The Central Bank managed to accumulate a record level of reserves in 2006,
while maintaining control of monetary aggregates and allowing the guaraní to strengthen
against major international currencies, as the external position continued to be positive.
4.
Economic performance in the first quarter of 2007 was also strong, and
macroeconomic stability was further enhanced. Following the unwinding of the supply
shock observed at end-2006, the price level fell by 1½ percent, bringing down the 12-month
rate of headline inflation to about 6 percent by end-April. We have maintained strong fiscal
discipline, and the central government budget recorded a significant surplus in the first
quarter on account of continued strong revenue performance and expenditure restraint. The
export sector enjoyed robust growth as a result of continued productivity increases,
especially in soy and beef production, as well as from favorable external conditions. As a
result, we strengthened our reserve position by over US$300 million in the first four months
of 2007 to reach yet another historic record. In view of the positive external position, large
level of reserves, progress in implementing the program, and in recognition of the revolving
nature of the Fund resources, we request—in the context of the next program review—a
reduction in access under the Stand-By Arrangement (which would also reduce the
commitment fee).
5.
The program for 2007 envisages further consolidation of the stabilization gains
and further deepening of the reform agenda to achieve higher growth. The structure of
the 2007 program will be similar to that of 2006. The program will continue to be based on
five policy pillars, a strong macroeconomic program anchored by fours structural reform
Central Bank’s banking strategy and the amendments to the banking law according to the same strategy by endSeptember 2006; (ii) design of a strategy to strengthen the financial position of the Central Bank by endDecember 2006; and (iii) send to Congress a bill with the legal and budgetary implication of the
abovementioned strategy by mid-April 2007.

49
10.
The program seeks to achieve fiscal balance at the consolidated public sector
level. The rest of the public sector is expected to maintain its surplus position by restraining
current expenditures. This will help in covering the expected losses of the Central Bank or
the Central Administration once the Central Bank’s position is being strengthened.
B. Monetary Policy
11.
The key monetary policy objective of the 2007 program will be to maintain core
inflation at around 5 percent. While this may appear as an ambitious target given the end2006 headline inflation of 12½ percent, the core inflation was about 7 percent at the end of
the same period. Moreover, with a deflation of about 1½ percent in the first four months, the
12-month rate of inflation already fell to about 6 percent in April 2007. However, given the
variability of inflation and the vulnerability to external shocks, the Central Bank believes it is
prudent to adopt a range of plus/minus two and a half percentage points, making the core
inflation range 2½ to 7½ percent in 2007.
12.
To achieve the inflation objective, the Central Bank will maintain to reasonable
levels the growth of monetary aggregates. The Central Bank will follow a monetary policy
that is consistent with an economy growing at 4-5 percent, a core inflation objective of
5 percent (within a range of +/- 2½ percent), and a moderate strengthening in real money
demand. The Central Bank made large purchases of foreign exchange in the first quarter of
2007 to prevent the exchange rate from appreciating beyond fundamentals and reduced
interest rates to stop attracting foreign exchange inflows. For the rest of the year, the Central
Bank will focus its policy on controlling the pace of currency expansion through additional
placements of “Letras de Regulación Monetaria.” With a record level of international
reserves beyond US$2 billion at end-May 2007, the Central Bank does not have a need to
accumulate further reserves and might use part of the foreign exchange purchased earlier in
the year in case there is a reversal of the flows. In any case, the Central Bank level of
international reserves will not be below US$1.92 billion by end-2007.
III. STRUCTURAL REFORMS FOR 2007
13.
The structural reform agenda for 2007 will continue to build on the
accomplishments of the past year with the ultimate objective of removing impediments
to growth. Plans designed in 2006 will be implemented in 2007. Measures already agreed for
2007 will be executed during the year. Reforms that began last year will be finalized in
2007/08. In designing the reform agenda, we have minimized the use of legislative change.
However, in those cases where it has been impossible to make progress without some form of
legislative action, we will work closely with the National Congress to initiate the dialogue
and explain the rationale for the proposed legislation, increasing ownership of the reform
process and facilitating the approval of the proposed legislation.

50
A. Public Sector Reform
14.
The institutional framework for tax collection will continue to be strengthened.
The increases in tax collections of the last few years need to be locked in through the
adoption of a tax procedures code to ensure macroeconomic stability over the medium-term.
Following the design of a draft tax procedures code in December 2006, the Ministry of
Finance will prepare the implementing regulations for such tax procedures code by endSeptember 2007 (structural benchmark). We will continue requesting technical assistance
from the IMF for this purpose.
15.
A coherent public expenditure policy will be designed to improve the efficiency
of government spending. The current system is quite rigid and lacks adequate control
systems. Reforms are needed to ensure that expenditures are carried out in the areas with
higher social return.
•

Controls on current expenditures will be firmed up to better achieve agreed limits
and avoid undue fluctuations in spending patterns. Following the design of an
action plan to develop effective commitment control systems for the public sector in
June 2006, the Ministry of Finance will establish an expenditure control system at the
commitment level for the Executive Branch by end-December 2007 (structural
benchmark). This will require regulations and changes in the financial management
information system needed to record all budget execution stages. We will continue
requesting technical assistance from the IMF for this purpose.

•

Selection of investment projects will be strengthened to increase the efficiency of
capital expenditures. Given the shortfalls in project implementation and the lack of a
comprehensive system to establish priorities in public investment over the mediumterm, the Ministry of Finance will design a public sector investment system to
improve prioritization, efficiency, maximize investment return, and ensure that
programs reflect the government priorities by end-December 2007 (structural
benchmark). We will request technical assistance from the Inter-American
Development Bank for this purpose.

•

A comprehensive approach is needed to solve the common problems of the different
pension systems. This will complement the piecemeal approach adopted in the past to
solve the financial problems of specific pension systems. To this end, the Ministry of
Finance will develop an action plan for a pension reform aimed at ensuring its longterm solvency, appropriately endorsed by the Economic Cabinet by end-September
2007 (structural benchmark).
B. Financial Sector Reform

16.
Reforms are needed in a number of areas to enhance the functioning of the
financial system. Significant progress has been made in strengthening the architecture of the

51
domestic financial system since the emergence of the 2002 financial crisis (including by
upgrading the banking resolution framework, introducing deposit insurance, and improving
the financial situation of BNF) but additional steps are needed to consolidate those gains.
•

The supervisory and regulatory framework for banks needs to be strengthened. The
Central Bank will continue in their efforts to strengthen the financial system and will
take the following measures:
¾ The Central Bank will design an ambitious plan and timetable to reshape the
banking sector reform. The plan will address weaknesses in the regulatory and
supervisory frameworks of the banking system and will be finalized by end-June
2007 (structural benchmark). The plan will aim at increasing compliance with the
Basel Core Principles of Banking Supervision to the highest in the region (about
80 percent). We will continue requesting technical assistance from the IMF for
this purpose.
¾ A modified resolution 8/03 will be reinstated. The Central Bank will enter in a
process of consultation with the banking community with a view to reach
consensus on a modified resolution 8/03 to upgrade credit requirements, loan
classification and provisioning. The Central Bank Board will approve a modified
resolution 8/03 by end-September 2007 (structural benchmark), which will
become effective on January 1, 2008.
¾ Prudential regulations will be bolstered. The Central Bank Board will implement
a number of prudential regulations included in the Central Bank’s operational
plan (approved in November 2005) with the aim of strengthening criteria for
calculating capital requirements, improving rules for provisioning, streamlining
administrative sanctions proceedings, rationalizing rules on open net foreign
exchange positions and the public reporting on banks’ financial position by endDecember 2007 (structural benchmark). We will continue requesting technical
assistance from the IMF for this purpose.

•

A regulatory framework for cooperatives will be designed. To reduce regulatory and
supervisory differences between financial institutions, and reduce vulnerabilities to
the financial system, INCOOP will develop an effective supervisory and regulatory
framework for financial cooperatives by end-September 2007 (structural benchmark).
These efforts will aim at leveling the regulatory and supervisory playing field for
financial institutions in the country. INCOOP will also strengthen the monitoring
framework to compile monetary statistics for the main cooperatives, and their
incorporation in the Central Bank’s monetary statistics.

•

Measures will be taken to improve the payment system. As part of the modernization
efforts of the financial system to enhance liquidity management, facilitate

52
transactions and mobilize financial resources as well as improving the conduct of
monetary policy, the Central Bank will implement the regulatory framework
addressing weaknesses in the payment system, and in consultation with the
government, will prepare a draft payments system law approved by the economic
cabinet by end-September 2007 (structural benchmark). We aim at establishing a realtime gross settlements system (RTGS) by 2008. We will request technical assistance
from the IMF for this purpose.
17.
While significant progress has been made in strengthening the National
Development Bank, further efforts are needed to reduce the vulnerability of the system.
The program includes two main objectives on BNF
•

Further strengthening the bank’s financial position is still needed. A milestone of
the program has been to turn around BNF’s capital from negative (technically
bankrupt) to positive through improvements in its administration, which allowed for
profit increases and bad debt recoveries. The independent audit confirmed that our
objective to increase BNF’s capital adequacy ratio to 10 percent by December 2006
was achieved. We will continue strengthening BNF’s management to ensure that the
bank remains viable over the medium-term.

•

Additional efforts will be required to restructure the bank. To consolidate BNF’s
financial position, and strengthen its lending policies, BNF will develop a strategy for
reducing its operating costs, increasing its asset recovery, improving its credit and
risk management practices, and enhancing its internal controls by end-June 2007
(structural benchmark).

18.
It is imperative to continue with the efforts to strengthen the financial position of
the Central Bank to enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy. We intend to announce
a strategy to strengthen the Central Bank’s balance sheet and a timetable for its
implementation by June 2007 (structural benchmark), the Ministry of Finance will prepare
and send legislation to Congress that reflects the budgetary implications of such strategy by
September 2007 (structural benchmark). We will continue requesting technical advice from
the IMF for this purpose.
19.
The development of capital markets will be necessary to foster domestic savings
and improve its allocation into productive investment projects. Capital markets are at an
early stage of development and serious efforts are needed for these markets to emerge. It will
require a number of legal changes as well as institutional development. The Ministry of
Finance, in coordination with the Central Bank, will design a strategy for the development of
capital markets by end-December 2007 (structural benchmark). The strategy will identify all
public obligations; aim to convert all non-marketable public obligations into marketable
securities; formulate a plan for improving the profile of domestic public debt; and revamp the

53
legal framework for government debt management and the development of the government
securities market. We will request technical assistance from the IMF for this purpose.
C. Pro-Growth Agenda
20.
Higher levels of foreign and domestic investment will require improvements in
the investment climate in the country. A better investment climate will lead to higher
investment and higher growth. Following the design of a master plan to help promote the
investment climate in September 2006, the Ministry of Industry will implement such plan by
end-September 2007 (structural benchmark).
21.
Improvements in the efficiency of public enterprises are necessary to provide
better public services and increase productivity economy-wide. Public enterprises cover a
wide range of economic activities and improvements in their performance are necessary for
the proper functioning of the economy. Following the design of result-oriented management
contracts for ANDE, COPACO, ESSAP, INC, and PETROPAR in December 2006, the
Public Enterprise Supervising Council will publish the assessment reports according to the
schedules defined in the contracts. It will also ensure that these performance contracts are
satisfactorily observed during the year with an assessment by end-December 2007 (structural
benchmark).
D. Social Safety Net
22.
While the conditional cash transfer program was implemented, its coverage
needs to be broadened to become an effective vehicle for poverty alleviation. Following
the successful introduction of this program to some 8,800 families living under extreme
poverty in 2006 (well above the program objective of 7,000 families, the challenge for 2007
is to strengthen the monitoring mechanisms and the required provision of health and
education services while at the same time increasing the number of families receiving these
transfers. Notwithstanding these logistic and budgetary challenges, the Ministry of Social
Action will aim at widening the coverage of this program to 15,000 families by endDecember 2007 (structural benchmark). We will request technical assistance from the IDB
for this purpose.
IV. OTHER
We will continue to seek resolution to the disputed claims, negotiating in good faith.
There are a number of existing claims in dispute, which we hope to resolve during the
program. We will do the same for any new disputed claims that may arise.

For the purposes of the program, the central administration (CA) includes the executive,
judicial and legislative branches. The overall balance of the CA will be measured and
monitored from the financing side, as equal to minus the net financing of the CA. The net
financing of the CA is defined as the sum of: (i) net external financing to the central
government; (ii) the change in net credit to the central government from the financial system,
excluding government bonds; (iii) the net issuance of government bonds; (iv) net financing
from all other sources to the government (consisting of any form of financing other than
government bonds) including by the private sector; (v) asset sales; (vi) the net change in
domestic floating debt (deuda flotante), as defined below; and (vii) the net change in external
arrears. Items denominated in foreign currency will be converted into guaraníes at the
average exchange rate for each month.
For the purposes of the program, any government bonds issued to (i) capitalize the central
bank, (ii) capitalize the Banco Nacional de Fomento (BNF), or (iii) finance the deposit
guarantee will not be included in the definition of fiscal deficit.
Net external financing is defined as central government’s foreign borrowing, including bonds
issued abroad, less amortization payments (including debt prepayments) of foreign debt. Net

57
credit from the financial system is defined as the change in net credit to government, as
reported in the monetary accounts of the BCP, excluding government bonds. Net change in
domestic floating debt is defined as the difference between accrued expenditure (gastos
obligados) and payments transferred (gastos transferidos). Net change in external arrears is
defined as the difference in the stock of arrears to external creditors during a period of
reference, as reported by the ministry of finance’s SIGADE system. Data will be provided to
the Fund by the ministry of finance with a lag of not more than three weeks past the test date.
The floor on the Cumulative Central Administration Overall Balance for 2007 will be
adjusted downward by the full amount of cumulative transfers and/or interest due on any
bonds issued during 2007 as part of the program to strengthen the financial position of the
Central Bank.

For the purposes of the program, the consolidated public sector comprises: (i) the nonfinancial public sector (NFPS) and (ii) the Central Bank of Paraguay (BCP).
The NFPS includes the CA as defined above, the social security institutes, the provincial
governments, autonomous decentralized agencies, and the nonfinancial public enterprises.2
Under the program, the consolidated public sector’s overall balance will be measured and
monitored as equal to minus the net financing of the NFPS, plus the operating balance of the
BCP. The net financing of the NFPS is defined as the sum of: (i) net external financing;
(ii) the change in net domestic credit to public sector from the financial system, excluding
government bonds; (iii) the net issuance of government bonds; and (v) other net financing of
the nonfinancial public sector by the private sector, including net increase in the stock of
domestic floating debt, external arrears, and asset sales. Items denominated in foreign
currency will be converted into guaraníes at the average exchange rate for each month.
Net external financing of the NFPS is defined as all external disbursements less amortization
paid by the NFPS as defined above. The change in net credit is defined as the net flow of
gross domestic credit (excluding treasury bonds) plus use of deposits by the NFPS in the
domestic financial system. Domestic floating debt of the NFPS is defined as the difference
between accrued expenditure (gastos obligados) and payments transferred (gastos
transferidos) vis-à-vis the private sector. It will be measured as the central government
2

Altogether they include: Pension funds (Instituto de Previsión Social (IPS), Caja Bancaria, Caja Ande, Caja
Ferroviaria, Caja de Empleados Municipales), the public universities (UNA, UNE, UNP, UNI), 17 provinces
(gobiernos departamentales), 17 autonomous regulatory and development agencies, the public enterprises
(PETROPAR, ANDE, ANNP, DINAC, and INC) and incorporated enterprises owned by the state (ESSAP and
COPACO).

floating debt net of debts with the rest of the NFPS as defined herein. External arrears are
defined as the sun of (i) any principal and interest accrued by the NFPS and not paid by the
due date as reported by the ministry of finance’s SIGADE; (ii) the net change in arrears to
foreign suppliers of the NFPS. The operating balance of the BCP is measured as all
administrative and financial revenues minus costs (including costs of monetary policy and
interest on BCP external debt). Data will be provided to the Fund by the ministry of finance
and the central bank with a lag of not more than three weeks past the test date.

For monitoring purposes, net international reserves (NIR) of the BCP are defined as the U.S.
dollar value of gross foreign assets in foreign currencies minus gross liabilities in foreign
currencies with original maturity of less than one year. Data will be provided by the BCP to
the Fund with a lag of not more than five days past the test date.
Gross foreign assets are defined consistent with SDDS and include all liquid foreign
currency-denominated claims of BCP, including monetary gold, holdings of SDRs, the
reserve position in the IMF, and foreign currency in the form of cash, deposits abroad, and
Paraguay’s net cash balance within the Latin America Trade Clearing System (ALADI).
Excluded from gross foreign assets are participations in international financial institutions
(including Corporación Andina de Fomento (CAF), IDB, IBRD, Asociación Internacional de
Fomento, and Banco de Desarrollo del Caribe), the holdings of nonconvertible currencies,
and holdings of precious metals other than gold. Gross foreign liabilities are all foreign
currency denominated BCP liabilities of contracted maturity up to and including one year
plus the use of Fund credit. Non-U.S. dollar denominated foreign assets and liabilities will be
converted into U.S. dollars at the market exchange rates of the respective currencies as of
December 31, 2006.

60
NIR targets will be adjusted upward (downward) for any increase (decrease) in reserve
requirement deposits (encaje) associated with foreign currency deposits in commercial
banks, compared to the following levels: June 30, 2007: US$292 million; September 30,
2007: US$306 million; and December 31, 2007: US$303 million.
NIR targets will also be adjusted upward (downward) by the surplus (shortfall) in program
disbursements relative to the baseline projection. Program disbursements are defined as
uncommitted external disbursements that are usable for the financing of the overall central
government budget.

For the purpose of NDA calculation, NIR will be converted into guaraníes at an accounting
exchange rate of G 5,100/US$. The ceiling on NDA will be adjusted upward (downward) by
the equivalent in guaraníes of the downward (upward) adjustments made to the floor on the
NIR of the BCP as described above.
NDA targets will also be adjusted downward (upward) by the surplus (shortfall) in program
disbursements relative to the baseline projection. Program disbursements are defined as
uncommitted external disbursements that are usable for the financing of the overall central
government budget.

The limit applies to the contracting or guaranteeing by the public sector within the calendar
year of new nonconcessional external debt with an original maturity of more than one year,
including commitments contracted or guaranteed.4 For program purposes, a debt is
concessional if it includes a grant element of at least 35 percent on the basis of currencyspecific discount rates based on the OECD commercial interest reference rates (CIRR).5
3

The stock of debt does not include disputed claims to the following parties: Belgium’s Ex-Herstal, a South
African supplier; French and Swiss import verification companies; the National Bank of Argentina, and a
syndicate of European and American banks following a Swiss court ruling against Paraguay in May 2005. Any
of these claims that would be considered as debt will be added to the stock figure.

4

The term “debt” has the meaning set forth in point No. 9 of the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with
respect to Foreign Debt adopted on August 24, 2000 (Board Decision No. 12274-(00/85). In line with
Paraguayan law, debt will be deemed contracted only if it has received approval by Congress.

5

The grant element is calculated as the difference between the net present value (NPV) of debt and its nominal
value, expressed as a percentage of the nominal value of the debt (i.e., Grant Element = (Nominal Value –
(continued)

62
Excluded from the limits are credits extended by the IMF and balance of payments support
loans extended by multilateral and bilateral creditors. The Ministry of Finance will provide
data to the Fund with a lag of not more than 30 days from the test date.
The concessionality of loans in currency baskets will be assessed on the basis of U.S. dollar
interest rate tables. For loans with interest rates based on the internal policy of the creditors,
the relevant interest rate to define concessionality will be the interest rate for each creditor at
the time of the commitment. Loans or portions of loans extended in the context of a debt
rescheduling or a debt reduction operation will be excluded from the ceiling.
47.
Performance Criterion on Short-Term External Debt of the Nonfinancial Public
Sector
As a continuous performance criterion, the NFPS will neither contract nor guarantee any
short-term external debt during the program period. Short-term debt is defined as debt with a
contractual maturity of one year or less. Excluded are normal import-related credits, forward
contracts, swaps, and other futures market contracts. The public enterprises will provide the
necessary information to the ministry of finance, which will provide the data to the Fund,
with a lag of not more than 30 days from the test date.
48.

Performance Criteria on External Payments Arrears of the Public Sector

The Public Sector, excluding PETROPAR, will accumulate no new external arrears
during the program period. The stock of external arrears of the PS will be calculated based
on the schedule of external payments obligations reported by SIGADE. Data on external
arrears will be reconciled with the relevant creditors, and any necessary adjustments will be
incorporated in these targets as they occur. For the purposes of this performance criterion, an
arrear will be defined as a payment, which has not been made within 30 days after falling
due. In addition, the public enterprises will report to the Ministry of Finance and the BCP
arrears on any external debt that is not recorded under SIGADE. The same 30-day grace
period will be applied to all external payments of public enterprises, except where explicit
agreements exist with creditors on an extended grace period. The Ministry of Finance will
provide the final data on the stock of public sector external arrears to the Fund, with a lag of
not more than 30 days from the test date.
In addition, the government is engaged in good faith efforts to resolve overdue claims in
dispute, and will attempt to negotiate and resolve these as soon as possible. Claims against

NPV) / Nominal Value). The NPV of debt is calculated by discounting the future element stream of payments
of debt service due on this debt. For debt with a maturity of at least 15 years, the ten-year average CIRR will be
used to calculate the NPV of debt. For debt with a maturity of less than 15 years, the six-month average CIRR
will be used. For the purposes of the program, the CIRRs published by the OECD in December 2006 will be
used.

63
the state of Paraguay resulting from a judgment made by the Swiss Federal Supreme Court
on May 31, 2005, will be considered claims in dispute.
D. Reporting
Monitoring the program requires accurate and timely data. All information on performance
criteria, indicative targets, and balance of payments support loans will be reported to Fund
staff within the timeframes prescribed above. Debt stocks and associated flows broken down
by both creditor and debtor types and maturity will be provided on a quarterly basis.
The Ministry of Finance will be responsible for gathering data on a monthly basis from all
the institutions that comprise the consolidated public sector, including the incorporated
enterprises (Sociedades Anónimas) COPACO and ESSAP. It will compile this information
according to the standard format of the Ministry of Finance’s monthly financial situation
report (Situación Financiera). The data will be supplied to the Fund and published on the
Ministry of Finance’s external website within 30 days of each test date.

APPENDIX 4. PARAGUAY—FINANCIAL SECTOR ISSUES
I. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
1.
The financial system in Paraguay is recovering from a period of financial
distress. The regained macroeconomic stability provided a favorable environment for the
recovery of financial intermediation and a gradual increase in the private credit-to-GDP ratio
which had fallen significantly following the last financial crisis.
2.
Dollarization declined as stabilization took hold and confidence was recovered.
The share of both assets and liabilities in foreign currency reached over 60 percent of the
total in 2001 and dropped to around 50 percent in 2006. In addition, the average maturity of
both assets and liabilities has started to lengthen gradually, reflecting an increased confidence
in the financial system.
3.
The soundness of the banking system has steadily improved. Capitalization
ratios—capital over risk weighted assets—remain
Credit to the Private Sector (% of GDP)
comfortable at around 20 percent, well above the
24
10 percent regulatory minimum. At the same

2006

4.
However, the soundness of the system may be overstated by weak prudential
standards. Regulations on loans classification, provisioning requirements, and collateral use
need to be improved.1 The superintendence of banks (SB) needs to enhance its autonomy and
resources to perform its duties adequately. The laws and regulations need to be strengthened
for the proper supervisory oversight of bank policies, procedures and credit risk management
practices. Overall, the level of compliance of Paraguay with Basel Core Principles for
Effective Banking Supervision (BCPEBSs) is relatively low.2

1

Paraguayan standards do not distinguish between tier 1 and tier 2 capital; there are no requirements for market
risks; and weights for risky assets are low.

2

A regulation on loans classification and provisioning, known as “Resolución 8/03” was expected to enter into
effect in January 2007 but was delayed until August 2008 due to pressures from vested interest. The resolution
tightens arrears periods applied for each risk category, requires provisioning and information from borrowers,
and limits the use of collateral. The authorities report that all banks and virtually all finance companies are in
line with Resolución 8.

65
II. ADVANCES SINCE THE 2005 FSAP
5.
Although the condition of the banking system has improved, significant
challenges remain. Since the time of the FSAP, progress has been made in implementing the
reforms needed to enhance the resiliency of the system, and to foster financial
intermediation. Similarly, the public bank BNF has successfully recovered. However,
progress in other reform areas has been limited.
6.
The National Development Bank (BNF) regained its solvency. Riddled with
nonperforming loans, BNF was insolvent after the 2002 crisis. However, the situation
improved dramatically in the last two years. While the CAR was negative at end-2004, it
improved to 18½ percent by end-December 2006, eliminating the systemic risk generated by
BNF in the past. Efforts should now concentrate on a medium-term strategy to restructure the
bank. BNF’s management is currently working on the design of such a strategy.
7.
The legal and regulatory framework for banking supervision and financial
intermediation needs to be brought in line with international standards. This is
particularly important after the delay in the introduction of Resolución 8 to January 2008.

Source: Fund staff estimates.

9.
Capital markets remain thin and underdeveloped. Activity is limited and market
capitalization, at around US$200 million (3 percent of GDP), is low. The main constraints
are related to the high degree of informality of firms and to legal and infrastructure issues.
Progress in this area has been limited. A draft law of security deposits is being considered by

66
the authorities. Developing a market for government bonds in the context of a debt
management strategy would help in the development of capital markets. A draft law on bond
issuance is also being considered by the authorities.
10.
Financial cooperatives are steadily increasing their participation in the financial
system, accounting for about 25 percent of the market. Until 2004 cooperatives were
largely unregulated, but advances have been made with the formalization of the role of
INCOOP, and with regulations that defined their scope and established basic solvency, assets
classification, and provisioning criteria. However, an effective supervisory framework is still
absent. INCOOP has started consolidating financial information of the largest cooperatives
and is designing, in cooperation with the IADB, a supervisory framework, a depositinsurance-type of fund, and a credit registry. Improving the quality of information provided
by the sector remains a priority not only for supervisory purposes but also for the adequate
measurement and control of monetary aggregates. Efforts should focus on the largest
cooperatives at the initial stage.
III. PARAGUAY AND ITS PEERS: SUPERVISION, INSTITUTIONS AND INFORMATION
11.
Paraguay’s financial development compares unfavorably to its peers in the
region. Paraguay needs to implement a comprehensive strategy to bolster the performance of
the financial system, including

12.
The level of compliance with the Basel’s Core Principles for Effective Banking
Supervision is relatively low. Paraguay’s regulation and supervision compare less favorably
to other countries in the region. Prudential regulations, requirements, banking supervision,
and powers of supervisors need strengthening.
13.
The legal framework needs to be strengthened to facilitate credit operations. The

IV. A QUICK STRESS TEST
15.
At the time of the 2005 FSAP, credit and exchange rate risks were the main
sources of potential instability for banks. Stress tests suggested that the main risks faced
by banks were credit risks derived from a slowdown of economic activity, and exchange rate
risks; while interest rate risk was more limited. In 2005, a depreciation of 20 percent and a
slowdown in economic activity (to zero percent growth in real GDP) would reduce the
capital adequacy ratio of the system from 20 to 17–18 percent.3
16.
The system appears more resilient
nowadays. The system is still more
sensitive to shocks to the exchange rate and
to the economic activity than to the interest
rate; however, the negative effects are
somewhat more limited. For example, the
same exchange rate shock would reduce the
CAR from 21 to 19 percent. The higher
resilience may be the result of lower
dollarization, and improvements in the
maturity profile.4 Also, as mentioned above,
another positive factor may be that banks
have been applying a better risk-assessment
framework.

APPENDIX 5. PARAGUAY— DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
1.
Following the rapid decline in Paraguay’s debt-to-GDP ratio over the past five
years, it is projected to decline further under the baseline debt sustainability scenario.
Paraguay’s economic stabilization following the crisis in 2002 was accompanied by an
impressive reduction of the public debt burden from 71¾ percent of GDP to 27½ percent of
GDP at end-2006. Going forward, economic growth would average close to 5 percent a year
over the medium term with the overall position of the combined public sector in balance.
Under these assumptions, Paraguay’s public sector debt stock would decline further to about
22 percent of GDP by 2012.
2.
Given that 80 percent of total external debt is public, in the baseline scenario the
projected drop in public debt largely determines the path of Paraguay’s total external
debt. Private sector external debt is projected to increase slightly as direct investments by
foreign companies are also accompanied by some debt creating flows. Nevertheless, total
external debt is projected to decline from 33¾ percent of GDP at end-2006 to 29 percent
by 2012.
3.
Paraguay’s external and public sector debt ratios are robust to alternative
assumptions about underlying macroeconomic variables. Sensitivity tests based on
10-year historical standard deviations to form alternative medium-term assumptions for real
GDP growth and interest rates show that Paraguay’s debt dynamics are only moderately
vulnerable to such changes. For example, a 1¼ percent decline on average of annual growth
over the medium term would imply an increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio of 2 percent of
external debt and 8 percent of public debt by 2012.
4.
By contrast, given the high foreign currency share of Paraguay’s debt the
projected debt path is rather sensitive to exchange rate changes. Specifically, under a one
time 30 percent depreciation of the guaraní in 2008, the external debt-to-GDP ratio would
shift by 11 percentage points above the baseline projections in the medium term. Non-interest
current account shocks (such as in the terms of trade) would have a moderate adverse impact
on external indebtedness.
5.
A similar pattern is observed under a 10 percent of GDP shock to contingent
liabilities of the public sector. The public debt-to-GDP ratio would rise sharply in the short
run and, while declining over the medium term, would remain 10 percentage points above the
debt levels projected under the baseline scenario.

1/ Debt ratios refer to the nonfinancial public sector, excluding debt of the central bank and other financial public entities. For estimates only gross debt is used. Debt-to-GDP ratios are based on external debt being conver
into local currency on basis of end-period exchange rates divided by nominal local currency GDP.
2/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt;
and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.

APPENDIX 6. PARAGUAY—TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM
1.
The technical assistance (TA) program for Paraguay has been designed in close
collaboration with functional departments to support the main objectives of the SBA
program. Accordingly, the Fund TA strategy will concentrate on supporting reforms in the
following policy pillars of the program: (i) public sector reform; (ii) financial sector reform;
(iii) a pro-growth reform agenda; and (iv) a social safety net. Fund TA in the area of statistics
will support Paraguay’s objective of meeting international statistical standards. In all these
areas, technical assistance has been planned to support the authorities’ efforts preceding the
adoption of key structural measures.
2.
Public sector reform. This is needed to address remaining fiscal vulnerabilities and
rigidities, including institutionalizing the improvement in revenue collection, improving
budgetary planning and expenditure control.
3.
Financial sector reform. This key reform area includes strengthening the
functioning of the commercial banks, the Central Bank, public banks, and financial
cooperatives to reduce vulnerabilities in the system.
4.
Pro-growth reform agenda. In the first year, the program will focus on restructuring
public enterprises and in steps to improve investment climate. The World Bank and IDB are
assisting the authorities in these efforts.
5.
Social safety net. This reform pillar is needed to protect the most vulnerable
segments of society and to alleviate poverty. Following the successful introduction of this
program to 8,800 families living under extreme poverty in 2006, the challenge for 2007 is to
strengthen the monitoring mechanisms and the required provision of health and education
services while at the same time increasing the number of families receiving these transfers.
The IDB is expected to provide TA for this purpose.
6.
Statistics. The Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC 2006)
mission found that there is a need for improvements in almost all sectoral statistics. To
address most of these weaknesses, TA would need to be programmed.
7.
Schedule. The following Table presents detailed TA needs and the planned schedules
for TA provision.

APPENDIX 7. PARAGUAY—RELATIONS WITH INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS
The full annexes are available as a separate document. They can be viewed in CyberDocs on
the Fund’s intranet and on the secure extranet for Executive Directors and member officials.
Fund Relations
Paraguay has no current outstanding debt to the Fund. The authorities have treated as
precautionary the previous SBA (which covered December 2003 to November 2005), and the
current SBA (which will cover May 2006 to August 2008). Paraguay’s exchange rate regime
is a managed float, the exchange rate is determined in the inter-bank foreign exchange
market, with occasional Central Bank interventions to smooth out seasonal fluctuations. The
Central Bank is implementing proposed measures to address the vulnerabilities identified in
the Safeguards Assessment completed in October 2006. The last article IV consultation was
concluded by the Executive Board on July 30, 2004.
Relations with the World Bank Group1
The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) was approved in December 2003. The Bank’s
involvement aims at restoring confidence in the economy and to support reforms in financial
sector, rural development, health and education. As of December 2006, the Bank’s loan
commitments amount to US$169 million, of which US$124 million remain undisbursed. In
addition, the Bank is also involved in technical cooperation projects for US$5 million.
Relations with the Inter-American Development Bank2
A review of the IDB’s Country Strategy was approved in November 2006. The main focus of
the IDB’s activities for 2007-08 will be support to economic growth and poverty alleviation.
As of December 31, 2006, the IDB’s active loan portfolio amounts to US$739 million, of
which US$445 million is undisbursed, in part because of delays in Congress. The IDB is also
involved in technical cooperation operations for US$22 million.
Statistical Issues
While data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance and program purposes, it is
necessary to improve the timeliness and accuracy of macroeconomic statistics. Paraguay is a
participant of the General Data Dissemination System since 2001. A ROSC data module was
completed in June 2006 and identified a number of shortcomings in the coverage and
methodological soundness of national accounts and government statistics. Money, banking,
and balance of payments statistics are broadly reliable, but the other depository corporations
survey should be expanded to include also the largest credit unions.

VII. Exchange Rate Arrangement: The currency of Paraguay is the Paraguayan guaraní.
The exchange rate regime is a managed float. The exchange rate is determined in the
interbank foreign exchange market, but the central bank intervenes in the foreign exchange
and monetary markets to smooth out exchange rate fluctuations in real effective terms. The
U.S. dollar is the principal intervention currency. On April 30, 2007, the average interbank
rate for the U.S. dollar was G5,115

ANNEX 2. PARAGUAY—WORLD BANK RELATIONS1
(As of June 6, 2007)
The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) was approved on December 16, 2003, aiming at
restoring confidence in the economy and to support reforms in areas, such as the financial
sector, rural development, health, and education. At the moment the portfolio of the Bank
consist of three operations, of which two are projects under implementation:
•

Pilot Community Development ($9m, approved in FY00); and

•

Secondary Education Reform ($24m, approved in FY02).

And one project awaiting Parliament approval:
•

Road Maintenance Project ($74m, approved on August 24, 2006)

The three World Bank-financed projects presently under implementation or awaiting
ratification by parliament have a total value of US$107 million in commitments, of which
US$90 million remain undisbursed as of June 6, 2007.
In addition to loans, the Bank has mobilized grants for the institutional strengthening of
Congress ($0.4m) and the Ministry of Finance ($0.3m); to improve management of
indigenous lands ($1.7m); to support social development ($0.9m); and to improve
biodiversity and forestry ($0.3m from the Institutional Development Fund, and $0.3m and
$0.9m from the Global Environment Fund).
On the analytical, in FY07 the Bank has recently completed a Land Tax Study, and is
preparing an Integrated Fiduciary Framework (jointly with the Interamerican Development
Bank) and Education Attainment Assessment.
Projects under preparation include an additional financing for the Pilot Community
Development Project, a Sustainable Rural Investment project, a Modernization of the Water
Sector project, a Private Sector Development project, and a Forestry Project.

ANNEX 4. PARAGUAY: STATISTICAL ISSUES
While data provision is broadly adequate for program purposes, there is a need to improve
the timeliness and accurate reporting of statistics. Paraguay became a GDDS participant in
September 2001 with the publication of its metadata on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards
Bulletin Board (DSBB). A data ROSC mission visited Paraguay in January–February 2006;
the authorities’ response to the report and the mission’s recommendations are published on
the Fund’s website.
A. Real Sector
A new national accounts series—broadly consistent with the guidelines of the 1993 SNA—
was released in 2005. It was prepared with the assistance of an expert financed by the IDB
and comprises a more complete coverage of industries, an input-output matrix, and expanded
data sources for the compilation of the new base year (1994). However, no comprehensive
regular program for data collection of economic censuses and surveys exists (an industrial
survey was conducted in 2002) and source data for nonfinancial services, household
consumption, and changes in inventories are insufficient. Major areas of concern include:
(i) the 1994 reference year is becoming obsolete; (ii) excessive use is made of fixed
coefficients for value added and household consumption; (iii) changes in inventories are
obtained residually; (iv) informal activities are not monitored; and (v) supply and use tables
have been compiled only until 1997 while the periodicity of annual GDP meets GDDS
recommendations, timeliness does not because data are disseminated with a lag of
11 months.
Both the consumer (CPI) and producer price indices (PPI) are reported on a regular and
timely basis. The geographic coverage of the CPI is limited to Asunción (the capital) and
expenditure weights are representative of the consumption patterns of urban households. The
CPI has a base weight period of 1992, and the PPI of December 1995. The household budget
survey 2005–2006, for which information is now being gathered, will be used as the basis for
updating the CPI basket and weights and for developing the index in accordance with the
classification and valuation systems established in 1993 SNA. The PPI basket (150 items) is
still not fully representative of current national output; electricity, water, gas, and services are
not covered by the PPI.
Since the introduction of a regular household survey in 1998, the coverage and quality of
employment and unemployment statistics have improved significantly. However, frequencies
remain at the annual level, and the publication lag is close to one year. Wage indices are
updated twice a year.
The data ROSC mission found that the resources are insufficient for real sector statistics and
constrain further development, particularly the full adoption of the 1993 SNA.

84
B. Fiscal Sector
Paraguay’s GFS are broadly consistent with the recommendations of the Manual on
Government Finance Statistics 1986 (GFSM 1986). The authorities have not yet prepared a
plan to migrate to the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001). Monthly
data are available for the central administration (budgetary central government). Data on the
operations of the local governments are not included in the GFS. The asset position of the
social security system is available on a daily basis. Statistics on the central administration
include data of the Postal Service Directorate (a nonfinancial public corporation) and the
statistics of the nonfinancial public sector include data of financial public corporations (four
employer social insurance schemes). These social insurance schemes are treated as financial
corporations in the monetary and financial accounts. Data on medium- and long-term
external debt are reliable and available on a monthly basis. Domestic debt data are available
on request, but need to be fully integrated with the external debt database. Deficiencies
remain in the registration of short-term supplier and commercial credit of the public sector.
Moreover, there is a discrepancy in the fiscal data reported by the monetary and fiscal
authorities. Measures are being taken to make reporting more transparent.
Annual data covering only budgetary central government through 2005 have been reported
for publication in the 2006 edition of the GFS Yearbook. However, since 1994 no outstanding
debt data and no breakdowns for expenditure by function data have been provided for
publication in the GFS Yearbook. Monthly and quarterly data are not reported for publication
in IFS. The resumption of reporting of quarterly and monthly data for the IFS is highly
recommended.
C. Money and Banking Sectors
Money and banking statistics are broadly reliable because of the adoption of a new
accounting plan for commercial banks and finance companies in 1995. Following the work
on methodologies initiated in the 2000 STA mission, Paraguay completed the establishment
of a unified compilation and reporting system for the whole range of monetary data. This
new system intends to harmonize monetary data for use within the CBP, for reporting to STA
for publication in IFS, and for operational and monitoring purposes. A revision of the
classification criteria has led also to a marked reduction in the discrepancies of interbank
positions. However, the lack of coverage of the credit cooperatives remains a matter of
concern, since they account for around 25 percent of deposits and loans of the banking
sector.
The superintendency of banks publishes a detailed and informative report on the soundness
of the financial system. The authorities of Paraguay commenced submission of monetary
statistics based on standardized report forms.

85
D. External Sector
Quarterly and annual data on balance of payments and the international investment position
(IIP) are available from 2001 onwards on the central bank website, and are reported to STA.
Annual IIP data have been compiled and disseminated for the period 1995–2005 (quarterly
data for the period Q12001–Q12006). The classification of the balance of payments and the
IIP follows the recommendations of the Balance of Payments Manual, 5th edition.
Improvements have been made in the quality of the data on capital flows, especially in the
coverage of foreign direct investment, and in the recording of external debt transactions in
the balance of payments and in the IIP. The central bank now produces a highly informative
bulletin with balance of payments statistics. Special studies by the central bank have
improved the estimation methods for remittances of Paraguayans abroad and unregistered
trade transactions, but serious deficiencies remain.
Also, deficiencies remain in the area of private capital outflows, which are difficult to
register due to Paraguay’s open capital account. Major recommendations of the 2006 data
ROSC mission include the need to: (i) design and conduct sample surveys to capture data for
items currently excluded from balance of payments statistics or items not appropriately
covered (e.g., some services, direct and portfolio investment abroad, real estate); (ii) review
and update the statistical techniques to estimate unrecorded trade; (iii) prepare periodical
reports to inform management of the CBP of the quality of survey’s data (response, coverage,
response errors); and (iv) initiate a process of quarterly reconciliation of flows and stocks of
medium- and long-term external public debt with the MOF.
A follow up technical assistance mission on balance of payments statistics visited the BCP in
November 2006. The main objective of the mission was to assist the BCP in implementing
recommendations of the ROSC mission. In particular, the follow up mission focused on:

IMF Executive Board Completes Second and Third Reviews under Paraguay’s
Stand-By Arrangement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) completed on June 29, 2007,
the second and third reviews of Paraguay’s economic performance under a 27-month StandBy Arrangement in the amount equivalent to SDR 65 million (about US$98.4 million). This
will make SDR 43 million (about US$65 million) available to Paraguay immediately.
However, the Paraguayan authorities intend to continue treating the arrangement as
precautionary. The arrangement was approved May 31, 2006 (see Press Release No. 06/117).
The main objectives of the program are to raise growth on a sustainable basis and to address
widespread poverty. The program is centered around five reform areas: strengthening
macroeconomic management, reinforcing fiscal institutions, tackling financial weaknesses,
developing a pro-growth policy agenda, and designing an effective poverty reduction policy.
The Executive Board also concluded the Article IV Consultation with Paraguay.
Following the Board discussion on the second and third reviews, Takatoshi Kato, Deputy
Managing Director and Acting Chair, said:
“Paraguay’s economic performance over the past four years has been commendably strong,
reversing decades of declining living standards. Since 2003, growth has rebounded to almost
twice its long-term average, and extreme poverty has been reduced by almost one-third. The
consolidated public debt-to-GDP ratio has been reduced by one half, inflation has been
contained, the guaraní has strengthened significantly, and international reserves have reached
a historical peak. This progress is the result in large part of the government’s determined
efforts to establish fiscal and monetary discipline and entrench structural reforms.
“Performance under the Fund-supported program has been good. In particular, fiscal
discipline was maintained despite rising expenditure pressures toward the end of 2006.
Following supply shocks during the fourth quarter of 2006, inflation increased significantly,
but there has been a substantial reduction in inflation since the beginning of this year. The

2

outlook for economic activity in 2007 remains robust, with real GDP growth projected at 4-5
percent. However, there have been some delays in implementing financial sector reforms.
In their medium-term strategy, the authorities are committed to entrenching macroeconomic
stability, intensifying reforms to establish the conditions for sustained growth, and addressing
remaining vulnerabilities in the financial sector. The authorities’ policies will be aimed at
creating an enabling environment for private sector-led growth and achieving a meaningful
reduction in poverty.
“Going forward, there is a need for the authorities to implement without delay their new plan
to strengthen the financial system. The current high profits and declining level of
nonperforming loans in the financial system suggest that now would be a good opportunity
for the authorities to improve the financial sector’s regulatory and supervisory frameworks
and the central bank’s financial position.
“The Fund, through policy advice and technical assistance, will continue supporting the
authorities in their efforts to address these challenges,” Mr. Kato said.

Statement by Javier Silva-Ruete, Executive Director for Paraguay
and Luis Enrique Salgueiro, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
June 29, 2007
1.
Our Paraguayan authorities would like to thank the IMF staff for a well-written and
comprehensive report, which clearly highlights and evidences the authorities’ aim to pursue
their macroeconomic objectives. They would also like to express their firm commitment to
consolidating the stabilization efforts made so far and their intention to carry out their
remaining goals in macroeconomic sustainability, as well as the structural reform agenda in
order to ensure sustainable growth.
Recent Economic Developments
2.
After the approval of the previous Stand-By Arrangement in 2003, the Paraguayan
economy has shown significant economic progress, which has been broadly satisfactory and
paved the way for further macroeconomic achievements. In particular, we concur with the
staff’s view that macroeconomic outcomes have been underpinned by a disciplined and
coordinated fiscal and monetary policy. Consequently, the most important results were a near
doubling of the long-term average real GDP growth after the 2002 financial crisis and the
reduced level of extreme poverty. In fact, the estimated GDP growth was around 4 percent in
2006, which was better than projected and mainly driven by a significant increase in services,
manufacturing, the agricultural sector—which is recovering after severe drought—, beef
exports, and private investment in telecommunications.
3.
Despite higher volatility in 2006, a prudent monetary policy allowed core inflation to
fall from 10 percent in 2005 to 7 percent in 2006, in line with the objective under the
program. Headline inflation increased from 10 percent in 2005 to 12½ percent in 2006 as a
result of supply shocks, namely stricter sanitary control in imported fruits and vegetables and
increased beef exports which pushed up domestic prices, leading to a 12-month rate of
7 percent in May 2007. Although the large foreign exchange inflows—and consequently the
necessary placements of Central Bank bills (LRM) to sterilize the foreign exchange excess in
2006 and the first five months of 2007—forced increases in the value of the currency, the
Central Bank was skillful in putting a stop to the rapid appreciation, while also containing
currency growth. In addition, the large foreign exchange inflow from royalties associated
with the two bi-national hydroelectric plants strengthened the external position and took the
Central Bank to a peak of international reserves, to US$ 2.1 billion by end-May 2007.
4.
On the fiscal front, prudent policies adopted in recent years reflected a stronger
financial level, as a result of improved tax collections and controlled current expenditure.
These were possible thanks to the implementation of a disciplined financial plan which
resulted in a primary surplus of 1½ percent of GDP in 2006. In this regard, the authorities
have prepared a tax procedure code which was approved by the economic cabinet in
December 2006. The financial plan not only put financial issues in order, but also helped to

2
regularize payments, eliminate arrears, and—its most important achievement—decrease the
public debt-to-GDP ratio from around 70 percent in 2002 to an estimated 27½ percent in
2006. Public enterprises have adhered to this effort by signing a results-oriented management
contract aimed to improve public services and financial ratios.
5.
In the context of improved and sustained macroeconomic stability, the financial
system, although in a smaller proportion, is recovering by restarting lending operations to the
private sector, which grew by 18 percent in 2006, as dollarization fell from 65 percent of
assets and liabilities in 2002 to almost 50 percent in 2006. Similarly, the banking system has
lengthened the maturity of assets and liabilities and strengthened their position, reaching a
capital adequacy ratio (CAR) of 20 percent, which is over the established minimum of
10 percent. The National Development Bank (BNF) has also regained its solvency over a
short period, reaching a CAR under the IMF standard of 8½ percent in June 2006 (against a
5 percent target) and 18½ percent in December 2006 (against a 10 percent target) thanks to
higher asset recovery and undistributed profits.
6.
Regarding social reforms, the government has also reached significant achievements,
such as decreasing the overall poverty index from almost 50 percent of the population in
2002 to 40 percent in 2005. Social investments have also contributed to progress in
education, with illiteracy rates declining from 10 percent in 1995 to 4 percent in 2005.
Fiscal Policy
7.
The fiscal authorities are committed to maintaining macroeconomic stability as a way
to increase growth and reduce poverty. Along these lines, they are implementing several
measures aimed to strengthen fiscal sustainability. In the short term, they are putting in
practice a financial plan approved in March 2007 aimed to achieve a broader fiscal balance
for 2007 by restraining current expenditure, while giving further opportunity for capital
spending.
8.
In the medium term, the authorities are cognizant of the need to improve fiscal policy
flexibility and fiscal institutions, as well as promoting fiscal sustainability to facilitate their
goal of achieving long-term growth and poverty alleviation through better social spending
and infrastructure investment. In this regard, an agreement has been reached and several
reforms are on track, such as enhancing the institutional framework of tax and customs
administration to consolidate recent revenue gains. In fact, the strategy pursued by the
government is to gradually increase the tax base and enhance administrative tax efficiency to
enhance the tax-to-GDP ratio. In addition, strengthening public financial management to
improve expenditure efficiency and control, reducing budget rigidities to allow further
flexibility, rationalizing the civil service to improve service delivery; and reforming the
pension regime to increase coverage and secure financial, complement the strategy.
9.
In line with the identified weaknesses, the authorities have already drafted a tax
procedures code and the implementing regulations are being prepared. In the same vein, in

3
order to address current rigidities, improve control, rationalize expenditure and budgetary
processes, and incorporate macroeconomic constraints, the Ministry of Finance will design
an expenditure control system at the Central Government level, which will improve
efficiency and quality in spending, as well as strengthening public financial management.
Consistent with this purpose, the reduction in the number of accounts to a single one is
currently in process, for which further assistance from the IMF is being requested. In this
regard, in order to increase efficiency and priorities in capital expenditure, a public sector
investment system will be designed with assistance from the IADB. Likewise, to complement
the measures adopted in the past, an action plan aimed to ensure long-term solvency in
pension systems will be developed.
10.
In the same vein, public enterprises are following a management program based on
results, and scheduled ratios by contract will be published by the Public Enterprises
Supervising Council. This program plays an important role not only to contribute to
providing better services, but also to set a productivity benchmark for the economy as a
whole.
11.
Turning to the funds budgeted in social investments, the government increased the
budget by 12¾ percent by May 2007, which currently represents 46.7 percent of total public
spending. In addition, there was an increase of 18.3 percent in the health sector, and also an
increase of 8.2 percent in education. Given the important role that public investment and
poverty alleviation programs play in the government agenda, and as long as macroeconomic
conditions allow absorption, higher-than-targeted levels of capital and targeted social
expenditures will be supported.
12.
As mentioned previously, one important achievement was the decrease in the public
debt-to-GDP ratio, which reached 71¾ percent in 2002, mainly because of the large fiscal
imbalances at that time and a depreciated currency which increased the burden of the debt.
After an adequate fiscal adjustment effort, payments and arrears were regularized and the
public debt burden was reduced to GDP to 27½ percent in 2006. The government has stated
that additional debt would be considered only in very favourable conditions.
13.
With the objective to preserve stability in an intensive and important electoral
moment for democratic consolidation, the fiscal and monetary authorities have launched an
accord to which all socio-economic sectors are committed to contributing to guarantee a
smooth transition and deliver to the next government (2008) a country with stronger
institutions, less poverty, and a more stable economy in a context of a sustainable growth. A
low and controlled inflation is a public good that affects the whole population. Therefore,
coordination between fiscal and monetary policy will be the key purpose of this agreement.
Monetary Policy
14.
The monetary authorities’ key objective is to reach a core inflation of 5 percent by
limiting currency growth to 12 percent, while maintaining control on net domestic assets

4
around 20 percent by placements of LRM and holding an accumulation of 33 percent of
currency in international reserves. Although core inflation was 7 percent at end-2006 and the
12-month rate of inflation fell to around 6 percent in April 2007, which is very auspicious,
the monetary authorities think that it would be more prudent to establish a range between
2½ and 7½ percent for 2007. Consistent with this objective and with an expected growth rate
of 4-5 percent, as well as a moderate strengthening in real money demand, the Central Bank
will maintain a reasonable level of growth of monetary aggregates.
15.
During the first five months of 2007, Paraguay has experienced large inflows of
foreign exchange, mainly from the royalties of the two bi-national hydroelectric plants,
which has forced the Central Bank to make large purchases of foreign exchange in order to
avoid a sudden appreciation of the currency—which in turn forced an increase in its
placements of LRM to sterilize liquidity excess. Although the monetary authorities have
significantly reduced LRM interest rates to discourage further inflows, there is still interest in
these instruments, which indeed could facilitate the control of currency expansion by the
Central Bank in the near future, as monetary costs would be lower.
16.
Regarding the latter, it is important to mention that the monetary authorities are
addressing the negative income position of the Central Bank and are currently designing a
strategy to strengthen the financial position in coordination with the Ministry of Finance.
Although this structural reform has taken longer than envisaged, the authorities would like to
reiterate their commitment and the Ministry of Finance will prepare a legislation to send to
Congress with the legal and budgetary strategy by September 2007. The resulting law will
strengthen the Central Bank’s financial position and guarantee improved monetary policy.
17.
Although external vulnerabilities remain, the authorities are confident that the balance
of payments will be kept under control, since against the current account deficit, the capital
and financial account surplus in terms of GDP has more than doubled in 2006 and is
projected to continue in this line. At the same time, the expected level of net international
reserves is still strong, while the coverage remains around three months of imports. It is also
expected that exports will continue to perform well, thanks to gains in productivity, namely
beef and crops, especially soy, which is recovering after the drought.
Financial and Structural Reforms
18.
Turning to the financial sector, the BNF has recovered as CAR surpassed the
expected conditionality. In order to consolidate the BNF’s financial position gained so far,
the authorities intend to limit future political interference with the banks’ lending policies
and are developing a medium-term business strategy aimed to reduce operating costs,
increase asset recovery, improve credit and risk management practices, and enhance internal
controls.
19.
Having missed the structural benchmark on implementing regulatory measures, the
authorities have proposed three new supervision improvements. In this regard, the Central

5
Bank will reach a consensus with the banking community on a new version of resolution
8/03 to upgrade credit requirements, loan classification and provisioning. With assistance
from the IMF, the Central Bank will design an ambitious plan to address weaknesses in the
regulatory and supervisory frameworks of the banking system, which will aim to increase
observance to around 80 percent of the Basel Core Principles of Banking Supervision. In
addition, prudential regulations will be strengthened in critical supervising areas, such as
capital requirements calculation, better rules for provisioning, streamlining administrative
sanctions proceedings, rationalizing rules on open net foreign exchange positions and the
public reporting on the financial position of banks.
20.
An important and increasing portion of the financial system corresponds to
cooperatives. Therefore, to reduce vulnerabilities and regulatory differences with the rest of
the financial institutions, the supervisory institution INCOOP will develop an effective
supervisory and regulatory framework for financial issues and will also strengthen the
monitoring framework by compiling monetary statistics and its incorporation within the
Central Bank’s monetary statistics.
21.
In order to facilitate transactions and mobilize financial resources, as well as improve
the management of monetary policy and liquidity in the financial system, the Central Bank
will prepare a draft payments system law to be approved by the economic cabinet by endSeptember 2007. In addition, although capital markets are in the early stages and with the
intention to promote domestic savings and improve its allocation into productive investment
projects, the Ministry of Finance, in coordination with the Central Bank, will design a
strategy for the development of capital markets, which will consider legal and institutional
demands.
22.
Extreme poverty alleviation represents the authorities’ main concern. In this vein, a
cash transfer program to help families in extreme poverty has been implemented, which has
reached over 8,800 families, more than its first objective of 7,000 families. This program
primarily provides health and education services and the Ministry of Social Action,
responsible for this coverage, intends to broaden it to 15,000 families by December 2007.
23.
The authorities are committed to moving forward with structural reforms with the aim
of improving the business climate and promoting investment and growth. In this regard, the
government agrees with the staff that an improvement in the investment climate will lead to a
higher level of foreign and domestic investment; therefore, the Ministry of Industry would be
implementing a master plan created to promote investment by September of this year.
Closing Remarks
24.
Our authorities would like to thank the IMF for their support in consecutive programs
and for their invaluable efforts and insightful advice. These programs have allowed Paraguay
to set a firm commitment to crucial reforms. Most importantly, a solid and coordinated
economic policy framework was (and still is) fundamental for economic recovery and

6
poverty alleviation, while creating improved and favorable conditions through fiscal and
monetary sectors to enhance productivity. At this stage, Paraguay is still facing important
challenges that need to be addressed. However, the authorities are confident that cooperation
with the Fund will be crucial to fulfill these endeavors.

IMF Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with Paraguay
On June 29, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Paraguay. 1
Background
After a decade of stagnation and instability, and a quarter of a century of declining living
standards, Paraguay has experienced lately some of the best macroeconomic outcomes in
recent history. Following the 2002 financial crisis and the implementation of economic reforms
supported by the IMF under a Stand-By Arrangement approved in 2003 and renewed in 2006,
growth has rebounded to almost twice its long-term average, per capita income increased to
its highest level in 8 years, and the number of households living in extreme poverty was
reduced by almost one third.
The economy is coming out of a long period of stagnation, as real GDP remained at about the
same level during 1996-2002. The expansion that began in 2003 continued in 2006 with real
GDP growth rising to about 4 percent, and prospects for strong growth in 2007 are good. On
the supply side, growth was led by strong performances in services, stock farming and
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff
prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the
discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors,
and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive
Board as expressed during the June 29, 2007 Executive Board discussion based on the staff report.

2
manufacturing. At the same time agricultural output began to recover as the effects of the
previous years’ drought began to taper off. On the demand side, growth was driven by a
dynamic export sector, particularly beef, and a surge in private investment, especially in
telecommunications.
Efforts to reduce inflation continued in 2006 with mixed results. While underlying inflation
(excluding fruits and vegetables) was reduced from 10 percent in 2005 to 7 percent, headline
inflation increased to 12½ percent. This increase reflected stricter application of sanitary
controls on imports of vegetables, which reduced supplies and raised vegetable prices by
almost 100 percent, and Paraguay’s increased access to beef markets abroad, which pushed
domestic beef prices up by over 30 percent. Supply shocks unwound in the first five months of
2007, and the price level actually fell by about 1 percent. For the year as a whole inflation is
expected to decline to 5 percent.
Public finances have improved considerably in the last few years, mainly on account of higher
tax collections—supported by the 2004 tax reform—and efforts to rein in current spending.
Public finances recorded a small surplus in 2006 (0.1 percent of GDP). Tax collections
continued to be buoyant and current expenditures remained under control through the
implementation of a strict financial plan, the freezing new positions (other than for social
sectors), and the under-execution of capital expenditures.
The external position has been favorable in recent years, supported by a benign international
and regional environment, and a reflow of previous capital flight. This allowed the Central Bank
to triple its level of reserves over the last four years, to US$1.7 billion by end-2006, and a
35 percent strengthening of the guaraní against the U.S. dollar over the same period. During
2006, the external position improved significantly despite a deterioration of the current
account—due to a surge in import demand—as the capital account continued improving. The
external position strengthened further during the first part of 2007 and the level of reserves
exceeded US$2.0 billion at end-May.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal. They commended the
Paraguayan authorities for their continued implementation of sound macroeconomic policies,
which have contributed to a rebound of economic growth and an increase in per capita income
after a long period of stagnation. Prudent fiscal policies have put public debt on a sustainable
path, and the build-up of international reserves in the context of a strengthened currency has
enhanced Paraguay’s resilience to external shocks. Directors encouraged the authorities to
intensify reforms, especially in the financial sector, in order to entrench macroeconomic
stability and establish the conditions for sustained growth and poverty reduction.

3
Directors commended the authorities for their intention to achieve overall fiscal balance in
2007 and to implement the necessary budget cuts. Looking ahead, they stressed the need to
maintain fiscal discipline in the face of intensifying pressures during the upcoming pre-electoral
period. Directors underscored the importance of locking in last year’s improvements in tax and
customs administration and modernizing the tax code. They also saw a need for wage restraint
and public sector rationalization to make room for more public investment. A strengthening of
the budgetary framework would reduce the need to resort to financial plans, and would be a
more effective and transparent means of expenditure control.
Directors supported the authorities’ tight monetary policy stance, and encouraged them to
persevere with their efforts to further reduce inflation. They considered that the Central Bank of
Paraguay had struck a reasonable balance between accommodating currency appreciation
and accumulating international reserves in the context of the country’s floating exchange rate
regime. Given the recent volatility of inflation rates, it will, however, be important to monitor the
situation closely, and to respond promptly to any signs of underlying inflationary pressures or
potential monetary imbalances. Directors encouraged early progress on steps to strengthen
the financial position of the central bank.
Directors welcomed the improved soundness of Paraguay’s banking system and strengthened
confidence in the financial sector, as well as the decline in dollarization. Noting the setbacks
that had occurred in 2006, Directors welcomed the authorities’ renewed commitment to
reinvigorate the reform momentum in this important area, and encouraged them to persevere
with measures to strengthen commercial bank loan classification and provisioning
requirements. Other financial sector reform priorities in the period ahead should include the
development of a medium-term business plan for the publicly-owned development bank BNF,
the preparation of a draft for a new payment system law, the formulation of a strategy to
develop domestic capital markets, and the development of an effective supervisory and
regulatory framework for financial cooperatives. Directors welcomed the steps to enhance
compliance with the Basel Core Principles of banking supervision, and implement according to
plan the central bank’s prudential regulations.
Directors commended the authorities for taking a multi-pronged approach to structural reform,
which will remain key to enhancing productivity and achieving higher economic growth on a
sustainable basis. They encouraged them to maintain their commitment to implement the
ambitious structural reform agenda in 2007 and over the medium term.
Regarding public sector reform, Directors welcomed the authorities’ plans to draft
implementing regulations for the tax procedures code, develop an action plan for pension
reform, design a public investment system, and establish an expenditure control system at the
commitment level. Implementation of the authorities’ plan to improve the business climate will
enhance the prospects for high growth. Public enterprises will be strengthened and the
monitoring of their performance improved through the introduction of results-oriented contracts

4
for their management. Directors also looked forward to steps to buttress the social safety net
by broadening the coverage of the conditional cash transfer program and strengthening
program evaluation mechanisms.
