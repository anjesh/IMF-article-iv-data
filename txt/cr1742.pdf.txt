IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with Australia
On February 3, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
2016 Article IV consultation with Australia.1
Australia has enjoyed robust growth despite the commodity price and mining investment bust.
The moderate impact of the large shocks since 2011 highlights the resilience of the economy and
strong policy frameworks. From mid-2015, the recovery advanced with a marked pickup in
activity, although underlying demand growth remained close to trend. Nevertheless, Australia
has not been immune to some elements of the “new mediocre.” Wage and price pressures have
been weak, underemployment has risen, and private business investment outside mining has been
lackluster.
By some metrics, housing market conditions have cooled, in tandem with intensified prudential
and regulatory steps, but risks related to house price and debt levels remain. In the continued low
interest rate environment, house prices and household debt have risen further but house price
growth has moderated. Intrinsic housing market risks are localized. Bank lending to household
has slowed, especially in riskier loans, and banks have strengthened their balance sheets.
With inflation below the target range of 2-3 percent and a downshift in the path of inflation
expectation in 2016, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) lowered its policy rate by another
50 basis points to 1.5 percent. Core inflation has since stabilized at around 1.6 percent. Wage
growth has remained weak, with nominal unit labor costs running at less than 0.5 percent on
average, and cost pressures have been virtually absent suggesting that some economic slack is
still present.
The federal government has recently aimed for substantial near-term fiscal consolidation but
budget targets have not been met because of weaker nominal income. In the FY2016/17 budget,
the government has projected a return to fiscal balance by FY2020/21. It has renewed its
commitment to a federal government surplus of 1 percent of GDP over the business cycle as a
medium-term fiscal anchor, which would imply a cumulative adjustment of up to 3.4 percent of

GDP. The Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook 2016-17 (MYEFO) foresees a cumulative
adjustment of the fiscal balance of 2.1 percent of GDP by end of FY2019/20, primarily related to
stronger personal income tax collection due to bracket creep.
Recent structural reforms have focused on fostering innovation. The National Innovation and
Science Agenda (NISA) includes measures to boost innovation and entrepreneurship in the hightech sector, including through tax breaks. Legislation is being prepared for key components of
the Harper Review, which has identified a number of reforms to boost competition and
productivity in the services sectors, and to strengthen competition policy broadly.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors noted that Australia’s robust economic growth and low unemployment
during the current terms-of-trade adjustment reflect the resilience of the economy and strong
policy frameworks. While the balance of risks to the growth outlook has improved, there remain
significant risks and uncertainties, notably weaker-than-expected domestic consumption,
housing-related vulnerabilities, the rise in protectionist policies in the global economy, and a
significant slowdown in Australia’s main trading partners. Against this background, Directors
stressed the importance of maintaining supportive macroeconomic policies, addressing macrofinancial vulnerabilities, and boosting long-term potential growth.
Directors noted that continued demand support is needed to ensure a smooth transition to nonmining growth. They agreed that, with inflation below target, still elevated underemployment,
and remaining economic slack, the monetary policy stance should remain accommodative.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ readiness to ease monetary policy further if warranted, and
encouraged steps to improve policy communication.
Directors supported the government’s plans to balance its budget over four years and make its
expenditure composition more growth-friendly. Many Directors saw scope for using the
available fiscal space to support aggregate demand and structural fiscal reforms, as well as
increase infrastructure investment. Many other Directors viewed the authorities’ front-loaded
consolidation path as appropriately prudent under the current circumstances. Directors welcomed
the intention to take a flexible approach if large downside risks materialize, noting that
contingency plans would also be helpful. While the current medium-term fiscal framework has
served the economy well, Directors recommended that the authorities continue to consider
options to strengthen it further.
Directors commended the progress in enhancing prudential and regulatory measures to mitigate
risks associated with the housing market, and in improving AML/CFT safeguards in the real
estate sector. They encouraged the authorities to remain vigilant and continue to enhance the
resilience of the banking system to shocks with macro-financial implications, including by
encouraging banks to strengthen their capital position. Financial regulatory authorities would

need to stand ready to intensify targeted prudential measures, if lending or house price growth
were to re-accelerate, while advancing the implementation of the regulatory reform agenda.
Directors welcomed the government’s structural reform agenda to boost productivity through
fostering innovation and strengthening competition, especially in the services sector. They
commended the authorities for their commitment to an open economy in trade, foreign
investment, and immigration.

AUSTRALIA
STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
January 17, 2017

KEY ISSUES
Context. Australia has enjoyed a robust economic performance despite the commodity
price and mining investment bust. The moderate impact of the large shocks since 2011
reflects prompt monetary easing, a flexible exchange rate acting as a shock absorber,
export orientation to the dynamic Asia region, flexible labor markets, relatively high
population growth, and strong institutions. Nevertheless, Australia has also been
confronted with symptoms of the “new mediocre” since the Global Financial Crisis,
including a downshift in average GDP growth. And with declining interest rates, already
high house prices and household debt ratios have started to rise again.
Outlook and risks. After a slowdown due to one-off factors around mid- 2016, growth
close to trend is expected to resume from 2017 onwards, with increasing contributions
from so far lackluster private domestic demand. With a gradual return to full
employment, inflation is expected to edge back up within its 2-3 percent target range.
Macro-financial vulnerabilities are expected to stabilize as house prices align with
broader price levels. A hard landing in China is a major external risk, while housingrelated vulnerabilities remain the dominant domestic source of risk.
Policy recommendations. The policy priorities are to complete the transition to nonmining-based growth with adequate demand support amid mild symptoms of the “new
mediocre”, contain macro-financial risks, and upgrade the longer-term growth potential.


Demand support. Under the baseline, the priority is to maintain monetary
accommodation and to use Australia’s fiscal space for a gradual fiscal consolidation
while raising infrastructure spending and supporting structural reforms. If a large
downside shock were to materialize, fiscal stimulus may be needed to support
aggregate demand, considering that monetary policy could rapidly become
constrained by the effective lower bound on nominal policy rates.



Macro-financial policies. Policies should focus on further strengthening resilience
to housing and other shocks with macro-financial implications—by maintaining
robust bank capital positions, completing regulatory reform, and standing ready to
tighten prudential regulation should house prices increases re-accelerate.



Raising productivity. Reforms should focus on fostering innovation, raising
competition and productivity in the services sectors, and reforming the tax system.

Australia’s economic performance has been robust in comparison to other advanced
economies despite the commodity price and mining investment bust. Growth has remained
above 2 percent (annual rate) and increases in unemployment have been small. The moderate

continued uninterrupted for 25 years.

2.
Still, Australia has been confronted with symptoms of the “new mediocre.” The
economy has experienced a slowdown since the global financial crisis (GFC), with average GDP
growth about 0.8 percent lower (annual rate), which is indicative of lower potential output growth.
As elsewhere, the adjustment to the shocks has been drawn out, and growth has fallen short of
expectations in 2014 and early 2015, partly

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK AND RISKS
A. Developments over the Past Year
4.
Australia’s recovery advanced with a pickup in activity from mid-2015, but underlying
demand growth remained closer to trend. Growth (at annual rates) increased to over 3 percent
from mid-2015—above current potential output growth estimates of 2¾ percent—driven by higher
government spending, LNG export capacity coming on stream, strong services export growth, and
buoyant residential investment.1 That said, private business investment outside mining has remained
more subdued than expected. And with the growth rebalancing toward non-mining activity, activity
in states where such activity dominates has been buoyant, and disparities in economic performance
between non-mining and mining states have widened. With hindsight, some of the growth pickup in
early 2016 reflected one-off level increases in demand, particularly in government spending.
Consequently, real GDP unexpectedly contracted by 2 percent annualized in 2016Q3 when these
level effects wore off, with temporary, weatherState Final Demand

Background work for the 2015 Article IV consultation suggests that annual potential output growth in Australia has
declined from about 3¼ percent before the global financial crisis to about 2¾ percent in recent years. See

unemployment has decreased from its recent peak. Still, the underemployment rate—defined as the
share of employed persons in the labor force seeking to work more hours—has remained almost
2 percentage points above average (7 percent of the active labor force over the past 20 years). Some
80 percent of the jobs created over the past year or so have been part-time jobs.2 At the same time,
the share of long-term unemployment has remained above average. As of mid-2016, IMF Staff
estimates the output gap at 1.7 percent and the unemployment rate gap at 0.5 percent (about
1¼ percent at the peak).

Both headline and core inflation have been below the inflation target range of
2-3 percent in 2016, and the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) responded promptly to an
unexpected downshift in the inflation path. Initially, the disinflation that began in late 2014 had
been driven by the declines in the prices of oil and other commodities. Over the past 12 months,
however, the declines have been due to non-tradables inflation, with the RBA pointing to the
temporary inflation impact from lower margins due to increased competition in the retail and other
sectors. After a noticeable, unexpected decline of core inflation in the first quarter of 2016, and a
downshift in the path of expected inflation, the RBA has lowered the policy rate by another 50 basis
points to 1.5 percent in 2016 in May and August. Core inflation has since stabilized at around
1.6 percent. Wage growth has remained weak, with nominal unit labor costs running at less than
0.5 percent on average, and cost pressures have been virtually absent.
7.
The current account balance has remained moderately weaker than its fundamental
level and the Australian dollar has continued to be moderately overvalued. The commoditycurrency adjustment mechanism that has come into play after the mining investment bust has
supported the rebalancing of growth toward net exports, with investment weakness also weighing
on imports. A renewed widening of the current account deficit in 2015 reflected temporary factors,
including weather related export declines and exceptional imports, and the balance has since

narrowed again. While currency depreciation in 2014-15 has reduced much of the overvaluation that
had developed over the boom, the correction has stalled in recent months (Annex IV—External
Sector Assessment). The latter has likely reflected the relative attractiveness of Australian assets,
given their relatively high returns. Nonetheless, yields on longer-term Australian bonds have
declined, and valuation effects from the resulting bond price increases, together with exchange rate
appreciation, have contributed to a marked deterioration in the net external liability position over
the past year, given the economy’s sizeable net short position in that asset class (Annex II). That said,
the underlying risk profile has improved further, adding to improvements since the global financial
crisis, as the share of longer-term external funding of Australian banks has increased over the past
year or so, while that of short-term external funding has decreased.
8.
By some metrics, housing market conditions have cooled and credit growth to
households has slowed, but risks related to house price and debt levels have not yet
decreased.
 Real house price gains have moderated. Indicators of current conditions such as sales volumes
and the rate of turnover in the housing stock have moderated. The extent of cooling has varied
considerably across capital cities. The strongest price increases continue to be recorded in
Sydney and Melbourne, where underlying demand for housing remains strong. With house
prices still rising ahead of income, standard valuation metrics suggest somewhat higher house
price overvaluation relative to the assessment in 2015 Article IV consultation.
 The flipside has been slowing growth in bank lending to households. APRA prudential
guidance requiring tighter lending standards by banks, which was introduced in late 2014, has
curtailed growth in riskier mortgage loans in particular and credit growth to household more
broadly. At the same time, there has been some upward pressures on mortgage rates, as banks
have increased capital ratios and prepared for a higher risk weight on mortgage lending. That
said, household credit gaps have not yet reversed.
 On the supply side, residential investment has risen to some 0.5 percent of GDP above its longterm average (the ratio remains comparatively low given population and labor force growth). An
above-average number of new apartments is expected to come on stream in the next year or so,
mostly in the downtown areas of Brisbane, Melbourne, and, to a lesser extent, Sydney. Concerns
about temporary oversupply have thus risen. But leading indicators, such as approvals of new
houses and other dwellings or new residential construction starts, have started to level off after
brisk increases in 2014-15. In commercial real estate, property price valuations have increased
but are still within the usual range of variation over the cycle (Box 1).

Household sector leverage has been stable overall despite higher debt, and debt
buffers have risen but not for all households. The household debt ratio rose to 186 percent of
gross disposable income over the past year, but underlying vulnerabilities have not increased to the
same extent. Mortgage buffers—balances in related offset accounts and redraw facilities, which are
held for tax and precautionary reasons—have also risen, to some 18 percent of outstanding
mortgage loans by mid-2016—the equivalent of around 2½ years of scheduled debt payments at
current interest rates. And household leverage (liabilities as a percent of net worth) has been stable
and low at around 25 percent.3 Yet there is considerable heterogeneity across households. With
house values a rising multiple of income, first-time homebuyers and other new borrowers tend to
have higher debt ratios and smaller buffers. Indeed, around 25 percent of all households in each
income quintile had debt to income ratios above 3 in FY2013-14—the latest available year for
income and wealth data across households. These households may well be liquidity-constrained in
an economic downturn.

The household saving ratio has remained relatively high since it rebounded in 2007-08 and household net lending
(saving minus gross fixed capital formation) has been positive since then, implying that households continue to
acquire financial assets. A good part of household financial assets is held in so-called superannuation funds, the
mandatory second pension pillar.

calculations, these capital ratios have placed the
banks at the low end of the top quartile internationally. Bank funding conditions have also
improved, with foreign currency funding continuing to be fully hedged. Nonperforming loans (NPL)
have remained largely unchanged.4

B. Outlook
11.
The baseline outlook is for the resumption of growth close to trend, a gradual return
of inflation into the target range, and a slow stabilization of macro-financial vulnerabilities.
 Growth is expected to be close to trend, with increasing contributions from domestic
demand growth as the adjustment to the commodity and mining shocks advances further.
With the contraction in 2016Q3 largely due to one-off factors, growth is expected to resume in
the last quarter of 2016. Residential investment growth is expected to rebound, given a strong
pipeline of building approvals and housing starts. The contribution of private business
investment to growth should turn positive, as the correction in mining investment should run its
course and non-mining investment should start to pick up. In addition, states that have
experienced rapid growth in activity are expected to ramp up infrastructure spending in 201718. Private consumption should strengthen with the recovery continuing and labor markets
improving further. On the export side, the rate of growth is expected to slow somewhat, as the
initial boost from new mining capacity and new sources of demand (e.g., tourism from Asia)
should moderate.
 The disinflation experienced in 2015-16 is expected to start reversing. With the rebound of
oil prices in 2016, an important source of disinflation has already dissipated. Other sources are
expected to weaken gradually. The output gap is projected to decline, and the inflation effects
from downward pressure on producer price levels from increased competition in the retail
sectors should wear off with no major new market entrants.

4

The NPL ratio of loans to the agricultural sector from the banks’ New Zealand subsidiaries has increased modestly
since the beginning of 2016, but it remains low, at around 1 percent. The overall exposure to the sector is small—
some 1½ percent of banks’ consolidated assets.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

9

AUSTRALIA

 The macro-financial outlook is for a stabilization of housing-related vulnerabilities. The
main driver is a realignment of house price inflation with broader measures of inflation and
robust growth. Recent increases in residential investment should result in higher supply over the
next two years, especially in market segments that have seen higher prices increases, and lower
affordability should constrain demand. Credit gaps and debt ratios should thus stabilize or
decline. On the external side, the accumulation of net external liabilities should slow in the
absence of valuation effects. As banks prepare to meet net stable funding ratio requirements by
2018, related vulnerabilities should improve further.

C. Risks
12.
The balance of risks has improved but is still to the downside. The interaction of external
and domestic downside risks must remain the main policy concern. The momentum of the recovery
could be stronger, as recent terms-of-trade improvements could boost business confidence and
commodity production if they are more persistent than expected. On the downside, growth could
be slower, as consumption growth could remain lackluster with continued low wage growth and
high incidence of part-time work, and profits could remain under pressure for longer with increased
competition and relatively persistent slack. On the external side, there are risks to global trade from
rising populism and nationalism in large economies and from tighter and more volatile global
financial conditions. A major concern for macro-financial risk management is that external risks
could hit both traditionally exposed sectors (commodity prices and exports) and new sources of
growth (e.g., services exports), for example, a sharper growth slowdown in China (Annex V—Risk
Assessment Matrix). If such external risks materialized, they could interact with or even trigger
domestic risks, especially a sharp housing market correction, also given that annual approvals for all
non-residents applying to purchase residential property have substantially increased to around
20 percent of overall turnover value, and they could lead to external funding pressure for banks.

D. The Authorities’ Views on Outlook and Risks
13.
The authorities emphasized that the transition to non-mining-based growth after the
boom was well advanced. They acknowledged that some elements of the “new mediocre” were
present, including weak private business investment. But they saw these as a reflection of the drawn
out adjustment of the economy to the decline in the terms of trade and the large fall in mining
investment rather than a cause. While many of the new jobs were part-time ones, this partly
reflected preferences in the labor force. The rise in underemployment as well as in long-term and
youth unemployment had remained small in historical comparison, and growth in output had
remained close to trend. And while trend growth was lower, the decline was small, about a quarter
of a percentage point, partly reflecting lower population growth, not lower capital intensity or
productivity growth.
14.
Robust broad-based growth was expected to continue. The authorities noted that the
unexpected decline in GDP in the September quarter of 2016 was partly a result of falling mining
investment and a series of one-off factors including weather-related falls in non-residential

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

AUSTRALIA

construction and dwelling investment. Looking forward, economic growth would be supported by
household consumption; another wave of LNG capacity was expected to ramp up, in 2017 as well as
in 2018; public investment growth would rise as States’ infrastructure spending was budgeted to
increase further; residential dwelling investment growth, while moderating, would remain strong in
the near term; and private business investment would no longer detract from growth in 2018 as the
drag from mining investment would ease and non-mining investment would rise moderately. GDP
growth would strengthen to around trend rates. The authorities indicated that the economy would
thus return to full employment gradually, with underemployment declining and inflation moving
back into the target range. While the balance of risks had improved, it remained tilted to the
downside, with the possibility of a hard landing in China being a key medium-term concern.
15.
The authorities noted that risks associated with high and rising household leverage
had diminished. Tighter bank lending standards, encouraged by prudential measures, had led to
slower mortgage credit growth, with improved risks profiles for new loans, and a moderation in
housing price growth. Risks related to short-term demand-supply mismatches in housing markets
were localized. There were some risks related to lending to real estate developers but those were
being closely monitored. Households across all income brackets continue to accumulate deposits in
offset accounts, implying that effective household debt was lower, and did not use mortgage
borrowing to finance consumption. More resilient bank balance sheets were another factor
contributing to diminished housing risks.

ECONOMIC POLICY PRIORITIES
16.
Discussions focused on policy requirements to meet three broad objectives:
Completing the economy’s transition to non-mining growth; containing macro-financial
vulnerabilities; and enhancing longer-term growth potential.

A. Supporting Aggregate Demand
Context
17.
Australia’s transition to non-mining-based growth has advanced significantly with
monetary policy support but the process is not completed. The lack of significant price and
wage pressures suggests that some economic slack is still present, which, if prolonged in what has
already been a drawn-out adjustment process, risks hurting medium-term supply potential.
18.
The RBA cut the policy rate promptly in response to the unexpected downshift in the
expected inflation path in early 2016. The easing also helped to realign the policy rate with
interest rates elsewhere, which had declined in some other major advanced economies through
September 2016. Staff background work suggests that the equilibrium real interest rate has declined
from about 3 percent in the early 1990s to close to 1 percent in the second quarter of 2016
compared to an actual real rate of 0.2 percent, although there is substantial uncertainty around such

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

AUSTRALIA

estimates.5 Absent monetary easing, upward pressure on the Australian dollar would likely have
been stronger, reinforcing the disinflationary impulse experienced early in the year.
19.
Australia has substantial fiscal space. Standard metrics suggest that Australia has fiscal
space under both the baseline and economic stress scenarios (Annex VI—External and Fiscal Debt
Sustainability Analysis). For example, sovereign spreads over U.S. bonds have been relatively
moderate in the past 12 months (at most 64 basis points); gross debt is still low at 40 percent of
GDP compared with other major advanced economies.
20.
The federal government has recently aimed for substantial near-term fiscal
consolidation but budget targets have not been met because of weaker nominal income.
Automatic stabilizers have been allowed to operate in response to weaker growth and lower
inflation, and the fiscal stance in 2016 is estimated to have been broadly neutral. Against this
backdrop, concerns about recent public debt increases and what they mean for Australia’s topranked sovereign debt rating have dominated fiscal policy discussions.
21.
In the FY2016/17 budget, the government has projected a return to fiscal balance by
FY2020/21. It has also renewed its commitment to a federal government surplus of 1 percent of
GDP over the business cycle as a medium-term fiscal anchor, which would imply a cumulative
adjustment of up to 3.4 percent of GDP. The Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook 2016-17
(MYEFO), released on December 19, 2016 foresees a cumulative adjustment of the fiscal balance of
2.1 percent of GDP by end of FY2019/20, as revenues strengthen in line with the economy, primarily
related to stronger personal income tax collection because of bracket creep.
Staff Views
22.
The RBA’s monetary policy stance should remain accommodative until the return of
inflation to the mid-point of the target range is highly secured. Australia has not experienced
the persistent low inflation problem of other advanced economies, and medium-term inflation
expectations, while lower, have generally remained within the target range. But with economic slack
expected to decline only gradually and taking into account downside risks, policy decisions should
remain predicated on the possibility that the return of inflation back to target may take longer,
consistent with recent international experience. And in current circumstances, there are asymmetric
costs to inflation risks, given policy objectives. The risk of inflation rising faster than expected is less
costly than risks of inflation being lower. Monetary policy can likely respond more effectively to
positive surprises for some time, given that from current policy settings, policy rates may rapidly
reach the effective lower bound if negative surprises reflect large shocks to demand.
23.
The RBA could consider enhancing its policy communication given the inflation
outlook and the risk of hitting the effective lower bound under a downside scenario. While
increases of longer-term interest rates in advanced economies since October are suggestive of some

5

See Annex VII for a summary of the forthcoming selected issues paper by Helbling, Kamenik, Karam, Laxton, Wang,
and Yao, 2016, “Inflation Targeting in Australia: Performance, Challenges and Strategy Going Forward.”

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

AUSTRALIA

increase in underlying equilibrium interest rates, policy rates in Australia may well stay low for some
time. Under these conditions, risks of low inflation becoming entrenched could be reduced through
clear guidance by the RBA on the horizon over which inflation is expected to return to the mid-point
of the target range and on the likely policy measures should downside risks materialize. To lay the
foundation, the RBA could consider lengthening the forecast horizon in its Statements on Monetary
Policy. More clarity on the policy rate path, possibly through publication of the RBA’s projected
policy rate path, could also enhance the RBA’s communication with markets and price setters.
24.
The government should use its fiscal space for a gradual fiscal consolidation and
structural fiscal reform. The conditions calling for more pro-active fiscal stimulus, including policy
rates at the effective lower bound and impaired monetary policy transmission, are not present.
Some fiscal consolidation remains desirable—not the least in view of a sizeable structural budget
deficit and impending medium-term increases in ageing-related spending. However, Australia has
the fiscal space to undertake budget repair gradually. Any remaining negative demand effects could
be offset by continuing accommodative monetary policy, expenditure switching, and growthfriendly structural fiscal reform. In contrast, a front-loaded fiscal consolidation based on measures
would pose too much of a risk to the on-going recovery. The MYEFO 2016-17 shows a fiscal
improvement based on an economic recovery, broadly consistent with staff’s views on growth in the
coming years.

25.
Structural fiscal reform should focus on supporting growth through increased
spending on infrastructure, innovation, labor market integration, and tax reform.
 There is room for greater infrastructure investment. While general government spending
on infrastructure has increased in FY2016/17, this increase primarily reflects higher spending
by States, not the Commonwealth. Indeed, capital spending is expected to increase by ½ of
a percentage point of GDP in the current budget year, but these efforts are not expected to
be sustained as spending is projected to level off in the next fiscal year and to decline
thereafter. A more sustained, multi-year increase in spending on efficient infrastructure also
at the Commonwealth level would be desirable, considering that Australia has infrastructure
needs and fiscal space and the funding environment is favorable.
 Reforms that support innovation and productivity should be strengthened. These would
include an upgrade of the R&D tax credits put in place last year and active labor market
policies, to lower risks of hysteresis in labor markets and support human capital formation in
an environment of rapid structural change, increased part-time employment, and higher
long-term unemployment.
 A tax shift, lowering corporate and household income taxes while increasing the goods
and services tax (GST), could boost investment and lift GDP. Background work using the
IMF’s G20MOD suggests that in Australia, the long-term multipliers for a 1 percent of GDP
shift from corporate income taxes to the GST is roughly 0.6 percent of GDP, while that of

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

AUSTRALIA

labor income taxes to the GST is over 0.1 percent of GDP. A revenue-neutral tax shift should
thus lead to a permanent increase in the level of real GDP. 6
26.
Should downside risks materialize, fiscal stimulus may be needed to boost aggregate
demand, as monetary policy may rapidly be constrained by the effective lower bound. If the
shock is large, an effective macroeconomic policy response may well require expansionary fiscal
policy. In a China downside scenario, model-based scenario analysis in background work by staff
illustrates how a combined monetary and fiscal policy response ensures a faster recovery (Box 2).
With some high-impact downside risks to the near- and medium-term outlook present, contingency
plans for expansionary fiscal policy should be prepared, given the implementation lags involved in
undertaking fiscal stimulus. Such contingency plans should include a revolving pipeline of ready-toimplement infrastructure projects, with coordination between the Commonwealth and State
governments.
27.
An IMF staff review of the fiscal anchor and framework suggests that the authorities
consider changing to a long-term debt anchor.7 In 2010, the government raised the mediumterm anchor from a zero balance to a surplus of 1 percent, with a view to reverse the recent debt
accumulation. In staff’s view, it is a strength of Australia’s fiscal framework that it requires
governments to report against a medium-term fiscal strategy based on “principles of sound fiscal
management.” But the authorities should consider replacing the current medium-term budget
balance anchor with a longer-term debt anchor. The latter would provide certainty about debt and
fiscal policy in the future. Once in place, the debt anchor would encourage the government to
discuss the implication of unanticipated shocks on the fiscal position and the medium-term fiscal
strategy. At the same time, if implemented over a 5- to 10-year horizon, the framework would
remain sufficiently flexible to allow for countercyclical fiscal policy support if needed.
Authorities’ Views
28.
The RBA was concerned about the potential costs to financial stability from further
monetary easing relative to the benefits of inflation returning to target faster. Against
expectations of robust growth and improving labor markets, it considered risks of inflation
becoming entrenched below target to be low. The undershooting of core inflation was recent. But
the RBA was ready to ease further should the outlook for labor markets and inflation deteriorate
materially. RBA officials saw costs and benefits to changing policy communication strategies. While
RBA staff were working on extending the forecast horizon, they were concerned that conditional
forecasts of the policy rate path could be misread as RBA commitment. RBA officials noted that they
could use unconventional monetary policy measures should the need arise, with circumstances
dictating the instruments to be used. However, they considered the risks of reaching the effective

AUSTRALIA

lower bound for policy rates to be low, partly because the Australian dollar usually depreciated in
the case of adverse external shocks. This, in turn, could ease the burden on monetary policy in
responding to a downturn.
29.
The authorities were less sanguine than staff about the extent of available fiscal space
and did not think that current circumstances required its active use. They noted concerns by
rating agencies about the sizeable and persistent budget deficits and emphasized that being a
capital importing country, which generally runs current account deficits, requires greater fiscal
prudence than otherwise. In their view, the economy could absorb the proposed path of fiscal
consolidation, noting that much of the expected increase in revenue was through household income
tax bracket creep, rather than measures with higher multipliers. However, they agreed that, in the
face of negative economic shocks, such as a sharp slowdown in China, increased fiscal spending
would need to be considered, as the effectiveness of monetary easing might be diminished.
Concerns about a widening current account deficit could be mitigated if it is driven by fiscal
spending that encourages stronger domestic investment instead of only weakening saving ratios.
30.
The authorities felt that the composition of fiscal adjustment was as important as the
pace of consolidation. In this respect, they noted that past spending increases often focused on
recurrent spending. Some of the spending had not been productive, while other spending could be
reduced while maintaining or improving outcomes through increased productivity in the delivery of
services. Restraining recurrent spending would help in increasing productive spending, on
infrastructure investment, nurturing innovation, and on measures encouraging private investment,
real wages and incomes in the private sector. This in turn would help on the revenue side as well,
particularly for healthy labor income tax revenues, which depend on growth to induce bracket creep.

B. Managing Macro-Financial Vulnerabilities
Context
31.
Momentum in house prices and housing credit has moderated and bank balance
sheets have strengthened with prudential and regulatory steps, but vulnerabilities have not
yet decreased materially. Intrinsic housing market risks have become more localized. The
escalation of APRA’s supervisory intensity, including guidance on lending standards, over the past
year and a half has contributed to lowering growth in new, higher risk lending (e.g., with loan-tovalue ratios of more than 80 percent), while housing market conditions have cooled broadly.
Nevertheless, risks of renewed price acceleration remain, as mortgage and interest rates more
broadly are still low, while foreign investment interest in residential property in the major cities
continues to be strong. And high household debt could still amplify the negative impact of large
shocks. Regulatory steps under the Basel III framework have contributed to banks’ stronger capital
positions. As of January 2016, banks had to meet a capital conservation buffer of 2.5 percent of
RWA, and a buffer for domestic systemically important institutions of 1 percent of RWA became
effective. The counter-cyclical capital buffer is currently set at zero. In addition, in July 2016, a floor
for mortgage risk weights for banks using the IRB approach took effect. Tighter prudential rules do

not seem to have led to migration of credit activity to non-banks, and the shadow banking sector in
Australia has remained relatively small over recent years.
Staff Views
32.
With signs of a cooling housing market, the tightening of prudential measures should
remain a contingency. Under the IMF staff’s macro-financial baseline outlook, tighter loan
restrictions could accelerate a cooling in housing market, which would be pro-cyclical. In markets
where a house price correction has already begun—in the mining states, for example—they risk
delaying the recovery from the commodity bust, including by hindering labor mobility. But with
continued upside risks to house prices and housing lending growth, APRA should stand ready with
targeted prudential measures. Minimum amortization requirements for new loans could also be
considered to rein interest-only lending further.
33.
Banks’ should further strengthen their capital position, which would increase their
resilience to housing and other macro-financial shocks. This approach would focus on
strengthening banks’ ability to absorb losses from a more significant housing market correction. For
instance, APRA could consider adjustments to the level of required capital, dependent on banks’
exposure to risky housing market segments and lending standards in those segments (pillar 2
adjustments). Alternatively, it could consider introducing higher minimum risk weights for some
lending, notably higher-risk housing-related loans. With expectations of lower profitability in the
sector, it will be important for banks to remain in a position to continue to generate sufficient
internal capital to finance the growth of their balance sheets and maintain unquestionably strong
capital ratios.
34.
In the longer term, the macro-financial resilience of the economy to housing market
shocks could be enhanced through tax reform. The Commonwealth tax system provides
households with incentives for leveraged real estate investment that likely amplifies housing cycles.
The incentives arise from the combination of tax concessions on capital gains and the possibility to
apply losses from negative gearing to income from other sources. Reforms of capital gain tax
concessions would need to be undertaken in a broader context, to avoid introducing new distortions
in the taxation of different assets.
35.
Broader progress in implementing the regulatory reform agenda would also help in
lowering and managing financial sector risks. APRA’s efforts to develop an operational
framework to assess whether Australian banks are “unquestionable strong” in international
comparison will further reduce bank-related financial stability risks. Another priority are reforms
recommended in the 2014 Financial Sector Inquiry for increasing the resilience of the banking
system, such as the implementation of a framework for loss absorbing and recapitalization capacity
and the introduction of a leverage ratio, in the context of international regulatory developments.
36.
The authorities are taking steps to address the lack of adequate AML/CFT safeguards
in the real estate sector. In 2015, the Mutual Evaluation Report of Australia’s AML/CFT regime by
the Financial Action Task Force found that the real estate sector is exposed to significant money

16

AUSTRALIA

laundering risk and should be subject to AML/CFT safeguards in line with the international
standards. In response, Australia has recently completed a statutory review of its AML/CFT regime
and initiated a consultation process about regulating real estate professionals under the AML/CFT
Act. The cost-benefit analysis of different regulatory models is expected to be completed by July
2017.
37.
Remittance flows from Australia have remained broadly stable while regional
correspondent banking relationships with Australian banks have continued. AUSTRAC’s
tracking of international funds flowing through financial intermediaries registered in Australia
suggests no significant change in patterns or magnitudes of remittance flows. That said, money
transfer operators have been subject to structural change, given evolving financial technology, and
regulatory change. While some operators have had their bank accounts closed, this has only
affected a subset among them. However, money transfer operators have faced increased costs and
complexities of doing business. At this stage, there is no evidence that Australian banks have
stopped correspondent banking and other business with neighboring Pacific Islands. Nevertheless,
recognizing the potential for negative spillovers, the authorities have formed a high-level
interdepartmental committee to coordinate policies, intensified consultation with the industry,
provided neighboring countries with technical assistance to deal with AML/CFT challenges, and
actively engaged in the G20 Global Partnership for Financial Inclusion.
Authorities’ Views
38.
The authorities concurred that policies should focus on further strengthening
resilience to housing market and other shocks with macro-financial implication. Regarding
“unquestionably strong” capital ratio of banks, APRA stressed that a top quartile positioning relative
to international peers is only one guidepost and that other benchmarks would be used as well. For
example, capital positions against rating agency measures of capital strength would be assessed and
the result of stress tests can also be informative. In terms of timing, APRA did not expect that final
standards on unquestionably strong capital ratio would be released soon, given that 2017 will be a
year of consultation. The standards would be unlikely to take effect until at least a year after that to
facilitate an orderly build-up of capital. APRA indicated openness to the use of a range of prudential
measures in case they are needed.
39.
The Treasury continues its efforts to introduce new legislation to deliver on the
Government’s financial system agenda. In its response to the recommendations of the Financial
System Inquiry (FSI), the government announced 48 measures, including on the crisis management
toolkit, banks resolution, and consumer protection, which require legislation to be prepared and
worked through the legislative process.

C. Keeping Up Productivity Growth
40.
Maintaining high productivity growth rates may be challenging. Aggregate labor
productivity growth in Australia has remained stable over the past decade and a half, increasing at
an annual average rate of around 1.5 percent. More recently, however, labor productivity growth has
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

AUSTRALIA

slowed, with weaker multifactor productivity especially in the services sectors, which have accounted
for most of the growth in employment since the end of the mining boom. At the same time, weak
non-mining investment has likely resulted in less capital deepening.
41.
Moving ahead with a range of smaller reforms may nevertheless boost productivity.
After a wave of reforms in the early 1990s, there are few low-hanging fruit in terms of large-scale
structural policies. Australia generally ranks favorably compared to other OECD countries in key
“ease of doing business” areas, although its relatively favorable position has eroded over time as
other countries have also improved and progress on reforms in Australia has slowed. Policy priorities
have been identified in commissioned expert Reviews and Inquiries, while the Productivity
Commission provides the government with research and analysis. The reform agenda, including on
the tax side, has been shaped by the 2015 Competition Policy Review (“Harper Review”) and the 2014
Financial System Inquiry (“Murray Inquiry”).
Staff Views
42.
Recent structural reforms have appropriately focused on fostering innovation.
Innovation is key to factor productivity growth, but there are sizeable gaps relative to the frontier in
this dimension. Investment in knowledge capital is relatively low in Australia, partly reflecting low
R&D spending relative to other advanced economies. The government’s National Innovation and
Science Agenda (NISA) allocates $1.1 billion (less than 0.1 percent of GDP) over four years to boost
innovation and entrepreneurship in the high-tech sector, including through tax breaks. Recognizing
the difficulties in fostering innovation through policies, the authorities are closely monitoring
outcomes to ensure policy effectiveness. The government plans to continue and expand the
program if it proves to be effective.
43.
Product market reforms can be expanded in targeted areas. The Harper Review has
identified a number of reforms to boost competition and productivity in the services sectors, and to
strengthen competition policy broadly. Some of the major benefits from the proposed measures
arise from reforms to increase competition in the delivery of human services on behalf of
governments, and in other markets including construction, retail trade, and transport. A number of
these reforms will have to be implemented at the state level, which will require complex
coordination between the Commonwealth and State governments, in legislation and through
intergovernmental agreements. Legislation for key components are still under preparation, and
efforts to expedite implementation of the Harper Review would be beneficial. In addition, efforts to
increase competition in the financial sector, including through implementation of measures
identified in the Murray Inquiry, should continue.
44.
Trade liberalization is another means to increase competition and Australia intends to
continue efforts towards further liberalization in regional and multilateral fora. Aside from
benefiting from traditional lines of exports, Australia would also stand to gain from enhanced access
to service export markets, which would also serve to strengthen service sector productivity in
Australia. At the same time, active labor market policies and the social safety net would help to
mitigate the cost to those who would bear the burden of adjustment.

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

AUSTRALIA

45.
Tax reforms appear challenging in the current political environment. The government
managed to achieve passage of a tax cut for small business in the current Budget, but has yet to
introduce similar measures for larger firms. Such a measure should be part of a package of broader
reforms that remains to be accomplished, including reducing tax concessions, and the shift in the
tax mix discussed above as part of structural fiscal reforms. Such reforms could enhance
productivity.
46.
Labor markets have performed well. The flexible labor market settings have contributed
to a smooth adjustment from the mining boom with low unemployment. However, the elevated rate
of underemployment, and persistent youth unemployment could lead to diminished incentives to
accumulate human capital if not addressed. While the gradual elimination of economic slack should
help to ease some of the potential for problems, the authorities should remain vigilant to prevent
deepening skill mismatches and labor market hysteresis. In this context, the government’s $840
million Youth Employment Package, which seeks to increase employability of youth mainly through
wage subsidies, is a welcome step.
Authorities’ Views
47.
The authorities agreed that the productivity growth environment is challenging. While
labor productivity growth has been stable, it is expected to grow at a somewhat slower rate over the
next few years. Moreover, half the aggregate labor productivity growth recorded recently was
contributed by the mining sector, which has moved to the less labor-intensive production phase
after a long investment phase.
48.
The authorities aimed to improve productivity through targeted steps, with legislative
steps under preparation. With key economy-wide reforms already implemented, future
productivity gains would require specific measures, which include increasing contestability in
markets for services, and boosting innovation capacity and absorption. Reforms identified in the
Harper Review would primarily have to be implemented at the state level, and would require close
coordination between the Commonwealth and State governments. The government is finalizing
intergovernmental agreements and National Partnerships detailing funding for measures taken at
the state level. These Partnerships are expected to be formed by mid-2017 to mid-2018. Other
reforms proposed in the Harper Review can be implemented by the Commonwealth government
and may be introduced as early as mid-2017.
49.
Innovation was emphasized as a priority. The government’s NISA would help to boost
innovation capacity by seeking to encourage entrepreneurship, and to enhance industry-science
collaboration. Future waves of NISA would envisage building science capability in niche areas such
as health or data analytics, encouraging private sector investment in innovation and making it easier
for business to interact with Government.
50.
The authorities were pressing ahead with trade liberalization. They were committed to
the passage of the TPP. Even if it were not to come into force because some other signatories may
not pass it, the authorities were committed to implementing as many of its provisions as possible by

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

AUSTRALIA

other means such as bilateral agreements – for example, the recent expansion of its 2003 free trade
agreement with Singapore. They were also interested in continuing negotiations for the RCEP
(Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership), which includes China and the Asia-Pacific TPP
signatories.

STAFF APPRAISAL
51.
Context. Australia has experienced robust growth and low unemployment during the
drawn-out adjustment to the commodity price and mining investment bust, highlighting the
resilience of the economy and strong policy frameworks. But it has not been immune to symptoms
of the “new mediocre.” Wage and price pressures have been weak, underemployment has risen, and
private business investment outside mining has been lackluster.
52.
Outlook and risks. After a growth pickup from mid-2015, real GDP unexpectedly contracted
in 2016Q3, largely on account of one-off factors, so growth close to trend is expected to resume.
The balance of risks to the growth outlook improved in 2016 but remains tilted to the downside.
While recent terms-of-trade improvements provide for some upside, domestic demand could
remain lackluster with continued weak wage growth and underemployment. A major concern is that
high-impact external risks could interact with or even trigger domestic risks, especially a housing
correction.
53.
On the macro-financial side, prudential policies have contributed to a tentative
stabilization of housing-related and external vulnerabilities. APRA’s prudential measures
introduced in late 2014 have improved the risk profile of new loans. While household debt has
remained high, risks to banks and to household balance sheets have been mitigated by the strong
growth in mortgage buffers. The macro-financial risk outlook has also improved as banks’ balance
sheets have become more resilient with higher capital ratios and a higher share of stable funding.
54.
The economic policy agenda should center on three priorities: Demand support to
ensure completion of the transition to non-mining-based growth; further reductions in macrofinancial vulnerabilities, and reforms to enhance the longer-term growth potential.
55.
The monetary policy stance should remain accommodative. Australia’s low inflation is
more recent, but policy decisions should remain predicated on the possibility that inflation may
return into the target range later than expected, given international experience. Prudential measures
to address housing-related risks have mitigated risks to balance sheets and financial stability from
lower policy rates.
56.
Australia still has substantial fiscal space despite recent public debt increases, which
allows for a gradual approach to fiscal consolidation and higher growth-friendly spending.
 The government appropriately plans to balance the budget over four years, while
making the expenditure composition more growth-friendly. Efforts focus on supporting
longer-term inclusive growth, including by boosting innovation and tax reform.
 The envisaged fiscal consolidation risks being too front-loaded. Over the next two years,
the budget targets reductions in the structural budget deficit of close to 1½ percent. This

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

AUSTRALIA

ambitious pace risks being counterproductive in the current phase of the recovery, especially
if it does not provide for the increases in productive spending needed to support longerterm growth.
 A more sustained public investment effort. A multi-year increase in spending on efficient
infrastructure beyond the planned current short-lived increase would be desirable,
considering that Australia has infrastructure needs and fiscal space.
57.
If high-impact downside risks were to materialize, fiscal policy should support
aggregate demand, as monetary policy could be constrained by the effective lower bound.
Developing contingency plans and a pipeline of infrastructure projects would help reduce
implementation lags in undertaking fiscal stimulus.
58.
With more acute risks concentrated in a few specific housing market segments,
policies should focus on further strengthening resilience to housing market and other shocks
with macro-financial implications.
 With continued upside risks to house prices, APRA should stand ready to intensify targeted
prudential measures, if lending or house price growth were to re-accelerate.
 APRA should continue to actively encourage banks’ efforts to robustly anchor their capital
position in “unquestionably strong” territory, given a highly concentrated banking sector
where banks have similar business models.
 Treasury’s preparation of new legislation to further the regulatory reform agenda should
continue to complete the implementation of the FSI recommendations. APRA should
continue in its effort to implement prudential steps to strengthen the loss absorbing and
recapitalization capacity of banks and introduce leverage ratios, in line with the international
agenda.
59.
The government’s structural reform agenda appropriately focuses on fostering
innovation and strengthening competition, and the intention to push for trade liberalization
is welcome. The NISA, is an important step forward. The efforts should continue, as currently
envisaged, and, if effective, be expanded. The measures recommended by the Harper Review would
strengthen services sector competition and productivity, but implementation will require determined
effort. Expanding access to service export markets could also strengthen services sector productivity
in Australia and elsewhere, while the social safety net and active labor market policies could mitigate
the cost to those who bear the burden of adjustment.

Box 1. Developments in Australia’s Commercial Real Estate Market
Signs of commercial real estate overvaluation have emerged. Commercial real estate (CRE) prices
in Australia have increased rapidly since mid-2014. Rents have not followed at the same pace, and the
price-to-rent (PR) ratio is now above average. Whether the latter is a good metric of fair value is
difficult to assess. But the deviations from average are now close to levels last seen before the global
financial crisis. Shortly thereafter, there was a sharp correction in CRE prices in the context of the crisis.
Internationally, Australia’s CRE PR ratio is closer to the pre-crisis maximum than in almost all other
countries for which data are available, with the notable exception of the United States and Canada. The
valuation increases may in part reflect the strong interest of foreign investors in Australian CRE assets.

Risks to financial stability from any potential CRE overvaluation appear manageable. The share of
CRE lending in commercial banks’ total assets decreased in the past few years and has now stabilized at
around 5 percent. Even so, banks’ lending growth to CRE has been rising recently, with increased
contribution by Australian branches of foreign banks. The share of impaired CRE assets over total CRE
assets has declined and the impaired assets are almost fully provisioned. While a downturn in the CRE
market would likely not pose a major financial stability risk, it may still have important macroeconomic
effects as Australia’s CRE capital expenditures as a percent of GDP are relatively high in comparison.

Box 2. A China Downside Scenario with Monetary and Fiscal Policy Responses
Disappointing external environment may require a ‘low for longer’ strategy for monetary
policy. We consider alternative simulations where China’s economic growth surprises on the
downside. This has significant spillover effects on the rest of the world and a sizable impact on
commodity prices. This downside scenario implies an opening up of the effective foreign output
gap relevant for the Australian economy (defined as export-weighted output gaps for Australia’s
main trading partners). Specifically, the effective foreign output gap is 2.3 percentage points lower
and metal prices are 5.3 percent lower at the trough compared to the baseline. Under the blue line,
in anticipation of the negative shocks, the policy rate declines to the effective lower bound
(assumed to be 0.75 percent) and stays there for 2 years. This results in a further depreciation in the
Australian dollar that helps support the economy. However, a sizable negative output gap remains
for the Australian economy as largely dominated by the magnitude of the negative shock. Headline
inflation slightly overshoots the 2.5 percent mid-point of the RBA’s 2-3 percent inflation target
range.
A combined monetary-fiscal policy would provide a much-needed shot in the arm for the
Australian economy if the downside shocks were to materialize. Under this case, a direct fiscal
stimulus is used to help deal with the negative external shocks hitting the Australian economy. The
direct effects of the fiscal stimulus are equal to 0.25 percent of GDP for 2017-18. Monetary policy
provides the ‘supporting role’ to a much-welcomed fiscal expansion by cutting the policy rate
aggressively to its lower bound faster than under the previous case. This helps raise inflation and
generate a modest overshoot of inflation above the upper bound of the 2-3 percent target range
over the medium term. This planned overshoot of inflation raises inflation expectations and reduces
the real interest rates, which combined with more depreciated exchange rate helps close the output
gap much faster. A faster recovery of the economy under this more accommodative strategy allows
monetary policy to renormalize earlier than under the previous case.

Annex I. Four Years after the Bust….
The sizeable bust in commodity prices and rapid decline in mining investment has been weathered
well by the Australian economy. The decline in investment has been partly offset by rising resource
exports, supporting value addition and employment linked to the resource sector in other
industries. Household real incomes have been shielded from the commodity price bust as profits
have absorbed much of the decline.
This annex examines some of the factors limiting the negative impact of a historic boom-bust cycle in mining
investment and commodity prices on the economy. Over the boom period, mining investment rose from its
average of around 2 percent of GDP to over 9 percent by 2013, net terms of trade doubled, and resource
exports rose from 6 percent of GDP to 11 percent. Expansion of mining also increased demand for other
industries, and the value added share of the broadly defined “resource sector” including directly extractive
industries and support industries in aggregate nominal gross value added rose from 4¼ percent over 19902004 to 14¼ percent in 2011/12.1 The share of the resource sector in employment doubled from around
5 percent over 1990-2004 to just under 10 percent in 2011/12, mostly among support industries, while the
employment share of the mining sector itself remained around 2 percent.
Four years into the bust, mining investment has declined sharply, but growing resource exports have
dampened the negative impact of declining investment, and will continue to do so in the near term as new
capacities ramp up and investment returns to more normal levels. Resource sector value added peaked at
15.5 percent of GDP in 2013/14, following the peak in mining investment. About half (8 percent of GDP) was
value addition within the mining sector itself. The remainder was value addition in support sectors: 4 percent
of GDP due to mining exports, and 3¼ percent of GDP due to investment (chart 1; table 1 lists the
contribution of key support industries). Export-related value addition is expected to support a gradual decline
in resource value added to around 11 percent of GDP by 2017/18.
Resource sector employment also peaked in 2013/14 at 10 percent of total employment (chart 2), of which
only 2 percent was in direct mining activity and the rest was in support sectors. By 2015/16, resource
employment declined only gradually, in line with the decline in resource sector value added. In addition, the
investment decline has been cushioned by a strong housing sector, particularly for the construction sector
which had a relatively higher exposure to mining investment.
The impact of the decline in commodity prices on household incomes has been mitigated by declining profits.
Australia had experienced a so called “income recession” in late-2015 (adjusting GDP for the terms of trade
decline), but real producer wages have in fact risen sharply since the end of the boom despite weaker nominal
wage growth (chart 3), indicating that the impact of lower output prices has not been transferred entirely to
wages. Producer wages stayed relatively low during the boom, and the share of profits in income was rising,
whereas it has steadily declined since the 2011 peak in commodity prices. Moreover, consumer wages rose
faster than producer wages during the boom, due in part to exchange rate appreciation. Estimates of
exchange rate pass-through to CPI prices in Australia suggest that a 10 percent appreciation is linked with a
1 percent decline in consumer prices, which would imply a sizeable impact given the large real appreciation.
On the downswing, depreciation has not translated into retail inflation as expected, which may be attributed
to both weaker import prices (as manufacturing shifts globally to cheaper locations) and more domestic retail
sector competition.

1
Based on the” narrow measure” as described in Rayner and Bishop (2013). The analysis here extends their work, with
the latest input-output table for 2013-14, and projected resource exports and investment. Resource sector value
added estimates are broadly comparable to the “narrow measure” noted above. Resource related employment in an
industry is assumed to be proportional to the share of resource sector related value added share in total industry
value added.

Note that this measure of value added generation considers
only mining exports and investment in plant/machinery and
construction in final demand. It excludes value added in the
mining sector due to domestic demand for mining output.
The results are broadly comparable to those of the "narrow
measure" provided in Rayner and Bishop (2013), though the
latter also exclude exports of manufactured resource exports
in the narrow measure (while those are included in export
demand here).

Annex II. Australia’s External Balance Sheet: Developments and
Risk Profile
Australia’s net external liability position increased markedly over the past year. This annex documents
that this increase largely reflected a set of atypical valuation effects and, for the ratio to GDP,
exceptionally low nominal GDP growth that are atypical compared to usual patterns. The risk profile of
Australia’s net external position, however, has remained broadly stable.
Net foreign liabilities amounted to 63 percent of GDP by the end of 2016Q3, about
7 percentage points higher than they were in mid-2015. This unusually steep increase occurred
even though the current account deficit shrunk from around 5 percent of GDP to below 3 percent of
GDP over the same period. Valuation effects—changes in the market value of external assets and
liabilities—partly explain the contrasting behavior. Nominal GDP growth was exceptionally low
because of sharply deteriorating terms of trade through the first half of 2016. Australia stands
second to New Zealand among AAA-rated countries in relative size of net foreign liabilities to GDP.

Valuation effects have mitigated the impact of persistent current account deficits on
Australia’s net external liabilities. As of 2016Q3, the cumulated current account deficits since
1988Q3 (the period during which quarterly balance of payments statistics are available) amounted
to about 72 percent of GDP. Offsetting this, valuation effects helped improve the net external
liabilities by 10 percentage points of GDP over the same period. Analysis of the valuation effects
following an approach reviewed by Gourinchas and Rey (2015) suggests that the return on external
assets has been some half of a percentage point higher than that on external liabilities.1 Despite
external liabilities being substantially larger than external assets, the rate of return on the net
external assets has still been positive. But it has been smaller than the rate of growth. Australia’s
debt-stabilizing current account deficit has thus been close to 4 percent of GDP.
Over the past year, negative valuation effects, especially losses on Australia’s equity assets,
have resulted in a higher return on its net external liabilities. At the same time, the nominal GDP

growth was exceptionally low because of the impact on the GDP deflator of the large terms-of-trade
declines during the period. In the absence of valuation effects over the forecast horizon, the expected
pickup in nominal GDP growth should result in a broadly stable net external liability position.

The structure of Australia’s net external liabilities has remained broadly stable in terms of
currency and asset composition, but its sectoral composition has changed.


Currency. As of mid-2016, 87 percent of liabilities were denominated in domestic currency,
while 56 percent of assets are in foreign currencies. On net, Australia thus had a long foreign
currency position equals to 49 percent of GDP. The implication is that depreciation of the
Australian dollar against the currencies in which its external assets are invested in leads to
improvements in the external balance sheet. In the aggregate, depreciation does not come with
the adverse balance sheet effects it would have with a net short foreign-currency position. For
individual firms or households, however, there could still be negative effects. But banks’ debt
service obligations in foreign currency are fully hedged, while mining companies have natural
hedges given commodity pricing standards.



Maturity and Type. At the end of 2016Q3, 87 percent of net liabilities are in long-term debt
instruments (exceeding 1 year in maturity) and 14 percent in short-term debt, the net long
position in equity is broadly balanced. The share of short-term external debt liabilities has
decreased in recent years, partly because of banks increasing the share of more stable, longerterm debt in their wholesale funding.

Sectors.2 With the mining investment boom, the mining sector’s net external liabilities have
increased by some 20 percentage points of GDP. At about 40 percent, the sector accounts for
the largest share of total net external liabilities. Banks now account for some 36 percent. With
greater emphasis on stable funding sources, their net external liabilities as a share of GDP have
decreased by about 3 percentage points of GDP since the global financial crisis. With the
housing boom, the real estate sector has also posted an increase in its net external liabilities,
increasing from 0.4 to 11.7 percent of GDP between 2006 and 2016.3 The other financial sector,
which includes superannuation (the private second pension pillar), is the only private sector with
a net foreign asset position. Its net position has increased by some 20 percentage points of GDP,
reflecting the net accumulation of assets in the sector (contributions exceed withdrawals in the
aggregate), some of which are invested abroad.

Annex III. Summary – Labor Market Adjustment to Shocks in
Australia

44



Australia’s labor markets were relatively little disrupted by the global financial crisis,
and are adjusting smoothly to the sizeable commodity price bust and mining
investment decline. Unemployment rose relatively little post-GFC compared to other
advanced economies. After the commodity price bust, unemployment peaked at 6¼ percent
in mid-2015 and has been declining since, and the unemployment gap is assessed to be
small.



However, some labor market indicators suggest persistent weakness. For instance, longterm unemployment remains elevated. Underemployment has also persisted above long run
averages, and is a possible driver of weaker wage growth since the commodity price bust.



In this context, the paper conducts a more detailed assessment of the labor market
impact of the adverse shocks. It addresses the following key questions:

o

Has the commodity price bust and mining investment decline led to a worsening in skills
mismatch and other frictions?

o

Have cyclical labor adjustment dynamics changed over time? What are the implications for
assessment of labor market slack, and relatedly for wage growth?

o

Has changing sectoral allocation of labor had an impact in the transition?

o

What is the role played by migration in state level adjustment to shocks, particularly in the
context of the commodity boom-bust cycle?



Salient findings for policy analysis consideration are as follows:

o

Beveridge curve analysis suggests that the increase in long-term unemployment does not
indicate any significant worsening in structural unemployment since the commodity price
bust.

o

Average hours worked have adjusted more flexibly in downturns, with employment
reductions smaller since the 2000s. However, rising part time employment and falling
average hours worked are likely driving higher underemployment. A wage Phillips curve
suggests that underemployment helps explain some of the recent weakness in wage growth.

o

Aggregate labor productivity growth has on average remained stable in the 2000s, but more
recently, the expansion of services employment has contributed to the weakness in labor
productivity growth.

o

At the state level, a VAR analysis suggests that changes in migration have played a key role
in the supply side response to employment (demand) shocks, supporting a smooth
adjustment particularly in the context of the mining boom-bust cycle.

Background
Notes

Overall Assessment:
In 2016 the external position was
assessed to be moderately weaker than
the level consistent with medium term
fundamentals and desirable policies.
The widening of the current account
deficit in 2015, notwithstanding
substantial currency depreciation in
2014-15, was likely temporary, partly
reflecting exceptionally large terms of
trade declines in the context of
commodity price declines and
stronger-than-expected domestic
demand growth in a weaker external
environment. The Australian dollar has
depreciated with the large
deterioration in the terms of trade and
supported expenditure switching,
including by boosting services and
non-resource exports. The
depreciation in 2014-15 likely reduced
the overvaluation of the Australian
dollar, although the correction has
stalled in recent months. Some
remaining exchange rate overvaluation
might be accounted for by the relative
attractiveness of highly-rated
Australian assets.

Background. A free-floater since 1983. The central bank undertook brief but large intervention in 2007–08 when
the market for Australian dollars became illiquid (bid-ask spreads widened) following banking sector disruptions in
the U.S. The authorities are strongly committed to a floating regime which reduces the need for reserve holding.
Assessment. Although domestic banks’ external liabilities are sizable, they are either in local currency or hedged
with little or no counterparty risks, so reserve needs for prudential reasons are also limited.

The government’s planned gradual
fiscal consolidation over the longer
term should help improve the current
account by boosting national savings.

1/ The EBA CA regression approach for 2016 estimates a CA norm of -1.0 percent of GDP and a CA gap of -1.9
percent of GDP. Using estimated elasticities, the current account approach would be consistent with an exchange
rate overvaluation of around 11 percent in 2016. However, the estimates of the CA norm may not capture
Australia-specific factors such as the attractiveness of Australian assets to overseas investors. If such factors were
considered, the current account norm might be for a deficit larger than 1 percent of GDP. The NFA stabilizing
deficit is closer to 2½-3 percent of GDP. Our assessment is therefore that the current account gap is in the range of
-2 to 0 percent of GDP.
2/ The EBA REER regression approach, and the EBA REER level regression provide estimates of a gap
encompassing a wide range from 5 to 15 percent in 2016.

Potential policy responses:
If growth remains on the weak side, or
commodity prices fall further driven by
weaker global demand conditions,
further monetary accommodation
would be warranted.

Background. Australia has a high negative net international investment position (NIIP) of -63 percent of GDP (as of
mid-2016). The ratio has varied in a range between -40 and -60 percent of GDP since 1988. Liabilities are largely
denominated in Australian dollars while assets are in foreign currency. Foreign liabilities are composed of around
one quarter of FDI, one half of portfolio investment (principally banks borrowing abroad and foreign holdings of
government bonds), and one quarter of other investment and derivatives. With the current account deficit
expected to rise to its long run average of around 4 percent of GDP over the medium term, the NIIP to GDP ratio
would rise to around 68 percent of GDP.
Assessment. The NIIP level and trajectory are sustainable. The structure of Australia’s external balance sheet
reduces the vulnerability associated with its large negative NIIP. Since Australia’s NIIP liabilities are mainly in
Australian dollars and there is a net foreign currency asset position, a nominal depreciation tends to strengthen the
external balance sheet, all else equal. The banking sector has a net foreign currency liability position but it is fully
hedged. The maturity of banks’ external funding has improved since the global financial crisis, and even in a tail risk
event where domestic banks suffer a major loss, the government’s strong balance sheet position allows it to offer
credible support.
Background. Australia has run current account (CA) deficits for most of its history. Since the early 1980s, deficits
have averaged around 4 percent of GDP. In 2015, the deficit widened by 1¾ percentage points to 4.8 percent,
reflecting an unusually large decline in the terms of trade (iron ore prices fell by over 40 percent in 2015), stronger
domestic demand in Australia, and relatively weaker external demand. The current account deficit is expected to
narrow in 2016, partly reflecting the lagged effects of currency depreciation in 2014/15, which has boosted services
and non-resource exports, and new resource export capacity coming on stream. Over the medium term, the deficit
is expected to be around 4 percent of GDP, with a moderately larger trade deficit. However, with over half of
Australia’s exports going to emerging Asia, a key risk is a sharper than expected slowdown in China which could
result in a further sharp decline in commodities prices.
Assessment. Australia’s persistent CA deficits reflect a structural saving-investment imbalance with very high
private investment relative to a saving rate which is already high by advanced country standards. After accounting
for Australia-specific factors driving investment, the staff assessment is that the cyclically-adjusted current account
is some 0-2 percent of GDP below the level implied by medium-term fundamentals and desirable policy settings in
2015. This assessment is subject to uncertainty given that it depends on how non-oil commodity prices evolve. 1/
Background. The real effective exchange rate (REER) depreciated 7 percent in 2015 relative to its 2014 average. As
of June 2016, the REER depreciated by less than ½ percent compared to its 2015 averages. Compared to its thirtyyear average, the REER is some 14 percent higher. Continued substantial capital inflows and favorable interest rate
differentials may have contributed to the continued relative strength of the Australian dollar. Since mid-2015, the
currency has been broadly stable in real effective terms.
Assessment. Taking into account these factors including the attractiveness of highly rated Australian assets, staff
assesses the REER to be 0 to15 percent above the level implied by medium-term fundamentals and desirable policy
settings. 2/
Background. The mining investment boom has been funded predominantly offshore. Net FDI inflows into this
sector have partially offset the reduced need for the banking sector to borrow abroad. As investment in new
mining projects winds down, related demand for imports will decrease, buffering the impact on the overall balance
of payments. Australia also received large inflows in recent years into bond markets given its sound fiscal position
relative to other advanced economies, and owing to relatively high interest rate differentials.
Assessment. Credible commitment to a floating exchange rate and a strong fiscal position limit the vulnerabilities.

Impact
Domestic risks
M Business investment could recover
faster amid favorable financing conditions
and stronger terms of trade.
M Profits may remain under pressure for
longer with external disinflation, while
consumption growth could be weaker with
continued low wage growth and a higher
incidence of part-time work. Investment
would remain weaker as a result, hurting
medium-term growth prospects.
H A sharp housing market correction
would lower residential investment and
private consumption. A vicious feedback
loop of declining house prices, higher
non-performing loans, tighter bank credit,
and lower activity could amplify the
downturn.
External Risks
H A hard landing in China would lead to
lower growth and large commodity price
declines would lead to a major downturn
in Australia.

Policies to reduce impact
The Australian dollar would
likely appreciate; monetary
policy tightening if needed.
Monetary policy easing with
minor slowing; combined
monetary and fiscal policy
easing if economy hits the zero
lower bound.

Monetary policy easing; fiscal
policy stimulus; measures to
facilitate mortgage debt
restructuring, including selected
fiscal intervention.

Combined monetary policy and
fiscal policy easing as economy
could reach the zero lower
bound quickly; structural fiscal
measures to facilitate
adjustment in commodity
sectors and regions, including
active labor market policies
For temporary easing: monetary
policy easing; combined
monetary and fiscal policy
easing if economy hits the zero
lower bound. Structural reforms,
including fiscal ones, to raise
productivity.
Monetary policy easing;
combined monetary and fiscal
policy easing if economy hits
the zero lower bound.

Monetary policy easing;
combined monetary and fiscal
policy easing if economy hits
the zero lower bound.
Continued pursuit of open
market policies.
The exchange rate would likely
act as a shock absorber and
dampen the impact; monetary
policy response if needed.

Annex VII. Summary – Inflation Targeting in Australia:
Performance, Challenges and Strategy Going Forward
The Australian model of flexible inflation targeting has been a success, as evidenced by
average inflation consistent with the target, and a substantial moderation in inflation and output
volatility.
Belatedly, monetary policy in Australia has also faced some of the challenges that other
central banks have faced after the global financial crisis, albeit not to the same extent.


A slower-than-expected recovery, economic slack, and inflation declining below target in a
difficult global economic environment.



An increased probability of hitting the effective lower bound (ELB) on nominal policy rates, given
declines in the real equilibrium interest rate (EIR) and some possibly large downside risks (e.g.
China, European banks, geo-political uncertainty, etc.).



Risk of more persistent deviations of inflation below target (“low inflation trap”) and prolonged
slack.

Staff estimates of the real EIR in Australia suggest that it has declined from around two
percent in mid-2008 to around 1 percent over the past two years. The policy rate has been
below the equilibrium throughout most of the post-GFC recovery, indicating that monetary policy
has been in a ‘loose’ stance.
In the current situation, the prudent policy strategy would be a “low for longer” monetary
policy stance while preparing for coordinated monetary and fiscal policy easing if downside
risks were to materialize.


Around the current baseline outlook, a ‘prudent risk-management strategy’ would be to respond
more strongly to negative inflation and output surprises than to positive ones.



To lower risks of ‘dark corners’, an effective policy response would call for both expansionary
monetary and fiscal policies in the event that large negative shocks were to materialize (e.g.,
lower global growth and commodity prices).

Enhancing policy transparency

A more forecast-oriented communication policy which could include more explicit discussion of
how the RBA intends to use its policy instruments over time to bring inflation back to target.

Annex VIII. Summary – Australia’s Fiscal Framework: Issues and
Options for Reform
This paper reviews the Government of Australia’s approach to framing fiscal policy.


Trying to meet its objectives of stabilization, long-term sustainability, and support of
intergenerational equity. It aims for a medium-term balance anchor of 1 percent of GDP budget
surplus, on average, over the economic cycle and to control debt accumulation.



Amid long-term spending pressures from demographics – pensions, health care, aged care.

The analysis is based upon the use of the IMF’s model, G20MOD.


Comprises the entire world, with a block specifically for Australia. It models households, firms,
the government and the central bank, calibrated to match Australia’s macroeconomic and fiscal
characteristics.



The fiscal sector is fairly rich, with eight tax and spending instruments. Since government debt
levels help determine global interest rates, long-term net foreign asset holdings and real
exchange rates, fiscal policy plays a key role in both the short and long term.

Propose options for fiscal rules best suited to Australia to anchor fiscal policy.


Based on IMF work on fiscal rules (IMF, 2009, “Fiscal Rules – Anchoring Expectations for
Sustainable Public Finances,” IMF Staff Paper, December, 2009), with some of the methodology
derived from the Canada 2014 Article IV paper (Kinda, 2014, “Anchoring Sustainable Fiscal Policy:
A New Fiscal Rule in Canada,” in Canada: Selected Issues, IMF Country Report No. 15/23)

Short-term budget repair to achieve the medium-term balance anchor. The analysis shows that
the Government should be cautious about the pace of budget repair.


There is uncertainty on the required magnitude for budget repair.



Relies on rebalancing away from the domestic to external sector, which may not be a desirable
choice of fiscal authorities at this juncture.



It can be very costly under the primary risk of the “new mediocre.”

Implement a long-term debt anchor to provide a stronger long-term fiscal framework.


To achieve and maintain this, we propose an appropriate mix from three types of fiscal rules:



An expenditure rule limiting spending growth from 2021-2030—quantifies existing government
commitment to reduce the size of government and harks back to expenditure rules used in the
past;



Medium-term balance anchor (a flexible budget balance rule)—this is the target currently in
force;

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

51

AUSTRALIA



Different configurations of debt rules – both strict and flexible, achieving a new debt target over
either a 5- or 10-year horizon.

Compare strengths of the long-term debt anchor and the medium-term balance anchor.


Both targets have to be met on average over the economic cycle (a degree of flexibility that is
already present in the existing medium-term balance anchor) and communicated clearly through
various vehicles such as the annual budget and the mid-year updates.



A long-term debt anchor provides certainty about the level of the debt and its role in anchoring
households’ and firms’ behavior.



A long-term debt anchor provides greater stability for real GDP in both temporary and
permanent shocks relative to a medium-term balance anchor.

The paper analyzes three different debt rules. It examines an example consolidation of 10
percent of debt under the benchmark scenario as well as a couple of possible alternatives – stronger
aggregate demand and a boom-bust cycle driven by the terms of trade.


A preferred mixed rule strategy combines an expenditure rule with the flexible debt rule aiming
to reduce the debt over 10 years assessed against a number of stabilization and debt-control
related indicators.



The analysis also demonstrates that clear communications will ease the transition for the
implementation of rule against the background of long-term spending pressures from
demographics.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision is adequate for surveillance. Australia has subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination
Standard (SDDS) since April 1996, and its metadata are posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards
Bulletin Board (DSBB). Australia implemented all the recommendations of the first phase of the G-20
Data Gaps Initiative (DGI), with the exception of semi-annual reporting of Coordinated Portfolio
Investment Survey (CPIS) data. Australia also participates in the second phase of the DGI but has no
plans to adhere to the SDDS Plus. In recent years, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) has taken
several initiatives to further improve the quality of the data, such as issues relating to seasonal
adjustment of unemployment and employment statistics. Adding monthly inflation data to the suite of
statistics would assist surveillance.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on Australia
February 3, 2017
1. This supplement summarizes the main developments since the staff report was issued on
January 18, 2017. The developments are consistent with the analysis and assessment
presented in the staff report, and do not require a change in the staff appraisal.
2. Consumer price inflation was broadly unchanged in the fourth quarter of 2016. Headline
CPI rose by 0.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, unchanged from the third quarter.
On a year-on-year basis, it rose by 1.5 percent, up from 1.4 percent. Core CPI rose by
0.4 percent against the previous quarter and 1.6 percent compared to the same quarter a year
ago, up from an annual rate of 1.5 percent in the previous quarter.
3. The unemployment rate increased to 5.8 percent in the last quarter of 2016, from
5.6 percent in the previous quarter. This increase reflected a combination of faster labor force
growth and slightly lower employment growth compared to developments in the previous
quarter.
4. The terms of trade improved by 19.0 percent against the previous quarter, compared to an
expected improvement of 7.0 percent. The stronger outcome largely reflected stronger coal
and iron prices. However, spot prices for these commodities have started to decline recently
as expected, partly reflecting increased domestic supply in China.

Statement by Christine Barron, Alternate Executive Director for Australia
and Christopher Stewart, Advisor to Executive Director
February 3, 2017

The Australian economy continues to perform well in the face of one of the largest terms of
trade adjustments in its history. Despite global economic headwinds and the transition
underway to broader sources of growth following the mining investment boom, the
economy is expected to grow at around trend supported by a flexible exchange rate,
adaptive macroeconomic policies and strong institutional arrangements. But challenges
remain as Australia experiences some of the symptoms of the ‘new mediocre’, in particular
low business investment. The authorities have introduced policies to support business
investment and they remain committed to trade, foreign investment and immigration for
future economic growth.
Recent developments and outlook
After 25 years of continuous growth, the economy is forecast to grow in line with
potential, at about 2¾ per cent. This is a significant achievement given the challenges
associated with adjusting to the size of both the terms of trade boom and subsequent decline
and amid weak global growth. The unemployment rate has trended down over recent years
to stand at 5.8 per cent, around only half a percentage point or so above the nonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment, while the authorities estimate the output gap to
be of a similar magnitude. While GDP contracted by 0.5 per cent in the September quarter
2016, this was heavily influenced by a confluence of one-off factors and the economy is
forecast by both the authorities and the IMF to continue to grow in 2017. Over the longer
term, the authorities appreciate that productivity growth will be vital for improving living
standards in the face of any decline in the terms of trade and modest wages growth.
The baseline outlook is for a continued gradual recovery as the economy transitions
from a mining investment boom to broader sources of growth. The majority of the
decline in mining investment has already occurred, and non-mining investment has begun
to grow, albeit slowly. Resource exports are expected to contribute strongly to growth as
mining production ramps up following a decade of strong mining investment. Tourism and
education service exports are increasing in response to the depreciation in the exchange rate
since the peak in the terms of trade in late 2011. Economic activity is also expected to be
supported by an increase in public infrastructure investment at both federal and state levels
of government. Strong growth in dwelling construction in response to lower interest rates
and firm population growth is expected to taper off.
Underlying inflation has been running at about 1½ per cent and is forecast to gradually
rise over the next 1-2 years. Longer-term inflation expectations appear well anchored.

2
Growth in wages appears to have stabilised, although at low rates, and is expected to pick up
gradually over the next couple of years, in line with further improvements in the labour
market.
The authorities largely agree with staff that while the balance of risks has improved, it
is still tilted to the downside. A deterioration in the external sector resulting from adverse
economic or political developments in larger economies is seen as a particular risk, but not
one that the authorities can respond to in a more proactive manner than the policy settings
already in place. Domestically, there remains uncertainty about the pace of the pick-up in
non-mining business investment. Apparent risks in the housing market are currently
manageable. While some segments of the overall market are experiencing rapid price gains,
credit growth is not unusually strong, and the Australian household sector as a whole has
built significant mortgage buffers. The authorities also agree that there is the potential for a
large external shock to interact with, or even trigger, domestic risks.
Fiscal Policy
The authorities welcome the IMF’s confirmation of the current timetable to return the
budget to surplus and note only small differences in path profiles. The average annual
pace of fiscal consolidation across the forward estimates is 0.5 per cent of GDP. To the
extent that there have been weaker-than-planned budget outcomes over recent years, both
staff and the authorities agree that these have reflected weaker-than-expected nominal
growth leading to weaker-than-expected revenue, rather than a policy easing. Expenditure
growth has slowed, consistent with the commitment to repair the budget by controlling
expenditure.
Restraining recurrent spending creates room for productive spending. The authorities
have a strong commitment to supporting jobs and growth through boosting
infrastructure, innovation and investment while also rebuilding fiscal buffers. The
Federal Government is, for example, investing a record $50 billion in national infrastructure,
including in the National Broadband Network, the biggest infrastructure project in
Australia’s history. State Governments, which have predominant responsibility for
infrastructure in Australia, have also increased infrastructure investment. Private investment
will be encouraged through a lowering of the corporate tax rate – starting with tax reductions
for small businesses – while average wage earners will remain in lower tax brackets longer
through adjustments to the personal income tax thresholds.
If large downside risks materialize, the authorities will continue to take a flexible
approach, prudently supporting the economy while also adhering to a longstanding
medium-term fiscal framework of achieving budget surpluses, on average, over the
cycle. The flexibility of the economy means that there is less benefit, and more room for
error, in trying to ‘fine tune’ the economy through minor adjustments to fiscal settings. The
authorities question the Staff’s suggestion that infrastructure investment be used for short-

3
term aggregate demand management, given the lags involved. Instead, the focus is on public
and private investment in infrastructure to contribute to higher potential growth.
The authorities welcome the Staff’s discussion of options for reform of Australia’s
fiscal framework and the suggestion that a long-term debt anchor could strengthen
the current fiscal framework. Australia has benefited considerably from its longstanding
commitment to maintain a budget surplus, on average, over the course of the economic
cycle. Australia has also benefited from its regular Intergenerational Reports that assess
long-term fiscal sustainability. The Commonwealth Government aims to stabilize and then
reduce net debt over time – currently it is expected to peak at about 19 per cent of GDP in
2018-19 before declining to around 10 per cent in 2026-27 – although the uncertainties
involved in policymaking mean that care is necessary to avoid policy becoming too
constrained by using a rigid debt anchor. Together, the existing tools support a long-term
disciplined approach towards fiscal policy that is necessary for a capital importing country
which generally runs current account deficits.
Monetary Policy
Monetary policy remains accommodative and supportive of economic growth. The
decline in inflation in Australia has been much more recent and much more modest than in
other advanced economies and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored. As
such, while the neutral cash rate has declined somewhat, monetary policy has ensured that
finance remains readily available to creditworthy borrowers, supporting dwelling
construction and providing a platform for business investment. The RBA’s flexible
inflation- targeting framework ensures that it remains well placed to respond to future
developments.
The RBA will consider staff’s suggestion of lengthening its forecast horizon in monetary
policy statements to help clarify its projections for longer-term inflation. More generally,
the RBA will continue to ensure that the public understands its reaction function, allowing
them to form their own views on the potential path of interest rates.
Financial system
The Australian financial system remains in good shape in terms of both its resilience
to shocks and its ability to support real economic activity. Resilience has increased
over recent years. Banks have improved their capital buffers, with the weighted average
CET-1 capital ratios of the four largest Australian banks moving into the upper quartile of
international peers on a comparable basis (at about 13.5 per cent as at December 2015).
Banks are expected to steadily accumulate further capital as the Australian Prudential
Regulation Authority continues to finalise its assessment of what constitutes
‘unquestionably strong’ capital positions. The banks have also improved their liquidity
profiles by increasing the share of stable funding, including by sourcing more funds from
domestic deposits and longer-term debt. Indeed, of those authorized deposit-taking

4
institutions that are subject to the net stable funding ratio (NSFR), most already appear to
broadly meet the minimum requirements which come into effect in 2018. The banks are
working to maintain their profitability through an increased focus on simplifying their
businesses and cutting costs, with the major banks’ return on equity currently about 14 per
cent.
Lending standards will remain under scrutiny given APRA’s intensive and risk-based
approach towards supervision. There has been increased attention on reinforcing sound
lending standards in response to developments in some segments of the property market.
Furthermore, the riskiness of existing housing loans continues to be somewhat mitigated by
the sizable mortgage buffers that borrowers have built by maintaining their debt repayments
above required repayments as interest rates fell. More generally, the Council of Financial
Regulators will continue to monitor potential risks and take additional steps if necessary.1 In
this regard, however, the motivation behind the authorities’ actions is to improve the
resilience of the economy, not to influence housing prices. They will also continue to
carefully monitor commercial property lending and are working to finalize legislation to
further improve their crisis management and bank resolution toolkit, in line with the
recommendations of the Financial System Inquiry accepted by the Government.
The structure of Australia’s net external liabilities largely mitigates any potential
macro-financial vulnerability. Australia’s current account deficit continues to reflect that
Australia’s strong investment outcomes are not able to be fully met by domestic savings.
Furthermore, while Australia has a net foreign liability position, it has a net foreign
currency asset position, given that the bulk of foreign liabilities are denominated in, or
hedged back into, Australian dollars. Indeed, despite the cost, the banking sector not only
hedges its foreign currency liabilities but does so in a way that matches the duration of its
hedges with the underlying liabilities. Finally, the current account deficit is expected to
remain towards the low end of the range in which it has fluctuated over recent decades,
and net foreign liabilities have been stable as a share of GDP over the past decade.
Structural Reforms
The authorities appreciate the importance of further reforms to boost productivity
growth. With the terms of trade unlikely to return to its previous highs, improvements
in productivity are essential to invigorate growth in living standards. Further reform is
also important to create the conditions for stronger private investment as the weakness in nonmining investment is an aspect of the “new mediocre” that is most evident in Australia.

The Council of Financial Regulators is the coordinating body for Australia’s main financial regulatory agencies.
It comprises the Reserve Bank of Australia, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, the Australian
Securities and Investment Commission, and The Treasury

5
The authorities welcome Staff’s message that the reform agenda is appropriately
focused on fostering innovation and competition. The National Innovation and Science
Agenda will play a key role in supporting investment, innovation and enterprise, with its
effectiveness underpinned by annual assessments. The first tranche included changing
funding arrangements for some government services; the second tranche may focus on
improving critical science capabilities and business investment in innovation. With regards
to taxation reform, this was the focus of comprehensive analysis and national debate in 2015
and 2016, the outcome of which was a focus on lowering the corporate tax rate and
adjustments to personal income tax brackets to ensure average wage earners remain in lower
tax brackets for longer.
Heightened competition will be supported by the implementation of recommendations
from the Harper Review into competition policy, including introducing competition,
contestability and consumer choice in the provision of (largely publicly provided) human
services. The Government has also initiated specific inquiries into the efficiency of the
superannuation industry as well as competition in the financial system. This is on top of the
changes to the financial system coming out of the Government accepting all but one of the
recommendations from the Financial System Inquiry. More broadly, the Productivity
Commission has been tasked with undertaking regular reviews of the nation’s productivity
performance.
Australia remains firmly committed to an open economy in trade, foreign investment
and immigration. Australian policymakers understand that it is in Australia’s national
interest to stay the course and continue liberalizing trade. Australia remains well placed to
benefit from its diversification and integration into Asia, and continues to benefit from
recent FTAs with China, Japan and South Korea. In addition, Australia is developing new
multilateral and bilateral free trade agreements with major trading partners.
