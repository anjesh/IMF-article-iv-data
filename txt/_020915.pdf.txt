REPORT ON DELAYED ARTICLE IV CONSULTATIONS

Note: Taxonomy of the Reasons for Delays of Article IV Consultations
Article IV consultations are delayed for a variety of reasons. For the purpose of monitoring delays,
Fund staff groups the reasons into the following categories. It should be recognized, however, that a
delay may have more than one reason.


Program-related issues: Delayed (i) in order to combine the consultation with a request for
use of Fund resources (UFR) or Policy Support Instrument (PSI), or program review; or (ii) due
to ongoing discussions on UFR or PSI, or continued work on program review.



Further discussions: Delayed due to further discussions with the authorities on economic
developments and policies.



Political/security situation: Delayed due to the unsettled political and/or security situation.



Government change: Delayed due to forthcoming or recent elections, change of government,
or changes within government.



Staffing constraints.



Authorities’ request: Delayed at the request of the authorities due to, for example, their
inability to host the mission as a result of their work schedule.



No agreement on mission dates/modalities: There was no agreement on the modalities for
the mission/the authorities have not communicated dates for the Article IV consultation
mission.



Miscellaneous: Includes reasons not accommodated above.
