EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Political stability and prudent economic management continue to contribute to a
significant rise in living standards and development indicators in Bhutan. Significant
political changes are in the offing, but the authorities are taking steps to ensure the continuation
of sound policies. Bhutan’s economic prospects are bright. Construction of two hydropower
projects will help sustain real GDP growth over the medium term. With the exchange rate peg to
the Indian rupee, inflation is expected to be in line with price developments in India. The overall
balance of payments is projected to be in surplus and would help maintain adequate international
reserves.
The authorities are aware of the risks and challenges going forward. Near-term risks relate
mainly to a (temporary) decline in official rupee reserves to critical levels. In addition, there is a
potential for “Dutch disease” type overheating and exchange rate appreciation with full
commissioning of Tala. Other risks and challenges relate to continued rapid credit growth and
vulnerabilities in the banks’ balance sheets and concerns about debt sustainability, as power
projects in the pipeline begin. With a rapidly growing labor force and limited public sector
absorption capacity, policy measures are required to foster private sector job creation.
Key Policy Recommendations
The Royal Monetary Authority (RMA) needs to remain watchful of excess liquidity,
credit growth and financial sector soundness. Mopping up excess liquidity requires
stepped up issuance of RMA bills and an increase in the CRR ratio. There is also a need to
limit financial institutions’ balance sheet exposures to factors that pose a potential risk of
higher NPLs, by developing markets in financial instruments to manage liquidity in the short
run and provide alternative investment vehicles for financial institutions over the medium
term. The RMA needs to enhance its financial sector supervision and build capacity in
monetary and foreign exchange reserve management.
The exchange rate peg to the Indian rupee and the level of the peg remain appropriate.
Close trade and other links with India generate significant benefits for the Bhutanese
economy and help to anchor inflation expectations. Should they arise, some fiscal tightening
would help alleviate real exchange rate appreciation pressures, when Tala comes on stream.
Competitiveness can be enhanced by raising private sector efficiency and lowering costs.
Fiscal sustainability requires limiting domestically financed deficits and mobilizing
external aid. While the public debt-to-GDP ratio moves along the power sector cycles,
maintaining the debt ratio on a downward trajectory requires that domestically financed
deficits be limited by mobilizing external aid and planning expenditures in a medium-term
framework. Broadening the tax base and better administration can increase revenue.
To foster private sector growth and generate employment opportunities, policy
measures are required. The main areas are aligning the education system to market needs,
further streamlining the regulatory regime, liberalizing the trade regime, implementing
financial sector reforms, and investing in infrastructure to lower nonlabor costs. In the
financial sector, the revised RMA Act, Financial Institutions Act, and Foreign Exchange
Regulations should be adopted early in 2008.

4
I. BACKGROUND AND MACROECONOMIC SETTING
1.
Bhutan is at the cusp of significant political changes again after almost a decade
of carefully managed reforms. In December 2006, King Jigme Singye Wangchuk abdicated
in favor of crown prince Jigme Khesar Namgyal Wangchuk. Political parties are now being
formed and mock elections have been held. National Assembly elections are scheduled for
early 2008. The new parliament will debate and pass Bhutan’s first written constitution.
These changes follow political reforms started in 1998, when King Jigme Singye Wangchuk
devolved executive powers to a cabinet of ministers chosen by the National Assembly.
2.
To secure a legal basis for the continuation of sound policies, the National
Assembly has passed a number of legislative measures. These include a Public Finance
Act, Audit Act, Labor Act, and an umbrella Environment Protection Act. Steps have also
been taken to firmly establish the rule of law, such as setting up of the Office of the Attorney
General and passage of Anti-Corruption legislation. However, other key economic
legislation, such as a revised RMA and Financial Institutions Acts and Foreign Exchange
Regulations, will have to await the formation of a new government after the 2008 elections.
3.
Political stability and prudent economic management have contributed to a
significant rise in living standards and development indicators. Real GDP growth
averaged 7 percent during 1997/98−2006/07, raising per capita GDP to around US$1,400.1 2
Social indicators have also registered an appreciable improvement and Bhutan appears to be
on track to meet several of its Millennium Development Goals.

significantly shape the macroeconomic outlook. Work on the proposed power stations is
expected to begin in 2007/08, would require almost a decade for construction and
commissioning, and yet another decade or more for debt repayment thereafter.3
5.
Three key features of the Bhutanese economy are embedded in the hydropower
cycles. First, the need for an extended horizon to assess fiscal and project sustainability given
the long duration of hydropower cycles. Second, India’s role as Bhutan’s principal trading
partner, sole purchaser of electricity exports, and largest donor/lender for hydropower
projects. Third, the high ratio of external aid to GDP and domestic revenues (together with
the high aid and revenue volatility) require careful, medium-term planning.

remained in line with price developments

7.
Large shifts in the fiscal position
reflected a combination of revenue,
expenditure, and aid volatility.
In 2005/06, a delay in excise duty refunds
from India was more than offset by higher
grants and lower capital spending. The
budget made a net repayment to the
banking system of ¾ percent of GDP.

Four power sector projects are currently operational (Tala, Chukha, Kurichu, and Basochu). The RGB is
planning four new projects. Construction for Punatsangchu I (1095 MW) and Dagachu (114 MW) will start
in 2007/08. The projected cost is 165 percent and 15 percent of 2007 GDP, respectively. Punatsangchu I is to be
financed by India; Dagachu is to be financed by Austria, AsDB, and RGB. Punatsangchu II (992 MW) and
Mangdechu (672 MW) are in preliminary stages of conception. See selected issues, Chapter I, “Managing the
Macroeconomic Impact of the Hydropower Sector.”

6
In 2006/07, the domestically financed deficit (2 percent) was higher-than-budgeted
(1½ percent of GDP). The main factors were a revenue shortfall (again from a delay in excise
duty refunds from India), higher-than-budgeted spending, and lower-than-budgeted loan
inflows.4 In particular, public infrastructure spending is on the rise to mark a century of the
monarchy, coronation of a new king, and the first elected national parliament in 2008.
8.
Although the public debt-to-GDP ratio rose, debt service obligations remained
manageable. Public debt doubled to over 80 percent of GDP at end-2005/06 from mid-2000.
The bulk of the increase was rupee borrowings from India for Tala. The purchase of an
aircraft at a cost of about US$39 million (4½ percent of GDP) for state-owned Druk Air also
contributed to the increase in the public debt ratio. However, with debt service payments on
Tala scheduled to begin only in 2007/08, the debt service ratio remained around
6(10) percent of exports (revenue) during the past five years.
9.
While the balance of payments remained in surplus and total international
reserves rose, the composition of reserves became unbalanced. The trade balance
improved in 2005/06, as exports to countries other than India rose significantly. In 2006/07,
electricity exports from Tala shifted the trade balance into a small surplus. Together with a
projected surplus in the capital and financial account related to continued disbursements for
Tala and other external assistance, the total reserve cover (convertible currency and Indian
rupees) at end-2006/07 was over nine months of goods and services imports. However, the
level of rupee reserves fell to ½ month of (rupee) imports at end-2006/07.
10.
The decline in rupee reserves to uncomfortable levels was associated with a
combination of factors.
•

For a number of years, the financial system has witnessed excess liquidity and
rapid private sector credit growth.5 Private sector credit growth has averaged
around 30 percent per year during the last seven years. This rapid credit growth has
been facilitated by a number of factors: balance of payments surpluses, excess
liquidity in the financial system, institutional and policy changes, strong credit
demand, and limited alternative investment avenues (real and financial) for the
commercial banks. With a large fraction of the imports coming from India, the credit
growth has contributed to high import growth. Notwithstanding this expansion,
excess liquidity in the banking system persists. Moreover, the distribution of excess

liquidity is skewed towards one commercial bank, which holds the bulk of RGB and
government corporations’ deposits.6
•

In 2006/07, aid inflows from India fell, interest rate spreads with India widened,
and public infrastructure spending rose. Large Tala-related aid inflows from India
tapered off sharply in late 2006. At the same time, public infrastructure spending is
on a rising path. Moreover,

reserves shortfall, the RMA secured a rupee line of credit with an Indian commercial
bank against its convertible currency deposits.

11.
Rapid private sector credit growth has implications for financial sector
soundness indicators. The bulk of private sector credit (36 percent of total outstanding at
end-2006) was extended for housing, although credit to the manufacturing and tourism
sectors appears to be picking up. With this, the exposure of the financial institutions to the
housing sector further increased, even as the ratio of NPLs to total loans fell, exacerbating
potential risks going forward should there be a bust in real estate prices.

III. OUTLOOK, RISKS, AND CHALLENGES
12.
Bhutan’s economic prospects are bright. Construction of hydropower stations
Punatsangchu I and Dagachu will shape the Tenth Five-Year Plan (2008/09−2012/13). Real
GDP growth is projected to average about 7 percent, as electricity exports to India from
current and prospective projects should provide a fairly stable source of growth. Neighboring
Indian states are energy deficient, tariff rates have been negotiated upwards between
Bhutanese and Indian governments periodically, and supply side disruptions in the past due
to climatic or technical reasons have only been temporary. On the balance of payments, trade
and current account deficits are projected starting 2009/10, as debt service payments for Tala
begin in 2007/08 and imports for new power projects pick up thereafter. These deficits are
offset by adequate aid flows to help maintain the overall balance of payments in surplus, and
international reserves are projected at 9−11 months of goods and services imports.
13.

These favorable prospects mask potential risks, and challenges remain.

•

Near-term risks relate mainly to the decline in official rupee reserves to critical
levels. In addition, there is a potential for “Dutch disease” type overheating and
exchange rate appreciation with the full commissioning of Tala.

•

The medium term poses other potential risks and challenges. Spikes in economic
activity associated with power sector projects (as in the case of Tala) could spill over
to other sectors, including through demonstration effects of government wage
increases, and undermine external competitiveness. Continued rapid credit growth
concentrated in the housing sector raises concerns over vulnerabilities in the banks’
balance sheets. Concerns about debt sustainability are likely to reemerge, as power
projects in the pipeline begin. Finally, the poverty rate is still high, especially in the
rural areas and in the less developed Eastern region. With limited absorption capacity
of the public and power sectors, private sector development is key to job creation to
absorb a young, rapidly growing labor force and to generate a durable reduction in
poverty.
Box 1. Poverty in Bhutan

Poverty in Bhutan is high despite significant increases in real per capita income. The RGB’s 2004
Poverty Analysis Report estimated that 32 percent of the population was poor (national poverty line of
Nu. 740 per month or US$17). Poverty incidence is more severe in rural areas (38 percent), in the less
developed Eastern region (50 percent), and in larger households in agriculture with less educated members
and fewer assets (land, livestock, and equipment). Other proximate causal factors include remote location
and difficult terrain, lack of wage employment, and limited access to social and economic services,
including credit. The Poverty Analysis Report estimates that it would take more than 15 years for the
severely poor to exit from poverty assuming sustained real per capita income growth of 4 percent and
unchanged income distribution.

9
IV. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
14.
Against this background, the principal policy issues addressed in the
consultation discussions were: (i) monetary, reserves and exchange rate management;
(ii) risks to financial sector soundness; (iii) fiscal sustainability; and (iv) structural reforms
for job creation and private sector development. On the overall direction over the medium
term, the authorities maintained that economic policies are expected to remain broadly
unchanged as Bhutan makes its historic transition to constitutional monarchy and
parliamentary democracy, balancing growth and poverty alleviation with protection of the
country’s cultural heritage and environment. The policy and development priorities are
broadly shared, both at the central level and at the grassroots, with the civil service providing
continuity in implementation.
A. Monetary, Reserves and Exchange Rate Management
15.
The authorities agreed that monetary conditions need to be tightened to shore
up rupee reserves and manage pressures on the exchange rate peg.
•

The authorities viewed the rupee reserves shortfall as temporary. Staff agreed that the
shortfall would dissipate when aid inflows from India for the Puna I project resume
later in 2007. Should the need arise, the RMA could also sell convertible currency
reserves and secure additional rupee credit lines (preferably concessional ones).

•

There was broad agreement that the RMA needs to mop up excess liquidity in the
banking system through stepped up issuance of RMA bills and an increase in the
CRR ratio (which was reduced from 20 percent to 13 percent in 2004). Steps could
also be taken to slow down private sector credit creation, especially to the housing
sector by raising provisioning requirements for loans to the sector. Along the lines of
these discussion, the RMA is in the process of raising the CRR ratio to 15 percent.
More generally, monitoring pressures on the exchange rate peg requires that RMA
significantly upgrade its capacity to monitor, forecast, and manage rupee flows and
reserves, as well as domestic money market liquidity conditions, as suggested by IMF
technical assistance missions.

16.
There was agreement that the exchange rate peg to the Indian rupee remains the
appropriate nominal anchor and the level of the peg is also appropriate.
•

The peg has served Bhutan well given the close economic links with India and has
helped to anchor inflation expectations. These links are reflected in both the current
and capital accounts with India, through trade and aid.

10
•

The bilateral real exchange rate (RER) with India, which accounts for over 75 percent
of Bhutan’s trade, has fluctuated within a narrow band since 2003.7 The RER may
appreciate somewhat if a large part of the expansion in national income from Tala is
directed to nontradables. The impact

•

For the near term, staff suggested that some fiscal tightening, as needed, could also
help contain appreciation pressures. Over the medium term, productivity
improvements can help offset the impact of a real exchange rate appreciation, and the
onus should remain with the private sector to raise efficiency. The government should
remain focused on upgrading infrastructure rapidly, raising education and vocational
training levels, and creating an enabling environment to help reduce transportation
and transaction costs.

•

In assessing the appropriateness of the level of the peg, a number of considerations
point to broad internal and external stability. Current account deficits have been
appropriately financed by capital inflows (mostly concessional external aid) in the
past. Specifically, power sector

sector imports and other current
account outflows have been covered
by export earnings and other inflows, permitting a steady maintenance of an
international reserves cover at adequate levels (notwithstanding the temporary rupee
reserves crunch). Domestically financed deficits have been limited.

Bhutan does not produce monthly CPI data; quarterly CPI data has been published only since 2003Q2.

11
B. Risks to Financial Sector Soundness
17.
The RMA and financial institutions were aware of balance sheet risks that have
built up after sustained rapid credit growth. These risks include the existing high levels of
nonperforming loans (NPLs) in the two nonbank financial institutions, the potential for an
increase in NPLs in the commercial banks following a general downturn or a sectoral shock,
and interest rate risks from the maturity mismatch between commercial banks’ assets and
liabilities. Stress tests on the banking system balance sheets suggest that in the current
macroeconomic environment, the banks are subject to credit risk, especially through their
exposure to the housing sector, open net foreign asset positions, and the maturity mismatch
in their asset-liability positions (Box 2).
18.
The authorities intend to take steps to manage these risks. The RMA has directed
all financial institutions to increase the provisioning rate on substandard and doubtful loans
from 20 percent to 30 percent; the provisioning on housing loans in these categories is to be
raised from 50 percent to 60 percent, effective December 2007. These measures would also
help tighten liquidity and dampen private sector credit growth. In addition, quarterly
updating and refinement of the stress testing framework is to be undertaken, both as a
supervisory early warning system for the RMA and a risk management tool for the financial
institutions. Financial institutions are also committed to building their internal capacity to
monitor risk, especially credit risk. Addressing maturity mismatches in the financial
institution balance sheets would require creation of avenues for alternative portfolio
investments, including government bonds. As a first step, the RMA has drawn up proposals
for the introduction of 3-month and 6-month T-bills for budget financing to replace ways and
means advances from commercial banks.8
C. Fiscal Sustainability
19.
The 2007/08 budget may need to take offsetting measures to meet its financing
targets. Tala will induce a significant increase in GDP and increase the revenue-to-GDP
ratio. The full-year contribution of Tala to corporate income tax and dividends is estimated at
Nu. 2½ billion (4½ percent of GDP). Other nontax revenue and receipts are also set to
increase, although these contributions would be earmarked for debt service payments for
Tala. On the expenditure side, the budget provided for capital spending for infrastructure in
advance of centenary and coronation celebrations and formation of new constitutional bodies
in 2008. With the higher expenditure and somewhat lower grant inflows, the overall and
domestically financed deficit targets are set at 4 percent and 2¾ percent of GDP,
respectively. Although it is early to say how the budget would evolve during the fiscal year,

Box 2. Bhutan: Stress Tests of Banking Sector Soundness
The impact of various shocks on key banking system soundness indicators was quantified using a stresstesting framework. The shocks considered were: (i) a 25 percent increase in NPLs proportional to existing
NPLs; (ii) a 25 percent increase in NPLs proportional to performing loans; (iii) 25 percent of PLs in the
housing/construction sector becoming NPLs; and (iv) an appreciation of the ngultrum by 10 percent vis-à-vis
the U.S. dollar. The baseline risk-weighted capital adequacy ratio (CAR) for the banking system at end-2006
was 17 percent and the ratio of NPLs to total loans was 5 percent. Both banks met the prudential indicators,
but there were sizeable differences between their indicators and balance sheet characteristics.
The main results of the stress tests, relative to the baseline, are:
•

The CAR for the banks declines by varying amounts, but remains above the 8 percent required minimum
under all shocks. The range of the declines is 0.1–3¾ percentage points for the banking system as a whole.
The largest decline in the CAR comes, expectedly, from a 25 percent increase in the NPLs proportional to
performing loans.

•

The distribution of risk across the banks is varied. Bank 2 is more susceptible to a larger decline in its
CAR due to an exchange rate appreciation given its larger net open position; and to an increase in NPL
ratio in the housing/construction loans given its higher exposure to the sector.

•

The low existing level of interbank lending limits potential contagion among banks (and in the financial
sector more generally). Liquidity risks in the banking system are also currently limited.

These results are subject to caveats. The estimated decline in the CAR and increase in NPL ratio would be
higher if the required provisioning on the additional NPLs is higher. The financial soundness of the banks, as
reflected in NPL ratios, would also be worse if actual NPLs are higher than reported, if the initial classification
of loans is more optimistic than warranted, and if the down migration of loans is more severe. Additional data
on the maturity structure of assets and liabilities of the banks, and for nonbanks, would help complete the
picture on risks to financial sector soundness.

13
the authorities noted that an extended delay in the commissioning of the remaining turbines
at Tala could dampen its contribution to revenues. Similarly, overruns in capital spending on
the infrastructure projects currently under way could also generate a higher-than-planned
domestically financed deficit. Staff recommended that efforts be made to cut low-priority
spending to meet the budget financing targets should these events materialize.
20.
Over the medium term, the key fiscal challenge is to limit domestically financed
deficits while financing an ambitious public expenditure program. Discussions focused
on the Tenth Five-Year Plan (2008/09−2012/13), preparations for which were at an early
stage. The authorities noted that the plan would focus on reducing poverty, promoting
balanced regional development, enhancing private sector development, and expanding
infrastructure. Spending needs to achieve these objectives will be high. Staff recommended
that the medium term fiscal framework aim to achieve current surpluses and fiscal
sustainability by: (i) achieving an average annual revenue-to-GDP ratio of around
18½ percent (with higher revenue from Tala);9 (ii) containing average annual expenditure to
31 percent of GDP, roughly equally divided between current and capital spending;10 and
(iii) limiting domestically financed deficits to 1–2 percent of GDP. This is contingent on
external grants averaging 9 percent of GDP and (net) loans of 2½ percent of GDP. Staff also
recommended that contingency plans be made should external assistance (especially grants
and loans at concessional terms) fall below projected levels, and suggested a careful
reexamination of spending priorities to whittle down low priority projects.
21.
With this fiscal framework, the
public debt-to-GDP ratio follows the
power sector cycle. After a dip
in 2006/07, the ratio rises in 2007/08 as
accumulated interest during construction
(IDC) is added to the debt stock.11 Over
the medium term, significant repayments
for Tala would be offset by disbursements
for new hydropower projects, and the
public debt ratio is projected to peak in
2012/13. Thereafter, the public debt ratio

The revenue-to-GDP ratio declines over the medium term as: (i) no new power sector projects are expected to
come on stream over this period; (ii) the upward tariff revisions for existing hydropower projects take place
every five years, and do not provide sufficient buoyancy to revenues as GDP rises; and (iii) other revenue—the
bulk of which are receipts for making interest payments on power sector loans—decline significantly.
10

Capital expenditure in the budget excludes foreign financed spending on hydropower projects while revenues
and interest payments are included. A portion of Dagachu is to be financed by the RGB. Borrowings are
included in debt stock figures.

Interest payments on Tala debt were deferred during construction. The accumulated interest is to be

would decline with measurable increases in GDP as the new projects come on stream,
adequate external financing, and limited domestic financing. External debt service ratios are
projected to remain manageable, as external loans are expected to remain concessional in the
foreseeable future.
22.

Bhutan’s debt dynamics are sustainable, subject to a moderate risk of distress.

•

An analysis based on conventional indicators and stress tests—including the
breaching of some LIC-DSA thresholds—suggest that external debt dynamics should
be characterized as subject to a high risk of distress.12 13

•

However, there are strong mitigating factors.
¾ Bhutan’s own experience with construction, commissioning, and management of
large hydropower projects (which constitute the bulk of external debt) suggests
that there are mitigating factors, and the dynamics can be expected to be
sustainable. The loan repayments for the Chukha hydropower project will be
successfully completed in 2007/08 (almost twenty years after the commissioning
of the project in the mid-1980s).
¾ The key factor in the successful implementation of Chukha, and in the case of
other projects going forward, is Bhutan’s relationship with India, which provides
financing for these large projects. As part of this relationship, the two countries
maintain a close dialogue on the financial and technical aspects of the projects,
besides the wider dialogue on support for annual budgets and the five-year plans.

•

In light of Bhutan’s demonstrated successful management of large power projects in
the past and related strong mitigating factors going forward, characterization of debt
dynamics as subject to a moderate risk of distress is appropriate.

12

The overall NPV-to-GDP ratio is estimated at around 76 percent in 2006/07 (compared to the LIC-DSA
threshold of 50 percent for strong policy performers). The NPV of convertible currency external debt was
17¼ percent of GDP. The NPV of rupee debt (with 9 percent interest rate on Tala loans, and assuming a
standard discount rate of 5 percent) was about 60 percent of GDP, about 20 percentage points of GDP higher
than the face value, which does not include Tala IDC. Going forward, in the baseline scenario, the NPV-to-GDP
ratio falls as Tala comes fully on stream in 2007/08, rises as additional power sector projects commence, and
falls below the threshold as the additional projects come on stream. The NPV-to-revenue ratio follows a similar
path. The NPV-to-exports and debt service-to-exports ratios remain below the relevant thresholds over the entire
projection period until 2027/28.
13

Using an 11¼ percent discount rate, as in 2005 Article IV consultation staff report, the NPV of rupee debt is
estimated at 44 percent at end-2006/07, about 5 percentage points of GDP higher than the face value which does
not include Tala IDC. Adjusting for IDC and grant disbursements for Tala, the implied grant element for the
rupee debt is over 50 percent.

15
D. Structural Reforms for Sustained Growth and Poverty Alleviation
23.
The authorities are aware that the employment effects of the power sector
projects are limited, and that job creation requires implementation of the government’s
strategies in other sectors. The challenge is to overcome the constraints imposed by
Bhutan’s landlocked location, small size, and limited potential for diversification of
production and exports by exploiting tourism potential, strengthening infrastructure,
developing flexible labor and efficient credit markets, upgrading skills, and improving the
investment climate. To this end, the authorities are making efforts to implement structural
reforms, which foster private sector development and employment generation including
improvements in the regulatory environment, promotion of vocational training, and to
eliminate inconsistencies among legislation to improve prospects for tourism. In 2005, rules
and regulations for the revised FDI policy of 2002 were issued. In 2006, the Labor and
Employment Act was enacted, which contains provisions for occupational safety,
formalization of contractual employment arrangements, and a minimum wage. In addition,
the Bhutan Micro Trade Regulations were approved to streamline procedures for starting
retail and wholesale businesses.
24.
While acknowledging the high poverty rate, the authorities pointed to mitigating
and explanatory factors. They underlined that, in part due to formal state welfare policies
and informal social safety nets, abject poverty is virtually nonexistent. The poverty rate also
reflects the difficult terrain and sparse population, making provision of government services
more difficult and costly. The Tenth Plan would address these issues in a concerted manner.
The authorities agreed that while continued strong growth would help alleviate poverty,
active intervention is also needed. A key element of faster poverty alleviation is private
sector development. Targeted programs for the rural poor to increase land and labor
productivity are also required. Investments in social sectors—health and education—to
improve human capital and infrastructure to make market opportunities accessible to rural
and remote areas can make a significant dent on poverty.
25.
The authorities informed staff of their plans for trade liberalization. Bhutan aims
to join the WTO in 2008.14 The accession commitments to the WTO will provide a blueprint
for further trade liberalization. On the tariff structure, staff urged the authorities to reduce the
number of rates on imports from third countries and reduce dispersion by lowering
exceptional rates (of 50 percent and 100 percent).15

14

Bhutan joined the IFC in December 2003, and BIMSTEC (Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral
Technical and Economic Cooperation) in February 2004.
15

All imports from India are duty free.

16
26.
The authorities remain concerned about potential unsustainable net outflows of
hard currency reserves should they accept the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3,
and 4.16 They argued that sources of hard currency reserves are essentially limited to
unpredictable aid flows, and that easing the restrictions could lead to a significant shift in
imports from India to third countries and rapidly erode hard currency reserves to
unsustainable levels. Hence the need to limit demand from importers through a system of
case-by-case quantity restrictions. Staff noted that the current level of convertible currency
afforded room to experiment with eliminating the restrictions and considerably ease the
administrative burden. The authorities were open to cautiously experimenting with market
based instruments to manage the demand for convertible currencies, with Fund technical
assistance.
V. DATA ISSUES
27.
While data provision is adequate for surveillance purposes and efforts are being
made to improve the statistics, data shortcomings continue to hamper policy
formulation and implementation in some key areas. Fiscal data are not consolidated, and
large errors and omissions in the balance of payments preclude a more accurate assessment
of external flows. The data between the fiscal account and the monetary survey need to be
reconciled, in particular involving clear identification and classification of government
accounts in the banking system. The first modern population census was conducted in 2005.
VI. STAFF APPRAISAL
28.
Political stability and prudent economic policies have contributed to a steady
rise in per capita income in Bhutan. Prudent economic management and the successful
commissioning of a second large hydropower project in 2006/07 have contributed to robust
growth and a steady improvement in living standards for over a decade. Social indicators
have also registered an appreciable improvement. The political changes currently underway
in Bhutan would further broaden participatory democracy under a constitutional monarchy.
The prospect for a continuation of these policies, including the introduction of new
legislation, bodes well for Bhutan’s future as it stands poised for an historic transformation.
29.
Macroeconomic outcomes have remained favorable and Bhutan’s growth
prospects are bright. Real GDP and per capita income growth has been rapid over the last
16

Bhutan maintains exchange restrictions in connection with: (i) the availability of foreign exchange for travel,
invisibles, and private transfers; (ii) foreign exchange balancing requirements on remittances of income from
foreign direct investment; and (iii) the availability of foreign exchange for importers who have not provided
evidence that goods for which payments have been made were actually imported. Changes to Bhutan’s import
licensing rules in 2005, which introduced new foreign exchange balancing requirements for certain imports gave
rise to exchange restrictions subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Section 2(a). Bhutan also maintains
restrictions notified to the Fund pursuant to Decision 144−(52/51).

17
decade, powered by Tala. The new projects in the pipeline would maintain the growth
momentum. With the exchange rate peg to the Indian rupee, inflation should continue to
remain in line with price developments in India. International reserves are projected to
remain in a comfortable margin.
30.
Bhutan’s achievements have been significant, but risks and challenges remain.
Tala has contributed to strong growth in per capita income, but its capacity for job creation
has been limited. This is likely to remain true for the other power sector projects as well.
Sustaining balanced growth requires expansion of nonpower sectors, through structural
reforms which create an enabling environment for the private sector. In particular, the full
potential of the tourism sector can be further exploited within the imperatives of preserving
Bhutan’s cultural identity and environment. Moreover, while the absolute number is small,
the poverty ratio is high. Job creation and poverty reduction require significant infrastructure
spending, especially to improve road access, while maintaining a sound fiscal position. The
high ratio of external aid to GDP and domestic revenues, and aid and revenue volatility
underline the need for careful, medium-term planning.
31.
The RMA needs to remain watchful of excess liquidity, credit growth and
financial sector soundness. Further steps can be taken to mop up excess liquidity and curb
private sector credit growth. From a prudential standpoint, there is also a need to limit
financial institutions’ balance sheet exposures to sectoral and macroeconomic risk factors
which pose a potential risk of rising NPLs. A key element of limiting these risks is to
develop markets in financial instruments, including T-bills and government bonds, to manage
liquidity in the short run and provide alternative investment vehicles for financial
institutions. The RMA also needs to further enhance financial sector supervision, and build
capacity across a range of areas (especially monetary and foreign exchange reserve
management). Financial institutions also need to build capacity to monitor and manage
balance sheet risks.
32.
The exchange rate peg to the Indian rupee and the level of the peg remain
appropriate. Close trade and other links with India generate significant benefits for the
Bhutanese economy and help to anchor inflation expectations. To tide over the temporary
shortfall in rupee reserves and manage pressures on the exchange rate, monetary and fiscal
tightening would be appropriate in the near term. Monetary tightening would also help curb
private sector credit growth. Should there be an appreciation of the real exchange rate in the
aftermath of Tala coming on stream, the appropriate policy response would include some
fiscal tightening to moderate a rise in nontradable goods’ prices. More generally,
competitiveness can be enhanced by raising private sector efficiency and lowering costs.
33.
Fiscal sustainability requires limiting domestically financed deficits and
mobilizing external aid. While the public debt-to-GDP ratio moves along the power sector
cycles, maintaining the debt ratio on a downward trajectory requires that domestically
financed deficits be limited. This requires mobilizing external aid (grants and concessional

18
loans) on a timely basis and planning expenditures in a medium-term framework. In addition,
the buoyancy of revenues can be enhanced by broadening the tax base and better tax
administration, including through a rationalization of the sales tax and import duty rates.
External debt service obligations are sustainable. Together with the presence of mitigating
factors, even as some LIC-DSA thresholds are breached in NPV terms, this suggests a
moderate risk of debt distress. The Public Finance Act provides a welcome disciplining
framework for budget preparation, management, and execution.
34.
To foster private sector growth and generate employment opportunities, policy
measures are required. The main areas are aligning the education system to market needs,
further streamlining the regulatory regime, liberalizing the trade regime, implementing
financial sector reforms and investing in infrastructure to lower nonlabor costs. Even as the
new Labor Act seeks to balance contractual obligations and social protection, introducing a
private sector minimum wage at too high a level could contribute to unemployment,
especially among young labor force participants. In the financial sector, the revised RMA
Act, Financial Institutions Act and Foreign Exchange Regulations should be adopted early
in 2008.
35.
Staff urges the authorities to eliminate the restrictions subject to approval under
Article VIII as soon as possible, and to eliminate the restrictions maintained under
Article XIV as soon as Bhutan’s balance of payments position permits. Staff does not
recommend approval of the restrictions subject to Fund approval under Article VIII as the
authorities have not provided a timeframe for the elimination of these restrictions. The
convertible currency reserve position allows room to progressively do away these
quantitative restrictions. However, given the limited and unpredictable sources of convertible
currency inflows and justifiable concerns over the outflows, these steps would need to be
taken cautiously. The IMF stands ready to provide assistance in this area, including
development of a foreign exchange market and market-based instruments to manage hard
currency flows.
36.
While data provision for surveillance is adequate overall, policy analysis is
affected by shortcomings in certain key areas. Further improvements in upgrading fiscal
and external sector statistics should remain high on the authorities’ agenda.
37.

It is recommended that Bhutan remain on the 24–month consultation cycle.

1/ Debt service related to Tala starts in 2007/08. Tala debt disbursement is off budget, but debt service is channeled through budget.
2/ The shortfalls in taxes on domestic goods in 2005/06 and 2006/07 reflect delays in the refund of excises from India.
3/ Including Nu. 1.75 billion revenue from Tala in 2006/07 (delays in the commissioning of Tala reduced its contribution in 2006/07 by one-third
from full-year revenue expected at Nu. 2.4 billion). From 2007/08 on, when Tala becomes a corporation, its contribution appears in corporate
income tax and dividends.
4/ Including receipts from Tala for its interest payments.
5/ Including Tala's interest payment.
6/ The outturn for 2004/05 includes the purchase of one aircraft for Druk Air at a cost of 5 percent of GDP.
7/ In 2007/08 budget, the item does not subtract Tala amortization of Nu. 1,256 million. Subtracting this, net lending would be Nu. -1,654 million.
8/ Excluding Tala amortization payment of Nu. 1,256 million for 2007/08 budget.
9/ Incorporating Nu. 1 billion revenue shortfall from Tala owing to temporary technical problems, and lower debt service projection.

Bhutan is an IDA-only country and qualifies for 100 percent grants in FY07 because (i) the
ratio of the present value of external debt to GDP exceeds the threshold value of 50 percent,
and (ii) the ratio of the present value of external debt to exports is more than the threshold
value of 200 percent. Bhutan’s IDA allocation in FY07 and FY08 is about US$15.7 million
in each year, but as small state with a population of less than 1.5 million, Bhutan can
cumulatively frontload up to 80 percent of its overall IDA14 indicative allocation. The actual
allocation for FY08 and whether Bhutan will again qualify for grants will depend on a
number of factors, including country performance and the findings of a more complete debt
sustainability analysis.

World Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy
The 2005 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for the FY06/09 period aligns with Bhutan’s
distinctive vision of Gross National Happiness and the priorities and goals of the
9th Five-Year Plan (9FYP)/PRSP. The CAS emphasizes selectivity, and supports
development based on three pillars: (i) expanding access to better infrastructure and quality
social services, as well as connecting communities to markets; (ii) promoting private sector
development and employment; and (iii) strengthening the management of public resources,
as well as the monitoring and evaluation of development outcomes. In addition, the Bank will
support the Royal Government of Bhutan’s (RGoB) crosscutting efforts related to
decentralization, good governance and environmental management.
Lending Program
Building on a deepening engagement in several areas, there has been heightened activity in
the final six months of 2006/07, including over US$30 million in IDA grants committed or
about to be approved by the Board, and involving substantial frontloading of Bhutan’s
IDA14 allocation.
•

The US$10 million Second Rural Access Roads Project was approved by the Board
on April 10, 2007. The objective for the Second Rural Access Project is to improve
access for about 12,000 rural residents in several geogs (blocks of villages) of
Wangdue, Dagana, and Pemagtsel Dzongkhags, which have the highest demand for
access in Bhutan. The dzongkhags and geogs were selected taking into account:
(i) the development objectives set out in the Ninth Five-Year Development Plan;
(ii) the demand for access in the area and the road prioritization; (iii) the exclusion of
the selected geogs from projects supported by other donors; (iv) the cost-effectiveness
of the individual road; and (v) the detailed geotechnical survey of the individual
roads. The project includes two components: 1) a road access component, and 2) a
capacity development and implementation support component.

•

The proposed US$12 million Second Development Policy Grant was submitted for
Board consideration on June 20. It aims to carry forward the objectives of the first
operation, helping the RGoB: (a) enhance the delivery of public services by
strengthening fiscal management, (b) improve the effectiveness of public spending by
bettering financial management and procurement processes, (c) create better income
earning opportunities by improving the investment climate, facilitating greater labor
market flexibility, and increasing foreign direct investment, (d) raise educational
attainment, particularly in previously under served areas, by expanding access to high
quality education services, and (e) reduce maternal mortality by increasing the
number of births delivered in health facilities.

6
•

The proposed US$8 million Private Sector Development Project has also been
submitted for Board consideration on June 20, 2007. The project has three
components:
1) Development of IT/ITES Sector (US$5.0 million), focusing on the development
of the IT/ITES sector in Bhutan, using an integrated approach that includes: (i) the
establishment of an IT Park and related infrastructure, and (ii) the provision of IT
promotion services.
2) Development of IT/ITES Skills Program (US$2.0 million), focusing on the
development of skills through collaboration with international institutions at the
following three levels: (i) Generic Skills for the IT/ITES Sector; (ii) Distance
learning facilities/CMS for IT Skills development; and (iii) IT Entrepreneurship
Development Program.
3) Strengthening Financial Sector through IT Use (USD1.0 million), aiming at
improving efficiency in the financial sector through IT use, comprising the
following three activities: (i) IT system up gradation in the Bank of Bhutan; and
(ii) developing a ‘Financial sector IT development strategic plan’; and
(iii) establishing the Inter-bank Electronic Fund Transfer Clearing System at the
RMA.

•

A US$2.5 million National Influenza Preparedness and Response Project (Avian
Flu) is under preparation and is scheduled to be approved by the end of June 2007. As
it is funded from a global trust fund, it does not draw upon Bhutan’s IDA14
allocation. The overall objectives of the Project are to minimize the threat posed to
human beings in Bhutan by Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) infection by
preventing and controlling such infections among birds, especially domestic poultry,
and to prepare for, control, and respond to possible human infections, especially an
influenza epidemic and related emergencies.

Projects under preparation for FY2008 include the second Urban Development Project, and
the Government continues to implement projects with IDA financing to expand the rural
access road network and improve education outcomes.
Nonlending Program
The Bank continues to provide analytical and advisory services, aiming to help the
Government build capacity in the areas of: macroeconomic and fiscal analysis, public
expenditure management, financial management, procurement, private sector development
(through SEDF), statistics, and education quality. Several of these efforts are also supported
by grants:

7
•

A US$250,000 Trust Fund for Statistical Capacity Building grant became
effective on February 20, 2007. The objectives of the grant are to build statistical
capacity at the National Statistical Bureau in order to coordinate, consolidate and
harmonize data generation, and to facilitate poverty monitoring to produce concrete,
timely and useful information and analysis for decision makers. The project will
promote generation of user-friendly data which will underpin impact assessments and
monitoring and evaluation.

•

A US$287,000 Public Financial Management IDF Grant was approved in
April 12, 2007. The objective of the grant is to assist the Ministry of Finance and the
Royal Audit Authority of the Royal Government of Bhutan to strengthen the technical
and professional competence of the accounting and auditing staff and to improve its
operational capacity to produce and disseminate quality financial and audit reports
that meet international standards and serve the needs of the stakeholders.

•

A US$330,000 Multi-Year Rolling Budget IDF Grant was approved on
April 13, 2007. The development objective is to help the Royal Government of
Bhutan (RGoB) introduce Multi-Year Rolling Budgets (MYRB) (as called for in the
revised Financial Rules and Regulations of 2001), and move towards performance
budgeting. The MYRB initiative is a central part of the RGoB's efforts to ensure the
effective use of public resources.

International Finance Corporation (IFC)
Bhutan became a member of the IFC in 2003. The private sector in Bhutan is hampered by
the small size of the market, the lack of supportive infrastructure and the comparatively high
costs of doing business.
IFC Investment Services: IFC currently has US$9.4 million of senior debt outstanding in
one tourism project in Bhutan. IFC is close to exposure limits for Bhutan, so a maximum of
US$10−15 million of additional investment is envisaged over the next three years.
IFC Advisory Services: IFC-SEDF’s entry strategy has been to mark its presence in Bhutan
by replicating best practices to meet Bhutan’s growing and evolving needs; financial training,
gender development, and Knowledge Center initiatives are examples of these. In keeping
with the Bhutanese focus on maintaining cultural identity and environmental protection, the
principles of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) are integrated into all IFC-SEDF
programs.
Access to Finance (ATF) Program: IFC-SEDF’s ATF training programs have targeted
senior officials of the Royal Monetary Authority (RMA) and other senior bankers from
leading financial institutions such as Bank of Bhutan (BOB), Bhutan National Bank (BNB),

8
Bhutan Development Finance Corporation Ltd. (BDFC), and Royal Insurance Corporation of
Bhutan (RICB).
Business Enabling Environment (BEE) Program: IFC-SEDF’s BEE program is committed
to promoting a macro-conducive environment for SMEs in Bhutan. IFC-SEDF is currently
exploring specific interventions to simplify and improve business registration regulation
(e.g., reducing number of days required to register a business from 62 days to 47 days),
identify opportunities in regional and international markets for the exports of manufactured
and agro processed products (e.g., a “Supply Chain Study of Timber and Wood Products”
has been recently completed and gender empowerment through women BMOs, e.g., a pilot
project in partnership with National Women’s Association of Bhutan (NWAB) is presently
underway).
Investment Climate Assessments/Foreign Investment Advisory Service: Since 2000, FIAS
has undertaken a series of five small projects in Bhutan, each of which has been designed to
help RGoB take the next step in developing an operational framework for the introduction of
FDI into the economy for the first time. The first FIAS involvement was a desk review of an
early version of RGoB’s proposed “Foreign Investment Law”. Subsequently, a second
project helped with the drafting of an investment policy statement (IPS), the third project was
the preparation of drafting guidelines for FDI legislation to be issued as an Executive Order
(Foreign Direct Investment Policy) to provide a legal environment within which the country
could promote FDI. This led to the fourth FIAS project, comprising assistance to draw up
procedures to operationalize the Executive Order. A report was finalized in August 2004
which provided recommendations for an institutional structure within which the
administration of the FDI regime can be managed.
Future Vision: IFC-SEDF plans to extend its activities in Bhutan and replicate some of the
successful projects from the rest of the region. The projects would be designed in a manner
ensuring meaningful partnerships with Bhutanese counterparts and also keeping in mind the
socio-economic and cultural uniqueness of the country in mind.

ANNEX III: BHUTAN—RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
Bhutan became a member in 1982 and ADB began its lending operations to the country in
1983. Bhutan is classified under group “A” with full access to ADF and 80 percent
cost-sharing limit for project financing.
Consistent with the highest priorities identified in Bhutan’s National Poverty Reduction and
ADB’s Country Strategy and Program (CSP) approved in September 2005, the CSP has
two (2) strategic thrusts: (i) lending assistance focused on transport, power (including rural
electrification), urban development, and financial and private sector development; and
(ii) nonlending assistance for capacity building for sustainable development.
The CSP will be implemented in coordination with other development partners to avoid
duplication. Examples include ADB’s rural electrification loans following the Rural
Electrification Master Plan developed with assistance from the Government of Japan.
Similarly, development partners are using the Road Sector Master Plan developed with ADB
assistance. ADB has maintained close cooperation with other multilateral and bilateral
funding agencies in capacity building.
The indicative cumulative value for the period 2007−2008 is $37.6 million. One loan, for the
development of small and medium-sized enterprises, has been programmed for 2007, and
another, for rural electrification and renewable energy, is programmed for 2008. A
nonlending program with a cumulative value of $3.8 million has been programmed for
2007−2008.

ANNEX IV: BHUTAN—STATISTICAL ISSUES
While data provision is adequate, data shortcomings continue to hamper surveillance in some
key areas. For example, fiscal data suffer from lack of consolidation of government accounts
and lags in availability. In the balance of payments, large errors and omissions preclude a
more accurate assessment of external flows. The national income accounts, price and fiscal
statistics have significant limitations. Also, there are inconsistencies between monetary,
fiscal and balance of payments statistics. Moreover, the data are subject to frequent, and at
times substantial, revisions. The key factors contributing to the data deficiency are the
shortage of qualified personnel and facilities. The National Statistical Bureau (NSB) is also
constrained by the absence of a Statistics Act. The authorities recognize these shortcomings
and are working to remedy them with technical assistance from the ADB, IMF and others.
The March 2004 Multisector Statistics Mission assisted the authorities in preparing metadata
and plans for improving the macroeconomic statistics and sociodemographic indicators. An
official notification regarding Bhutan’s decision to participate in the GDDS is required in
order to formalize its participation in the system.
Real Sector
The national accounts compilation relies heavily on production data collected by line
ministries. These volume data often lack quality control. Estimates for manufacturing are
based mainly on annual data obtained directly by the national accounts section. Construction
data are estimated using both government accounts and the commodity flow method which
utilizes data on the supply of cement and logs. Expenditure components are derived from the
same data sources that are used in production estimates, with private consumption calculated
as a residual. In 2005, NSB started to report GDP at market prices, replacing the existing
estimate at factor cost. New estimates are available with significant lags and estimation
procedures are sometimes ad hoc. The base year was shifted from 1980 to 2000 on the basis
of Household Income Expenditure Survey in 2000. While new set of available data are added
for the estimation, there are still a number of potentially useful data sources that are not used
in the calculations. Some deflators, including the one for government services, are
inappropriate, causing bias in measures of output based on constant prices. Gross domestic
savings are defined as gross investment minus net capital inflow, but the latter concept does
not appear to correspond to either the balance on the trade account or on the current account.
Starting in 2004, the consumer price index (CPI) is compiled on a quarterly basis, the number
of commodity priced has been greatly expanded, and the geographical scope broadened.
A major constraint to compilations is the lack of reliable population data, both in terms of an
overall count and its age-gender distribution. Consequently, indicators of progress towards
the MDGs are not calculated on a systematic basis. The population census in 2005 revised
population estimates from over 2 million reported in International Financial Statistics (IFS)
to below 0.7 million.

11
Monetary Statistics
The balance sheets of the Royal Monetary Authority (RMA) and the two commercial banks
(the Bank of Bhutan and the Bhutan National Bank) are consolidated into a monetary survey.
The statistics are based on end month balance sheets prepared by these institutions and are
generally consistent with the Fund’s guidelines for the classification of monetary statistics.
There is, nevertheless, room for improvement in a number of areas, specifically: (i) the
valuation of financial assets is based on purchase price while market or market-price
equivalents would be preferable; (ii) to avoid misclassifications, a list of government units
and nonfinancial public enterprises should be prepared and shared with the reporting
financial institutions; (iii) the monetary accounts for the RMA and other deposits money
banks should be published in the Monthly Statistical Bulletin.
The timeliness and coverage data reporting to STA have improved. In addition to the regular
submission of monetary data published in the IFS, the RMA has also submitted monetary
data to STA using the Standardized Report Forms (SRFs).
The RMA website and Monthly Statistical Bulletin publish monetary and financial statistics
with one-month lag. The data include monetary survey, deposit liabilities of commercial
banks, sectoral credit by financial institutions, gross international reserves, exchange rates,
and selected interest rates. As of June 2007, the RMA reported monetary data to STA with a
two-month lag. The authorities and STA are working to improve the timeliness of data
reporting to STA to be in line with national publications.
Public Finance
Despite recent improvements in the quality of government finance statistics (GFS), the fiscal
data are subject to frequent and substantial revisions, particularly in the expenditure area. The
compilation and dissemination of budget execution data and GFS are very limited. Only
annual budget execution data are compiled and disseminated, but with a long lag. No GFS
are disseminated nationally. Sub-annual data on budget execution are not available. More
accurate revenue data could be compiled if there were closer coordination between the
various departments in the Ministry of Finance. There are inconsistencies between the fiscal
and monetary data with regard to bank financing, stemming from differences in the definition
of government.
External Sector
In recent years, particularly since 2002, efforts have been made to follow the classifications
recommended by the BPM5, to improve estimates of travel, other services, and transfers, and
to enhance consistency with other macroeconomic statistics, such as the GFS. But
weaknesses still remain. The balance of payments statistics cover a limited range of
transactions and many of the key data are estimated. The problem is partly associated with
the country’s unique exchange and trade system with India, as well as the large porous border

12
between the two countries, which gives rise to substantial unrecorded trade. No attempt has
been made so far to estimate the size of unrecorded trade between India and Bhutan, and
travel receipts and payments vis-à-vis India are based on assumption rather than on entry and
exit surveys of tourists. There are also a number of other limitations. Most importantly, trade
data are compiled on a calendar year basis, while other external transactions are compiled on
a fiscal year basis. Consequently, errors and omissions in the balance of payments
presentations are large and fluctuate widely.
A technical assistance mission in January-February 2005, in conjunction with RMA,
developed a plan for improvement in balance of payments statistics. It includes a quarterly
business survey, improved estimation methods, and increased timeliness. The RMA advised
that they plan to compile quarterly balance of payments data in the future. Following recent
improvements, Bhutan began supplying balance of payments data for publication in IFS in
June 2007.

BHUTAN
Joint IMF/World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis 20071
Prepared by the staffs of the International Monetary Fund and
the International Development Association
Approved by Matthew Fisher and Kalpana Kochhar (IMF)
and Vikram Nehru and Sadiq Ahmed (IDA)
September 20, 2007
External and public debt dynamics are assessed using the Low-Income Country Debt
Sustainability Analysis (LIC-DSA) framework. Debt ratios remain elevated in the coming
years due to additional hydropower projects. Notwithstanding the breach of some LIC-DSA
indicative thresholds, staffs’ assessment is that external debt dynamics are subject to a
moderate risk of distress. This assessment is made on the basis of the near absence of
commercial risk from Bhutan’s major energy projects and the high level of its foreign
exchange reserves in relation to external indebtedness.

since 2001/02, with Tala debt accounting for most of the increase.2 Domestic debt, all
denominated in local currency and held by domestic financial institutions, remains moderate.3

This is the first debt sustainability analysis prepared for Bhutan using the debt sustainability framework for
low-income countries developed jointly by the IMF and the World Bank. The DSA, produced jointly by Fund and
Bank staffs (Guidance Note available via the Internet: http://www.imf.org/external/np/pp/2007/eng/041607.pdf), is
based on external and public debt data from the Bhutanese authorities, and on IMF and World Bank staff estimates.

2
As for external debt, Indian rupee debt for the power sector amounted to 46¾ percent of GDP,
and convertible currency debt was about 30 percent of GDP.4
II. UNDERLYING DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS ASSUMPTIONS
2.
The baseline incorporates the impact of two additional hydropower projects
relative to the analysis in the 2005 Article IV consultation report.5 The DSA in 2005
Article IV staff report incorporated only the ongoing Tala project (1020 MW, financed
60 percent in grants, and 40 percent in loans with a 12-year maturity at 9 percent interest in
Indian rupees). The following analysis incorporates the Punatsangchu I and Dagachu projects.
The agreement for Puna I was signed in July 2007 with the Government of India (GOI). The
Government of Austria and the Asian Development Bank are to finance Dagachu, with equity
participation by the Royal Government of Bhutan (RGB).6 In addition, relative to the previous
analysis, the debt ratios have turned out to be more favorable due to better-than-expected fiscal
balances and upward revisions in the GDP series.
3.

Underlining baseline macroeconomic assumptions are as follows.

•

Real sector: Real GDP spikes as Tala comes on stream in 2006/07, and Punatsangchu I
is commissioned in 2016. The

Domestic debt data compiled by the Royal Government of Bhutan include fixed rate debt relating to the
purchase of one airplane for state-owned Druk Air in 2004/05, amounting to about half of total domestic debt.
Debt related to the second airplane purchase and other state owned enterprises are not included in the data.

4

Convertible currency debt includes US$9½ million commercial debt extended by the IFC, making all external
debt public or publicly guaranteed.

6

Punatsangchu II and Mangdechu are at early stages of conception and are not included in the projections.

Puna I’s project capacity will be 1095 MW. The financing terms are: 40 percent grant, 60 percent loan,
10 percent interest rate. The entire financing will be in Indian rupees. Dagachu will be 114 MW. The external
financing will be 75 percent in loans, at 7 percent. There is to be a 25 percent equity participation by the RGB.

3
raise the domestic revenue-to-GDP ratio. However, budgetary grants are expected to
moderate in absolute terms as national income rises.
•

External sector: Electricity exports jump when new power projects come on stream.
Strong import growth for hydropower construction and increased debt service
associated with Tala are projected. The current account deteriorates over the medium
term. In the long run, the power sector contributes to balance of payment surpluses.
New non-hydropower financing is assumed to have similar concessional terms as past
loans.

4.
The net present value (NPV) calculation assumes a standard five percent discount
rate for all loans. Debt service for Tala includes repayment of interest during construction
(IDC, which was deferred) but not interest on IDC.
III. EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
A. Baseline
5.
Power sector debt in Indian rupees shapes external PPG debt and debt service
dynamics. In NPV terms, the total and external public debt-to-GDP ratios are projected to dip
in 2006/07 and 2007/08, when Tala comes on stream and boosts GDP.7 Over the medium term,
disbursements for new projects are projected to offset repayments for Tala. When Puna I
comes on stream in 2016/17, the NPV-to-GDP dips and remains below the LIC-DSA
indicative thresholds for strong policy performance countries. Even though the debt service
ratios rise when repayments for large power projects begin, they moderate in the long run and
remain below the thresholds over most of the projection period. A further mitigating factor is
the level of reserves, at about 50 percent of GDP and ten months of import cover and projected
to rise further, which implies that repayment difficulties are in fact unlikely over the period
when indicative debt burden thresholds are breached.
B. Sensitivity Analysis
6.
The debt ratios decline over time under most alternative scenarios, and eventually
fall below the thresholds. For Bhutan, the two most extreme stress tests involve (i) new
borrowing on less favorable terms; and (ii) applying a one standard deviation shock to export
growth.8 The indicators deteriorate over the medium term if the current account excluding
7

The addition of accumulated IDC (12 percent of GDP) in 2007/08 to the nominal debt stocks does not affect the
public debt-to-GDP ratios in NPV terms (as it is already included), but does explain why the nominal
debt-to-GDP ratio remains roughly unchanged in 2007/08, despite rapid GDP growth.

8

Since hydropower cycles have shaped Bhutanese exports over the past 10 years, the variation of export growth
is very high. Applying a one standard deviation shock to export growth actually leads to a reduction in exports.

4
interest payments is set at its historical average. This is because Tala-related imports in the
past 10 years and the purchase of two airplanes in 2004/05 strongly bias the historical average
upward. The recently observed pickup in electricity exports from Tala renders this scenario
highly unlikely.
IV. PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
A. Baseline
7.
The baseline public debt dynamics is driven by the external debt of the power
sector. Over the medium term, grant inflows of about 8−9 percent of GDP are expected to
limit the overall fiscal deficit to 3−6 percent of GDP. With foreign financing of about
3⅓ percent of GDP, domestic financing should be limited to 1−2 percent of GDP, keeping
domestic debt to below 11 percent of GDP over the medium term. In the long run, moderate
broadening of the tax base and improvements in tax administration, combined with revenues
from additional hydropower projects, will sustain the domestic revenue ratio at about
18 percent of GDP. This will help achieve a small overall fiscal surplus and enable a reduction
in domestic debt.
B. Sensitivity Analysis
8.
The public debt ratios remain on a declining path over the long term under
various stress tests. However, the debt ratios would not improve drastically under the noreform scenario which assumes a primary deficit of 3.6 percent of GDP. The difference from
the baseline scenario stems from the projected path of the primary balance which averages to a
small surplus over the next 20 years. Containing capital expenditure as well as broadening
domestic tax base will be the key to ensure public debt sustainability.
V. STAFF ASSESSMENT
9.
Staffs view Bhutan’s debt dynamics as sustainable but subject to a moderate risk
of distress.
•

The analysis based on the LIC-DSA indicators and stress tests—showing the breaching
of some LIC-DSA thresholds—suggests that external debt dynamics should be
characterized as subject to a high risk of distress.

•

However, there are strong mitigating factors:
¾ Bhutan’s own experience with construction, commissioning and management of
large hydropower projects (which constitute the bulk of external debt) suggests that
the projects are subject to low implementation risk. Hydropower projects have
yielded expected growth dividends in the past. When Chukha, the first major
hydropower project came on stream in 1986, the electricity sector grew by

5
800 percent in 1985/86, 370 percent in 1986/87, and 60 percent in 1987/88,
boosting overall GDP growth rate to 10 percent, 23 percent, and 17 percent,
respectively. While the Tala commissioning was delayed by a year to mid-2006, in
2006/07 it increased total electricity sales by 80 percent and exports by over
90 percent compared to a year earlier, and was the main source of the 17 percent
increase in real GDP over the same period. The loan repayments for the Chukha
hydropower project are expected to be completed in 2007/08, twenty years after the
commissioning of the project in the mid-1980s.
¾ Puna I is currently expected to have smaller real costs of construction than Tala for
a larger generation capacity. As a result, Puna I’s internal rate of return is estimated
to be about 2 percentage points higher than Tala.
¾ The relationship with India suggests that commercial risk is essentially absent from
these projects. A key factor in the successful implementation of Chukha, and in the
case of other projects going forward, is Bhutan’s relationship with India, which is
both provider of financing for these large projects and the main consumer of their
output. The two countries therefore maintain a close dialogue on the financial and
technical aspects of the projects, besides the wider dialogue on support for annual
budgets and the five-year plans. For instance, in the case of Tala cost overruns were
financed by India on the same concessional terms as the original loan agreement.
•

In light of these factors, characterization of debt dynamics as subject to moderate risk
of distress is appropriate.

1/ Gross public and publicly guaranteed debt. In 2007/08, cumulative interest during construction for Tala (12 percent of GDP) is added to debt stock.
2/ Gross financing need is defined as the primary deficit plus debt service plus the stock of short-term debt at the end of the last period.
3/ Revenue excluding grants. The decline over the medium term mostly owes to declining receipts for Tala interest payments.
4/ Debt service is defined as the sum of interest and amortization of medium and long-term debt.
5/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
6/ Including rupee debt.

Sources: Data provided by the Bhutanese authorities; and Fund staff estimates and projections.

Average

1/ All external debt is public or publicly guaranteed. In 2007/08, cumulative interest during construction for Tala (12 percent of GDP) is added to debt stock.
2/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and r = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
5/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
6/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
7/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the NPV of new debt).

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
October 12, 2007

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with Bhutan
On October 5, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Bhutan.1
Background
Political stability and prudent economic management continue to contribute to a significant rise in
living standards and development indicators in Bhutan. Significant political changes are in the offing,
but the authorities are taking steps to ensure the continuation of sound policies.
Growth remained robust and macroeconomic outcomes were broadly favorable during 2005/06 (July
2005 –June 2006) and 2006/07. Economic growth was fueled by continued work on the Tala
hydropower project, public investment in infrastructure, and private investment in housing. In
addition, the services sector performed strongly driven by trade and financial sector. Real GDP
growth is estimated to have almost doubled from 9 percent in 2005/06 to 17 percent in 2006/07, with
much of Tala coming on stream. Inflation remained in line with price developments in India.
Large shifts in the fiscal position reflected a combination of revenue, expenditure, and aid volatility.
In 2005/06, a shortfall in excise duty refunds from India was more than offset by higher grants and
lower capital spending. The budget made a net repayment to the banking system of ¾ percent of
GDP. In 2006/07, the domestically financed deficit (2 percent) was higher-than-budgeted

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

(1½ percent of GDP). The main factors were a revenue shortfall (from continued shortfall in excise
duty refunds from India), higher-than-budgeted spending, and lower-than-budgeted loan inflows.
Although the public debt-to-GDP ratio rose, debt service obligations remained manageable. Public
debt doubled to over 80 percent of GDP at end-2005/06 from mid-2000. The bulk of the increase
was rupee borrowings from India for Tala. Domestic financing of budget deficits—in particular,
purchase of an aircraft at a cost of about US$39 million (4½ percent of GDP) for state-owned Druk
Air—also contributed to the increase in the public debt ratio. However, with debt service payments
on Tala scheduled to begin only in 2007/08, the debt service ratio remained around 6(10) percent of
exports (revenue) during the past five years.
The balance of payments remained in surplus and total international reserves rose. The trade
balance improved in 2005/06, as exports to countries other than India rose significantly. In 2006/07,
electricity exports from Tala shifted the trade balance into a small surplus. Together with a projected
surplus in the capital and financial account related to continued disbursements for Tala and other
external assistance, the total reserve cover (convertible currency and Indian rupees) at
end-2006/07 was over nine months of goods and services imports.
Bhutan’s economic prospects are bright. Construction of two hydropower projects will help sustain
real GDP growth over the medium term. With the exchange rate peg to the Indian rupee, inflation is
expected to be in line with price developments in India. The overall balance of payments is projected
to be in surplus and would help maintain adequate international reserves.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended Bhutan’s prudent macroeconomic policies and political stability,
which have yielded robust growth, an appreciable improvement in social indicators, and progress
toward meeting the Millennium Development Goals, contributing to a solid foundation for the
transition to a constitutional monarchy in 2008.
Directors welcomed the favorable macroeconomic outcomes and good medium-term growth
prospects. Rapid real GDP and per capita income growth over the last decade was led by the Tala
hydroelectric power project. The additional power projects in the pipeline, with strong donor support,
would maintain the growth momentum. Inflation has remained in line with price developments in
India and overall international reserves have remained adequate.
On monetary management, Directors called on the Royal Monetary Authority (RMA) to remain
watchful of excess liquidity and rapid credit growth. They welcomed the steps being taken to tighten
monetary conditions to deal with the temporary shortfall in rupee reserves and rein in private sector
credit growth. They recommended enhancing the RMA’s capacity in monetary and foreign exchange
reserve management, and supported the authorities’ request for Fund technical assistance in this
area.
Directors highlighted the need to limit the balance sheet exposures of financial institutions to
sectoral and macroeconomic risks, and to improve the ability of these institutions to monitor and

3
manage such risks. The development of government securities markets over the medium term
should help manage liquidity and provide alternative investment vehicles for financial institutions.
Directors encouraged the RMA to further enhance its capacity for financial sector supervision.
Directors agreed that the exchange rate peg of the ngultrum to the Indian rupee and the level of the
peg remain appropriate. The peg has anchored inflation expectations and facilitated trade with India.
Should the revenues from the Tala project lead to upward pressures on the real exchange rate,
fiscal tightening to moderate a rise in the prices of nontradable goods could mitigate such pressures.
Over the medium term, competitiveness could be enhanced by raising private sector productivity.
Directors underscored the importance of ensuring fiscal sustainability by limiting domestically
financed deficits and mobilizing external aid on a timely basis. This would help to maintain the public
debt-to-GDP ratio on a downward trajectory. Directors supported efforts to raise domestic revenues
by broadening the tax base and strengthening tax administration, including through a rationalization
of the sales tax and import duty rates. They encouraged the authorities to plan expenditure in a
medium-term framework. Directors concluded that Bhutan’s risk of external debt distress is
moderate, reflecting the authorities’ good record of implementation of externally financed
hydroelectric projects, high level of overall foreign exchange reserves, and strong external donor
support for the power sector projects.
Directors advised the authorities to accord high priority to private sector development and economic
diversification to ensure job creation. This would help overcome the constraints of Bhutan’s
landlocked location and small size. Key reforms include aligning Bhutan’s education system to
market needs, strengthening infrastructure, and further streamlining the regulatory regime. Directors
welcomed Bhutan’s plans to join the World Trade Organization.
Directors considered that Bhutan’s strong external position provides scope for further gradual
liberalization of exchange restrictions. The authorities were encouraged to eliminate restrictions
subject to approval under Article VIII as soon as possible, and to eliminate the restrictions
maintained under Article XIV as soon as Bhutan’s balance of payments position permits. Fund
technical assistance to help develop a foreign exchange market and market-based instruments to
manage hard currency flows would facilitate the elimination of these restrictions and allay concerns
about their removal.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ efforts to strengthen Bhutan’s statistical data. In particular, data
in the fiscal and external sectors need to be upgraded.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Adarsh Kishore, Executive Director for Bhutan
and Saranyan Krishnan, Advisor to Executive Director
October 5, 2007
1. On behalf of my authorities, I thank staff for the constructive policy discussions and
the comprehensive and analytical set of reports. My authorities agree with the thrust
of the staff appraisal and welcome the policy recommendations. Bhutan's
macroeconomic performance in the period since the last Article IV consultation has
strengthened even further. Aided by prudent policy making and strong support from
donors, GDP growth targets have been exceeded. Our authorities have achieved this
performance with no dilution in their commitment to preserving the environment and
the local culture and in a manner that enhances the pursuit of individual all round
happiness. Remarkable progress has been made in improving social indicators and
Bhutan is set to meet many of its Millennium Development Goals. The ambitious
growth targets of the 9th Plan have been by and large achieved, with external
assistance flowing in as anticipated.
2. Bhutan is at the cusp of a historic transformation that will accompany the adoption of
the Constitution and the introduction of parliamentary democracy in 2008. This
transition is progressing in a completely peaceful and orderly manner. Bhutan's
international integration is growing and accession to the WTO is planned to take
place during 2008. Bhutan has already joined the BIMSTEC, the IFC, SAFTA and
the World Customs Organization. The direction of Bhutan's trade is also gradually
diversifying and the share of newer trade partners like Hong Kong grew since the last
review. Bhutan's geographical location and close links with India continue to offer
immense opportunities. At the same time, it is recognized that strong economic links
with one country could pose some risks.
3. Bhutan's real GDP growth during 2006-07 is projected to almost double to 17 percent
from 9 percent in the year before. Growth is driven by the Tala Hydropower Project
going on-stream and government spending on infrastructure and private investment in
housing. Annual inflation in 2006-07 at 5 percent remains in line with price
developments in India, with the one to one exchange rate peg to the Indian rupee. The
Ngultrum has appreciated marginally against the US dollar. This, however, has not
had any significant bearing on the country's competitiveness. With electricity exports
from Tala commencing in 2006-07, the current account balance has shifted to a
sizeable surplus of 10.6 percent of GDP. Bhutan's foreign reserves presently cover 9
months of goods and services imports. However, the rupee reserve ratio has declined
to under one month, although this appears to be a cyclical issue.
4. My authorities recognize that despite an improvement in the overall budgetary
position of the country and developmental activities progressing without major
problems, challenges remain. Given the dependency on external aid, there is little
room for fiscal complacency.

Fiscal Policy
5. The overarching challenge of fiscal policy is to strengthen fiscal prudence and to
limit domestically financed deficits while continuing to finance ambitious
infrastructure projects beyond the current plan period into the 10th Plan period. With
generous grant assistance from development partners and rigorous expenditure
control the government has managed to keep overall deficits on an average at 4
percent of GDP, below the policy ceiling of 5 percent. While the Royal Government
would like to finance all capital expenditures of the Plans through grant financing, the
overall grants available are likely to be somewhat below the requirement and would
be partially compensated by external and domestic borrowing. My authorities agree
with staff assessment for the medium term fiscal framework that revenue receipts to
GDP ratio should be maintained at about 18.5 percent, expenditure contained to about
31 percent, divided equally between capital and current expenditure, and that
domestically financed deficits should be moderated to 1 - 2 percent of GDP. This
would involve ensuring that the Tala project is fully commissioned by 2008 and
commences yielding the expected revenues, negotiating grant financing from India
and preparing contingency plans to meet any shortfalls.
6. Reviewing the 2006 - 07 budget, the domestically financed fiscal deficit target of
1.5 percent is expected to be exceeded somewhat leaving a deficit of about 2 percent
of GDP. This is mainly on account of the higher spending associated with the
celebration on the centenary of the establishment of the monarchy in Bhutan and for
the new constitutional bodies to be set up in 2008.
7. The Tenth Plan is being prepared in the context of momentous socio-political change,
but the governing development philosophy of maximizing Gross National Happiness
will continue to hold true. The four pillars of GNH - promotion of equitable and
sustainable socioeconomic development; preservation and promotion of cultural
values; conservation of the national environment; and good governance - will form
the core values of the Tenth Plan. Poverty reduction will be the main development
goal of the Tenth Plan and programmes in all sectors will be prepared to target the
poor and vulnerable.
8. The budget for 2007-08 was endorsed by the National Assembly in 11 June 2007. As
a result of a combination of slightly higher levels of projected expenditure and the
expectation that slightly higher revenues being offset by a projected decline in grants,
my Bhutanese authorities anticipate the fiscal deficit to be 4 percent of GDP in the
budget estimates for the year 2007 - 08, with 2.75 percent being the domestically
financed deficit. In keeping with the longstanding government priority for the social
infrastructure, 22 percent of the budget has been allocated to the education and health
sectors, with emphasis on construction of outreach clinics, basic health units and
expansion of educational infrastructure. Domestic revenues are expected to increase,
due to higher contributions from the Tala project. While my authorities are committed
to seeking external financing, should such aid not materialize the Royal Government
may have to rely on domestic finances to meet the expenditure plans.

9. My Bhutanese authorities are aware that there are risks and vulnerabilities on the debt
sustainability front. However, there are also strong mitigating factors. Most the
contracted debt is intended for implementation of hydro-electric projects. The record
of such implementation starting with Chukha (336 MW), Kurichhu (60 MW) and
now Tala (1020 MW) has been very encouraging. The Punatsangchhu and Dagchhu
projects are being undertaken in this back-drop. A further element contributing to
sustainability of the debt is Bhutan's relationship with India which has found new
meaning and been further strengthened with the signing of the new India-Bhutan
Friendship Treaty in February 2007. Since India has also committed to purchase at
least 5000 MW of power from Bhutan by 2020, no difficulty is expected on
sustainability of debt for the hydro-electric sector. Regular plan assistance is received
as a grant and the Indian and Bhutanese authorities are in regular touch on this issue.
Monetary Policy and Financial Sector
10. The exchange rate peg of the Ngultrum to the Indian rupee has served Bhutan well
and the exchange rate peg and its level remain appropriate. However, the immediate
challenge is to tighten monetary conditions to support the exchange rate peg. The
RMA is maintaining a close watch on the liquidity conditions and is prepared to take
appropriate measures to absorb excess liquidity. My RMA authorities concur with
staff advice on this issue and are contemplating a stepped up issuance of RMA Bills
and an increase of the Cash Reserve Ratio.
11. In 2007-08, with the commissioning of the Tala project, the current account is likely
to remain in a surplus of about 10 percent of GDP. Reserves are expected to grow
even further beyond the present level of about 9 months of goods and services
imports.
12. An immediate issue is the temporary shortage in rupee liquidity, with rupee reserves
having dropped to less than one month's imports in July 2007. This is a temporary
and cyclical phenomenon which can be overcome by appropriate measures to
monitor, manage and forecast rupee liquidity. In case the situation persists, the Royal
authorities are contemplating negotiating a concessional rupee credit line with India.
13. My RMA authorities find it difficult to eliminate the remaining restrictions under
Article XIV and to accept the obligations under Article VIII given the currency
composition of the balance of payments and their concerns over hard currency
outflows. Given the limited and unpredictable sources of convertible currency inflows
liberalization of the remaining restrictions would need to be taken cautiously with
further diversification of export earnings and the developments in greater
convertibility of the Indian rupee. I would seek support of my colleagues for an
extension to the arrangement.
Financial Sector Issues:
14. The financial sector has performed well and private sector growth has been robust,
exceeding 30 percent. The RMA is conscious of the risks of the rapid private sector
credit growth, specifically the vulnerability of banks' balance sheets to concentration

4
of credit growth in the housing sector. The RMA is closely monitoring the situation
and is prepared to take further prudential measures.
15. My authorities are aware of the need to provide more investment opportunities for the
commercial banks. Maturity mismatches in the financial institution balance sheets are
sought to be addressed through developing the government bonds market. The
development of financial markets will require a further strengthening of the
institutional capacity in the RMA, given the lack of adequate technical expertise. The
RMA authorities are keen on a long-term technical assistance on central banking from
the Fund. Since the central banking functions of the RMA are modeled on the
Reserve Bank of India, their preference is for an expert familiar with RBI operations.
Structural Issues
16. Hydropower is the engine of economic growth and it is planned that this sector will
account for an even larger proportion of the economy at the conclusion of the Tenth
Plan period. Tala project is expected to generate electricity up to its installed capacity
of 1020 MW by 2008. In July 2007 an agreement was signed for the implementation
of the 1095 MW Punatsangchhu -I hydro-electric power project which is expected to
be completed by 2014. The Dagachu power project is being implemented with
Austrian assistance. India has committed to import a minimum of 5000 MW of
electricity from Bhutan by 2020, assuring evacuation of the electricity generated.
17. My Bhutanese authorities recognize the significant potential of Bhutan's tourism
sector with the main focus on promoting and maintaining Bhutan as a high quality
destination. The goal is to increase annual tourist arrivals from about 13,000 in
2005 to about 30,000 by the end of the Tenth Plan period. The sector has attracted the
largest FDI in recent years and some hotel chains have also started investing.
18. Bhutan faces the challenge of providing employment to rapidly growing labor force.
The authorities are making efforts to match supply by generating demand and by
improving employability. Promotion of small scale industries, horticulture,
floriculture and handicrafts will increase avenues for self employment. The Royal
Bhutan Vocational and Qualifications Authority is expected to bring a greater focus
to improved vocational training facilities including job-oriented skill upgradation to
reduce the skill mismatch and conduct of job fairs to promote employment in private
sector companies.
19. Bhutan's close trade links with India means that further trade liberalization would
broadly follow developments in India. The regional trade agreements and accession
commitments to WTO will help streamline the regulatory environment to
international standards. My Bhutanese authorities are seeking technical assistance
from the IMF to enable them to meet the commitments of accession to WTO by 2008.
Statistical Issues
20. My authorities are continuing their efforts to improve the statistical data base through
a variety of interventions. The periodicity of CPI has increased from half yearly to

5
quarterly and the national income accounts have shifted to SNA 1993. Trade statistics
are compiled on fiscal year basis for Balance of Payments statistics. Only
composition and direction of trade are still being done on calendar year basis. Efforts
are on to improve the frequency of preparation of the RMA balance sheet from
monthly to a weekly basis and reconcile domestic financing of budget between the
fiscal accounts and the monetary survey.
21. Finally my authorities and I would like to thank the Executive Board and staff for
their continued support and helpful advice.
