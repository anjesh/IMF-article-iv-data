STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Context. Macroeconomic outcomes were strong in 2011, supported by high oil revenues.
However, the pace of recovery of non-oil economic activity continued to be moderate, with
still weak, although improved, growth of banks’ credit; inflation also remained moderate. The
policymaking landscape changed significantly in recent months, and a new government and
parliament are now in place. Kuwait ranks relatively low on essential elements for
competitiveness and lags in the quality of its physical and social infrastructure relative to its
GDP per capita level.
Outlook and risks. Economic recovery is expected to strengthen, led by increasing
government expenditure—particularly in wages and capital outlays. High fiscal and external
surpluses are expected to persist. Inflation is projected to moderate slightly, but inflation risk
is on the upside. Risks for the outlook include low implementation rates of the capital
budget and legislative bottlenecks, which could dampen the recovery. Like other countries,
Kuwait is exposed to external risks, including the intensification of the European crisis, but
these risks are manageable.
Macroeconomic policies. The near-term macroeconomic policy stance is expected to
remain supportive. Kuwait has significant fiscal space, but rising public sector wage and
pension costs and rapid population growth are expected to exert pressures on public
finances in the medium term. If Kuwait is to preserve wealth equally for its future
generations, fiscal consolidation will be needed in the medium term.
Financial stability. The banking sector remains resilient, but conditions in the investment
companies sector have deteriorated. The authorities are encouraged to continue to be
vigilant regarding existing and emerging risks, continue to enhance ICs supervision, and
develop the needed tools for ICs resolution.
Statistics. Data provision has shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. Further
progress in the quality and timeliness of data is needed, particularly in the national accounts.

INTRODUCTION
1.
Kuwait had strong macroeconomic outcomes in recent years, but it still faces
challenges to improve its physical and social infrastructure and to diversify its economic base.
Kuwait has posted fiscal and external surpluses for thirteen years in a row, and maintained a largely
stable macroeconomic environment. Nevertheless, it fares relatively low in international comparisons
as regards the quality of its infrastructure, health, and education, when compared with countries
with similar GDP per capita level (Figure 1). The economy remains oil dominated and the private
sector is largely dependent on government spending and expatriate labor. The labor market is
highly segmented: Kuwaiti nationals work primarily in the public sector—about 80 percent of the
Kuwaiti labor force is employed in the public sector—and Kuwaitis constitute only 7 percent of the
private sector labor force, while expatriates are employed mostly in the private sector.1

2.
A four-year development plan (DP) was launched in FY 2010/11. The DP is the first of a
series of plans based on a strategic vision for 2035 that emphasizes investment in infrastructure,
health, and education, and envisages significant co-participation of the private sector through the
establishment of public shareholding companies. In addition, the Plan aims at diversifying Kuwait’s
economy by transforming the country into a regional financial and trade hub.
3.
The policymaking landscape changed significantly in 2011 and early 2012. After six
cabinet resignations in the past five years, the prime minister resigned in late 2011 and new
parliamentary elections were held in early February 2012, producing significant gains for the
opposition. A new government was formed shortly after.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
Oil sector has expanded, but non-oil sector recovery is still moderate
4.
Fiscal and external outcomes were strong in 2011. Government expenditure continued to
increase in FY 2011/12 (8 percent), reflecting a significant increase in the wage bill and capital
expenditure (about 20 percent). The budget expansion was more than offset by the increase in oil
revenue (35 percent) emanating from higher oil prices and production levels. Overall, fiscal and
external surpluses are estimated to have reached more than 30 percent and 41 percent of GDP in
2011, respectively.
5.
Notwithstanding significant fiscal support over the past few years, the pace of
recovery of non-oil economic activity after the 2008 global financial crisis has been moderate.
Non-oil growth in 2011 is estimated at about

Recent international oil prices did not have an impact on the CPI because Kuwait has generous oil-related subsidies
(fuel, electricity, and water) and retail oil-related prices are not adjusted with international price movements. The cost
of these subsidies is reported explicitly in the budget.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

The banking sector is strong but investment companies’ conditions continued to worsen
6.
The banking sector faced a mixed environment in 2011, but its financial soundness
indicators (FSIs) remained sound. On the one hand, liquidity conditions remained favorable and
lending to some sectors, in particular industry and households, strengthened compared to 2010
(Figure 4). The sector remained profitable, although profits of the banks remained largely flat
because of a buildup in provisions. Although they have slightly declined in 2011, banks’ capital
adequacy and leverage ratios remained robust, owing to capital injections and subordinated debt
issuance in 2010. Bank liquidity improved substantially due to a combination of high retail deposit
growth and still-moderate lending growth. Nonperforming loan (NPL) ratios continued to decline
in 2011, reaching 7.3 percent in 2011 compared to their peak of 11.5 percent in 2009. The decline
continued to be largely on account of write-offs of investment companies’ (ICs) loans and loan
repayments related to loan restructurings, and resulted in a reduction of the specific provisions
to NPL ratio. On the other hand, some vulnerabilities in banks’ asset quality remain: in addition
to a lack of improvement in the real estate companies sector and a decline of 16½ percent in the
domestic stock market, ICs continued to face difficulties, forcing banks to take large provisions.
Banks’ equity prices fell 5 percent in 2011, a much lower drop compared to the overall index
(Figure 5).

Investment companies came under renewed pressures. ICs have been under pressure
since the beginning of the global financial crisis given their exposure to domestic, regional, and
international equity and real estate markets and their dependence on short-term foreign lending.4
While there was some initial progress in ICs restructuring in 2009–10, the sector has hit renewed
setbacks due to adverse market conditions in 2011 and the re-emergence of global liquidity strains
(see accompanying Selected Issues Paper). As a result, the sector posted losses in 2011 as opposed

to slight profits in 2010.5 The creditor protection clause under the 2009 Financial Stability Law has
only been utilized in one case so far;6 only one restructuring was completed under the law, but it is
yet to be seen if the restructuring plan will be executed successfully. Average equity prices of ICs
declined almost 27 percent in 2011, which brings the cumulative decline vis-à-vis August 2008 to
almost 79 percent.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
Economic recovery expected to strengthen
8.
Economic recovery is expected to strengthen, led by increasing government
expenditure. Staff projects a 15 percent increase in government spending, including a 16 percent
increase in the wage bill and a 30 percent increase in capital expenditure. Non-oil economic activity
is expected to expand about 5½ percent in 2012, and fiscal and external surpluses are projected to
remain over 30 percent and 40 percent of GDP, respectively. Inflation is expected to moderate
slightly to 4.4 percent, due to a decline in global food inflation that is expected to offset a slight
increase in nonfood inflation reflecting the impact of public sector wage increases. The high level of
openness of the economy–a high elasticity of labor supply and a large share of imported goods in
the consumption basket–should help contain inflationary pressures.
The economy remains exposed to external and domestic risks
9.
Similar to other countries, Kuwait is exposed to external risks, including the
intensification of the European crisis.


Kuwait has accumulated a significant stock of financial assets, which provides it with a cushion to
ease the impact of a temporary decline in oil prices. Nevertheless, a worsening of the crisis in
Europe could result in a tail risk event of a protracted period of low oil global demand and
prices, and a further tightening of global financial markets. If this risk materializes it could affect
Kuwait’s fiscal and external revenues and the private sector’s debt roll-over risk, further
weakening the financial situation of ICs.



Adverse external shocks could also affect the valuation of Kuwait’s cross-border investments,
with a particular impact on ICs (see Box 1 and accompanying Selected Issues Paper).



Geopolitical events that could affect Kuwait’s oil export lines also constitute a risk.

5

Based on data for listed companies. Only about half of the listed ICs published their annual financial statements at
end-2011, suggesting that actual losses in the sector might be higher than what has been published so far.

Two more companies have recently applied for protection from creditors, and the CBK is evaluating their financial
condition in order to present a recommendation to the court.

The majority of investments are in the GCC (about 40 percent of portfolio investment and
50 percent of FDI), rendering Kuwait particularly vulnerable to financial market fluctuations in the
region.3



The private sector’s exposure to the rest of the MENA region is relatively small (7 percent of
portfolio investment and 20 percent of FDI). Accordingly, the impact of developments in Arab
countries undergoing transition on Kuwaiti private sector investments is estimated to be limited.



A confined event in the GIIPS (Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain) would have a limited
impact on Kuwait’s private sector investment, as its exposure to these countries is relatively small.

The value and geographic and asset class allocation of KIA’s assets are not published. Accordingly, the

For example, the intensification of the European debt crisis could spill over to the rest of the world, including
the GCC—the correlation between global and GCC regional financial markets has increased significantly since
the global crisis because of high volatility.

10.
Low capital budget implementation rates could hamper the recovery and undermine
the objectives of the DP. The overarching issue for

increase in investment rates if the required improvements in the country’s physical and social
infrastructure are to be achieved. On the public sector side, the implementation of the capital
expenditure budget has been only in the 75–80 percent range in recent years, and is estimated to
have fallen below this range in FY 2011/12. Project implementation has been generally delayed by
red-tape and bureaucracy, an outdated legislative base, deficiencies in laws that have been passed
in recent years, and delays in passing new legislation. Overall, slippage in capital expenditures could
hamper the recovery; capital expenditure has high growth multipliers and also helps catalyze private
investment, particularly in the context of the DP.
11.
The authorities stressed that the GCC is at a lower risk from global developments than
are other regions. The authorities broadly agreed with the staff assessment but noted that GCC
countries were less at risk from global developments, as evidenced by healthy growth rates in the
region. In this context, external risks for Kuwait were manageable in view of the large concentration
of cross-border investments in the GCC.

ICs could be significantly affected by this
scenario. Banks’ provisions would need
to increase further, tightening domestic

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Near-Term Macroeconomic Policy Mix
12.
The near-term fiscal policy stance remains appropriately supportive. Compared to the
previous fiscal year, there is likely to be a fiscal stimulus of 4.7 percentage points in the non-oil
primary deficit to non-oil GDP (Figure 7). The supportive fiscal stance is called for in view of stillmoderate economic growth. But the

the capital budget as much as possible to
preserve the productivity of government spending, and should focus on containing the growth of
current expenditures, particularly the wage bill, given their rapid increase in recent years. Revenue
options could also be considered (par. 19).
13.
Monetary policy and liquidity conditions also remain appropriately supportive. Policy
interest rates are expected to remain historically low—consistent with Kuwait’s high degree of free
capital mobility, the currency basket peg, and low international interest rates.8 Current liquidity
conditions are supportive of a strengthening of private sector credit growth. In view of the
limitations of monetary policy in the context of the exchange rate peg, fiscal policy should be the
first line of defense but macroprudential policies (e.g., loan-to-deposit ratio, liquidity ratios,
household debt-service ratio) could be utilized in managing domestic liquidity and credit conditions
should inflationary pressures emerge.
14.
Assessments of the real exchange rate suggest that the Dinar is broadly in line with
fundamentals. The methods based on current account assessment give mixed results, as the
underlying current account is: (i) somewhat higher than the norm suggested by the macro-balance
approach (suggesting an undervaluation), but (ii) smaller than the norm suggested by the external
sustainability approach (suggesting some overvaluation). The equilibrium real exchange rate

It should be noted, however, that a 2009 study on GCC monetary policy, Bova and Senhadji find that, given the

B. Maintaining a Sustainable Medium- to Long-Term Fiscal Envelope While
Improving the Efficiency and Welfare Impact of Government Expenditure
15.
Kuwait has significant fiscal space. Kuwait has large fiscal buffers, thanks to 13 consecutive
years of fiscal surpluses. In addition, while the FY 2011/12 fiscal breakeven oil price of $44 per barrel
is much higher than the fiscal breakeven price of $17 per barrel just before the global financial crisis
(FY 2007/08),9 the ratio of the break-even price to current market prices remains similar to historical
standards.
16.
Nonetheless, rising public sector
wage and pension costs and rapid population
growth are expected to exert pressures on
public finances. The average real and nominal
growth rate of the public sector wage bill has
more than doubled in the last six years
(2006/07–2011/12), to 8 percent and 13 percent,
respectively (Figure 8). The continuation of such
a trend could put significant pressures on
government finances—via higher wage

Fiscal breakeven price calculations include investment income and profits from some public sector agencies not
included in the budget (Kuwait Investment Authority, Kuwait Petroleum Corporation, and the Central Bank). An
alternative calculation that accounts for transfers to the Future Generations Fund as an expenditure and excludes
investment income from oil revenues results in a fiscal breakeven price of $36 and $66 for FY 2007/08 and
FY 2011/12, respectively.

payments, government pension contributions, and an increase in the unfunded liabilities of the
pension system—and would be difficult to reverse if oil prices were to decline significantly in the
future. The cost of the pension system is onerous for Kuwait, particularly given its low retirement
age (see Appendix I) and generous benefits.10 Finally, rapid population and labor force growth—
about 60 percent of the Kuwaiti population is under 24 years—is likely to put increasing pressures
on public sector employment and the provision of public services.
17.
Kuwait is now at a crossroads as regards conserving wealth for its future generations.
Staff estimates indicate that government expenditure will exhaust all oil revenues by 2017, which
means no portion of these revenues would be saved for future generations (Figure 9).11 In this
relation, medium-term benchmarks for government expenditure can help policymakers determine
the fiscal envelope if they intend to pursue

and some fiscal consolidation would be
needed in the medium to long term (Figure 10, left panel). In this context, an adjustment of at least
12 percentage points of the non-oil primary deficit to GDP (or KD 7 billion against a projected
expenditure of around KD 25 billion in FY 2016/17) would be needed by 2017. The need for
medium-term fiscal consolidation would be smaller in the case of lower long-term population
growth rates (around KD 2 billion by FY 2016/17), but larger and more urgent in a scenario of lower
oil prices (Figure 10, right panel).

10

The last actuarial assessment, based on 2007 data, indicated unfunded liabilities in the order of KD 11 billion
(23 percent of 2011 GDP). While, the central government has paid already over two-thirds of that liability and will
complete the payments by FY 2014/15, recent wage increases will certainly add new unfunded liabilities.
11
Projections assume a trend decline of oil prices in the medium term, from an average of $113 per barrel in 2012
to $91 per barrel by 2017.

1 In this exercise, long-term sustainability assumes intergenerational equity by calculating a constant real per capita government expenditure path (and related non-oil deficit) that
delivers a constant real per capita annuity to finance government expenditures after oil revenues are exhausted. The non-oil deficit calculations discussed above refer to the non-oil
deficit excluding investment income.

18.
Overall, there is a need to improve the productivity and welfare impact of government
spending. In particular:


Reallocating government expenditure toward capital expenditure, which has higher growth
multipliers, would enhance non-oil GDP growth and strengthen the long-term sustainability of
the fiscal accounts, while improving the productivity of government expenditure and
contributing to the country’s diversification objectives. The authorities should contain the
growth of the public sector wage bill, consider increasing individuals’ pension contributions to
avoid a further buildup of unfunded liabilities, and avoid any new measures that could further
increase current expenditures.



Expenditure under the DP should focus on social and key physical infrastructure projects,
keeping in mind project viability. In this regard, project design and implementation should
focus on the strategic direction of the long-term vision for Kuwait, and should also take into
account implementation capacity.



Revisiting general energy subsidies. About 20 percent of government expenditures are in the
form of untargeted oil-related subsidies and benefits (electricity, water, and fuel).12 While staff
recognizes the challenges of implementing subsidy reforms, the phased withdrawal of these
subsidies should be part of a medium- to long-term fiscal reform program. Staff estimates that
Kuwait’s per capita energy consumption would decline by 27–41 percent in the long term if

12

These subsidies have low growth multipliers, encourage excess consumption, and are received disproportionally by
high-income population groups.

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KUWAIT

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

domestic oil prices reflected international levels (see accompanying Selected Issues Paper).13
Savings that accrue to the government from the elimination of subsidies (about 7 percent of
2011 GDP or 140 percent of capital expenditures in FY 2011/12) could be partly used to provide
targeted subsidies to the lower-income segment of the population.
19.
Medium-to-long-term fiscal reforms should also include the tax system. Introduction of
a VAT, which the authorities are planning in conjunction with GCC-wide VAT implementation by
2014, would be a step forward. Progress made so far in this area is welcome, but the authorities
would need to further build the institutional capacity to ensure its effectiveness. Although the
proposed rate (5 percent) is estimated to increase government revenues by only 2–3 percent of GDP
in the short term, it could progressively contribute more as the non-oil sector continues to expand.14
The authorities are also undertaking preparations for the introduction of a comprehensive income
tax system.
20.
A fiscal rule could be useful for medium-term fiscal management. Government
expenditure remains largely driven by oil revenues (see Figure 8 above). In this context, while the
authorities have made progress in strengthening the institutional and analytical underpinnings for
fiscal policy—including the establishment of a macro-fiscal unit, the planned adoption of the GFSM
2001 standards, and ultimately a move to performance-based budgeting—the adoption of a
medium-term budget framework and a well-designed fiscal rule could help contain pressures to
increase government expenditure and improve the management of future oil cycles (see
accompanying Selected Issues Paper). The authorities have requested TA from the IMF on
implementing a multi-year budget framework.
21.
The authorities agreed broadly with the staff assessment but stressed implementation
limitations. While the authorities acknowledged the rigidity of government expenditures and
agreed with the need to introduce revenue measures, they stressed pressures for higher
government transfers given large fiscal surpluses. In this context, they thought it was unlikely that
fiscal consolidation could be implemented in line with the staff-suggested path to achieve
intergenerational equity by 2017. While subsidy reform was not under consideration at this time, the
authorities were examining options to enhance government revenues, including improving the fee
structure of government services and utility bill collection. The authorities emphasized recent
improvements in developing the institutional framework for fiscal policy, and noted ongoing work
with the World Bank on improving the project cycle and the preparation of a draft public tender law.

13

U.S. retail prices excluding U.S. taxes, which are around 180 percent of Kuwait retail prices, are used as an
international benchmark for the calculations.
14

In coordination with the World Bank, Fiscal Affairs Department and Legal Department have provided technical
assistance to Kuwait (TA) on VAT policy and administration in FY 2011/12 (the World Bank is providing extensive TA
to Kuwait in this area).

KUWAIT

C. Improving the Business Environment
22.
Kuwait ranks relatively low on essential elements for competitiveness. In general,
inefficient government bureaucracy and restrictive labor and education conditions—notably the
quality of the education system and availability of high-quality specialized training services—are
quoted by market participants as the most problematic factors for doing business in Kuwait (see
accompanying Selected Issues Paper). Another area that needs immediate attention is Kuwait’s
ability to attract foreign direct investment, which in its present condition limits the benefits from the
transfer of technology and knowhow that foreign ownership could bring.
23.
Kuwait also lags in basic corporate governance indicators, such as the strength of
auditing and financial reporting standards, the efficacy of corporate boards of directors, and the
protection of minority shareholders’ interest. In particular, weak corporate governance practices
contributed to the buildup of vulnerabilities of ICs during the pre-crisis boom years and have
resulted in significant challenges for the sector after the global crisis. The recently-established
CMA has issued bylaws and new listing requirements that seek to strengthen corporate governance.
Nevertheless, challenges remain in view of the nature of the ownership structure of ICs (largely
family-owned) and the generally weak risk management practices and oversight role of the boards.
On the banking sector side, the CBK has made important steps in improving corporate governance,
including by focusing on risk management practices in banks, and is currently in the process
of drafting new corporate governance guidelines for banks with a view to strengthen the oversight
role of bank boards.
24.
Public sector wage policy is inconsistent with the government’s labor policies and
objectives of the DP. Despite the imposition of minimum quotas for Kuwaiti employment in the
private sector and the provision of financial incentives, Kuwaitis constitute only about 7 percent of
the private sector labor force. This reflects the attractiveness of public sector employment—higher
wages and benefits and lower working hours—and the mismatch between the Kuwaiti labor force’s
skills and the needs of the private sector. Given projected high rates of growth of the Kuwaiti labor
force, such a growth—employment model would undermine economic diversification and impose
unproductive budgetary costs. Staff estimates that about 74,000–112,000 Kuwaitis will enter the
labor force in the next five years (2012–16), while the private sector is projected to create only about
17,000 jobs for Kuwaitis (see accompanying Selected Issues Paper). These dynamics would put
pressure on the government to absorb about 11,000–19,000 youth per year, further straining
government finances.
25.
Legislative and other reforms are needed. To enhance the business environment there is a
need to upgrade the education system to improve the quality of education and make it attuned to
the needs of the business sector. On the financial and corporate sector sides, strengthening
institutions’ board member composition and role (e.g., by requiring a larger share of independent
members), and enforcing the appropriate implementation of auditing and reporting standards
should be priorities. On the legislative side, the authorities should proceed with modernizing
legislation to enhance the business environment and increase the efficiency of government

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KUWAIT

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

procedures, taking into account best international practices. Overall, the authorities should avoid the
pitfalls of recent legislative experience, where a number of laws that were passed proved to be
deficient and now require amendment. Finally, the authorities are encouraged to undertake a
comprehensive review of business procedures and requirements with a view to streamlining them.
26.
The authorities broadly agreed with the staff assessment, but stressed implementation
challenges. The authorities maintained that they had the needed skills and resources to implement
structural reforms, but progress was constrained by the lack of political consensus on priorities for
reform implementation.

D. Maintaining Financial Sector Stability
27.
The CBK has made significant progress in implementing the 2010 FSAP
recommendations. Specifically: (i) the CBK has completed the establishment of a financial stability
office; (ii) the onsite supervision function has been strengthened;15 (iii) the transition to risk-based
supervision has now been completed;16 (iv) seven ICAAP assessments have been completed so far,
one is under review, and only two assessments remain to be done; (v) in addition to the stress tests
that are conducted by the banks themselves, the CBK now conducts periodic stress tests that model
stress events vis-à-vis credit, market, and liquidity risk and take into account scenarios of increasing
severity; and (iv) off-site surveillance is now used systemically to identify risk areas and the work
program for onsite inspections. Furthermore, emphasis has been placed on improving banks’
corporate governance; new guidelines that are based on the World Bank’s 2009 corporate
governance assessment and Basel Committee recommendations are about to be finalized.
28.
The newly established CMA commenced its supervisory role in September 2011. All ICs
are now under dual supervision by the CBK17 and CMA pending the separation of ICs’ activities
(i.e. lending versus other investment banking activities), and the CBK and the CMA meet regularly
to ensure coordination based on the MoU that they have concluded on this issue. The CMA faced
significant challenges in assuming its role initially, including due to the gridlock caused by the
suspension of three of its commissioners in 2011 and the lack of adequate staffing, in both number
and expertise. Nevertheless, the CMA appears to have resumed its activities at a normal pace more
recently and has been active in enforcing its bylaws.
29.
The authorities should continue to be vigilant toward existing and emerging risks.
Specifically, the authorities should maintain their strategy of building precautionary provisions and
retained profits by banks, continue to enhance ICs supervision, and develop the needed tools for ICs
resolution. In this context:
15

Twelve new staff have been hired and the inspection cycle has been shortened to 18 months.

16

Importantly, an inspection work program related to risk management is at an advanced stage.

17

CBK supervision only covers lending activities. Consequently, the regulations that had been issued in June 2010 on
liquidity, leverage, and FX borrowing for implementation by June 2012 have been suspended.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

KUWAIT



Banks should continue to build precautionary provisions and retain profits, both against ICs’
loan portfolio and also vis-à-vis other weak and volatile sectors, particularly real estate and
lending for the purchase of securities—the latter two sectors constitute 26 percent and
10 percent of banks’ total loan portfolio, respectively.18 Real estate companies have posted
losses in the past three years while both domestic and regional stock markets have not yet
recovered from the decline experienced as a result of the global financial crisis.



The authorities are encouraged to modernize the legal framework for companies’
restructuring/resolution, with special attention to financial institutions. In the absence of an
adequate legal framework, the timeframe and the legal process for the restructuring of
distressed but viable ICs, or the exit of non-viable ICs, is unclear. The current legal framework
under the Companies Law is tilted toward liquidation (which tends to be a protracted process)
and the creditor protection clause under the financial stability law has had a limited impact in
facilitating the restructuring of distressed ICs; therefore, the formation of a committee, led by
the Ministry of Commerce and Industry with the membership of the CBK and the CMA, to study
proposals on this issue, is welcome. While the direct loan portfolio risk facing banks from
conditions in ICs has declined in view of the ongoing buildup of bank provisions against these
loans, the quick resolution of distressed ICs and the exit of non-viable ones will help ensure least
cost resolution for all parties involved (including banks), limit negative spillovers within the ICs
sector,19 reduce banks’ risk aversion and encourage lending, and strengthen investor sentiment.
At the same time, the bailout of non-viable ICs should be avoided to limit moral hazard.



The CMA has made substantial progress since its inception and has already overcome important
challenges. It should continue to build up its staffing capacity so that it can fully meet its
supervisory responsibilities. The CMA’s intention to seek expertise in designing a strengthened
framework for ICs regulation is welcome, but efforts should be accelerated to ensure that ICs are
well regulated and supervised.



The CBK and the CMA should continue to have effective discussions and coordination regarding
the supervision of ICs.

30.
The independence of the CBK should be strengthened and preserved. In developing a
new and improved national legislative base, the authorities should continue to take into account the
specific nature of the central bank’s operations and the need to strengthen and preserves its
independence. Specifically, international experience points to the following:


Central bank audit procedures. Due to the need for specialized technical expertise, a qualified
external auditor should audit the central bank’s financial statements. Government audits, if at all
required, should be limited to ex post audits of non-policy-related operational expenditures.

18

The Central Bank requested banks in the past two years to build up precautionary provisions against their ICs
portfolios, creating an additional cushion to absorb potential future losses.

19

The lack of confidence in the sector as a whole has had a negative impact on otherwise healthy ICs as the sector
saw substantial investor withdrawals and a significant impact on fee-based operations.

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KUWAIT

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT



The budget of the central bank. The central bank should be free to determine its annual budget.
Ex post budget accountability should be limited to non-policy-related expenditure.



Public sector tendering regulations. Procurement accountability is best carried out through a
strong central bank board and an active audit committee with clear lines of accountability within
the central bank. Public procurement laws do not make allowances for the special nature of the
central bank and could thus unduly complicate procurement by the central bank.

31.
Developing the domestic debt market should help diversify financing sources and
deepen financial intermediation. Staff encourages the authorities to follow up on the
recommendations of a recent IMF/AMF TA mission, in particular to establish a public—private sector
task force to produce an action plan for the way forward, which should include the introduction of a
regulated trading platform for fixed-income securities and the improvement of the regulatory
framework.
32.
The authorities stressed their commitment to continuing implementation of the 2010
FSAP recommendations. Specifically, senior CBK management follows up regularly on the
implementation status of FSAP recommendations. As regards emerging financial sector risks, the
CBK affirmed its intention to continue to encourage banks to retain profits and maintain the strategy
of building precautionary provisions against all questionable portfolios in all sectors. The authorities
affirmed continued cooperation between the CMA and the CBK to ensure smooth cooperation in ICs
supervision. The CMA noted that it was seeking expert assistance in designing a regulatory
framework for ICs.

E. Other Issues
33.
There has been significant progress in improving Kuwait’s statistical system, but
further improvements are needed. In particular, the authorities have improved the timeliness of
the CPI data, strengthened balance of payments, external debt, and IIP statistics, completed the
2011 national census, caught up with delays in the production of the national accounts at constant
prices, and are currently in the process of implementing the new Balance of Payments Manual
(BPM6) and strengthening national accounts statistics. The authorities are currently receiving
technical assistance from the World Bank in the area of national accounts, and are encouraged to
provide the needed resources to the Central Statistical Bureau to achieve further improvements in
Kuwait’s statistical system.
34.
The recent AML/CFT assessment indicates that there are a number of shortcomings in
Kuwait’s AML/CFT framework. The assessment, which was published in September 2011,
highlighted the lack of criminalization of terrorism financing and loopholes in the AML/CFT
preventive, institutional, and supervisory frameworks. While the authorities have not adopted a new
AML/CFT law yet, they have requested technical assistance from the Fund in this area.

STAFF APPRAISAL
35.
The economic outlook for 2012 is broadly positive. Economic recovery is expected to
strengthen, led by high government expenditure—particularly wages and capital expenditure. High
fiscal and external surpluses are expected to persist. Inflation is projected to moderate slightly due
to a decline in global food inflation. Low implementation rates of the capital budget and legislative
bottlenecks could, however, dampen the recovery.
36.
Near term economic policies should continue to remain supportive. While the
supportive fiscal stance is appropriate and has been called for in recent years in view of stillmoderate economic growth and low inflationary pressure, the recurrent nature of expenditure
growth increases the rigidity of the budget and complicates short-term fiscal management. Inflation
is projected to remain low, but inflation risk is on the upside and the authorities should be ready
with a strategy for fiscal adjustment if inflationary pressures build up. This strategy should safeguard
the capital budget as much as possible. The real exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals.
37.
Kuwait has significant fiscal space but the country is now at a crossroads as regards
conserving wealth for its future generations. Kuwait’s non-oil primary deficit is above the
estimated baseline benchmarks that take into account intergenerational equity in the distribution of
oil wealth. Furthermore, rising public sector wage and pension costs and rapid population growth
are expected to exert pressures on public finances in the medium term. If Kuwait is to preserve
wealth equally for its future generations, fiscal consolidation will be needed in the medium term.
38.
Overall, there is a need to improve the productivity and welfare impact of government
spending. Reallocating government expenditure toward capital expenditure would enhance non-oil
GDP growth and improve the long-term outcomes of the fiscal accounts, while improving the
productivity of government expenditure and contributing to the diversification objectives of the DP.
In this connection, the authorities are encouraged to improve the government’s capacity to
implement the capital budget, contain the growth of the public sector wage bill, avoid a further
buildup of the pension system’s unfunded liabilities, and avoid new measures that would further
increase current expenditures. The introduction of a VAT would be a step forward. The adoption of a
medium-term budget framework and a well-designed fiscal rule could improve fiscal management.
Finally, the phased retargeting of fuel-related subsidies to the most vulnerable segments of the
population should be part of a medium- to long-term fiscal reform program.
39.
Legislative and other reforms are needed to improve Kuwait’s business environment
and employment opportunities for Kuwaitis. Specific attention should be given to upgrading the
education system to make it attuned to the needs of the business sector. Corporate governance
should be enhanced by strengthening institutions’ board member composition and member roles,
and enforcing the appropriate implementation of auditing and reporting standards. On the

legislative experience. Finally, the authorities are encouraged to undertake a comprehensive review
of business procedures and requirements with the view to streamlining them.
40.
The authorities are encouraged to continue to be vigilant toward existing and
emerging financial sector risks. To this end, they should maintain their strategy of building
precautionary provisions and retained profits by banks, continue to enhance ICs supervision, and
develop the needed tools for ICs resolution. Furthermore, in developing a new and improved
national legislative base, the authorities should continue to take into account the specific nature of
the central bank’s operations and the need to strengthen and preserve its operational
independence.
41.
There has been significant progress in improving Kuwait’s statistical system, but
further improvements are needed. In this regard, the authorities are encouraged to provide the
needed resources to the Central Statistical Bureau.
42.
It is recommended that the next Article IV Consultation take place on a standard 12month cycle, in accordance with the Decision on Article IV Consultation Cycles (Decision No. 14747(10/96) (9/28/2010).

Appendix II. 2010 FSAP Update Recommendations: Implementation Status
(As of May 2012)
Recommendation

Implementation status and details
General

The CBK, CMA, and the Ministry of Commerce and
Industry (MOCI) should clarify at the outset their
respective supervisory responsibilities and initiate
a coordination process to achieve efficient
oversight architecture.

Completed. The CMA has assumed its supervisory
role in September 2010. CMA bylaws have been
passed, specifying its supervisory roles over ICs and
an MoU delineating the supervisory responsibilities
of and coordination process between CMA and CBK
has been completed.

Establish at the CBK a financial stability unit (FSU)
responsible for macro-prudential supervision.

Implemented. Significant progress has been made
in this area. A new Financial Stability Office (FSO) has
been formed drawing from interdepartmental
competencies including supervision and macro
economic analysis and is reporting directly to the
Governor. In this relation, significant progress has
been made on the analytical front and identification
of tools that would be used to assess systemic risk.
These include a quarterly off-site surveillance report,
banking sector stress testing (developed during
July-October 2010 with the assistance of a
consulting firm), and an early warning system (EWS)
that incorporates macro and micro economic and
financial indicators that would be used to signal
sector-wide weaknesses.

Banking Supervision
Perform periodic stress tests including for real
estate and other major sectoral credit risk
concentrations, and review existing assessments of
the way banks consider these risk concentrations
in their internal capital adequacy assessment
processes (ICAAPs).

Implemented. The CBK has made significant strides
in its data collection and stress testing capacities
with the help of an external consulting firm. Sectoral
stress tests have been carried out by the CBK and
the results were shared and discussed with banks.
The CBK has completed an ICAAP manual based on
the June 19, 2009 circular and have completed four
ICAAP inspections in 2010, and three inspections in
2011. The eighth inspection is under follow up with
two remaining ICAAP inspections to be completed.

Lower the maximum exposure limits on related
parties and enhancing the legal framework to
prohibit conflicts of interest concerning related
party transactions.

Not implemented. The CBK noted that they have
started to look into this issue. Moreover, they
argued that they would like to avoid policy
contradictions that could arise from lowering related

30

KUWAIT

Recommendation

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Implementation status and details
lending limits and other policies that are directed at
enhancing credit growth (e.g., relaxing the
prudential loan/deposit ratio), particularly in light of
the implementation of the Development Plan.

Complete the migration from compliance-based
supervision to risk-based supervision.

Completed. An external consultant was appointed
to assist the CBK modernize its supervisory
framework into a risk based one, and perform ICAAP
assessments. A “pilot” risk-based inspection was
recently completed; and an inspection work
program related to risk management is at an
advanced stage, as well as a completed risk
assessment methodology.

Continue strengthening the supervision capacity
through further hiring and training.

Ongoing. An additional 12 on-site inspectors were
recently hired. Staff in the banking supervision
department have benefited over the last year from
several trainings and seminars inside and outside
Kuwait.

Shorten the on-site supervision cycle.

Ongoing. Progress has been made in shortening
the on-site supervision cycle through a newly
approved inspection plan to cover on-site work with
all banks in an 18 month cycle.

Organize comprehensive ICAAP on-site
examination.

Implemented. So far, seven ICAAP inspections have
been completed, and one is in progress. The last two
ICAAP inspections remain to be completed.

Investment Companies
Strengthen regulations on (a) licensing (in
particular “fit and proper” criteria);
(b) permissible activities; (c) corporate governance,
including requirements on internal organization,
internal control, risk management, external
auditors, and accountancy rules; and (d) prudential
limits on leverage and liquidity/maturity mismatch.

In progress. The CMA bylaws seek to strengthen
corporate governance in ICs by imposing approval
of CMA for management, board members, and
other key positions, including the compliance,
internal controls, risk management, and AML/CFT
officers. Minimum qualifications have been
established for board members and key officers are
required to pass a certain test specified by the CMA.
New listing requirements for listed companies were
also issued (compliance required by March 2012). In
view of the transfer of supervisory responsibilities of
ICs to the CMA, regulations issued by the CBK in
June 2010 have been suspended and will only apply
to finance companies that are fully under the
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

31

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

KUWAIT

Recommendation

Implementation status and details
supervision of the CBK. The new regulations set
prudential limits on liquidity, leverage, and FX
exposures and were to come to effect in June 2012.
The CMA has not initiated yet any new regulations
on these fronts.

Consideration could also be given to varying the
minimum capital requirement depending on the
activities and risks assumed by the entity.

Not implemented.

Financial Safety Net Framework
Replace the blanket guarantee with a deposit
insurance system which promotes market
discipline, including by introducing a cap at a level
that adequately protects depositors, but provides
incentives to conduct due diligence. The
authorities need to define a transition strategy,
with a timetable, once conditions allow.

Not implemented. The authorities believe that it is
still premature to remove the blanket guarantee.
Furthermore, in view of the large deposit
concentration in Kuwait (99% of depositors own
only 20 percent of deposits), a standard deposit
scheme would not be effective in guarding against
bank runs.

Improve ELA, including by broadening collateral
acceptance policies and establishing a valuation
framework with haircuts for non-standard
collateral.

Not implemented. Nevertheless, the CBK law allows
the CBK to use any collateral it deems acceptable for
emergency lending. Currently, the ELA comprises a
wider range than government securities including
traded shares and bonds of solvent commercial
companies as well as commercial paper, but does
not include other non-standard collateral.

Resolution Framework
Overhaul the bankruptcy framework to adequately
handle bankruptcies of banks and other financial
institutions.

32

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Not implemented. A taskforce headed by the
Ministry of Commerce and Industry with CBK and
CMA membership is studying a proposal for a
workout legal framework for stressed ICs.

ANNEX II. RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
(As of May 12, 2012)
The World Bank and the Government of Kuwait developed a four-year Country Partnership Strategy
(CPS) 2010–13, which leverages the setup of a World Bank Country Office in Kuwait (inaugurated in
January 2009).
The Kuwait CPS and program emphasize implementation of reforms. Hence all programs are
grounded in the Government five-year plan, and are developed closely with the line ministry/agency
as well as with the Ministry of Finance, which plays the coordinator role and the Bank’s central
counterpart.
The CPS focuses on Fee-Based Services laying the ground for Bank provision of advisory and
analytical support to Kuwait. Program priorities are driven and guided by CPS and revolve around
the following three pillars:
(i)
Improving public sector performance, with activities in the areas of reforming procurement;
improved governance including setting up an anti-corruption agency; fiscal management, including
support for Value Added Tax implementation; energy reforms in renewable energy and increased
efficiency; technical advice to stream line outdated procurement and project cycle regulation and
practices, and support for several environmental initiatives.
(ii)
Economic diversification through increased private sector development, with support for
implementation of Kuwait’s recently passed privatization law, support to Kuwait’s Oil Company (KPC)
as it implements an ambitious privatization program, TA for a number of public-private partnerships
and the creation of a more conducive environment for private sector development and foreign
direct investment, including activities with Kuwait’s Foreign Investment Bureau (KFIB).
(iii)
Human development, with a major program to support the quality of education, including
having an international expert based in Kuwait. Potential Bank support in this area would also
include social protection, labor and youth issues.
Activities for the FY 2012–13
I –Improving public sector performance

Governance TA – Phase III. This is a third phase of a continuing Governance program that
began in FY08 (Phase I completed in FY09, and Phase II – in FY11.) The scope of the project included
review and/or assistance in drafting legislation pertaining to conflict of interest, and asset and
income disclosure by public officials; advice and guidance on the creation of a well-functioning
anticorruption agency including legal and institutional framework; development of the agency’s
strategic plan, operational manual and guidelines; and public awareness campaign. Program

elements includes: (i) improving transparency and access to information through the preparation of
Freedom of Information legislation; (ii) recommending revisions to the Civil Service Code of
Conduct; and, (iii) introducing a comprehensive anticorruption law covering topics such as conflict of
interest, asset recovery, whistleblower protection and the creation of an anticorruption agency.
Analytical work under all three components was completed by late May 2011, and submitted to the
Prime Minister’s Office (PMO). Draft legislation is yet to be presented before Parliament.

Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). At the request of the Environment Protection
Agency (EPA) the Bank has provided assistance in the development of a national CDM Strategy, a
CDM portfolio and an outline of options for Kuwait to participate in an international post-Kyoto
regime. This activity aimed also at assisting the EPA raise awareness and engage governmental and
private sector stakeholders in a dialogue on carbon finance in general and the CDM more
specifically, as well as providing training to potential project proponents and supporting
identification of CDM project activities and other emerging carbon trading schemes. This activity has
recently been completed.

Environmental Compliance Fund (ECF). This activity responds to a request from the Kuwait
Supreme Council for the Environment, and subsequently from the Ministry of Finance, for World
Bank support in promoting improved environmental performance from point-source/industrial
polluters in Kuwait through the establishment of an ECF. Bank support is consisting of helping the
EPA design an environment compliance system to assist the polluting enterprises reduce pollution
to the level required by the national standards and guidelines. Such system would consist of the
design of the following activities: (i) A Compliance Action Plan (CAP) to be prepared by each of the
polluting enterprises to reduce pollution; and (ii) A Financing Window to be established in selected
commercial banks to provide a combination of loans and grants to the polluting enterprises in order
to implement part or all the activities in the compliance action plans (CAPs).

Power Sector Support. This activity aimed at supporting the Ministry of Electricity and Water
(MEW) develop an implementation strategy, a coordination mechanism, and implementation steps
for the development of energy efficiency and large-scale solar power combining the strengths of
public and private sectors. This activity has drawn to a conclusion and discussions are underway for
a follow-up activity during which the Bank will support MEW implement the detailed action plans
and defined specific projects recommended in phase one.

Project Cycle. At the request of the Ministry of Finance, the World Bank is conducting a
review of the government project cycle. The objective of this program is to explore ways of
shortening the project cycle and improving current project management practices in Kuwait. As part
of this activity, the Bank team has reviewed and analyzed a selection of projects in government
entities at three stages: concept, implementation and evaluation. This review is helping identify
bottlenecks and areas that need amendments in procedures or regulation/legislation. The Bank is
also making recommendations to strengthen the capacity of the Government agencies to
implement projects through adequate training.


Value Added Tax (VAT). The World Bank is supporting efforts by the Kuwaiti Government to
design and implement VAT - as part of Kuwait’s GCC trade union obligations. Introducing VAT in
Kuwait has four objectives: diversifying the sources of public revenues; supporting economic
development programs by making available a steady stream of additional tax revenues;
compensating the deficiency in customs duties resulting from the application of free trade
agreements; and, improving taxation on luxury items. A parallel objective of this project is capacity
building, which is where the involvement of the World Bank is critical. This will be achieved through
intensive training in VAT basics, VAT specifics, VAT operations and modern techniques of tax
administration, as well as through on-the-job training by the experts hired by the project. This focus
on strengthening a critical public sector function – tax administration – in the context of fiscal
reform makes the Bank a natural partner for the government. An international resident advisor has
been placed in Kuwait for two years to work on this activity.

Solid Waste Management II. This activity is a follow-up to a first phase solid Waste
Management program, which aimed at improving Kuwaiti authorities understanding of the current

Committee in Muscat, Oman. The objective of this activity is to support Kuwait’s efforts focus on
environmental sustainability that could generate financing and economic benefits in addition to
protecting Kuwait’s natural resources in line with the State’s regional and national priorities; and to
help establish clear, transparent and predictable environmental regulations that would improve the
investment climate in Kuwait. The activity comprises three main components, which are: (i)
Implementing a cost assessment of environmental degradation as a decision making tool for
delineating policy and investment priorities based on economic and social costs of the various forms
of environmental degradation; (ii) Carrying out a pollution load assessment as a decision support
system for monitoring and enforcement of environmental regulations; and (iii) Strengthening the
environmental impact assessment system as a preventive tool for reducing environmental and social
impacts and risks.

ANNEX III. STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of May 11, 2012)
I.

Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance

General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. There
is scope for improved compilation of the national accounts and balance of payments statistics
through better coordination among statistical agencies. Timeliness, particularly for the national
accounts, is an area of concern.
National Accounts and Production: Recent improvements of national accounts include: change
of the base year for the constant price data to 2000 and the estimates of value added for
subsidized goods and services of the public utilities sector through the use of input costs (the
household expenditure survey was used previously). Continued progress, especially in the
estimation of value added for the oil sector, requires the dedication of adequate resources and
improved coordination between the Ministries of Planning, Oil, and Finance. The IMF’s statistics
department (STA) has provided technical assistance to the Ministry of Planning to improve
national accounts and price data. It would be useful if the Central Bank of Kuwait (CBK) would
publish oil sector information in the Quarterly Statistical Bulletin pertaining to output, refining,
domestic consumption, export price for crude and refined products and the domestic price of
petroleum products. These data are available from the Ministry of Oil. Timeliness of the data
needs to be improved. In the last few years, delays in the production of price indexes caused
long lags in the production of real GDP data.
Price statistics
CPI weights are based on the 1999–2000 household expenditure survey and were introduced
into the index for a reference year of 2002. An improved monthly CPI based on a revised basket
has been published in monthly CPI bulletins with about a one-month lag. The wholesale price
index (WPI) needs to be developed into a producer price index (PPI) which is consistent with the
national accounts and includes all domestically produced goods, ex-factory, for the export and
the domestic market.
Government finance statistics: Annual GFS data are reported for publication in the Government
Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSY). The major components of extrabudgetary revenues
(investment income and transfers of profits of public institutions), extrabudgetary expenditures
(interest on foreign debt and treasury paper), and financing operations conducted by two reserve
funds are not reported. Data on investment income, and on interest on foreign debt and treasury
paper, however, are usually provided to Article IV consultation missions.
The authorities have made some progress in fiscal data presentation, but the lack of a suitable
classification of data on the execution of the budget remains a constraint on monitoring
effectively fiscal developments during the year. The authorities’ presentation is not yet fully
compliant with the GFSM 2001 guidance, but progress is being made in terms of creating a new
chart of accounts and moving reporting to an accrual basis.
Data on the operations of the Public Institute for Social Security are not made available. Sharing
of information between various government agencies could be improved. STA has indicated to

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KUWAIT 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

the authorities that operations of the two reserve funds should be classified as part of
government, as they perform activities for public policy purposes (management of debt and
assets, and financing of the budget). An additional extension of coverage would be to report GFS
in the form of the Statement of Sources and Uses of Cash for the consolidated central
government. The authorities have also been briefed on the IMF’s ongoing work to enhance the
transparency of fiscal accounts and presentations detailed in the “Code of Good Practices on
Fiscal Transparency” and were encouraged to adopt some of the practices recommended in the
Code.
Monetary and financial statistics
The CBK reports monetary data to STA on a regular and timely basis based on the Standardized
Report Forms (SRFs). CBK needs to work further to distinguish a number of investment
companies that accept deposits from other investment companies that do not accept deposits.
Investment companies that accept deposits should appropriately be classified as part of the
depository corporations sector. In the current SRFs, all investment companies (including those
that accept deposits) are classified as other financial corporations. However, the amount of
deposits accepted by investment companies is considered as not significant.
Balance of payments statistics: The CBK compiles and disseminates detailed annual data in
accordance with the methodology of the BPM6, while trade data estimates are disseminated
monthly. However, data on capital flows of the nonfinancial private sector are limited. To improve
coverage for inward foreign direct investment, the CBK is making efforts to obtain more data by
surveying direct investment enterprises. The Central Statistical Office (CSO), working with the
CBK, plans to implement the IMF’s Coordinated Direct Investment Survey in 2010–11. This
initiative should improve foreign direct investment statistics. Enhancements have been made in
the estimation of travel services and communication services, but further improvements are
needed in compilation practices and in the estimation of data on several service items and
private transfers.
A major step forward in 2007 was the dissemination of IIP data for 2001 onwards in STA
publications. However, the information on IIP data made available to staff is incomplete as it
excludes the external assets held by the general government due to domestic legal constraints
on dissemination (however, loans granted by the Kuwaiti Fund for Arab Economic Development
and general government trade credits are included).
The CBK also participates in the Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS) with data
reported for 2003 onwards, and in the recently introduced Coordinated Direct Investment Survey.
These data are for the financial sector acting as end-investors or as intermediaries on behalf of
residents and do not include holdings of foreign securities held by government agencies, which
comprise the bulk of Kuwait’s cross-border holdings.
In 2009, STA provided TA on improving external accounts data. The CBK has made good
progress since then, particularly in the substantial revisions to report forms, including the
separate reporting of financial transactions in the BOP and other changes in volume in the
international investment position. It has also made progress in the estimation of remittances
data. Yet, major delays and data gaps remain. In particular, major government entities do not

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 11

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

KUWAIT

report quarterly data to the CBK in time to compile timely quarterly statistics. Trade data are
compiled by the CSO annually and provided to the CBK with a time lag of well over one year.
Furthermore, the response rate for the private nonfinancial sector is low.
II.

Data Standards and Quality

Kuwait is one of the first GDDS participants.
However, most of its metadata, with the
exception of the real sector and sociodemographic metadata, have not been updated
since October 2002. The CBK maintains its own
webpage where it provides the following data
to the public: money and banking statistics;
balance of payments statistics; trade balance
statistics; exchange rate; GDP by sector and
expenditure at current and constant prices;
public finance statistics; CPI and WPI; and
security market indicators. Similarly, the Ministry
of Planning has a webpage where the CSO
publishes data on national accounts, prices, and
other related statistics. The Ministry of Finance
webpage includes detailed data for actual and
estimated budget operations. In addition, the
Kuwait Stock Exchange webpage provides data
on stock market indices, volume and value of
securities traded, as well as privatization
schedules and other related information.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
June, 15, 2012

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with Kuwait
On June 15, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation 1 with Kuwait on a lapse of time basis. Under the IMF’s lapse of time
procedures, the Executive Board completes the Article IV Consultations without convening
formal discussions.
Background
The 2012 consultation discussions were held against the backdrop of significantly higher oil
revenues for Kuwait, a product of higher global oil prices and an increase in oil production. The
policymaking landscape changed significantly in 2011 and early 2012. After six cabinet
resignations in the past five years, the Prime Minister resigned in late 2011 and new
Parliamentary elections were held in early February 2012, producing significant gains for the
opposition. A new government was formed shortly after.
Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth in 2011 is estimated at around 8¼ percent,
supported by a 15 percent increase in oil production. Higher oil revenues resulted in an increase
in Kuwait’s current account and fiscal surpluses to over 41 and 30 percent of GDP, respectively.
Growth in non-oil economic activity was moderate and is estimated at about 4½ percent in
2011, primarily driven by higher government expenditure—the government’s wage bill and
capital expenditure are estimated to have increased by almost 20 percent in FY 2011/12.
Banks’ private sector credit growth continued to be weak, at about 2½ percent, held back
largely by a decline in lending to investment companies (ICs).

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
Headline inflation in 2011 increased to about 4¾ percent, from 4 percent in 2010, as food
inflation increased to almost 9¼ percent (8¼ in 2010). On the other hand, nonfood inflation
remained relatively subdued at 3½ percent, although somewhat higher than the almost
3 percent observed in 2010. Equity prices in the Kuwait Stock Exchange (KSE) came under
renewed downward pressure and the stock market’s unweighted index declined by almost
16½ percent—its fourth consecutive annual decline—although it showed some rebound in the
first four months of 2012.
The financial sector faced a mixed environment in 2011. The banking sector remained well
capitalized, liquidity conditions continued to be favorable, and lending to some sectors
strengthened. Nevertheless, banks’ profits remained largely flat due to a significant buildup in
provisions. ICs hit renewed setbacks due to adverse market conditions and the reemergence
of global liquidity strains. Average equity prices of ICs declined by almost 27 percent in 2011,
which brought the cumulative decline vis-à-vis August 2008 to almost 79 percent.
Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the 2012 Article IV Consultation with Kuwait Executive Directors endorsed staff’s
appraisal, as follows:
The economic outlook for 2012 is broadly positive. Economic recovery is expected to
strengthen, led by high government expenditure—particularly wages and capital expenditure.
High fiscal and external surpluses are expected to persist. Inflation is projected to moderate
slightly due to a decline in global food inflation. Low implementation rates of the capital budget
and legislative bottlenecks could, however, dampen the recovery.
Near term economic policies should continue to remain supportive. While the supportive fiscal
stance is appropriate and has been called for in recent years in view of still-moderate economic
growth and low inflationary pressure, the recurrent nature of expenditure growth increases the
rigidity of the budget and complicates short-term fiscal management. Inflation is projected to
remain low, but inflation risk is on the upside and the authorities should be ready with a strategy
for fiscal adjustment if inflationary pressures build up. This strategy should safeguard the capital
budget as much as possible. The real exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals.
Kuwait has significant fiscal space but the country is now at a crossroads as regards conserving
wealth for its future generations. Kuwait’s non-oil primary deficit is above the estimated baseline
benchmarks that take into account intergenerational equity in the distribution of oil wealth.
Furthermore, rising public sector wage and pension costs and rapid population growth are
expected to exert pressures on public finances in the medium term. If Kuwait is to preserve
wealth equally for its future generations, fiscal consolidation will be needed in the medium term.
Overall, there is a need to improve the productivity and welfare impact of government spending.
Reallocating government expenditure toward capital expenditure would enhance non-oil GDP
growth and improve the long-term outcomes of the fiscal accounts, while improving the
productivity of government expenditure and contributing to the diversification objectives of

3
the DP. In this connection, the authorities are encouraged to improve the government’s capacity
to implement the capital budget, contain the growth of the public sector wage bill, avoid a further
buildup of the pension system’s unfunded liabilities, and avoid new measures that would further
increase current expenditures. The introduction of a VAT would be a step forward. The adoption
of a medium-term budget framework and a well-designed fiscal rule could improve fiscal
management. Finally, the phased retargeting of fuel-related subsidies to the most vulnerable
segments of the population should be part of a medium- to long-term fiscal reform program.
Legislative and other reforms are needed to improve Kuwait’s business environment and
employment opportunities for Kuwaitis. Specific attention should be given to upgrading the
education system to make it attuned to the needs of the business sector. Corporate governance
should be enhanced by strengthening institutions’ board member composition and member
roles, and enforcing the appropriate implementation of auditing and reporting standards. On the
legislative side, the authorities should proceed with modernizing legislation to enhance the
business environment, taking into account best international practices to avoid the pitfalls of
recent legislative experience. Finally, the authorities are encouraged to undertake a
comprehensive review of business procedures and requirements with the view to streamlining
them.
The authorities are encouraged to continue to be vigilant toward existing and emerging financial
sector risks. To this end, they should maintain their strategy of building precautionary provisions
and retained profits by banks, continue to enhance ICs supervision, and develop the needed
tools for ICs resolution. Furthermore, in developing a new and improved national legislative
base, the authorities should continue to take into account the specific nature of the central
bank’s operations and the need to strengthen and preserve its operational independence.
There has been significant progress in improving Kuwait’s statistical system, but further
improvements are needed. In this regard, the authorities are encouraged to provide the needed
resources to the Central Statistical Bureau.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
