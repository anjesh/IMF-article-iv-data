STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
June 25, 2012

KEY ISSUES
Context: Slovakia enjoyed one of the strongest recoveries in the region, but challenges
remain. Despite robust growth, unemployment is still in double digits. The large crisisrelated fiscal stimulus has yet to be fully reversed and public debt remains on a rising
trajectory. The banking system has weathered the crisis well, but nonperforming loans
have been slow to come down. The outlook is clouded by global economic uncertainty,
particularly risks from the euro area crisis.
Fiscal policy: A significant consolidation in 2011 improved the fiscal position, but
further retrenchment will be needed to ensure public debt sustainability. While the
government’s deficit reduction plans are broadly appropriate, policies should be
prepared to let automatic stabilizers work and complementary reforms will be needed
to ensure durable fiscal consolidation.
Financial sector policy: The banking system is sound, but risks call for continued
supervisory vigilance. Safeguarding financial system soundness requires curtailing risks
in real-estate lending by harmonizing the housing lending regulations and a speedy
resolution of nonperforming loans, including by removing tax obstacles. Enhanced
collaboration with home supervisors is essential to mitigate external risks.
Structural reform: Promoting vibrant and inclusive growth will require addressing
persistent social and regional economic imbalances. Reducing unemployment through
effective implementation of the Labor Code reforms and better-targeted vocational
training and tertiary education should be a top priority. Creating a more welcoming
business climate by removing regulatory impediments should attract productive
investment and support sustainable growth.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
Slovakia enjoyed one of the strongest recoveries in the region, reflecting its prudent
policies and sound economic fundamentals—including continued external
competitiveness, a still-moderate government debt ratio, a sound banking system, as well
as strong trade linkages with Germany. However, economic outlook is clouded by
spillovers from the euro area crisis and other external risks.

A. An Export-Led Recovery
1.
Strong external demand has supported a healthy economic expansion. Following a
deep but short recession in 2009, real GDP increased 4.2 percent in 2010 and 3.3 percent in 2011,
driven by a surge in net exports. Supported by solid

pre-crisis peak in the last quarter of 2011.
2.
But the strong growth has yet to make a dent in unemployment. The unemployment
rate—which surged during the crisis by 5 percentage points to over 14 percent—declined only
slightly to 13¾ percent in April 2012. Unemployment is particularly high in less developed regions,
contributing to an already large regional income disparity.
3.
Financial sector conditions continued to strengthen. Banks’ profitability increased, while
capital adequacy and liquidity ratios are healthy. Banks’ reliance on domestic deposits as a source of
funding shielded them from the region-wide deleveraging, supporting a modest expansion in credit.
Spillovers from the developments in the euro area have been manageable—equity prices fell and
CDS spreads have widened, but compared to neighboring countries, foreign bank funding has been
resilient, while private capital inflows rebounded in 2011 (Figure 2).

Contributions to Inflation
(12-month percent change)

4.
Temporary factors have pushed inflation
up. Despite the still-negative output gap, inflation
surged to 4.9 percent in November 2011 on the back
of tax and administered price increases and a global
rise in energy prices. As the one-off factors ebbed,
inflation eased to 3.4 percent in May 2012, but
remains among the highest in the EU (Figure 3).

5.
Slovakia’s economy remains competitive.
Over the past few years, exports of goods increased by an average of 15 percent per annum,
swinging the current account into a small surplus in 2011. At the same time, Slovakia continued
gaining market share, especially in the EU. CGER estimates based on the external sustainability
approach and the macroeconomic balance approach suggest that the exchange rate is somewhat
undervalued, reflecting a current account position above the level required to stabilize external debt
and above its norm. The above-norm current account position reflects persistent weak domestic
demand against the backdrop of still-elevated structural unemployment. The equilibrium exchange
rate approach indicates overvaluation, likely reflecting the trend appreciation in the CPI-based REER
in the context of real convergence. Meanwhile, the REER based on unit labor costs in manufacturing
has declined to its pre-crisis levels and is in line with its historical average. Other indicators, such as
wages in relation to labor productivity and the level of economic development, indicate that
competitiveness has been preserved (Figure 4). On balance, staff view the REER to be slightly
undervalued.

The external position appears broadly
stable. Slovakia’s net international investment
position is moderate at negative 65 percent of GDP
and is largely comprised of foreign direct investment
(FDI) liabilities. The vast majority of inward FDI is
from EU trading partners and is sizably invested in
tradables, likely benefiting export performance. At
the same time, the share of short-term financial
liabilities at about 10 percent of the total is low
(Figure 5). Finally, external debt dynamics appear to
be relatively robust to shocks (Table A2, Figure A2).

B. Outlook and Risks
Staff’s views
7.
The outlook is for a modest slowdown in growth in the short run and continued
moderate expansion over the medium term. Given the strong trade linkages with Germany and
its projected temporary slowdown, Slovakia’s real GDP growth is expected to slow from 3.3 percent
in 2011 to 2.6 percent in 2012 (Box 1). Growth is projected to pick up to about 3½ percent in the
medium term as the external environment strengthens and domestic demand gathers pace. As the

base effects fade and in the absence of further supply
shocks, inflation should ease to below 3 percent by the
end of this year. Unemployment is projected to gradually
decline over the medium term, as the output gap closes
and structural reforms aimed at increasing employment
take root.

The euro area stress remains a key external risk. Severe euro area stress and an associated
economic downturn would reduce demand for Slovak exports with significant adverse
implications for growth. The predominantly foreign-owned banking system could be affected
through deleveraging by parent banks, although this is mitigated by substantial local funding.
An intensification of the crisis could widen Slovak government bond spreads, tightening credit
conditions and reducing the value of banks’ assets. This, combined with higher NPLs as growth
slows would weaken banks’ balance sheets and fuel adverse real-financial loops. At the same
time, since the recent recovery in employment has been largely driven by export-led sectors, a
decline in external demand would likely increase an already high unemployment rate. Other
external risks include higher energy prices (Annex I).

Authorities’ views
9.
While sharing the overall view that the economy will go through a moderate
slowdown in coming quarters, the authorities argued that the risks to the economic outlook
are primary in the external environment. Spillovers from the euro area crisis could increase
spreads on Slovak government bonds—despite Slovakia’s still moderate public debt ratio, the
significant fiscal consolidation to date, and sound banking sector—weakening banks’ balance sheets
and weighing on credit and economic activity.

Box 1. Slovak Republic: Interconnectedness With the EU
Slovakia’s economy has become increasingly connected with the EU. Real economic convergence in the past
half decade has been facilitated by EU membership through free trade and open capital markets. Slovakia’s real
income per capita has increased from less than one-half of the EU average in 1995 to about three-quarters in 2010.
Increased financial and trade integration promoted greater specialization and improved productivity and business
practices through inward FDI in manufacturing and financial services. But these cross-border linkages have also left
the economy more open to external spillovers.
Trade
Trade integration has been key to Slovakia’s economic
convergence. The share of exports of goods and nonfactor
services in GDP has surged from 50 percent in the mid1990s to about 90 percent in 2011, with Germany and the
Czech Republic as the main trading partners. Slovakia has
also gained from significant inward FDI, which cumulated
from 15 percent of GDP in 2000 to almost 60 percent
in 2010 (Figure 5). By transferring more productive capital
and business practices, FDI contributed to economic
growth through capital deepening and total factor
productivity growth.

Slovakia’s growth prospects are becoming more closely tied
to those in Germany. Economic cycles have become increasingly
synchronized, especially during the 2009 downturn and
subsequent rebound. A simple regression of Slovak growth on
cotemporaneous growth in Germany and lagged Slovak growth
accounts for the bulk of the former’s variation, with a coefficient
on the German growth variable in excess of one, suggesting
sizable spillover effects.

Going forward, the growing interconnectedness with
Germany should continue to favorably influence Slovakia’s economy. Germany benefitted from robust
domestic demand and exports in recent years, while the EU has been weighed down by the lagging performance of
its southern members as they address enduring imbalances. Barring adverse external developments, this trend is
expected to continue, which should partly shield the increasingly open Slovak economy from regional economic
cycles. Nonetheless, the economy depends on some cyclical industries, which might amplify the impact of a global
downturn.

Financial sector
The banking sector is dominated by Austrian, Italian, and to a lesser extent Belgian and Czech subsidiaries.
Foreign branches and domestic banks make up less than 10 percent of the market share (Figure 8). Slovak
subsidiaries are among the most profitable and financially independent entities within each parent group, and the
largest parent banks are on track to meet the EBA capital requirements in June. Assets and liabilities in foreign
currencies are negligible, as are holdings of foreign sovereign and corporate bonds.
The importance of foreign bank funding to domestic credit is limited. Although most banks are foreign
subsidiaries, they use domestic deposits as the main source of funding and their reliance on external flows,
including from parent banks, is limited. Indeed, the average loans-to-deposit ratio stands at 90 percent.
Nevertheless, risks to financial stability from spillovers through credit and other channels exist and call for
continued supervisory vigilance and close cross-border cooperation with home supervisors (see Annex IV).

MITIGATING RISKS AND LAYING THE FOUNDATION
FOR STRONGER GROWTH
The policy discussions focused on how Slovakia could mitigate risks and lay the
foundation for stronger growth (Annex II). Further fiscal consolidation anchored in a
sound medium-term framework would put public finances on a sustainable footing.
Strong oversight of the financial sector and close cross-border supervisory cooperation
would maintain financial stability. And better functioning labor market and a more
welcoming business climate would boost employment and attract private investment,
promoting more inclusive and vibrant growth.

A. Durable Fiscal Consolidation to Support Sound Public Finances
While Slovakia’s public debt ratio is still relatively moderate, in the absence of further
fiscal consolidation the debt ratio will remain on a rising trajectory and become
increasingly vulnerable to shocks. The government’s commitment to continued fiscal
consolidation is therefore welcome. Policies should be accommodative of shocks and not
inhibit growth, while complementary measures will be needed to ensure durable deficit
reduction.
10.
A significant fiscal consolidation effort reduced the 2011 deficit by 3 percentage
points to 4¾ percent of GDP. Consolidation was achieved by cutting government spending on
social benefits, capital expenditure, wages, and goods and services. Expenditures, as a share of GDP,
declined by 2.7 percentage points to 37.4 percent—still some 2 percentage points above their precrisis level. Revenue remained roughly unchanged

The new government affirmed its commitment to continued deficit reduction. In 2012,
the adjustment pace slowed down amid the election cycle and unbudgeted expenditures as a result
of the replenishment of the strategic oil reserve, overspending in the Regional Operational Program,
and wage increases in the health sector (0.3 percent of GDP). The overall general government deficit
is projected at 4½ percent of GDP. The new government, which took office in April, plans to reduce
the deficit to below 3 percent of GDP by 2013, in line with the target set by the Excessive Deficit

Slovakia has committed to a 0.5 percent of GDP structural deficit objective in the
medium term under the European Fiscal Compact (FC). The FC requires that after meeting the
EDP threshold of headline deficit of 3 percent of GDP by 2013, Slovakia implement a minimum
structural fiscal adjustment of ½ percent of GDP per year until it reaches its medium-term objective
(MTO) which has been set at 0.5 percent of GDP structural deficit. Staff’s estimates suggest that
implementing these policies would reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio to about 41 percent by 2018 and
further to 30 percent by 2025.
13.
The medium-term framework has been strengthened by fiscal responsibility
legislation. The fiscal responsibility law (FRL), adopted with broad political support, sets a limit on
public debt of 60 percent of GDP by 2017, which will be reduced by one percentage point of GDP
each year to reach 50 percent of GDP in 2027 (Box 2).

than expected, automatic stabilizers should be
allowed to operate. At the same time, if growth surprises on the upside, the higher revenue should
be saved to facilitate the adjustment. Stabilizing the debt at 40 percent of GDP in the long run—a
level that would leave room for the expected increase in ageing-related expenditures and other
priority spending—would require a structural fiscal effort of some ½ percent of GDP
after 2013 (Figure 7). Remaining on course with fiscal consolidation is particularly important given
public debt vulnerability to shocks (Figure A1).

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

SLOVAK REPUBLIC

Box 2. Slovak Republic: Fiscal Responsibility Law
On December 8, 2011 the Slovak Republic adopted a fiscal responsibility law (FRL) with broad political
support in the parliament. The law—which came into effect on March 1, 2012 —includes rules and procedures
relating to three budget principles: stability, accountability, and transparency.
Stability. The principle of stability is underpinned by a debt rule. The FRL sets a limit on public debt at 60 percent
of GDP until 2017 (consistent with the Maastricht criteria). Starting in 2018, the debt ceiling will be gradually
reduced by one percentage point of GDP each year to reach 50 percent of GDP by 2027. A set of automatic
enforcement mechanisms has been defined if the ratio of debt to GDP approaches 10 percentage points below
the debt ceiling. These, in order, include: an open letter of the Minister of Finance (for a debt ratio between 50 and
53 percent of GDP), a government reform package (between 53 and 55 percent of GDP), expenditure freeze
(between 55 and 57 percent of GDP), a balanced budget requirement (between 57 and 60 percent), and a
confidence vote (when the debt ratio exceeds 60 percent of GDP). The FRL allows for escape clauses which will
suspend the sanctions envisaged for a debt ratio higher than 55 percent of GDP for a period of three years. These
include a major recession, a banking system bailout, a natural disaster, and international guarantee schemes.
Accountability. The law also foresees the establishment of a Fiscal Council with the mandate to (i) evaluate fiscal
performance with respect to the fiscal rules, (ii) perform long-term sustainability analysis, (iii) analyze the fiscal
impact of draft legislation, and (iv) monitor fiscal performance.
Transparency. The FRL limits the room for creative accounting by improving the coverage of fiscal information. It
covers a broad definition of the public sector, including state-owned enterprises, public-private partnerships and
other implicit and contingent liabilities. Transparency will also be enhanced by allowing the two independent
forecasting committees to periodically disclose the information they typically produce.
Operational aspects. The law defines a sustainability indicator that the Fiscal Council calculates every year, which
aims to ensure that public debt does not exceed 50 percent of GDP in the long term. The correction mechanism
will operate through the constitutional expenditure ceilings, which will be defined by ordinary law and set in
nominal terms for the next four fiscal years. Under the law, a strict no bail-out clause is envisaged at the local
government level when the debt to current revenue ratio exceeds 60 percent.

15.
While the focus on boosting revenue is broadly appropriate, complementary measures
will be needed to ensure a durable fiscal adjustment.


10

Composition of the adjustment. Following a sizable expenditure-based consolidation in 2011,
the room for additional spending cuts without fundamental public sector reforms is limited,
necessitating focus on revenue measures in the short run. The planned shift of pension
contributions substantially increases future government pension obligations. In this regard, the
authorities’ intention to combine this with a parametric reform of the first pillar is welcome.
However, it is essential that the reform be underpinned by an actuarial analysis to ensure the
system’s financial solvency. The proposed increase in direct taxes may reduce incentives to
invest, underscoring the need for a more welcoming investment climate. The temporary levy on
regulated enterprises could increase contingent liabilities of the government by reducing
profitability, and the bank levy could discourage financial intermediation. The envisaged
numerous changes to the tax system could raise collection risks in light of the relatively weak tax
administration.

Tax system. The tax system is overly complex, reducing economic efficiency and undermining
revenue collection. The social security contribution system is particularly onerous. It includes
eighteen contribution rates, three different assessment bases, and a large number of
discretionary allowances and exemptions. Reflecting nonstandard exemptions and collection
difficulties, the VAT efficiency is among the lowest in the region. Tax collection is performed by
multiple agencies, increasing coordination costs for tax administration. Addressing these issues
is essential. The planned unification of maximum assessment bases for health and social
insurance contributions should aid in simplifying the system. Streamlining exemptions and
harmonizing assessment bases would increase efficiency and mobilize additional revenue, while
easing tax compliance. Unifying the collection of taxes and social contributions has the potential
to improve revenue collection.



Budget flexibility. Slovakia’s budget structure has become increasingly rigid, complicating fiscal
consolidation. Committed expenditure (such as interest payments, social benefits, and
subsidies), which usually requires a law to be changed, comprises over half of government
spending. The share of social benefits in total expenditure is particularly high. Increasing budget
flexibility would thus require a comprehensive reform of social benefits and contributions.

improve the quality of health outcomes, and to finance the much-needed improvements to public
infrastructure in less developed regions of the country.
17.
While the new FRL is a step in the right direction, there is scope to further strengthen
the fiscal framework. The Slovak FRL is broadly in line with best international practice: it enhances
transparency and accountability, covers a broad definition of government, and includes credible
enforcement mechanisms. However, making the FRL fully operational requires anchoring the budget
in a sound medium-term fiscal framework. Moreover, extending the FRL debt limit to cover public
entities, including hospitals, would further reduce fiscal risks.
Authorities’ views
18.
The 2012 deficit target of 4.6 percent of GDP will be met. With some of the measures
taking effect in the last quarter of 2012, the unbudgeted expenditure incurred in the first half of the
year are expected to be fully offset. In the event that revenues turn out higher than expected, these
will be used to finance the much-needed active labor market policies aimed at boosting
employment.
19.
The government is committed to meeting the 2.9 percent of GDP deficit target
in 2013. Following extensive consultations with social partners, the planned measures enjoy broad
public support and the consolidation package will be implemented in full. The impact on growth will
be limited by the relatively growth-friendly nature of the measures. After reaching the deficit target
in 2013, the consolidation will continue albeit at a more moderate pace in line with the country’s
commitments under the EDP and the FC.
20.
Implementation risks are low. The shift of pension contributions from the second to the
first pillar will be accompanied by a set of parametric reforms to the first pillar—including linking the
retirement age with demographic trends, changing the pension indexation, and limiting the accrual
of pension benefits for higher earners. An actuarial study to estimate the impact of the planned
reforms on the financial position of the pension system will be prepared. Improving the business
climate is given high priority. The bank levy is unlikely to discourage financial intermediation in the
short run as it would largely be absorbed by banks’ profits. The Fiscal Council which will be set up
under the FRL will monitor contingent liabilities.
21.

Plans are underway to improve expenditure and revenue efficiency.



Health expenditure. The goal is to improve health outcomes, while containing costs. Ongoing
reforms aimed at tightening reference pricing for pharmaceuticals and standardizing the
reimbursement for medical procedures classified by diagnosis treatment should help lower
health costs. Savings from these reforms will be used to improve health outcomes.



Public administration. Significant efficiency gains are expected from streamlining the number
of regional offices, centralizing the public procurement, harmonizing public employee
compensation, and standardizing administration processes at the regional level.

Tax collection efficiency. The unification of revenue administration has been postponed
to 2014, following technical problems with new information systems. The government is
finalizing a set of legislative changes to improve the collection of VAT and reduce tax evasion.
Regular internal audits of tax collection offices are also expected to fight tax evasion. A detailed
analysis taking stock of current tax expenditures will be included in the 2013 budget
documentation.

B. Strong Oversight to Promote Financial Stability
The banking system has weathered the crisis relatively well, but risks call for continued
supervisory vigilance. Safeguarding financial system soundness requires a speedy
resolution of nonperforming loans and managing risks in real estate lending. Enhanced
collaboration with home supervisors is essential to mitigating external tensions. Financial
deepening is key to channeling investment to its most efficient uses.

and slowed down slightly to 7.3 percent at endApril 2012. Profit growth slowed down in the second half of 2011, as renewed financial stress in the
euro area pushed up bond yields, reducing banks’ portfolio valuation. Regulatory capital stood at
15 percent and core tier 1 capital at 13 percent of risk-weighted assets in 2012Q1. Banks took
advantage of the ECB’s latest long-term refinancing operation (LTRO) to partially replace interbank
and parent funding.

comprised of domestic loans and government

deposits to finance their operations (Figure 8). As

Nevertheless, vulnerabilities remain. While total NPLs have declined, corporate NPLs
remain high and stood at some 7.5 percent of total loans in 2012Q1, 4 percentage points above
their pre-crisis level. Banks are exposed to delinquent loans in non-tradable services sectors, which

The buildup of risks in housing loans is of
concern. The banking system’s total exposure to the
housing market, at 72 percent of total retail loans, is
higher than elsewhere in the region. Close to
60 percent of credit growth in the last 5 years has
gone into housing. And while traditional mortgage
loans have been flat during the past two years, the
less-stringently regulated “other housing loans”—
which are not backed by mortgage bonds and are not
subject to the regulatory limit on the loan-to-value
ratio—have surged. As a result, the average loan-tovalue (LTV) ratio of new housing loans as well as its
dispersion have risen (Figure 9).

Moreover, the banking system is exposed to external spillovers. The euro area crisis
spillovers could increase Slovak government bond spreads. This combined with sizable bank
holdings of Slovak bonds would weaken banks’ balance sheets, fueling adverse real-financial
feedback loops. A further slowdown of euro area growth would also pass through to the Slovak
economy and increase NPLs. Cross-country estimates for the region suggest an increase in NPLs of
1 percentage point is associated with a 0.4 percentage point lower credit supply growth.2 Other risks
stem from a potentially disorderly deleveraging by parent banks, manifested in liquidity withdrawal

or curtailing of subsidiaries’ lending by parent banks—particularly if they come under pressure to
quickly raise capital and liquidity ratios.
27.
These risks are partly mitigated by domestic and cross-border initiatives. The NBS
recently took steps to strengthen regulatory requirements for bank capital and liquidity ratios and
introduced restrictions on dividend distributions (Box 3). The supervisor closely monitors intra-group
transfers and enforces limits on exposure to parent banks. Banks are largely in compliance with core
Basel III capital and liquidity requirements, and major parent banks are also on track to fulfill the
recent EBA capital requirements for June 2012. While, the NBS actively participates in cross-border
stability groups with key home supervisors, the recently revived Vienna Initiative (Vienna 2) could
offer further scope for cross-border cooperation. Finally, LTRO recently launched by the ECB helped
ease liquidity strains of parent banks.
28.
The non-bank financial sector in Slovakia is
relatively small. The sector—comprised of insurance,
pension, investment and mutual funds—is relatively
undersized, holding assets of 26 percent of GDP,
compared to the average of 230 percent of GDP in
the euro area, and 35 percent of GDP in the region.
Securities markets remain relatively underdeveloped.
Corporate bond issuance is marginal (less than
1 percent of banks’ assets), the secondary market for
government bonds is thin, and stock market
capitalization is low compared to peers.

Box 3. Slovak Republic: Implications of Cross-Border Regulation Mechanisms
NBS stabilization package: On January 16, 2012, the NBS issued a package of recommendations to enhance
banking sector stability and create buffers. These include: core Tier 1 ratio of at least 9 percent, the maximum
loan-to-stable-funding (LTSF) ratio of 110 percent, and dividend distribution restriction following the schedule:

Basel III: The comprehensive set of reforms aimed at strengthening the regulation, supervision and risk
management of banks target both the micro-prudential aspects for individual banks as well as the systemic
macro-prudential risks at the global level. Key figures for capital adequacy and liquidity requirements are:

•

Common equity, net of deductions, should be at least 7 percent of risk-weighted assets (RWA), comprising a
minimum of 4.5 percent equity and a capital conservation buffer of 2.5 percent.

•

When credit growth implies a buildup of systemic risk, a counter-cyclical buffer of up to 2.5 percent will be
imposed.

•

Have a liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) of at least 100 percent (comprising assets convertible to cash at any time
sufficient to withstand a 30-day stressed funding scenario) by 2015.

•

Have a long-term net stable funding ratio (NSFR) of at least 100 percent (available relative to required stable
funding) by 2018.

•

Subject the leverage ratio (T1/Exposure) to a floor of 3percent (preliminary value).

Vienna 2: Given the emergence of renewed financial stress resulting from the sovereign debt crisis, a refocused
Vienna Initiative (Vienna 2 or Vienna Plus) is being launched to address in particular:

•

The impact on the region of the latest standards on bank capital and liquidity (Basel III). This also includes
assessment of the cross-border impact of recent recapitalization plans submitted to the EBA.

•
•

Challenges emerging Europe faces in managing non-performing loans (NPL).

Looking forward, the framework should also support measures for crisis prevention, for example through
support to host supervisors in developing local capital markets to ease reliance on foreign funding.
Currently the NBS is not part of the Vienna Initiative, but has been engaging with Austrian and Italian supervisors
in bilateral cross-border stability groups.

EBA Bank recapitalization of parent banks: The formal recommendation resulting from the second EU-wide
stress test requires banks to:

•

Build up an exceptional and temporary capital buffer against sovereign debt exposures to reflect market
prices as at the end of September 2011.

• Additionally, establish capital buffers such that the Core Tier 1 capital ratio reaches 9 percent by June 2012.
Plans for recapitalization were submitted by banks in January 2012. Banks are encouraged to use private sources
to enhance capital, including retained earnings, reduced bonus payments and issuance of common equity. Only
limited sale of assets to prevent widespread deleveraging will be accepted.
The following table summarizes implications of these initiatives for domestic and parent banks:

Staff’s views
29.
Strong fundamentals and effective supervisory oversight have helped Slovakia’s
banking system weather the crisis well. Thanks to a largely deposit-funded banking model,
prudent liquidity and capital buffers, and limited foreign assets, Slovak banks have emerged from
the crisis relatively intact. However, lingering risks call for continued supervisory vigilance. In this
regard, the recent steps by NBS to strengthen bank capital and liquidity buffers are welcome.
30.
Going forward, safeguarding financial system soundness would require addressing the
remaining risks.


A speedy resolution of NPLs would strengthen banks’ balance sheets and support a sustainable
expansion of credit. This could be facilitated by shortening and simplifying legal proceedings,
and removing tax obstacles, such as allowing losses settled out-of-court be tax deductible
without a lengthy waiting period. In this regard, the recent amendments to the Act on
Bankruptcy and Restructuring, which give both debtors and creditors a more proactive role in
restructuring and insolvency frameworks, should contribute to faster NPL resolution going
forward.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT



SLOVAK REPUBLIC

Harmonizing the housing lending regulations would stem further buildup of risks. Subjecting all
types of housing loans to the same regulatory limit on LTV ratio would ensure loan quality and
help prevent excessive risk taking.

31.
Close cooperation with home supervisors is essential to mitigating cross-border risks.
The authorities’ bilateral engagement in cross-border stability groups is welcome. Reaching out
more broadly to engage in multilateral platforms, when opportunity arises, would further strengthen
cross-border cooperation. In this regard, the Vienna Initiative offers a platform to obtain information
and influence parent banks’ cross-border transactions to the extent that they affect domestic
financial stability. It also provides a forum to exchange best practices and coordinate NPL resolution
strategies when parent and subsidiary banks are jointly involved.
32.
Over the medium term, policies should be geared toward promoting deeper financial
markets. Investment restrictions for the second pillar pension funds should be further relaxed to
enlarge the investor base for domestic equity and debt securities. Frequent legislative changes to
pension funds regulation should be avoided to promote regulatory stability conducive to
developing long-term investment strategies. The development of a secondary market for
government bonds could be facilitated by focusing on benchmark instruments, increasing issuance
size, and establishing a system of primary dealers.
Authorities’ views
33.
Ample capital and liquidity buffers put banks in a strong position to deal with shocks
to economic activity as confirmed by the central bank’s stress tests. The developments in real
estate lending are closely monitored and if deemed destabilizing, regulatory limits on the LTV ratio
of “other housing loans” could be introduced. Moreover, frequent monitoring of liquidity and capital
levels should prevent large, destabilizing fund withdrawals by parent banks. Notwithstanding,
domestic subsidiaries’ ratings could be affected should their parent banks’ implicit support be
deemed weaker, as was the case with the recent downgrade of an Italian subsidiary.

C. Structural Reforms for a Vibrant and Inclusive Growth
Slovakia has made important progress in real income convergence over the past decade.
Continuing gains would need to be supported by comprehensive structural reforms to
reduce social and economic imbalances and promote strong and inclusive growth.

The authorities are addressing these issues through ongoing reforms. The 2011 reform
of the Labor Code aims to promote employment by reducing hiring and firing costs and supporting
workplace flexibility. Active labor market policies are under review to improve their cost
effectiveness and efficiency, with particular emphasis on disadvantaged job seekers. In education,
reforms have focused on promoting greater social inclusion and linking vocational training more
closely with labor market needs. Policies to enhance innovation include financial incentives to
encourage R&D by small- and medium-sized enterprises. Measures to minimize start-up barriers,
improve the legal environment, and reduce regulatory burden are underway to create a more
welcoming business climate.
Staff’s views
36.
Boosting employment is key to inclusive growth. Reducing unemployment, particularly
among the less-skilled, the youth, and in the less developed regions should be a top priority.
Effective implementation of the Labor Code reform will aid this effort. In education, better-targeted
tertiary education and vocational training would spur innovation and help reduce skill mismatches,
especially when supported by more occupationally-oriented curricula, with stronger involvement of
employers—a message emphasized by both domestic employers and foreign direct investors.
37.
Mutually reinforcing structural reforms are needed to reduce regional disparities.
Regional development could be enhanced through continued policies to improve infrastructure in
less developed regions to employ underused labor resources, promote investment opportunities,
and facilitate mobility. An easing of rental housing market regulations could also help in this regard.
Employment incentives could be enhanced by differentiating labor costs by region according to the
cost of living, including by supplementing lower future increases in minimum wages with meantested social benefits and targeted reductions in social insurance contributions. Addressing the

long-standing issues, such as lingering corruption and weak property and contract rights
enforcement, would reinforce ongoing efforts to improve the business climate. Ensuring the full use
of the anti-money laundering (AML) framework could also help in this regard.
Authorities’ views
38.
Tackling the high unemployment level is an important priority. It is too early to assess
the effectiveness of the revised Labor Code in increasing employment. Reforms are being planned in
education at vocational and tertiary levels, in consultation with employers to address their needs.
39.
Addressing continued regional economic disparities remains on the top of the
authorities’ agenda. Efforts are underway to improve regional infrastructure, especially transport
links, with continued recourse to public-private partnerships for areas not eligible for EU structural
funds. The government intends to offer financial incentives for the construction of rental public
housing projects. Reforms are being planned to improve the business environment, including
through public sector administration reforms, improved public procurement practices, and greater
recourse to “e-government”. Progress will be assessed vis-à-vis the IBRD’s “Doing Business” metrics.
The authorities are currently analyzing the recommendations of the MONEVAL’s report on the
Slovak Republic’s compliance with the AML/CFT standard and legislative changes are being
considered.

STAFF APPRAISAL
40.
The economy is expected to continue growing at a healthy pace. Slovakia enjoyed one
of the strongest recoveries in the region, reflecting its sound economic fundamentals and prudent
policies. Amid a worsened external environment, growth is expected to slow from 3.3 percent
in 2011 to 2.6 percent in 2012. This relatively benign slowdown reflects strong trade linkages with
Germany, continued external competitiveness, a still-moderate government debt ratio, and a sound
banking system. Growth is projected to pick up to about 3½ percent over the medium term as the
external environment strengthens.
41.
However, risks to this outlook are mostly to the downside. An intensification of the euro
area crisis would spill over to Slovakia through trade and financial channels, reducing growth and
weakening banks’ balance sheets. Domestically, the main risk stems from a loss of market
confidence in the government’s commitment to fiscal consolidation.
42.
Policies should focus on mitigating risks and promoting growth. Durable fiscal
consolidation and continued strong oversight of the financial sector should help allay risks. The
government’s economic program now being elaborated provides an opportunity to put in place the
needed reforms to promote vibrant and inclusive growth.
43.
The deficit reduction plans are appropriate, but policies should not inhibit growth. The
planned measures would be sufficient to lower the deficit to below 3 percent of GDP in 2013, while

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SLOVAK REPUBLIC

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

not unduly constraining economic expansion. If activity turns out weaker than expected, policies do
not need to counterbalance the resulting revenue shortages. At the same time, if growth surprises
on the upside, the higher revenue should be saved to facilitate the adjustment.
44.
Complementary reforms are essential to ensure a durable fiscal adjustment.
Underpinning the planned changes to the pension system by actuarial analysis is important to
ensure financial solvency of the system. Since the increase in direct taxes may reduce incentives to
invest, the government’s intention to continue improving the investment climate is welcome.
45.
In the medium term, sizable savings could be achieved by improving tax
administration and expenditure efficiency. The planned unification of revenue collections would
aid in this regard. The government’s plans to increase efficiency in health spending are welcome,
while the planned reform of public administration could result in additional efficiency gains. The
savings could be used to reduce debt, to improve the quality of public sector outcomes, and to
finance improvements to public infrastructure.
46.
There is scope to further strengthen the fiscal framework. The recently adopted fiscal
responsibility legislation is broadly in line with best international practices and could be further
strengthened by anchoring the budget in a sound medium-term fiscal framework. Including in the
budget information on finances of public entities would improve the monitoring of fiscal risks. The
planned stocktaking of tax expenditures would help to better prioritize the use of budget resources.
47.
The banking system is sound, but continued supervisory vigilance is needed to
safeguard financial stability. The recent steps by the NBS to strengthen bank capital and liquidity
buffers are welcome. Subjecting all types of housing loans to the same LTV ratio would help prevent
excessive risk-taking. Removing tax obstacles would speed up NPL resolution. The recent
amendments to the Act on Bankruptcy and Restructuring would also encourage timely restructuring.
Enhanced cooperation with home supervisors is essential to mitigate the cross-border risks.
48.
Promoting deeper financial markets would bring economic gains by enhancing
investment efficiency and broadening access to finance. This could be facilitated by relaxing
investment restrictions for the Pillar II pension funds and by developing a secondary market for
government bonds.
49.
Boosting employment should be a top priority. Effective implementation of the reformed
Labor Code should aid in this regard. Better-targeted vocational training would reduce skill
mismatches. A sharper focus on market needs in tertiary education could spur innovation and
increase productivity.
50.
Addressing persistent regional economic imbalances calls for mutually reinforcing
structural reforms. The government’s plans to facilitate regional development by improving

1/ General government gross debt.
2/ Derived as [(r - (1+g - g + (1+r]/(1+g++g)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate;  = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;  = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and  = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as (1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Figures in the boxes represent average projections for the respective variables in the baseline and scenario being
presented. Ten-year historical average for the variable is also shown.
2/ For historical scenarios, the historical averages are calculated over the ten-year period, and the information is
used to project debt dynamics five years ahead.
3/ Permanent 1/4 standard deviation shocks applied to real interest rate, growth rate, and primary balance.
4/ One-time real depreciation of 30 percent and 10 percent of GDP shock to contingent liabilities occur in 2010,
with real depreciation defined as nominal depreciation (measured by percentage fall in dollar value of local
currency) minus domestic inflation (based on GDP deflator).

Annex II. Authorities’ Response to Past IMF Policy Recommendations

IMF 2011 Article IV Recommendations

Authorities’ Response

Fiscal policy

Broadly consistent

The 2011 frontloaded fiscal consolidation efforts
are appropriate and fiscal consolidation should
continue with the aim of reducing the deficit to
below 3 percent of GDP by 2013.

The size of the adjustment in 2011 was in line with
IMF recommendations. Although the pace of the
adjustment slowed in 2012, the new government is
committed to reducing the deficit to below
3 percent of GDP in 2013 and presented a set of
appropriate measures.

Financial sector policy

Broadly consistent

Strengthening supervision is essential, particularly
with respect to cross border risks, and to the
mortgage market.

The authorities have continued to enhance
supervision, strengthened regulatory requirements
for bank capital and liquidity ratios and introduced
restrictions on retained earnings. However, no
significant steps have been taken to harmonize the
regulations on housing loans.

Structural reforms

Marginally consistent

Reducing the high unemployment rate would
require a range of policy actions including
enhancing labor market policies, better targeting
education to market needs, improving transport
infrastructure and fostering the development of
the private rental market.

The authorities have adopted and are planning a
number of structural reforms to boost employment,
reduce regional disparities, and improve the
business climate. The Labor Code was reformed to
reduce administrative burdens and hiring and firing
costs. Plans are being formulated to improve the
linkages between education and employment at
the vocational and tertiary levels.

Annex III. Expenditure Efficiency in the Slovak Republic1
The size of Slovakia’s government is relatively small, but expenditures have been rising in real terms and
the structure of the budget has become more rigid over time. Cross-country analysis suggests that the
recent increases in health expenditure have not always translated into improved social outcomes. The
analysis indicates that budgetary savings of some 3½ percent of GDP could be achieved by improving
expenditure efficiency without compromising the quality of the service delivery.
1.
The size of Slovakia’s government is
relatively small compared to peers. While
government expenditure shrank from 52.1 to
34.3 percent of GDP during 2000–07, the fiscal
stimulus imparted during the financial crisis,
a simultaneous decline in nominal GDP,
brought it back up to 41 percent of GDP
in 2010. Nonetheless, given the generalized
expenditure increase across countries, Slovakia
remains well below the EU and the OECD
average.
2.
However, public expenditure has
increased in real terms, while becoming more
skewed toward social benefits. This increase
was exacerbated by the crisis-related upsurge in
Slovakia’s public expenditure, which was more
than double of the average increase in the
European countries during 2007–09. The share of
social benefits in total spending has also
increased and is 6 percentage points of GDP
higher than in other EU and OECD countries.

3.
Moreover, the structure of expenditure
has become more rigid. The share of committed
expenditure (such as interest payments, social
benefits, and subsidies) rose from 47 percent of total
expenditure in the late 1990s to 53 percent in 2009—
well above the European average. Since committed
expenditures usually require a law to be changed,
they limit the scope for discretionary changes in the

budget, complicating fiscal consolidation.
4.
Cross-country analysis indicates that Slovakia’s public expenditure has become less
efficient over time. The analysis implies that substantial budgetary savings can be achieved without
undermining the quality of service delivery. Expenditure efficiency is assessed by applying a Data
Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to education and health expenditure in the OECD and EU countries. Based
on cross-country data, the DEA model estimates the efficiency frontier for each type of expenditure, by
comparing the conversion rates of public spending into socially valuable outcomes (such as literacy in
education and longer life in health). The countries defining the frontier are the most efficient in using
public spending to achieve socially beneficial outcomes. Slovakia’s conversion rate is then compared
to that of other countries, while its distance from the frontier determines the size of potential savings.

Education. Slovakia spends significantly less on education compared to other EU-OECD countries
(3.8 against 5.1 percent of GDP during 2005-09). Moreover, education spending dropped in 2008 in

efficiency did not materialize. The text figure shows the scatter plot of health expenditures per
capita against life expectancy in 2005–08. Cyprus, Malta, Mexico, Israel, and Japan define the
efficiency frontier. The analysis suggests that Slovakia is less efficient than the sample average and
could use 64 percent less resources to achieve the same output in health care. This implies a
potential savings of 3½ percent of GDP. Applying the same analysis to the previous five-year
period points to a worsening of the Slovak efficiency score over time. During 2000-04, the
potential budgetary savings are estimated at 3 percent of GDP—0.5 percent of GDP less than
during 2005-09.
5.
Overall, the above analysis implies potential budgetary savings of 3½ percent of GDP
through improvements in expenditure efficiency. Cross-country experience suggests a number of
reforms that could be implemented to increase expenditure efficiency. While the education sector
makes an efficient use of resources, additional efficiency gains could be achieved by making the
budget more responsive to educational needs. For example, a falling number of students in primary
and secondary education could result in significant savings, which could be used to improve the
effectiveness of education and to target students in most need (including through greater
education/employment linkages). This could be facilitated by taking a medium-term approach to the
budget (as in the Czech Republic, Estonia, and Romania), which would help to allocate resources more
efficiently through multi-year goal-setting and planning. In the health sector, reforms aimed at a
greater involvement of the private sector (as in Australia, Canada, and France), enhanced competition
(as in Germany and Japan), and increased cost sharing and strengthened cost-effective incentives for
practitioners (as in Germany and Finland) would improve efficiency.

Annex IV. Cross-Border Financial Linkages1
Given the high share of domestic deposits in banks’ liabilities, Slovakia’s private credit and GDP growth are
relatively resilient to changes in foreign funding. However, the banking system is exposed to a number of
external risks, including a worsening of the euro area crisis, deleveraging by parent banks, and asset price
impairment triggered by widening sovereign bond spreads. Prudent regulation, international supervisory
coordination as well as strong economic policies are essential to mitigate these risks.
Reliance on foreign funding
1.
The banking sector is largely foreignowned. Almost 99 percent of the banking sector’s
assets are controlled by subsidiaries or branches of
foreign banks. The total exposure of BIS-reporting
banks to Slovakia, through branches, subsidiaries and
direct cross-border credit, is close to 100 percent of
GDP, slightly above the median of the broad CESEE
region. Local subsidiaries of mainly Austrian, Italian,
and Belgian parent banks make up most of the
market, leaving less than 10 percent of the system’s
assets under control of foreign branches and
domestic banks.

region, with exposure at around 13 percent of GDP. Some 26 percent of government bonds are held by

3.
Funding from foreign banks to Slovakia has
been growing at a more moderate pace than
elsewhere in the region. Following Slovakia’s entry into
the euro zone in 2009, foreign funding fell sharply, partly
because there was a prior build-up of exposure in
expectation of currency appreciation and an interest rate
increase. With the euro adoption in 2009 Q1, a large
share of the exposure was rolled back, but gradually
resumed thereafter and remained largely stable.

4.
Given its strong linkages with Europe, Slovakia’s economy could be affected by crossborder spillovers. Thus, it is important to quantify the strength of possible spillover effects from the
various channels of cross-border transmission. For example, a withdrawal of foreign funds could reduce
domestic credit, with negative knock-on effects on domestic demand and GDP.
5.
Staff estimates show that private credit is relatively resilient to changes in foreign funding.
An increase in foreign funding by 1 percentage point of GDP is associated with a 0.1 ppt increase in
domestic private credit relative to GDP in the same quarter, somewhat lower than the corresponding
estimate for the CESEE region (at 0.4 ppt). After a year, the pass-through is less than 0.5 ppt for Slovakia
and 0.8 ppt for the region.2 The result for Slovakia is summarized by plotting the path of the implied
cumulative dynamic multiplier from foreign funding to private credit.
6.
This relative resilience is largely explained by the dominant role of domestic deposits in
bank funding. In fact, the deposit-to-loan ratio of the Slovak banking sector has been largely stable,
exceeding 100 percent, and is among the highest in the region. The high deposit-to-loan ratio also
explains the large difference between the total foreign claims from the consolidated banking statistics
and effective reliance on foreign funding indicated by the locational banking statistics of the BIS.
Other cross-border spillover channels and risks
7.

Intensification of the euro area crisis. The strong trade and financial linkages with the Euro area
imply that a slowdown in economic activity of trading partners could have significant knock-on
effects on Slovakia’s growth. Lower external demand and corporate profitability will likely increase
NPLs, weakening banks’ balance sheets. The subsequent increase in risk aversion, accompanied by
tighter lending standards could lead to an adverse feedback loop between the real and the financial

sectors. The effects of a credit crunch could be severe given the lack of funding substitutes (through
bond or equity issuance) for firms.


Asset price impairment. Apart from the potential effect on domestic credit, an intensification of the
euro zone debt crisis could widen bond spreads across all countries in the euro area, despite of the
relatively sound economic fundamentals in Slovakia. This, in turn, could weaken banks’ balance
sheets, potentially raising the need for more capital, while at the same time increasing the costs for
doing so.



Withdrawal of liquidity by parent banks. Although banks in Slovakia appear to be adequately
capitalized and maintain a stable liquidity buffer, possible intra-group transactions could increase
liquidity risks, particularly given the prevalence of foreign ownership of the banking sector.

Possible mitigating factors
8.
These risks could be substantially mitigated by a number of domestic factors and external
initiatives:


Adequate domestic financial sector supervision. Regulatory measures, strengthened recently by
requirements for enhanced capital, liquidity ratios, and restrictions on retained earnings, provide an
appropriate framework to mitigate risks (see Box 3). Going forward, strict enforcement of existing
regulatory requirements and closer cross-border collaboration with home supervisors would help
alleviate the risks and safeguard the stability of the financial system.



LTRO. The three-year longer term refinancing operations (LTRO) extended by the ECB in
December 2011 and February 2012 against a broadened set of collateral provided euro area banks
with a large liquidity injection and eased funding strains. Although the LTRO scheme is not a principal
source of liquidity for Slovak banks, it was used to replace interbank and non-resident deposits,
reducing the cost and increasing stability of the liquidity positions. The scheme also provides support
to euro area parent banks, which benefits Slovakia by mitigating banks’ group-wide deleveraging
pressures and improving investor confidence in the region.



Vienna 2. The recent re-launching of the Vienna Initiative, by involving major stakeholders of
emerging Europe’s financial system and with a strong focus on cross-border cooperation, represents
an important mitigating factor, provided consistent implementation of agreed principles can be
ensured.



Strong economic fundamentals. The relatively stable and profitable banking sector, as well as solid
macroeconomic performance, differentiates Slovakia favorably in terms of investor confidence
compared to other markets in the region—potentially promoting more stable capital flows. This
underscores the importance of maintaining sound economic policies, including sustainable public
finances and structural reforms supportive of employment and growth.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Coverage, periodicity, and timeliness of data provided to the Fund are adequate for
surveillance purposes. From the point of view of macroeconomic analysis and policy making, significant
data improvements have been made in recent years, particularly in the national accounts. A data ROSC
mission during February–March 2004 found that the integrity, methodological soundness, and reliability of
the data were satisfactory, despite some shortcomings in the data revision policy. The main issues
remaining are: (i) weaknesses in the data on prices and volumes of imports and exports; (ii) a lack of timely
data on the general government operations; and (iii) slow compilation cycle of the annual national
accounts and lack of proper benchmarking of quarterly data. The Slovak Republic subscribes to the Special
Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) since 1996 and observes or exceeds all related standards.

1.

2.
With regard to timeliness and public access, the authorities in general follow a free and open
data publication policy. Data are promptly released to news services, and are also published regularly in
various monthly and quarterly statistical publications, and on the Internet1 according to a pre-announced
schedule. Data on core surveillance variables are provided regularly to the Fund, and with minimal lags: a
week or less for foreign exchange reserves; a day for monthly state budget implementation data; 10 days
to a month for consumer prices, reserve money, broad money, and interest rates; two months for foreign
trade data; and about three months for other fiscal, balance of payments, and national accounts data.

Real Sector and Prices
Significant progress has been made in the compilation of the national accounts statistics.
However, the quarterly national accounts data on expenditures exhibit weaknesses and there is a significant
statistical discrepancy between the supply side and the demand side. An important outstanding issue is the
compilation of reliable price deflators for imports and exports that would enable better decomposition into
volume and price changes. The unit value trade price indices—on which the national accounts trade price
deflators are based—are published with long delays and are not appropriately adjusted for quality
changes. The statistical authorities are aware of these issues and improvements are pending.

3.

In the public enterprise sector, the line ministries could usefully produce systematic accounts of the
financial positions of the public enterprises under their purview.

4.

Fiscal Sector
General government statistics are compiled annually in accordance with the methodology of
the ESA95, and disseminated on the Ministry of Finance (MOF) website. In accordance with the EU
acquis communautaire, the authorities report semi-annually on general government net lending/borrowing
on ESA95 basis. Monthly reconciliation of government operations above and below-the-line is restricted to

January 2004. The new system has improved fiscal control and public debt management by allowing the
recording of expenditures at the planning and commitment stages.
The MOF has converted its fiscal accounts to ESA95 standards. The MOF compiles Government
Finance Statistics according to the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001) analytical
framework; data are available and disseminated on a cash basis for 1996–2005, and on an accrual basis
for 2003–09.

External Sector
External sector statistics are of good quality, and are reported on a timely basis to the Fund.
However, the errors and omissions in the Balance of Payment statistics are relatively large. The statistical
authorities are aware of this issue and are addressing it.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with the
Slovak Republic
On July 11, 2012 the Executive Board of the IMF concluded the Article IV consultation with the
Slovak Republic, and considered and endorsed the staff appraisal.1
Background
Strong exports supported a healthy economic expansion with real GDP growing 3.3 percent
in 2011. The robust performance of net exports offset the contraction in domestic demand amid
fiscal consolidation and volatile consumer confidence. The strong economic performance
continued into the first quarter of 2012 on the back of expanding auto production. All in all,
Slovakia’s post-crisis economic performance has been among the strongest in the euro area,
with real GDP surpassing its pre-crisis peak in the last quarter of 2011.
However, the strong growth has yet to put a dent in unemployment. The unemployment rate—
which surged during the crisis by 5 percentage points to over 14 percent—declined only slightly
to 13¾ percent in April 2012. Unemployment is particularly high in less developed regions,
contributing to an already large regional income disparity.
Despite the still-negative output gap, inflation surged to 4.7 percent in 2011 on the back of an
increase in tax and administered price and a global rise in energy prices. As these one-off
factors ebbed, inflation eased to 3.4 percent in May 2012, but remains among the highest in the
EU.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summing ups can be found here:

Financial sector conditions continued to strengthen. Banks’ profitability increased, and capital
adequacy ratios rose to 15 percent of risk-weighted assets throughout 2011. Banks’ reliance on
domestic deposits as a source of funding shielded them from the developments in the euro
area, including a region-wide deleveraging, and supported a modest expansion in credit.
A frontloaded fiscal consolidation reduced the 2011 headline deficit by 3 percentage points to
4¾ percent of GDP. The underlying fiscal deficit, excluding one-off payments, declined to
4.4 percent of GDP. Despite the sizable deficit reduction, public sector debt climbed up another
3 percentage points, reaching 44 percent of GDP at the end of 2011. A fiscal responsibility law,
which sets limits on public debt—60 percent of GDP until 2017 and gradually declining to
50 percent of GDP by 2027—was adopted in December 2011 with broad political support.
The growth outlook is for a modest slowdown in 2012 and a moderate expansion over the
medium term. Reflecting a worsened external environment, Slovakia’s real GDP growth is
expected to slow to 2.6 percent in 2012, before picking up to 3¼ percent next year as external
environment strengthens. As the base effects fade and in the absence of further supply shocks,
inflation would ease to below 3 percent by the end of the year. However, the euro zone stress
remains a key external risk. Renewed severe strains in Europe could precipitate a global
downturn and reduce demand for Slovak exports with significant adverse implications for
growth.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the prudent macroeconomic policies and sound fundamentals
that have underpinned a strong recovery for the Slovak economy. However, Directors
considered that external risks, high fiscal deficits, and the double-digit unemployment rate pose
significant policy challenges for the period ahead. They concurred that further fiscal adjustment,
heightened oversight of the financial sector, and stepped up structural reforms remain essential
to mitigate downside risks and bolster growth prospects.
Directors supported the authorities’ consolidation strategy to achieve fiscal sustainability. They
considered that the planned measures appear to strike the appropriate balance between
safeguarding fiscal solvency and supporting economic activity. More broadly, Directors
encouraged the authorities to develop a robust medium-term fiscal framework, building on the
recently adopted Fiscal Responsibility Law. In this regard, Directors welcomed the
government’s plans to reform the public administration, strengthen tax administration, and
increase the efficiency of public spending, including on healthcare. They also stressed the
importance of safeguarding the solvency of the pension system by grounding prospective
changes on actuarial analysis.
Directors noted that the banking system appears sound, but emphasized the need for continued
supervisory vigilance. They welcomed recent steps to strengthen banks’ capital and liquidity
buffers, but stressed that enhanced cooperation with home supervisors is essential to curb
cross-border risks. Directors also recommended subjecting all types of housing loans to the

3

same prudential norms to help prevent excessive risk-taking, while removing tax obstacles that
could delay the resolution of non-performing loans.
Directors underscored the importance of deeper structural reforms, in particular to boost
employment and address regional disparities. They noted that an effective implementation of
the reformed labor code could help reduce unemployment, and welcomed plans to foster the
development of disadvantaged regions. Improving vocational education and the incentives to
work would help address labor markets rigidities. Directors also welcomed the authorities’
intention to further strengthen the business climate to attract investment.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat
Reader to view this pdf file) for the 2012 Article IV Consultation with the Slovak republic is also
available.
