EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background
•

Sierra Leone has made steady progress in consolidating peace and the successful conduct
of the general elections in July 2007 would further secure stability.

•

Despite strong growth in the past 5 years—one of the strongest in the region—GDP per
capita remains well below the average for sub-Saharan Africa, poverty is widespread, and
Sierra Leone ranks next to last in the UNDP’s Human Development Index.

Article IV issues. The discussions focused on four challenges:
•

Sustaining higher economic growth and reducing poverty. Sierra Leone needs to
address key impediments in order to sustain high economic growth rates over the medium
term and progress toward achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). There
was broad agreement that improving the regulatory framework and strengthening property
rights would be critical. However, the authorities were also considering targeted tax
incentives, while staff stressed the case for a level playing field for all investors.

•

Achieving fiscal and external debt sustainability. In view of the sizeable financing
needs, fiscal sustainability requires raising the domestic revenue-to-GDP ratio, which is
among the lowest for sub-Saharan African post-conflict countries. The challenges for the
government are formidable given that the National Revenue Authority (NRA) is still at an
early development stage and tax compliance remains low, underscoring the need to
modernize and strengthen the NRA. As concerns external debt sustainability, debt levels
will fall sharply after the provision of debt relief under the enhanced HIPC Initiative and
MDRI. The authorities concurred that future borrowing should be limited to concessional
terms, to avoid another build up of unsustainable debt.

•

Promoting good governance and transparency. Sierra Leone has made progress in
improving governance and transparency, but much remains to be done, particularly in the
area of governance. The government has committed under the Improved Governance and
Accountability Pact (IGAP) to implement reforms in ten critical areas by July 2007.
Sustained progress in implementing the IGAP will be critical, as it would, among other,
enhance the predictability of budget support.

•

Deepening financial intermediation. Given the underdeveloped state of the financial
sector, reforms guided by the recommendations of the recent Financial Sector Assessment
Program should be given high priority. The authorities concurred that these reforms should
address identified vulnerabilities and promote rural financial intermediation.

Program issues. The PRGF-supported program is broadly on track and the objectives of the
2006 and 2007 programs should be achievable. All quantitative performance criteria through
end-June 2006 were met, but the structural performance criterion on the updating and auditing
of the civil service database was missed. The staff recommends approval of the authorities’
request for a waiver of the nonobservance of the structural performance criterion and
completion of the first review of the PRGF arrangement.

I. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
1.
The 2006 Article IV consultation is taking place as Sierra Leone is at a critical
juncture. Having completed the post-conflict recovery phase it aims to achieve higher and
sustainable economic growth for poverty reduction. Sierra Leone is set to benefit from debt
relief under the enhanced HIPC Initiative and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI)
when the Executive Board completes the first review of the PRGF arrangement, making
more resources available for poverty reduction.
2.
Sierra Leone’s record in implementing Fund policy advice has been mixed
(Box 1). Past Article IV recommendations1 have been implemented with a varying degree of
success and progress with respect to some others has been limited, owing to weak
administrative capacity.

Recommendations and Status of Implementation
Advice

Status

Mobilize domestic revenue to meet the demands of
economic reconstruction.

The National Revenue Authority (NRA) had implemented measures to
enhance domestic revenue collections, expected to increase domestic
revenue by 0.6 percentage points of GDP in 2006.

Strengthen public expenditure management (PEM)
and budget execution, and adopt a medium-term
budgetary framework (MTEF) consistent with the
PRSP priorities.

A number of actions to strengthen PFM were taken in 2005–06. The
formulation and execution of the budget is now done in the context of
the MTEF. PRSP priorities are also reflected in the MTEF.

Expedite civil service reform.

Limited progress made; overruns on the wage bill a recurring problem.

Implement recommendations of the 2002 and 2005
safeguards assessments.

While some progress has been made in implementation, further
improvements are necessary in financial reporting and in strengthening
Bank of Sierra Leone’s (BSL) internal controls.

Address governance issues and improve
transparency.

Government and donors providing direct budget support have signed
the Integrated Governance and Accountability Pact that moves forward
governance and accountability reforms.

Strengthen Statistics Sierra Leone (SSL) and
improve the statistical base.

Budget allocations increased in the 2007 budget, but SSL has yet to
develop a comprehensive strategy (Statistical Master Plan).

3.
Sierra Leone’s main economic indicators lag behind the average for subSaharan Africa (Figure 1), underscoring the magnitude of the efforts needed to achieve
the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Despite some of the strongest growth in the
region in the past five years, GDP per capita remains well below the average for sub-Saharan

6

Africa and other postconflict countries. Poverty is widespread,2 and Sierra Leone ranks next
to last in the UNDP’s Human Development Index (176 out of 177).
4.
Sierra Leone has made steady progress in consolidating peace. The security
situation appears to be largely under control even though the UN peacekeeping force was
withdrawn at end-2005. A newly-created UN Peacebuilding Commission (PBC) has selected
Sierra Leone and Burundi to help them consolidate peace and prevent a relapse into violence.
Successful conduct of the general elections in July 2007 would further secure stability.

II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND PERFORMANCE UNDER THE PROGRAM3
5.
Economic growth continued to be robust and broad-based during 2004–05, and
inflation dropped to single digits by June 2006 (Table 1, Figure 2). Real GDP grew by
over 7 percent per annum in 2004–05, reflecting increased activity in the agriculture, mining,
construction, and the services sectors. Annual average inflation declined moderately to
12.1 percent in 2005 as the fiscal stance was tightened during the last quarter of 2005. A
continued tight fiscal stance, supported by adequate monetary policy, pushed inflation down
to 9.3 percent at end-June 2006, despite pressures stemming from the pass-through of high
world oil prices.
6.
The fiscal outturn in 2005 was weaker than targeted (Table 2 and text table).
Because of delays in the enactment of relevant legislation, revenues were lower while
poverty-related and development expenditures accelerated. As a result, the overall deficit
(including grants), at 2.7 percent of GDP, was more than double the original target. The
overall deficit was financed by concessional foreign borrowing, essentially project loans
(1.5 percent of GDP), and domestic financing (1.2 percent).

7.
Under the new PRGF, fiscal performance strengthened in the first half of 2006,
improving the prospects that Sierra Leone will meet the full-year program targets
(Table 3). Strong revenue performance and the receipt of external budgetary support in late
June, coupled with lower–than–budgeted expenditures, improved the liquidity position of the
government and enabled it to make net repayments to the central bank. This in turn

contributed to a considerable slowdown in the growth of the net domestic assets of the
banking system.
8.
Broad money growth in 2005/06 was dominated by developments in net foreign
assets (Table 5). In 2005, slower growth in credit to the government and the private sector
was dwarfed by large inflows of foreign aid and the accumulation of net foreign assets. As a
result, the pace of monetary expansion accelerated, reaching 32.8 percent in 2005 compared
with 18.9 percent in 2004. However, money growth declined sharply in 2006 and was below
program projections for end-June. The decline reflected foremost policy adjustments: an
increase in government deposits at the central bank (as the fiscal position strengthened) and
the partial sterilization of domestic liquidity by the BSL through the sale of foreign
exchange.
9.
The external current account deteriorated in 2005, mainly because of higher
import prices, but the resumption of traditional exports (rutile and bauxite) is
improving the outlook for 2006 (Table 7). This deterioration occurred even though exports
grew markedly on the strength of diamond trade, as import growth was even stronger
because of higher cost of imported fuels and capital goods associated with refurbishing the
mines. A steeper decrease than expected in the volume of petroleum imports could not fully
offset the effects of higher prices. In the first half of 2006, exports of rutile and bauxite
resumed. Because refurbishing-related imports have tapered off, the current account is
expected to have improved. Moreover, because budgetary support from donors was disbursed
at the end of the month, gross foreign reserves rose to US$187 million at end-June 2006
(3.6 months of import coverage).

III. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
10.
The Article IV discussions took place against the backdrop of latent public
discontent as peace and stability have not yet translated into better living conditions for
the people. They focused on four challenges: (i) sustaining higher economic growth and
reducing poverty; (ii) achieving fiscal and external debt sustainability; (iii) promoting good
governance and transparency; and (iv) deepening financial intermediation.
A. Sustaining Higher Economic Growth and Reducing Poverty
11.
Staff and the authorities agreed that a key challenge in the postconflict phase is
to sustain higher economic growth to progress toward achieving the MDGs. The
authorities indicated that the vast mineral resources and the potential for the development of
agriculture will need to be tapped more

efficiently to achieve higher growth
30
(Figure 3). They underscored the
importance, in line with the pillars of the
25
Sierra Leone Poverty Reduction Strategy
20
(SL-PRS), of maintaining peace and
15
stability, consolidating macroeconomic
10
stability to foster an enabling environment, 5

12.
Completion in 2006 of two
mining projects (rutile and bauxite) and a pick up in services boost growth prospects.
Agriculture accounts for some 40 percent of GDP (together with forestry and fishery), but
other sectors such as mining and services, are increasingly contributing to growth. The
recently-completed rehabilitation of the rutile and bauxite mining operations has boosted the
overall output from mining. Gold exports are projected to increase significantly in 2006–07,
following the acceleration of exploration projects.
13.
The authorities are considering tax incentives to promote agriculture, mining,
and services as the main sources of growth over the medium term. To ensure a steady
growth in the agriculture sector, they have entered into joint farming initiatives with
emerging market countries4 aimed at raising productivity and diversifying crop production.
In the mining sector, negotiations are well advanced for two companies to commence
Kimberlite mining operations by 2008. Iron ore and gold production should benefit from the

addition of two new mining companies in 2007. The authorities indicated that given the
postconflict “stigma” still affecting investors’ perception of Sierra Leone, they are
considering providing tax incentives to attract foreign direct investments.
14.
While agreeing with the good prospects for the medium term, the staff
underscored the need for transparency and a level playing field. The staff cautioned
against the provision of tax incentives and encouraged the adoption of a rules-based and
predictable fiscal regime that will apply uniformly to all companies. The authorities agreed to
reconsider their position in the context of a private sector development program being
implemented with assistance from the U.K. Department of International Development
(DfID).
15.
Lack of a reliable supply of power and the poor condition of road networks
severely inhibit growth and have to be given high priority.5 This view was shared both by
the authorities and the stakeholders the staff met in Sierra Leone. The staff indicated that the
absence of a business-friendly environment, in particular the high cost of doing business
(Figure 4),6 is also a major impediment, calling for a comprehensive strategy to streamline
the regulatory environment and strengthen property rights. The authorities concurred and
indicated that the Commonwealth Secretariat for Technical Assistance, the Foreign
Investment Advisory Service, and DfID are assisting the government to strengthen the legal
framework through revision of the Bankruptcy Act, preparation of a Securities Act, and a
new Companies Act.

5

Completion of the Bumbuna hydroelectric power project and several road development projects underway
with donor support would help improve the situation.

For the World Bank’s 2006 Doing Business Report, Sierra Leone ranks 168 out of 175 countries on ease of
doing business.

16.
Trade liberalization is proceeding in the context of Economic Community of
West African States (ECOWAS). Sierra Leone started implementing the ECOWAS
Common External Tariff (CET) in 2005, reducing seven duty rates and a maximum rate of
30 percent to only 4 duty rates of 0, 5, 10, and 20 percent. The process is expect to be
completed by end-2007 with full alignment of the tariff lines with those prevailing under the
CET, resulting in a reduction of the average tariff to 11.5 percent from 17 percent. Based on
current information, the exchange system is free of restrictions on the making of payments
and transfers for current transactions.

The BSL, de facto, maintains a crawling peg exchange rate regime and the real
effective exchange rate (REER) appreciated sharply in 2005. This has partly reversed the
competitiveness gains resulting from the cumulative depreciation of 45 percent during 2001–
04. The REER has depreciated in recent months and staff calculations indicate that the REER
is close to its equilibrium level (Box 2). While these estimates need to be interpreted with
caution—not least given major data weaknesses and likely structural breaks in the conflict
and post-conflict periods—other indicators also suggest that present exchange rate levels are
broadly consistent with the underlying equilibrium; notably, the spread between the official
rate and the parallel market rate has narrowed to about 2 percent.7 The staff underscored,
however, the potential negative impact of a renewed appreciation—that could result, for
example, from an expansionary fiscal policy—on the development of nonmineral exports.
The staff also suggested that a more flexible exchange rate policy would serve Sierra Leone
well, especially given its high vulnerability to external shocks. It recommended that
interventions by the BSL in the foreign exchange market be limited to the achievement of the
program objective for international reserves. The authorities concurred, but also argued that
they were already following an exchange rate policy largely along those lines. In particular,
they indicated that they had no target exchange rate path and objected to the reclassification
of the de facto exchange rate regime as a crawling peg (MEFP, ¶ 31). The staff pointed out,
however, that the classification, as for other countries, was based principally on the actually
observed behavior of the exchange rate, which the authorities acknowledged, had been
broadly stable over extended periods.

The spread reflects inflows of foreign exchange into the unofficial market amid high transaction costs in the
official market.

Box 2. Exchange Rate Developments
After depreciating steadily during the past few years, the real effective exchange rate (REER) of the
leone appreciated by about 21 percent in 2005. With inflation declining and the nominal effective
exchange rate fairly stable, the REER depreciated for most of 2006. The appreciation in 2005 resulted
from the stability of the nominal exchange rate in the context of high inflation. Weekly interventions by
the BSL in the foreign exchange auctions as the sole seller limited the depreciation of the leone vis-àvis the US dollar to less than 1 percent.

The staff’s preliminary estimates of the long-rum equilibrium REER are based on a model with fairly
standard fundamental variables (including the terms of trade, government deficit, trade openness,
technological progress, and foreign transfers). Results suggest that the REER was significantly
overvalued in the mid-1980s. However, during 2001-04, the depreciation of the actual REER has
outpaced the trend of the long-run equilibrium rate. With the appreciation in 2005, the actual REER has
been converging to the equilibrium level. These results should be interpreted with caution, in particular
in view of data limitations and likely structural breaks in the conflict and post-conflict periods.

B. Achieving Fiscal and External Debt Sustainability
18.
With domestic debt low and external debt relief imminent, preserving fiscal
sustainability depends on better mobilization of domestic revenues. The more so, since
the country is facing sizeable financing needs resulting from the requirements for increasing
poverty-reducing spending and improving infrastructure to support higher economic growth.
At the same time, the authorities recognized that the challenges are formidable as the NRA is
still at an early stage of development. Also, income tax compliance remains low, without
collection enforcement or effective audit capacity.
19.
The staff stressed the need to strengthen the NRA, in order to enhance domestic
revenue mobilization over the medium term. The authorities had taken a number of
measures, including: (i) the transfer of the administration of tax and duty waivers to the
NRA; (ii) additional staff and collaboration with police and navy to step up the fight against
smuggling; and (iii) the creation of a Large Taxpayer Unit. The Fund has assisted the NRA
with development of a reform and modernization strategy covering the next four years.
20.
The authorities are implementing reforms to broaden the tax base and eliminate
discretionary tax exemptions. In addition to the efforts to ensure that tax and duty waivers
are limited to statutory entitlements, steps are being taken to revise bilateral agreements with
private sector entities with a view to maximizing government revenue and leveling the
playing field for all investors. Preparations have progressed for the adoption of a Value
Added Tax (to be introduced as a Goods and Services Tax—GST) in 2008. The integration
of the Gold and Diamond Evaluation Office into NRA’s Income Tax Department has
facilitated the collection of the withholding tax for diamond exporters and improved
compliance. The government has committed to join the Extractive Industries Transparency
Initiative (EITI), which would enhance transparency in resource revenue management and
maximize revenue collected from the mining sector.
21.
The staff took the view that reining in the wage bill and improving control of
wage expenditures needed to be addressed with urgency. The civil service wage bill
remained high—above the ECOWAS average (Figure 5) and absorbing some 55 percent of
domestic revenues in 2005—and overruns in the wage bill have been a recurring problem.8
The staff, therefore, encouraged the authorities to develop and start implementing a credible
plan to effectively manage the civil service in key ministries, such as defense, education, and
police. The authorities indicated that some progress had already been made, with nominal
wage expenditures in 2006 expected to exceed the budgeted amount by only a small margin.
Nevertheless, they stressed that managing the wage bill in the aftermath of a conflict is a
daunting task, as they feel compelled to reinstate displaced civil servants as they return. The
8

16

staff indicated that the updating and auditing of the civil service database that had been
completed in October 2006 and the adoption of guidelines for salary adjustments should help
the government exercise more

control over the wage bill. A key
(In percent of GDP)
component of the public service
reform agenda is the creation of the
Senior Executive Service (SES) to
generate a competent leadership for
the ministries, departments, and
agencies (MDAs). There was broad
agreement that the reforms should
enable better control over the wage
bill.

Assuming debt relief under
the enhanced HIPC Initiative and MDRI, external public debt would remain
sustainable over the medium term, provided that macroeconomic policies remain
adequate and the authorities implement a prudent external financing strategy. After the
receipt of final debt relief under the enhanced HIPC Initiative and the MDRI, the NPV of
external debt-to-GDP and debt-to-export ratios would decline to 10 percent and 47 percent,
respectively by end-2007, well below the enhanced HIPC and the policy-dependent debtburden thresholds of the Debt Sustainability Framework (DSF).9 While this creates room for
some build up of debt, the staff stressed the need for prudent borrowing policy and the
strengthening of debt management capacity to avoid another build up of unsustainable debt.
The authorities renewed their commitment to seek grants and highly concessional loans from
development partners (MEFP, ¶ 32).
C. Promoting Good Governance and Transparency
23.
The authorities recognized the need to make progress in improving governance
and are taking actions. Sierra Leone has made some progress in improving the quality of
governance since the end of the war in January 2002. However, perception remains that
governance is weak and corruption wide-spread,10 and there was broad agreement that this
hindered economic development and poverty reduction. The mission welcomed, therefore,

Debt Relief Initiative, page 75.

Transparency International, which ranks Sierra Leone on place 126 out of 158 countries surveyed in 2005,
and data from Governance Matters show a worsening in the occurrence of corruption from 2002 to 2004.

17

the commitment made by the authorities in the IGAP to implement ten critical governance
and accountability reforms through July 2007.
24.
The Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) needs to be strengthened. The
authorities and donors recognized that the effectiveness of the ACC could be greatly
enhanced if it were responsible for deciding on prosecutions.11 Conflict of roles between the
ACC and the Attorney General’s Department could only be resolved by amending the
Constitution. To this end, the government has established a Law Reform Task Force to
review and amend the Anti-Corruption Act of 2000.
25.
Public financial management is being strengthened. Progress in public financial
management has been significant with a number of measures implemented in the context of
the PRGF arrangement. These include in particular the new Government Budgeting and
Accountability law, which restores parliamentary control over public finances and reinstates
the oversight roles of the Auditor General and the Public Accounts Committee. Key sector
ministries and agencies are now required to produce three-year strategic budget plans with
monitorable indicators. The government has also introduced a new Integrated Financial
Management Information System (IFMIS) to facilitate expenditure control and accounting.
The IFMIS is to be installed in key MDAs by end-April 2007. It is planned to extend IFMIS
to the rest of the government, including local councils at a later stage. The installation of this
new system should contribute significantly to strengthening expenditure control.
D. Deepening Financial Intermediation
26.
Financial sector development with a view to promoting saving, investment, and
growth is a priority for the authorities. The recent Financial Sector Assessment Program
(FSAP) mission concluded that the financial system is currently unable to support private
sector-led growth. The authorities are committed to strengthening the financial sector and
will adopt by end-September 2007 a comprehensive strategy to that effect, drawing on the
recommendations of the FSAP.
27.
Steps are being taken to address vulnerabilities in the financial sector
(MEFP, ¶ 25). In September 2006, the BSL finalized an assessment of bank capitalization
and credit quality for all commercial banks. On the basis of this assessment, the government,
in collaboration with the BSL, will address undercapitalization and credit quality issues in
commercial banks. The minimum paid-up capital requirement for licensed financial
institutions has been raised with effect in December 2006. In addition, efforts will be made to
increase financial intermediation by promoting confidence in the banking system and
11

Cases are referred to the Attorney General—also Minister of Justice—who then decides on the course of
action.

18

developing an efficient payments and settlement system. Rural financial intermediation is
being encouraged. The BSL, in partnership with the private sector, will establish in 2007 the
administrative and regulatory structures necessary for the start of the stock market trading.
The FSAP mission found that the basic framework of Sierra Leone’s anti-money laundering
(AML) regime is broadly in line with international standards, but remains ineffective.
Sierra Leone has ratified the United Nations International Convention for the Suppression of
the Financing of Terrorism. The authorities indicated that they would implement in 2007 the
AML Act, enacted in July 2005 (MEFP, ¶ 36) and have sought technical assistance to create
a Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) to bolster their AML/CFT efforts.
IV. PROGRAM ISSUES
28.
In the attached Letter of Intent (Appendix I) the authorities (i) review the progress
made to date in implementing the 2006 economic program; (ii) describe their policy stance
for the rest of 2006 and the program for 2007; and (iii) request completion of the first review
under the PRGF arrangement.
29.
All quantitative performance criteria through end-June 2006 were met, but the
structural performance criterion and benchmark were missed, as were two of three
quantitative indicative targets (Appendix I, Attachment I, Tables 1 and 2). The missed
structural performance criterion and benchmark pertain to the updating and auditing of the
civil service database and the completion of a review of existing tax exemptions and
adoption of a plan for their reduction. The quantitative performance indicators relate to the
ceiling on the government wage bill and to the floor for poverty-related spending. As
indicated in the LOI, the authorities have completed the audit of the civil service database
and are devising an action plan to address the weaknesses identified. Also, following
completion of the review of the tax exemptions, the Minister of Finance adopted in
September 2006 a plan to reduce their number and the authorities indicated that the structural
performance criterion for end-September 2006 has been observed. They stressed that the
delays in implementing the structural measures reflected capacity constraints and problems
with processes rather than a lack of commitment.
30.
The thrust of the program for the rest of 2006 remains adequate and the
program targets are achievable. The measures contemplated for the rest of the year, as
described in the MEFP (¶ 19, 20, and 22) are adequate to achieve of the program targets. The
staff, therefore, concluded that the quantitative performance criteria set for endDecember 2006 should be maintained. Full financing of the program is predicated on the
timely delivery of external budgetary support.
31.
The mission discussed with the authorities a medium-term macroeconomic
framework, taking into account debt relief under the enhanced HIPC Initiative and
MDRI. The medium-term economic outlook is for real growth to stabilize at 6½ percent per

19

year during 2007–09 driven mainly by agriculture and mining (Table 8). Although
government revenue is projected to improve by about 2 percentage points of GDP over the
next three years as a result of measures to strengthen tax administration (¶ 19-20),
expenditure growth is expected to lead to an increase in the fiscal deficit excluding grants.
With donor inflows picking up modestly as a result of debt relief initiatives, domestic
financing of the deficit will remain in check which should help keep average annual inflation
to single digits (between 7-9 percent). Exports are projected to remain high in the near
medium term led by positive developments in the mining sector, contributing to a narrowing
of the current account deficit (excluding official transfers). After enhanced HIPC Initiative
and MDRI debt relief, the external debt situation is expected to improve significantly starting
in 2007. Domestic saving is projected to rise significantly in 2007 as the private sector takes
a wait-and-see attitude ahead of the elections, with saving rates projected to revert to more
normal pre-war levels thereafter. Risks to this outlook include lower or delayed external
assistance which could lead to higher domestic financing of the budget, thereby fueling
inflation, and lower growth in mining production despite the recent investments in the sector,
as well as a large fiscal expansion during the election period.
32.
The macroeconomic framework underpinning the program for 2007 projects
real GDP growth of 6.5 percent, while average inflation is anticipated to fall to single
digits supported by slower money growth. Growth prospects are benefiting from an
expected positive fiscal impulse from debt relief. The primary fiscal deficit, at 2.7 percent of
GDP, is projected to widen to accommodate higher poverty-reducing spending related to
debt relief under the enhanced HIPC Initiative and MDRI. The overall deficit (excluding
grants) is expected to deteriorate on account of lower projected external budgetary support.12
However, owing to a significant improvement in private savings, the external current account
deficit (including official transfers) will remain almost unchanged at around 5 percent of
GDP, compared with 2006.
33.
Fiscal policy will aim at strengthening domestic revenue mobilization while
redirecting resources from current toward capital expenditures. Steps will be taken to
protect poverty-related spending consistent with the framework developed with the World
Bank. Capital expenditures will increase from 5 percent of GDP in 2006 to 8.6 percent in
2007, in line with the authorities’ decision to give priority to infrastructure projects.
34.
Monetary policy during 2007 will seek to achieve the program’s inflation
objective and allow a modest increase in credit to the private sector. The monetary
policy framework will continue to rely on reserve money as the primary intermediate policy
12

Assuming MDRI relief from IDA and AfDF in 2007 as a stock of debt relief, the overall fiscal balance
(including grants) is projected to leap from a deficit of 0.3 percent of GDP in 2006 to a surplus of 23.3 percent
of GDP.

20

target. The provision of additional government securities to the BSL (¶ 38) would enhance its
management of reserve money, thus strengthening its ability to contain inflationary
pressures. The BSL intends to sterilize projected inflows from debt relief and donor
disbursements (MEFP, ¶ 30). It will continue its intervention as a seller in weekly foreign
exchange auctions for the purpose of meeting the gross reserve target of the program,
expected to reach US$182.5 million by end-2007 (3.4 months of import coverage).
35.
The external position is expected to stabilize in 2007, and the program is
financed fully. The stabilization of the external current account deficit is predicated on
strong rutile and bauxite exports that would be offset by an expected increase in imports for a
further expansion of reconstruction-related demands for mineral developments. The main
sources of financing include official grants, concessional loans, and the completion point
HIPC assistance, together with the MDRI relief. The MDRI debt service savings in 2007 are
projected at 1.4 percent of GDP, of

Relations with other bilateral
creditors remain unchanged.
36.
A financing assurance review was conducted as arrears to private creditors are
outstanding. The authorities are continuing their efforts to engage external commercial
creditors and have made goodwill payments to some of them to avoid litigation. No new
litigations from commercial creditors have been initiated since the last review. The staff
considers that the current status of Sierra Leone’s relations with its external creditors
provides sufficient financing assurances for the Fund-supported program.
37.
The structural reform program for 2007 addresses key challenges, especially
those relating to anti-corruption, public financial management, and transparency. The
IGAP provides a good basis for an integrated approach to take the agenda on governance
forward with more effectiveness. The installation of IFMIS in key MDAs by endMarch 2007 and subsequently in other government areas, including the local councils (¶ 25)
will be critical for improving expenditure control.
38.
Structural reforms in the financial sector will be guided by the FSAP
recommendations. In 2007, priority will be given to a strategy to adequately capitalize the
BSL and strengthen its ability to conduct monetary policy. The Ministry of Finance and the
BSL have finalized a memorandum of understanding that will address the shortage of
Treasury bills in the portfolio of the BSL (MEFP, ¶ 22) providing additional monetary

21

instruments to mop up excess liquidity. In addition, the government will convert Le
50 billion from the outstanding non-interest bearing government notes13 into marketable
securities, in order to meet the minimum paid-up capital of the BSL (MEFP, ¶ 30).
39.
A safeguards assessment of the Bank of Sierra Leone was completed in
June 2006. It made recommendations to address new and continuing vulnerabilities in the
financial reporting, internal audit, and controls areas. In particular, staff recommended that
formal procedures be initiated to restore compliance with the BSL Act by providing the
central bank with government securities to replenish the prescribed minimum paid-up capital
by end-December 2006. The MOU between the Ministry of Finance and the BSL addresses
this issue (¶38). Another priority identified by the safeguards assessment was the automation
of financial processes in the Banking Department of the BSL, including a book-entry system
for Treasury (bearer) bonds. The BSL has indicated that this work is well underway with
technical assistance provided by the multi-donor FIRST Initiative.14
40.
The risks to the program appear reasonably balanced. The major risk in an
election year would stem from difficulty in enforcing fiscal discipline. However, the
President and Vice President (the ruling party’s candidate for the 2007 presidential election)
have both expressed support for the program and stated that execution of the 2007 budget
would not be affected by the elections. Unpredictability in donors’ disbursement, which
constituted a risk to past programs, is lessened with the creation of a Multi-Donor Budget
Support (MDBS) Progress Assessment Framework (PAF) under which the government and
key donors15 providing direct budget support have agreed to harmonize program
conditionality, monitoring, and evaluation systems, consistent with the PRSP framework.
41.
Performance under the program will be monitored based on quantitative
performance criteria and indicative indicators, as well as structural performance
criteria and benchmarks described in Tables 3 and 4 of Appendix I, Attachment I. The
third disbursement is conditional on the completion of the second review and the observance
of the quantitative performance criteria for end-December 2006 and the fourth disbursement

is conditional on the completion of the third review and the observance of the quantitative
and structural performance criteria for end-June 2007.16
V. STATISTICAL ISSUES
42.
While Sierra Leone’s statistical data are adequate for program monitoring and
surveillance, major weaknesses remain. Sierra Leone participates in the General Data
Dissemination System (GDDS), but much remains to be done to meet best practice GDDS
recommendations in all areas. Shortcomings, for the most part, are a reflection of inadequate
resources for, and unreliable funding of, SSL. These adversely affect, for example, the
analysis of real sector developments (national accounts statistics).17 Therefore, SSL needs
support from all MDAs for the compilation of economic data.
VI. STAFF APPRAISAL
43.
Sierra Leone’s progress in consolidating peace and stability has provided a
strong impetus for economic activity. Continued stability throughout the country, even
after the UN peacekeeping force withdrew, has reinforced public perception that peace has
returned. As a result, economic growth rates are among the highest in the region.
Nevertheless, the postconflict challenges are daunting and need to be addressed with urgency
if Sierra Leone is to make strides toward achieving the MDGs and prevent a relapse into
violence. The recent selection of Sierra Leone by the UN Peacebuilding Commission is
welcome and could help further consolidate peace.
44.
The continued support of development partners has been instrumental in
maintaining macroeconomic stability, but the need for Sierra Leone to achieve fiscal
sustainability and avoid accumulating excessive debt cannot be overemphasized. The
resource requirements to increase poverty-related spending and progress toward achievement
of the MDGs are sizeable and donors’ continued financial assistance of at least past
magnitude will be warranted for the foreseeable future. With a relatively low domestic
revenue-to-GDP ratio, the pillar for fiscal sustainability is enhanced mobilization of domestic
revenue, supplemented by a rationalization of public expenditure to create the needed fiscal
space for poverty reduction. Actions taken to strengthen the NRA have yielded some positive
results; the government needs to move expeditiously to finalize and submit to parliament the
required legislation for a comprehensive modernization plan for the NRA. The government
16

The structural performance criterion for end-June 2007 pertains to adoption by the government, and
presentation to parliament, of a three-year modernization plan for the NRA, including a separation of HQ and
operations functions.

17

The latest STA technical assistance report states that the revised national accounts estimates do not satisfy the
1993 SNA guidelines and cannot do so without considerable improvement in source data.

23

also needs to adopt more ambitious revenue targets for the medium term so as to bring
Sierra Leone’s domestic revenue-to-GDP ratio within the average for its peers.
45.
The wage bill needs to be brought under control to avoid the recurrent overruns.
In this context, the authorities need to accelerate the reform of the civil service and seek
donor funding for the initial phase of the Senior Executive Service, which should be part of
this reform. Competitive merit-based recruitment and selection criteria and ensuring
transparency in the promotion system could help attract donor support.
46.
The authorities have launched a number of initiatives to enhance transparency
and accountability in the management of public resources. In particular, the agreement
with donors in the context of the IGAP is welcome as it is comprehensive and addresses
critical areas of governance, transparency and accountability. Also, the authorities’
commitment to ensure full implementation of the EITI is noteworthy; they should now
actively seek technical assistance to accomplish this. Full implementation of the initiative
could maximize fiscal revenue from the mining sector. Sustained progress in implementing
the IGAP would certainly enhance the predictability of budget support.
47.
Still, public perception is that corruption is high and the ACC is ineffective.
Conflicts between the role of the ACC and that of the Attorney General need to be resolved
in a timely manner, and the appointment of the Law Reform Task Force to review the AntiCorruption Act of 2000 is therefore encouraging. Amendments of the act should ensure that
cases of corruption are duly prosecuted.
48.
Reforms of the financial sector could foster domestic savings and spur
investment and growth. The findings of the FSAP indicate a financial system that is
underdeveloped and cannot adequately support private sector activities. The authorities have
recognized this as an urgent issue and endorsed the recommendations of the FSAP. They
now need to set the timetable for adopting a comprehensive strategy to that effect.
49.
A more flexible exchange rate policy would facilitate economic adjustments to
frequent shocks. While available indicators indicate no major misalignment at this point,
future exchange market interventions by the central bank should be limited only to achieving
the foreign exchange reserve target and smoothing excessive short-term volatility.
50.
The SSL should capitalize on the recent attention accorded to statistical issues to
improve the timeliness and quality of economic and financial data. Adequate resources
will need to be provided to the SSL so that it can improve the quality of statistical data in
general and the national accounts and price data in particular. Improving the quality of both
external and domestic debt data to ensure close monitoring of public debt accumulation in
the post-MDRI will also be essential.
51.
The authorities have regained momentum in the implementation of the measures
envisaged under the program and staff recommends completion of the first review

24

under the PRGF arrangement. The missed performance criterion on the updating and
auditing of the civil service database originally programmed for end-June 2006 has been
implemented as a prior action. In addition, the structural performance criterion for endSeptember 2006 has been met. On this basis, the staff supports the authorities’ request for a
waiver of the nonobservance of the end-June 2006 structural performance criterion.
52.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation with Sierra Leone be held in
accordance with the decision on consultation cycles approved on July 15, 2002.

Sources: Sierra Leonean authorities, and staff estimates and projections.
1/ IMF Country Report No. 06/183 (March 10, 2006).
2/ Includes unrecorded diamond exports estimated from partner-country data.
3/ Official interest payments due, including Fund charges.
4/ Includes mostly program grants.
5/ Includes worker remittances and transfers to NGOs.
6/ For 2006, assumes MDRI relief from the IMF as a stock of debt reduction. For 2007, assumes MDRI relief from IDA and AfDF as a stock of debt reduction.
7/ Includes investment related to the rehabilitation of the Koidu Kimberlite mine and assumes investment into rutile mining,
financed by foreign loans, foreign investment, and government on-lending of an EU grant.
8/ Includes capital outflows associated with unrecorded diamond exports, and change in trade credits.
9/ In 2004, arrear clearance operations with the EU and the OPEC Fund are completed.
10/ This reflects the rescheduling on Cologne terms for the period 2002-05 agreed by the Paris Club at the decision point in February 2002,
and assumptions of the extended consolidation period retroactively from July 2005 under the new PRGF program. Comparable relief by other creditors are assumed.
11/ Includes Japanese Debt cancellation under the Trade and Development Board (TDB) Resolution.
12/ Some of the foreign assets that were not readily available to the Bank of Sierra Leone, but included as foreign reserves, were excluded after 2005 data.
13/ In months of imports of total goods and services of subsequent year.

APPENDIX I. SIERRA LEONE: LETTER OF INTENT
Freetown, Sierra Leone
November 29, 2006
Mr. Rodrigo de Rato
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431
U.S.A.
Dear Mr. de Rato:
1.
On May 10, 2006, the Executive Board approved a successor three-year arrangement
for Sierra Leone under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) following the
successful conclusion of the sixth and final review of the previous PRGF arrangement, which
expired in June 2005. The government of Sierra Leone, in collaboration with staff of the
IMF, has carried out a review of program performance during the first half of 2006, assessed
the outlook for the rest of the year, and identified macroeconomic policies and structural
reform measures for 2007.
2.
The government remains committed to addressing the pervasive poverty situation in
the country through the implementation of the Sierra Leone Poverty Reduction Strategy
Paper (SL-PRS), which commenced effectively in mid-2005. The first annual progress report
has been issued to you and to the management of the World Bank.
3.
The attached memorandum of economic and financial policies (MEFP) supplements
the one attached to my letter to you dated March 8, 2006. It describes progress made under
the 2006 program and sets forth the broad objectives and policies for 2007. The policies for
2006 set forth in the previous MEFP remain appropriate, and we do not envisage a need for
new measures.
4.
Financial performance under the PRGF-supported program through end-June was
broadly satisfactory. The government met all the quantitative performance criteria through
end-June 2006. However, two quantitative performance indicators related to the ceiling on
the government wage bill and the floor for poverty-related spending were missed. The
overrun in the wage bill was due to a one-time recruitment of 3,000 teachers in January 2006
and the payment of a four-month backlog of salaries, and severance payments to the military
as a result of the on-going restructuring program. The lower-than-budgeted poverty-related
spending was due to slow spending in the health sector and delays in the processing and
disbursement of transfers to local councils.
5.
Whilst the government also made progress on the structural front, there were delays
in the implementation of the performance criterion and benchmark slated for end-June 2006.
The database containing all job grades and salary levels for all civil servants and teachers
was updated as planned, but the auditing of the database and the ensuing approval by cabinet
of guidelines for salary adjustments could not be completed by the test date owing to

37
difficulties in hiring private audit firms to carry out the exercise. Also, the review of existing
tax exemptions and the plan for their reduction was not completed on time. The government
implemented these two measures in September and October 2006. On the basis of the broad
progress made and the strength of the policies set forth in the attached MEFP, the
government requests that the IMF complete the first review under the PRGF arrangement and
disburse the second loan in the amount of SDR 4.40 million.
6.
The government believes that the conditions required for Sierra Leone to reach the
completion point under the enhanced HIPC Initiative have been satisfied. The first annual
progress report highlights the progress made in implementing the SL-PRS, and the
government’s continued commitment to the poverty reduction strategy. Reaching the
enhanced HIPC Initiative completion point will enable Sierra Leone to benefit from the
remaining amount of HIPC assistance, determined at the HIPC decision point, and additional
debt relief from Sierra Leone's bilateral creditors. The government requests delivery of the
MDRI relief from the IMF, the International Development Agency (IDA), and the African
Development Fund (AfDF). The government intends to use the resources freed up from these
initiatives to enhance its policy measures to reduce poverty. In order to ensure effective and
transparent use of the resources, the government will closely coordinate with the IMF to
budget annual spending under the annual program.
7.
The government also believes that the policies set forth in the attached MEFP are
adequate to achieve the objectives of its program, but stands ready to take any further
measures that become necessary. The fourth disbursement will be based on quantitative
performance criteria set for end-June 2007 and subject to the third program review,
scheduled to be completed before end-November 2007. The fifth disbursement will be based
on quantitative performance criteria set for end-December 2007 and subject to the fourth
review, scheduled to be completed before end-May 2008. The end-March 2007 and endSeptember 2007 quantitative targets will be indicative. The government of Sierra Leone will
consult with the Fund on the adoption of such measures. Furthermore, the government of
Sierra Leone will continue to provide the staff of the Fund with the information required to
accurately assess Sierra Leone’s progress in executing the policies contained in the attached
MEFP. It will also continue to consult with the IMF on its economic and financial policies, in
accordance with the provisions and practices of the Fund governing such consultations.
Very truly yours,

/s/
John O. Benjamin

APPENDIX I. ATTACHMENT I. SIERRA LEONE: MEMORANDUM OF ECONOMIC AND
FINANCIAL POLICIES FOR 2007
November 29, 2006
I. INTRODUCTION
8.
The government continues to make progress in maintaining political and economic
stability and improving governance, as the country moves from the emergency postconflict
phase to sustainable development and poverty reduction. The United Nations Integrated
Office in Sierra Leone (UNIOSIL) is assisting the government in implementing a Peace
Consolidation Strategy, focusing on the nature of existing and potential threats, as well as the
capacities and strategies to address them. The government remains committed to addressing
the pervasive poverty situation in the country through the implementation of the Sierra Leone
Poverty Reduction Strategy (SL-PRS). The SL–PRS is in its second year of implementation
and the first annual progress report has been issued to the country’s development partners.
The improved security situation strengthened public confidence and is having a positive
impact on economic activities.
9.
In this memorandum, the government of Sierra Leone describes recent economic and
financial developments and performance under the program through end-June 2006 and the
economic and financial policies to be implemented during the remainder of 2006 and in 2007
in the context of the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement with the
Fund.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND PERFORMANCE UNDER THE PROGRAM
10.
Economic growth remained strong in 2005 and continued to be robust in 2006,
reflecting buoyant activities in the agriculture, mining, construction, and services sectors.
Despite higher international oil prices, end-period inflation declined from 13.1 percent (yearon-year) in December 2005 to 9.2 percent in June 2006 as food and nonfood prices fell
during the first half of the year. This in turn reflected the improved supply situation for basic
commodities, slow growth in money supply and a relatively stable nominal exchange rate.
However, annual average inflation persisted in the double digits, averaging 12.4 percent as of
end-June 2006, indicating that inflationary pressures remain a risk, particularly as spending
is scaled up in the second half of the year.
11.
Fiscal performance improved significantly during the first half of 2006, resulting in a
net repayment by the government to the banking system. Domestic revenues collected
exceeded the program target by 0.3 percentage points of GDP, mainly on account of higherthan-projected collections of customs and excise duties and road user charges. The improved
collections of customs and excise duties was made possible thanks to a significant reduction
in discretionary duty waivers and increased imports volume brought about in part by the

39
lowering of import duty rates following the implementation of the Common External Tariff
(CET). The underperformance in income taxes was partly due to legislative slippages,
including delays in the preparation and approval of the Finance Bill for 2006. Total
expenditure and net lending remained within the program ceilings mainly on account of
lower–than–budgeted development expenditures; the latter due to the nondisbursement of
project loans and shortfalls in project grants during the first half of the year. Total current
expenditure was higher than budgeted because an overrun in the wage bill and higher interest
payments could not be offset by lower-than-budgeted noninterest, nonsalary current
expenditure. The improved revenue performance coupled with the lower–than–budgeted
expenditures resulted in a net repayment by government to the banking system.
12.
Reflecting the improvement in the fiscal sector, monetary policy was more restrictive
than programmed. Broad money and reserve money grew by 19.8 percent and 9.8 percent,
respectively, on an annual basis at end-June 2006 compared with 22.6 percent and
21.7 percent programmed. The growth in broad money during the period reflected mainly the
higher-than-expected increase in net foreign assets of the banking system. Growth in credit to
the private sector also slowed during the period. Interest rates on three-month Treasury bills
fell to 19.0 percent in June 2006 from 24.7 percent in June 2005 and 20.4 percent at the end
of 2005, reflecting the easing of inflationary pressures and the sharp reduction in government
borrowing. Commercial bank lending rates remained unchanged.
13.
Export performance continued to improve with the resumption of rutile and bauxite
mining. At the same time, imports remain high because of increased volume of oil products
combined with higher international prices. Imports of fuel rose from US$43.9 million in first
half of 2005 to US$63.4 million in the same period in 2006. Gross international reserves
stood at US$187 million (3½ months of import coverage).
14.
The Bank of Sierra Leone (BSL) continued to pursue an exchange rate policy that
allows flexibility in order to facilitate rapid adjustments to external shocks, and thus to
maintain a competitive external position. The nominal exchange rate remained relatively
stable, narrowly moving from Le 2,927.5 per US dollar in December 2005 to Le 2,958.7 in
June 2006 and the spread between the official rate and the parallel market rate has narrowed
to about 2 percent. Segmentation in the foreign market was also reduced significantly.
15.
Whilst the government also made progress on the structural front, there were delays
in the implementation of the structural performance criterion and benchmark slated for end
June 2006. The indicative targets on the government wage bill and poverty-related
expenditures were not met. We also missed the structural performance criterion for endJune 2006 and a structural benchmark. The government intends to accelerate the pace of
structural reforms to make up for some of the delays incurred in the first half of the year. In
particular, steps have been taken to speed up the auditing of the database containing all job
grades and salary levels for all civil servants and teachers, which enabled the cabinet to

40
approve on October 25 new guidelines for salary adjustments that ensure tighter control over
the wage bill. In addition, the government has completed a review of existing tax exemptions
and adopted in September 2006 a plan for their reduction. Also, an assessment of bank
capitalization and credit quality for all commercial banks—a performance criterion for endSeptember 2006—has been finalized by the BSL.
16.
With respect to transparency and accountability, the government and its major
development partners agreed to implement 10 critical governance and accountability reforms
during 2006–07 in the context of the Improved Governance and Accountability Pact (IGAP).
The IGAP covers a wide range of reform areas, including anti-corruption, external audit and
parliamentary oversight, procurement, anti-money laundering, civil service reforms, service
delivery, and implementation of the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI). In the
spirit of mutual accountability, the Pact also includes commitments from development
partners to rationalize procedures, improve aid effectiveness, and strengthen coordination in
support of these reforms. In our efforts to enhance transparency and accountability in the
management of public resources, the government installed an Integrated Financial
Management Information System (IFMIS) in the Accountant General’s Department in
June 2005 and extended its coverage to the Ministry of Finance and the Sierra Leone Police.
17.
We remain committed to improving governance, including stepping up our anticorruption efforts and enhancing transparency and accountability. In 2005, a total of fifty
corruption-related reports were made to the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC), of which
forty-two were investigated, and twenty-two of these were referred to the Attorney General,
Minister of Justice, and to court. To ensure further transparency in the prosecution of
corruption cases, a three-member committee, comprising two special prosecutors attached to
the ACC and a State Counsel has been established. We will continue to pursue our anticorruption strategy with a focus on the preventive measures, consistent with the AntiCorruption Act 2000.
III. POLICIES FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2006
18.
The focus of our policies for the rest of 2006 is to consolidate the stabilization gains
achieved in the first half of the year, speed up reforms in the public expenditure management
area, and accelerate poverty-related spending to catch up on the delays experienced in the
first half.
Fiscal policy
19.
Fiscal policy will aim at keeping the domestic primary fiscal deficit below the
program target of 1.8 percent of GDP by generating additional revenue to compensate for the
overrun in the wage bill and higher interest payments for the rest of the year. We will
intensify our efforts to mobilize domestic revenue and reduce wasteful expenditure while
protecting growth-inducing spending. Domestic revenues are expected to remain above the

41
original target of the program on account of increased tax collection efforts by the National
Revenue Authority (NRA) in the second half of the year. Specifically, the government will
continue to strengthen tax administration by giving the NRA special incentives to enhance its
performance. The NRA will collect tax arrears on the sales tax on cell phone calls. The NRA
also expects to collect increased revenues from mining licenses based on revised fees and
royalties. The government will continue to minimize the granting of discretionary waivers.
On the basis of the forgoing, domestic revenues are projected to amount to Le 544 billion, or
12.5 percent of GDP compared to the program target of 12.4 percent of GDP. Privatization
receipts are also expected to reach Le 12.9 billion for the year as a whole.
20.
On the expenditure side, wages and salaries are expected to exceed the program
ceiling by about Le 3 billion (0.1 percent of GDP) due to pension and gratuity payments to
the restructured military. The under-spending on noninterest, nonwage expenditures will be
fully compensated in the second half of the year as the disbursement of most of the external
budgetary support will be made in the fourth quarter. In particular, transfer to local councils
will be increased sharply in the fourth quarter. Domestic interest payments are expected to be
higher than originally programmed on account of the impact in the fourth quarter of the
interest cost of the conversion of the Le 50 billion worth of non-interest bearing securities
held by the BSL into interest bearing securities. Hence, total expenditures for 2006 are
projected at Le 934.4 billion (21.4 percent of GDP). Of this, current expenditures will
amount to Le 715.5 billion (16.4 percent of GDP). The overall budget deficit, excluding
grants, will drop marginally to 9 percent of GDP compared with a program target of
9.3 percent of GDP.
21.
The government will continue to conduct regular public expenditure tracking surveys
(PETS) focusing mainly on the social and economic sectors to monitor the flow of public
resources from the central ministries to districts and service delivery facilities with a view to
ascertaining whether the resources disbursed reach the intended beneficiaries. The 2004
Report on FY 2004 selected expenditures in health, education and agriculture, and was
approved by cabinet in August 2006. The government and donors reached an understanding
in 2005 that PETS should be conducted on a bi-annual basis. The first PETS covering public
expenditures for the fiscal year 2005 was conducted in April 2006. The survey covered the
distribution of essential drugs in the health sector and textbooks in the education sector. The
draft report has been forwarded to key stakeholders for review. The second PETS was
conducted in September 2006. The September survey covered the distribution of essential
drugs in the health sector, the distribution of text books and the construction and
rehabilitation of schools by the SABABU project in the education sector and distribution of
seed rice in the agriculture sector.

42
Monetary Policy
22.
Monetary policy continues to be conducted using market-based indirect instruments,
primarily open market operations and reserve requirements. For the remainder of 2006,
monetary policy will support fiscal policy in consolidating macroeconomic stability. The
planned drawdown of government deposits to finance poverty-related expenditures could
trigger inflationary pressures, thereby posing a renewed challenge for monetary policy
operations. To enable the BSL to conduct effective monetary policy, the Ministry of Finance
and the BSL agreed on October 14, 2006 on a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to
convert Le 50 billion worth of non-interest bearing securities from the outstanding stock of
Le 530 billion held by the BSL into interest bearing marketable securities to support
monetary policy with the aim of containing inflationary pressures in the second half of the
year. The authorities have also agreed to equalize the interest rate on Ways and Means to the
three month Treasury bill rate.
Structural reforms in 2006
23.
The structural reform agenda for the rest of 2006 will focus on strengthening public
financial management and enhancing the soundness and integrity of the financial system. The
government will accelerate the completion of the unfinished structural performance criterion
for end June 2006 related to the updating and auditing of the data base containing all job
grades and salary levels for civil servants and teachers and the development of guidelines for
annual salary adjustments within grades.
24.
Our anti-corruption agenda in the medium term is to promote accountability and
transparency with greater emphasis on public institutions. The government has established a
Law Reform Task Force to review the Anti-Corruption Act 2000 with a view to eliminating
the inconsistencies between the Act and the national Constitution and facilitating the
prosecution of corruption cases.
25.
In an effort to address the threat of banking system fragility, the revised minimum
capital requirement for licensed financial institutions will take effect in December 2006, with
the minimum paid-up capital for commercial banks raised from Le 800 million to
Le 6 billion and for discount houses from Le 600 million to Le 2 billion. The BSL will
facilitate the establishment of a stock exchange with the introduction of an interim stock
trading facility before the end of 2006. To further encourage rural financial intermediation,
two more community banks (Kabala in the far north and Zimmi in the far south) will be
officially commissioned by end-2006.
IV. PROGRAM OBJECTIVES, POLICIES, AND MEASURES FOR 2007
26.
The macroeconomic framework for 2007 projects further expansion in domestic
output and lower inflation. Real GDP is expected to grow by 6.5 percent, underpinned by the

43
continued expansion in agriculture, mining, manufacturing, construction and service sectors.
Annual average inflation is expected to drop to single digit levels (9.3 percent) with end year
inflation projected to fall sharply to 8.5 percent from 10.1 percent in 2006 on account of
prudent monetary and fiscal policies combined with the expected stabilization of fuel prices.
The external current account deficit excluding official transfers is projected to stabilize at
around 10 percent of GDP in 2007, owing to the anticipated growth in imports as fuel prices
stabilize at higher levels.
2007 budget
27.
The main objective of the 2007 budget is to ensure fiscal sustainability and further
consolidate macroeconomic stability while channeling substantial resources to growth
inducing and poverty reduction activities. Reflecting a significant increase in poverty-related
spending related to resources freed under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) the
primary fiscal deficit will increase to 2.7 percent of GDP from 1.5 percent in 2006. Similarly,
the overall fiscal deficit (excluding grants) is projected to widen to 12.2 percent of GDP in
2007 from 9 percent in 2006. Including grants, the overall deficit is expected to increase to
2.5 percent of GDP in 2007, from 0.3 percent in 2006. The deficit will be entirely financed
from foreign sources with the government making net repayment to the banking system.
Sierra Leone is expected to reach the Completion Point under the enhanced HIPC Initiative
by the end of 2006 and could also become eligible for additional debt relief under the MDRI.
However, the 2007 budget was formulated in the context of the projected domestic resources
and the full external budgetary support indicated by the major donors in September 2006.
28.
Domestic revenues are projected to increase by 0.7 percent of GDP in 2007 to
13.2 percent of GDP on account of the acceleration of the tax reforms which started in 2006.
The government will continue to strengthen tax administration by providing budgetary
support to the NRA in addition to the current 3 percent of domestic revenue being transferred
to the institution. Revenues collected by MDAs that had heretofore been kept will be
centralized into the Consolidated Revenue. Contrary to earlier expectations, the
implementation of the ECOWAS Common External Tariff (CET) has resulted in increased
volumes of importation of goods and improved tax compliance. The government will,
therefore, complete the implementation of the CET in 2007 to further enhance tax
compliance. Pre-shipment inspection of certain categories of imported goods is gradually
being replaced with destination inspection and this will be extended to all eligible goods in
2007. This is expected to reduce transactions cost for importers and hence improve tax
compliance. The NRA will strengthen the Flexible Anti-Smuggling Teams (FAST) to
minimize cross border smuggling.
29.
Total expenditures and net lending are projected to increase to 25.3 percent of GDP
in 2007 from 21.4 percent of GDP in 2006, reflecting mainly the substantial increase in
capital expenditures, consistent with government’s policy of strengthening infrastructure to

44
support private sector activities. Capital expenditures are projected to increase from 5 percent
of GDP in 2006 to 8.6 percent of GDP in 2007. Current expenditures, on the other hand, are
expected to remain broadly unchanged, in terms of GDP, as wages and salaries and nonwage
and noninterest current expenditure are maintained at their current ratios to GDP. In nominal
terms, the government wage bill will increase by Le 36 billion (0.7 percent of GDP) to
provide room for (i) a 10 percent cost of living adjustment to wages and salaries,
(ii) 5 percent annual salary increment, (iii) the cost of recruiting 2000 additional teachers and
374 police in 2007, as well as the recruitment of additional health personnel and the
provision for severance pay and administrative cost for implementing the Senior Executive
Service (SES). Interest payments are also projected to increase slightly to finance the interest
cost associated with the conversion of the non-interest bearing securities held by the BSL
into interest bearing securities. In line with the SL-PRS, poverty-related expenditures,
including transfers to local councils are programmed to increase to Le 259 billion (5 percent
of GDP) from 4.5 percent in 2006. The fiscal priority framework developed in 2006 in
collaboration with the Work Bank to protect poverty-related expenditures will guide the
government in the execution of the 2007 budget.
Monetary and exchange rate policies
30.
Monetary policy in 2007 will aim at achieving single digit inflation consistent with
the overall growth in the economy. In this connection, monetary policy will sterilize inflows
from debt relief expected in early 2007 to buffer the economy from inflation. The BSL’s
capacity to conduct monetary operations in 2007 will be enhanced by the gradual conversion
of an additional Le 50 billion from the outstanding non-interest bearing securities, in the
context of the MOU reached with the government on October 14, 2006, and the development
of the requisite infrastructure. Furthermore, in accordance with the BSL Act 2000 and on the
basis of the MOU, the government will issue on January 2007 medium-term marketable
securities equivalent to Le 50 billion to recapitalize the BSL and issue before December 2007
additional marketable securities for the purpose of preserving the minimum paid-up capital
of the BSL. The conduct of monetary policy will thus rely on market-based indirect
instruments of monetary management. Secondary market operations will be enhanced and
the spread in the BSL rediscount window will be reviewed to further deepen the inter-bank
market. The Treasury bill and the Treasury bearer bond auction systems will be harmonized
by end 2007. The BSL will pursue its efforts to create an efficient national payments system
and will also explore the possibility of initiating a Real Time Gross Settlement System
(RTGS), which is better suited for high-value transactions with lower settlement risks.
31.
The BSL will continue to maintain a market-determined exchange rate policy and
will conduct the weekly foreign exchange auctions to meet the gross reserve target of the
program and maintain external competitiveness. The exchange rate will remain free from
restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current transactions. The BSL will
seek to moderately build up foreign exchange reserves that would provide a cushion against

45
external shocks and continue the sale of foreign exchange to complement monetary policy
operations and facilitate the absorption of aid flows. The official foreign reserves are
programmed to increase to US$182.5 million, the equivalent of 3.4 months of imports in
2007. In view of the projected increase in official foreign reserves in the medium term, the
BSL will put in place an asset and liability reserve management framework to strengthen its
foreign reserves management operations.
External Sector Policies
32.
The government will continue to pursue the policy of strengthening external debt
management capacity and will adhere to its commitment to avoid nonconcessional external
borrowing. It will strive to remain current on its obligations to multilateral creditors. The
government is continuing negotiations with non-Paris Club creditors to reach debt relief
agreements consistent with the enhanced HIPC Initiative framework and on comparable
terms to those that would be granted by the Paris Club. Preparations for another IDA
supported debt buyback operation to extinguish long outstanding commercial and pipeline
debts are in progress and expected to be completed when Sierra Leone reaches the
Completion Point under the enhanced HIPC Initiative by end-2006.
33.
Sierra Leone’s trade policy is influenced by the ECOWAS integration process. The
country’s trade and exchange regimes are already substantially liberalized. The adjustment of
external tariffs is currently being done in the context of the ECOWAS Common External
Tariff (CET). Full implementation of the CET is projected to reduce the average tariff rate
from 17 percent to 11.5 percent.
Structural reforms
34.
The program of structural reforms for 2007 will focus on two main areas:
strengthening fiscal management and addressing financial sector issues. In respect of
strengthening fiscal management, the government will eliminate all discretionary tax and
duty exemptions while the NRA will intensify efforts to collect tax arrears. The NRA will
expand the Large Tax Payers Unit (LTU) established in 2006 for the better management of
tax arrears to include all tax payers, consistent with the planned introduction of the valueadded tax in early 2008 (to be called Goods and Services Tax (GST). The NRA will adopt an
integrated approach for the computerization of tax procedures. In this respect the NRA will
seek to introduce a software package that has the capacity to link income tax and customs
procedures. To further boost domestic revenue collection, the government will review all
bilateral agreements with mining companies and other commercial enterprises with a view to
rationalize and streamline tax exemptions granted to these entities. Furthermore, licenses,
fees, and charges in the telecommunications sector will be reviewed. Based on the review of
existing tax exemptions completed in October 2006, the government will eliminate all

46
discretionary tax and duty waivers and will also review certain provisions of the Income Tax
and Finance Acts to strengthen tax enforcement.
35.
The government will actively pursue reform of the financial sector aimed at
deepening financial intermediation and ensuring a competitive and vibrant financial
environment. To this end, the government will develop and implement a strategy to
adequately capitalize the BSL to enable it to efficiently fulfill its key functions. The BSL will
intensify the supervision and regulation of commercial banks and strengthen prudential
controls. The BSL is working closely with international donors to mobilize the requisite
finances for the establishment of additional community banks to help harness financial
resources in economically viable communities through out the country. Efforts at extending
micro financial services to the poor and underprivileged continue to occupy center stage in
government’s overall poverty reduction strategy, with technical assistance provided by the
Microfinance Investment and Technical Assistance Facility (MITAF) in the form of capacity
building of all stakeholders.
36.
The BSL, in collaboration with the private sector, will be putting in place both the
administrative and regulatory structures for the commencement of full-fledged stock market
trading in 2007. This will include the enactment of a Securities Law and Collective
Investment Schemes (CIS) to provide an appropriate legal framework for the effective
operation of the stock exchange. The existing Companies Act has been revised and a
Bankruptcy bill drafted for enactment in 2007. In the medium to long term, a Securities
Exchange Commission will be established to serve as the principal regulatory agency for
stock market transactions. Implementation of the Anti-Money Laundering Act will be
pursued in 2007, with the BSL ensuring that financial institutions comply with its provisions
by monitoring their activities with a view to detecting and reporting suspicious transactions.
The establishment of a Financial Intelligence Unit at the central bank is expected to be
completed during 2007 to provide the necessary institutional support.
V. PROGRAM MONITORING
37.
The program will continue to be monitored based on the agreed quantitative
performance criteria and benchmarks set for end-December 2006 and structural performance
criteria and benchmarks set for end–September 2006, and end-December 2006, and endJune 2007, as indicated in Tables 3 and 4 annexed to this attachment.
38.
To ensure effective monitoring of program implementation, the Net Domestic
Financing (NDF) Technical Committee will meet on a weekly basis to review the
performance of revenues and expenditure as well as progress toward meeting the quantitative
and structural performance criteria and benchmarks agreed to by the government and the
IMF staff under the program. In addition the Inter-Agency Committee for National Statistics
will meet on a monthly basis with a view to providing relevant statistics and reviewing gaps

47
as well as discuss and provide remedial actions to constraints in providing reliable and timely
national statistics. Furthermore the Economic Policy and Research Unit (EPRU) in the
Ministry of Finance will be restructured to undertake a more proactive role in program
monitoring. On a monthly basis, the government will provide the statistical data and
information as described in the technical memorandum of understanding (attached) as well as
any other information deemed necessary or requested by Fund staff in order to monitor the
program.

APPENDIX I. ATTACHMENT II. SIERRA LEONE: TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF
UNDERSTANDING
November 29, 2006
I. INTRODUCTION
39.
This memorandum sets out the understandings between the Sierra Leonean
authorities and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) regarding the definitions of the
quantitative performance criteria and benchmarks for the program supported by the Poverty
Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement, as well as the related reporting
requirements. It supplements the technical memorandum of understanding (TMU) in
IMF Country Report No. 06/183, (3/10/06) (Appendix I; Attachment III) and adds three new
structural performance criteria pertaining to (i) a modernization plan of the NRA, (ii) a
comprehensive strategy for financial sector reform, and (iii) reconciliation of fiscal and
monetary data. Unless otherwise specified, all quantitative performance criteria and
indicative targets will be evaluated in terms of cumulative flows from the beginning of the
period, as specified in Table 4 of the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies of
the Government of Sierra Leone for January 1–December 31, 2007.
40.
Program exchange rates. For the purpose of this TMU, foreign currency
denominated transactions will be converted into Sierra Leonean currency (leones) using the
program exchange rates. For the 2007 program, the key exchange rates are shown in the box
below. For other currencies, they will be converted into leones using those at September 29,
2006.

II. QUANTITATIVE PERFORMANCE CRITERIA
A. Gross Foreign Exchange Reserves of the Bank of Sierra Leone (BSL)
41.

Definition. (See Appendix I; Attachment III in IMF Country Report No. 06/183).

54

42.
Adjustment clauses. The floor on gross foreign exchange reserves will be adjusted
(a) downward (or upward) by the amount in U.S. dollars of the shortfall/excess in
programmed external budgetary assistance;18 (b) downward (upward) for any shortfall/excess
in the U.S. dollar value of disbursements from the IMF under the PRGF arrangement; and
(c) upward (or downward) for any increase (or decrease) in BSL short-term (one year or less
in original maturity) foreign currency-liabilities (to residents and nonresidents).
B. Net Domestic Assets of the BSL
43.

Definition. (See Appendix I; Attachment III in IMF Country Report No. 06/183).

44.
Adjustment clauses. The ceiling on the NDA of the BSL will be adjusted upward by
fifty percent of the amount of the shortfall in the external budgetary assistance at the test
dates. The ceiling will be adjusted downward by the amount of the excess in the external
budgetary assistance at the test dates.
C. Net Domestic Bank Credit to the Central Government (NCG)
45.

Definition. (See Appendix I; Attachment III in IMF Country Report No. 06/183).

46.
Adjustment clauses. The ceiling on the increase in NCG will be adjusted upward by
up to fifty percent of the amount of the shortfall in external budgetary assistance and in case
of delays of debt relief under MDRI. The ceiling will be adjusted downward by the amount
of the excess in external budgetary assistance. The leone value of the cumulative shortfall or
excess in external budgetary assistance will be converted at the program exchange rates. The
ceiling will also be adjusted downward (upward) by the excess (shortfall) in the leone value
of net issues of government securities to the nonbank private sector vis-à-vis the program
target (specified in the memorandum items in Table 3 of the MEFP).
47.
Data source. The data source for the above will be the series “Claims on Government
(Net)” submitted to Fund staff and reconciled with the monthly monetary survey prepared by
the BSL. These data will be reconciled with monthly reports with the monetary data
(Treasury bill transactions, ways-and-means account, and Treasury bearer bond transactions).

18

External budgetary assistance is defined as program grants and program loans, but excluding
external financing for the Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration (DDR) Program, and

STRUCTURAL PERFORMANCE CRITERIA

A. Modernization Plan of the National Revenue Authority (NRA)
56.
The three-year modernization plan of the NRA will aim at streamlining the NRA,
including a separation of headquarters and operations functions. The cabinet will adopt the
plan and table it before parliament by the test date.

For this structural performance criterion, fiscal data should be collected and
reconciled with the expanded monetary data produced by the BSL to ensure consistency of
the fiscal and monetary databases.
V. PROGRAM MONITORING
59.
The Sierra Leonean authorities shall maintain a program-monitoring committee
composed of senior officials from the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economic
Development and Planning; the Bank of Sierra Leone, and other relevant agencies. The
committee shall be responsible for monitoring the performance of the program,
recommending policy responses, informing the Fund regularly about the progress of the
program, and transmitting the supporting materials necessary for the evaluation of
performance criteria and benchmarks. In addition, the Net Domestic Financing (NDF)
Technical Committee shall provide the Fund with weekly minutes of its meetings
complemented with the minutes of the monthly meetings of the Inter-Agency Committee for
National Statistics progress report on the program on a monthly basis within four weeks of
the end of each month, using the latest available data.

57

Implementation of the Revised Guidelines on Performance
Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt
The term “debt” has the meaning set forth in point No. 9 of the Guidelines
on Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt adopted on
August 24, 2000 which reads as follows: “(a) For the purpose of this
guideline, the term “debt” will be understood to mean a current, i.e., not
contingent, liability, created under a contractual arrangement through the
provision of value in the form of assets (including currency) or services, and
which requires the obligor to make one or more payments in the form of
assets (including currency) or services, at some future point(s) in time; these
payments will discharge the principal and/or interest liabilities incurred
under the contract. Debts can take a number of forms, the primary ones
being as follows: (i) loans, i.e., advances of money to obligor by the lender
made on the basis of an undertaking that the obligor will repay the funds in
the future (including deposits, bonds, debentures, commercial loans and
buyers’ credits) and temporary exchanges of assets that are equivalent to
fully collateralized loans under which the obligor is required to repay the
funds, and usually pay interest, by repurchasing the collateral from the
buyer in the future (such as repurchase agreements and official swap
arrangements); (ii) suppliers’ credits, i.e., contracts where the supplier
permits the obligor to defer payments until some time after the date on
which the goods are delivered or services are provided; and (iii) leases, i.e.,
arrangements under which property is provided which the lessee has the
right to use for one or more specified period(s) of time that are usually
shorter than the total expected service life of the property, while the lessor
retains the title to the property. For the purpose of the guideline, the debt is
the present value (at the inception of the lease) of all lease payments
expected to be made during the period of the agreement excluding those
payments that cover the operation, repair or maintenance of the property.
(b) Under the definition of debt set out in point 9(a) above, arrears,
penalties, and judicially awarded damages arising from the failure to make
payment under a contractual obligation that constitutes debt are debt.
Failure to make payment on an obligation that is not considered debt under
this definition (e.g., payment on delivery) will not give rise to debt”].
(B) Excluded from this performance criterion are normal import-related
credits, disbursements from the IMF, and those debts subject to
rescheduling arrangements.

VIII. Safeguards Assessment
Under the IMF safeguards assessment policy, the Bank of Sierra Leone was subject to a
safeguards assessment with respect to the PRGF arrangement approved on May 10, 2006.
The assessment, which was completed on June 12, 2006, proposed recommendations to
address new and continuing vulnerabilities in the financial reporting, internal audit, and
internal controls areas. The implementation of these measures is being monitored by IMF
staff.
IX.

Exchange Rate Arrangement and Summary of Exchange Restrictions

The BSL calculates an official exchange rate every Friday morning as the weighted average
of the auction rate, the commercial banks’ mid-rate and the bureaus’ mid-rate in the previous
week, for customs valuation purposes and for official transactions. Commercial banks may
buy and sell foreign exchange from/to individual customers, as well as trade among
themselves or with the BSL on a freely negotiable basis. As of October 31, 2006, the BSL
mid-rate was Le 2986.9=US$1. The exchange rate regime has been reclassified as “crawling
peg” to reflect the nominal stability of exchange rate developments under de facto
management by the BSL through the auction as the only seller of foreign exchanges.
With effect from December 14, 1995, Sierra Leone has accepted the obligations of
Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4. On June 29, 2001, Sierra Leone removed the remaining
19

Net present value (NPV) terms at the decision point under the enhanced framework.

maintain an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for
current international transactions.

Appendix III. Sierra Leone: World Bank–IMF Relations
(As of September 30, 2006)
A.

Partnership in Sierra Leone’s development strategy

1.
Sierra Leone’s development strategy increasingly emphasizes growth and poverty
reduction. Its final PRSP (adopted by the government in March 2005) highlights growth as a
precondition for poverty reduction, and comprises three pillars: (i) Good governance,
Security, and Peace Building; (ii) Pro-poor Sustainable Growth for Food Security and Job
Creation; and (iii) Human Development.
2.
The IMF and World Bank staffs maintain a collaborative relationship in supporting
the government’s macroeconomic and structural reforms, in line with the guidelines for
enhanced Bank-Fund collaboration. This includes regular participation of Bank staff in the
meetings with the government on the Fund’s program review missions, IMF staff
participation in Bank development policy missions, and Bank internal review meetings. The
IMF takes the lead in macroeconomic stabilization and the World Bank in social and
structural areas, with close collaboration on a few structural areas that have a particular
impact on macroeconomic stability. The Fund’s dialogue and conditionality are consistent
with the structural programs agreed with the Bank, and the Bank’s dialogue and
conditionality have maintained consistency with the macroeconomic framework endorsed by
the Fund.
B.

World Bank Group strategy

3.
The Bank’s Board endorsed a new IDA Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Sierra
Leone for FY2006–09 in June 2005 following continued progress in establishing security and
governance as well as the completion of the new PRSP. The new CAS supports the strategy
outlined in the PRSP for a transition to policies and programs for sustained growth and
poverty reduction with gradually decreasing emphasis on post-conflict needs. The continued
maintenance of a stable macroeconomic framework is considered to be a prerequisite for
World Bank program support.
4.
Under the CAS, the World Bank, through IDA, is assisting the government in
pursuing progress under three strategic priorities: (i) Governance, Decentralization, and
Public Financial Management; (ii) Sustainable Growth, Food Security and Jobs Creation; and
(iii) Human Development. Instruments used in supporting these objectives include a series of
Development Policy Grants followed by a series of PRSC operations, a US$44 million
transportation project, a US$23 million rural and private sector development project, a
US$6 million Mining Sector Management operation, and further social sector, infrastructure,
and public sector reform operations in the outer years.

65

5.
Thus, in FY2006, the Bank provided a US$44 million credit for an Infrastructure
Development Project (Transport). In FY2007, planned operations include a Rural
Development and Private Sector Development Project (US$23 million), a Mineral Resources
Technical Assistance Project (US$6 million), and a Development Policy Grant
(US$10 million). In FY2008, the Bank expects to provide another Development Policy Grant
and a social sector credit (education and health).
6.
As of July 14, 2006, the World Bank has approved 51 loans, credits and grants for a
total of US$833.9 million, with an undisbursed amount of US$179.2 million. The current
portfolio consists of eight operations, as summarized in the table below, in the areas of
infrastructure, decentralization, and government services totaling about US$206.5 million.

IMF-World Bank collaboration

7.
Areas in which the Fund leads. The Fund takes the lead in macroeconomic
stabilization including macro-fiscal policy, monetary policy, exchange rate policy, and
financial stability and risk management.
8.
Areas in which the Bank leads. The Bank takes the lead in structural areas where
both institutions have conditionality, including structural reform, privatization, and

66

regulatory reform (telecommunications, banking, financial and energy sectors). The Bank
also leads in other areas such as: agricultural competitiveness/diversification; rural
development (irrigation, roads, support to producer organizations); private sector
development (strengthening the investment climate, access to business services, support to
small/medium enterprises); urban development (historic rehabilitation/preservation,
land/housing market development, water/road infrastructure); transportation
policy/infrastructure; energy sector reforms; and social sectors (health, education and social
protection, including HIV/AIDS). The Bank’s work in structural areas includes analytical
work and dialogue on trade and growth policies, which form part of the overall economic
policy dialogue.
9.
Areas of shared responsibility. Both Bank and Fund collaborate in assessing
performance of HIPC resource use. Both also monitor progress on budgetary and public
expenditure management, yet emphasize different aspects of the government’s reform
program in their respective support operations. Bank support is at the national level in the
Ministry of Finance (global MTEF, integrated information technology system, audit
capabilities, budget reporting) and sector ministries (selected sector MTEFs, inter- and intrasectoral allocations), as well as at the local councils’ level. The Fund’s emphasis is on fiscal
management, expenditure management, and revenue enhancing measures.

67

Appendix IV. Sierra Leone: Statistical Issues
1.
The prolonged civil war has resulted in serious deficiencies in the macroeconomic
database, particularly in the areas of the balance of payments, national accounts, and social
indicators. From the May 1997 coup to March 1998, statistical compilation virtually collapsed
because of institutional damage and the departure of key skilled personnel from the
administration. Since April 1998, however, the authorities have endeavored to rehabilitate the
data collection and compilation systems. The authorities are cooperating fully in providing data
to the Fund for the purposes of policy formulation and program monitoring. The authorities are
also trying to disseminate economic and financial data to the public on a regular basis.
2.
A major and sustained improvement in the coverage and timeliness of economic data
will require the restructuring of the institutional framework following recommendations of the
March 2004 IMF/World Bank mission on the development of a strategic plan for the statistical
system. Budgetary resources remain scarce for the main statistical unit, Statistics Sierra Leone
(SSL); this situation most adversely affects the compilation of national accounts and price
statistics. Cooperation and coordination between the main statistical agencies should also be
improved. Sierra Leone participates in the GDDS and its metadata, including detailed plans for
improvement over the short and medium term, were posted on the Fund’s DSBB on
May 29, 2003, and subsequently updated in August 2006. Sierra Leone is receiving Fund
technical assistance (TA) in priority areas under the regional GDDS project for Anglophone
African countries, funded by the U.K. Department for International Development (DfID).
National accounts
3.
National accounts data are prepared by the SSL using data received from government
ministries and agencies, public enterprises, and through small annual sample surveys of
economic activity, although based on outdated lists and with extremely low response rates.
Thus, the private sector has not been adequately represented in the national accounts
compilations, especially small businesses, which represent a very high proportion of business
activity in Sierra Leone. The consumer price index (CPI) is used extensively to derive estimates
of GDP at constant prices.
4.
Following the civil war, an effort to reconstruct the national accounts estimates
commenced during 2003/04 and is continuing, with the main effort now focusing on preparing
new estimates for 2001 and beyond. Resource constraints have significantly delayed production
of final estimates and only preliminary data for the 2001–04 period have been made available.
These are now in the final stages of revision, but will be relatively weak because of the lack of
adequate source data, especially for 2001 and 2002.

68

5.
Since March 2004, and with support from the GDDS Anglophone Africa Project, five
national accounts TA missions visited Freetown, the last being in January 2006. These missions
reviewed the source data, methodologies, and compilation issues and assisted with data
development and improvements in methodology. The last mission prepared and coordinated
with the authorities a short-term action plan to incorporate longer-term improvements in the
strategic plan. Plans are underway to prepare revised national accounts based on a 2005
benchmark and using 2005 prices to compile constant price estimates. However, shortages of
resources and staff continue to pose major constraints to statistical development undertaken by
SSL.
6.
Fund area department missions continue to make their own estimates and projections of
key national accounts aggregates, as well as adjustments to historical data using available
information.
Prices
7.
The CPI is compiled on a monthly basis by the SSL and published with a lag of about
three weeks. It covers the capital city and three towns with a base period of 1992. Plans are
underway to re-base the CPI to 2004; using the 2003 Sierra Leone integrated household survey
and extended the geographic coverage of the CPI so that a national CPI can be compiled. SSL
plans to complete this work during 2006 following the end of the field work in June 2006. The
production of producer price indices remains a medium-term goal.
Government finance statistics
8.
The budget reporting system was established with assistance provided under the
Fund/UNDP technical assistance project. Monthly data on central government revenue, current
expenditure, and financing are provided, with appropriate desegregation. The European
Commission (EC) is providing technical assistance to the Accountant General’s Office that will
improve the timeliness and quality of fiscal data. Data on capital expenditure are poor. Sierra
Leone reports fiscal data to AFR and has resumed its submission of annual data for publication
in the GFS Yearbook (data for 2002 through 2004 will be published in the 2006 GFSY). Fiscal
data only cover the budgetary central government, excluding extrabudgetary agencies and local
governments.
9.
There is an urgent need for greater timeliness and accuracy of data on foreign-financed
development projects. Reports on the implementation of the development budget and its
financing are currently not produced in a format that is suitable for budget analysis as
implementation data are not available. There is also need for assuring quality control of the
final data. The authorities are currently considering the introduction of a flash reporting system
for government expenditure in general- and foreign aid-financed projects. In the context of the

69

GDDS regional project for Anglophone African countries, work has been undertaken to
reconcile fiscal and monetary data, and to improve the coverage and classification of these two
data sets (see below). This reconciliation is a performance criterion in Sierra Leone’s PRGF
program with the Fund.
Monetary statistics
10.
The main components of the central bank balance sheet are available on a daily and
weekly basis; this system provides an early warning system on key financial targets. The full
monetary survey is compiled by the Bank of Sierra Leone (BSL) with a lag of about six weeks,
with comprehensive coverage of commercial banks.
11.
A key issue remains the reconciliation of fiscal and monetary statistics. An October
2004 TA mission indicated that such reconciliation is very difficult due in part to (i) fiscal data
compilation solely on a cash basis, and (ii) incomplete definition of the central government.
Even though the authorities undertook an exercise in 2003 to identify government accounts in
the banking system, the review of the list of government agencies revealed significant
shortcomings. The mission recommended that the authorities develop a reliable definition of the
central government for statistical purposes. Three follow-up missions were conducted in 2005
to assist the authorities in the identification of all government units, to establish a fiscal
reporting system, to classify the accounts of the BSL according to STA’s Standard Report Form
(SRF), and to provide training for commercial bank officials. A follow-up mission in August
2006 reviewed progress in developing reconciliation between the expanded fiscal data and the
existing monetary data and implementing the SRFs for the BSL and other depository
corporations (ODC). The mission noted that while significant progress was made in
implementing the SRF for the BSL and introducing new forms for reporting ODC data to the
BSL, progress has been slow in establishing a regular fiscal reporting system.
Balance of payments statistics
12.
The BSL is responsible for the compilation of balance of payments (BOP) statistics. The
BSL obtains source data from the SSL, government ministries, the Customs and Excise
Department (Customs), and the “Financial Survey of Major Limited Companies,” for data on
foreign direct investment. Goods estimates are based on the import and export data compiled by
Customs and are adjusted for coverage, valuation, and timing to accord with BOP definitions.
However, the BSL does not make adjustments to BOP data using supplementary information to
take account of unreported data.
13.
External transactions are characterized by a large volume of activity in the informal
sector, principally the smuggling of diamonds. A considerable portion of imports is financed by
these unrecorded exports. As a result, official BOP statistics tend to substantially understate

70

transactions. The staff has been addressing this problem through the use of third-country
(principally EU member) import data. The Fund’s Statistics Department (STA) has been
providing technical assistance on BOP issues under the GDDS project to help the authorities
with the implementation of the Balance of Payments Manual, Fifth Edition (BPM5)—the most
recent technical assistance mission took place in September/October 2004.
14.
Outstanding data problems exist for trade in services, income statistics, current
transfers, and in the financial and capital accounts. Regarding the latter, there are substantial
difficulties in tracking financial transactions of the public and private sectors that are routed
through commercial banks. While the authorities are producing data on international investment
position, improvements are required in coverage and in valuation adjustments. These
difficulties are manifested in reconciling flow data in the BOP and stocks in the international
investment position. Estimates of smuggled imports and exports, in particular diamonds, are
also not available.
15.
Against this background, information on official program grant and loan receipts is
relatively good and is prepared by AFR on the basis of contact with the authorities and donor
agencies. In contrast, data on private capital flows are very poor. Some information on private
banking flows can be derived from the monetary survey. Other private capital flows, especially
those linked to the informal diamond trade, are implicitly included within “Errors and
omissions.” Data on the gross and net official reserves positions of the BSL are provided
monthly to the Fund with a short lag. STA is in contact with the authorities in an effort to
reconcile balance of payments flow data with stock data in the international investment
position.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
February 13, 2007

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation with
Sierra Leone
On December 15, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Sierra Leone.1
Background
Sierra Leone has made substantial progress with its post-conflict transition.
Macroeconomic performance during the last Poverty Reduction and Growth Facilitysupported program (2001-04) was on the whole strong, and structural reforms helped
establish a foundation for improved public finance management and the conduct of
macroeconomic policies. Overall performance continued to improve during 2005, with
output growth estimated at 7.3 percent, reflecting healthy activity in agriculture, mining,
construction, and the services sectors. In 2005, annual average inflation declined
moderately to 12.1 percent as the fiscal stance was tightened during the last quarter of
2005.
However, this tightening did not fully produce the hoped-for results and the overall fiscal
position deteriorated because revenues were lower and poverty-related spending and
development expenditures accelerated. Significant inflows of foreign aid led to the
accumulation of net foreign assets and accelerated the pace of monetary expansion.
The external current account deficit (including official transfers) widened to 7.7 percent
of GDP from about 5 percent of GDP in 2004, because import growth outpaced a
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities.

2

diamond-led strong export performance, reflecting higher cost of imported fuels and
capital goods associated with refurbishing the mines. After depreciating steadily during
the past few years, the real effective exchange rate of the leone appreciated by about
21 percent in 2005.
In the context of the new PRGF-supported program (2006-08), the government took
corrective measures and policies against the fiscal and monetary slippages. During the
first half of 2006, inflation fell to 9.3 percent at end-June 2006, as a continued tight fiscal
stance, supported by adequate monetary policy, mitigated pressures stemming from the
pass-through of high world oil prices. Revenue performance and external budgetary
support were strong and, coupled with lower-than-budgeted expenditures, led to a
significant improvement of the liquidity position. This allowed the government to make
net repayments to commercial banks, which in turn contributed to a slowdown in the
growth of net domestic assets of the banking system. Broad and reserve money
expansion fell below the program projections set for June 2006. External gross reserves
reached US$187 million (3.6 months of import coverage) at end-June 2006, reflecting
fully disbursed budgetary support. With inflation declining and the nominal effective
exchange rate fairly stable, the real exchange rate depreciated for most of 2006.
Regarding structural reforms, progress has been made in the area of public financial
management with a numbers of measures implemented in the context of the PRGF
arrangement. These include the adoption of a Government Budgeting and
Accountability law and the introduction of a new Integrated Financial Management
Information System (IFMIS) to facilitate better expenditure control and accounting. On
the other hand, progress has been limited in the area of combating corruption and the
Anti-Corruption Commission needs further strengthening.
Growth prospects over the medium term remain encouraging with the completion of the
rehabilitation of rutile and bauxite mining operations, a projected increase in gold
exports, and a pick up in services growth. Real output growth is projected to stabilize in
the range of 6-7 percent during 2006-10, underpinned by broad-based sectoral growth.
Inflation is expected to converge to single digits by the end of 2007, while the current
account deficit would narrow, aided by growth in mineral exports. The projected strong
and broad-based growth will, however, still leave Sierra Leone quite far in terms of
achieving the MDGs. Poverty remains pervasive, particularly in rural areas, and povertyreducing efforts have yet to make notable progress.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed Sierra Leone’s continued robust and broad-based
economic growth and the recent moderation of inflation, and commended the authorities
for their steady progress in consolidating the environment of peace and stability.
Directors recognized the continued critical role of the international community in helping
Sierra Leone to surmount the daunting post-conflict challenges.
Directors stressed that the realization of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) will
depend on progress towards fiscal sustainability, the avoidance of excessive debt

3

accumulation, and strong private-sector led growth, supported by significant external
financial assistance. They observed that, in order to create fiscal space for poverty
reduction, the authorities will need to increase Sierra Leone’s domestic revenue-to-GDP
ratio and rationalize public expenditure. Directors emphasized, in this context, the
importance of bringing the wage bill under control, including through civil service
reforms.
Directors encouraged the authorities to accelerate governance and other structural
reforms, which will enhance transparency and accountability and improve the regulatory
environment, and commended the authorities’ initiatives to strengthen public financial
management. They cautioned against the use of tax incentives to stimulate activity and
encouraged, instead, the adoption of a rules-based and predictable fiscal regime that
will apply uniformly to all companies. In light of the public perception of widespread
corruption, Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to implement reforms in
several critical areas in the context of the Improved Governance and Accountability
Pact, and to ensure the full implementation of the Extractive Industries Transparency
Initiative.
Directors encouraged the authorities to address financial sector reforms to foster
domestic savings and spur investment and growth. In this connection, they urged the
authorities to set up a timetable for adopting and implementing a comprehensive
strategy to reform the financial system drawing on the recommendations of the 2006
Financial Sector Assessment Program, and carry through with the implementation of the
Anti-Money Laundering Act.
Directors stressed that vigilance will be needed to ensure the containment of inflation
and welcomed the decision to provide government securities to the Bank of Sierra
Leone (BSL), which will help strengthen the monetary framework. They also stressed
that more flexible exchange rates would facilitate economic adjustment to exogenous
shocks, and recommended that interventions by the Bank of Sierra Leone in the foreign
exchange market be limited to achieving targeted international reserves and smoothing
excessive short-term volatility. A few emphasized that increased flexibility would need to
be phased in as the supporting infrastructure and administration are strengthened.
Directors observed that following the provision of debt relief under the enhanced HIPC
Initiative and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), Sierra Leone’s debt ratio will
decline significantly, lowering the risk of debt distress and providing much-needed
resources for reducing poverty and meeting the MDGs. They welcomed the authorities’
commitment to use freed up resources for poverty-reducing spending and their intention
to rely on grants and limit new borrowing to highly concessional loans in order to avoid
an unsustainable accumulation of debt. Directors encouraged non-Paris Club creditors
to grant debt relief in line with the HIPC framework, and emphasized the need for a
close monitoring of external and domestic debt in the post-MDRI era. Looking forward,
they underscored the importance of the international community’s continued support for
the authorities’ reform efforts.

4

Directors expressed concern at continued data weaknesses and underscored the need
to improve, in particular, the timeliness and quality of national accounts and financial
data. They urged the authorities to provide adequate resources to Statistics Sierra
Leone in this endeavor.

IMF Executive Board Completes First Review Under
PRGF Arrangement for Sierra Leone and Approves US$6.6 Million Disbursement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has completed the first review of
Sierra Leone's performance under an SDR 31.1 million (about US$46.7 million) Poverty
Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement (see Press Release 06/94). With the
completion of this review, Sierra Leone would be able to draw the equivalent of SDR 4.4 million
(about US$6.6 million), bringing the amount disbursed under the arrangement to the equivalent
of SDR 9.1 million (about US$13.7 million).
The Board agreed to waive the nonobservance of the end-June 2006 structural performance
criterion on the updating and auditing of the civil service database, as this measure has been
implemented as a prior action for completion of the first review.
Following the Executive Board's discussion on Sierra Leone, Mr. Murilo Portugal, Deputy
Managing Director and Acting Chairman, said:
“The Sierra Leonean authorities are to be commended for their progress in consolidating peace
and macroeconomic stability, which has supported continued robust and broad-based growth and
a recent moderation in inflation. This progress places Sierra Leone, with the assistance of the
international community, including the United Nations Peacebuilding Commission, in a
favorable position to surmount its daunting post-conflict challenges.
“The realization of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) will depend on strengthened
program performance, including progress towards fiscal sustainability, the avoidance of
excessive debt accumulation, and strong private-sector led growth, supported by significant
external financial assistance. In order to create fiscal space for poverty reduction, the Sierra
Leonean authorities will need to increase the domestic revenue-to-GDP ratio, and rationalize
public expenditure. A key policy measure will be civil service reforms, which should improve
the quality of public services while also helping to bring the wage bill under control.

2

“Financial sector reforms will be important for fostering domestic savings and spurring
investment and growth. Implementation of a comprehensive strategy to strengthen the financial
system according to a firm timetable will be a crucial element of the reforms. A further important
element will be sustained implementation of the Anti-Money Laundering Act.
“Vigilance will be needed to ensure the containment of inflation. In this regard, the decision to
provide government securities to the Bank of Sierra Leone (BSL), which will help strengthen the
monetary framework, is welcome. The authorities appropriately aim to pursue a flexible
exchange rate policy which will facilitate economic adjustment to exogenous shocks.
“The acceleration of governance and other structural reforms will enhance transparency and
accountability, and improve the regulatory framework. The authorities’ commitment to critical
reforms in the context of the Improved Governance and Accountability Pact, and to the full
implementation of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative is welcome.
“The provision of debt relief under the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC)
Initiative and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) will lead to a significant decline in
Sierra Leone’s debt ratio, lowering the risk of debt distress. The authorities’ commitment to
using freed up resources for poverty-reducing spending and their intention to borrow only on
highly concessional terms are commendable. Non-Paris Club creditors are encouraged to grant
debt relief in line with the HIPC framework,” Mr. Portugal said.

Statement by Peter Gakunu, Executive Director for Sierra Leone
and Joseph T. Kanu, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
December 15, 2006
Introduction
1.
On behalf of our Sierra Leonean authorities, we thank staff, Management and the
Executive Board for the continued support provided to Sierra Leone, including technical
assistance, throughout the past years. They recognize the hard work and fruitful dialogue that
has taken place between them, the IMF and the World Bank in the preparation of the current
PRGF and HIPC Initiative Completion Point documents. These developments are an
important achievement and also serve as evidence of the effective engagement of the
international community in Sierra Leone. The authorities recognize the many challenges
going forward into the medium-term, and count on the continued engagement of the
international community to address them. In particular, expanding and improving social and
economic infrastructure remains fundamental in the fight against poverty, given that the lack
of these fundamentals has constituted an important impediment to growth and severely
eroded the quality of life of the citizenry.
Recent Economic Developments
2.
While much progress has been made in the implementation of the successor PRGF
arrangement, approval of the completion point under the enhanced HIPC Initiative will
strengthen the authorities’ resolve. The authorities remain committed to sound
macroeconomic management of the economy, promoting sustainable growth, and working
towards reducing the pervasive poverty. Economic growth in the first half of 2006 was
robust, supported by strengthened fiscal performance. This also resulted in improvements in
the country’s liquidity position, which has further led to net repayments to the central bank.
This positive development led to a considerable reduction in the growth of net domestic
assets of the banking system. However, developments in net foreign assets dominated growth
in broad money during the period 2005-2006. Considerable foreign aid inflows greatly
supported growth in credit to both government and the private sector. On the other hand,
broad money growth declined to levels below program targets in 2006 due to continuous
policy adjustment, namely an increase in government deposits and partial sterilization of
domestic liquidity by the central bank in the foreign exchange auction.
3.
Resumption of exports in rutile and bauxite led to an improvement in the external
current account despite a deterioration in 2005 caused by higher import prices of oil
products. Gross foreign reserves rose to about 3.6 months of import cover supported by the
gradual reduction of refurbishing-related exports. Reforms were also undertaken to
strengthen governance, particularly in public financial management, in order to develop the
capacity of the public sector, supported by the donor community. This has resulted in

2

improvements in budget preparation, budget execution, and public procurement. Efforts have
also been made to limit the level of central bank financing of the budget deficits, control
public expenditures, and improve service delivery through more frequent and focused public
expenditure tracking surveys (PETS).
Surveillance
4.
Given the high reliance on external assistance, a key challenge for the authorities’
going forward is to ensure that higher economic growth and rapid progress toward achieving
the MDGs are sustained. In addition to making adequate use of the available mineral
potential, the agricultural sector will be developed, as outlined in the SL-PRSP pillars, which
include ensuring the consolidation of peace and macroeconomic stability; and fostering an
enabling environment to promote private sector activities. The authorities continue their
strive to mobilizing additional domestic resources and directing these resources towards
meeting the objectives of poverty reduction and growth. In order to attract needed FDI, the
authorities are providing tax incentives in a transparent manner and in the context of the
private sector development program currently under implementation with assistance from
DfID, UK. Efforts are also being made to implement a comprehensive strategy in order to
streamline the regulatory environment and strengthen property rights. In view of this, the
Bankruptcy Act is being revisited; the Securities Act is under preparation; while a new
Companies Act is in the process of being introduced.
5.
Implementation of a crawling peg exchange rate in 2005 resulted in a sharp
appreciation of the exchange rate, which led to a reversal of gains in competitiveness from
the previous depreciation. In view of high vulnerability to external shocks and the benefits
that will arise from pursuing a more flexible exchange rate policy, the central bank’s ongoing
activities have ensured limited interventions in order to achieve program objectives on
international reserves. The authorities reiterate that they currently have no target exchange
rate path and are, therefore, not supportive of a reclassification of the de facto exchange rate
regime as a crawling peg, given that the exchange rate has been stable over extended periods.
Fiscal Policy
6.
Preservation of fiscal sustainability largely depends on prudent and better
mobilization of domestic revenues, which will facilitate meeting the huge poverty reduction
expenditures and improvement in infrastructures needed to support growth. The low rate of
tax compliance has enabled efforts to strengthen the National Revenue Authority (NRA) and
current policy priorities in this regard include undertaking reforms in broadening the tax base
and eliminating tax exemptions consistent with the recommendations of the IMF study. Other
measures include creating the large taxpayers unit (LTU), intensifying collection of tax
arrears, and adopting an integrated approach for the computerization of tax procedures.
Additional efforts are on-going to revise bilateral agreements with private sector entities to

3

ensure maximization of government revenue, including equal treatment of potential
investors, and eliminating discretionary tax and duty waivers.
7.
On expenditures, the authorities realize the enormous benefits that will arise from
controlling the wage bill and ensuring improvements in the level of expenditures. Their main
objective is to develop and implement a credible wage management system in certain key
ministries given the challenges faced, especially in the management of a post conflict wage
bill, as Ministries have had a compelling need to reinstate displaced civil servants as they
showed up. Accelerated reconstruction of education and security sectors have also led to
increased recruitment of teachers and police personnel respectively, leading to a rising wage
bill. Measures are, however, being taken to sunset these activities to avoid recurrent wage
bill overruns. In this respect, the authorities have, with the assistance of donor partners,
undertaken to create a Senior Executive Service (SES) aimed at generating a competent
leadership for all Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs).
8.
The authorities believe that obtaining debt relief under the HIPC and MDRI will
facilitate a sustainable public external debt burden over the medium-term. They are
committed to continued implementation of sound macroeconomic policies that would include
pursuit of a prudent external financing strategy. The authorities will also undertake a prudent
borrowing policy and ensure strengthening of debt management capacity in order to
eliminate any build up of unsustainable debt. In this regard, they are committed to accessing
more grant financing and concessional loans from their development partners, in addition to
ensuring tighter controls on expenditures to prevent the emergence of domestic arrears.
Transparency and Accountability
9.
The authorities are aware that enhanced transparency and accountability will help
prevent misappropriation and waste of public resources, a key factor in stimulating economic
development and reducing poverty. They are implementing the Institutional Governance and
Accountability Pact (IGAP) agreed with donors. They are committed to undertaking and
completing critical governance and accountability reforms by mid 2007. There are ongoing
efforts to strengthen the Anti Corruption Commission (ACC), including the establishment of
a Law Reform Task Force to review and amend the ACC Act of 2000. While continuing to
strengthen public financial management, the authorities have also introduced the new
Integrated Financial and Management Information System (IFMIS) to facilitate expenditure
control and accounting. The IFMIS will be rolled-out to key MDAs in the first half of 2007,
and will be extended to all other government institutions and local councils at a later stage.
Financial Sector Reform
10.
Developing the financial sector remains a key priority for the authorities, with
expectations that this will help promote savings and generate investment growth. To buttress

4

their commitment, the authorities intend to adopt a comprehensive financial sector strategy in
the last quarter of 2007 in line with FSAP recommendations. This will, in addition to other
measures, address vulnerabilities, especially on issues relating to undercapitalization and
credit quality of the commercial banks. Financial intermediation will also facilitate
restoration of confidence within the banking system that includes ensuring efficiency in the
payments and settlements system. The administrative and regulatory structures will also be
set up to kick start stock market activities within the economy. Finally, in addition to the
ratification of the United Nations Convention for the Suppressing of Financing of Terrorism,
the Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Act will be implemented, and with technical assistance,
the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) will be created to boost efforts towards combating
AML and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (CFT).
PRGF Program Implementation
11.
Implementation of the current PRGF program has been satisfactory with all
quantitative performance criteria met with the exception of the structural performance
criteria and benchmark. The authorities reiterate their position that delays in implementation
of the above measures was due to existing constraints on capacity. Going forward, the
authorities have completed the audit of the civil service database and are devising an action
plan to address identified weaknesses. A plan has already been adopted to reduce the number
of tax exemptions, resulting in the structural performance for end-September 2006 being
observed. Given their renewed commitment towards achieving the targets for the second half
of the year, they continue to emphasize that full financing of the program largely depends on
the timely disbursement of donor resources. Although increases in expenditure will raise the
fiscal deficit, prompt delivery of donor assistance will help bring down inflation and sustain
it at single digit levels. The increase in the level of exports will also result in a substantial
reduction in the current account deficit. The authorities are fully aware of the major
downside risks that may arise to the above developments especially if there is a sluggish
disbursement of resources. They therefore call on the donor community to ensure timely
release of budgetary support.
Medium-Term Outlook
12.
Going forward into the medium-term, real GDP growth is expected to remain at
6.5 percent over the period 2007-09 as a result of robust developments in agriculture and
mining. The macroeconomic framework anticipates an increase in the primary fiscal deficit
to 2.7 percent of GDP to facilitate an increase in poverty-related expenditures under the
HIPC and MDRI. Although there is a possibility for the overall deficit to increase to
12.2 percent of GDP in the event of a shortfall in external budgetary support, this will be
offset by the significant level of increase in private savings. This will eventually culminate in
the external current account remaining unchanged in comparative terms. As regards fiscal
policy, efforts will be directed at the mobilization of domestic revenue to attain the level of

5

13.2 percent of GDP, an increase of 0.7 percent, and to ensure targeting of capital
expenditures and increase them to 8.6 percent by 2007. The authorities will ensure that
poverty-related expenditures are also consistent with the World Bank’s policy focus.
13.
Monetary policy on the other hand, is geared towards ensuring that program
objectives are achieved and allowing modest increases in credit to the private sector. Efforts
will be made to achieve single digit inflation that will be consistent with overall growth in
the economy. Reserve money will continue to serve as the primary intermediate policy target
and will be enhanced by provision of additional government securities to the central bank.
The central bank will maintain its prudent management of monetary aggregates and
involvement in the foreign exchange market will be limited. Steps will also be taken to
increase the efficiency and diversity of monetary policy instruments, including promoting
growth of credit to productive activities. Projected inflows from debt relief will be sterilized
and interventions in the foreign exchange market are to be limited to a weekly basis in order
to meet reserve program targets.
14.
The authorities expect to stabilize the external position by 2007 subject to the
availability of adequate financing. In this regard, requests for debt relief from Paris Club
creditors in relation to HIPC completion point following completion of the first review of the
PRGF program will be undertaken on a timely basis. The authorities have requested an IDA
debt reduction facility to address the remaining commercial debts. Meanwhile, negotiations
continue with commercial creditors and goodwill payments made to avoid litigation. The
authorities stress that a key determinant for the successful implementation of their mediumterm program will be donors’ timely disbursement of committed funds and prompt delivery
of promised technical assistance.
15.
Key challenges of the structural reform program will be addressed commencing 2007,
while those in the financial sector are to be guided by recommendations outlined in the FSAP
report. In this regard, adequate measures have been taken by the authorities through an MOU
between the Ministry of Finance and Bank of Sierra Leone to address shortages in Treasury
bills in the central bank portfolio. This will provide additional monetary instruments in
mopping excess liquidity. Following completion of the safeguards assessment in the first half
of 2006, the central bank will seek to strengthen its supervisory capacity, ensure its financial
viability and strengthen its administrative and financial autonomy. Procedures have been
implemented to restore compliance with the central bank Act through provision of securities
to ensure meeting the minimum paid-up capital. Other measures to be implemented include
guaranteeing the production of reliable data for program monitoring, such as the revision of
procedures in the production of monetary statistics and the automation of such processes.
Recapitalization of the central bank is being achieved primarily through the securitization of
the bank’s longstanding claims on the Treasury.

16.
The authorities recognize the program risks which relate to the difficulty in enforcing
fiscal discipline. Adequate political assurances have been offered in this regard, with
indications that execution of the 2007 budget will not be affected by the forthcoming general
elections. The creation of the Multi-Donor Budget Support (MDBS) has also lent credence to
this assertion, given that both donors and the authorities are in agreement for streamlining
and harmonizing program conditionality, and monitoring and evaluation systems, consistent
with the PRSP framework. The authorities and the participating donors have successfully
completed the first joint review of performance under the MDBS, based on an agreed number
of public financial management benchmarks.
Conclusion
17.
Sierra Leone’s performance in meeting the conditions for reaching the completion
point under the enhanced HIPC Initiative has been broadly satisfactory. The reform agenda
for poverty reduction remains broad and well placed within the macroeconomic framework.
In addition, the track record of performance under the PRGF supported program is also
satisfactory and there has been considerable progress in the implementation of the structural
reform agenda. Governance reforms have been undertaken with particular focus on fighting
corruption, improving public financial management, and decentralization of the public
service delivery system. The authorities are confident that with enhanced HIPC and MDRI
assistance, they will be able to achieve a debt profile below the HIPC threshold, given
assurances from creditors participating in the enhanced HIPC Initiative and MDRI. In this
regard, the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio would be reduced to about 46 percent in 2006.
18.
Considerable momentum has been exhibited by the authorities in program
implementation. They remain cognizant of the benefits that may arise to them in carrying the
program forward, especially after reaching completion point. Corrective action has been
taken on the missed structural performance criteria and prospects for meeting all endDecember targets are favorable. In addition, full implementation of 11 out of the 13
Completion point triggers has been achieved, with those relating to the tracking of
development expenditures and the number of teachers trained for secondary schools being
partially completed. In light of the foregoing, the authorities are requesting waivers for the
missed performance criteria in addition to the nonobservance of the end-June 2006 structural
performance criterion, and completion of the first PRGF review to enable them reach HIPC
completion point.
