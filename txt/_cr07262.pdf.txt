Discussions for the sixth review under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF)
arrangement were held in Maputo during March 14–28, 2007 by a staff team comprising
Messrs. Clément (head), Peiris, Lledó, and Saxegaard (all AFR), and Ms. Kvintradze (PDR).
Mr. Sulemane (OEDAE) also participated in the meetings. The team was assisted by
Mr. Fischer, the Resident Representative in Mozambique, and Ms. Bosten. Messrs. Baxter,
Binkert, Nicholas and Nucifora (all World Bank) joined the discussions. The mission met with
the honorable Prime Minister; and the Ministers of Finance, Education, Health, Transport,
Justice, Mining, Labor, and Trade and Industry; the Governor of the Bank of Mozambique, and
other senior government officials. The mission coordinated its work with a Joint Review of
Program Aid Partners (PAPs), including the World Bank.

•

The government’s successful reform efforts have produced solid growth and price stability.
These efforts have been supported by a PRGF program (2004–07). Building on sustained
macroeconomic stability and recent refinements to the PRGF program, the authorities request a
three-year Policy Support Instrument (PSI) based on the reform agenda articulated in the Plano
de Acção para Redução da Pobreza Absoluta (PRSP II or “PARPA II” in Portuguese) for 2006–
09. Donor support is expected to continue to be significant. Provincial elections are due in late
2007, presidential and assembly elections in 2009.

•

The attached letter of intent (LOI) and memorandum of economic and financial policies (MEFP)
from the Minister of Finance and the Governor of the Bank of Mozambique (Appendix I) reviews
performance on the PRGF arrangement from October 2006 through March 2007, and sets out
policies and program monitoring aspects of the request for a three-year PSI arrangement.
Detailed program monitoring plans for the rest of 2007 are defined in the technical memorandum
of understanding (TMU).

•

The Mozambican authorities appreciated the advice provided by the Executive Board in the
context of the Article IV consultations, including the latest, which was concluded on
April 13, 2005. They agreed that after an impressive performance over the past decade, a “second
wave of reforms” is needed to deepen and accelerate structural changes, in order to sustain high
and broad-based growth. They also found the cooperation and candidness of discussions with
Fund staff very effective. They stressed the importance of continued Fund technical assistance in
buttressing administrative capacity.

•

Mozambique avails itself of the transitional arrangements under Article XIV of the Fund’s
Articles of Agreement. Although it has eliminated all Article XIV exchange restrictions, it
maintains restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international
transactions subject to Fund approval under Article VIII. Mozambique intends to eliminate these
restrictions and accept the obligations of Article VIII, Section 2, 3 and 4.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
•

Sustaining Mozambique’s impressive growth performance is crucial to further
reducing poverty. Now that the postconflict rebound has largely run its course and firstgeneration reforms are completed, a second wave of reforms is needed to sustain broadbased growth and further reduce poverty. Achieving the non-income-related Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs) also requires scaling up basic services without undermining
macroeconomic stability.

•

The current PRGF program helped maintain macroeconomic stability in the face of
exogenous shocks and addressed the structural weaknesses identified in the Ex post
Assessment (IMF/04/53). Performance under the program has improved considerably
since the new government took office in early 2005 after slippages in the run-up to
elections in 2004. All quantitative and structural performance criteria from March 2005
through March 2007 were met except one: base money was above target at end-year 2006
due to a temporary rise in currency demand related to the currency reform. This good
performance has helped the authorities maintain monetary and inflation control and
complete outstanding first-generation reforms identified in the Ex post Assessment.

•

PARPA II (2006–09) recognizes that if growth is to be sustained there must be more
emphasis on productivity growth and a greater role for the private sector. This is to
be achieved by (i) consolidating macroeconomic stability; (ii) reducing the costs of doing
business; and (iii) improving governance and the management of natural resources.

•

The three-year PSI (2007–10) will consolidate macroeconomic stability to sustain
Mozambique’s growth takeoff in the context of scaled-up foreign aid. Fiscal policy
will be reinforced to finance additional priority spending in a sustainable manner and
ensure that a scaling-up of aid-financed expenditures reaches the most productive and
pro-poor sectors. Monetary control will anchor inflationary expectations while a flexible
exchange rate regime will help maintain competitiveness and a comfortable level of
international reserves to cushion against exogenous shocks.

•

The PARPA II also accelerates the implementation of a second wave of reforms to
achieve the MDGs. The structural program aims at improving the business environment
by deepening the financial system and reducing the cost of doing business, as well as
strengthening the fiscal and transparency regime of the natural resource sector.

•

The outlook for 2007 is for continued strong growth, single-digit inflation, and a
sustainable external and fiscal situation. Real GDP growth is expected to decelerate to
its trend of about 7 percent in 2007 after recording 8 ½ percent growth in 2006. The 2007
budget is largely unchanged; it envisages a scaling up of aid-financed expenditures
supported by a continued rise in domestic revenue of 0.5 percent of GDP. The Bank of
Mozambique (BM) will continue to target base money and facilitate absorption of the
additional foreign aid while strengthened public financial management (PFM) systems,
both national and subnational, will ensure that spending is better monitored.

•

Real GDP growth accelerated to about 8 ½ percent in 2006, led by a rebound in
agricultural production after the localized drought of 2005 and by continued activity
in the construction sector (related to megaprojects and donor-financed projects).1

•

Prudent monetary policy helped lower core (nonfood) inflation to single digits in the
second half of 2006, reversing a temporary rise after a spike in petroleum prices.
Headline inflation declined to 4.9 percent in March 2007 after being above target at
the end of year 2006 because of an unexpectedly large seasonal increase in food
prices.

The 2006 currency reform went
smoothly. The BM introduced new
meticais (MT) on July 1, 2006
(1,000 old MTs equal one new one);
about 95 percent of MT in circulation
by the end of March 2007 were new.
Because of volatility in currency
demand around the deadline for
exchanging old currency for new, base
money was above the end-year 2006
target (a performance criterion), though
it fell below by January 2007 and was
within the indicative target for March
2007.

as the BM gradually widened the bands in both the auction and MCI markets, the
spread between the auction rate and rates for bank customers and bureaus fell to preband levels. Transactions in the MCI market also increased as onscreen quotations by
banks were able to move closer to the rate outside the MCI market. The deepening of
the MCI market was supported by a code of conduct among banks and measures to
facilitate firm quotations.

The soundness of Mozambique financial system has continued to improve. Bank
profitability was particularly good in 2006. Nonperforming loans (NPL) have also
fallen to less than 5 percent of all loans according to Mozambican accounting
standards (Table 6). Banks have also become more efficient. In particular, noninterest
expenses to gross income, and to a lesser extent personal expenses to noninterest
expenses, have been declining since 2004. Greater confidence in the banking system
has also led to a significant decrease in liability dollarization and thus less financial
vulnerability. On the other

Microfinance institutions (MFI) have grown significantly in the last decade. Between
2000 and 2005 there was about a five-fold increase in the number of clients and a
seven-fold increase in outstanding loans. Consolidation also seems to be underway: 3
institutions out of about 35 control more than 68 percent of the active loan portfolio.
However, MFI outreach is very limited. Rural areas account for less than 12 percent
of total borrowers. However, growth has been accompanied by a substantial
improvement in performance.

II. POLICY CHALLENGES AND LESSONS FROM THE PRGF-SUPPORTED PROGRAM
2.
Sustaining Mozambique’s impressive growth takeoff is crucial to further
reducing poverty. Since the end of its civil war in 1992, Mozambique has grown 8 percent a
year, on average; it reduced its poverty headcount index from 69 percent in 1997 to
54 percent in 2003. Poverty levels declined more in rural areas than in urban ones, making
Mozambique the second country in the world (other than Vietnam) to see such reductions.
However, now that the postMozambique's growth takeoff continues

3.
The current PRGF program helped maintain macroeconomic stability in the
face of exogenous shocks and addressed structural weaknesses identified in the Ex Post
Assessment (EPA). The request for the program targeted fiscal consolidation in the face of
an expected decline in aid inflows after the aid surge and high inflation (2000–03) related to
the flooding in 2000. Fiscal consolidation limited recourse to monetary financing and helped
reduce inflation to single-digit levels, relieving pressure on domestic interest rates. The
improved structural program performance since March 2005 has also helped the authorities
complete outstanding first-generation reforms identified in the EPA—particularly in
strengthening revenue mobilization by creating a central revenue authority (ATM),
improving expenditure efficiency through the rollout of a government financial management
information system (e-SISTAFE), and addressing vulnerabilities in the financial system.
4.
Performance under the PRGF program was satisfactory in 2006. All quantitative
and structural performance criteria from September 2006 through March 2007 were met
except one: base money was above target at end-year 2006 (MEFP Table 1 and 2). A waiver
for the missed performance criterion is justified as it was temporary and related to the
currency reform. The indicative target on utilization of the Moatize coal mine deposit was
also missed due to higher spending on the construction of a bridge over the Zambezi. Three
out of four structural benchmarks were met for the final review; the benchmark related to the
treasury single account (CUT) has been delayed to the end of September 2007 due to
capacity constraints.
5.
While reiterating the commitment to improving the quality of and access to
public services, the government’s PARPA II (2006–09) recognizes that to sustain
growth, more emphasis must be placed on productivity growth and a greater role for
the private sector. This is to be achieved by:
•

consolidating macroeconomic stability and maintaining competitiveness through
prudent monetary and fiscal policies in the context of a flexible exchange rate regime;

•

improving the investment climate and promoting employment generation by reducing
the cost of doing business; and

•

improving governance and the management of natural resources.

6.
These near- and medium-term challenges are addressed in a three-year PSI
designed to consolidate macroeconomic stability and sustain rapid economic growth.
Given its economic stability, comfortable level of international reserves, policy performance,
and lack of need for balance of payments support, Mozambique is well-placed to graduate to
a PSI when its current PRGF arrangement expires in July 2007. The government favors such
an arrangement to monitor its ambitious reform program and send a signal to donors of its
commitments. The authorities have asked that the PSI proposal be presented to the Executive
Board before the current arrangement expires to avoid a vacuum between the two programs.

13

This approach has been closely coordinated with the World Bank’s new Country Partnership
Strategy (2007–11) and the joint Performance Assessment Framework (PAF) of the
government and donor community.
7.
Recent refinements to the design of the PRGF program should allow for a
smooth transition to a PSI. The streamlining of quantitative performance criteria and
adjusters at the completion of the fourth review seems to have helped focus the quantitative
program, particularly in accommodating both spending and absorption of foreign aid as
needed.2 The replacement of the domestic primary deficit by an asymmetric ceiling on NCG
with regard to external financing and the removal of the indicative target on the wage bill
were particularly useful in reinforcing the management of foreign aid once it became clear
that the decline in aid in 2004–05 would be reversed. Further streamlining of structural
conditionality and strengthening of the interministerial committee monitoring the program
have helped build ownership and allow for regular updating of reform priorities. The
likelihood of a further scaling up of foreign aid and strong program performance over the last
three reviews points to a continuation of the present program design under the proposed PSI.
8.
Close collaboration between the partners and targeted capacity building will
need to continue to facilitate the realization of the reform agenda. The World Bank and
the Fund have worked together very closely on, among other projects, the Poverty Reduction
Support Credit and PRGF program content, the Cahora Bassa hydropower project, and
reform of the fiscal code governing mineral resources. The practice of holding joint BankFund missions has had synergistic benefits and has also reduced the burden on the
government of preparing for multiple missions. The authorities have welcomed the close
coordination between the Bank, the Fund, and the donor community in Maputo. Continuous
Fund technical assistance, provided in close coordination with donors (for example, in the
area of tax reform), has helped build administrative capacity to take the reform process
forward. More recently, PFM reforms, an area where past performance was poor, are
progressing well. These reforms were initiated with substantial Fund technical assistance on
the ground; this has evolved to a more advisory role, and the medium-term PFM reform plan
is being financed by a multidonor common fund. This highlights how intensive and wellcoordinated technical assistance can catalyze progress in the early stages of a major reform
that through time can help build ownership and sustain the reform momentum.

Aid absorption is defined as the extent to which a country’s nonaid current account deficit (in foreign currency
terms) widens in response to an increase in aid inflows.

III. ARTICLE IV POLICY CHALLENGES
9.
The main theme of the Article IV discussions was consolidating macroeconomic
stability and accelerating the second wave of reforms in PARPA II to sustain broadbased growth and further reduce poverty. The mission discussed the results of a
benchmarking exercise comparing the characteristics of fast-growing Asian and sub-Saharan
African (SSA) countries with that of Mozambique to identify potential constraints on rapid
growth. As the exercise shows, Mozambique is well placed to sustain its growth takeoff
given its sound political institutions, geography (coastal and close to South Africa), and
relative equality. On the other hand, regulatory quality and enforcement of the law are
institutional weaknesses that may be detrimental to sustaining Mozambique’s growth takeoff.
Political institutions are relatively sound

The major challenges now are to:

•

Consolidate macroeconomic stability.
Inflation is still higher in
Mozambique than in ASEAN-4
countries and in South Africa, its
main trading partner. To avoid
stymieing growth it must also guard
again real exchange rate
misalignments. The authorities

stability:

¾ Business surveys in 2002 and 2006 found the high cost of credit to be the
most binding constraint to business; more than 70 percent of firms surveyed
said they lacked access to bank loan or overdraft facilities. Access to credit is
a particular problem in the agriculture sector, which is dominated by poor
farmers who lack collateral.

Box 1. Mozambique’s Competitiveness
Although Mozambique’s share of world exports has increased in the past decade, this is due to the
increase in megaproject exports. Excluding megaprojects, its export-to-GDP ratio and its share of world trade
have been relatively stable for the past decade and the contribution of non-megaproject exports to economic
growth has been subdued. Because of the limited linkages between megaprojects and the economy as a whole,
and their susceptibility to swings in commodity prices, there is a need to raise the contribution of nonmegaproject exports. This is particularly true for manufacturing exports, which are often thought to be the
engine of export-led productivity growth.
The real effective exchange rate (REER) has been relatively stable for a decade, although there are signs
that it may currently be somewhat overvalued. Estimates of the fundamental equilibrium exchange rate
(FEER) model for Mozambique suggest that the REER has appreciated in response to improved terms of trade
and productivity and to increases in government consumption, investment, and foreign direct investment, and it
has depreciated in response to increasing openness. Thus, although the evolution of the REER does not indicate
that Mozambique is becoming less competitive, econometric results suggest that the REER may be overvalued
by about 10 percent, though with some statistical uncertainty about the precise magnitude. As a result, export
performance may be weaker than it could have been if the REER had been aligned with its underlying
equilibrium rate.
Diversifying exports into products that are dynamic in the global market place should be part of
Mozambique’s strategy to raise the contribution of the nonmegaproject export sector. Nonmegaproject
exports tend to be concentrated in products that have had below average growth in world markets. This,
together with relatively low price increases, suggests declining demand for these products. Megaproject exports
are concentrated in products for which world demand is increasing, though commodity prices are volatile.
Overall, to help sustain economic growth, there is a need to rebalance export growth toward non-megaproject
exports by diversifying into labor-intensive sectors, in particular manufacturing exports.

In this regard, Botswana and Chile’s experience is more encouraging, although their initial economic

has plagued much of SSA, Mozambique needs (i) an efficient tax and regulatory
regime to attract investment while maximizing benefits to the economy; and (ii) more
transparent management of resource revenue.
IV. THE PSI: ADDRESSING MEDIUM-TERM CHALLENGES 2007–10
A. Medium-Term Outlook
11.
The baseline medium-term macroeconomic framework, which assumes that
macroeconomic stability will be consolidated and the second-wave reforms in PARPA
II accelerated, envisages real GDP growth of about 7–8 percent a year (Table 1).7 This
means persevering with stabilization efforts with the CFMP largely unchanged, particularly a
0.5 percent of GDP annual increase in revenues and moderating current expenditures related
to efficiency gains from the public sector reform program (MEFP ¶¶ 16 and 17). This would
allow private sector credit to expand further while maintaining competitiveness through a
flexible exchange rate regime. Monetary control will target inflation of 5–6 percent. The
impact of recent floods and cyclone has been localized, and should not unduly affect the
near-to-medium term outlook. The external current account deficit will continue to be largely
financed by scaled-up concessional foreign aid; a comfortable level of international reserves
will help cushion against exogenous shocks.
12.
Managing scaled-up aid will be a challenge. Donors have indicated foreign aid may
be scaled up by about US$200 million
Debt remains below the DSA threshold under the alternative scalingup borrowing scenario, although the absorption of the additional
(2 percent of Mozambique’s 2008
foreign aid may require a real exchange rate appreciation
GDP) over the medium term. The
mission therefore discussed an
100
alternative scenario to identify
90
challenges in spending and absorbing
80
70
additional external borrowing. The
60
authorities agreed that unless all
50
spending is on imports (as has not
40
previously been the case), the higher

demand for domestic goods will tend

long-term growth. The mission emphasized that the additional spending must effectively
reach the most economically and socially productive priority sectors (e.g., infrastructure,
education, and health) to elicit a supply response and mitigate any Dutch disease effects.8 The
fiscal framework will also need to rely more on revenue mobilization as an exit strategy from
aid dependence in the long-run and to ensure that at least recurrent spending can be financed
from own resources.
13.
Megaprojects are expected to make a growing contribution to poverty reduction
and fiscal sustainability. Natural resource–based megaprojects can help reduce poverty
indirectly by bringing in more revenue and linking to the economy.9 Beyond the PARPA II
period, strong growth and increased fiscal revenues from megaprojects—such as the
multibillion-dollar Moatize coal mine and the Pande-Temane gas project (still in its cost
recovery phase)—would help Mozambique gradually decrease its dependence on donors.10
14.
The medium-term structural reform agenda is designed to (i) reinforce fiscal
policy to manage scaled-up foreign aid; (ii) refine monetary and exchange rate policy;
(iii) enhance the business environment; and (iv) improve natural resource management
(MEFP ¶17). The proposed PSI, drawn up in close collaboration with the World Bank and
other donors, will support these priorities. The main risks to the medium-term program are
inclement weather, too hasty decentralization, and poor fiscal performance in the run-up to
elections.
B. Strengthening Fiscal Policy and Institutions
15.
Total domestic revenue is envisaged to rise 0.5 percent of GDP by (i) increasing the
number of taxpayers and audits to broaden the tax base; (ii) strengthening border control and
limiting unwarranted customs exemptions; (iii) collecting tax arrears amounting to about
0.3 percent of GDP; (iv) again updating the specific fuel tax rate quarterly and recovering the
real reduction resulting from not indexing in 2005;11 (iv) bringing in more nontax revenues
based on buoyant commodity prices; and (v) continuing to improve tax administration in line
with recent TA from the Fund (MEFP ¶22). Priority public investments will increase
significantly (Table 6). Most of these expenditures will be financed by foreign grants and
8

Although the MDGs have not been fully costed in Mozambique, an accompanying Selected Issues paper
discusses illustrative scaling-up scenarios to identify possible medium- to long-term macroeconomic outcomes,
and measures and policies that would not only help absorb more aid but also ensure that it is used efficiently.

Forward and backward input and output linkages can have an impact from related infrastructure developments
and user fees from their use.

Fiscal revenues from natural resource-based megaprojects could range between 2−3 percent of GDP.

accompanied by sufficient counterpart funds and current spending for maintenance. The
wage bill is unchanged relative to the CFMP; about 10,000 teachers and 3,000 health workers
are to be hired. Transfer payments in 2007 are higher as spending is gradually decentralized,
particularly through an increase in the investment budgets to each districts that began in
2006. If revenue falls short, the authorities have agreed to cut nonpriority expenditures to
meet the NCG target. Overall, scaled up program aid will permit a higher domestic primary
deficit with no recourse to domestic financing, which should bring a healthy increase in
credit to the economy.
16.
The emergency response to the floods along the Zambezi river and Cyclone
Favio is expected to be accommodated within the 2007 budget ceilings, with the
assistance of the international community.12 The government drew up a reconstruction
plan estimated at US$71 million and the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian
Affairs launched an emergency appeal for a further US$29 million to meet short- to mediumterm needs of those affected. The government has asked the donor community to cover most
of the cost of the reconstruction plan. However, if donor financing is inadequate, the
government may consider using the program adjustor to accommodate emergency outlays
(TMU, paragraph 18).
17.
Tax reforms are designed to improve tax system efficiency and achieve the
medium-term revenue targets. A comprehensive review undertaken by Fund TA found the
tax system to be generally sound and appropriate for a low-income country like
Mozambique, but it also identified a few tax policy measures that might compensate for the
further reduction in external tariffs scheduled for 2008 and thus help meet the authorities’
medium-term revenue targets. The government is thinking about including some of these
measures in the 2008 budget (MEFP ¶21). An external audit of VAT refunds outstanding,
including any arrears in payments to large infrastructure contractors, will also be completed
in 2007 to address concerns of stakeholders about delayed payments while maintaining the
integrity of the VAT system.13 The next phase of revenue administration reforms (2007–10)
are designed to establish the ATM as a sustainable, semi-autonomous institution and improve
its operations. The phased integration of the core functions of both tax and customs
administration in 2007 will be supported by putting into operation the strategic plan of the

Maputo can be accommodated within the 2007 budget ceilings.

includes VAT on project supplies.

ATM, drawing up an IT plan to support the ATM, and setting up the tax tribunals (MEFP
¶22).
18.
The implementation of the
medium-term PFM plan (2007–09) will
help maintain macroeconomic stability
by supporting the monitoring of
priority expenditures. A cornerstone of
the PFM plan is the timely
implementation of the e-SISTAFE
Action Plan and Budget (APB) agreed
with the donors and financed through a
multi-donor common fund. Its main
elements are rollout of the budget
execution module to all central and
provincial entities, and its customization
for districts and municipalities;
introduction of Phase II of the budget
formulation module; and the design of
new modules and functions. For 2007
(MEFP ¶23), the milestones are:

•

Development of an integrated and e-SISTAFE–compatible payroll database—registry
of state employees (CAF)—so that the Ministry of Finance can pay salaries via eSISTAFE by the end of June 2007 (structural benchmark).

•

Rollout of e-SISTAFE to all remaining ministries at the central and provincial levels
listed in the TMU by end-December 2007 (structural benchmark).

•

Increase the level of effective direct budget execution (according to the sequence of
commitment, verification, and payment) for goods and services to 30 percent by the
end of September 2007 and 50 percent by the end of December 2007 (structural
assessment criterion); and

•

Pilot test the multicurrency single treasury account (CUT) by the end of September
2007 (structural benchmark) with a goal of full production by January 2008 to facilitate

23

inclusion of all donor-financed projects.14
19.
Reinvigoration of Phase II of the public sector reform program under the
auspices of the new public service authority (ANFP) must be carefully sequenced to
retain accountability and fiscal control. The pillars of the program are (MEFP ¶40):
•

Civil service census. Completion of the census of all civil servants in the second
quarter of 2007 will produce a unique number of total civil servants as the basis for an
integrated payroll database. It should identify “ghost” workers and help control the
wage bill as more frontline sectors recruit teachers, nurses, etc.

•

Wage reform. The government will identify reform options and set a timetable for
improving incentive structures and performance by the end of June 2007; approval of
a new wage policy is expected by the end of 2007, to be implemented in the 2009
budget (MEFP ¶40).

•

Decentralization. The government should be very cautious about devolving resources
to subnational levels through June 2008 until e-SISTAFE is rolled out at the local
level and a decentralization strategy is approved (MEFP ¶40). The strategy should
include, among other things, a clear legal, regulatory, and institutional framework for
the revenue and spending responsibilities of subnational units (provinces, districts,
and municipalities) and monitoring of subnational fiscal operations. This would help
address concerns about the accountability and transparency of district spending.15 The
World Bank will take the lead on capacity-building assistance for local procurement
reform and internal and external audit.

•

Anti-corruption strategy. In 2006 five ministries drew up operational plans; their
implementation will be closely monitored by the National Anti-Corruption Forum
with broad stakeholder participation and leadership from the highest levels (MEFP
¶41). The Central Office for the Fight Against Corruption is also expected to improve
on its performance of 2006 where of 271 cases, 9 were shelved, 4 sent to other
institutions, and only 18 were prosecuted.

14

While a single currency CUT has technical and transparency benefits, this measure can be seen as a transition
measure for donors that are constrained by their own rules. All donors should be encouraged to put their funds
into the CUT as soon as possible, preferably in domestic currency.
15

This is particularly important to avoid politically motivated spending at times of elections.

24

C. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
20.
The monetary program will continue to target base money aimed at keeping
inflation at 5–6 percent (Table 3). Recent trends in monetary aggregates have helped
anchor inflation expectations, keeping the monetary program largely unchanged for 2007.
The impact of the recent flooding on food prices will need to be closely analyzed; no change
in monetary targets is envisaged if core inflation remains subdued.16 The mission supported
the reduction in required bank reserves from 11.5 percent to 10.15 percent of deposits
beginning in April 2007 because it may help reduce the spread between deposit and lending
rates, which is high by regional standards. The BM will need to keep a close watch on the
liquidity impact, however, and mop up any excess liquidity to meet the base money targets.
In general, the BM though it would continue to rely mostly on foreign exchange sales to mop
up structural excess liquidity and absorb foreign aid–financed expenditures, and issue
treasury bills to smooth seasonal liquidity fluctuations.
21.
The BM also recognized that more exchange rate flexibility will support
monetary targeting. The mission noted that the emergence of a possible overvaluation at the
end of 2005 (Box 1) coincided with the introduction of regulations limiting daily exchange
rate movements and is consistent with evidence of depreciation pressure in the MCI market,
where transactions are taking place at the

22.
To avoid undue movements in both interest rates and the exchange rate,
monetary and exchange rate policy operations must be fine-tuned. Staff encouraged the
BM to improve liquidity forecasts, introduce repurchase operations, and with the help of
Fund TA stimulate secondary government securities markets. The mission also discussed the
recent reforms to the MCI market, including the widening of the band in December 2006,

25

that seem to have activated interbank transactions based on firm quotations by narrowing the
spread between the transaction rate among banks outside the market and the MCI mid-rate.
The authorities also agreed to continue the present auction system until all price restrictions
are lifted and the MCI is sufficiently liquid; the BM could then undertake foreign exchange
sales for sterilization directly through the MCI market.
D. Strengthening the Business Environment
23.
To make Mozambique the most competitive economy in the South African
Development Community (SADC) by 2015 and the region’s location of choice for FDI,
the authorities, with the assistance of the World Bank, have drawn up a strategic action
plan to build the business environment MEFP ¶32).
•

Financial sector strategy. The mission, in close collaboration with the Financial Sector
Technical Assistance Program (FSTAP), which is based on the FSAP recommendations,
agreed with the BM on a three-year financial sector strategy to increase access to credit
and lower financing costs.17 The key elements are to (i) reinforce the BM’s supervisory
functions and make all banks compliant with international accounting, loan classification,
and provisioning standards (MEFP ¶27); (ii) address structural impediments to lending,
such as the cost of enforcing contracts, lack of collateral, and inadequate information on
creditors (Figure 2); and (iii) support sound expansion of the nonbank sector, including
microfinance, pension, and insurance institutions (MEFP ¶28).

•

Trade liberalization. The mission welcomed the reduction in customs duties on consumer
goods from 25 percent to 20 percent for all trading partners in January 2007; this extends
the preferential access granted to SADC countries in 2006.18 By observing the most
favored nation (MFN) principle, Mozambique should minimize the possibility of welfarereducing trade diversion as a result of its membership in a regional trade arrangement
(RTA). The authorities were concerned by delays in moving forward with the SADC
trade protocol among all members but reiterated its commitment to being a member of
only one RTA. The mission encouraged the authorities to move towards further broadbased MFN trade liberalization while at the same time striving to make SADC less
discriminatory to non-RTA members and to promote liberal rules of origin. However, as
discussed in the Diagnostic Trade Integration Study, realizing Mozambique’s full export
potential and promoting export diversification will depend on reducing the cost of doing
business.

An accompanying Selected Issues paper summarizes the forward-looking strategy, which benefited from an
overlapping World Bank FSTAP mission. An FSAP update planned in FY 2008 will take stock of reforms and
update the reform strategy.

recognized recent
progress in authorizing firms to publish their bylaws electronically and approval of a
new labor law that significantly decreases the costs of hiring and firing workers but
expressed concern about the substantial rise in fees charged for scanning freight in the
Maputo harbor. Moreover, infrastructure services, which are partly in the hands of
state-owned or public-participating institutions, are inadequate.19 This calls for a clear
diagnostic of who provides infrastructure and a coherent multisector strategy to
address gaps, through such means as transparent sales of remaining publicparticipating enterprises and public-private partnerships PPPs).20
E. Management of Natural Resources

24.
The government is committed to following international best practices in the tax
and transparency regime related to mining and petroleum resources (MEFP ¶¶ 37 and
38).21 Now that investors have more confidence in Mozambique, the authorities recognize
that generous tax exemptions that limit the contribution of new projects in these sectors are
not needed to attract quality investment. The Council of Ministers therefore approved a new
mining fiscal law (structural PC for the end of December 2006) and a new petroleum fiscal
19

Public-participating institutions are enterprises with some private equity participation.

20

The restructuring of public-participating enterprises is not expected to result in the budget absorbing
liabilities, although PPPs should be carefully managed to minimize fiscal risks by transparently reporting
contingent liabilities or quasi-fiscal operations in budget documents. The authorities have requested TA from
the Fund to improve the PPP regime.

21

To date, the only major petroleum project operating in Mozambique is the Pande-Temane natural gas
extraction project including a pipeline to South Africa. More recently, four international oil companies have
been granted the right to start drilling for oil in the Rovuma Basin, and a multinational mining company
announced that mining and heavy mineral concentrate production has started at its Moma Titanium Minerals
Mine in the northern Mozambican province of Nampula.

28

law that reduces such exemptions, which were approved by the Assembly in May 2007.22
Implementing regulations will be approved within 90 days. The Government will also adopt
the new model contracts for mining concessions (structural assessment criterion for the end
of June 2007), and exploration and production concession (EPC) contracts in the petroleum
sector by the end of September 2007 (structural assessment criterion) to complement the new
laws. In the interim, the government will ensure that any sizeable new mineral resource
project or EPC contracts in the petroleum sector will adhere to the new fiscal regime. The
government is also thinking about following the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative
(EITI) principles to improve transparency, revenue management, and governance in the
mining and petroleum sectors, as well as to govern expansion of related megaprojects.
25.
The transfer of ownership of the Cahora Bassa dam to Mozambique will adhere
to the principles agreed to in the PRGF-supported program (MEFP ¶35). An immediate
priority is to secure nonrecourse financing for the transfer of majority ownership of the
hydropower plant through the dam operating company, Hidroelétrica de Cahora Bassa
(HCB), so as not to increase the government’s liabilities to commercial creditors. The
government also reiterated its commitment to
•

Sustain transparency and accountability. Besides transparency of both the process
and the final financing package, authorities must ensure that HCB is (i) managed
in a commercially efficient way; (ii) audited by external auditors; and (iii) subject
to the regular concession and tax regimes.

•

Report on risk. Authorities must identify and incorporate into the fiscal accounts
and budget documents fiscal risks and any quasi-fiscal transactions.
F. Other Issues

26.
The risk of debt distress for Mozambique is low (Appendix II). The joint BankFund DSA shows that debt dynamics are sustainable under the baseline and stress tests,
though susceptible to a ratcheting up of nonconcessional and concessional external
borrowing. The authorities should therefore continue to rely as much as possible on
concessional borrowing and grants; the scope for undertaking large infrastructure projects on
commercial terms without jeopardizing debt sustainability is limited. Mozambique reached
bilateral agreements in the context of the Heavily Indebted Poor Country Initiative with all
Paris Club creditors except Portugal and Japan.23 Despite Mozambique’s best efforts, it has
22

29

been less successful in negotiating debt relief agreements with most of its non-Paris Club
bilateral creditors. Of those that have not delivered debt relief, negotiations with Algeria,
Libya, and Iraq are proving difficult. In this respect, the authorities look forward to
continuing support from the Fund to reach an orderly and rapid rescheduling with these
creditors. Mozambique is expected to benefit from a commercial debt buy-back operation in
2007 covering virtually all outstanding commercial debt in arrears (about US$175 million or
5 percent of total debt). A commitment to finance most of the operation has been secured
from the Government of Norway and the World Bank. The Fund concludes that the
authorities are making best efforts to conclude bilateral agreements with Japan, Portugal, and
its non Paris Club creditors with whom they have not yet reached bilateral agreements.
Further, the authorities are making good faith efforts to reach a collaborative agreement with
their commercial creditors.
27.
Mozambique has built a consensus to move toward current account
convertibility. Although Mozambique has eliminated all Article XIV restrictions, it
maintains restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international
transactions subject to Fund approval under Article VIII.24 The authorities intend to address
these restrictions at the time of approval of the new foreign exchange law, which was
submitted to the Assembly in May 2007 with a slight delay, and the issuance of related
regulations. Following the approval of the new law and issuance of related regulations, the
authorities intend to accept their obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the
Fund’s Articles of Agreement. The recent regulation pertaining to the import and export
transactions (Aviso 2) remains suspended and will be replaced by the issuance of a new one.
28.
The statistical agency is revising its historical national accounts series. It intends
to launch a new national accounts framework, including revision of annual GDP data rebased
to 2000 and dissemination of quarterly estimates, by the end of June 2007. TA in this area
could seek to support the efforts of the statistical agencies to accelerate dissemination of final
GDP estimates and improve the accuracy of national account aggregates, particularly in trade
and agricultural production. With regard to monetary statistics the BM, which is committed
to aligning its chart of accounts with the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual, has
requested TA from the Fund.

24

The restrictions pertain to: (i) the discretionary prior approval for remittances of family living expenses,
(ii) the authorization for the purchase of foreign exchange in excess of US$5,000 for certain transactions,
(iii) the prohibition for the conversion of balances of nonresidents’ domestic currency accounts into foreign
currency or transfer abroad, (iv) the prohibition on advance payments for a service, and (v) the prohibition on
advance payments for the import of goods.

The first year of the new three-year PSI will be monitored through quantitative
assessment criteria, quantitative indicative targets, and structural assessment criteria
and benchmarks set in the MEFP, Tables 1 and 3. Program conditionality is flexible,
accommodating as needed both spending and absorption of foreign aid, as in the last two
reviews of the PRGF-supported program. The performance criterion on the zero ceiling on
nonconcessional external debt is relaxed slightly, to be consistent with the budget law that
allows for accumulating a very small amount (US$2–3 million, less than 0.1 percent of total
debt) of nonconcessional debt. This aligns the program with the authorities’ own procedures
and supports independent oversight of government borrowing. Any future non-concessional
financing of large projects will need to be considered on a case-by-case basis based on their
economic return, availability of concessional finance, debt management capacity, and impact
on debt sustainability. Progress in finalizing the draft debt management strategy and building
capacity at the MF debt management unit will be closely monitored. The government intends
to continue using its current multidisciplinary committee to monitor the program, and the
research department of the MF will gather information on megaprojects and state-owned and
public-participating enterprises initiated early in 2007 (MEFP ¶39).
30.
With regard to risks, the staff notes that external shocks, fiscal slippages related
to upcoming elections, large nonconcessional external borrowing, and a hasty
implementation of fiscal decentralization, could undermine the government’s
macroeconomic targets.
31.
While the BM is making progress in implementing recommendations of the
safeguards assessment, weaknesses remain in financial reporting practices and the
internal audit function. The authorities are considering whether to request a voluntary
safeguards assessment with respect to the proposed Policy Support Instrument. The new
Anti-Money Laundering law was also approved by the Assembly in its current session,
paving the way for the creation of a financial intelligence unit (MEFP ¶42).
VI. STAFF APPRAISAL
32.
The economy has been resilient to numerous exogenous shocks. Real GDP growth
has picked up in 2006 led by a recovery in agricultural production and constructions activities
while the trade balance improved due to a surge in exports. The core and headline inflation
rates have fallen to single digit levels anchored by a prudent monetary stance, although they
were temporarily higher due to the evolution of food and domestic fuel prices. The outlook
for 2007 is for continued strong growth, 5–7 percent inflation, and a sustainable fiscal and
external position, though with some risks related to recent calamities and a further rise in oil
prices.

31

33.
There are policy challenges related to sustaining Mozambique’s growth takeoff
and achieve the MDGs. Impressive growth and foreign aid, including debt relief, helped
reduce poverty and improve social indicators. This was supported by the PRGF program,
which helped stabilize the economy in the face of exogenous shocks and monitored
completion of a first wave of reforms. The experience of countries that have kept growth
accelerating over the long run suggests a need to consolidate macroeconomic stability and
implement second-generation reforms, including a scaling-up of basic services to address
human capital and infrastructure gaps.
34.
The PSI is focused on consolidating macroeconomic stability as foreign aid is
scaled up. A major challenge is to firm up fiscal policy to finance additional priority
spending sustainably and ensure that aid-financed spending reaches the most productive and
propoor sectors. Emphasis should be given to collecting taxes and dividends from state
shareholding, particularly of natural resources, and managing the fiscal risks of PPPs.
35.
Institutional and capacity building need to keep pace with the rapid structural
transformation of the economy and facilitate the implementation of second-generation
reforms. The structural program aims at improving the business environment by deepening
the financial system and reducing the cost of doing business. Adoption of new model
contracts in the mining and petroleum sectors, and adherence to the principles of the new
fiscal regime and EITI will be important to ensure a virtuous cycle of natural resource use. A
better monitoring of megaprojects, and public and public-participating enterprises as well as
concessions to the private sector is also essential.
36.
The 2007 fiscal framework includes scaled-up foreign aid to pursue the MDGs.
To maintain macroeconomic stability, a continued 0.5 percent of GDP rise in domestic
revenue is targeted while the share of priority expenditures will exceed 65 percent of total
spending. The rollout of e-SISTAFE to all public entities at the central and provincial level,
and direct execution of a greater share of current spending should improve monitoring of
expenditures. The finalization of guidelines to include donor-funded projects in the CUT and
e-SISTAFE as well as the opening of a multicurrency CUT should be expedited to encourage
the donors to transfer projects on CUT. Performance budgeting could also be piloted
alongside a strengthening of sector strategies.
37.
The public sector reform program is at a critical juncture The installation of a
clean integrated payroll database based on a civil service census should help rightsizing the
civil service and improving service delivery. The implementation of the anti-corruption
strategy and judicial sector reform needs to be reinvigorated and results publicized, in order
for public perceptions of lack of progress to be reversed.
38.
The government’s fiscal decentralization strategy should be well sequenced. Lack
of clarity on the division of revenue raising and spending responsibilities of subnational
units, and concerns regarding the capacity of some districts and municipalities to effectively

32

absorb and account for resources need to be addressed first. Budgetary resources should not
be increased to subnational units that do not provide spending plans and report on their use.
39.
Greater exchange rate flexibility should help improve competitiveness. The
exchange rate level appears to be somewhat overvalued at present and thus staff calls on the
BM to eliminate the temporary exchange rate band as soon as possible. A flexible exchange
rate regime has served Mozambique well, helping to cushion against exogenous shocks and
maintain a comfortable level of international reserves. A fine-tuning of liquidity management
and deepening of interbank markets should also lead to a smoother transmission of monetary
policy actions.
40.
Large infrastructure projects should be carefully managed. The staff welcomes
the renewed commitment to seek non-recourse financing for the transfer of majority ownership of the Cahora Bassa hydropower plant from Portugal so not to increase the central
government’s liabilities to commercial creditors, and ensure transparency and accountability.
These principles should be applied to all future infrastructure projects whilst encouraging
greater private participation to reduce risks to debt sustainability.
41.
The implementation of the strategic action plan to reduce the cost of doing
business will be key to promote export diversification and generate employment. In this
regard, a good start has been made with regard to business registration but recent proposals
related to the labor market (both the draft labor and minimum wage legislation) need to be
implemented in a manner that reduces labor costs to firms. The high fees charged for
scanning freight should also be reviewed to help lower export/import transaction costs and
make Maputo a transshipment hub in Southern Africa.
42.
Mozambique’s banking system is making a growing contribution to private
sector development. Introduction of risk-based supervision and international reporting
standards should facilitate monitoring of capital adequacy during a period of strong credit
growth. The sustainability of the national pension fund (INSS) needs to be secured through a
restructuring based on an actuarial study. A strengthening of the supervisory framework for
the growing non-bank financial sector is becoming more important. However, the high cost
of and limited access to credit to SMEs and the agriculture sector indicates the need to step
up reform efforts to improve the institutional lending environment, as well as measures to
improve banks and MFI outreach in rural areas.
43.
The staff welcomes progress in liberalizing trade, debt rescheduling, and
exchange system reforms. The staff encouraged further broad-based MFN trade
liberalization and early adoption of a new foreign exchange regime to realize the authorities’
stated intentions to accept the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3 and 4 in the near
future. The authorities are encouraged to continue to negotiate in good faith with all of their
external creditors to reach an agreement consistent with that provided by the Paris Club.

33

44.
The authorities are encouraged to undertake a voluntary safeguards assessment
in the context of the proposed PSI.
45.
Given Mozambique’s track-record of strong macroeconomic performance and
program implementation, the staff welcomes the authorities’ request for a PSI.
46.
The staff recommends completion of the sixth review and financing assurances
review under the PRGF arrangement. Staff recommends a waiver for the missed
performance criterion on base money at end-year 2006 as it was temporary and related to the
currency reform. The staff also recommends the approval of foreign exchange restrictions
under Article VIII given the authorities stated intention to remove exchange restrictions
within one year.
47.
The staff welcomes the intention of the authorities to make public the staff
report, the letter of intent, and the MEFP.
48.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Mozambique take
place within 24-months subject to the provisions of the decision on consultation cycles
in program countries.

government blocked deposit account at the Bank of Mozambique.
2/ Balance declines from MDRI assistance by 0.5 percent of GDP corresponding to an agreed increase in government expenditures
contingent on MDRI assistance.
3/ On an annual average basis from December 2006 to December 2007, reserve money growth is 15.5 percent.

1/ Since this presentation still follows the fourth balance of payments manual, MDRI and HIPC grants from the IMF are included in the current account.
2/ The large amortization in 2006 reflects the repayment of IMF debt with MDRI resources.
3/ Private borrowing, not guaranteed by the government or the Bank of Mozambique.
4/ Tracks the movements in the government account set up abroad with the proceeds of the coal mine concession.

1/ Megaprojects include Mozal (aluminum production); Sasol (gas production and pipeline); the Cahora-Bassa dam (hydro-power); and two titanium ore projects.
2/ This line significantly overestimates the contribution of megaprojects to international reserve accumulation, because most of their financial operations
are conducted outside the domestic banking system. Only a small fraction of foreign exchange proceeds are actually repatriated in Mozambique. However,
information on the latter is not available.

Appendix I
Maputo, Mozambique
March 28, 2007
Mr. Rodrigo de Rato
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431
U.S.A.
Dear Mr. de Rato:
1.
The Government of Mozambique requests a three-year arrangement under the Policy
Support Instrument (PSI) before the expiration on July 5, 2007 of the current arrangement
under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF). This request is made at this stage
to avoid a vacuum between the two arrangements. The main elements of the new program are
consistent with our Plano de Acção para a Redução da Pobreza Absoluta II (or PARPA II)
and are described in the attached memorandum of economic and financial policies (MEFP)
covering the period 2007–2010. The MEFP also sets forth the objectives and policies that the
Government intends to pursue during 2007. The attached technical memorandum of
understanding (TMU) defines the terms and conditions of the program.
2.
The Government of Mozambique continues to make progress in implementing its
PRGF-supported program despite the severe floods that affected parts of the country during
the first months of 2007. All end-December quantitative performance criteria (PCs) were
met, except for the PC on base money, due to the temporary surge in currency in circulation
at the end of 2006 which was related to the currency reform. The structural PC and
benchmarks through end-March 2007 were also achieved, except for the benchmark related
to the treasury single account (CUT) which has been delayed to end-September 2007. In light
of the progress achieved in the implementation of our program, the Government of
Mozambique requests a waiver for the non-observance of the quantitative PC on base money.
3.
The resources released as part of the MDRI have been incorporated in the execution
of the 2007 budget and included in the medium-term fiscal framework (CFMP) to be spent
on poverty-reducing priority expenditures identified in the PARPA II.
4.
Looking ahead, the policies set out in the MEFP continue to aim to consolidate
macroeconomic stability and sustain strong broad-based growth through a second wave of
reforms in order to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Our PSI supported
program proposes assessment criteria for the performance target dates of end-June and end-

45

December 2007 for the first and second reviews as set out in Tables 1 and 3 of the MEFP,
which are expected to be completed by end-December 2007 and end-June 2008, respectively.
5.
The Government of Mozambique intends to accept its obligations under Article VIII,
Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement following the approval of the new
foreign exchange law which will be submitted to the Assembly by end-April 2007. The
government remains committed to a flexible exchange rate regime.
6.
The Government of Mozambique will provide the Fund with such information as the
Fund may request in connection with the progress made in implementing the economic and
financial policies and achieving the objectives of the program.
7.
The Government of Mozambique believes that the policies set forth in the MEFP are
adequate to achieve the objectives of our PSI program; it will take additional measures to that
end if deemed necessary. During the implementation of the arrangement, the Government of
Mozambique will consult with the Managing Director on the adoption of these measures and
in advance of revisions to the policies contained in the PSI, at the initiative of the
Government or whenever the Managing Director requests such a consultation.
Sincerely yours,

/s/
Manuel Chang
Minister of Finance

Attachment I
Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies of the Government of
Mozambique for the Sixth Review Under the PRGF Arrangement and for the PSI
Supported-Program (June 2007–June 2010)
March 28, 2007
1.
The Government of Mozambique is committed to continuing to consolidate
macroeconomic stability and to achieve sustained economic growth and poverty reduction
through the pursuit of prudent macroeconomic policies and a second wave of structural
reforms. The strategy to achieve these goals is set out in the Plano de Acção Para a
Redução da Pobreza Absoluta II (PARPA II) for which a Joint Staff Advisory Note was
approved by the Boards of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank (WB)
in December 2006. The current Government’s economic program is supported by the
IMF with a three-year arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility
(PRGF), which expires on July 5, 2007. The new program for 2007–2010 would be
supported by the IMF with a three-year arrangement under the Policy Support Instrument
(PSI). This Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) reviews the
performance under the PRGF-supported program (October 2006-March 2007) and
describes the policies and targets for the remainder of 2007.
I. RECENT PERFORMANCE UNDER THE PRGF-SUPPORTED PROGRAM
2.
In 2006, economic performance has been strong. Economic growth accelerated to
8.5 percent, led by a rebound in agricultural production after the localized drought of
2005 ended, as well as continued strength in the construction sector (related to
megaproject activity and a pick-up in donor-financed project execution). Prudent fiscal
and monetary policies helped lower the 12-month headline inflation rate down from its
peak in April of 17.7 percent to 9.4 percent in December 2006, and further to 5.4 percent
in February 2007. Strong exports, along with sustained foreign aid inflows, helped keep
net international reserves at a comfortable level (over 4 months of imports).
3.
The foreign exchange market has remained stable following the introduction of a
temporary exchange rate band in the interbank foreign exchange market (MCI) in
November 2005. The spread between the MCI rate and the rates charged by banks fell
below pre-band levels thanks to the measures taken by the Bank of Mozambique (BM) to
deepen the MCI through the introduction of a code of conduct among banks and
facilitating firm quotation.
4.
The 2006 currency reform went smoothly. The BM introduced a new family of
Meticais on July 1, 2006—1,000 Meticais equals to one of the new family of Metical
(MT). By end of February 2007, 94 percent of currency in circulation corresponded to the
new family of Metical. Because of the volatility in currency demand around the deadline
to exchange the old currency for the new, the PC on base money was missed at end-2006,
though it declined below the end-year target in January 2007.

47
5.
The fiscal position at end-2006 was better than programmed. Revenue collection
in 2006 is slightly above target led by continued buoyancy in corporate and personal tax
collection (including collection of tax arrears) and non-tax revenue. Current spending,
including the wage bill and locally financed investment was slightly lower than
programmed, resulting in a greater than expected consolidation of the domestic primary
deficit. Higher than anticipated program aid in 2006 also meant that net credit to the
Government from the banking system declined more than programmed (performance
criteria). The composition of spending improved, supported by donor-financed project,
with the share of priority expenditures in line with the 65 percent PARPA target.
6.
Progress has been made in reforming revenue administration and in widening the
tax base. The new Central Revenue Authority (ATM) is now fully operational with all the
senior and lower management appointed. The current reforms focus on establishing the
ATM as a sustainable, semi-autonomous agency with the aim of improving operational
performance and tax compliance. Three new collegial bodies were created as part of the
new ATM: (i) the High Tax Council; (ii) the "Directive" Council; and (iii) the Fiscal
Council, a consultative council. Progress has been made in incorporating the former
customs and tax directorates into the ATM and to create the General Directorate for
Common Services, an Office of Planning, Research and International Cooperation, and
Office of Internal Control. Legal, human resource and systems integration work have also
been prepared. A draft IT-strategy is ready for internal discussion and approval. In
addition, the following measures were implemented in 2006: (i) tax arrears continued to
be identified and collected; (ii) the number of taxpayers was increased by about 100,000
to 391,719; and (iii) about 500 tax audits were conducted. An ATM seminar held on
February 2007 concluded that there was a need to: (i) immediately prepare studies and
formulate recommendations in response to the revenue losses related to the Southern
African Development Community (SADC) tariff reductions in 2008; (ii) to continue the
process of simplification, decentralization, and broadening of the tax base; (iii) to prepare
a study (to be finalized by end 2007), operationalizing an "electronic one-stop-window"
through an integrated IT system in which both customs and tax IT systems are
incorporated; and (iv) to elaborate a plan to create a technical tax training institute by
end-December 2007.
7.
In the area of tax policy, the Council of Ministers approved and submitted to the
Assembly three laws on specific taxes and fiscal incentives in the mineral resource and
the petroleum sectors in December 2006 (structural performance criteria). A new fiscal
code for succession and donations, and a draft municipal finance and asset law was also
submitted to the Assembly. The latter aligns the finance and asset management of the
municipalities with the new financial and fiscal systems implemented over the last six
years.
8.
Public Financial Management (PFM) reforms have made good progress. The
medium-term fiscal framework (CFMP) is closely aligned with the objectives of
PARPA II, and was, for the first time, approved by the Council of Ministers in May 2006.
The 2006 budget also included an investment budget for each district supported by
strengthened planning capacity in some districts, though the reporting of utilization of

48
funds needs to be further strengthened. Specific measures in the medium-term PFM
Action Plan and Budget (APB) for 2006-2009 under implementation include:
a. After an initial 6 ministries, all budgetary operations for goods and
services of Financial Management Departments (DAFs) of 22 additional
ministries and organs, at the central and provincial levels, are since
January 2007 executed through the e-SISTAFE (structural benchmark).
This enables an effective direct budget execution according to the
sequence of commitment, verification, and payment. However, the level of
direct budget execution has increased slowly to about five percent of
payments for goods and services made through e-SISTAFE, while
95 percent of payments continue to be made on the basis of advance
payments.
b. The Inhassoro functionality allowing for the closure of the 2006 budget
and the production of the financial accounts of the State within eSISTAFE is operational since end-2006.
c. The census of the civil service is ongoing and is expected to be completed
as scheduled by end-April 2007 (structural benchmark).
d. The e-SISTAFE reporting functionality has been developed and is being
implemented.
e. Most G-18 donor-financed projects have been integrated into the 2007
budget ceilings. However, the opening of a limited number of separate
foreign currency accounts in the Single Treasury account (CUT)—a
benchmark for end-March 2007—is delayed until end-September 2007
(structural benchmark). In addition, the guidelines to facilitate the
inclusion of donor-financed projects on the CUT have not yet been issued
and are now envisaged by mid-May 2007.
9.
Monetary policy has remained prudent. Interest rates on government securities
continued to be determined by market forces following the removal of interest rate caps in
March 2006. Money velocity continued to decrease pointing to a deepening of the
financial sector. Credit growth to the economy has remained strong especially due to the
financing of petroleum imports and consumer loans. Net credit to the government (NCG)
was lower than programmed (performance criteria) while net international reserves
exceeded the floor by US$166 million (performance criteria). The indicative target on the
balance of the Government’s saving account set up abroad with the proceeds from the
coal mine exploration contract was lower than the floor programmed at end-December
2006 and end-March 2007. The funds were used for priority investment projects. In
December 2006, the BM widened the band in the MCI from 0.25 percent to 1 percent. In
addition, in order to strengthen the balance sheet of the BM, securities in an amount of
MT 1.5 billion were issued to BM in June 2006 as envisaged in the program.

49
10.
Prudential ratios of the banking system have remained sound. The ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans has remained below 5 percent while the requirement to
provision 50 percent of their foreign currency-denominated loans to nonexporters since
July 2005 has led to a deceleration in foreign currency credit growth. The commercial
banks are highly profitable but their level of capital adequacy is being closely monitored
in light of the overall strong growth in credit to the economy.
11.
To strengthen Bank supervision, a proposal on the new organizational structure of
the banking supervision department consistent with the Integral Strengthening Plan for
Banking Supervision was approved by end-December 2006. In addition the new
regulation on the assessment, classification and provisioning of credit and the regulation
on integral risk management for credit institutions and finance companies were approved
by end-March 2007. The Chart of Accounts of the commercial banking system was made
consistent with IFRS with some delay in March 2007.
12.
The remaining measures needed to address weaknesses identified in the context of
the Fund’s safeguard assessment mission conducted in June 2004, have now been
implemented. In the area of accounting, the BM has issued its 2006 financial statements
in compliance with IFRS in parallel to the financial statement prepared under the current
accounting standard. The reconciliation of monetary data with audited financial
statements and its review by the internal audit department was completed by endDecember 2006.
13.
Progress was also made to increase access to finance, in particular for rural
financing. The BM has reduced the legal reserves requirement from 11.51 to
10.15 percent, a level that is in line with the practice in the region. This should help bring
down the spread between deposit and lending rates along with other measures to reduce
overhead costs and improve competition among banks including by encouraging greater
transparency of fees and charges. Progress was also made improving the institutional
lending environment. In order to accelerate dispute settlement and debt recovery of
unsecured lending, the government has implemented a new Commercial Code, and
established commercial sections of the judicial tribunals in the cities of Maputo, Beira,
and Nampula. It has also set a strategy to promote rural financing through fiscal
incentives and measures to reduce operating costs, including the opening of five BM
agencies (with due regard to its cost) to facilitate the payment system and transfer of cash
to commercial bank branches.
14.
Progress on structural reforms also accelerated, particularly in the areas of the
public sector, cost of doing business, and governance reforms. The Council of Ministers
in October 2006 approved the second phase of the public sector reform strategic action
plan (2006–11). The Ministry of Industry and Trade has finalized a draft strategy for
reducing the cost of doing business climate in March 2007 as envisaged under the
program. In the area of trade reforms, in January 2007, the maximum import tariff rate for
consumer goods applicable to all trading partners was lowered from 25 to 20 percent.
With regard to the Justice sector, the Supreme Court concluded 66 percent more cases in
2006 than in the previous year while activities in provincial courts increased by

50
48 percent thus reducing the backlog of cases by 34,019 cases to 68,433 outstanding
cases. To accelerate the enactment of approved laws, the production of the Gazette of the
Republic has been assigned to the Ministry of Justice. However, the Penal Procedure
Code was not approved by Council of Ministers in December 2006 as envisaged under
the program.
15.
Some progress has been made in collecting the necessary information to monitor
adequately the megaprojects and public enterprises. While a unit to monitor the
megaprojects has not been created as envisaged under the program, the government has
decided to assign that responsibility to the research department within the Ministry of
Finance, whose functions include gathering information on megaprojects and public
enterprises.
II. OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES FOR THE THREE-YEAR PSI
16.
Our overriding objective is to sustain a high rate of growth and to further reduce
poverty in line with the PARPA II. Consolidating macroeconomic stability in the context
of scaled-up foreign aid is a necessary condition to meet this challenge by maintaining a
single digit inflation rate and preserving a comfortable level of foreign reserves. This is to
be achieved by implementing sound fiscal and monetary policies in the context of a
flexible exchange rate regime, as well as prudent public debt management and public
finance reforms. In this regard, the CFMP will be revised taking into account the latest
external financing envelope while continuing to target an average revenue increase of
0.5 percent of GDP a year and no recourse to financing from the domestic financial
system. The gradual strengthening of sector strategies and costing of programs in PARPA
II will help inform the revision of the CFMP, though addressing the variable quality of
work on the costing of policies and programs at the sector and district level remains a
priority to improve the overall planning and budgeting framework.
17.
At the same time, we need to persevere with the timely implementation of our
second wave of reforms to continue to improve public service delivery and create an
enabling environment for private sector activity. Particular emphasis will be on
implementing the second phase of the public reform program (2006–10) which consist of
three pillars; (i) human resource management including payroll systems; (ii) performance
evaluation and wage policy; and (iii) decentralization policy. Improving governance will
remain a priority through the firm implementation of our anti-corruption strategy at all
levels of the public service. We are also determined to make Mozambique’s business
environment one of the most competitive in Africa so as to achieve broad based growth,
and to benefit from Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and technology spillovers. We will
also ensure that our natural resources are managed transparently following the principles
of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) so that future generations reap
the maximum benefit of Mozambique’s rich endowment. The fight against pandemics,
and the improvement of human and physical capital, particularly infrastructure would
continue with the help of the international community. The Government intends to
continue to monitor its program with the existing multi-disciplinary committee, especially
through reinforced coordination between the BM and the Ministry of Finance (MF).

51
III. THE POLICY AGENDA FOR 2007
18.
Economic prospects for 2007 remain favorable with continued strong economic
growth and deceleration in inflation, albeit with risks related to the recent floods and
cyclone. Central to achieving these objectives will be a strengthening of fiscal policy
backed by a revenue increase of 0.5 percent of GDP and a prudent monetary policy. To
maintain competitiveness and a comfortable level of international reserves, the BM will
bestow greater exchange rate flexibility in the foreign exchange market. The structural
reform agenda is in line with the PARPA II strategic matrix.
19.
The 2007 budget envisages a scaling-up of aid and an associated increase in
priority spending focused towards achieving the PARPA II targets including sufficient
counterpart funds to ensure a smooth execution of donor-financed projects. There will be
no recourse to domestic financing. Despite a nearly 0.2 percent of GDP revenue loss
related to tariff reform, total domestic revenue is envisaged to rise by 0.5 percent of GDP
by broadening the tax base through a continued increase of the number of taxpayers (by
about 100,000), strengthening border control and limiting unwarranted customs
exemptions (revenues amounting to about 0.2 percent of GDP), collection of new tax
arrears amounting to about 0.3 percent of GDP, and quarterly updating of the specific fuel
tax rate. In line with our 2007 budget, the expenditure side will reflect a hiring of about
10,000 teachers and 3,000 health workers while counterpart funds have been increased to
cover scaled-up project financing. The share of spending on priority sectors (above
65 percent), particularly education, health, and infrastructure, has been agreed with the
donors and will be closely monitored.
20.
Following the immediate emergency response by the Disaster Management
National Institute (INGC) to the victims of the floods along the Zambezi river and
Cyclone Favio, the government developed a reconstruction plan estimated at
US$71 million and the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs launched
an emergency appeal for a further US$29 million to meet the short-to-medium term needs
of those hit by the flooding and by the Cyclone. The government, with the financial
assistance of the donor community, will assist the affected population and enterprises
with their basic needs and reconstruction of damaged infrastructure. However, in the
event that donor-financing is inadequate to cover the reconstruction plan, the government
may consider using the program adjustor to accommodate emergency fiscal outlays (up to
a maximum of about US$20 million).
21.
The government will continue to improve the efficiency of the tax system by
sequentially implementing its medium-term tax policy reform program benefiting from
Fund technical assistance. Progress on tax reform will be closely monitored within the
MF. By end-June 2007, the government will study options on how to compensate for the
further reduction in external tariffs that take place in 2008. In this regard, tax policy
measures will be defined to equalize the treatment of interest income on different assets,
streamline and simplify the tax system for small and medium-sized enterprises, update
excise tax rates, rationalize income tax benefits, and reduce VAT exemptions. An
external quantitative audit which sets the amount of arrears on VAT reform due to

52
contractors of large infrastructure projects, particularly in the road and water sectors, will
be conducted with financial support from donors by end-September 2007, to be approved
and decided upon by the Government by end-December 2007. On the basis of this audit a
payment schedule will be defined to clear the arrears. Going forward, the government will
ensure that VAT charged on supplies of projects be included in the final price of a
contract.
22.
The next phase of the revenue administration reforms (2007–10), to be supported
by a multi-donor common fund, will focus on implementing the ATM strategic plan, and
improving operational performance to help achieve the medium-term revenue targets. The
ATM will be established through three stages: a transition period to end-2007, a gradual
integration of the tax and customs agencies that will take place during 2008, and further
strengthening and consolidation in 2009 and 2010. Revenues administration measures
envisaged in 2007 include: (i) initiating procedures to recover tax arrears generated
during 2006; (ii) providing a better service to taxpayers by reducing the average time to
resolve VAT refund claims; (iii) implementing an audit plan for 2007 encompassing at
least 675 audits at the DGI aimed at broadening audit coverage for domestic taxes;
(iv) facilitating trade through the reduction of the average time to release imported goods
at the border; and (v) implementing the IT Plan (PDTI). The ATM will initially use a
basic information scoreboard and a basic set of operational performance indicators to
monitor progress in reforms. In the course of 2008, ATM will put in place a modern
management information system to measure performance of the tax administration’s core
functions at both strategic and operational level to evaluate the tax administration’s
efficiency and effectiveness, to guide management decisions, and to measure progress in
the implementation of ATM’s strategy.
23.
A number of specific measures in the medium-term PFM APB will be
implemented in 2007.
•

Following the completion of the census of the civil service, an integrated and
e-SISTAFE compatible payroll database will be developed—register of the
state employees (CAF)—enabling the MF to carry out salary payments via eSISTAFE by end-June 2007 (structural benchmark). The pensioners census
will be executed in a slightly different timeframe and the pension functionality
in e-SISTAFE will be completed by end-September 2007. In addition, by endSeptember 2007, the government will decide on the institutional
responsibilities for keeping the payroll and pension database updated.

•

Even with the introduction of the CAF, the calculation of salaries and pensions
(value of payment, value of tax to be retained, and classifications) will
continue to be made outside e-SISTAFE, and global salary payments to civil
servants who do not have a banking account will continue to be paid into the
line ministries salary accounts. As such, a business case (BC) will be
developed by end-September 2007 for a second phase allowing for the
automatic calculation of payroll and pension payments, as well as execution of
salaries and pension payments directly to recipients’ bank accounts, through eSISTAFE on a transactional basis.

53
•

UTRAFE will elaborate a BC presenting the various options with relation to eSISTAFE rollout to the districts. Conditioned on the approval of the BC, it is
foreseen that by the end of October 2007 a total of 27 districts will be
operating e-SISTAFE. By end September 2007, UTRAFE will present a plan
for further district and autarquia rollout in 2008.

•

The e-SISTAFE will be rolled out to all the remaining ministries at the central
and provincial levels listed in the TMU by end-December 2007 (structural
benchmark).

•

A business case will be finalized by end-September 2007, defining a list of
State organs at the central level for which the e-SISTAFE will be
progressively rolled out.

•

The Phase II of the budget formulation module will be tested and ready for use
and training by end-June 2007, to fit in with the 2008 budget calendar and
pilot cases of program budgeting. The latter uses a conceptual model agreed
between the MF and the Ministry of Plan and Development.

•

In close coordination with the ATM, a fully articulated BC will be prepared by
end-June 2007 to implement a revenue collection network (RCN) with which
all government revenues collection will be automated and classified before
being transferred to the CUT. UTRAFE is aiming at testing a functional
prototype by April 2008.

•

To facilitate the inclusion of all donor-financed projects within the CUT,
UTRAFE will put in production a pilot test of the multi-currency CUT by endSeptember 2007 aiming at full production by January 2008.

•

For the implementation of the asset management system and procurement
interface to e-SISTAFE, the development of requirement specifications will be
finalized and a tender launched by end-June 2007.

•

Through the development of a reliable and updated supplier data base and the
implementation of findings by the Government task force, the level of
effective direct budget execution (according to the sequence of commitment,
verification, and payment) for goods and services will be increased to
30 percent by end-September 2007, 50 percent by end-December 2007
(structural assessment criterion), and 75 percent by end-March 2008, and
90 percent by end-June 2008.

24.
On monetary policy, the BM will continue to target base money with a view to
achieving its inflation target. A long-term monetary policy strategy document was
approved by the executive board of the BM in October 2006 that defines an intermediate
target compatible with the base money operational target, a new format for the monetary
policy committee, and its communication policy. To achieve the inflation objective of
6 percent by end-2007, broad money growth will be limited to about 16 percent—or
slightly higher than nominal GDP growth— to take into account the ongoing financial
deepening. In addition, the monetary authority remains committed to a flexible exchange

54
rate regime and to that effect will continue to gradually widen the temporary exchange
rate band in the foreign exchange market when conditions permit.
25.
The BM will continue to improve liquidity management, and deepen financial
markets as part of the Financial Sector Technical Assistance Program (FSTAP). In this
context, the MF, in turn, will improve the preparation of cash-flow projections and
communicate it to the BM in a timely manner with Fund technical assistance. Moreover,
with Fund technical assistance, the BM will finalize a master repurchase agreement by
end-May 2007. The BM and the MF will agree, through a memorandum of understanding
(structural benchmark for end-September), to shift the costs of managing monetary policy
to the budget.
26.
In the area of public debt management, FSTAP supported reforms at the MF and
BM has gained momentum and is expected to intensify after the second quarter of 2007.
Following recommendations made in a debt management assessment report prepared by
an FSTAP consultant, the government intends to realign its debt management institutional
framework along international best practices. The MF intends to strengthen its staffing
complement, launch a multi-year training program, consolidate the debt database for all
public debt, start to publish debt reports regularly and design an integrated debt strategy
by end-2007.
27.
The BM will also continue to strengthen and modernize its supervisory functions
and implement the recently approved organizational changes in view of strengthening onsite and off-site monitoring. In this regard, training to adopt a risk-based supervision
approach will start in 2007, at which time the new inspection manuals will also be used.
The BM is implementing a timetable to adopt IFRS in the banking system in 2007. Based
on the results of the FSTAP study, to be completed by mid-2008, the application of IFRS
will also be extended to the corporate sector in January 2009 for large companies. This
will improve the ability of the financial system to evaluate the quality of their loan
portfolios. Further, new regulation on the assessment, classification and provisioning of
credits as well as a regulation on integral risk management for credit institutions and
finance companies have been approved and will become effective during the first
semester of 2007. The BM will issue its own 2006 financial statements in line with IFRS
in 2007.
28.
The Government is committed to supporting a sound expansion of the non-bank
financial sector. The BM will continue to license and supervise microfinance deposittaking institutions to facilitate enhanced access to finance by rural households and smalland-medium sized enterprises. Both the FSTAP and the IFAD supported Fundo de Apoio
à Reabilitação Económica (FARE) and the Rural Finance Support Program (RFSP) will
support the government’s efforts to improve access to finance, especially in rural areas.
The strengthening of the social security and supplementary pension system is also being
undertaken as part of a new law on social protection, which has been approved by the
Assembly. As part of the restructuring of the National Social Security Institute (INSS), an
actuarial study will be completed before the end of 2007. In the meantime, guarantees of
minimum benefits will be limited until the full study is carried out. Efforts to strengthen

55
the regulatory and supervisory framework of the insurance sector as well as the
institutional capacity of the Inspecção Geral de Seguros (IGS) are under way. The
Insurance Law is being reviewed to bring it in line with international best practices,
revised prudential and solvency requirements for Mozambican insurers are being
developed, while new IFRS-compliant Chart of Accounts for insurers would also be
designed. New supplementary pension funds regulations are to be presented to the
Council of Ministers for approval by September 2007.
29.
Regarding the foreign exchange system, a new foreign exchange law taking into
account comments from all stakeholders and the Fund, will be submitted to the Assembly
by end-April 2007. Following approval of the new law, the authorities intend to accept
their obligations under Article VIII sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of
Agreement. The recent regulation (Aviso 2/06) pertaining to the current import and
export transactions remains suspended and will be replaced by the issuance of a new one.
30.
In order to improve the trade regime, the government will continue in 2007
ongoing Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) negotiations, with technical advice
under the Integrated Framework. The government is also pursuing bilateral free trade
arrangements as recommended in the Diagnostic Trade Integration Study (DTIS).The
government is continuing its negotiations with Angola, Tanzania and Zambia in order to
reach trade agreements similar to the ones concluded with Zimbabwe and Malawi
in 2005.
31.
The Government looks forward to completing the buyback operation for its
commercial debt in September 2007 with the financial assistance of the World Bank and
the Government of Norway. The Government recognizes the importance of reaching
rescheduling agreements with all bilateral creditors in the context of the enhanced HIPC
Initiative. It has intensified efforts to negotiate with all Paris Club and non-Paris Club
creditors that have not yet delivered debt relief, and hopes that progress would be made in
reaching agreements with its remaining creditors, including commercial creditors, as soon
as possible. In this regard the Government of Mozambique looks forward to the
continuing support of the Bretton Woods institutions.
32.
The Government of Mozambique is conscious that despite its efforts to improve
its investment climate during the year 2006, its ranking in the ease of doing business, as
assessed in the Doing Business report 2007, has worsened to 140th place. The recent
authorization to publish the bylaws of firms electronically would help to improve the
ranking. However, it is not sufficient to make Mozambique’s business environment the
most competitive in SADC by 2015. To address this challenge and significantly improve
the investment climate in Mozambique, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has
developed a draft strategic action plan for 2007–12 covering business start-up and
registration, licensing, business inspections, labor costs, access to credit, cost of energy,
and property registration. The World Bank has provided comments on the strategy and
will provide further assistance in the development of the strategic action plan. An
interministerial committee has been setup to monitor the implementation of this plan. In
2007, the two key actions envisaged will include:

56
(i) Reducing the cost of inspections and fines while improving compliance. The
authorities intend to adopt a system of inspections that will be simplified, business
friendly and harmonized across the several ministries that undertake inspections;
and
(ii) Simplifying the procedures of closing businesses. Through a new insolvency
law that will be submitted to the Council of Ministers by end-September 2007, the
Government intends to simplify the business closing process and increase the
recovery rate with the objective of helping viable businesses to overcome a shortterm cash flow crisis, and insolvent businesses to be rapidly liquidated.
33.

In 2008, the three key actions envisaged are:
(i) Reducing the licensing burden. To speed up the licensing process, the Ministry
of Industry and Trade is in the process of setting up “One-Stop-Shops” for
licenses at the provincial level. Additionally, through the Inter-Ministerial
Commission mechanism, the licensing process will be streamlined, and the
number of licenses required will be reduced;
(ii) Facilitating trading across borders. The Government will carry out a review of
the import and export procedures, with financial assistance from the international
community and will implement the recommendations of that study with the
specific aim of reducing documents, signatures and the amount of time required
for both importing and exporting; and
(iii) Improving the system for VAT reimbursement. The Directorate of Taxes and
Audits will implement a system to improve collection, including through the
prosecution of non-compliant institutions and expediently channeling these funds
back to those firms that are in compliance with the VAT system.

34.

In 2009, the four key actions envisaged are:
(i) Consolidate the progress in streamlining and reducing licenses for all sectors;
(ii) Consolidate the progress in facilitating trading across the borders. By end
2009, Mozambique should be as efficient at its borders as South Africa in the
clearance of goods for both imports and exports. This will require reducing the
number of documents filled out by at least half.;
(iii) Simplification of Tax Filing. Electronic filing of taxes should be provided and
forms should be simplified to reduce the time required for tax preparation; and
(iv) Property Registration. Amendment of the relevant legislation to speed up the
registration process by improving communication among different government
agencies and developing an electronic database for the real estate registry. All
registrable acts will be exempted from the requirement of prior execution of
public deeds.

35.
The Government will continue to restructure and encourage public-private
partnerships, particularly in infrastructure services. Public-private partnerships and sale of

57
state assets (and concessions) will be undertaken transparently in line with international
best practices. A decision was made by the Council of Ministers in May 2006 to develop
a new restructuring plan for PETROMOC that would improve efficiency. The new
restructuring plan will be completed by end-June 2007 for its adoption by the Council of
Ministers by end-September 2007. For the purchase of shares in Cahora Bassa, the
Government remains committed to a non-recourse financing of the outstanding payment
of US$700 million to Portugal and ensuring transparency of the financing package and
operations. While strengthening the investment planning capacity of the Ministry of
Energy, the Government, with the assistance of its financial advisors, is now in the
process of selecting strategic investors for: (i) Temane gas-fired generation project (about
750MW); (ii) Moatize coal power project (about 1,500MW); and (iii) Mphanda Nkuwa
hydropower plant (about 1,300MW). To support these new generation projects, there
would be a need to build a major transmission line to distribute the power to the
Mozambican market and for export. For all these projects, the Government will ensure,
with the help of the World Bank and other partners, that: (i) financing is non-recourse and
does not increase central government liabilities; and (ii) maximizes private sector
investments through the use of public-private partnerships with any equity stake by the
state-owned electricity company (Electricidade de Moçambique, EDM) raised through
concessional borrowing or without government guarantees. The Government with the
help of the World Bank and other partners will also continue to put in place measures to
assist EDM to improve its performance, including through a performance contract and the
operationalization of the regulator (CNELEC) by end-June 2007. In general, the
government will, across all sectors seek to buttress regulatory bodies, including
monitoring of concessions.
36.
Aeroportos de Moçambique (ADM) commissioned a project-financed report on
options for airport infrastructure financing which was completed in August 2006. While
the proposed Maputo Airport Concession (ACSA) has been cancelled, ADM is now
seeking to mobilize funds for its Investment Plan, estimated at US$94 million, including
the Modernization of Maputo Airport Infrastructure (about US$46 million) through only
concessional borrowing.
37.
To strengthen the management of natural resources, the government will issue
regulations to the new Mining and Petroleum Fiscal Regime laws within 90 days once
they have been approved by the Assembly. The Government will adopt the new model
contract for mining concessions to complement the new law submitted to the Assembly
(structural assessment criterion at end-June 2007). The model contract for the petroleum
sector will be adopted by end-September 2007 (structural assessment criterion).The
Government also remains committed to ensuring that any new mineral resource project
agreements will adhere to the principles of the new law and its proposed regulations, and
is using a model mining contract in its current round of negotiations, as well as new fiscal
model to develop the capacity to undertake timely feasibility studies and financial
modeling. The Government has also requested TA from the Fund to make the model
petroleum contract more specific, and narrow the range of items for bidding or
negotiation. In the interim, the Government is committed to avoiding signing any new
Exploitation and Production Concession Contracts (EPCs) in the petroleum sector until a

58
new comprehensive petroleum fiscal regime is in place that would be embodied in the
general tax law so as to avoid case by case negotiation of petroleum tax terms.
38.
Improving transparency remains a priority for the Government. The Government
intends to follow the EITI principles with regard to management of natural resources. The
Government has already participated in a seminar in Oslo in 2006 on the EITI principles
and will participate in a seminar in Maputo in 2007. The Government will consider
becoming a member of the EITI in the future. In this regard, an EITI scoping study is
planned under the Ministry of Planning and Development to assess the barriers to
implementation and the net financial benefits and improvement in investment climate
likely to accrue to Mozambique from the adoption of the EITI principles. Thereafter all
new related agreements, in particular the future exploitation of coal, oil, titanium and
natural gas as well as any new megaprojects (or expansion of existing megaprojects) will
follow the EITI principles.
39.
The monitoring of megaprojects and public enterprises in the research department
of the MF will be further strengthened including through the compilation of a
comprehensive database of financial information.
40.
The Council of Ministers approved the Phase II of the public sector reform
program (2006–11) building on the lessons from the implementation of the Phase I of this
program (2001–05). The Phase II document sets four priorities for the public sector
reform program: (i) the improvement of the delivery of public services to citizens and the
private sector; (ii) the strengthening of the capacity of the local organs of the state which
includes the implementation of a decentralization policy and strategy; (iii) the
professionalization of public servants including introduction of performance evaluation
systems and wage policy; and (iv) the strengthening of governance and anti-corruption
systems. A special role is provided to districts as the focus of development which will be
supported by improved planning, financial control, and operation of the new procurement
system up to the district level. Public sector accountability through external and internal
audits will be improved by reinforcement of the capacity of the Tribunal Administrativo,
the supreme audit institution in Mozambique, and capacity building of the Inspector
General of Finances. Importantly, a decentralization policy will be appraised by the
Council of Ministers by end-June 2007 and submitted to the Assembly. Subsequently, a
decentralization strategy will be approved by the Council of Ministers by June 2008. The
strategy will propose, among other things, a clear legal, regulatory, and institutional
framework for revenue raising and spending responsibilities and functions of subnational
units (provinces, districts, and municipalities) and monitoring of subnational fiscal
operations. The sequencing of the strategy will pay due regard to the administrative
capacity of subnational units and need to maintain fiscal control. The results of the census
will be incorporated in a preliminary wage policy to be discussed by the Council of
Minister by end-November 2007 and implemented in the context of the 2009 budget. The
next steps include the collection of baseline data for monitoring and evaluation of the
results of the activities to be undertaken within the aforementioned priorities.

59
41.
With regard to government's anti-corruption strategy, operational plans were
developed in five sectors (Judicial, Interior, Finance, Education and Culture, and Health)
in 2006 and completed in January 2007. Such plans form the National Action Plan to
Fight Corruption and were submitted to the first session of the Anti-Corruption Forum in
March 2007. The dissemination of the actions and outcomes to be undertaken by these
sectors was initiated in a national workshop for the launching of the oversight and
monitoring organs of the anti-corruption strategy that took place in March 2007 and was
opened by the President of the Republic. The main organ that was set is the National
Anti-corruption Forum chaired by the Prime Minister and having the Attorney-General as
vice-chair. The Forum has 78 members and its other members include parliamentarians,
religious leaders, representatives of business associations, trade unions, NGOs, and of the
11 provincial anti-corruption forums. Expected to meet once a year its routine work will
be undertaken by small technical supervisory unit, headed by the director of the Central
Office for the Fight Against Corruption (which operates from the Attorney-General's
Office). The next step will be the setting of the baseline data for the monitoring of the
various indicators included in the National Action Plan to Fight Corruption.
42.
In the context of the implementation of the Anti-Money Laundering Law, the
Government is also committed to creating a financial intelligence unit as soon as the law
is adopted by the Assembly, hopefully during its current session.
43.
The urban land use Regulation was approved by the Council of Ministers in
October 2006, which will facilitate the reduction of costs and time involved in
transactions. The Lei do Ordenamento do Território has been submitted to the Assembly
for approval. The Government remains committed to conducting an economic analysis of
urban land markets with a view to understanding how these function in practice, as well
as assessing the associated poverty reduction impact analysis of urban tenure regulations
and monitoring the implementation of the Land Law and its regulations. The survey of
land holding in some selected districts in the southern part of the country will end in June
2007 and the titling after digitization is expected to be completed by the end of 2007.
Finally, the Government is also preparing a draft strategy for slum upgrading.
44.
The Government is committed to reinvigorate the reform of the judicial reform
with the help of the international community. The main priority for the coming year is the
redrafting of an integrated strategic plan for the justice system by June 2007, to set up a
joint monitoring system for the entire legal sector, to strengthen mechanisms of sector
coordination, and to draw up a vision of justice. The organic law of judicial tribunals is
expected to be approved by the Assembly in the current session of the Assembly.
Commercial and labor sections of the judicial tribunals will be expanded with the help of
the international community. A new bankruptcy law and the Code of Penal Procedures
will also be approved by the Council of Ministers and submitted to the Assembly by endSeptember 2007.
45.
The Government is continuing its efforts to improve the quality of
macroeconomic statistics in order to improve policy formulation and the monitoring of
economic developments. To that end, the INE is aiming to launch a new national accounts

60
framework, including revision of annual GDP data and quarterly estimates by end-June
2007. With regards to monetary statistics, the BM is committed to aligning the chart of
accounts with the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual, including a breakdown
between local and foreign-currency denominated accounts. The BM is also aiming to
improve the quality of its external sector statistics, including by improving the coverage
of megaprojects. With regards to government finance statistics, significant improvements
have been made as a result of the launch of e-SISTAFE. However, the Government
understands that further work is needed to expand the institutional and transactional
coverage sufficient for compilation of the Funds in accordance with Government Finance
Statistics (GFS) manual of 2001.
IV. PROGRAM MONITORING
46.
The semiannual quantitative assessment criteria for end-June 2007 and endDecember 2007 and indicative targets for end-September 2007 which will be used to
evaluate the implementation of the program for the remainder of 2007 are shown in
Table 1 of this memorandum, with further definitions and explanations contained in the
annexed Technical Memorandum of Understanding. In addition, the Government has
specified in Table 3 a list of structural assessment criteria and benchmarks for 2007.
47.
The Government understands that the completion of the first review is contingent
upon the observance of the assessment criteria for end-June 2007 set out in Table 1 and 3;
which is expected to take place before end-December 2007. In reviewing developments
under the program during the first review, particular attention will be paid to the
implementation of measures aimed at broadening the tax base and further developing eSISTAFE, the 2008 budget, monetary and financial sector reform, reducing the cost of
doing business, infrastructure financing with due regard to debt sustainability, and
improving the fiscal regime and transparency of natural resource exploitation and
megaprojects as well as their net contribution.

Attachment II
Technical Memorandum of Understanding on Selected Concepts, Definitions, and Data
Reporting Under Mozambique’s Policy Support Instrument Program
March 28, 2007
1.
This technical memorandum of understanding (TMU) purpose is to describe the
concepts and definitions that will be used in monitoring the Policy Support Instrument (PSI)
program, including the following:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

net claims on the central government by the banking system;
government revenue;
net international reserves, and reserve money of the Bank of Mozambique;
new nonconcessional external debt contracted or guaranteed by the central government or
the Bank of Mozambique with a maturity of more than one year;
short-term external public debt outstanding;
external payments arrears; and
foreign program assistance and external debt service.

This memorandum also describes the adjusters that will be applied to certain quantitative
assessment criteria of the program.
Net Claims on the Central Government by the Banking System
2.
Net claims on the central government (NCG) by the banking system is defined as
the difference between the outstanding amount of bank credits to the central government and
the central government's deposits with the banking system, excluding deposits in project
accounts with the banking system and proceeds from the signing fee for coal exploration.
Credits comprise bank loans and advances to the government and holdings of government
securities and promissory notes. NCG will be calculated based on data from balance sheets of
the monetary authority and commercial banks as per the monetary survey. The limits on the
change in net claims on the central government by the banking system will be cumulative
beginning end-December 2006 for the 2007 program.
3.
The government encompasses all institutions whose revenue and expenditure are
included in the state budget (orçamento do Estado): central government ministries, agencies,
and the administration of 11 provinces. Although local governments (33 municipalities or
autarquias) are not included because they are independent, the bulk of their revenue is
registered in the state budget as transfers to local governments.
Government revenue and financing
4.
Revenue is defined to include all receipts of the Domestic Tax Administration
(Administração Tributaria de Impostos or DGI), the National Directorate of Customs
(Direcção Nacional de Alfândegas, DNA), and nontax revenue, including certain owngenerated revenues of districts and some line ministries as defined in the budget. Net receipts

65
from privatization received by the National Directorate of State Assets (Direcção Nacional
do Patrimônio do Estado) and unrealized profits transferred by the central bank to the
treasury will not be considered as revenue (above the line) and will be accounted for as other
domestic financing (below the line).
5.
For the purpose of program monitoring, revenue is considered as collected at the time
when it is received by the DGI from private agents or other government collecting agencies,
in cash or checks, or through transfers into a DGI bank account.
6.
An indicative target consisting of semiannual floors on the resources in the
government’s savings fund abroad has been added to monitor the use of the proceeds from
the signing fee for coal exploration.
Money supply
7.
Base money is defined as the sum of currency issued by Bank of Mozambique (BM)
and the commercial banks’ deposits in the BM. The commercial bank deposits include the
statutory required reserves and excess reserves held at the BM. The base money ceilings
for 2007 will be the total stock of base money outstanding at end-June 2007, endSeptember 2007 and end-December 2007, and will be monitored by the monetary authority
and provided to the IMF by the BM.
Net international reserves
8.
Net international reserves of the Bank of Mozambique are defined as reserve assets
minus reserve liabilities. The Bank of Mozambique’s reserve assets include (a) monetary
gold; (b) holdings of SDRs; (c) reserve position at the IMF; (d) holdings of foreign exchange;
and (e) claims on nonresidents, such as deposits abroad (excluding the government’s savings
account related to the Moatize coal mine concession). Reserve assets exclude assets pledged
or otherwise encumbered, including but not limited to assets used as collateral or guarantee
for a third–party external liability (assets not readily available.) The Bank of Mozambique’s
reserve liabilities include (a) all short-term foreign exchange liabilities to nonresidents with
original maturity of up to and including one year; and (b) all liabilities to the IMF.
9.
The Bank of Mozambique will publish the exchange rates quoted by commercial
banks on average as the market rates.
New nonconcessional external debt contracted or guaranteed by the central government
or the Bank of Mozambique with maturity of more than one year
10.
The term “debt” will have the meaning set forth in Point 9 of the Guidelines on
Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt adopted on August 24, 2000. Government
debt is outstanding debt owed or guaranteed by the central government or the Bank of
Mozambique (but does not include debt of any political subdivision or government-owned
entity with a separate legal personality that is not otherwise owed or guaranteed by the
central government).

66
11.
The central government will limit contracting or guaranteeing external debt up to
US$3 million with original maturity of one year or more with a grant element of less than
35 percent, calculated using currency-specific discount rates based on the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) commercial interest reference rates in
accordance with the Budget Law. This assessment criterion applies not only to debt as
defined in point 9 of the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt
adopted on August 24, 2000, but also to commitments contracted or guaranteed for which
value has not been received. This assessment criterion will be assessed on a continuous basis.
Stock of short-term external public debt outstanding
12.
The central government will not contract or guarantee external debt with original
maturity of less than one year. This assessment criterion applies not only to debt as defined in
point 9 of the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt adopted on
August 24, 2000, but also to commitments contracted or guaranteed for which value has not
been received. Excluded from this assessment criterion are short-term, import-related trade
credits. This assessment criterion will be assessed on a continuous basis.
External payments arrears
13.
The government undertakes not to incur payments arrears on external debt owed or
guaranteed by the central government, with the exception of external payments arrears
arising from government debt that is being renegotiated with creditors, including Paris Club
creditors. This assessment criterion will be assessed on a continuous basis.
Foreign program assistance
14.
Foreign program assistance is defined as grants and loans received by the Ministry of
Finance through Bank of Mozambique accounts excluding those related to projects (Table 1).
Actual external debt-service payments
15.
Actual external debt-service payments are defined as cash payments on external debtservice obligations of the government and central bank, including obligations to Paris Club
and other bilateral creditors rescheduled under enhanced HIPC Initiative completion point
terms, multilateral creditors, and private creditors, but excluding obligations to the IMF
(Table 1).
Adjusters
16.
The quantitative targets (floors) for the central bank’s net international reserves will
not be adjusted for any excess in disbursements of foreign program assistance (and any
shortfall in external debt service), compared to the program baseline. These targets will be
adjusted downward by 100 percent of any shortfall in external program aid (up to a
maximum of US$50 million) and any excess in external debt service payments, compared to
the program baseline (Table 1). The quantitative targets (floors) for the central bank’s net
international reserves will be adjusted downward/upward for any revision made to the end-

67
year figures corresponding to the previous year. They will also be adjusted upward for the
full amount of any external privatization proceeds in excess of those envisaged in the
program, unless these proceeds are deposited in the government’s savings account abroad. If
they are deposited abroad, the indicative targets on the balance in this account will be
adjusted upward for the full amount of the higher than envisaged proceeds, net of any costs
related to the privatizations, including severance payments. The quantitative targets (floors)
for the central bank’s net international reserves will be adjusted equivalently downward up to
a maximum of US$50 million per annum by the amount that the projected fuel import bill is
higher due to a rise in the average global oil price (average petroleum spot price of West
Texas Intermediate, U.K. Brent, and Dubai Fateh crude). This adjustment will be equal to the
difference between the realized and the projected average global oil price, multiplied by the
volume of total fuel imports projected for each quarter (Table 2). In addition, the quantitative
targets (floors) for the central bank’s net international reserves will be adjusted upward
(downward) by the amount of donor-financed projects deposited in the MT single treasury
account (CUT) if they are higher (lower) than projected for each quarter (Table 1)
17.
The quantitative targets (ceilings) for net claims on the central government (NCG)
will not be adjusted for any excess in disbursements of foreign program assistance (and any
shortfall in external debt service), compared to the program baseline. These targets will be
adjusted upward by 100 percent of any shortfall in external program aid (up to a maximum of
US$50 million) and any excess in external debt service payments, compared to the program
baseline (Table 1). These targets will also be adjusted downward for the full amount of any
privatization proceeds in excess of those envisaged in the program, unless these proceeds are
deposited in the government’s savings account abroad. The quantitative targets (ceilings) for
NCG will be adjusted downward (upward) for any increase (decrease) in domestic financing
from the non-financial private sector. The government expenditures contingent on higher
disbursements of foreign program assistance (and lower external debt service) will be used to
finance greater “priority” spending identified in the budget.
18.
The quantitative target (ceiling) for net claims on the central government (NCG) for
end-June 2007, end-September 2007 and end-December 2007 will be adjusted upward (and
the floors on net international reserves adjusted downward) to accommodate the possible
need for higher locally financed government outlays to deal with natural disasters, up to a
total limit of MT 500 million.
19.
The base money ceiling will be adjusted equivalently upward up to a maximum of
MT 300 million at end-June 2007, end-September 2007, and end-December 2007 to the
extent that the outstanding stock of currency issued by the BM exceeds those projected in
Table 3.

68
Data reporting
20.
In addition to providing the monthly and quarterly data needed to monitor program
implementation in relation to the programs’ quantitative targets and broader economic
developments, the authorities will provide weekly updates of the daily data set out in Table 3
as well as the weekly data set out in Table 4 of the TMU dated May 26, 2005. Monthly
updates will also be provided of the foreign exchange cash flow of the Bank of Mozambique.
21.
The government will continue to provide Fund staff with the data corresponding to
monthly government revenues (in detail according to the fiscal table), with a lag not
exceeding one month. In addition, the government will continue to publish and provide Fund
staff with the quarterly budget execution reports with a time lag not exceeding 45 days.
22.
In addition, the government will provide monthly information on the balance of its
savings account abroad and will start developing and providing information on domestic
arrears on a quarterly basis.
23.
From December 2005 onwards, the monetary survey made available by the Bank of
Mozambique will clearly identify donor-financed project deposits (with a breakdown
between foreign and domestic currency) included in net credit to the government in both the
central bank’s and commercial banks’ balance sheets.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
MOZAMBIQUE
Joint World Bank/IMF Debt Sustainability Analysis
Prepared by the staffs of the International Development Association and
the International Monetary Fund
Approved by Vikram Nehru and Sudhir Shetty (World Bank)
and David Nellor and Anthony Boote (IMF)
May 16, 2007
This analysis assesses the sustainability of Mozambique’s external public and domestic debt.
The debt sustainability analysis (DSA) was conducted jointly by the staffs of the IMF and the
World Bank using the joint Bank-Fund framework for debt sustainability analysis for lowincome countries. The bilateral external debt data underlying this DSA were provided by the
Mozambican authorities. The multilateral debt data provided by the authorities were
reconciled with information obtained from the creditors. On the basis of this DSA, the staffs
conclude that the risk of external debt distress for Mozambique is low.
I. BACKGROUND
1.
At end-2006, Mozambique’s external public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) debt
stock, including arrears,1 stood at US$3.2 billion in nominal terms or US$706.6 million
in NPV terms (Table 1). Of this, 36 percent was owed to multilateral creditors, 59 percent to
bilateral creditors, and about 5 percent to commercial creditors. Thanks to the Multilateral
Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), from the IMF, the International Development Association
(IDA) of the World Bank, and the African Development Fund (AfDF), the debt stock fell by
US$1.9 billion in nominal terms in 2006.2

1

Arrears to bilateral creditors amounted to approximately US$1.2 billion, and include moratorium arrears to
Portugal and Japan. Arrears to commercial creditors, US$157 million were covered by the debt-buy back
facility.

2

The amount of MDRI relief provided by the IMF was US$120.6 million; IDA provided US$1.3 billion; and
AfDF provided US$464.5 million.

2

2.
Previously, Mozambique has benefited from HIPC assistance provided by
multilateral and Paris Club bilateral creditors.3 Bilateral agreements were reached with
all Paris Club creditors except Portugal and Japan, who together account for about 20 percent
of total Paris Club debt at end-2000 in NPV terms.4 The Mozambican authorities are making
best efforts, however, to reach debt cancellation agreements with Portugal and Japan in 2007.
Mozambique signed an agreement with France regarding the cancellation of all outstanding
debts in April 2007. Russia recently announced its intention to cancel 100 percent of debt to
HIPCs that reach completion point. Mozambique authorities are in touch with the Russian
embassy in Maputo to finalize this process.

Memorandum and Recommendation and Completion Point Document” (IDA/R2001–0150).

4

In February 2005, Mozambique signed a technical memorandum with Portugal, in which Portugal confirmed
that it would provide 100 percent debt service reduction. Subsequently, however, Portugal added a clause to this
agreement which Mozambique has refused to accept, because it considers it to be not on comparable terms.
Japan, has also repeatedly indicated intentions for 100 percent debt reduction, but an agreement has not yet been
signed due to delays of an administrative nature.

3

3.
Thus far, Mozambique has not been that successful in negotiating debt relief
agreements with some of its non-Paris Club bilateral creditors. Negotiations with Algeria,
Libya, and Iraq are proving difficult despite Mozambique’s best efforts. Negotiations with
India are reportedly progressing slowly. The Chinese government cancelled Mozambique’s
outstanding debt in February 2007 and Kuwait provided comparable treatment with the Paris
Club.
4.
Mozambique benefited from a commercial debt buy-back operation in 2007.
This operation covered all outstanding commercial debt in arrears, which was estimated at
US$175.4 million at end-2006. The Government of Norway and the World Bank (IBRD)
financed the operation.

6.
Mozambique’s domestic
public debt stock is dominated by
recapitalization bonds and treasury
bills issued to mop up excess
liquidity. The total stock of domestic
public debt (treasury bills and bonds)
was about 8 percent of GDP at end2006, which is low by regional levels.
The Ministry of Finance ceased issuing
treasury bills for deficit financing
purposes in 2006, therefore the total
stock of outstanding treasury bills have
been issued by the Bank of

Total external debt in
Mozambique has a significant
private component due to
“megaproject” related lending.
Private external debt averaged
24 percent of the country’s total
external debt during the period 2001–
06. Most of the megaproject
investments were debt-creating, as
evidenced by the correlation between
FDI inflows and private borrowing

Mozambique on behalf of government for sterilization purposes. The majority of the stock of
treasury bonds are accounted for by bonds issued to recapitalize the central bank in 2005 and
2006 (following losses incurred during 2004), and related to the process of restructuring
commercial banks, which is now complete. The rest of the treasury bonds with a maturity
ranging from 1–10 years are held by the general public and financial sector.
II. METHODOLOGY AND KEY ASSUMPTIONS
7.
Following the guidelines of the LIC debt sustainability framework, staffs have
analyzed the evolution of the external public debt stock and debt service indicators for
Mozambique under a baseline scenario and a series of stress tests.6 The stress tests are
designed to assess the probability of a country facing debt distress in the future under
common shocks. In addition, staffs have considered the effect of an increase in
nonconcessional external new borrowing by US$1 billion in 20087 and a persistent scaling-up
of external borrowing of US$200 million from 2008–15.8 The purpose of the first countryspecific scenario is to illustrate the potential impact of undertaking large infrastructure
projects that increase the central government’s liabilities to commercial creditors. The
scaling-up scenario is intended to illustrate the fiscal space available to scale-up concessional
external borrowing focused on achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).9
8.
The analysis is guided by indicative, performance-based debt burden thresholds,
which take into account the empirical finding that the debt levels that a low-income
country can sustain increase with the quality of its policies and institutions. The quality
of policies and institutions is measured by the three-year average Country Policy and
Institutional Assessment (CPIA) of the World Bank, according to which Mozambique ranks
as a ‘medium performer’. The indicative external debt burden thresholds for countries in this
category are an NPV of debt-to-exports ratio of 150 percent, NPV of debt-to-revenue ratio of
250 percent, a NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio of 40 percent, and debt-service-to-exports and
revenues ratios of 20 and 30 percent, respectively.10

6

The Executive Boards of the Fund and the Bank approved the Operational Framework for Debt Sustainability
Assessments in Low-Income Countries in April 2005 (http://www.imf.org/External/np/pp/eng/2005/
032805.htm) and IDA/R2005-0056).
7

The assumed terms of this loan are a grace period of one year, total maturity of 10 years, and an interest rate of
8 percent.

8

External borrowing from bilateral donors is assumed to be higher by US$200 million each year from 2008
onwards until 2015.

9

It is also based on the indication from donors of a possible further scaling-up of foreign aid of about
US$200 million (or 2 percent of 2008 GDP) over the medium term, which is unlikely to be all grants.

10

The NPV of external debt-to-revenue ratio excludes all grants.

5

9.
The baseline scenario is subject to a number of assumptions. The underlying
macroeconomic assumptions, which are summarized in Box 1, are consistent with the
medium-term macroeconomic framework described in the staff report. In addition, the
external debt numbers assume the full delivery of HIPC debt relief by all creditors,
100 percent debt reduction by France, Russia, Japan China, and completion of the
commercial debt buyback operation. Finally, the authorities are assumed to borrow
predominantly from the IDA and AfDF, resulting in an average grant element on new
borrowing of 41 percent. This assumption is based on the authorities’ medium-term
projections, which were informed by consultations with donors.11
III. EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
10.
Under the baseline scenario presented in Table 2, the debt indicators all remain
below their respective thresholds. The NPV of PPG external debt-to-GDP ratio is projected
to rise from 11.6 percent in 2007 to 16.1 percent by 2013, after which it slowly declines over
the remainder of the projection period to 9.9 percent by 2027. It thus remains well below the
country-specific threshold of 40 percent. The NPV of PPG debt-to-exports ratio increases
from 30.3 percent in 2007 to 63.3 percent by 2016—also far below the threshold of
150 percent—before falling back to about 44 percent again by 2027. The NPV of PPG debtto-revenue ratio increases to a peak of 94.5 percent in 2010, significantly below the threshold
of 250 percent. It then declines rapidly to 35.9 percent by 2027, driven in part by the assumed
increase in revenue collection.
11.
The debt service indicators also remain below their thresholds under the
baseline. As a result of the assumed full delivery of remaining HIPC debt relief in 2007, PPG
debt service falls in 2007. The PPG debt service-to-exports ratio, which has a threshold at
20 percent, falls from 2.5 percent in 2006 to 1.1 percent in 2007, peaking at 4.6 percent in
2021 and then gradually decreasing to 3.8 percent in 2027, always well below the threshold.
The ratio of PPG debt service to fiscal revenues falls from 6.6 percent in 2006, to 2.9 percent
in 2007, increasing slowly to 5.1 percent in 2011 and declining to 3.1 by 2027, well below
the 30-percent threshold (Table 2).
12.
External debt sustainability appears resilient to a number of shocks, although
the DSA shows that the debt service burden could rise significantly in the event of a
large increase in nonconcessional external commercial borrowing.12 As Table 3 shows,
11

Staffs have undertaken additional analysis that shows that the results of the DSA are not sensitive to a
lowering of the grant element. Stress Test A2 underscores this finding.

12

Both, last year’s DSA and this one, concluded that the risk of external debt distress for Mozambique is low,
even with the inclusion of the domestic debt, which was absent in the 2006 DSA. However, some of the
expected bilateral agreements envisaged in the 2006 DSA did not materialized but are expected to be concluded
during the course of this year. Regarding the assumptions for MDRI, the expected relief was greater than
previously estimated, which further improved the debt situation.

6

all the stress tests results show that debt sustainability indicators are well below the relevant
thresholds. However, stress test B7 shows that debt sustainability may be susceptible to a
significant increase in the amount of nonconcessional commercial debt in 2008. While still
remaining below the thresholds, the debt burden indicators rise sharply, and more than
double compared to the baseline (Table 3 and Figure 1). The alternative scenario of higher
concessional borrowing from 2008–15 also remains below the indicative thresholds but
almost doubles the NPV of debt to GDP by 2015.
IV. PUBLIC SECTOR DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
13.
Mozambique’s public debt (including domestic debt) is expected to decline over
the medium-to-long term under the baseline scenario (Table 2a and Figure 1a). As a
result of the gradual redemption of bonds issued to restructure the banking system and
predominant use of foreign exchange sales for sterilization purposes, public debt is projected
to decline from about 27 percent of GDP in 2007 to 30 percent in 2011, and to 14 percent by
2027 while the NPV of public sector debt-to GDP ratio is projected to fall from 19 percent in
2007 to 9 percent by 2027 (Table 2a). The nonrecourse to domestic financing over the
medium-term whilst only gradually increasing domestic financing of the fiscal deficit from
2012 onwards contributes to such a path for public debt. On the other hand, this projection
rests on the assumption that the revenue to GDP ratio increases and foreign aid gradually
falls as a percentage of GDP (Box 1), requiring only a modest increase in domestic debt
financing to maintain a roughly unchanged level of government expenditure.
14.
Public sector debt dynamics are driven by the external debt, given the low and
declining level of domestic debt (Table 1a). The large proportion of external debt makes the
public debt projection vulnerable to the same set of shocks as the external debt sustainability
assessment, albeit with some additional risks related to the sterilization needs to mop up
excess liquidity; which would increase in the event of lower revenues and/or higher
expenditures (even if financed by higher aid), and aid volatility and/or reluctance to sell
foreign exchange due to possible Dutch-Disease effects. The stress tests indicate that public
sector debt ratios are most vulnerable to a permanently lower GDP growth, which shows an
increasing path of public debt.

7

Box 1. Macroeconomic Assumptions 2007–27
The medium-term assumptions in the baseline scenario for 2007–27 are consistent with the
authorities’ medium-term macroeconomic framework described in the government’s Plano de Acção
para Redução da Pobreza Absoluta II (PARPA II).
Real GDP growth is projected to average 7.0 percent per year during 2007–10 and 6.5 percent
thereafter, representing a deceleration from its annual average of 8.6 percent during 2001–06. The
6.5–7.0 percent projection falls within the 5–8 percent range projected by the World Bank in its most
recent Country Economic Memorandum for Mozambique (Report No. 32615-MZ).
Consumer price inflation is projected to fall to 5 percent in the medium-to-long term, as oil prices
stabilize and inflation converges to levels closer to Mozambique’s main trading partner (South
Africa).
The real effective exchange rate is expected to remain broadly unchanged, in line with the relative
stability observed over the past decade.
Export growth is projected to accelerate slowly from 5.5 percent in the medium term to 6.1 percent
in the long term. This is driven to a large extent by traditional (nonmegaproject) exports that grow at
the rate of Mozambique’s trade partner import demand growth and megaproject exports that are
affected by world prices on aluminum and gas.
Import growth is projected to decelerate slowly from 6.6 percent in medium term to 6.3 percent in
the long-term. Import growth associated with megaprojects is assumed to equal the rate of
megaproject export growth, assuming that the import content of megaprojects remains roughly
constant on average. All other imports are assumed to grow at the rate of real GDP growth.
The noninterest current account deficit after grants is projected to expand slowly from 3.2 percent
of GDP during 2007–12 to 3.7 percent in 2013–2026, due to slightly higher import growth than
export growth.
Fiscal revenues are expected to rise from 14 percent in 2006 to 16 percent of GDP in 2010 reflecting
a 0.5 percent of GDP annual revenue effort on account of improved revenue administration and
broadening of the tax base. Beyond 2010, nontax revenues from natural resource exploitation
particularly megaprojects are expected to make a growing fiscal contribution. The tax to GDP ratio is
projected to reach about 22 percent in the long-term; the level estimated as Mozambique’s potential
tax ratio by a number of studies.13 Total expenditures remain roughly constant as a percent of GDP in
the long term, resulting in a domestic primary deficit ranging between 2–4 percent of GDP from
2007–27.
External grants to the government are projected to remain high at an average of 9 percent of GDP
during the medium term, which will help finance the “second wave of reforms” needed to sustain
broad-based growth and achieve the MDGs by 2015. No grant financing is assumed to come forward
from IDA. The share of program and project grants versus lending is assumed to fall over time:
grants are assumed to fall from approximately 8 percent of GDP in 2006 to around 2.3 percent of
GDP by 2027.

V. CONCLUSIONS
15.
In staffs’ view, Mozambique faces a low risk of debt distress. Mozambique’s
external debt levels are expected to remain well below their indicative thresholds for debt
distress both under the baseline and under various stress tests. Mozambique’s public debt is
expected to decline over the medium-to-long term under the baseline, while the stress tests
indicate that public sector debt ratios are most vulnerable to a permanently lower GDP
growth.
16.
A prudent new borrowing policy remains important. Where possible, the
authorities should continue to rely on concessional borrowing and grants to minimize future
debt service, and any nonconcessional financing of new projects ought to be considered case
by case based on economic return, impact on debt sustainability, and potential effects on the
financing decisions of donors and concessional lenders. Also, the authorities would still need
to closely monitor any substantial scaling-up of concessional external borrowing and the
issuance of domestic debt to sterilize the additional liquidity injected from increased
government spending.

Source: Staff projections and simulations.

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

The Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) provides 100 percent debt relief to eligible member countries that
are qualified for the assistance. The debt relief covers the full stock of debt owed to the Fund as of end-2004 which
remains outstanding at the time the member qualifies for such debt relief. The MDRI is financed by bilateral
contributions and the Fund's own resources, as well as the resources already disbursed to the member under the
HIPC Initiative (see Section VII above).

Safeguards assessment
Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, the Bank of Mozambique (BM) is subject to
safeguards assessment with respect to the PRGF Arrangement approved on July 6, 2004. The
assessment, which was completed on August 18, 2004, identified weaknesses in the areas of
financial reporting, internal audit, and the system of internal controls and proposed specific
measures to address weaknesses. The implementation of these measures is being monitored
by staff under the PRGF arrangement.
Exchange arrangements
Mozambique’s exchange system is a managed float. Commercial banks may buy and sell
foreign exchange to individual customers on a fully negotiable basis. The Bank of
Mozambique introduced a foreign exchange auction system in January 2005. Auctions are
held bi-weekly.
Mozambique still avails itself of the transitional arrangements under Article XIV of the Fund
Articles of Agreement, but has eliminated all Article XIV restrictions. It maintains, however,
restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions
subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, as evidenced by (i) the discretionary prior
approval for remittances of family living expenses; (ii) the authorization for the purchase of
foreign exchange in excess of US$5,000 for certain transactions; (iii) the prohibition for the
conversion of balances of nonresidents’ domestic currency accounts into foreign currency or
transfer abroad; (iv) the prohibition on advance payments for a service; and (v) the
prohibition on advance payments for the import of goods. At the authorities’ request, an
Article VIII mission was conducted by LEG and PDR in March 2004. The mission
encouraged the authorities to remove all existing the exchange restrictions. A new foreign
exchange law was submitted to the Assembly in April 2007. Following approval of the new
law and issuance of related regulations, the authorities intend to accept their obligations
under Article VIII sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement.
Article IV consultation
In accordance with Decision No 12794–(02/76), as amended by Decision No 12854–(02/96),
Mozambique is on a 24-month Article IV cycle due to the approval of a new PRGF
arrangement in July 2004. The 2005 Article IV consultation was completed by the Executive
Board on June 22, 2005 (Country Report No. 05/318).
In concluding the 2005 Article IV consultation, Executive Directors welcomed the
substantial reduction in poverty realized over the past decade. At the same time, they stressed
that stepped-up efforts are needed to further reduce poverty and, with the necessary financial
assistance of the international community, reach the Millennium Development Goals. In

5
particular, they looked forward to the new poverty reduction strategy paper for 2006–10.
They noted, however, that a second wave of reforms is needed to deepen and accelerate
structural changes to sustain high and broad-based growth. Directors emphasized that efforts
should aim at (i) increasing tax revenues; (ii) strengthening public sector operations;
(iii) reducing the costs of doing business; (iv) promoting labor intensive sectors; and
(v) implementing a rural development strategy.
Ex Post Assessment of performance under Fund-Supported Programs
An ex post assessment (EPA) of Mozambique’s performance under Fund-Supported
Programs since 1987 was undertaken in December 2003 under the guidelines on assessments
of countries with a longer-term program engagement. The EPA was circulated to the
Executive Board on November 21, 2003 (Country Report No. 04/53).
Directors commended the authorities for their pursuit of sound macroeconomic policies and
wide ranging structural reforms over the past fifteen years which contributed to strong
growth of the economy, and a steady decline in poverty rates. Noting that despite
considerable progress Mozambique remains a very poor and vulnerable country, Directors
urged the authorities to persevere in their efforts to consolidate macroeconomic stability and
accelerate and deepen structural reforms with a view to sustaining economic growth,
encouraging employment creation, and further reducing poverty.
FSAP participation and ROSCs
A Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) for Mozambique was undertaken during the
first quarter of 2003. The related Financial Sector Stability Assessment was circulated to the
Executive Board on November 19, 2003 (Country Report No. 04/52). A ROSC on fiscal
transparency was issued on February 22, 2001. This ROSC was updated in the context of
the 2002 Article IV consultation (Country Report No. 02/140) and the 2003 Article IV
consultation (Country Report No. 04/50). A Report on the Observance of Standards and
Codes (ROSC) data module was prepared in June 2002 and issued on March 5, 2003. This
data module was updated in August 2005.
Management’s visit
At the invitation of the authorities, Mr. Kato, Deputy Managing Director, visited Maputo,
Mozambique in July 2005.

Mozambique: Relations with the World Bank Group
(As of May 7, 2007)
Partnership in Mozambique’s development strategy
1.
The Mozambican government’s development strategy is set forth in its second
generation poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP), termed the PARPA-II (Plano de Acção
para a Redução da Pobreza Absoluta, or Action Plan for the Reduction of Absolute Poverty),
which was approved in May 2006 by the council of ministers and endorsed by the Boards of
the Fund and the Bank in December 2006, when they discussed a Joint Staff Advisory Note
of PARPA II. The Fund and the World Bank will continue to cooperate closely, within their
respective mandates, in assisting the government to implement its medium-term poverty
reduction and growth strategy and the related reform agenda, as presented in the PARPA-II
and updated in the annual progress report and PAF.
2.
The Fund will continue to lead the policy dialogue on macroeconomic policy,
(including fiscal, monetary, and exchange rate policies), the integrated financial management
information system (SISTAFE), and tax and customs reforms. The Bank will continue to lead
the policy dialogue on public expenditure management, sectoral structural reforms, the
reform of the civil service, and the Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA). Areas of
close collaboration include banking supervision and financial sector issues, trade issues, the
PARPA and its further development, and external debt sustainability.
Bank group country assistance strategy
3.
The current CAS (FY04–07) is a Results-based strategy, prepared jointly with IFC
and MIGA. Preparation of a new Country Partnership Strategy jointly with four donors has
started in support of the agenda of the Paris Declaration on Harmonization. The Bank is
coordinating with partners through a peer review process and harmonization of analysis and
results frameworks. The three pillars of the current CAS are (i) improving the investment
climate, (ii) expanding service delivery, and (iii) building capacity and accountability. A
CAS Progress Report, an evaluation of the Bank’s program during the first two years of
implementation has been completed and presented to the Board in March 2006. The focus of
the Bank’s lending program is on programmatic support through four rolling Poverty
Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs), of which the first two credits have been approved and
fully disbursed. Fiduciary issues are fully taken into account within the scope and sequencing
of the PRSCs. The shift to programmatic lending through the PRSCs was underpinned by the
Bank’s core diagnostic economic and sector work, including the public expenditure review
and PSIA. While a series of PRSCs is the largest single element in the lending program, the
shift from traditional investment lending to program lending is being phased in gradually.
Selected investment projects are targeting institutional strengthening, capacity building,
transport infrastructure, water, agriculture, and communications. The new Country
Partnership Strategy for Mozambique (FY08—11) will be discussed by the Board on
May 22, 2007.

10
4.
To date, the World Bank Group has approved 7 adjustment operations, 3 development
policy operations, one investment guarantee and 48 investment operations totaling
approximately US$3.2 billion. The CAS financing plan for FY04–07 included lending
financing, grant resources and guarantee coverage for US$560 million, of which
$538 million (US$288 in investment operations and US$250 million in three Poverty
Reductions Support Program credits) and US$30 million in an IBRD guarantee have been
approved. One additional investment operation is scheduled to be delivered before the end of
the CAS period. The graph below illustrates the distribution of the current portfolio by main
sectors.

5.
The World Bank has been actively supporting the government of Mozambique’s
macroeconomic program since 1986 through a series of structural adjustment operations.
The last, the Economic Management and Private Sector Operation (EMPSO), was approved
by the Bank Board in August 2002 for US$120 million. The EMPSO supported the
government’s program of consolidating macroeconomic stability and laying the foundations
for sustained private sector-led growth over the medium term. It included measures to make
the budget more transparent (including accounting for external aid flows), conduct a public
expenditure review, strengthen the financial sector while aiming to eliminate government
ownership in the sector, and liberalize the telecommunications and air transport sectors in
order to facilitate further private participation. Since 2004, the Bank’s quick-disbursing
assistance has taken the form of development policy lending through PRSCs, which have
been developed in tandem with the Joint Review/Performance Assessment Framework.
Three PRSCs have been presented to the Board so far (in July 2004, September 2005, and
January 2007), valued at US$60 million, US$120 million, and US70 million respectively.
The third PRSC credit is the first operation to support the PARPAII.
6.
The World Bank has been an active partner in supporting the government in
improving education and strengthening capacity building in key public institutions. The
Education Sector Strategic Program (US$71 million—FY99, closed in December 31, 2007)
supported the implementation of the National Education Strategy, whose objectives are the

11
promotion of sustained improvements in the quality of Mozambique’s labor force, and
greater gender and regional equity in economic opportunities. The Higher Education Project
(US$60 million—FY02) supports the entire higher education system, including both public
and private institutions of higher education. The Technical and Vocational Education and
Training project (US$30 million —FY06) is the first operation in the tertiary and vocational
education area.
7.
In health, the Health Sector Recovery Project (US$98.7 million—FY96, closed
in 2003) supported the government’s broad Health Sector Recovery Program, especially by
reducing infant and child mortality. The HIV/AIDS Project (US$55 million—FY03) assists
the government in carrying out its National Strategic Plan to Combat STDs and HIV/AIDS.
The HIV/AIDS Treatment Acceleration Project (US$21 million―FY04) assists the
Government in scaling up ongoing HIV/AIDS treatment initiatives using a combination of
public/private/NGO partnerships to serve vulnerable groups. A new health operation is under
preparation for FY08.
8.
In the area of transport and infrastructure, the Bank has three active projects. The
Railways and Ports Restructuring Project (US$100 million—FY00) aims at increasing the
operating efficiency of the three major port-rail systems in Mozambique. The Roads and
Bridges Project (US$162 million—FY02) aims at improving road infrastructure, sector
policies, and management, and the Beira Railway Project (US$110 million―FY05) aims to
improve the cost-effectiveness and efficiency for freight and passenger rail transport in the
Zambezi Valley and beyond. The second phase of the Roads and Bridges project
(US$100 million) will be presented to the Board on May 22, 2007.
9.
In the water sector, one project—the National Water Development Project I
(NWDP I) (US$36 million—FY98)—closed on October 31, 2006, the National Water
Development Project II (NWDP II) (US$75 million plus US$15 supplemental—FY99,
FY04)—support improvements in service delivery standards, coverage, water resources
management, and management capacity in both rural and urban areas. The NWDP II also
supports private sector management of water services in five major cities.
10.
Another important part of the Bank’s portfolio focuses on strengthening the
investment climate and encouraging private sector participation. The current Bank CAS has
been prepared jointly with the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Multilateral
Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA). IDA recently closed the Enterprise Development
Project (US$26 million—FY00,) which aimed at broadening the base of private participation
in the Mozambican economy. The Mineral Resource Management Capacity Building Project
(US$18 million—FY01) seeks to increase institutional capacity in the sector, and alleviate
poverty. The Communications Sector Reform Project (US$14.9 million—FY02) seeks to
increase private sector participation in the postal, air transport, and telecommunications
sectors.
As regards public sector reform, the Public Sector Project (US25.6 million―FY03)
11.
seeks to upgrade the quality of public services, reduce red tape, and improve access to public
services. The Municipal Development Project (US$33.6 million―FY01, closed in
February 2007) aimed to strengthen the institutional capacity of municipal government and

12
pilot a municipal grant mechanism to finance investment. The Maputo Municipal
Development Program (US$30 million, FY07) aims to strengthen the capacity of the Maputo
City Council to develop, manage and maintain quality service delivery to its citizens. Finally,
the Decentralized Planning Financing Project (US$42 million―FY04) supports
improvements to the institutional capacity of district administrations. The Financial Sector
Technical Assistance project (US$10.5 million—FY06) supports implementation of the
recommendations of the Financial Sector Assessment Program jointly conducted with the
Fund in 2003.
12.
The Bank is also involved in agriculture, energy, and the environment. The
Agricultural Sector Public Expenditure Program (US$30 million—FY99, closed in
December 2006)), was a sectorwide assistance program (SWAP) that sought to improve the
impact of public expenditure in developing an enabling environment for sustainable and
equitable growth in the rural sector. The Gas Engineering Project (US$26 million—FY94),
which closed in 2003, supported pre-investment in the Pande-Gas Project and provided
capacity building to the government for negotiation of megaprojects. This operation
supported capacity and technical assistance for negotiation and implementation of the
Southern Africa Gas project, a pipeline financed by SASOL of South Africa with equity
participation of IFC and guarantee coverage of MIGA (US$30 million—FY04. The Energy
Reform and Access Project (US$40.2 million—FY04), which supports reform of the power
sector, in particular the separation of distribution, transmission, and generation functions,
aims at increasing the number of electricity connections, solar energy distributors, and seeks
to provide a more efficient service. The World Bank Group is also supporting sustainable use
of natural resources with two operations in environment: the Coastal and Marine Biodiversity
Management Project (US$9.7 million—FY00), which pilots an integrated approach to
achieving sustainable development, focusing on two main coastal areas, and the second credit
of a Transfrontier Conservation Areas and Tourism project (US$20 million plus
US$10 million in a Global Environment Facility grant—FY06). A Market-led Smallholder
Development project of US$30 million was approved in FY06.
13.
The Bank’s program also encompasses economic and sector work to support the
three pillars of the CAS, involving work on the following:
•

Improving the Investment Climate. Economic and sector work completed over the past
two fiscal years included a strategy for rural growth and income creation and a country
economic memorandum on sustainable growth and poverty reduction, which also
analyzed the sources of growth. Technical assistance is currently being provided in
procurement reform, mining and on commercial debt reduction. A PSIA on labor market
and a PSIA on land are planned for preparation in FY06–07, together with a study on
regional growth poles.

•

Expanding Service Delivery. Work completed has involved a country status report on
health; a technical assistance on health budget management; a report on the status of the
health Millennium Development Goals; a Poverty and Social Impact Assessment (PSIA)
on primary school fees; an assessment on labor markets and technical education; a study
on private sector competitiveness; a study on local service delivery; and a report on water

13
resource management. Ongoing and planned studies include a poverty assessment, a rural
strategy, a country environmental and social assessment.
•

Building Capacity and Accountability Investing in People. Work completed includes a
country procurement assessment report, a legal and judicial assessment, an institutional
governance review including a survey on corruption, a public expenditure review and
ongoing technical assistance on public expenditure management.

•

Monitoring and Evaluation. The Bank provided technical assistance to the Government to
finalize and monitor its first PRSP M&E system, the Strategic Matrix of PARPAII. The
Bank is currently supporting the preparation of a Monitoring Plan to implement the
Strategic Matrix.

IMF-World Bank collaboration in specific areas
14.
Fund and Bank staff maintain a close working relationship, with the lead taken by one
or both institutions, especially with respect to (i) analyses and reforms in public expenditure
management; (ii) the PARPA and accompanying annual updates and joint staff advisory
notes; (iii) the financial sector and banking supervision; (iv) PSIA; (v) tax issues; (vi) trade
issues; and (vii) external debt sustainability analysis:
•

Public expenditure management. The Fund and the Bank jointly emphasize the urgent
need to further improve public expenditure management, accountability, and
transparency. The two institutions support policy reforms in the areas of budget
formulation, execution, and monitoring. The IMF assists the authorities in introducing the
integrated financial management information system (SISTAFE), and several donors,
including the World Bank, provide financial support and policy advice for this reform.
Under the Fund’s leadership, a group of 10 donors set up a common fund for this large
undertaking. The Bank’s PRSC emphasizes budget comprehensiveness and budget
execution reporting.

•

Poverty reduction strategy paper. The Fund and Bank worked together with the
government during 1999–2001, while the PARPA was being produced, and drafted the
joint staff review, which was presented to the Board in September 2001. The government
issued annual progress reports in 2003, 2004 and 2005 and the staff presented their joint
staff assessments to their respective Boards. The Bank and the Fund worked again with
the government during the preparation of PARPA II and elaborated the Joint Staff
Advisory Note in 2006.

•

The Fund and the Bank are finalizing preparation of a JSAN on the Government’s revised
PARPA, officially approved at the end of September 2006. The PARPAII incorporates a
Strategic Matrix which is the basis for the M&E system.

14
•

Financial sector. The Fund and the Bank have worked together on the financial sector.
The banking sector in Mozambique has repeatedly shown weaknesses in the past,
requiring recapitalizations and intervention. Following the FSAP conducted in
Mozambique during the first semester of 2003, the Fund and the Bank continue to advise
the authorities on strengthening financial supervision and accounting standards to prevent
the recurrence of such problems in the future. The Financial Sector Technical Assistance
Project was approved in FY06.

•

PSIA. As part of the ongoing Bank budget support and the programs supported by the
IMF, the Fund and the Bank have agreed to review closely the poverty and social impact
of the key reforms that are being implemented. A pilot PSIA, advising the government on
the impact of an increase in specific fuel taxes, was undertaken in 2002. A second PSIA,
on the impact of reducing primary schooling fees, was completed in October 2004. A
third PSIA in FY07 analyzed the likely impact of the proposed new Labor Law. A PSIA
following up on the previous study on the elimination of primary schooling fees will be
finalized in FY08.

•

Taxes. The Fund has taken the lead in this area. The government issued a new income tax
law in 2002 and a revised code of fiscal incentives for investors. The Bank has been
supportive of the policies proposed. Further reforms to strengthen tax revenues and to
improve the efficiency of tax administration are part of Mozambique’s regular dialogue
with the Fund.

•

Trade. The Fund and the Bank have worked together since the early 1990s on trade
issues concerning general reductions in tariffs, the variable tariff on sugar introduced
in 1999, and the reduction in the export tariff on raw cashews. The Fund and the Bank are
involved in reforming the customs administration in Mozambique. The Bank is
cooperating with the donors (particularly USAID) and the government in executing the
studies on trade policy required for the Integrated Framework.

•

External sustainability analysis (DSA). The Bank and the Fund work jointly in
preparing an annual DSA, in consultation with the authorities. The latest DSA was
finalized in May 2007.

15.
In 2007 and 2008, disbursements under World Bank investment projects are expected
to reach around US$184 million on average a year.

Mozambique: Statistical Issues
Data provision to the Fund for surveillance purposes is adequate, but the overall
quality of macroeconomic statistics still hinders policy formulation and monitoring of
economic development. Moreover, despite the increase in budget resources allocated to the
compilation of official statistics, continued high reliance on external funding raises concerns
about the sustainability of the programs of the National Institute of Statistics (INE).
1.

In May 2005, an STA mission updated the data module of the Report on the
Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) prepared in June 2002. The mission noted that
significant effort has been made to address the shortcomings identified by the 2002 ROSC
mission, a clear indication of the increased awareness of the importance of compiling and
disseminating statistics that follow international standards and good practices. The
improvements in the institutional environment and the increased allocation of resources for
the compilation of national accounts, balance of payments, and more recently, government
finance statistics should help to address weaknesses in the prerequisites for the quality of the
statistics. The methodological soundness, accuracy, and reliability of the macroeconomic
statistics are starting to show improvements as a result of these actions.

2.

3.
The authorities are committed to adhering to internationally accepted standards and
good practices, as demonstrated by their participation in the IMF’s General Data
Dissemination System (GDDS) since November 2003. GDDS metadata are posted on the
IMF’s Data Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB) website, and on the INE’s website. In
August 2004, the INE’s webpage was replaced by a portal with search capabilities to
improve the accessibility of available data and metadata.
National accounts
4.
The national accounts are prepared by the INE in accordance with the 1993 System of
National Accounts (1993 SNA). The INE compiles and disseminates (i) annual GDP at
current and constant (1996) prices by activity; (ii) annual GDP by expenditure items at
current and constant prices; and (iii) annual value added components at current prices by
activity. Work is under way to compile the new benchmark year (2000) with new and
improved data sources and methodology. The INE has launched a new household income and
expenditure survey and new economic censuses leading to a new business registry.
Furthermore, the INE is compiling more comprehensive and timely foreign trade data based
on improved classification systems. The new national accounts framework will also include
compilation of quarterly estimates expected to be disseminated shortly.
Prices and labor market
5.
A new consumer price index for Maputo based on weights derived from the 2002–03
household survey was released in February 2006. The previous series, available since 1998,
was widely criticized for narrowly focusing on a few basic food staples with relatively
volatile prices and, therefore, exhibiting large swings. A national index obtained by

18
integrating the indices for Maputo, Beira, and Nampula was released in April 2006. The IMF
has provided technical assistance in price statistics in the context of the GDDS Regional
Project for Lusophone African Countries. The last technical assistant mission (June 11–
July 21, 2006) under the GDDS project found important advances regarding the use of the
COICOP classification and the strengthening of human resources in the compilation of the
new CPI. Several issues remain outstanding, however, such as price collection procedures
not fully consolidate at the provincial level, imputation methods, and possible inconsistencies
in the overlapping period between the new and old series.
6.
There are insufficient sectoral labor market and employment data, and where
available, they have limited coverage. A one-year labor market survey of the entire country,
undertaken by INE in collaboration with the Labor Ministry, was launched in October 2004.
Monetary statistics
7.
An STA mission in September 2004 prepared a work plan for the implementation of
the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM) and the development of an integrated
monetary database (IMD) to meet the needs of the Bank of Mozambique (BM), AFR, and
STA. The mission noted progress in the information system and in the periodicity and
timeliness of the data compiled. The mission found that the Bank of Mozambique’s chart of
accounts was inadequate to compile monetary statistics fully aligned with the MFSM with
regard to the sectorization of the institutional units and the breakdown between local and
foreign-currency-denominated accounts. The mission recommended improving the
classification and valuation of some financial instruments, and estimating the full instrument
and sectoral breakdown based on available information. The mission also recommended
expanding the coverage of the survey on other depository corporations by including the
credit cooperatives, in the medium term.
8.
Mozambique is already using the new standardized forms (SRFs) for reporting
monetary data to STA. As a result, five-year historical enhanced data are being published in
the IFS Supplement, first issued in September 2006. The IMD consistent with the SRFs is in
the process of becoming fully operational, which will allow the derivation of accurate and
timely monthly monetary statistics that meet the needs of STA, AFR, and the authorities,
while reducing BM’s reporting burden.
External sector statistics
9.
With assistance from STA, the BM has made significant progress toward compiling
and disseminating balance-of-payments (BOP) and international investment position (IIP)
statistics that are fully aligned with the Balance of Payments Manual, fifth edition (BPM5).
This assistance is also being provided in the context of the GDDS regional project.
10.
The BM has an adequate institutional framework for the compilation of BOP and IIP
statistics, and has implemented many of the recommendations made by the four technical
assistance missions conducted since mid-2003. However, in order for the work on institution
building to be consolidated, the Foreign Exchange Law has to be approved (incorporating the
definition of residency in alignment with he BPM5 methodology), training on BOP statistics

19
has to be sustained, and the project to computerize the balance of payments compilation
system has to be completed. The major improvements in the basic sources of data from the
beginning of the project comprise (i) the distribution of the new BOP surveys to more than
35 enterprises, including the megaprojects; (ii) program improvements by Customs to ensure
the quality of external trade data; (iii) improvements in the reports on foreign investment and
private loans prepared by the BM; (iv) improvements in the reports on the external public
debt provided by the Ministry of Finance; and (v) improvements in the banks’ reports on
foreign currency transactions.
11.
Other important concerns include (i) the coverage and quality of the data obtained in
the enterprise surveys, such as data from the other SASOL1 projects; (ii) the quality of
external trade data, especially with regard to price and volume indices; (iii) the coverage,
time of recording, and classification of the data on foreign investment and private loans;
(iv) completeness of data for the Reserves Template and their reconciliation with the reserve
component of the balance of payments; and (v) compiling the IIP using the sources that are
used for the balance of payments compilation.
12.
The BM has started to compile partial IIP data, which were published in the 2005
Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook.
Government finance statistics
13.
In recent years, technical assistance has been provided under the GDDS Project for
Lusophone countries. The July 2005 mission found that while the authorities have made
significant efforts to improve fiscal data, serious weaknesses remain.
14.
The creation of a statistical unit in the MOF and the launching of the Integrated
Management and Financial Information System (SISTAFE) will contribute to enhance the
analytical usefulness of government finance statistics in the near future. However, the
mission found that the budget system, while broadly aligned to the GFSM 1986 analytical
framework, is inadequate to compile GFS. In particular, further work is needed to improve
institutional and transactional coverage.
15.
Mozambique does not report fiscal data for publication in the IFS or the Government
Finance Statistic Yearbook (GFSY).

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with
Mozambique
On June 18, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Mozambique.25
Background
The Mozambican economy has continued to perform well in recent years and is
increasingly resilient to exogenous shocks. Real GDP growth has picked up in 2006 led
by a recovery in agricultural production and construction activities while the trade
balance improved due to a surge in exports. Headline inflation has fallen to single digit
levels anchored by a prudent monetary stance. The outlook for 2007 is for continued
strong growth, inflation in the range of 5-7 percent, and a sustainable fiscal and external
position, with some risks related to a further rise in oil prices.
Policy challenges remain, however, in sustaining Mozambique’s growth takeoff and
achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The stabilization effort and a firstwave of reforms helped sustain a growth of 8 percent a year, on average, since the
early 1990s. Broad-based growth and foreign aid, including debt relief, helped reduce
poverty and improve social indicators. The experience of countries that have kept
growth accelerating over the long run suggests a need to consolidate macroeconomic

25

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions
with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and
financial information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and
policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for
discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing
Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this
summary is transmitted to the country's authorities.

2
stability and implement second-generation reforms, including a scaling-up of basic
services to address human capital and infrastructure gaps.
The arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) helped
maintain macroeconomic stability in the face of exogenous shocks and addressed the
structural weaknesses identified in the Ex Post Assessment (EPA, IMF/04/53). Overall
performance under the program has been good, which has helped the authorities
maintain inflation control and a comfortable level of international reserves in the face of
exogenous shocks. The authorities also completed reforms identified in the EPA—
particularly in strengthening revenue mobilization by creating a central revenue authority
(ATM), improving expenditure efficiency through the rollout of a government financial
management information system (e-SISTAFE), and addressing vulnerabilities in the
financial system.
The three-year Policy Support Instrument (2007–10) is focused on consolidating
macroeconomic stability to sustain Mozambique’s growth takeoff in the context of
scaled-up foreign aid. Fiscal policy will be reinforced to finance additional priority
spending in a sustainable manner and ensure that a scaling-up of aid-financed
expenditures reaches the most productive and pro-poor sectors. Monetary control will
anchor inflationary expectations while a flexible exchange rate regime will help maintain
competitiveness and a comfortable level of international reserves to cushion against
exogenous shocks. The structural program aims at improving the business environment
by deepening the financial system and reducing the cost of doing business, as well as
strengthening the fiscal and transparency regime of the natural resource sector.
Institutional and capacity building need to keep pace with the rapid structural
transformation of the economy and facilitate the implementation of second-generation
reforms.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal. Directors commended
the Mozambican authorities on the impressive macroeconomic performance and overall
satisfactory program performance since the last Article IV consultation. They noted that
the economy has been resilient to numerous exogenous shocks, and the outlook is for
continued strong growth, moderate inflation, and a sustainable fiscal and external
position. Progress has also been made in reducing poverty.
Directors agreed that there are policy challenges related to sustaining Mozambique’s
growth takeoff and to achieving the MDGs. The strategy to consolidate macroeconomic
stability in the context of a continued scaling-up of foreign aid and the acceleration of a
second wave of reforms outlined in the authorities’ poverty reduction plan (PARPA II) for
2006–09, to be monitored under the new Policy Support Instrument arrangement,
should help sustain strong broad-based growth.
Directors noted that consolidating macroeconomic stability would require persevering
with sound fiscal and monetary policies, as well as prudent public debt management
and public finance reforms. In this regard, the medium-term fiscal framework will need to
continue to target an annual 0.5 percent GDP revenue increase and no recourse to

3
financing from the domestic financial system. This should help contain inflation and
allow private sector credit to expand further and decrease its cost, while maintaining
competitiveness and debt sustainability and reducing aid dependency.
Directors agreed that the 2007 budget was appropriate as it targeted a 0.5 percent of
GDP rise in domestic revenue with the share of priority expenditures exceeding
65 percent of total spending. The rollout of the public financial administration system (eSISTAFE) to all public entities at the central and provincial level, and direct execution of
a greater share of current spending should improve monitoring of expenditures. The
finalization of guidelines to include donor-funded projects in the single treasury account
(CUT) and e-SISTAFE as well as the opening of a multicurrency CUT should be
expedited to encourage the donors to transfer projects on CUT.
Directors noted that the public sector reform program is at a critical juncture. They
looked forward to the installation of a clean integrated payroll database based on a civil
service census and the piloting of program budgeting. The government’s
decentralization strategy should be clarified and well sequenced with sufficient capacity
building and reporting systems to ensure accountability of budgetary resources. This
would help address concerns about the accountability and transparency of district
spending. Directors looked forward to visible results of the anti-corruption strategy and
judicial sector reform.
Directors supported the Bank of Mozambique’s policy framework of base money
targeting, in conjunction with a flexible exchange rate regime. They welcomed the
abolition of the exchange rate band, which demonstrates the commitment of the
authorities to a flexible exchange rate regime, and which should help cushion against
exogenous shocks and improve competitiveness.
Directors emphasized that second-generation institutional reforms are critical to sustain
economic growth. A private sector led growth strategy calls for a strengthening of the
business environment, particularly a deepening of the financial sector while
strengthening the supervisory framework. Directors welcomed the approval of the new
mining and petroleum fiscal laws, and looked forward to the timely adoption of their
implementing regulations. They also encouraged the adoption of new model contracts in
the mining and petroleum sectors while ensuring that all new sizable projects abide by
the principles of the new fiscal regime and the core principles of the Extractive Industries
Transparency Initiative.
Directors welcomed the good progress made in seeking financing for the transfer of
majority ownership of the Cahora Bassa hydropower plant from Portugal to
Mozambique. They noted the authorities’ renewed commitment to non-recourse
financing so as not to increase the government’s liabilities to commercial creditors, and
ensure transparency and accountability. These principles could be applied to all future
infrastructure projects, while encouraging greater private participation to reduce risks to
debt sustainability.
Directors emphasized that the timely implementation of the strategic action plan to
reduce the cost of doing business will be key to promote export diversification and

4
generate employment. In this regard, high fees charged for scanning freight is a
concern, as they increase export/import transaction costs.
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation with Mozambique will be held within
24 months, subject to the provisions of the Executive Board decision on consultation
cycles in program countries.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
June 18, 2007

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Completes Final Review of the PRGF Arrangement for
Mozambique, Approves US$2.4 Million Disbursement and Approves a Three-Year
Policy Support Instrument
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the sixth
and final review of Mozambique’s economic performance under an SDR 11.36 million
(about US$17.1 million) Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement (see
Press Release No. 04/153). The completion of this final review enables the release of an
amount equivalent to SDR 1.64 million (about US$2.4 million).
The Executive Board has also completed a review of the country's financing assurances and
granted Mozambique's request for a waiver for the non-observance of a performance criterion
on base money at end-year 2006, as it was temporary and related to the currency reform.
The Executive Board also approved a Policy Support Instrument (PSI) for Mozambique
under the IMF's PSI framework, which is intended to support the nation's economic reform
efforts. The PSI for Mozambique is aimed at maintaining macroeconomic stability as foreign
aid is scaled up, promoting structural reforms, as well as implementing the broader policy
agenda as envisaged in the Mozambican authorities' national poverty reduction strategy,
Plano de Acção para Redução da Pobreza Absoluta (PARPA II). Approval of Mozambique's
PSI signifies IMF endorsement of the policies outlined in the program.
The IMF's framework for PSIs is designed for low-income countries that may not need, or
want, IMF financial assistance, but still seek IMF advice, monitoring, and endorsement of
their policies. PSIs are voluntary and demand driven. PSI-supported programs are based on
country-owned poverty reduction strategies adopted in a participatory process involving civil
society and development partners and articulated in a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
(PRSP). This is intended to ensure that PSI-supported programs are consistent with a
comprehensive framework for macroeconomic, structural and social policies to foster growth
and reduce poverty. Members' performance under a PSI is normally reviewed semi-annually,
irrespective of the status of the program (see Public Information Notice No. 05/145).
The Executive Board also concluded the 2007 Article IV consultation with Mozambique.

In commenting on the Executive Board decisions, Mr. Takatoshi Kato, Deputy Managing
Director and Acting Chair, stated:
“The Mozambican authorities are to be commended on the recent impressive macroeconomic
performance and overall satisfactory program performance. The economy has been resilient
to numerous exogenous shocks and the outlook for 2007 and medium-term is favorable. The
authorities’ graduation to a PSI sends a strong signal to donors and private investors
regarding the favorable economic environment.
“The strategy to consolidate macroeconomic stability in the context of a continued scaling-up
of aid and the acceleration of a second wave of reforms monitored under the three-year PSI
should help sustain strong broad-based growth. This strategy would require a strengthening
of fiscal policy and reducing the cost of doing business and continuing to squarely address
governance issues. The approval of the new mining and petroleum fiscal laws, and intention
to issue implementing regulations is welcome in this regard. The authorities are also
encouraged to adopt new model contracts in the mining and petroleum sectors while ensuring
that all new sizeable projects abide by the principles of the new fiscal regime and the core
principles of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative.
“The 2007 budget should continue to target a 0.5 percent of GDP rise in domestic revenue,
while the share of priority expenditures exceeds 65 percent of total spending. The rollout of
e-SISTAFE (public financial administration system) to all public entities at the central and
provincial level, and direct execution of a greater share of current spending should improve
monitoring of expenditures. The finalization of guidelines to include donor-funded projects
in the single treasury account (CUT) and e-SISTAFE as well as the opening of a
multicurrency CUT should be expedited to encourage the donors to transfer projects on CUT.
“The public sector reform program is at a critical juncture. The installation of a clean
integrated payroll database based on a civil service census is an important first step. The
government’s decentralization strategy should be clarified and well sequenced with sufficient
capacity building and reporting systems to ensure accountability of budgetary resources. This
would help address concerns about the accountability and transparency of district spending.
Progress in the anti-corruption strategy and judicial sector reform will be crucial to further
strengthen the business climate.
“Good progress has been made in seeking financing for the transfer of majority ownership of
the Cahora Bassa hydropower plant from Portugal to Mozambique. The authorities reiterated
their commitment to non-recourse financing so not to increase the government’s liabilities to
commercial creditors, and ensure transparency and accountability. These principles could be
applied to all future infrastructure projects whilst encouraging greater private participation to
reduce risks to debt sustainability.
“The Bank of Mozambique’s policy framework of base money targeting, in conjunction with
a flexible exchange rate regime, is appropriate. Greater exchange rate flexibility will help

3

cushion against exogenous shocks and improve competitiveness, and in that regard the
elimination of the temporary exchange rate band is a welcome step,” Mr. Kato said.

Statement by Peter Gakunu, Executive Director for Republic of Mozambique
and Jose Alves Sulemane, Advisor to Executive Director
June 18, 2007
The Mozambican authorities wish to acknowledge the Fund’s engagement, support, and
constructive dialogue and thank staff for the well written reports which clearly identify the
challenges for its development process, as well as the various policy options facing the
country in the medium to long term. They are in broad agreement with the thrust of the
analyses, conclusions, and recommendations in the report.
Recent Macroeconomic Developments and Performance
Since the end of the civil war in 1992, growth has been strong in Mozambique, and has
contributed to the reduction of the poverty. It was in line with this trend that real GDP growth
accelerated from 6.2 percent in 2005 to an estimated 8.5 percent in 2006, propelled by a
rebound in agricultural production and the continued strength of the construction sector.
Implementation of prudent fiscal and monetary policies helped maintain inflation at a single
digit at the end of 2006. Annual inflation declined from 11.2 percent at the end of 2005 to
9.4 percent at the end-December 2006, and reduced further to 8.3 percent in May 2007,
despite the effects of high oil prices. Increased exports as well as sustained inflow of foreign
aid kept net international reserves at over four months of imports cover, resulting in the
foreign exchange market remaining stable during the year.
The authorities’ fiscal policy stance was better than programmed as revenue collection was
above target, with expenditure directed to priority areas, especially for poverty reduction, in
line with the 65 percent target in the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PARPA). Progress
has been made in reforming the revenue administration and widening the tax base, while the
new Central Revenue Authority (ATM) is now fully operational. In addition, during 2006,
the number of taxpayers increased by more than 30 percent; while other measures undertaken
contributed increased revenue collection.
In the area of tax policy, the Cabinet approved and submitted to the Parliament three laws on
specific taxes and fiscal incentives in the mineral resources and petroleum sectors in
December 2006. A new fiscal code for succession and donations, and a draft municipal
finance and asset law were also submitted to the Parliament. The latter aligns the finance and
asset management of the municipalities with the new financial and fiscal systems
implemented over the last six years. Progress continues in Public Financial Management
(PFM) reforms to improve budget preparation and monitoring at the central level, and on
strengthening the planning capacity at sub-national institutions. At the end of April 2007, the
Census of the civil service was completed that would help improve the planning of the wage
bill. In order to improve coverage in the execution of the budget, guidelines were also issued
to facilitate the inclusion of donor-financed projects on the Single Treasury Account (CUT).
The reforms in this area have contributed to increased confidence on domestic mechanisms
for aid delivery, and as at end April 2007, 19 donors are committed to giving general budget
support to Mozambique under a specific memorandum of understanding.

2
The authorities pursued a prudent monetary policy stance in 2006, resulting in a smooth
introduction of the new family of meticais (MTn). The financial system has continued to
improve. In this regard, prudential ratios of the banking system remained sound and the ratio
of non-performing loans to total loans was below 4 percent; commercial banks are highly
profitable with their levels of capital adequacy being closely monitored in light of the overall
strong growth in credit to the economy; and foreign currency loans in total loans have
decreased from almost 64 percent in 2005 to 45 percent in 2006. In the process of increasing
transparency and modernization, the Central Bank (BM) has adjusted its Chart of Accounts
to allow for the valuation of foreign exchange gains/losses consistent with International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), and its financial statements for 2006 have been issued
in compliance with IFRS and in parallel with the financial statement prepared under the
current accounting standard.
Progress on implementation of structural reforms accelerated, particularly in the areas of the
public sector, cost of doing business, and governance reforms. First, the second phase of the
public sector reform strategic action plan (2006-2010) was approved by the Council of
Ministers in October 2006. Second, the draft strategy for reducing the cost of doing business
was finalized in March 2007, while in the Justice sector, the Supreme Court concluded 66
percent more cases in 2006 than in the previous year, with activities in the provincial courts
increasing by 48 percent. This resulted in a reduction of the backlog of outstanding cases.
Third, to accelerate the enactment of approved laws, the authorities have assigned the
production of the Government Gazette to the Ministry of Justice. Finally, the Parliament has
recently approved the Labor law, which is an important component of the cost of doing
business.
Performance Under the PRGF
The authorities’ commitment to implementation of the reforms has resulted in meeting all
end-December 2006 quantitative performance criteria, except for base money for year-end
target due to the temporary volatility in currency demand around the deadline to exchange
the old currency for the new. In January 2007 the trend in this indicator was within the
indicative target for March 2007. The structural performance criteria and benchmarks
through end-March 2007 were also achieved, except for the benchmark related to the treasury
single account which has been delayed to end-September 2007.
Outlook and Policies for 2007 and Under the Three-Year PSI
The authorities’ medium term policy framework continues to focus on the consolidation of
macroeconomic stability. The medium term challenges facing the economy relate to the
timely implementation of the second wave of reforms, especially in facilitating
improvements in service delivery in the public sector and the creation of an enabling
environment for private sector development. Equally important is the need to improve
governance through the enhancement of coordination mechanisms within the public sector
and the generation of more domestic revenues from both the traditional tax system and also
from the use of natural resources.

3
Given the focus on growth, the authorities will take advantage of the current and medium
term favorable economic conditions to sustain growth at 7 percent and their effects to
substantially reduce poverty. A key medium term challenge is the scaling up of aid and
managing its macroeconomic implications. In this regard, the authorities will strike a balance
between the development and benefits from mega-projects and the imperative to improve
other sectors of the economy in order to expand exports in the traditional and in new sectors,
as well as on the growth of the non-traded sector of the economy.
Fiscal Policy
The Government is committed to continuing with implementation of measures to enhance
and strengthen domestic revenue mobilization and ensure raising revenues each year as part
of the exit strategy to reduce aid dependency. In this context, there will be no recourse to
domestic financing of the budget in 2007 and subsequent years. To reach the goals on
domestic revenue mobilization, the authorities’ revenue enhancing measures include
increasing the number of taxpayers, elimination of unwarranted tax exemptions, collection of
tax arrears, updating the specific fuel tax, and ensuring efficiency in the customs area.
The authorities are aware of the importance of maintaining prudent public financial
management (PFM) and have agreed on a detailed action plan and budget (APB) with donors
for the period 2007-2009. The APB will include, among other things, rollout of the budget
execution module to all central and provincial entities, customization for districts and
municipalities; introduction of Phase II of the budget formulation module; and developing
new modules functionalities.
Monetary Policy
Monetary policy will continue to target base money to achieve single digit inflation in the
medium term. In this regard, the BM will improve liquidity management to control base
money, in particular, in the context of foreign aid financed expenditures. To this end, the
Ministry of Finance will improve the preparation of cash-flow projections and ensure prompt
communication to the Central Bank. The BM will continue to strengthen its supervisory
functions and implement the organizational changes with a view to strengthening on-site and
off-site monitoring. The process of adopting IFRS in the banking system will continue and
will be extended to the corporate sector, in order to improve the ability to evaluate the quality
of the loan portfolio. In addition, new regulations on the assessment, classification and
provisioning of credit as well as a regulation of integral risk management for credit
institutions and finance companies will become effective in 2007. The BM will support the
expansion of the non-bank financial sector, and it will also continue to license and supervise
the microfinance deposit-taking institutions to facilitate access to finance by SMEs and rural
households.
Regarding the reforms in the foreign exchange system, a new foreign exchange law that
includes comments from all stakeholders will be submitted to the Parliament in July 2007 as
harmonization of various views took some time. Upon approval of the law and its related
regulations, the authorities intend to accept obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and
4 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement.

Structural Reforms
The reforms’ agenda to tackle the structural constraints of the economy are still daunting,
action-oriented, and well phased. Strong leadership in pursuing them is important, and the
authorities are aware of these and are committed. In the next three years, the focus of the
reforms will be centered on governance, improving the business environment and the
effective management of the natural resources. The main pillars of the public sector reform
are: (i) civil service reform, which includes the census and the wage bill reforms; (ii)
decentralization and use of the momentum in PFM reforms to sub-national units (provinces,
districts, and municipalities); (iii) the anti-corruption strategy which encompasses the
development of operational plans in five sectors, and the development of oversight and
monitoring mechanisms with ample participation of different stakeholders within the society.
The second wave of reforms puts emphasis on the business environment and the reduction of
the cost of doing business in order to sustain high growth in the medium term and support the
development of SMEs and transform Mozambique into a competitive economy as well as
serving as a location for FDI. In this regard, the authorities plan to embark on developing the
financial sector in order to increase access to credit and lower financing costs. The authorities
are implementing an action plan designed to reduce the cost of doing business and accelerate
business registration, reduce employment costs, simplify trade regulations, among other
measures. At the same time, the authorities will play an important role in supplying public
infrastructure and delivery of public services that will complement and enhance private
sector investment and productivity.
The Mozambican authorities are conscious of the importance of FDI in enhancing the
development of mining and other natural resources. In this regard, the government intends to
commence application of international best practices in tax structure and transparency for
these types of projects. A new legislation has recently been approved in the area of mining
and petroleum products. The government is considering following the Extractive Industries
Transparency Initiative (EITI), and is already participating in seminars and workshops on the
subject to get more insights and information on the way forward.
Conclusion
Mozambique’s experience with the PRGF arrangements in recent years was very positive and
created the basis for macroeconomic stability and advancement with the first wave of
reforms in the period after the end of the civil war. The prospects for the Mozambican
economy remain favorable in the medium term and the authorities have expressed strong
commitments to implementing the reform agenda as spelt out in PARPA II. The authorities
request the completion of the sixth review and the financing assurances, and the waiver on
the Performance Criterion. In addition, and based on the accumulated experience, the
authorities also request for a Three-Year Policy Support Instrument. They strongly commit
themselves to ensuring that the objectives and policies set forth under the PSI are achieved.
