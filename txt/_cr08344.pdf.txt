EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Ghana’s growth has remained strong, fuelled by both the private and public sectors.
The private sector has responded positively to macroeconomic stability and structural
reforms. But fiscal spending has also increased, reflecting investment to address growth
bottlenecks, as well as policy slippages. As a result, the economy is experiencing demand
pressures that are causing macroeconomic imbalances and increasing risks to external
stability; high twin fiscal and external account deficits have emerged and inflation has risen.
GDP growth is set to remain strong at 6½ percent in 2008; inflation is projected to reach
14½ percent by year-end; and international reserves are likely to decline to about 2 months of
imports.
Reducing excess demand pressures requires urgent policy adjustments. Postponing them
would pose risks to Ghana’s macroeconomic and external stability, threatening to undo much
of Ghana’s remarkable achievements in these areas. In staff’s view, the current policy mix
may not reduce prevailing vulnerabilities sufficiently.
The authorities and staff agree that fiscal policy needs to carry the brunt of the
adjustment. The government has announced its intention to deal with the main
weaknesses—high utility subsidies and the rising wage bill; however, implementation has
been slow. Staff projects that even with these measures the fiscal deficit will rise to over
10 percent of GDP in 2008 and 2009. Additional fiscal measures are needed; the automatic
price adjustments for utilities should be reinstated and coverage extended to all users, while
protecting the poor by better-targeted subsidies.
The Bank of Ghana (BoG) has increased its policy rate by a cumulative 350 basis points
in response to inflationary pressures and indicated that is ready to raise rates further if
needed. Staff noted that, to bring down inflation, the monetary tightening that began in
November 2007 should continue. Yet the central bank alone cannot fight inflation, and the
effectiveness of monetary policy is being increasingly undermined by loose fiscal policies.
A joint Fund-Bank external debt sustainability assessment indicates that Ghana’s risks
of external debt distress, although still moderate, have increased. Total public debt would
rise from 50 percent of GDP in 2007 to about 80 percent of GDP in 2028, implying serious
risks to debt sustainability. The authorities agreed that debt sustainability was important but
considered that prospects of oil revenue would improve the debt outlook.
Authorities and staff agreed that financial deepening was desirable, but very rapid
credit growth to the private sector in recent years raises concerns. The BoG has raised
banks’ minimum capital requirement and adopted several elements of the more risk-sensitive
regulatory framework of Basel II; staff indicated that additional macro prudential measures
were needed. Further interest rate increases should also moderate credit expansion.
There was also agreement that, if confirmed, the recent oil discovery could accelerate
Ghana’s timetable for reaching middle-income status and the millennium development
goals, provided it avoids the “oil curse” of weak governance and boom-bust cycles.
Ghana’s track record on transparency bodes well for governance. The authorities’ plans for
an appropriate oil management regime should therefore focus on demand management that
reflects the country’s absorptive capacity and does not crowd out the private sector.

Moreover, domestic food supplies have been

in food supplies and prices are a concern: flood damage in the north has led to localized food
shortages and sharp price increases.

budgeted because of hiring outside the
centralized budget process and higher than budgeted wage growth. Revenue performance
continued to be strong however, except from gold.

3.
Headline inflation accelerated to 15.3 percent in April 2008, as a result of both
demand pressures and rising world oil, and to a lesser extent, food prices. In recent
months food price inflation has started to accelerate, although it continues to be below
nonfood inflation.

5
4.
In May 2007 the Bank of Ghana (BoG) announced formal inflation targeting
(IT), which staff describe as “IT lite,” since exchange rate stability is an important
intermediate objective. Through September 2007, headline inflation stabilized at slightly
above 10 percent while core inflation fell to within the inflation target band of 7–9 percent.
However, since then both headline and core inflation have diverged from the target path. In
response, the BoG has increased its policy rate by a cumulative 350 basis points since
November 2007, but the policy rate has remained barely positive in real terms. Money
growth remained strong, although the demand for money increased and velocity declined.
Reserve money growth exceeded 30 percent for the second year, reflecting some increase in
net international reserves, while broad money growth accelerated to about 43 percent, as the
money multiplier increased due to the elimination of the secondary reserve requirement in
2006.

5.
Strong demand pressures have weakened Ghana’s external position, put
pressure on the exchange rate, and reduced the international reserve coverage. The
trade balance continued to deteriorate as rapid growth of non-oil imports (investment goods
and consumption durables) and an increase in the oil bill overshadowed good export
performance related to large terms of trade gains (11 percent in 2007 alone) and a significant
increase in gold export volumes. As a result, the current account deficit widened from
9 percent of GDP in 2006 to 11 percent in 2007. Strong capital inflows, including from
Ghana’s first international bond issue of US$750 million in September 2007 and partial
liberalization of the capital account, 1 helped increase gross international reserves somewhat,

but reserve import coverage dipped to 2.6 months at the end of 2007 in the face of very rapid
import growth. These trends continued through the first months of 2008, with international
reserves declining and import coverage falling to a precarious level of about 2 months by
April 2008. The cedi has depreciated by 7 percent against the dollar year on year ending midMay 2008.

6.
Growth in credit to the private sector accelerated to about 60 percent both in
2007 and in the first quarter of 2008. Part of this is financial deepening in the wake of
financial sector reform; a reduction in the reserve requirement and buoyant demand
conditions have also played roles, adding to cyclical pressures. Bank profitability has
remained generally good; the average risk-weighted capital adequacy ratio (CAR) is at
around 15 percent; and all banks conform with the statutory minimum CAR of 10 percent.
But worrisome signs have also emerged in recent months. The nonperforming loan ratio and
loan loss provisioning have increased and the default rate of households has risen (albeit the
level is still low at 1½ percent). Banks’ costs have risen due to higher wage costs and a rapid
expansion of bank branches outside Accra. The BoG has raised the minimum bank capital
requirement, stepped up on-site inspections, and is taking measures to make the regulatory
framework more sensitive to risk, including introducing capital requirements for operational
risk.
7.

Structural reforms have slowed in some key areas while progressing in others:

•

Public financial management reforms have advanced, but expenditure slippages in
2006–07 have exposed weaknesses in the system. Incomplete payroll automatization
has allowed line ministries and decentralized agencies to do significantly more hiring
than budgeted.

7
•

Civil service reform has all but stalled. Plans to “right-size” the large civil service
have not advanced. Following the passage of the Fair Wages and Salaries Act in
2007, the Fair Wages and Salaries Commission is not expected to make
recommendations before 2009.

•

In contrast, in other macrocritical areas, financial sector reforms continued, most
notably with the introduction of a new National Payments System to expand the
delivery of financial services, and debt management is being enhanced. 2 Fiscal
decentralization is advancing cautiously, and the authorities are drafting a fiscal
decentralization law aimed at improving public sector efficiency.

•

The overall business environment has also continued to improve (Figure 1).

8.
Overall, risks to Ghana’s external stability have increased significantly over the
past year as a result of loosening domestic policies and, to some extent, external price
shocks. Backward looking partial estimates of the equilibrium exchange rate still suggest that
the exchange rate is close to equilibrium level, and other indicators, such as market share and
cost competitiveness, do not suggest deterioration (Box 1). However, high twin fiscal and
external deficits during a global downturn are clearly raising both vulnerabilities and
prospects for an overvalued exchange rate.
9.
Ghana’s oil reserves, if confirmed, could be significant, placing it somewhere
between Chad and Equatorial Guinea. Major investments could start in 2009, and
production in 2011, and government revenues could reach a cumulative US$20 billion over
the production period (2012–2030), or about 4–5 percent of GDP per year (Supplement,
Appendix I).
II. DISCUSSIONS WITH THE AUTHORITIES
10.
Against this background, the discussions focused on the dual challenge of
containing demand pressures and addressing Ghana’s development needs:
•

What is the right policy mix for Ghana to address domestic demand pressures? What
fiscal measures are feasible on the short run?

•

How can Ghana maintain macroeconomic stability while both allowing private sector
growth and accommodating its large social and infrastructure needs?

11.
How should Ghana enhance its policies and institutional framework to prepare for its
transition to an emerging economy and the possibility of an oil era?

2

Following the guidance of Executive Directors during last year’s Article IV discussions, Ghana is one of the
pilots of the Fund’s medium-term debt management strategy project.

8
Box 1. Ghana. Assessment of Ghana’s REER
Ghana’s real effective exchange rate (REER) seems to have reverted to its long-term equilibrium
level consistent with macroeconomic fundamentals.1 The behavioral equilibrium exchange rate
(BEER) approach suggests that the REER is approaching its equilibrium.
•

The econometric analysis of behavioral determinants of the equilibrium real effective exchange
(BEER) is related to a set of critical factors: relative productivity; the terms of trade, and real
interest rates differential vis-à-vis trading partners.

•

The backward looking estimates still suggest that the exchange rate is close to its equilibrium
level. However, data limitations and structural breaks complicate the analysis.

•

Ghana’s export performance has been strong not only in traditional commodities (gold, cocoa)
but also in non traditional exports (Fig. 1), suggesting that the REER is not overvalued.

•

Recently, however, high twin fiscal and external deficits in the context of a global downturn,
high oil and food prices, and tightening global credit conditions are raising external
vulnerabilities resulting in exchange rate volatility.

further fiscal measures are
introduced in 2008–09, the fiscal deficit would continue to remain in the
neighborhood of 10 percent of GDP over the medium term, growth would slacken,
and inflation, while moderating, would still remain well above the authorities’
medium-term target of 5 percent. The current account deficit would remain well
above 10 percent of GDP, with total public debt rising to 60 percent of GDP in 2010.

•

An alternative scenario with additional fiscal adjustment in 2008–09 would lead to
higher private sector-led growth and lower inflation over the medium term. This
scenario would require that the fiscal deficit fall to around 7 percent of GDP by 2011;
subsequently, further declines to about 5 percent would be needed to stabilize public
debt at around 45–50 percent of GDP. Budget reforms, particularly eliminating
generalized utility price subsidies and reducing the size of civil service, would make
it possible to concentrate spending on priority development and infrastructure needs.
The external position and debt sustainability would firm up, and risks of debt distress
would decrease.

13.
The downside risks to the staff’s baseline scenario are significant, heightening
the need for tighter policies in 2008–09. Risks include a pronounced worsening of the
global environment, with a deterioration in Ghana’s terms of trade (mainly due to oil prices),
as well as a sudden stop or reversal in external financing flows, particularly portfolio
investment. Although nonresidents’ holding of domestic government debt amounts to only
about 3 percent of GDP and there is a minimum holding period of one year, a sudden
withdrawal of capital, or even just a stop in inflows, would pose some risks to budget
financing and ultimately to international reserves (Box 2). Weather-related shocks (drought,
flood) also can pose risks, which could be magnified by rising world food prices.

11
Box 2. How is Ghana’s Widening Current Account Deficit Financed?
Ghana has largely financed a rapidly widening current account with official financing
and foreign direct investment. These capital flows are less susceptible to market sentiment,
creating less vulnerability than sovereign external bonds and other private capital like
portfolio flows or bank borrowing. However, these forms of financing are also growing. In
particular, portfolio inflows have been

The data on private capital inflows probably understate gross inflows, and the authorities are working
to address weaknesses, in cooperation with Fund staff.

B. Near-term Policies to Reduce Risks to Stability
Fiscal policy
14.
The authorities and staff agreed that demand pressures had to be reduced
primarily through fiscal adjustment. To this end, the government announced in April three
measures to limit the rise in the deficit:
•

Adjusting utility prices. A price increase for commercial users to current costrecovery levels starting in July is projected to reduce associated subsidies by about
1 percent of GDP in 2008 and 2 percent of GDP in 2009. The authorities also stated
that cost recovery pricing might be extended to residential users next year, but this
needs to be firmed up after the elections; this measure would reduce subsidies by
another 2½ percent of GDP in 2009 and 2010 (not included in staff’s current
projections). Staff urged a return to an automatic price adjustment mechanism to
maintain cost recovery pricing and depoliticize the price-setting process. To cushion
the impact on poorer households, staff supported strengthening existing targeted
utility subsidies. The authorities attributed high production costs and associated
subsidies to exogenous shocks (low rainfall, high oil prices, and tight regional gas

12
supply) and considered that electricity production costs could fall in the coming
years, making the achievement of full cost recovery easier over the medium term.

Temporarily freezing hiring in the public sector (beyond the automatic
absorption of trainees in health and education) to keep the wage bill within the
2008 budget. The freeze should last until civil service reforms regain momentum
(possibly after the elections). The authorities and staff agreed that it will be also be
crucial to keep public sector wage increases in 2008 in line with the budget.

15.
Staff agreed that these measures targeted the right areas, but noted that they
would not be sufficient to limit the rise in the fiscal deficit from last year’s already high
level. Staff projects that even with the planned measures, the fiscal deficit will rise to
10.3 percent of GDP in 2008; without additional measures in 2009, the deficit would further
increase to 10.6 percent of GDP. The government therefore needs to prepare additional
measures, such as postponing nonessential capital spending.
Monetary and exchange rate policy
16.
The Bank of Ghana noted that the policy interest rate increases since October
2007 were appropriately large; nevertheless, they were ready to raise rates further if
needed. In particular, they pointed out that core inflation had been within the BoG’s target
range until late 2007 and that they had raised rates when it picked up. Notwithstanding the
recent significant policy rate increases, staff believes that monetary policy needs to be
tightened further to contain demand pressures. The policy rate in real terms has been barely
positive as inflation has accelerated. Staff’s model simulations, which are broadly indicative,
suggest the need to increase the policy rate further to steer inflation back toward the medium-

13
term target of 5 percent, particularly if fiscal policies are not tightened. 3 That said, it is
increasingly clear that monetary policy alone cannot fight inflation and its effectiveness is
being undermined by expansionary fiscal policies.
17.
Ghana’s exchange rate regime is a managed float, with a secondary objective on
the exchange rate to support the inflation target. The exchange rate has become more
flexible in response to market pressures and as the foreign exchange market has gradually
deepened. Indeed, the BoG’s share in total foreign exchange transactions has fallen recently.
Staff recommended accelerating this trend and decreasing the high foreign exchange
surrender requirements for cocoa and gold and phasing out the BoG practice of supplying
foreign exchange to oil importers. The authorities reiterated their long-held view that the
exchange rate is flexible and fully market-determined, and that surrender requirements need
to be maintained to manage lumpiness in foreign exchange receipts. Given rising current
account risks and low reserve levels, there is also a need to increase international reserves
gradually; the BoG may need to sterilize part of the resulting increase in liquidity that fuels
reserve money growth.
Debt sustainability

low. Staff’s analysis indicates that limiting Ghana’s debt to GDP ratio to about that level

Ghana’s risks of external debt distress remain moderate but have increased
since the May 2007 DSA. The baseline scenario incorporates the current
macroeconomic framework with higher twin fiscal and current account deficits
and information on new borrowing, including the government’s US$750 million
Eurobond issue in September 2007.

•

Stress tests show that debt burden indicators breach the thresholds in four
out of five bound standard stress tests. Some relevant shocks that breach the
thresholds include the impact of a one-time 30 percent depreciation, and
contracting government debt on less favorable terms. In addition, a stress test that
reduces drastically non-debt creating flows, including current transfers and FDI,
increases the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio close to or above the thresholds for the
period 2012-2020.

•

Ghana’s total public debt increases in the baseline scenario from about
50 percent of GDP in 2007 to 81 percent of GDP in 2028, indicating clearly the
risks to overall debt sustainability in the absence of additional fiscal adjustment in
the short and medium term.

•

As part of an enhanced focus on overall debt sustainability, a comprehensive
debt management strategy should be adopted that is consistent with
macroeconomic and other policy objectives, and explicitly recognizes relative
costs and risks. The recommendations of a recent Fund-Bank Medium–Term
Debt Strategy (MTDS) mission can be useful in this regard.

15
Financial sector stability
19.
The authorities and staff agreed that financial deepening was desirable given
Ghana’s low financial intermediation. However, very rapid credit growth in the past years
raises both demand management and regulatory concerns, as a recent worsening in some
asset quality indicators imply. The authorities took comfort in the fact that most of the credit
expansion was funded by increases in deposits. Joint stress tests by BoG and staff point to
some asset concentration risks, but they do not indicate that interest rate increases would
pose significant balance sheet risks for systemically important banks. The BoG noted steps
taken to further strengthen supervisory

C. Anchoring Macroeconomic Policy to Sustain Growth
20.
Discussions also focused on designing a policy framework that can better anchor
economic policy and manage both exogenous and policy-induced shocks.
•

The first element of intended policy anchoring, IT, could benefit from further
enhancements in communication and forecasting tools. The adoption of a formal
IT regime in May 2007 has enhanced the transparency of monetary policy; the next
priority should be to improve operational transparency. To make market interest rates
more responsive to inflationary pressures, the BoG could consider communicating ex
ante how it is likely to respond to various supply and demand shocks. As some
leading IT regimes have done, the BoG could consider publishing its inflation and
interest rate forecasts. Further enhancements to the BoG’s modeling and forecasting
will also help policy-makers better anticipate trends and policy impacts; Fund staff is
providing capacity building support in this area.

•

IT is now being complemented with a fiscal policy anchor. The authorities are
working, with support from the Fund, on a draft Fiscal Responsibility Law (FRL) to
improve fiscal discipline and anchor fiscal expectations.

16
•

Other important structural reforms need to advance: (i) public financial
management improvements are crucial, as expenditure slippages in 2006–07 amply
demonstrated. Particular attention is needed to control expenditure commitments;
(ii) civil service reform needs to resume in earnest, with the medium-term goals of
attracting high- quality labor and reducing total public sector employment, starting
with subvented agencies; and (iii) fiscal decentralization can provide efficiency gains,
but staff cautioned against allowing significant borrowing by local governments,
based on experiences elsewhere of high associated fiscal risks.

21.
The recent major oil discovery, if confirmed, could materially improve Ghana’s
medium-term prospects and its timetable for reaching the MDGs, while posing new
policy challenges. The authorities and staff agreed that any temptation to start spending
future oil revenue could exacerbate current demand pressures. Regarding preparations for the
oil era, the authorities have commendably started a national dialogue on the use of future oil
revenue, and they have been working on the technical details of an oil revenue and demand
management plan, with support from Norway, other development partners, and the Fund.
Staff noted that best practice measures for oil management include a well-functioning public
financial management (PFM) system and demand management with a medium-term
expenditure framework that recognizes absorptive capacity constraints. If oil is declared
commercially viable, large capital inflows would take place to finance oil investment, but as
much of it would fund imports, its impact on monetary and exchange rate policies would be
limited. In contrast, large foreign exchange inflows following the start of oil production at a
later stage around 2011 would pose challenges for demand management that will need to be
addressed in an appropriate mix of fiscal and monetary-exchange rate policies.
D. Other issues
22.
Policy dialogue between the authorities and staff has remained active since
Ghana’s completion of its Poverty Reducing Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement in
October 2006. Discussions on a Policy Support Instrument (PSI) started in the fall of 2007,
but they have not advanced.
23.
An interim Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) with the European Union
(EU) signed in December 2007 is likely to have a smaller negative fiscal impact in the
near term (estimated at about 0.5 percent of GDP). The interim EPA allows for 100 percent
trade liberalization of Ghanaian exports to the EU, with a transition period for rice and sugar,
and the gradual liberalization of 80.5 percent of imports from the EU over 15 years. Some
agricultural and processed goods are excluded from the interim EPA to protect Ghana’s
infant industries and preserve tax revenues.
24.
Macroeconomic data are broadly adequate for surveillance, but the quality and
timeliness of the data need to be improved. Specifically, for a country aspiring to emerging
market status and accessing international capital markets, meeting SDDS standards for data
production and dissemination should be a priority.

17
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
25.
Ghana’s growth has remained strong, partly fueled by a dynamic private sector
response to macroeconomic stability, structural reforms, and an increasingly businessfriendly environment. At the same time, there are still daunting development needs. The
combination of strong private sector demand and the fiscal expansion of recent years has led
to increasing macroeconomic imbalances, a weakening external position, low levels of
international reserves, and a rebound in inflation. Rising risks could undermine Ghana’s
hard-earned achievements in macroeconomic stability and structural reforms since the early
2000s.
26.
In view of the near term risks, there is an urgent need to pull back from the
expansionary fiscal policies of the past two years. The authorities’ announcement of a
package of fiscal adjustment measures is a welcome start, but its implementation has been
slow and more action is needed. The package appropriately focuses on cost recovery in
utility pricing, freezing public sector employment, and taxation of the gold sector. Full and
timely implementation is of the essence. To lower the deficit, cost recovery utility pricing
should be extended to all users and an automatic utility price adjustment mechanism should
be reinstated. At the same time, social safety nets should be provided with better targeted
subsidies for poor households. Cuts in nonessential expenditures are also necessary in
2008-09. Without additional adjustment, staff forecasts continuing large fiscal deficits and an
associated significant increase in total public debt over the medium term, with increasing
risks to external stability and of an overvalued exchange rate.
27.
Fiscal policy should also make room for private sector growth. Reducing the
fiscal deficit gradually and limiting it to 5–6 percent of GDP over the long term would be
consistent with the government’s objective of private sector-led growth while still allowing it
to undertake well-prioritized, growth-enhancing infrastructure projects. It would also help
limit total public debt to below 50 percent of GDP, broadly commensurate with Ghana’s
rating peers (after adjustment for concessionality of debt) and in line with moderate-to-low
external debt distress in the context of the low income country DSA framework.
28.
The ongoing monetary tightening is welcome and needs to continue. The
tightening could have started earlier, and further policy rate increases are needed to bring
inflation toward its medium term target. It would be also advisable to contain money growth
by sterilizing part of the much-needed foreign exchange reserve buildup. Nevertheless,
monetary policy alone cannot fight inflation, and its effectiveness is increasingly being
undermined by lax fiscal policies.
29.
The monetary policy framework has been enhanced by last year’s introduction
of an “inflation targeting lite” regime. With progress in goal transparency, the priority now
is to strengthen operational transparency. Enhancements to the BoG’s communication
strategy would help make the market more responsive to new information about inflationary
pressures and enhance the credibility of the IT framework.

18
30.
Increased exchange rate flexibility will help Ghana to move toward a full-fledged
IT regime and better respond to shocks. The exchange rate regime is managed float. The
BoG’s role in the foreign exchange market that has influenced market conditions is shrinking
as markets gradually develop; steps to phase out foreign exchange surrender requirements
and BoG sales of foreign exchange to oil importers would usefully accelerate this process.
31.
Rapid credit growth to the private sector raises regulatory concerns even if part
of the expansion reflects welcome financial deepening. The recent worsening in bank
asset quality is a warning sign. The increase in banks’ minimum capital requirements and the
introduction of a more risk sensitive regulatory framework, in the form of a simplified
version of Basel II, are appropriate. Additional regulations to limit potential prudential risks,
such as debt service limits, may also need to be introduced and scrutiny over banks’
collateral requirements and underwriting standards should be stepped up. Credit growth will
also be usefully moderated by the ongoing monetary tightening.
32.
A faster pace of macrocritical structural reforms would make it easier to address
Ghana’s challenges in its transition to an emerging market economy. PFM and civil
service reforms are particularly critical to make public spending more efficient and flexible.
33.
Oil prospects can materially improve Ghana’s medium-term outlook for growth
and poverty reduction if it avoids the “oil curse” of rent-seeking and boom-bust cycles.
Ghana’s good track record on transparency bodes well for minimizing rent-seeking, and the
Ghanaian authorities are to be commended for already having begun a nationwide
consultation on the use of oil resources. Building up an effective oil management regime to
avoid costly boom-bust cycles will also require good demand management—an area where
Ghana’s track record since 2006 has weakened.
34.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation will be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
GHANA
Joint IMF and World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis 1
Prepared by the staffs of the International Monetary Fund and
the International Development Association
Approved by Sharmini Coorey and Adnan Mazarei (IMF)
Carlos A. Primo Braga and Sudhir Shetty (IDA)
June 16, 2008
The external debt sustainability analysis (DSA) indicates that Ghana’s external debt
dynamics is subject to moderate risk of debt distress, and when taken together with domestic
debt developments, the overall assessment suggests that Ghana’s debt distress has increased
compared to the 2007 DSA. 2 This results from the recent rapid accumulation of external and
domestic public debt contracted on commercial terms, and high current account and fiscal
deficits that expose the country to structural vulnerabilities in the event of a reversal of
favorable terms of trade.
Two alternative scenarios are also examined in the Joint DSA. The first alternative scenario
combines lower GDP growth but the same level of external borrowing projected under the
baseline scenario. This scenario indicates that the risk of debt distress could become high if
higher economic growth does not materialize. The second alternative scenario simulates the
impact of recent oil discoveries on exports and economic growth. This second alternative
scenario indicates that, if oil-related fiscal revenues are used efficiently, the risk of debt
distress could become low.
A. BACKGROUND
1.
The debt relief provided by the IMF, the World Bank and the AfDF under the
Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) helped reduce Ghana’s total public debt to

2
about 42 percent of GDP in 2006 from 78 percent of GDP in 2005 (Table 1).
6
Public external debt declined to US$2,177 million at end-2006 (17 percent of GDP) from
US$6348 million in 2005 (59 percent of GDP). However, domestic debt increased to
US$3,133 million (25 percent of GDP) in 2006 from US$1,997 million in 2005 (19 percent
of GDP) on account of financing the rising fiscal deficit by issuing bonds with longer
maturities in the domestic market.

2.
Ghana’s public and publicly guaranteed debt increased to about 50 percent of
GDP at end-2007 to finance higher public investment, specifically the expansion of the
country’s electricity generation capacity and the development of the road network. Most of
this new debt has been contracted on commercial terms (59 percent) in the international
capital market, export credit agencies, and local-currency denominated government bonds.
In particular, in September 2007, the authorities placed US$750 million in Eurobonds with
a coupon of 8.5 percent at 10-year maturity, which was sold at a spread of 387 basis points
over U.S. Treasuries for the equivalent period. The remaining part of the new external
public debt has been contracted on concessional terms with multilateral institutions and
bilateral official creditors (Table 1).
B. MACROECONOMIC AND FINANCING ASSUMPTIONS
3.
The macroeconomic framework takes into consideration the impact of the
planned fiscal adjustment on growth in 2008-2009, while it is assumed that the
economy will return to sustained growth over the medium term. The Joint DSA
assumes continued macroeconomic stability over the medium term, the fiscal deficit
decreases to 7 percent of GDP while access to external financing amounts to an average of
6 percent of GDP. Inflation projections take into consideration increasing oil and food
prices in the international market in the short term, and the implementation of tight
monetary policy under the central bank’s inflation targeting framework (Box 1).
4.
Borrowing assumptions reflect the need to maintain a sizeable public
investment program over the medium term. Based on discussions with the authorities,
gross concessional flows are assumed to remain at between 6 and 7 percent of GDP through
2013, while nonconcessional borrowing is expected to gradually increase to 3 percent of
GDP over the same period on account of the implementation of the government’s public
investment program (Table 2). Interest rates reflect current IDA-blend terms for
concessional borrowing and market conditions for commercial loans with borrowing rates at
about 9 percent.

4
Box 1: Ghana: Baseline Scenario Macroeconomic Assumptions
Growth. Real GDP growth decelerates to 5.8 percent in 2009-10 due to fiscal adjustment and the
impact of higher utility prices on the output of the manufacturing sector. Thereafter, the real GDP
grows at an average of 6 percent over the period 2011-2028, driven by steady agricultural
performance, stronger activity in the construction sector related to public capital expenditure, and
investments in the mining sector.
Inflation. The inflation rate is projected to increase to 13.5 percent in 2008 on account of high oil and
food prices and domestic demand pressures. Inflation is expected to decrease gradually to an average
of about 9 percent in 2009-10. Over the medium term, and as result of tight monetary policy, inflation
is projected to decrease to the long-term central bank target of 5 percent.
The fiscal deficit is assumed to decrease to an average of about 7 percent of GDP over the longterm. The partial elimination of subsidies in the electricity sector would help reduce the fiscal deficit
to 7 percent of GDP in the long-term from 10.3 percent of GDP in 2008, while tax revenue
performance would remain at about 25 percent of GDP due to the continuation of strong tax
administration policies over the medium term.
External current account. The current account deficit will gradually decrease from 13.2 percent of
GDP to about 9 percent of GDP over the medium term, as oil imports moderate and exports receipts
increased due to a sustained growth effort in the cocoa and mining sectors. The reserve coverage in
months of imports of goods and services (G&S) would gradually increase to 5 months in the longterm from its current level of 2 months of imports.
Exports of goods and services. Exports are projected to grow at an annual rate of 8 percent in the
period 2008-15, and thereafter at 6 percent on average until 2028. Projections assume that mineral
products and cocoa would continue to be the main Ghanaian exports over the long-term.
Remittances are assumed to reach a peak of about 13 percent of GDP in 2013 and remain at that
level over the long term. Foreign direct investment is envisaged to average 7 percent of GDP over
the projection period reflecting capital flows needed to maintain the production level and
competitiveness of the mining sector in the long-term.
Official external grants are assumed to remain constant at about 3 percent of GDP over the longterm, while concessional loan financing is projected to decrease to about 1 percent of GDP over the
long-term. In addition, it is assumed that the sovereign bond issued in September 2007 would be
fully repaid in 2017, as originally scheduled.

C. BASELINE SCENARIO
The external baseline DSA scenario shows that Ghana is at moderate risk of debt distress.
The external and fiscal DSA assume decreasing fiscal deficit due to measures to reduce
partially energy subsidies, the continuation of strong tax revenue performance, and
macroeconomic stability. These efforts would in turn support the expansion of the private
sector and sustain GDP growth over the medium-term.
External debt sustainability
5.
External debt burden indicators are below the thresholds in the baseline
scenario, but all indicators steadily increase over the long term. 7 Ghana’s external debt
burden indicators remain below the established CPIA-dependent thresholds during the
projection period, while these debt indicators increased over the long-term due to moderate
GDP and export growth performance. All in all, external debt would increase from about 24
percent of GDP in 2007 to about 40 percent of GDP in 2028 reflecting increasing
commercial financing.

7

The World Bank Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) classifies Ghana as a strong performer.
The debt burden thresholds for strong policy performers are 200, 50, and 300 for the NPV of debt in percent of
exports, GDP, and revenue, respectively. Under the same strong policy classification, thresholds for debt
service are 25 and 35 percent of exports and revenue, respectively.

6
6.
Ghana’s risk of debt distress is moderate, as stress tests show that debt burden
indicators breach the thresholds in four out of five bound standard stress tests. 8 The
stress tests indicate that some relevant shocks that breach the thresholds include a one-time
30 percent depreciation and contracting government debt in less favorable terms. In
addition, a stress test that reduces non-debt creating flows, including current transfers and
FDI, to their historical average level minus one standard deviation increases the NPV of
debt-to-GDP ratio close to or above the thresholds for the period 2012-2020. 9 The same
type of shock would increase the debt service-to-exports ratio above its indicative threshold
of 25 percent. The deterioration of these indicators under a non-debt creating shock
illustrates the relevance of FDI and remittances to maintaining long term external stability,
and the urgency of implementing structural reforms that could help sustain higher economic
growth than the one projected in this DSA.
Public debt sustainability
7.
The baseline scenario shows that Ghana’s total public debt increases from
about 50 percent of GDP in 2007 to 81 percent of GDP in 2028. This increase in public
debt is well above the authorities’ reference level of 60 percent of GDP, as indicated in the
2008 Budget Act. The NPV of debt-to-revenue and grants ratio would increase from about
166 percent in 2008 to 281 percent in 2028, as a result of a protracted fiscal adjustment due
to high government expenditure in 2008-2014 in spite of strong tax revenue performance.
8.
Sensitivity analysis suggests that maintaining the current fiscal stance would
result in a sharp increase across all debt indicators and high fiscal vulnerability. If the
primary balance remains at its projected 2008 level (7.4 percent of GDP), the NPV of debtto-GDP ratio would triple in a twenty-year period (rising from 46 percent in 2008 to
134 percent in 2028), while the NPV of debt-to-revenue ratio would increase to 464 percent
from 166 percent over the same period. In addition, the debt service-to-revenue ratio would
increase up to 69 percent in 2028 from 26 percent in 2008, if the primary deficit is
maintained at its 2008 level. Overall, stress tests indicate that fiscal adjustment and a
prudent debt management and debt policy strategy need to be implemented to preserve debt
sustainability in the long-term.

8

The Staff Guidance Note on the Application of the Joint Fund-Bank Debt Sustainability Framework for LowIncome Countries defines a “moderate risk of debt distress” when: “alternative scenarios or stress tests result in
a significant rise in debt-service indicators over the projection period, the nearing or breaching of debt or debtservice thresholds, even though the baseline scenario does not indicate a breach of the relevant thresholds.”
9
The time series on FDI shows a structural permanent increase starting in 2003. As a result of this analysis, the
stress test on lower non-debt creating flows was estimated by using an FDI historical average based on 5-year
period (2003-2007), rather than the standard 10-year period.

7
D. ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS
Two alternative scenarios are briefly described in this section. The first scenario illustrates
the impact of lower real GDP growth rate if, for instance, the planned increase in public
investment are not adequately selected or implemented. The second scenario shows the
impact of oil exports on growth and debt sustainability. This second scenario is based on
preliminary estimates of crude oil exports with a 90 percent confidence and their likely
impact on fiscal revenue.
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIO: LOW-GDP-GROWTH WITH BASELINE BORROWING
9.
If the actual GDP growth rate is lower than in the baseline scenario, the risk of
debt distress would be high. This alternative scenario illustrates what could happen if
borrowing is contracted as projected in the baseline scenario, but GDP growth remains at a
low level because low-return projects were selected. Under these circumstances, external
debt increases to about 57 percent of GDP in 2028 (compare to 40 percent of GDP in the
baseline). This result underscores the importance of having a debt management strategy that
is complemented by an institutional framework that elicits the selection of high return
public projects with significant impact on productivity and economic growth.
10.
Under this low growth-baseline borrowing scenario, external debt burden
indicators breach the indicative policy thresholds under stress tests. A stress test in
which government borrowing is contracted under less favorable financial terms would
increase the NPV of external debt-to-GDP ratio to 90 percent in 2028 from 20 percent in
2008 breaching the 50 percent threshold for strong performers. Under the same type of
stress test, the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio increases to about 222 percent in 2028 from
45 percent in 2008. Overall, the external DSA in the low-GDP-growth scenario shows a
more vulnerable economy to changes in the financing terms for the government.
11.
Sensitivity analysis under the low-GDP-growth scenario indicates that total
public debt is significantly vulnerable to a fiscal shock. If the primary balance remains at
its projected 2008 level, the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio would increase to 131 percent in
2028 from 33 percent in 2008, while the NPV of debt-to-revenue and grants ratio would
increase to 447 percent from about 116 percent under the same type of shock. In addition,
the debt service-to-revenue ratio would increase up to 107 percent in 2028 from 26 percent
in 2008. Overall, stress tests in the low-growth scenario show that fiscal efforts and sound
debt management are required to avoid a fast accumulation of total government debt.

8
OIL SCENARIO 10
12.
The recent oil discoveries in Ghana would create a new exporting sector that
has the potential of guaranteeing much needed additional fiscal resources to achieve
MDGs and to finance higher growth. Preliminary estimates of the oil discoveries indicate
that oil reserves could be at about 500 million of barrels, and when they are commercially
exploited could generate additional fiscal revenues (including taxes, royalties, and direct
participation on production) of about 3 to 4 percent of GDP on average for the next 20- to
30-year period. Thus, oil exports might help finance growth, achieve export diversification,
and reach MDGs, if resources are used efficiently. 11
13.
The oil scenario shows that debt burden indicators improve considerably over
the long term. The main result of the oil export scenario is that the NPV of external-debtto-GDP ratio converges to about 9 percent of GDP in 2028 and NPV of external-debt-toexport ratio decreases to 34 percent. Oil production would definitely improve the
macroeconomic situation in Ghana, as the NPV of total government debt would decrease to
about 70 percent of GDP in 2028 (Table 3). All in all, Ghana’s risk of debt distress could be
classified as low in the oil scenario, as all stress test indicators remain below the indicative
debt burden thresholds.

10

At present, oil reserves have not yet been declared commercially viable. The IMF and the World Bank are
working with a prudent size of oil reserve projection, which, according to oil experts, has a 90 percent
confidence of being declared commercially viable. Also, the projections assume that oil revenues are used
entirely to retire public debt rather than to finance additional public spending. Other aspects about the oil sector
can be found on the annex to this supplement.
11

Appendix I describes the methodology used to incorporate the oil sector into the macroeconomic framework,
oil production assumptions, and its related fiscal impact on revenues and financing needs.

F. CONCLUSIONS
14.
The external DSA indicates that Ghana’s external debt dynamics is subject to
moderate risk of debt distress, and when taken together with domestic debt developments,
the overall assessment suggests that Ghana’s debt distress has increased compared to the
2007 DSA. 12 This results from the recent rapid accumulation of external and domestic
public debt contracted on commercial terms, and high current account and fiscal deficits
that exposed the country to structural vulnerabilities in the event of a reversal of favorable
terms of trade. The alternative scenario of low growth-baseline borrowing also indicates
that debt sustainability could deteriorate significantly, if higher economic growth does not
materialize. Under an alternative oil scenario and assuming efficient use of additional oilrelated fiscal revenues, the risk of debt distress could become low.

15.
Stress tests applied to total public debt underscore the need of maintaining a
sound fiscal policy and the urgency of implementing structural reforms aimed at
achieving higher growth and diversification of exports. While diversifying exports and
implementing structural reforms would contribute toward reducing Ghana’s external
vulnerabilities, these should be complemented by the implementation of prudent debt
management and debt strategy policies as well as developing a sound institutional
framework for selecting high-return public investment projects. Implementing these policies
is critical to help preserve debt sustainability.

Source: Staff projections and simulations.
1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

APPENDIX I. GHANA’S PETROLEUM SECTOR: PRELIMINARY MACROECONOMIC IMPACT 1
Ghana’s recent oil discovery, once confirmed, can have a significant positive impact on
national income, growth, poverty reduction, and debt sustainability. The exploration and
investment is expected to be fully financed by foreign direct investment. Following an initial
investment of about US$2.7 billion, production and exports would start in 2011, with a peak
in 2013, and a depletion of oil reserves by 2030. Cumulative government revenues would be
US$20 billion, or 160 percent of 2008 GDP.
IV. INTRODUCTION
16.
On June 18, 2007, UK-based Tullow Oil announced a significant off-shore oil
discovery in Ghana. The discovery was made by an Anglo-American consortium (Tullow
Oil operates with Kosmos Energy and Anadarko Petroleum of the US) in which Ghana’s
National Petroleum Corporation holds a 10 percent interest. 2
17.
On May 6 2008, Tullow Oil announced a
second oil discovery. This will probably encourage
increased exploration in Ghana, giving further
impetus to the investment plans outlined by several
foreign companies. The news is likely to result in an
upgrade of the current conservative assessment of
proven reserves of 170 million barrels to 500–600
million barrel mark. So far, there has been no
substantial discovery of an associated gas cap.

The discovery is yet to be designated commercially viable, and production may
not begin for three to five years. Following a full appraisal, the investment phase can start
perhaps in 2009, with an estimated cost of US$2–3 billion. Oil production could start after
2011.
19.
The state oil company, GNPC plays a key role in the sector raising an issue of
conflict of interest. GNPC is not only a producer of petroleum but is also responsible for
promotion of exploration and development of Ghana’s petroleum resources. Moreover,
besides its interest in upstream operations, GNPC also regulates the operations and
activities of investors, evaluates potential investors, and takes part in negotiations for
petroleum agreements. Monitoring of oil company operations is done through a Joint
Management Committee (JMC) which apply sanctions through the Minister for Energy. As
concerns are being raised regarding GNPC acting both as a regulator and operator, the
government is reviewing the appropriateness of GNPC being both a regulator and one of the
regulated bodies.

Currently Ghana produces small quantities of oil, about 700 barrels a day.

V. MAIN ASSUMPTIONS
20.
The main oil
production assumptions are
Ghana Oil Production
Millions of Barrels
derived from the GNPC
development plan, except for
Oil output, cumulative
the starting date, which we
Oil output, annual, left axis
conservatively assume will be in
2011 rather than 2010. Total
reserves are assumed about 500
million barrels (currently rated
as 90% probable). The first
phase would be development of
the core area; the initial
processing capacity of 60,000
barrels per day would be
upgraded later to about 120,000
barrels of oil per day. It is assumed that US$2–3 billion would be spent on field
development through 2011 and about US$200 million a year allocated for production costs.
Oil prices follow the IMF’s WEO projections minus a 10 percent prudential discount
through 2014, and they are assumed to remain constant thereafter.

Ghana’s existing petroleum regime provides a number of revenue sources for
the state 3—among them royalties, interest, petroleum income tax, additional oil
entitlement, and rental payments. Royalty rates are negotiated; for the blocks operated by
Kosmos and Tullow, the rate is 5 percent. The carried interest entitles the government to a
share of production after operation costs (including royalties) that have been recovered;
GNPC’s carried interest is 10 percent. The state has the option to acquire an additional
interest within a certain period after an oil discovery is declared commercial, at which point
GNPC has to bear its share of development and production costs. The petroleum income tax
law sets the income tax rate at 50 percent; but for the current discoveries a 35 percent rate is
applied. According to GNPC, petroleum agreements can also stipulate an additional profits
tax (the “additional oil entitlement”) that would be levied based on the contractor’s rate of
return to allow the state to capture a share of exceptionally profitable operations.

3

The main laws are the Ghana National Petroleum Corporation Law PNDCL 64 of 1983 and the Petroleum
(Exploration and Production) Law PNDCL 199 of 1987.

21
Box 1. Ghana: Main Elements of the Oil Regime

1. Royalties. A royalty is levied on gross production of oil whether or not the operation is profitable.
The assumption is that it will be paid in cash, but it could also be paid in the form of oil.
2. Carried interest. The carried interest is levied after royalty and operating costs are deducted. Again,
the assumption is that it will be paid in but it could also be paid in the form of oil.
3. Petroleum income tax. The marginal tax rate is levied in cash and applied after deduction of royalties
(considered a cost of production) and carried interest and after allowing for linear depreciation of capital
expenditures over five years.
4. Use of oil revenue. Oil revenues can be spent, saved in a stabilization fund or future generation’s
fund, used to retire debt, distributed to citizens, and any combination of these. In this paper for simplicity
it is assumed that revenue is used for debt reduction.

22.
It is assumed that all production is exported (thus there is no import substitution
at this stage) and that all after-tax profits of contractors are transferred offshore as well.
Direct investment is assumed to have a 95 percent import and 5 percent local content. The
impact on the current account balance in the initial, investment phase is through high
imports for investment financed by FDI; when production starts, production is exported and
profits are repatriated.
VI. MAIN FINDINGS
23.
With the start of oil production, real GDP growth will double to reach 12
percent by 2012, and then will be slightly

95 percent from imports in the investment
phase and then a rapid increase in
production and exports, which plateau after
two years and begin to decline in 2022.
Taking into account the fact that the oil
business is highly specialized, spillovers
are assumed to be modest. Ghana’s
cumulative real per capita GDP over the
period would be US$1,695 higher than
without oil.

The government’s share of total oil
receipts would be around 30 percent when production starts, reach 35 percent at the
peak of production in 2018, and then gradually decrease to 25 percent as production
declines. At the peak oil receipts would reach more than US$1 billion, accounting for more
than 10 percent of total budget revenues (excluding grants) or 2 ½ percent of GDP.

For simplicity, it is assumed that oil revenues would be fully used to retire debt
and thus no additional spending would take place. As a result, Ghana’s total public
sector would decrease from 49.8 percent at end-2007 and to 19.2 percent in 2028, as
opposed to 55.6 percent under the baseline without oil.
26.
The current account would be affected in the two main phases in a different
manner:
a. In the investment phase, trade balance would worsen significantly because
of the large imports of capital goods, adding some 9 percent of GDP to the
trade deficit in 2010-12. However, since investment is assumed to be fully
foreign direct investment (FDI) financed, Ghana’s reserve position would
improve, inter alia, to the extent of the 5 percent of local content.
b. In the production and export phase, the net improvement (oil exports minus
profit repatriation) of the current account would reach about an average of
4 percent of GDP per annum. During the peak of production (2013-22)
reserves would improve on average by 2.6 months of imports of goods and
services.

27.
The impact of oil production on Ghana’s external debt sustainability as well as
total debt would be clearly positive; for details see an alternative scenario
incorporating oil in the joint Fund-Bank DSA.
28.
Overall, the impact of oil on Ghana’s economy under these assumptions would
be considerable although not extraordinary. Growth would pick up relative to the non-oil
scenario and cumulative government revenues would reach about US$20 billion, equivalent
to percent of 2008 GDP. It should be noted that this outcome is sensitive to a number of
assumptions (net oil wealth would be depleted by 2030 and no other wells will come into
production; oil prices are constant after 2014 notwithstanding historical volatility of world

23
oil prices; the fiscal framework is unchanged, etc). More precise estimates on the impact of
oil can be made after Ghana’s oil is announced to be commercially viable, with firmer
estimates on the size of oil reserves.

The MDRI provides 100 percent debt relief to eligible member countries that qualified
for the assistance. Grant assistance from the MDRI Trust and HIPC resources provide
debt relief to cover the full stock of debt owed to the Fund as of end-2004 that remains
outstanding at the time the member qualifies for such debt relief.
_________________
Decision point - point at which the IMF and the World Bank determine whether a country
qualifies for assistance under the HIPC Initiative and decide on the amount of assistance
to be committed.
Interim assistance - amount disbursed to a country during the period between decision
and completion points, up to 20 percent annually and 60 percent in total of the assistance
committed at the decision point (or 25 percent and 75 percent, respectively, in exceptional
circumstances).
Completion point - point at which a country receives the remaining balance of its
assistance committed at the decision point, together with an additional disbursement of
interest income as defined in footnote 2 above. The timing of the completion point is
linked to the implementation of pre-agreed key structural reforms (i.e., floating
completion point).
Safeguard Assessment:
As Fund policy requires, the Bank of Ghana was subject to a safeguards assessment with
respect to the PRGF arrangement approved on May 9, 2003. The assessment, which was
completed on October 15, 2003, made recommendations for addressing specific
vulnerabilities in the external audit, financial reporting, internal audit, and internal controls
areas. The authorities confirmed that all measures proposed were implemented.
Exchange Rate Arrangement:
On February 2, 1994, Ghana accepted obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3, and 4,
of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement. The exchange rate regime is classified as a managed
float with no pre-determined path. The system is free of restrictions on payments and
transfers for current international transactions. At the end of April 2008 the average exchange
rate for transactions in the interbank market was GH¢1.005 per U.S. dollar.
Article IV Consultation:
On May 9, 2003, the Executive Board concluded the 2003 Article IV Consultation with
Ghana (IMF Country Report 03/133), endorsed the Ghana Poverty Reduction Strategy as a
sound basis for promoting growth and reducing poverty, and approved a three-year PRGF
arrangement amounting to SDR 184.5 million (50 percent of quota). On May 18, 2007, the
Executive Board concluded the 2006 Article IV Consultation with Ghana (IMF Country

6
Report 07/210) and the third review of the PRGF arrangement
(www.imf.org/external/GHA/index.htm).
FSAP Participation:
Ghana participated in the FSAP in 2000–01, and a Financial System Stability Assessment
(FSSA) was issued to the Executive Board in 2001. An FSAP update was presented to the
Board in December 2003.
Technical Assistance, 2002–May 2008:
Fiscal Affairs Department: All Ministry of Finance: peripatetic advisor on

APPENDIX II. IMF-WORLD BANK RELATIONS
(As of February 15, 2008)
I. PARTNERSHIP IN GHANA’S DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY
1.
Ghana’s development objectives are stated in the Ghana Growth and Poverty
Reduction Strategy (GPRS II) presented to parliament in October 2005. The objectives of the
GPRS are to create an environment favorable to private sector–led growth and sustainable
poverty reduction, and to create room within the Government’s budget for increased
expenditures on education, health, and other priority services. The overarching objective of
GPRS II is for Ghana to attain middle-income status by 2015, which entails maintaining
annual real GDP growth rates of at least 6 percent. High real GDP growth rates are expected
to result in positive social change and improvements in the quality of life for everyone.
2.
The Bank and Fund teams are closely coordinating their policy advice to the
Ghanaian authorities. There is collaboration in terms of common objectives and joint support
for implementation of Ghana’s GPRS, through for instance the recently completed joint
assessments such as the 2006 Joint Staff Advisory Note (JSAN) of the GPRS II.
3.
The GPRS II, and before that the Ghana Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS I),
created the momentum for a group of development partners (DPs) to align their assistance
through a Multi-Donor Budgetary Support (MDBS) agreement with the Government of
Ghana (GoG). The GoG and DPs consider the MDBS to be the basis for supporting
implementation of GPRS II through the budget. Building on gains made over the last few
years, GoG representatives and their development partners (nine bilaterals and four
multilaterals, including the World Bank) agreed on February 25, 2005, to work together
according to the principles established in “Harmonization and Alignment in Ghana for Aid
Effectiveness: a Common Approach for Ghana and its Development Partners.” The
principles agreed in that document were made operational at the November 2005
Consultative Group Meeting with the adoption of a Harmonization and Aid Effectiveness
Action Plan.
4.
Building on the GPRS II and the Ghana Harmonization and Aid Effectiveness Action
Plan, Ghana’s DPs signed a Ghana Joint Assistance Strategy (G-JAS) on March 1, 2007
which was prepared in consultation with Government and civil society, as a response to the
formulation of Government priorities set out in the GPRS II. The G-JAS provided the
partnership context for the Bank’s CAS discussed at the Bank’s Board on June 20, 2007.
II. THE WORLD BANK GROUP COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY AND PORTFOLIO
5.
The Bank Group strategy rests on three overarching objectives: increasing growth,
reducing poverty and reducing inequality. To achieve these objectives, the Bank also seeks
to deepen its collaboration with other development partners through the MDBS framework,
as well as through other partnership programs, such as those existing in sector programs for
Health, Education, Energy, Environmental Governance and Natural Resource Management,

9
Private Sector Development, Public Sector Reform, Public Financial Management and Water
and Sanitation. These partnerships also aim to harmonize approaches to the following:
preparation of analytical work; joint assessment of fiduciary underpinnings for sector and
general budget support; mission management; and program-based assistance.
6.
As of February 15, 2008, the World Bank has approved 133 loans, credits and grants
for a total of $5.617 billion. The current portfolio consists of 24 operations (including
Regional IDA and GEF support), as summarized in the table below, in the areas of
infrastructure, health and education, and government services totaling about $1.178 billion
with an undisbursed amount of $754 million.
7.
For the period covering the Bank’s Fiscal Years (FY) 2008 and 2009, the proposed
lending program supports the objectives laid out in the CAS through of three development
policy operations in (i) agriculture, (ii) environmental governance; (iii) decentralization;
(iv) social protection, and (v) the ongoing PRSC series, as well as investment operations in
the transport sector, ICT, and results-based management. These operations are subject to
discussions with the Government and the availability of IDA resources. A program of
analytic work includes a recently-completed country economic memorandum, a forthcoming
poverty assessment, and an annual external review of public financial management.
III. IMF-WORLD BANK COLLABORATION IN SPECIFIC AREAS
8.
As noted above, the Bank and Fund teams closely coordinate their policy advice to
the Ghanaian authorities, with a common objective of supporting the implementation of
Ghana’s GPRS.
9.
Areas where the Fund leads. The IMF leads the policy dialogue on macroeconomic
policies, such as fiscal and monetary policies. The IMF has supported Ghana’s poverty
reduction efforts through several arrangements under the Poverty Reduction and Growth
Facility (PRGF). PRGF reforms have centered on measures to substantially raise revenue to
make room for increased poverty-related spending and development needs, strengthen public
expenditure management, and use monetary policy to achieve single-digit inflation. The
sixth and final review under the PRGF was completed on October 27, 2006.
10.
Areas where the Bank leads. The World Bank, along with other development
partners, leads the policy dialogue on economic reforms in sectors such as infrastructure,
which encompasses energy, roads, and telecommunications, water, and sanitation; urban and
local government; agriculture and rural development; human development; and private sector
development and public sector reform.
11.
Areas of shared responsibility. The IMF and World Bank staffs collaborate closely in
supporting the GoG’s structural reforms in budgeting, expenditure and financial
management, public sector reform and privatization, and in the financial sector. Bank
support to governance and public sector management is provided through the ongoing
Economic Management Capacity Building project, as well as through the PRSC series.

APPENDIX III. GHANA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Data provided to the Fund are broadly adequate for surveillance purposes, but
the quality and timeliness of certain data need to be improved. There are notable
deficiencies in the dissemination of statistical information to the public, as well as in the
reporting for Fund publications, although the situation has improved recently with the
publication on the Bank of Ghana’s Web site of the Monetary Policy Committee Statement,
Statistical Releases, and monthly monetary series for 2001–06. Data for publication in the
International Financial Statistics (IFS) on international transactions were last reported for
2006, and monthly government finances for 1998, and on national accounts for 1997. No
monthly or quarterly fiscal or balance of payments data are currently reported for publication
in the IFS. The latest available data reported for publication in the Government Finance
Statistics Yearbook (GFSY) are for 2004. However, these data cover only the cash revenue
and expense transactions of the budgetary central government. Also, there have been long
delays in the release by the Ghana Statistical Service (GSS) of census and survey results,
irregularity in the quarterly statistical digest. The authorities are making efforts to improve
the quality and timeliness of economic and financial data through participation in the Fund’s
General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) and the external sector and government finance
statistics modules of the GDDS Project for Anglophone African Countries. GDDS metadata
have been posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB) since July
2005, but need to be updated.
National accounts and prices
2.
The IMF’s Statistics Department has provided TA on national accounts (NA) over the
period 2001 to March 2008. A “bundled” TA mission visited Accra during March 12–26,
2008. The main objectives of this mission were to assist the GSS in (a) developing a plan to
adopt the System of National Accounts 1993 (1993 SNA); (b) rebasing the national
accounts—currently dating from 1993; and (c) ensuring that plans are in place for a
comprehensive data collection program to improve the source data.
3.
As a result of a methodological change in the compilation of consumer prices in
1999, both the consumer price index (CPI) and the rate of inflation for the 1999-2001 period
may be underestimated. To address problems in the compilation of price statistics and
national accounts, a peripatetic advisor was assigned to Ghana during 2001–04. Follow-up
technical assistance has been provided under the GDDS project for Anglophone Africa.
Work on updating the CPI weights using the fourth Ghana Living Standard Survey
(1998/1999) was completed in mid-2006. In March 5–16, 2007 STA assisted the GSS in
developing a producer price index (PPI). As planned, the new PPI was released on March 15,
2007.
4.
The mission found that the project for rebasing the national accounts series to 2002
was only partly finalized, and that estimates for 2002 to a large extent were based on volume
extrapolation from the current base year 1993. Compared to this, the TA mission determined
that the 2004 Supply and Use Table (SUT) includes more updated and comprehensive

12
sources. The mission concluded that the quality of the national accounts estimates are higher
in the SUT 2004 than in the rebasing 2002 project, and recommended that 2004 SUT should
be the basis for benchmarking the national accounts. The mission also pointed out some
minor areas where changes to the estimates should be undertaken. In addition, there are still
some concepts and methods that need to be addressed further to insure compliance with the
1993 SNA.
5.
Improving the source data by creating a statistical system built on a regular survey
program is a priority for increasing accuracy and reliability. In this regard the following areas
require action: (i) design and building a business register that have a minimum of information
on output values, if possible input values, and the number of employees. The 2003 National
Industrial Census 2004/2 (NIC) serves as a good starting point, but must be maintained and
extended to cover also service industries; (ii) create a national statistical system containing
regular business surveys for manufacturing, construction, transport and communication, and
other service industries (surveys on retail trade and NPISH are urgently needed); (iii) create a
system for annual household surveys that is less comprehensive than the current Living
Standards Survey (round 5) 2005/06 (GLSS) and which could be carried out on a more
frequent basis; and (iv) carry out an agricultural census.
Labor statistics
6.
The scarcity of labor statistics is a cause for concern. Labor statistics are almost
nonexistent, although some wage indicators are available from the Social Security National
Insurance Trust (SSNIT). The Ministry of Employment has been receiving technical
assistance from the United Nations Development Program and the International Labor
Organization in the design and compilation of labor statistics.
Public finance
7.
Steps have been taken to improve fiscal data. The Controller Accountant General
Department (CAGD) currently compiles monthly budget implementation reports, and the
data are available within six weeks, although some factors undermine their reliability. There
are, for example, discrepancies in the data reported by the CAGD and the BOG. Above-theline data from the CAGD are narrower in institutional coverage than below-the-line BOG
data. There is a need for comprehensive and timely reconciliation of monthly treasury data
with bank accounts. To address these shortcomings, the government has formed a committee
to define the nature of “broad” and “narrow” government; moved to a system of immediate
booking for “direct debits” and more frequent reporting of government account balances; and
is implementing a new automated Budget and Public Expenditure Management System
(BPEMS). The BPEMS covers ministries, departments, and agencies. However, the
economic classification is not sufficiently detailed for data to be compiled in accordance with
the requirements of GFSM 2001. In June 2006 a STA mission proposed classification of
transactions in line with international guidelines.

13
8.
There are also problems of transactional coverage. The CAGD and the BOG have
been missing a substantial part of central government spending, such as donor flows
disbursed directly to ministries and those arising from internally generated funds. They have
also had difficulties in accounting for expenses paid by extrabudgetary funds. The operations
of special funds, such as the SSNIT, the Ghana Education Trust Fund (GETF) and the
District Assemblies Common Fund (DACF), are not yet covered in the fiscal accounts.
Although the majority of local government expenses are directly met from budgetary
accounts, the revenue of local governments and related spending, and transactions financed
from the DACF are not yet covered. Extending the coverage of fiscal data to general
government is strongly encouraged.
9.
Central government fiscal developments are primarily monitored from belowthe-line BOG data. Above-the-line fiscal aggregates are monitored by a combination of
cash-flow data from the BOG and identifiable components of revenue and expenditure
provided by the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning (MOFEP) and the CAGD. The
BOG produces revenue, debt service, and domestic financing data. The MOFEP Aid and
Debt Management Unit provides external debt data and information on foreign project loan
and grant disbursements. The CAGD provides data on noninterest recurrent expenditure and
domestically financed capital expenditures. The compilation of a full set of integrated
accounts that record stocks and flows for all the subsectors of the general government, in
accordance with GFSM 2001 guidelines, could improve and harmonize the fiscal accounts.
10.
Comprehensive solutions to some of the data problems may have to await full
implementation of the new BPEMS system and incorporation of Fund technical advice.
Various missions from FAD have suggested short-term, temporary solutions to alleviate
current data quality problems. A long-term advisor from FAD has been working on public
expenditure and debt management issues in the Ministry of Finance since August 2001. A
joint Bank-Fund mission in 2004 assessed progress on monitoring poverty-related spending
through the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Assessments and Actions Plans; a
Fiscal Transparency Report on Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) was undertaken
in July 2004; and STA provided further technical assistance in March 2005.
11.
The country has elected to participate in the UK Department for International
Development (DFID) under the Phase 2 initiative, which is a continuation of the DFID
General Data Dissemination System Project for Anglophone Africa. The purpose of this
project is to enhance the capacity of participating countries’ statistical systems. The DFID
Phase 2 Project will rely on the GDDS framework to introduce improvements in fiscal
reporting based on the methodology of the GFSM 2001. The Project ends in April 2009 and
is expected that two or three missions will be required to complete the GFS module. An STA
mission recommended an enhancement of the chart of accounts so as to include financing
transactions and additional details on revenue and expense classifications. This mission also
assisted the authorities with bridging their data with the GFSM 2001 framework. It
recommended establishing an interagency working group to delineate the general
government sector to ensure consistency of coverage amongst all datasets. The mission has
also initiated the compilation of data for extrabudgetary and social security funds and

14
recommended, as a first step, to expand coverage of fiscal data to at least the consolidated
central government.
Monetary statistics and international reserves
12.
The 2007 monetary and financial statistics mission found out that although BOG
had made significant progress implementing the previous missions’ recommendations,
further work was needed to improve the methodological soundness of the data. There
were still problems in the application of the residency criterion in the BOG accounting data
used as the source to generate monetary statistics, and in the sectorization of the government
accounts with other depository corporations (ODCs). The misclassification of central
government deposits as public enterprises deposits, and vice versa, distorted key credit and
monetary aggregates. The mission assisted BOG to automatically derive the standard forms
to report monetary statistics (SRFs) for the central bank (SRF 1SR) and the ODCs (SRF
2SR) to STA, in light of the recommendations of the Monetary and Financial Statistics
Manual. The BOG currently reports monthly data with a lag of four to six weeks, and data
from the ODCs with a lag of eight to ten weeks.
13.
The March 2008 follow-up mission found that significant progress has been
achieved in implementing the key recommendations of the 2007 MFS mission, especially
with regard to improvements in the data for the ODCs. In particular, monetary data for
September 2007 onward, which are based on the new classification of general government
units, indicate that central government deposits at the commercial banks were nearly twice as
large as the amounts shown in the unrevised data. Problems related to the introduction of a
new financial management information system hampered progress in improving the quality
of the central bank’s data. The mission agreed with the BoG staff on a plan to expand the
coverage of the ODCs to include the savings and loans companies, rural banks, money
market mutual funds, and credit unions; and compiled a comprehensive list of the financial
corporations operating in Ghana, including the timing and frequency of the data reported to
the various regulatory agencies. The mission proposed that the BoG starts compiling the Other
Financial Corporations Survey, covering the finance houses and leasing companies, by endSeptember 2008.
Debt statistics
14.
The responsibility for external debt recording and payment is divided among
three agencies. The MOFEP, through its Aid and Debt Management Unit (ADMU),
maintains the external debt database. It is responsible for recording debt-payment
obligations, issuing payment requests, and tracking HIPC debt relief. The CAGD confirms
the legality of the payment and authorizes the release of public funds. It is responsible for
accounting for debt payments and rendering reports to parliament. The BOG as the payment
agent for the government verifies payments made to ADMU and CAGD.

15
15.
An FAD technical assistance mission in 2001 concluded that the three institutions
needed to improve the transparency and accountability of external debt management.
The authorities should (i) develop a single computerized database that is available to all three
institutions; (ii) formalize procedures used for settling debt payments (including obtaining
debt notification from donors, delegating signing authorities of officials within the relevant
organizations, and creating registers tracing the movement of the documents required to
effect external debt payment); and (iii) improve the analytical content and timeliness of data,
which are not currently reported at regular intervals.
16.
To enable systematic comparison of the budget, the balance of payments, and the
BOG cash-flow data, the authorities should clearly identify the government subsectors for
which data are reported and prepare a clear classification of financing, outstanding debt, and
guarantees issued.
Trade and balance of payments statistics
17.
Since 1982 the BOG Research Department has had primary responsibility for the
compilation and presentation of the annual and quarterly balance of payments statistics. The
main data sources are the Customs Excise and Preventive Service (CEPS), administrative
data (government ministries and departments within BOG), commercial banks, and the GSS.
In addition, the BOG carries out simple financial surveys on other corporate entities that are
involved in transactions with nonresidents. Data are compiled based on the Balance of
Payments Manual, Fifth Edition (BPM5).
18.
Currently, the GSS is not publishing timely monthly trade statistics, although
the data are available from the CEPS. The staff has recommended that the GSS
collaborate with the CEPS to process customs data within six weeks and with the Ministry of
Trade and Industry (MOT) and the BOG to identify and reduce discrepancies in trade
statistics and to ensure that imports into bonded warehouses are not double-counted. Data
collection procedures of the CEPS need to be improved, and there is also room for improving
trade volume data collected by the CEPS through customs invoices, which would help the
GSS to extract meaningful import and export unit values.
19.
Fund staff has recommended that the GSS produce export unit values for major
export commodities, such as gold and cocoa. A high coverage of the country’s export
bundle can be obtained from just three major exports—cocoa, gold, and unwrought
aluminum. In contrast, deflation of imports is likely to require an iterative procedure to strike
a balance between coverage of the index and its stability, owing to the heterogeneity of the
basket.
20.
The BOG continues to implement the recommendations of a TA mission on
balance of payments statistics in 2000, including surveys of key establishments. (A survey
of shipping companies was introduced in 2004, but the companies at that time were unable to
submit the required data). Collaboration among the government agencies responsible for data
collection, moreover, has improved. A new immigration form to capture data on travel
statistics, in line with the Tourism Satellite Account designed by an interinstitutional
committee, was introduced in March 2005. The survey on private capital flows carried out in

16
2000 was published, and the BOG intends to implement a second phase of the capital flow
project. Ghana is also expected to benefit from a DIFID project being implemented by STA
on strengthening capacity for balance of payments and international investment position
statistics, of which monitoring capital flows is a key component.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with
Ghana
On June 30, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Ghana . 1
Background
The Ghanaian economy maintained strong growth of about 6½ percent in 2007 and the
first months of 2008. The private sector has responded positively to macroeconomic
stability, structural reforms, and an increasingly business-friendly environment. But fiscal
spending also increased, leading to excess demand. Supply-side shocks, especially
from international fuel prices, have impacted Ghana negatively, although overall,
Ghana’s terms of trade continued to improve. As a result, fiscal and external account
deficits have widened, and inflation has risen.
Recent economic growth in Ghana has been broad-based, and agricultural production
has remained good, although floods in the northern region of the country caused some
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return
to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive
Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board,
summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's
authorities.

localized food shortages and sharp price increases. The fiscal deficit (including grants)
continued to rise to 9 percent in 2007, reflecting both investments of about 2½ percent
of GDP to address energy bottlenecks and policy slippages with regards to utility pricing
and the wage bill. Due to delays in passing on the increase in oil prices to utility
consumers, and despite the eventual and significant price increases, utility prices have
remained well below cost recovery levels, giving rise to large budget subsidies. The
wage bill was higher-than-budgeted because of hiring outside the centralized budget
process and higher than budgeted wage growth. Revenue performance continued to be
robust, except for the gold sector. The fiscal deficit was financed by both domestic and
external borrowing, including Ghana’s first external sovereign bond issue and purchases
of local currency denominated debt by non-residents. As a result, total public debt
reached 50 percent of GDP at the end of 2007, up eight percentage points of GDP from
the end of 2006.
Headline inflation reached 16.9 percent at the end of May 2008, driven by domestic
demand pressures and rising world oil and, to lesser extent, food prices. Inflation had
remained stable around 10 percent from early 2006 to October 2007. Since then, both
headline and core (excluding energy and utilities) inflation have been rising sharply,
despite increases in the Bank of Ghana’s policy rate. These pressures also pushed
Ghana’s current account deficit (including grants) to 11 percent of GDP in 2007, as
continued export growth and terms of trade improvements were more than offset by
rapidly rising imports. Nevertheless, strong capital inflows enabled Ghana to increase
the level of international reserves, but the import coverage fell to 2.6 months of imports
due to rapid import growth. The Cedi depreciated vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar by 7 percent
from May 2007 to May 2008.
Structural reforms have advanced in many areas but slowed in others. Financial sector
reforms have continued, the debt management system is being upgraded to include a
medium-term debt management strategy, and advances are being made in fiscal
decentralization. Public Financial Management (PFM) reforms have also continued, but
expenditure slippages in 2006 and 2007 have exposed remaining weaknesses. On the
other hand, civil service reforms have slowed down.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted Ghana’s continued strong growth performance and
particularly the dynamism of the private sector. They noted the earlier gains in
macroeconomic stabilization and debt reduction as well as the structural reforms since
the early 2000s that have underpinned this favorable economic performance, and built a
strong foundation for achieving Ghana’s goals of accelerating progress toward achieving
the Millennium Development Goals and attaining middle-income status within a decade.
At the same time, Directors noted that since 2007 the fiscal expansion along with strong
private sector demand growth, combined with the recent oil and food price shocks, have

3

led to high fiscal and external current account deficits, rising inflation, and a weakening
of the international reserve position. Directors noted that the risks associated with these
developments could jeopardize Ghana’s significant and hard-earned achievements
earlier in this decade. Directors accordingly urged the authorities to give priority to the
near-term policy challenge of pulling back from the recent expansionary fiscal policies.
Limiting the fiscal deficit would also support the further “crowding in” of the private
sector. Directors welcomed the authorities’ recognition of these challenges, and of the
need for policy actions to ensure macroeconomic stability and for macro-critical
structural reforms to meet Ghana’s continuing development challenges.
Directors agreed that fiscal policy should carry the brunt of the adjustment. They
welcomed the adjustment measures announced by the authorities this year as positive
steps. These include moving toward cost recovery in utility pricing starting with highvoltage users, containing the rise in the public sector wage bill by temporarily freezing
public sector employment (beyond the automatic absorption of trainees in health and
education), and enhancing government revenue from the gold sector. Directors stressed
the importance of maintaining the public sector wage bill in line with the budget. They
encouraged the authorities to take additional measures, including cutting or postponing
nonessential expenditure.
Directors stressed that further fiscal adjustment will be needed over the next few years
to support macroeconomic stability, to ensure debt sustainability, and to make room for
sustained private sector growth. Key to lowering the deficit will be the establishment of
cost-recovery utility pricing for all users and the re-introduction of an automatic utility
price adjustment mechanism. These steps should be accompanied by well-targeted
utility subsidies for poor households. The wage bill will need to be contained through
implementing civil service reform that allows for right-sizing and increasing wages for
high-skilled personnel. Directors welcomed the authorities’ recognition that Ghana’s oil
production prospects should not weaken the resolve for macroeconomic discipline nor
defer essential fiscal reforms.
Directors noted that the recent joint IMF-World Bank external debt sustainability analysis
(which excludes the potential impact of the recent oil discovery) points to an increase in
the risks of external debt distress, although these risks are still moderate. They
underscored the importance of preserving the gains from debt relief. Directors also
noted that the oil prospects, once confirmed, can improve the debt dynamics
significantly, provided that the resources are used efficiently. A number of Directors
encouraged the authorities to adopt a comprehensive debt management framework and
to utilize fully Ghana’s concessional financing possibilities that still exist. Directors
considered that total public debt should be the main focus for debt sustainability, in light
of the rapid rise in domestic debt and the decreasing level of debt concessionality.
Directors noted that inflation has risen as a result of both domestic demand pressures
and rising oil, and to a lesser extent, food prices. They supported the Bank of Ghana’s

4

ongoing monetary tightening and noted its readiness to further tighten monetary policy
to bring inflation toward its medium-term target. Directors noted that the monetary policy
framework has been enhanced by last year’s introduction of an inflation targeting
regime. Many Directors recognized the challenges in this early stage of implementation
and noted that the experience gained would be important in further strengthening the
inflation targeting framework. Directors stressed, however, that monetary policy alone
cannot fight inflation, and its effectiveness should be enhanced through fiscal
consolidation.
Directors welcomed the recent exchange rate flexibility, which has helped the Ghanaian
economy to adjust to shocks and has supported the implementation of the inflation
targeting regime. They noted the staff’s finding that the exchange rate, in real effective
terms, appears broadly in line with fundamentals. Directors noted that the level of
reserves remains low, and encouraged the authorities to increase it. Several Directors
suggested that the authorities consider steps to phase out foreign exchange surrender
requirements.
Directors considered that financial deepening is desirable, but the very rapid credit
growth to the private sector in recent years calls for enhanced regulation. They
welcomed the increase in banks’ minimum capital requirements and the introduction of
elements of the more risk-sensitive regulatory framework of Basel II, as well as
increased on-site supervision. Additional macro-prudential measures will be required if
rapid credit growth were to continue.
Directors supported the authorities’ intention to enact a fiscal responsibility law,
particularly in light of the need to anchor fiscal policy in anticipation of possible oil
revenue. Oil prospects can materially improve Ghana’s medium-term outlook for growth,
debt sustainability, and poverty reduction, if the resources are well managed and used
effectively. Directors commended the authorities for having started a broad-based
national consultation on Ghana’s oil management regime.

Statement by Mr. Jafar Mojarrad, Executive Director for Ghana
June 30, 2008
The authorities thank staff for the policy advice and technical assistance they have provided
them in the past years and for their efforts in putting together the documentation for the 2008
Article IV Consultation. They also thank the Board and management for their continued
support and the international community for their financial assistance to Ghana, including
debt relief under the enhanced HIPC Initiative and MDRI. Support from development
partners has complemented the authorities’ strong adjustment and reform policies, allowing
Ghana to achieve a remarkable record of growth, macroeconomic stability, and poverty
reduction. Recently, however, a combination of internal and external shocks has put
considerable strain on public finances and the external position. As a consequence, important
economic and financial variables have deviated from their intended paths, although the
authorities do not consider these to be major policy slippages. Their response to the shocks
has been geared to laying a foundation for long-term growth and macroeconomic
sustainability. They are determined to safeguard their hard-won gains and would take the
necessary measures to get back on track.
Fiscal performance improved markedly during 2001-06, with significant increase in the
revenue effort and declines in the budget deficit and domestic debt. Public financial
management (PFM) has improved, as Ghana observed an increasing number of the PFM
standards for HIPCs. In 2007, however, fiscal performance was affected by the authorities’
response to a crippling energy crisis occasioned by a severe drought that affected the main
hydroelectric dam. They spent substantial amounts of money to increase power generation
capacity, supported the major energy agencies, and provided subsidies to consumers. These
actions were critical to averting a slump in economic activity, laying the foundation for
future reliable energy supply, and stemming social tension. The energy crisis resulted in
frequent power outages and rationing as the authorities implemented a load-shedding
exercise to protect the hydroelectric dam from total collapse. In the circumstance, they were
unable to apply the automatic pricing mechanism fully, given the risk of stoking social
tensions. The authorities spent considerable effort to establish the pricing mechanism backed
by an appropriate regulatory framework and targeted subsidies. They are keen to safeguard
the mechanism, which had been working well until the crisis. With some stability now
restored to energy supply, the authorities are in a position to phase in the pricing mechanism
by first reducing the subsidy to non-residential customers and then extending it to residential
customers above some consumption threshold. Restoring cost-recovery pricing would also
require improvement in operational efficiency of the utility companies.
The wage bill has been another major area of spending overrun. The excess spending went
largely to increased hiring for the key health and education sectors. The authorities admit to
ineffective application of hiring policy and the need for more work in that area. They also
agree on the need to reinvigorate civil service reform to achieve a right-sized, productive, and
well-remunerated work force. Keeping the wage bill under control is essential to avoid

2
crowding out priority social and development spending. The authorities see a need for fiscal
adjustment to reduce the deficit and domestic debt to sustainable paths. They admit that more
needs to be done to ensure effective control of spending. In this connection, PFM will be
further improved within an MTEF. A Fiscal Responsibility Law (FRL) is also being prepared
with Fund assistance that would buttress fiscal discipline and anchor policy and expectations.
The authorities successfully engineered inflation downward from 40 percent in 2000 to about
10 percent in September 2007. Since then, inflation has been on an upward trend, reaching
16.9 percent in May 2008. Demand pressures have been a contributory factor, resulting from
high monetary growth. But supply-related shocks, in terms of high prices of oil and food
together with the significant adjustment of utility tariffs in November 2007, have played a
major role. The Bank of Ghana (BoG) has actively responded to the rising inflation by
tightening policy and will continue to act as needed to contain demand pressures. Despite the
policy tightening, private sector credit growth has remained strong. Staff indicate that the
BoG policy rate—currently at 16.5 percent—has been barely positive in real terms, but bank
lending rates are up to 30 percent, although this has still not dampened credit demand. The
transmission of policy through interest rates may be limited in an environment of financial
dearth and would require some period of nurturing. Also, as staff recognize in the Selected
Issues (SI) paper, perennial supply shocks present additional challenges to disinflation in a
small, open, low-income economy like Ghana. In the circumstance, monetary policy runs the
risk of precipitating inflation spiral and short-term output loss. Ghana’s IT framework is in a
very early stage and experiencing the usual growing pains. Moreover, recent supply shocks
have complicated its application. The inflation forecast targeting (IFT) framework proposed
by staff in the SI paper that adopts a more flexible, forward-looking, and longer-run approach
to inflation targeting could be helpful in dealing with these challenges. It could serve as a
transition to a full-fledged IT. In any case, the authorities agree that monetary policy alone
cannot shoulder the burden of disinflation and will require close coordination with fiscal
policy.
The authorities recognize that greater exchange rate flexibility will support monetary policy
as well as the response to shocks. They reiterate that they do not target any particular
exchange rate, as the substantial nominal depreciation recently shows. The BoG’s
intervention in the market is limited to smoothing short-term fluctuations, building a
desirable level of reserves, and supplying foreign exchange for oil purchases, given that it
maintains surrender requirements for cocoa and gold. The surrender requirements are
necessary for the BoG to manage the lopsided flow of foreign exchange into the economy,
but it remains open to review this policy as conditions permit. The financial sector is
generally sound in terms of capital adequacy, liquidity, and profitability. Rapid credit growth,
expansion of the sector, and indications of some worsening of asset quality and asset
concentration risks, however, call for vigilance. The authorities are continuing with their
financial sector reform agenda, including in the areas of risk-based supervision and
recapitalization, which will help address the emerging challenges. They will take on board
staff’s suggestions towards further improving the financial sector.
Ghana’s external position has come under strain recently, with the current account deficit
widening along with a decline in reserves. A significant increase in imports has contributed

3
to the worsened situation. Most of the increase in imports was in respect of oil, due to the
higher price. Non-oil imports have also gone up, attributable largely to energy-related items.
Demand pressures must have contributed to the weakening of the external position, but due
recognition should be given to the role of higher oil prices and energy-related imports. Oil
will probably continue to exert pressure on the balance of payments and reserves for some
time until prices begin to turn downwards. The authorities are concerned about the
historically low level of income accruing to Ghana from the mining sector, especially the
gold sector that has witnessed considerable boom recently. The problem has been created by
the exceptionally generous incentives given as inducement to investors. Thus, while gold
accounts for a substantial portion of export receipts, its contribution to the country’s reserves
and budgetary revenue has been minimal. The authorities intend to correct this anomaly by
increasing the rate of royalties tax, enforcing current tax laws, and addressing other
administrative loopholes. They also intend to reopen some agreements based on present
realities and to introduce changes in the tax system.
The authorities worked hard to gain debt sustainability for Ghana, which they are keen to
protect. Recent increase in debt indicators, as indicated by staff’s updated DSA, has arisen
largely from investments in energy and physical infrastructure. These investments should
increase the productive capacity of the economy and its growth potential over the long run.
Any deviations from debt sustainability should be seen as temporary; it may have to get
worse before it gets better as the investments begin to bear fruit. Without making these
critical investments today, the economy will settle down to a low-equilibrium and belowpotential growth state that cannot support the desired path of poverty reduction and
improvement in living standards. It is in recognition of this long-term prospect that Standard
and Poor’s affirmed in February its ‘B’ and ‘B+’ ratings respectively for Ghana’s short-term
and long-term sovereign debt. The DSA does not appear to take full account of the economic
potential engendered by the investments. It is also noted that the DSA is based on average
growth of 6 percent, whereas the authorities estimate that at least 7-8 percent rate of growth
will be required to achieve the MDGs and launch Ghana into emerging-market status. This
higher growth trajectory would require a reexamination of resource, capacity, and policy
needs.
The authorities are delighted about the prospect of Ghana producing oil in commercial
quantities in the near future. They do not, however, regard this prospect as a substitute for
prudent policies. They do not intend to push the oil agenda too strongly and prefer to be
conservative in their assumptions. Although oil production would strengthen the balance of
payments and debt outlook, the authorities are not counting on this alone and would continue
to follow prudent borrowing policies and debt management. They have been taking several
important initiatives to prepare for the oil era to avoid the usual pitfalls associated with the
management of a major natural resource. These initiatives include a national dialogue on the
use of future revenue and consideration of an oil revenue fund and demand management
plan. Contemplated improvements in PFM and the introduction of the FRL will also support
these efforts.
The authorities recognize that there is scope for improving the quality and timeliness of
economic data. In accord with Ghana’s goal of achieving emerging-market status, they attach

4
great importance to meeting SDDS standards for data production and dissemination. They
continue to count on Fund technical assistance in this regard.
The authorities are once more grateful for the financial and technical support they continue to
receive from the Fund and the rest of the development community. They reaffirm their
commitment to sound policies and structural reforms to stay on track and preserve the gains
Ghana has made. They realize that they have to be extra vigilant and cautious in this election
year. They intend to remain closely engaged with the Fund to continue to benefit from its
policy advice. They also assure of policy continuity after the elections as a matter of
constitutional guarantee.
