THE BAHAMAS
STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
January 18, 2013

KEY ISSUES
Context: The economy continues to recover from the global financial crisis, with real
GDP projected to grow at about 2.5 percent in 2012, supported by a modest rebound in
tourism and ongoing investment projects. However, unemployment remains high. The
fiscal balance is expected to remain weak in FY 2012/13 and the external current account
deficit to continue high owing to substantial FDI-related imports.
Focus of the consultation: Discussions focused on fiscal consolidation, external
stability, challenges to sustainable growth in the medium term, and the
recommendations of the recent FSAP mission.


Implement fiscal consolidation. Containing the rising debt will require
comprehensive fiscal consolidation by addressing revenue underperformance,
rationalizing tax incentives, strengthening public enterprises, and improving public
sector efficiency.



Improve external sustainability. While the large external current account deficit is
predominantly financed through non-debt creating foreign direct investment (FDI),
there is still a residual and persistent underlying current account deficit (estimated at
up to 5 percent of GDP) that needs to be addressed.



Enhance medium-term growth. Sustaining high growth and employment will
require removing the key impediments to growth, particularly in the business
environment and in the provision of public services, and fostering linkages across
sectors by broadening tourism-related activities.



Further strengthen financial supervision and oversight. The non-performing loan
ratio remains high. Real estate prices have softened, reducing collateral values and
increasing the need for provisioning, as well as strong monitoring.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
1.
General elections were held on May 7, 2012, and the Progressive Liberal Party (PLP), led
by Mr. Perry Christie, defeated the incumbent Free National Movement government of Mr. Hubert
Ingraham in a landslide victory, taking 29 of the 38 seats in the House of Assembly. The PLP
contested the elections on a platform that emphasized the need to address rising levels of crime
and unemployment against a backdrop of weak economic growth.
2.
The economy has continued to
recover. Real GDP picked up in 2011 on an
improvement in tourism and ongoing
investment projects, including the
US$3.5 billion private Baha Mar project (Box 1).
Public capital projects, such as airport
modernization and road work, contributed as
well. Nonetheless, unemployment remained
high, as the recovery did not spread to other
sectors of the economy. Inflation picked up in
2011, mainly due to higher world oil prices.
3.
The fiscal deficit in FY 2011/12 (July
to June) is estimated to have increased to
about 6 percent of GDP, significantly higher
than the budget target. Revenues
underperformed, reflecting continuing weak
economic activity and lower real estate tax
collections. Current spending, particularly on
goods and services and on transfers (including
to financially weak public utilities) continued to
rise. Capital expenditure significantly overshot
target, largely on cost overruns on the New
Providence Road Improvement Program.

The marked deterioration in the fiscal position continues to place upward pressure on
public debt. The central government debt topped 49 percent of GDP at end FY 2011/12, an
increase of 17 percentage points of GDP over the past five years. Noting the country’s deteriorating
fiscal profile, and a change in its methodology that placed greater emphasis on ‘diversification’ and
‘growth prospects,’ Standards and Poor’s has lowered over the past year the sovereign credit rating
from BBB+/A-2 to BBB/A-2.

Box 1. Baha Mar Resort Project
The Baha Mar resort is a major tourism project on the northern coast of New Providence.
Construction started in February 2011 and is expected to be completed by late 2014. The project,
funded (US$2.45 billion) by the China Export-Import Bank and built by a Chinese construction
company, includes a range of hotel categories, residential units, a casino, a convention center, a water
park, and a golf course. The resort will cost US$3.5 billion (over 40 percent of 2012 GDP).
The project is having an important impact on the Bahamian economy. The start of construction
coincided with a period of otherwise weak economic activity, providing much needed stimulus and
employment opportunities. An estimated 6,000 construction workers are expected to be employed
during construction, with about a half of those jobs going to Bahamian workers. In addition, about
US$190 million is expected to be sub-contracted to Bahamian companies, of which some
US$140 million had already been committed by October 2012. As is typical of such projects,
Baha Mar is attracting large imports of goods and services, contributing to a significant widening of
the current account deficit (which is expected to average about 6–8 percent of GDP over 2011–14).
Air transportation capacity and the availability of trained personnel are challenges to be
resolved before the grand opening in December 2014. The resort will create more than 2,200 new
rooms, increasing total room capacity by about 15–20 percent. In order to accommodate the expected
increase in tourism arrivals, the authorities and representatives from the tourism sector have been
working together to enhance airlift from the United States, Latin America, and China. When fully
operational, Baha Mar is expected to provide employment for about 5,500 staff on a permanent basis,
most of whom would be Bahamians. The authorities are collaborating with tourism sector and
vocational and tertiary institutions to provide adequate and timely training opportunities to
Bahamians.

5.
The external current account deficit widened in 2011. Although exports improved along
with the global recovery, these were more than offset by higher imports, reflecting a surge in FDIrelated imports and high world oil prices. With large FDI as well as other private capital inflows,
gross international reserves remained at a modest level of 2.3 months of next year’s imports at end2011. However, measured in terms of non-FDI imports, reserves were much higher at about
4.6 months. The real effective exchange rate has remained broadly stable over the past four years,
reflecting both a pegged nominal rate vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar (along with a high weight of the
United States in trade), and similar inflation to partner countries.
6.
Monetary policy remained supportive, with the discount rate having been reduced by
75 bps in 2011 to 4.5 percent. Credit to the private sector increased moderately by 1.1 percent in
2011 (a turnaround from a 0.4 percent contraction in 2010), with banks being more selective and
applying more stringent credit standards, especially with less qualified borrowers. The nonperforming loan (NPL) ratio remained high (12.7 percent of total loans as of end-2011, rising slightly
to 13.4 percent at end-September 2012), mostly owing to delinquent mortgages and commercial
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

loans. In September 2012, the government started the Mortgage Relief Plan (MRP) to provide relief
to home owners adversely affected by the global financial crisis. The government announced that its
expenditure commitment to the MRP will be limited to a maximum of US$10 million (⅛ percent of
GDP).
7.
Near-term risks to the banking sector were contained. A Financial Sector Assessment
Program (FSAP) mission in July 2012 found that onshore commercial banks were well capitalized
(with capital adequacy ratios far above the 14 percent prudential threshold) and profitable (Box 2).
And supervisory oversight was strengthened, with the central bank improving the monitoring of
credit risk, including through enhanced monthly monitoring of credit quality indicators, monthly
review of provisions and write-offs, and by increasing the minimum capital adequacy ratio from
8 percent to 14 percent (trigger) and 17 percent (target).1 Further, spillover risks between the large
offshore and onshore financial sectors remained limited, owing to effective capital and exchange
controls.2

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
8.
In the near term, growth prospects are improving and capital inflows are likely to
remain strong, but fiscal imbalances are likely to persist and weak balance sheets pose
headwinds to growth.


Real GDP growth in 2012 is projected to reach 2½ percent, driven by strong tourism and
construction activity, but below the level required to absorb the high level of unemployment.
Inflation is projected to decrease to about 2.3 percent (y/y) at end-2012, mainly owing to
softer world oil prices. The external current account deficit and FDI inflows would remain
large and stable, with international reserves broadly adequate by end-2012 at about
US$830 million (2 months of next year’s imports or 4 months of non-FDI related imports).



The fiscal account will remain under pressure. The central government deficit would
remain around 6 percent of GDP in FY 2012/13, with some improvement in tax
administration and a moderation in capital spending, but offset by increased pressure on
current spending, including for crime prevention and community development. The central
government debt would rise further to about 54 percent of GDP. Additional fiscal pressure
could stem from contingent liabilities for public corporations, such as Bahamas Electricity
Corporation.

1

A breach of the 17 percent target ratio activates discussions with the CBoB about a plan to restore capital; below
14 percent, the CBoB could force the bank to restrict lending/asset growth until capital is restored.

THE BAHAMAS

Box 2: Key Findings and Recommendations of the July 2012 FSAP Mission
The FSAP mission found no short-term threats to financial stability. It noted that the country’s
financial system had weathered the global crisis reasonably well. Tight capital and exchange controls
helped insulate the financial system from global stability threats and provided the authorities
considerable scope for policy independence. In addition, while the offshore financial sector is
disproportionately large (with total assets about 65 times GDP), capital and exchange controls and
limited exposure to the domestic real estate market provide a credible and effective firewall that
separates the offshore from the onshore financial system, limiting spillover risks. Ongoing
macroprudential measures affecting global SIFIs could impact the operations of the offshore sector in
The Bahamas whose linkages with the real economy are, however, limited.
The onshore financial sector is resilient and could withstand considerable shocks. Onshore
commercial banks are very well capitalized and rely on traditional funding from deposits and equity.
While non-performing loan (NPL) ratios, which had risen during the recent economic downturn, appear
to have since stabilized, they remain elevated and are a source of concern. Stress tests conducted by
the FSAP team suggest, however, that the overall banking system could withstand substantial
economic, solvency, and liquidity shocks. Other financial institutions have limited systemic impact. The
credit union sector is relatively small, mostly well capitalized, and profitable. Credit unions, currently
licensed and regulated by the Department of Cooperative Development of the Ministry of Agriculture
and Marine Resources, are slated to come under the supervision of the central bank within the next
6–12 months. The insurance sector has stagnated, although it has achieved high penetration levels. The
securities markets are small and illiquid.
The FSAP mission concluded that the oversight of the financial system is independent and
strong, particularly with respect to banking supervision. The insurance and securities sectors have
recently adopted new legal and institutional frameworks, and their oversight is improving rapidly.
Notwithstanding these achievements, the FSAP team encouraged the authorities to persevere with
efforts to rationalize and further strengthen the supervisory and regulatory frameworks. In particular, it
advised the authorities to strengthen the current framework for financial crisis management and
resolution. The authorities are in the process of developing a National Financial Crisis Management
Plan, and recently completed a crisis management simulation exercise to inform their plan. In addition,
a Systemic Risk Surveillance Committee has been constituted to monitor the stability of domestic
banks. The FSAP team noted that the Deposit Insurance Corporation’s (DIC’s) equity capital is low by
international standards and would likely be unable to absorb losses in the case of a significant bank
failure. It recommended that the DIC’s capital base be strengthened and arrangements clarified on how
it could access backstop funding.



High NPL ratios remain a challenge, but near-term threats to financial stability are limited.
The elevated NPL ratios (13.4 percent of total loans as of end-September 2012)—reflecting high
unemployment and banks’ reluctance to foreclose on non-performing mortgages—are not
expected to reverse soon, as the debt overhang of the private households and firms is only
expected to fall gradually. Real estate prices have also softened, increasing uncertainty about
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

collateral values of nonperforming loans and possible need to increase provisions. Further,
business confidence and employment prospects could remain subdued, as concerns linger
about the global environment. However, stress tests conducted by the FSAP team suggest that
the overall banking system could withstand substantial economic, solvency, and liquidity shocks.
9.
Over the medium term, the economy is projected to expand by 2–3 percent, broadly in
line with that of the United States. Staff’s projections assume that construction activity will ease
somewhat as large projects are completed, and much smaller private projects are undertaken.
However, slackening construction is expected to be more than offset by a sustained pickup in
tourism activity as new hotels come on stream and partner country demand recovers. At the same
time, the tourism sector faces a number of challenges going forward, including designing an exit
strategy from air credit programs, expanding incoming airlift, and diversifying the country’s tourism
product as well as source markets.
10.
The medium-term outlook is tilted to downside risks. Medium-term growth could get a
boost if new tourism projects materialize and trade and industry initiatives under discussion
advance. On the other hand, external downside risks include adverse prospects for the U.S.
economy, the main source of tourists travelling to The Bahamas, volatile global food and fuel prices,
a decline in FDI inflows, and the occurrence of natural disasters. There are several domestic risks as
well.


With the U.S. accounting for about
80 percent of the total tourist arrivals, a
slowdown in the U.S. economy would
have a high impact on employment and
export receipts, and put pressure on
international reserves.3 Debt dynamics would
worsen, reflecting lower growth and higher
fiscal deficits.

A spike in global oil and food prices
would feed into higher inflation, since fuel
and food account for more than 40 percent
of the CPI basket. It would also weaken the
external current account balance directly
through higher oil imports (about
6–7 percent of GDP) and indirectly through
higher travel costs. A weak global economy
could compound these impacts through
negative-wealth and low-consumerconfidence effects in the U.S.

There are also significant downside risks
on the domestic front. These include (i) delays in implementing fiscal consolidation (especially
enhancing revenue collections) and reforming state-owned enterprises (including reducing
contingent liabilities), which could pose risks to long-term debt sustainability and the investment
grade rating;4 (ii) inadequate product and market diversification in tourism, to reduce
vulnerabilities to external shocks; (iii) high unemployment and crime, which could negatively
affect tourism if not urgently addressed; and (iv) a continuation of high NPLs, which could
compromise banking system stability. Further, continued low confidence in the private sector
could act as a drag on domestic activity.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
11.
The authorities and staff agreed that the main challenge facing the country was how
to rebuild macroeconomic buffers against shocks, while supporting growth and development.
The Bahamas emerged from the global crisis with less policy space—higher public debt and a lower
policy interest rate—and rising vulnerabilities. In that regard, staff encouraged the authorities to
implement fiscal adjustment while advancing structural reforms to increase economic diversification,
promote growth and efficiency, and reduce exposure to exogenous shocks. Against this backdrop,
the discussions focused on:


A credible strategy for medium-term fiscal consolidation;



Policies to contain the non-FDI-related current account deficit and build reserve buffers;



Measures to promote growth and improve the business environment; and



Initiatives to further strengthen financial regulation and supervision.

4

Citing the continued deterioration in the fiscal stance of The Bahamas, Standard and Poor’s reaffirmed the country’s
rating of “BBB/A-2” on September 24, 2012, but revised the outlook from stable to negative. On December 13, 2012,
Moody’s downgraded the country’s sovereign credit rating from A3 to Baa1, citing limited growth prospects,
significant deterioration of the government’s balance sheet, and a weakening of debt sustainability metrics.

A. Fiscal policies
12.
Staff urged the authorities to
implement a medium-term framework for
broad-based fiscal consolidation, reflecting a
balanced approach of raising revenue,
rationalizing expenditure, and reforming
public enterprises. In particular, staff
encouraged the authorities to consider: tax
reform, strengthening customs and tax
administrations, ensuring that public investment
projects are carefully selected, prioritized, and
monitored, improving public financial
management, and reforming public
corporations.

The public debt-to-GDP ratio is rising. With a primary deficit averaging 2½ percent of GDP

also explore other means to mitigate budget constraints, including through well-designed
public-private-partnerships (PPPs). Capital expenditure in The Bahamas is low compared to other
countries in the Caribbean, and key transportation, energy, and communications infrastructure
could benefit from upgrade and modernization.

Revenue underperformance should be addressed as a priority. Revenue-to-GDP is low by
regional comparison and persistently below expenditure-to-GDP. Further, the tax base is narrow,
and tax administration and compliance are weak. More fundamentally, staff emphasized that the
growth sectors of the economy—mainly the tourism and financial sectors—generate a small
proportion of net revenue, delivering low yield from growth and resulting in weak tax buoyancy.
Staff encouraged the authorities to



Public enterprises should aim to eventually eliminate deficits. The financial position of
several state-owned enterprises (including Bahamas Air, the electricity, and the water and
sewerage companies) is weak. They require continuing transfers, face challenges regarding the
maintenance of capital equipment, and are handicapped from investing in capacity-increasing or
efficiency-generating technological improvements (Box 3). The staff recommended addressing
their organizational and staffing weaknesses, improving their tariff structure, and investing in
critical infrastructure and equipment. To this end, staff welcomed the reforms that the

authorities are undertaking with regard to the Water and Sewerage Company (WSC), under a
US$81 million project funded by the IADB. This multi-year project aims at significantly reducing
water leakage, strengthening the institutional structure of the WSC, developing a master plan for
the sewerage sector, and reforming the regulatory framework for the sector.
13.
The authorities have expressed a
commitment to place public debt on a
downward trajectory. Staff estimates that an
additional fiscal effort of about 3 percent of GDP
(built over the years) would bring the central
government debt down to 2012 levels by
2016/17. The authorities agreed with staff that
such a fiscal effort could be attained through a
combination of a broad-based consumption tax,
savings from enhanced tax administration, the
rationalization of fiscal incentives, a reduction in
transfers to public corporations, and the use of
well-designed private-public-partnership
arrangements.

14.
The authorities concurred that delays in implementing fiscal consolidation, especially
revenue reforms, and the realization of large contingent liabilities from public corporations
could pose risks to long-term debt sustainability. They agreed that this would also weaken the
external current account balance, impact the credibility of the peg, and put at risk the country’s
investment grade credit rating.7 Staff’s public debt sustainability tests show that a primary balance
shock and a no policy change scenario will result in a steep increase in the trajectory of the debt-toGDP ratio (see Figure 4 on the fiscal DSA).
15.
Staff discussed with the authorities an illustrative scenario that would allow them to
attain a credible fiscal adjustment over the medium term. This would be achieved by first
curbing the growth in overall debt and then placing it on a sustainable downward trajectory (see
Appendix I). The adjustment efforts rely on a balanced approach that raises additional revenues and
reins in non-interest current spending, while preserving fiscal space for important investments in
infrastructure and human capital. Of note, the fiscal consolidation is not expected to have much of a
negative impact on growth, which in this period will be driven by FDI-related construction and a
recovery in tourism.

7

On September 24 2012, citing the continued deterioration in the fiscal stance of The Bahamas, Standard and Poor’s
revised the outlook from stable to negative.

A number of state-owned enterprises continue to face financial problems. The most prominent among these
are the Water and Sewerage Corporation (WSC), the Bahamas Electricity Corporation (BEC), and BahamasAir. A
common feature contributing to their financial distress is the accepted social responsibility of providing services at
affordable and unified prices to an archipelago of sparsely populated and dispersed islands.
Water and Sewerage Corporation
The WSC is tasked with providing potable water and sewerage services to New Providence and the Family Islands.
Historically, a large percentage of the population received water from wells, and discharged waste into private
septic tanks. Market penetration, however, has been low (the WSC provides service to only about 30 percent of
Bahamian households and businesses), limiting revenue performance. The low penetration achieved reflects, in
part, institutional weaknesses and inadequate infrastructure. Most of the population lives on islands, including the
populous New Providence Island, that do not have sufficient natural sweet water. Accordingly, the WSC relies on
expensive desalination plants to produce potable water for New Providence and the other Family Islands.
However, the WSC’s water delivery system is antiquated, with 55 percent of its piped water lost to wide-spread
leakage. The company also suffers from overstaffing and an inadequate tariff structure that, for more than a
decade, has not kept up with mounting energy costs. As a result, the WSC has run persistent deficits, requiring
government assistance to stay afloat—estimated at US$25–40 million annually—including through transfer
payments and loan guarantees.
Bahamas Electricity Corporation
The BEC supplies electricity to all the islands except Grand Bahama, using power plants that rely on imported fuel.
In 2011, BEC’s oil imports cost about US$360 million (about 4.5 percent of GDP), representing about 70 percent of
its total operating costs. In addition, because of the large distances between New Providence and the Family
Islands, the BEC has had to set up separate fuel-powered generation plants on each of the inhabited islands,
effectively eliminating economies of scale. While the BEC benefitted from a rate adjustment in July 2010 (the first
in seven years), its cash flow problems were aggravated by a three-year government program (2010–13) aimed at
alleviating the impact of high electricity bills on residential customers, at a time of economic distress. Under this
program, all residential customers (irrespective of income) may stretch out bill payments over three years at very
favorable terms. As a result, BEC’s accounts receivable mushroomed—even as its payment for fuel inputs soared—
forcing it to defer vital maintenance, take on additional loans, and accumulate arrears.
BahamasAir
BahamasAir has been the main air carrier mandated by the government to maintain air service between Nassau
and all the main Family Islands. Originally, BahamasAir enjoyed a monopoly on all domestic scheduled air routes.
However, that monopoly ended in 2006 when the domestic air market was deregulated. Today, there are 31
licensed, scheduled airlines operating air planes of 30 seats or more, in addition to nine smaller air carriers. These
private companies are free to cherry-pick profitable destinations to fly to, while leaving less profitable islands for
BahamasAir to serve. BahamasAir’s financial shortfall is significant, requiring annual government subsidies of about
US$18–20 million. Its problems are exacerbated by an aged airplane fleet that is costly to maintain and relies on
oversized propeller planes to cover the domestic market, resulting in steadily declining load factors. In addition,
fuel costs have more than doubled over the past decade. Despite reducing its staffing level through natural
attrition from a peak of 822 down to about 630, BahamasAir is still considered, by industry standards, to be
overstaffed by about one third, and its pay and pension structure to be rather costly.

16.
The authorities generally agreed with the thrust of staff’s illustrative scenario for fiscal
consolidation, but noted that they were not ready to detail exact measures or a timetable for
implementing their adjustment program. They explained, however, that they supported a
balanced approach, relying on both revenue and expenditure measures. Further, they indicated that
they could favor even more ambitious revenue enhancements and an aggressive reduction in public
capital expenditure over the medium term, provided economic recovery was more vigorous and
offsetting private sector investment picked up. Staff emphasized the need for quality public
investment, based on national priorities and consistent with the long-term development goals of the
country.

B. External stability and exchange rate policies
17.
Although the fixed exchange rate has fostered broad price stability, and the exchange
rate appears to be broadly in line with fundamentals, fiscal consolidation would contribute to
a needed improvement in the balance of payments. The current account balance was below the
estimated norm in recent years, largely owing to the financial crisis and weakened U.S. economy, but
the deficit is projected to gradually narrow over the medium term as FDI-related imports abate and
exports rise. Based on staff’s current account projections, the exchange rate remains broadly in line
with medium-term fundamentals (Appendix II). Estimates from the macro-balance (MB) approach
suggest that the projected medium-term current account deficit is close to the estimated norm,
while the equilibrium real exchange rate (ERER) approach suggests that the real effective exchange
rate is broadly in line with fundamentals. Non-price measures (for example, rankings in the World
Bank’s Doing Business Report) suggest that there is some room for improvement. Staff argued that
maintaining competitiveness (price and non-price) was necessary for external sustainability. In that
regard, improvements in competitiveness in the service industry, including tourism, and
implementation of reforms for fiscal consolidation will be important, going forward. Such
improvements in the fundamentals will improve the current account and competitiveness. Staff also
argued that, although The Bahamas has managed well in the past with relatively low reserve

coverage ratios, the vulnerability of export performance, as shown during the global crisis, suggests
the need for a larger reserve cushion (Box 4).
18.
The authorities expressed their commitment to supporting the peg and building
reserves over the medium term. They recognize the need for policies to further promote exports,
diversify sources of foreign currency receipts, and build more buffers to external shocks. Measures
aimed at improving the external balance span:

imbalances and maintain strong fundamentals to
support the peg.
19.
Staff stressed the need to improve external stability by reducing the non-FDI-related
current account deficit. While the large external current account deficit is predominantly financed
through non-debt creating FDI, there has been a residual current account deficit (estimated at about
5 percent of GDP) that needs to be addressed. The persistent deficits and modest reserves could
pose challenges to external sustainability in the face of adverse shocks. Staff presented external
sustainability and reserve adequacy analyses to highlight vulnerabilities. Of note, net indebtedness
(largely non-debt creating liabilities) to the rest of the world has increased sharply. Yet, rates of
economic growth have remained low, raising questions about whether the quality and mix of
activities financed by these liabilities were appropriate. Although the authorities’ growth agenda (see
below) should assist in reducing the current account deficit, mainly through promoting exports,
credible fiscal consolidation would also help to correct external imbalances.
20.
Staff and the authorities agreed that further monetary easing was not necessary at this
time. The central bank reduced the discount rate significantly in 2011, and further easing may put
pressures on reserves and the exchange rate. In addition, given that banks remain quite liquid, it is
not clear whether further monetary loosening will necessarily stimulate growth, especially in the
context of high NPLs, which may hamper banks’ willingness to expand credit.

8

The current account deficit is consistent with estimated norms, when imports associated with FDI-related projects
are taken into account.

Box 4. Assessment of Reserve Adequacy 1/
International reserves in The Bahamas have remained stable since 2009. In that year, external borrowing of
US$300 million and the SDR allocations of US$179 million helped boost the country’s external reserves to US$816 million,
from US$563 million at end-2008.
The Bahamas’ reserves are broadly adequate based on traditional metrics and under country-specific
considerations. The traditional measures (three months of imports, full cover of short-term external debts, and
20 percent cover of broad money) are based on simple rules of thumb. International reserves are more than adequate
when measured against short-term external debts. The
authorities also ensure that the country’s reserves cover

2,000

100 percent of the central bank’s demand liabilities, well
above the legal requirement of 50 percent. While
reserves are below comfortable levels under two other
methods, some country specific factors mitigate the

perceived vulnerabilities. First, given that a large part
(70–80 percent) of imports of capital goods is financed
by FDI, it is reasonable to subtract this portion from total
imports. Thus, measured in terms of next year’s non-FDI
imports, the country’s reserves are projected to be at a
comfortable level of four months at end-2012. Second,
the broad-money-based method is used to capture the

risks from currency mismatches and possible drains arising from bank runs. These risks are relatively limited in The
Bahamas, given the central bank’s effective controls on capital flows in order to ensure financial stability and manage
pressures on the peg.
The Bahamas’ position as a small island country with high dependence on the tourism industry suggests that it
needs to secure a larger reserve cushion. The Bahamas’
reserves are broadly adequate against a risk-weighted
measure, which is designed to reflect a broader range of
sources of risk, such as external liabilities, external
demand collapse, and potential capital flight. However,
the adjusted measure for small island developing states
(SIDS) suggests that the reserves are below comfortable
levels.2/ This measure is more stringent than the first
metric because it places a higher weight on exports and
short-term debts. It also reflects the high vulnerability of
small islands to terms of trade shocks and the ability to
borrow in times of need from their rather shallow
domestic financial markets.

C. Growth strategy
21.
Staff discussed with the authorities measures to enhance medium-term growth and
employment. Economic growth can be further strengthened by a broad strategy that identifies and
removes key impediments to private sector activity. The growth strategy would also need to be
complemented by measures to strengthen the business environment, improve physical
infrastructure (including public utilities) enhance human capital, and address social tensions and
reduce crime.
22.
The authorities are formulating a strategy to improve growth performance. While nearterm growth is expected to be driven by the recovery of tourism and ongoing large construction
projects, the authorities’ plan embraces economic diversification, including of the tourism industry;
and identifying and removing growth-constraining factors in the business environment.


Diversification. The authorities recognize the need for policies to diversify the overall economy
(including within the tourism industry). Measures aimed at enhancing diversification include:
(i) supporting tourism by increasing airlift,9 including to the Family Islands, and expanding
programs to boost cruise arrivals; (ii) encouraging human capital investment, including through
language and culture training; (iii) promoting linkages between tourism and the rest of the
economy, including agriculture and creative industries; (iv) leveraging existing trade protocols to
develop industries in logistics and intellectual property; (iv) further developing financial and
other professional services, including in arbitration; and (v) incentivizing investment into the
Family Islands.



Improving the business environment. The authorities intend to achieve requirements for
World Trade Organization (WTO) accession,10 adopt measures to address the country’s lowestranking indicators in the World Bank’s Doing Business Report, and launch an e-government
project. Initiatives are being implemented, with the appropriate legislation and inter-agency
collaboration, to improve efficiency in the Office of the Attorney General, including enhanced
administration of justice and dispute resolution, incorporation and dissolution of corporations,
the issuance of official public registrar documents, and management of intellectual property.



Reducing unemployment. Ongoing infrastructure and private sector investment projects have
created employment opportunities, promising to reduce social tensions and boost domestic
demand.

9

Authorities and representatives from the tourism sector have been working together to increase airlift from the
United States., Latin America, and China, to tap new markets and cater to the opening of the Baha Mar resort.
10

The recent efforts include an ongoing initiative to modernize the Bahamas Customs Department, which is funded
by IADB and one of the key elements toward WTO accession.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

THE BAHAMAS



Combating crime. The authorities aim to reduce crime by providing greater resources to law
enforcement, expanding the courts system, strengthening the prosecutorial process, and
promoting urban renewal.11

23.
Staff welcomed the authorities’ broadbased strategy to enhance growth. Staff
highlighted the need for diversification to foster
medium-term growth, emphasizing that the
ongoing large construction activities are expected
to end by 2015, and the tourism sector’s growth
will eventually moderate as new capacity is
gradually filled. Staff also underscored the
benefits of promoting innovative high valueadded downstream tourism products to foster
linkages across sectors, improving economic
diversification and employment.

D. Financial sector oversight
24.
The financial system faces no serious near-term stability threats. However, the
authorities should continue to strengthen the regulatory, supervisory, crisis management, and
financial safety net frameworks to ensure the financial system remains robust. Stress tests conducted
by the FSAP team show that the domestic banking system can withstand a range of adverse
scenarios, including the effects of sizeable hurricanes. While, resilience varies across individual
banks, no systemically large banks appear to show serious vulnerabilities. Further, spillover risks
between banks and other domestic financial institutions and between the offshore and onshore
financial systems appear minimal.
25.
The main challenge is a still high level of non-performing loans. Although banks are well
capitalized, liquid, and profitable, the non-performing loan (NPL) ratio remains high (13.4 percent of
total loans as of September 2012), mostly owing to delinquent mortgages and commercial loans. 12
The banking system’s ample capital buffers provide shock-absorbing capacity. However,
downgrades of adversely classified and restructured loans to lower categories could exert pressure
to raise the amount of provisions that banks need to set aside against loan losses. Further, there is
some degree of uncertainty on the value of underlying collateral for non-performing mortgages,
which constitute over half of NPLs. The authorities remain vigilant about the potential impact of
NPLs on bank capital and have substantially improved credit risk monitoring of onshore commercial
banks.

11

These efforts are being supported by institutional strengthening (“Swift Justice Initiative”) and the better use of
information technology (“Integrated Justice system”).
12

The Mortgage Relief Plan, started in September 2012, has received fewer eligible applicants than expected, and it
is expected to have a marginal impact on non-performing mortgage loans.

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

THE BAHAMAS

26.
The central bank has pursued macro-prudential policies to contain financial risks. A
CAR trigger of 14 percent was introduced early in the global financial crisis, to better monitor banks,
and a debt service-to-income limit of 45 percent was imposed on household loans. Since November
2009, banks have been restricted from distributing dividends without central bank approval. In
addition, the central bank maintained at 85 percent the maximum loan-to-value ratio for personal
loans, and kept the foreign exchange net open position limit at 5 percent of total Tier 1 capital, up
to a maximum of US$5 million.
27.
Oversight of the financial system has improved significantly. The supervisory authorities
have implemented or are in the process of implementing a risk-based approach for both onshore
and offshore sectors, supported by a regime of information sharing and regulatory colleges. Staff
encouraged the use of guidelines on the scope and methods of consolidated supervision, as well as
for managing operational, interest rate, and market risk, consistent with Basle III principles. The
authorities have committed to undertaking an assessment of Anti-Money Laundering and
Combating the Financing of Terrorism, within 18 months after the FSAP mission and under the
Caribbean Financial Action Task Force’s next round of evaluations.
28.
Staff welcomed the authorities’ initiative to develop a National Financial Crisis
Management Plan (NFCMP). The central bank has designated all onshore commercial banks as
systemic for the purpose of supervision, but agrees that there needs to be a more narrowly tailored
definition to determine those banks eligible for solvency support or other extraordinary intervention.
Other areas for improvement include the legal power to provide financial assistance under law, the
legal provisions for receivership and resolution of financial institutions, and access to backstop
funding by the Deposit Insurance Corporation, to allow absorption of losses in the case of a
significant bank failure. The resilience of the financial sector will also benefit from the establishment
of the proposed credit bureau, as well as reforms to strengthen the regulatory and supervisory
frameworks for non-banks, including by bringing credit unions under central bank supervision.
29.
The authorities generally agreed with the recommendations of the FSAP mission. They
highlighted their ongoing work to improve supervision and regulation of credit unions and to
establish credit bureaus as examples of their commitment to improve the financial soundness.
Further, they had also engaged external advisors to conduct a simulation exercise in crisis
management in early November 2012. The objective was to acquaint the various high-level officers
and government officials of their roles and responsibilities in the event of a crisis, identify lines and
sequence of communications, with the view to preparing a reference manual.

STAFF APPRAISAL
30.
The Bahamas economy is recovering from the global financial crisis. However,
unemployment remains high, and public debt has risen substantially since the crisis broke. Real GDP
growth is projected to pick up in 2012 and over the medium term, supported by strong activity in
the construction sector and a bounce in tourism. The Bahamas is also poised to experience a marked
increase in tourism activity, as capacity expands and partner countries recover. Inflation remains
contained at around partner-country levels.
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

THE BAHAMAS

31.
Immediate and credible fiscal consolidation remains the key policy priority. The
objective should be to curb the rise of, and then significantly reduce, the public debt-to-GDP ratio
over the medium term, to restore policy buffers. Such an approach would need to include raising
revenue collections, by strengthening tax administration and introducing new consumption or
corporate income taxes, reining in current spending, in particular on wages, goods and services, and
transfers and subsidies, and reforming public enterprises to make them commercially viable, thereby
reducing the need for subsidies.
32.
Staff welcomes the authorities’ commitment to the U.S. dollar peg by encouraging
foreign direct investment and boosting reserves. Staff calculations suggest that the exchange
rate is broadly in line with fundamentals, and the U.S. dollar peg has served the country well over
the years, enjoying widespread support and contributing to broad price stability. The recent global
crisis has, however, increased the country’s external vulnerability. Against this backdrop, staff
encourages the authorities to continue their efforts to promote exports, especially tourism, and
generally contain domestic demand, including through credible fiscal consolidation. Such measures
to strengthen the fundamentals will bring about desirable shifts in the current account and real
effective exchange rate. In this context, staff does not consider monetary easing to be appropriate,
at this stage.
33.
Staff supports the authorities’ strategy of fostering growth over the medium to long
term. While private and publicly financed construction in resorts and physical infrastructure are
expected to sustain growth over the coming few years, the authorities are appropriately engaged in
removing hurdles to longer-term economic development. Staff welcomes their efforts to diversify
the economy, including by promoting closer linkages between the large tourism sector and other
local industries; improving the business climate and streamlining government operations and
certification procedures; and tackling crime and promote community development and urban
renewal.
34.
The Bahamian financial system faces no obvious serious threats to its near-term
stability. Stress tests confirmed that onshore banks can generally withstand severe shocks to
solvency and liquidity, and that the risks of spillovers between onshore and offshore banks are
limited. However, the authorities will need to monitor credit risk closely given the relatively high
levels of NPLs, predominantly in mortgages. Financial system oversight has improved greatly over
the last decade but further strengthening is needed, particularly in insurance and securities. Staff
welcomes the authorities’ commitment to strengthen their crisis prevention and resolution
frameworks, as well as their efforts to improve the regulatory and supervisory framework for credit
unions and establish a credit bureau to better monitor consumer credit inside and outside the
banking system.
35.
Staff proposes that The Bahamas remain on the standard 12-month Article IV
consultation cycle.

1/ Indicate coverage of public sector, e.g., general government or nonfinancial public sector. Also whether net or gross debt is used.
2/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; a = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Appendix I: Illustrative Scenario for Fiscal Consolidation
A feasible scenario for placing public debt on a sustainable downward trajectory is illustrated. It raises
revenues and reins in non-interest current spending, while preserving fiscal space for important
investments in infrastructure and human capital.

Revenue measures
While the focus in the short-to-medium term would be on tax revenue, nontax revenue could
be improved in the long run, once the financial health of state-owned enterprises has been
strengthened and they become profitable. It is therefore assumed that tax collections would be
enhanced by about 1½ percentage points of GDP over the next 5 years (i.e., relative to the baseline
scenario in FY 2016/17) by:


Adjusting current tax rates (such as on taxes on tourism or excises); and



Introducing new tax sources, possibly through a new income/corporate tax or a broad-based
consumption tax (such as a VAT).

These illustrative projections also assume that the introduction of new revenue measures (or
improving tax administration) would required 2–3 years to be fully effective.

Expenditure measures
Discretionary spending could be reduced by about 1⅓ percentage points of GDP relative to
the levels in FY 2016/17. These savings could come from:


wages (0.3percent of GDP);



goods and services (0.2 percent); as well as



transfers and subsidies (0.6 percent) and net lending (0.2 percent), as a result of
efficiency gains in the operations of state-owned enterprises through better
management and appropriate tariff adjustments.

An additional ¼ percent of GDP could be saved in interest rate payments, from an improvement in
the debt dynamics (i.e., lower debt stock and lower interest rates).

Debt
If these or similar measures are introduced at an early stage, legislated, and implemented
with determination, the illustrative projections suggest that the growth of total debt would
be slowed substantially. Thus, rather than steadily increasing through FY 2016/17 to over
62 percent of GDP, the central government debt would peak in FY 2014/15 at about 54½ percent of
GDP and thereafter decline gradually to about 52½ percent of GDP at end-FY 2016/17 (almost
10 percentage points of GDP lower than under the baseline scenario). In this context, it is also
assumed that by the end of the projection period the stock of debt at the public enterprises would
decline by about one percentage point of GDP, mainly through efficiency gains. Accordingly, total
debt in FY 2016/17 would be about 11 percent of GDP lower than under the baseline scenario.

Appendix II: External Stability and Competitiveness
Assessment
The real effective exchange rate has remained stable and CGER-type analyses suggest that
The Bahamas’ exchange rate has remained in line with fundamentals. Near-term current
account deficits are high, mainly due to imports for FDI-related projects, but projected to
stabilize over the medium term. The Bahamian dollar remains competitive when compared with
the currencies of other tourism-intensive economies in the Caribbean. Nevertheless, the global
competition is increasing in the tourism industry, and The Bahamas will need to overcome its
specific challenges of high access cost to the Family Islands, inefficient delivery of utilities, and
high dependence on U.S. economy.
Based on the staff’s current account projections, The Bahamas’ exchange rate remains in line
with medium-term fundamentals. The peg to
the U.S. dollar has fostered strong linkages with

Non-price measures suggest room for improving competitiveness. The Bahamas’ standing in
the World Bank’s Doing Business Index (DBI) has weakened—it ranked 77th out of 185 countries in
the 2013 report, down from a ranking of 71st in 2012. The report attributed the lower ranking mainly
to deteriorations in the ease of Starting a Business and Dealing with Construction Permits. The
ranking placed The Bahamas 6th amongst the Caribbean countries surveyed, after St. Lucia, Antigua
and Barbuda, Dominica, Trinidad and Tobago, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines. The Bahamas
visibly underperformed in Registering Property, Enforcing Contracts, and Protecting Investors.

tourism-related FDI.
The Bahamas still needs to face rising competition at the global level, as well as overcome its
specific challenges. Air access to The Bahamas, particularly the Family Islands, is quite expensive,
despite its proximity to the United States. Further, operating expenses for tourist resorts are quite
high, because of their remoteness and the high cost of delivery of utilities, especially electricity. To
mitigate these challenges, policy is focused on promoting tourism in The Bahamas as a high-end,
unique, but differentiated experience, providing support for projects on Nassau and Paradise Island,
redeveloping Grand Bahama Island and repositioning its brand name, and enhancing awareness of
the Family Islands through well-targeted marketing campaigns.

FINANCIAL RELATIONS WITH THE INTER-AMERICAN
DEVELOPMENT BANK
Recent Country Strategy
The current Country Strategy (CS) for 2010–2014 supports the efforts the government of
The Bahamas to increase productivity and growth by improving infrastructure and enhancing
competitiveness of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). The CS priority areas are: energy, water
and sanitation, transport, and SME development. As of October 2012, the Inter-American
Development Bank’s (IADB) sovereign-guaranteed portfolio had an average age of 1.9 years and had
grown from two loans totaling US$113 million in 2010 to eight loans totaling US$333 million. The
envelope of US$195 million was exceeded, primarily due to the need to provide countercyclical
support to the government’s efforts to counteract the economic downturn that was triggered by the
international financial crisis. Private sector support has been provided primarily via four multilateral
investment fund operations, totaling US$852,764.
The technical cooperation portfolio is extensive, with total approvals of US$6.8 million. Most of the
portfolio is in infrastructure (89 percent) that is critical to the tourism industry. Trade accounts for
5 percent of the portfolio, while education and social protection amount to 4 percent and 2 percent,
respectively. Performance indicators have improved over the past three years, mainly due to better
project execution in the road transport subsector.
Based on discussions between the government and the IADB, the bank is in the process of
elaborating a new Country Strategy for the period 2013–2017.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Statistical data are broadly adequate for surveillance purposes, but some weaknesses remain.
The central bank produces annual, quarterly, and monthly reports on macroeconomic developments,
and monetary and fiscal data, and is the main source of economic information. The operations of
public corporations are not compiled into a consolidated set of public sector accounts, although
their debt is included in the public debt data. Thus, a presentation of the general government
accounts, including revenue, expenditure, and overall balance is not available.
During 2009 and 2010, the main focus of the Department of Statistics (DoS) was the preparation and
execution of the 2010 census (carried out every 10 years). It also embarked on a series of initiatives
to improve the national accounts, including rebasing the GDP.
The DoS updated the CPI methodology with technical assistance from CARTAC. The base year was
moved to 2010 from 1995, and additional categories were introduced, with higher weights for some
items, including for transport and communications. At the same time, the coverage was expanded to
include the island of Abaco, in addition to the two islands already covered by the CPI (New
Providence and Grand Bahama).
New export-import price indices (XMPI) for goods and major services were developed with technical
assistance from CARTAC. Procedures for systematic re-sampling and re-weighting were modified in
order to keep the market basket representative of what is being measured. The Bahamas does not
compile data on the country’s international investment position (IIP).
Looking ahead, the main activities of the DoS in the coming years will include producing and
disseminating comprehensive census data and implementing bi-annual labor force surveys.
The Bahamas began participating in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) in 2003. Its
metadata were posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board on February 14, 2003.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
February 12, 2013

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with The Bahamas
On February 4, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with The Bahamas.1
Background
Economic activity grew by about 1½ percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2011, up from
near-zero in 2010, on improved tourism activity and ongoing investment projects, including the large
US$3.5 billion private Baha Mar project. However, unemployment remained high at 16 percent, and
inflation more than doubled to 3 percent, mainly due to higher world oil prices. The fiscal deficit in
FY2011/12 (July to June) is estimated to have increased to about 6 percent of GDP, up from
4½ percent in the previous fiscal year.
Despite higher exports in the wake of the gradual global recovery, the external current account
deficit widened in 2011. This is due to higher imports, which reflect a surge in foreign direct
investment (FDI)-related imports and high world oil prices. At the same time, large FDI and other
private capital inflows helped support gross international reserves, which remained at a modest level
of 2.3 months of imports at end-2011. However, measured in terms of non-FDI imports, reserves
were much higher at about 4.6 months cover. The real effective exchange rate has remained
broadly stable over the past four years.
Looking forward, the outlook foresees stronger growth and a weaker debt position. Real GDP
growth of 2½ percent in 2012 is projected to exceed trend growth (2 percent), driven by strong
tourism and construction activity. Growth could increase further over the medium term if new
projects and trade initiatives materialize. Inflation is likely to stay low—projected at over 2 percent
(year on year) at end-2012—but reducing the high level of unemployment will remain a challenge.
Pressures are projected to continue from a large external current account deficit and a rising
government fiscal deficit. The risks to the outlook, however, are tilted to the downside, given

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

uncertainty about prospects for the U.S. recovery and global food and fuel prices, and, on the
domestic front, about the pace of fiscal consolidation and implementation of structural reforms.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the gradual recovery of The Bahamas economy, supported by a
rebound in tourism and ongoing investment projects. However, unemployment remains high and the
economy faces downside risks from an uncertain external environment, while fiscal and external
imbalances have widened. Directors agreed that the main challenge is to strengthen the fiscal and
external positions, rebuild macroeconomic buffers, and implement policies to enhance medium-term
growth.
Directors emphasized that the key policy priority is to strengthen public finances. They
acknowledged the need to balance fiscal consolidation with efforts to support growth and
employment. At the same time, they noted that delayed fiscal consolidation could pose risks to
long-term debt and external sustainability. Directors, therefore, encouraged the authorities to
embark on a credible medium-term strategy to strengthen revenue mobilization and improve tax
administration, rationalize expenditure, and place public enterprises on a sound financial footing.
Directors agreed that the fixed exchange rate regime continues to serve the country well. They
noted the staff’s assessment that the level of the exchange rate remains broadly in line with
medium-term macroeconomic fundamentals. Nonetheless, there is room to improve non-price
competitiveness and build up buffers. In this regard, Directors welcomed the authorities’
commitment to boost foreign exchange reserves and to strengthen competitiveness and the external
position.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ growth strategy, and looked forward to sustained
implementation. They emphasized the importance of measures to improve the business
environment, develop infrastructure, enhance human capital, and promote economic diversification.
Directors welcomed the finding of the Financial Sector Stability Assessment that there are no
immediate threats to financial stability. Stress tests indicate that the onshore banks can withstand
severe shocks to solvency and liquidity. Directors encouraged the authorities to strengthen the
monitoring of credit risk in light of high nonperforming loan ratios. They noted that financial system
oversight has strengthened, and encouraged the authorities to compile and disseminate more
information regarding the offshore financial sector. They looked forward to continued improvements
in the crisis management and financial safety net framework.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Thomas Hockin, Executive Director for The Bahamas
and Carlos Alberto de Resende, Alternate Executive Director
February 4, 2013
On behalf of our Bahamian authorities, we continue to appreciate the policy discussions
with the Fund. We welcome the thorough and balanced assessment of the country’s
economic situation and financial system made by the Article IV and FSAP mission. We
are particularly satisfied with the recognition of the country’s strong bank supervision
framework and that risks to financial stability are minimal.
Although we broadly agree with the staff’s assessment of the medium-term challenges
facing the authorities, we emphasize the need for a balanced approach between fiscal
sustainability and policies to foster inclusive growth and diversification of the economy.
This is particularly important in light of the high unemployment rate and the high-cost
infrastructural development that is typical of economies based in geographically
dispersed archipelagos, such as The Bahamas.
The report outlines a sensible set of policy options, mostly in tune with initiatives already
being implemented or in the process of being implemented by the authorities, such as the
tax and public financial management reforms.
The Economic Environment
The Bahamian economy continues to recover from the weak global environment on
account of a rebound in tourism and, mainly, large domestic investment projects. These
large projects are not only sustaining aggregate demand in the short run, but will also
boost the tourism productive capacity and increase job opportunities. These factors, in
combination with the broad government’s strategy for growth (outlined below), are
expected to generate positive spillovers to other sectors.
Despite the increase in 2011, inflation has been under control -- in line with trends in the
major trading partners --, allowing monetary policy to remain supportive. Although the
current account remains in deficit, reflecting FDI-related imports, more than 90 percent
of the negative balance is financed by non-debt creating capital inflows, implying that the
overall balance of payments does not pose immediate risks to the country. Accordingly,
despite some reduction in 2012, the level of reserves remains adequate when measured in
terms of non-FDI imports and other standard metrics, and the real exchange rate is in line
with fundamentals.
However, partially as a result of: the supportive initiatives in response to the global crisis,
the slow economic activity, and higher capital expenditures, fiscal strains are expected to
persist for longer and the public debt is trending upward. Although authorities are
mindful of these challenges and are committed to discipline, they note that the taxable
base of economic activities will increase notably once the large-scale tourism
developments become fully operational and the global economy improves.

2
Fiscal Policies
The authorities’ medium-term fiscal objective remains focused on rebuilding the buffers
that allowed the effective countercyclical policy response to the global recession.
However, given an external environment that is still uncertain, the very high level of
unemployment, and the infrastructure needs, the authorities are careful not to undermine
the flexibility of fiscal operations. Differently from staff, the authorities do not yet see the
current fiscal imbalances as a drag to growth and, therefore, do not think that a heavily
frontloaded fiscal consolidation is needed at this juncture. Nevertheless, they are
committed to an eventual return to a lower level of government sector debt-to-GDP ratio,
whereby a combination of sustained economic growth and primary surpluses will be
needed. The authorities agree that improving revenue yields from overall economic
activity is paramount to consolidation and are currently discussing possible avenues for
structural changes in the tax system, as well as working to further enhance tax
administration though strengthening both compliance and enforcement and improving
public finance management. In this regard, a white paper on tax reform has been
approved at the policy level and will be released shortly, moving to the stage of public
consultation. An important part of the envisaged tax reform is the introduction of a Value
Added Tax (VAT). In addition, work is already underway to implement the Central
Revenue Authority (CRA), which will consolidate tax collection functions performed by
several separate agents and increase the overall efficiency of tax administration. Other
initiatives include: the e-government portal, which is increasing the scope for efficient
interaction with tax payers; measures being taken since 2011 to improve customs
collection (the largest single revenue component); more risk-based and non-discretionary
frameworks to strengthen collections; and significant efforts to increase real property tax
compliance. The authorities are also working to further streamline tax concessions and
will explore how best to achieve this, guided by IMF and IDB Technical Assistance. All
tax and revenue collection initiatives being discussed, however, take into account their
possible effects on the country’s relative appeal to attract FDI.
Regarding state-owned enterprises (SOEs), the authorities note the challenges associated
with providing uniform and affordable services to all islands in the archipelago, given the
high cost and low scope for economies of scale. They agree with the continuous need for
improving efficiency and transparency of operations, not only to minimize the budget
implications of SOE’s but to increase overall productivity of the countries’ production
factors and reduce production costs in the economy. In light of these goals, current
operations of SOEs are fully monitored and subject to independent external audits, which
must be annually reported to Parliament. The authorities’ general guiding principle
regarding SOEs is the need for more discipline and good corporate practices to cope with
less automatic and direct support from the central government. The reform recently
implemented in the Water and Sewerage Company (WSC) is a clear example of the
authorities’ commitment to best governance practices in public enterprises.

3
Monetary and Financial Sector Policies
Monetary policy remains effective in ensuring sustainable domestic credit trends and
maintaining the fixed exchange rate, which have been instrumental in reducing
uncertainty to foreign investors and providing a credible nominal anchor. Credit
expansion is moderate and is not projected to accelerate considerably in the near term due
to both supply- and demand-side considerations. Macro-prudential measures to manage
credit expansion will continue to be geared towards improving asset quality within the
banking system. In line with the goal of rebuilding buffers, the CBOB will continue to
ensure that credit trends are consistent with an adequate evolution of foreign reserves
over the medium term.
The authorities are pleased with the results from the recent FSSA. They particularly note
the Fund’s acknowledgment of the substantial progress made in strengthening The
Bahamas’ financial sector regulatory infrastructure, including the insurance sector. They
also welcome the Fund’s positive assessment of the resilience of both onshore and
offshore financial sectors to a wide range of shocks, the limited risk of spillovers between
them, and the overall conclusion that the country faces no immediate risk to financial
stability. Despite the Fund’s recognition of the authorities’ successful approach to
financial stability, the FSAP also provides further basis for improvement.
Although well capitalized, profitable, and liquid, the banking system shows relatively
high ratios of non-performing loans (NPL). The authorities are convinced that the
effective framework put in place to oversee the financial system, with the close
monitoring by authorities of the trends in NPL, is able to flag and anticipate any potential
negative effects of NPLs on the capital adequacy of the banking system. Moreover, the
stricter capital adequacy standards and limits to both household leverage and exposure to
foreign exchange risks introduced since the start of the global financial crisis are
important mitigating factors to NPL and similar indebtedness-related risks.
Other initiatives, such as the National Financial Crisis Management Plan, a risk-based
approach to the supervision of both onshore and offshore operations, a framework for
regulation and supervision of credit unions, and efforts to further clarify the rules
governing the Deposit Insurance Corporation, have been or are being implemented with
the objective of improving the financial stability safety network in the country. With
regard to improving the regulatory framework for the insurance sector and securities, the
authorities also envisage substantial progress over the medium term, coinciding with the
recommendations of the FSAP mission.
Growth Strategies
The Bahamian authorities are mindful of the challenges they face to boost potential
growth amidst a tight fiscal situation, headwinds from the global economy, and the
unavoidable geographic constraints. The strategy continues to be broadly focused on
boosting the medium-term growth potential while developing a more resilient and
diversified economic base that exploits the potential synergies that exist between the

4
main economic activities – financial services and tourism – and other sectors, including a
wide range of professional services (legal, consultants, etc.), agribusiness, manufacturing,
and craft and artistic industries. The authorities are very focused on fulfilling the
necessary steps for WTO accession and to improve on their records regarding indicators
of a business-friendly environment: an aggressive policy towards reducing crime, swift
administration of justice, better corporate legislation, and protection of intellectual
property rights. All these initiatives have important implications not only for the
flourishing of new domestic business opportunities, but are also geared towards
enhancing the already established comparative advantage the country has to attract FDI.
Investments in public infrastructure and education, continued emphasis on labor force
productivity, and work force training are important complements to this strategy.
Conclusion
Our Bahamian authorities remain vigilant to the uncertain external environment and are
committed to maintaining appropriately timed and disciplined fiscal policies, as more
permanent reforms to tax revenues and public financial management are implemented.
The goal is to return public debt to a downward trend, while policies to diversify and
strengthen economic growth potential and reduce the high unemployment rate are
carefully put in place. Initiatives to continue the successful approach to stability in the
financial sector will also be upheld.
