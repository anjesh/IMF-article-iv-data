Executive Summary


Context and recent developments. Following near zero growth in 2009, economic
activity is expected to pick up in 2010, supported by accommodative monetary and fiscal
policies and a sound financial system. Key short term challenges include containing
second-round effects on inflation from anticipated supply shocks, as well as mitigating
the effects of a possible surge in capital inflows. A strong institutional policy framework
bodes well for sustained growth and low inflation in the medium term.



Key policy recommendations:
o Near-term policy stance. Monetary and fiscal policies should protect the nascent
recovery. A tightening of the policy stance should await stronger evidence that the
recovery is self-sustained.
o Capital flows. The exchange rate should continue to be the main shock absorber in
the event of a surge in capital inflows. If the recovery is firm, fiscal tightening should
also be considered.
o Reserve coverage. While the current level of reserves is broadly adequate, there is
scope to increase coverage as the balance of payments strengthens.
o Fiscal consolidation. While the fiscal position is not weak, lower levels of debt would
help protect against risks, and improve prospects of regaining investment grade.
o Fiscal rule. Setting a target on a “broad” structural balance (including the central and
regional governments) would establish a clear link to public debt and ensure
consistency between the stances of the different levels of government.



Authorities’ views: The authorities concur with staff’s advice on the policy stance for
2010; and on the key role of exchange rate flexibility to absorb external shocks. They
regard their reserve levels as adequate, but agree that higher levels would be desirable if
conditions allow. They consider their medium term debt targets as reasonably ambitious,
but agree that lower debt levels would provide more space to deal with contingent risks.
They see the benefits of a fiscal rule applicable to a broad aggregate, but tend to favor a
central government rule that is more under their control.

I. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
1.
Colombia was not affected too severely by the global crisis. The economy had
begun to slow down in early 2008, as policies had been tightened to address overheating, but
the global crisis caused private investment to collapse in the last quarter of 2008 (Figure 1).
Domestic demand began recovering in the second quarter of 2009, led by public investment
and consumption. For the year as a whole, real GDP growth was about zero. With near zero
food price inflation and an output gap of about 2 percent at end-2009, end-year inflation fell
to 2 percent from 7.7 percent at end-2008, well below the official inflation target range of
4½−5 ½ percent.

The overall reserves position remained broadly stable during 2009. The peso
depreciated sharply in the first quarter of 2009 but recovered fairly quickly and, by mid-June,
was above pre-Lehman levels. With only moderate intervention, central bank net
international reserves (excluding the SDR allocation) remained broadly constant at the end2008 level of US$24 billion.1 Weak exports and workers’ remittances were more than offset
by a fall in imports and, as a result, the external current account deficit narrowed to
1.8 percent of GDP (from 2.9 percent the previous year). The capital account surplus
declined only moderately, as a sharp increase in public inflows (up by US$8.4 billion)
compensated for lower private inflows. Rollover rates of private external debt only declined
moderately and the US$10.9 billion in contingent reserves from the FCL approved in
May 2009 were not used.

1

In October 2009, the authorities decided to keep abroad resources from the placement of external bonds (of
about US$2.6 billion) to mitigate appreciation pressures.

Monetary transmission (banking channel)

3.
Monetary policy responded swiftly.
Since late 2008 the policy rate was lowered
by 650 basis points (to 3½ percent). Bank
lending rates fell, but credit to the private
sector decelerated sharply (to about 1 percent
growth at end-2009). Corporates took
advantage of the low interest rate
environment by making sizable placements
of domestic bonds in 2009 (US$11 billion,
twice the level of 2008).

Fiscal policy also contributed to support demand. The overall fiscal deficit rose
from broad balance in 2008 to 2.8 percent of GDP in 2009, providing more stimulus than the
one anticipated in the budget (mainly due to lower-than-budgeted tax revenues).2 The
structural deficit3 deteriorated from 1.2 percent of GDP in 2008 to 2.2 percent of GDP in
2009, imparting a fiscal impulse of about 1 percent of GDP. Total revenues remained broadly
constant in real terms, as oil revenues (based on 2008 profits) compensated for weak
proceeds from the VAT and international trade.4 Meanwhile, total spending (adjusting for
fuel subsidies) grew by 7 percent in real terms, with capital expenditure—which has
important multiplier effects—increasing by 25 percent in real terms, as regional governments
made up for budget under-spending in 2008.

A better measure of the change in the fiscal position would exclude from the 2009 expenditures oil subsidies
received by consumers during 2008 but recorded in the 2009 budget. With this one-off adjustment, the overall
fiscal deficit would increase from 1 percent of GDP in 2008 to 1.8 percent of GDP in 2009.

The structural fiscal balance adjusts for the output gap, future oil prices, the timing of fuel subsidies, and oneoff pension-related revenues in 2009.

Transfers of dividends from Ecopetrol (89 percent government-owned) to the government take place with a
lag of one year (i.e., are based on profits of the previous year).

7
5.
Government foreign borrowing increased preemptively. With sound
fundamentals, supported by the FCL, Colombia had uninterrupted access to capital markets
at favorable rates, and considerable space for countercyclical policies. Gross official external
borrowing exceeded US$6 billion in 2009 (compared with US$3.2 billion in 2008) with
sovereign bond placements totaling US$3.5 billion. In net terms, official external borrowing
rose to 2 percent of GDP, and the government was able to increase its deposits abroad by
about 1.4 percent of GDP.

6.
Financial soundness indicators remained solid, despite the global shocks and the
downturn in activity. The largely domestically-owned and locally-financed financial system
did not experience major strains from the global crisis. Colombian banks did not have
complex off-balance sheet financial instruments, and had limited cross-border linkages.
Liquidity indicators improved as credit demand slowed and banks increased their holdings of
government securities (the ratio of liquid to total assets increased by about 3¾ percentage
points). Capital adequacy remained strong, and valuation gains helped maintain profits high
(Figure 3). NPL indicators reached 4½ percent in mid-2009 but declined to 4.1 percent by the
end of the year, backed by high provisions. The corporate sector’s strong balance sheets and
the moderate levels of household debt also helped avoid financial distress.
7.
Measures taken since late 2008 also contributed to financial sector resilience. At
end-2008, banks reached agreement with the superintendent to retain a portion of their 2008
profits, increasing their capital adequacy ratio from 13.4 to around 15 percent. In early 2009,
the authorities raised the effective coverage of the deposit insurance, improved risk-based
deposit insurance premia, and introduced a new liquidity risk management system. In
July 2009, Congress approved a financial sector law increasing flexibility in pension funds’
investment portfolios (with effect in September 2010) and enhancing consumer protection
and financial education. In September 2009, it was decided that countercyclical provisioning
would be more rules-based and bank-specific starting in April 2010.

II. MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK
8.
The electoral calendar of 2010 is not expected to weaken Colombia’s solid policy
framework. Congressional elections were held in March, and presidential elections are
scheduled for May with a second round, if necessary, for June. The new government will
take office in August. Colombia’s strong institutions and broad domestic consensus for
economic stability bodes well for the continuation of sound policies under the next
government.
9.

The outlook for 2010 and the medium term is generally positive.


Economic growth is expected to pick up gradually. Real GDP growth in 2010
is projected at about 2¼ percent, reflecting the upturn in the world economy and
the impact of the expansionary policies

and thereafter settle at 4½ percent.



Inflation is likely to remain within the central bank target range. Inflation
expectations indicators in early 2010 suggest that end-year inflation may be
around 3.8 percent, near the top of the target range. However, the effects of El
Niño on food inflation are likely to be offset by the output gap and peso
appreciation. Over the medium-term, inflation is expected to remain well within
the target range of 2–4 percent.



The external current account deficit is expected to narrow over the medium
term. The combination of lower exports to Venezuela and an envisaged increase
in oil investment-related imports are projected to widen the external current
account deficit to 3.1 percent of GDP in 2010. The bulk of the deficit would be
financed by FDI, with other private flows also expected to recover. Over the
medium term, the current account deficit is expected to decline to about 1 percent
of GDP, driven by higher exports (including from the expected increase in oil

In July 2009, Venezuela began a process of closing most border trade with Colombia, reducing imports during
the last quarter of the year to US$535 million, about one quarter of its previous levels (Colombia’s exports to
Venezuela, mostly manufactures and beef, amounted to US$2 billion in the last quarter of 2007).

The overall fiscal deficit would continue rising in 2010, but start declining in
2011. Staff updated the authorities’ medium-term fiscal framework (MTFF), published in
mid-2009, with the revised 2010 budget, the latest WEO assumptions, an improved outlook
for oil production, and higher spending in roads and health care. The updated projection
shows a combined public sector deficit of 3.5 percent of GDP in 2010, and a gradual decline
thereafter to levels around 1½ percent of GDP.7 This fiscal consolidation would bring the
public debt to GDP ratio to about 32 percent by 2014-15 (similar to the end-2008 level).

1/ Include adjustments for the output gap, oil price expectations, fuel subsidies, and one-off pension-related revenues in 2009.

Ecopetrol (treated as public sector in the balance of payments and debt statistics) is carrying out substantial
investments. It projects that oil and gas production by the company and its associates would double from 2009
to 2015 (from 500 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) per day in 2009 to 1 million BOE per day in 2015).

7

Given prospects for higher oil production and the related revenues, the structural overall deficit would decline
from 2.3 percent of GDP in 2010 to about 1.5 percent of GDP in 2015; the improvement at the central
government level would be larger.

11
11.
Risks to the growth outlook are broadly balanced. While the baseline scenario
assumes an important increase in oil production over the medium term, there is significant
upside potential in the oil sector. This could result in significant higher oil production, and
overall output, over the medium to long term. Key downside risks to growth include the
uncertainty surrounding the strength of the global recovery, and increased political tensions
with Venezuela, which could have a larger and more protracted adverse impact on activity.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
12.
Discussions centered on the appropriate policy stance during 2010 and possible
improvements to the policy framework. In particular, the discussions covered (a) the
policy mix to protect the nascent economic recovery; and (b) measures to further strengthen
the medium term policy framework, including through the adoption of a structural fiscal rule,
and other policies to contain downside fiscal risks. Discussions also assessed the strength of
the financial sector following the global crisis.
Near term policy stance
13.
There was agreement that macroeconomic policies should remain supportive
until there is firm evidence that the recovery is self-sustained. Avoiding an early
withdrawal of stimulus would be especially important in light of the dampening effect on
2010 growth of the trade disruptions with Venezuela.
14.
Staff agreed that the current stance of monetary policy remained appropriate,
and that a premature tightening cycle ought to be avoided. Staff noted that the significant
easing of monetary conditions in 2009 had supported domestic demand without endangering
the inflation objective, and that monetary policy lags would continue providing support
during 2010. In addition, it noted that the rise in inflation in 2010 would be driven by supply
factors and should not call for an immediate policy response. There was agreement, however,
that with short and medium term inflation expectations near the top of the target range, the
central bank should remain vigilant and stand ready to tighten at the first signs of domestic
demand pressures. In this regard, staff noted that it would be important to monitor closely the
effects of higher food prices on inflation expectations.
15.
The fiscal stance envisaged for 2010 strikes a reasonable balance between
supporting domestic demand and safeguarding medium term sustainability. Given
weaknesses on the revenue side, linked both to cyclical and noncyclical factors, staff
welcomed the spending cuts of 0.7 percent of GDP adopted in early 2010 to prevent a further
widening of the deficit. With these measures, the structural fiscal balance would remain
broadly at the same level as in 2009.
16.
It would be advisable to consider possible responses to a surge in private capital
inflows. The authorities’ baseline scenario assumes that non-FDI outflows in 2010 would be
only slightly lower than those observed in 2009, although they acknowledge that improved

12
domestic investment opportunities and low global interest rates could induce larger gross
inflows. They considered that, in such a scenario, exchange rate flexibility would continue to
be the first line of defense, possibly supported by rules-based intervention to smooth
volatility. The authorities agreed that macroeconomic policies could play an important role in
moderating capital inflows, including through some fiscal tightening once the recovery is on
more solid footing. While not contemplating capital controls at the time, the authorities
indicated that they could be an option if warranted by the type and size of foreign inflows.
Staff noted that, in general, the effectiveness of controls is rather limited as a permanent
measure, although they could be useful to manage a temporary surge in capital flows.8
Strengthening the policy framework
17.
Although the medium term outlook was seen as positive, there was agreement
that policies should aim at reducing downside risks. Prudent macroeconomic policies, a
sound financial system, and limited vulnerabilities bode well for the economy. However,
there are important risks stemming from external conditions (including the strength of the
global recovery and relations with Venezuela) and domestic uncertainties, particularly on the
fiscal side.
Fiscal Policy
Staff discussed the implications of the updated global outlook for the authorities’
medium-term fiscal framework. Although the authorities had not formally revised their
medium term fiscal framework, they recognized that external conditions had significantly
improved since the publication of the current framework in June 2009. In particular, fiscal
revenues are now expected to benefit from sizable increases in oil production. At the same
time, however, key expenditure risks have materialized, particularly on health as a result of
court-mandated decisions. It was agreed that these factors would likely result in higher fiscal
deficits and public debt levels than those envisaged during the 2008 Article IV consultation.
18.

More ambitious medium term fiscal targets would be beneficial. Although oilrelated revenues will be higher than previously envisaged, public debt is projected to be
8 percentage points of GDP above the medium term level suggested as a target during the
2008 Article IV consultation. Staff argued that, while the overall debt level remains
moderate, lower medium term debt levels were feasible and would create fiscal space to
absorb fiscal risks if these were to materialize. In addition, they would likely improve the
prospects for an upgrade from credit rating agencies (Box 1). The authorities agreed that the
country would benefit from lower debt levels, but stressed that the envisaged fiscal stance
ensures debt sustainability.

19.

8

The authorities imposed capital controls on non-FDI flows in mid-2007, mainly in the form of unremunerated
reserve requirements. The controls were removed in October 2008.

13
20.
Staff supported the authorities’ plans to adopt a fiscal rule. It noted that Colombia
is a good candidate for adopting a fiscal rule owing to its moderate public debt and strong
fiscal institutions, including an effective fiscal responsibility law, a medium term fiscal
framework, and budget rules for regional governments. A fiscal rule would help signal more
firmly the commitment to fiscal consolidation, and facilitate the use of countercyclical
policies to limit the impact of exogenous shocks on the economy. In addition, a rule could be
useful to shield the economy from the volatility in oil receipts. Staff stressed, however, that a
fiscal rule would not be effective to prevent an equilibrium exchange rate appreciation.
21.

Staff recommended that Colombia’s fiscal rule:


Targets a broad structural fiscal balance (including the central and subnational
governments). Staff noted that such a target would provide a clear link to overall
public debt and ensure consistency between the fiscal stances of the central and
subnational governments. While recognizing the advantages of a broad aggregate, the
authorities indicated that that they are currently considering all options, including a
central government target that would be easier to control.



Aims at a significant decline in public debt. Staff argued that adopting a formal
framework to reduce the public debt ratio in a five-year period to the level reached
prior to the global crisis (32 percent of GDP) may represent somewhat of a missed
opportunity. It noted that a more ambitious target9 would send a powerful signal of
Colombia’s commitment to fiscal prudence and debt sustainability. The authorities
agreed that the fiscal rule ought to be consistent with an ambitious decline in public
debt levels.

22.
Staff acknowledged that an ambitious medium term debt target may require a
phased adoption of the fiscal rule. A rule that targets a zero structural balance for the
combined public sector starting in, say, 2011 would require a fiscal adjustment of about
2 percent of GDP in the first year of operation. Staff recognized that an upfront adjustment of
this magnitude may not be warranted, and would entail risks for aggregate demand.
Considering this, it was agreed that a phased implementation of the fiscal rule could be based
on a less ambitious target for a transitional period (e.g., a structural deficit of about
¾−1 percent of GDP for two to three years) while announcing that a more ambitious target
would be adopted at a specific date (e.g. zero structural overall balance by 2013).

9

A zero structural balance target for the combined public sector starting in 2011 would lower the public debt
ratio to about 22 percent of GDP by end 2015, which is broadly the debt level that was suggested as a medium
term target prior to the global crisis.

14
Box 1. Debt Levels and Sovereign Debt Ratings
Colombia’s sovereign debt had an investment grade rating from international rating agencies during 1995–98. Its
downgrade to below-investment status was one of the fallouts from the 1998–99 financial crisis. Fiscal
consolidation efforts during the 2000s have lowered Colombia’s public debt from 50 percent of GDP at end-2002
to 32 percent of GDP at end-2008. Notwithstanding increased government borrowing during 2009, Colombia’s
current public debt to GDP ratio is broadly similar to those of emerging markets whose sovereign debt is rated as
investment grade (see chart).

The level of public debt, however, is only one of several indicators used by rating agencies to assess country risk.
An analysis of panel data from 48 emerging markets made by staff finds that, in addition to public debt levels,
rating agencies attach significant weight to three other factors when assessing country risk: the size of the export
sector, the depth of the financial system, and political risk.
These findings suggest that Colombia’s efforts toward regaining investment grade status should focus on reducing
further its public debt level. A significant decline in public debt rates could allow Colombia to compensate for its
relative disadvantages (compared to other
emerging economies) in the other, more
“structural” factors considered by rating
agencies in their assessments.
Prospects for a future reduction in Colombia’s
debt levels are favorable. Results from a debt
simulation model suggest that there is a fifty
percent probability that, by 2015, Colombia’s
public debt to GDP ratio will be below the
level it had prior to the global crisis in 2008
(32 percent of GDP); and only a 25 percent
probability that it will exceed 40 percent of
GDP. The likely adoption of an explicit fiscal
rule, and the overall debt targets associated
with it, also bodes well for progress in fiscal
consolidation and public debt reduction in the
coming years.

15
Box 2. Alternative Fiscal Rules for Colombia
Staff analyzed the implications of several types of fiscal rules on debt levels, the scope for countercyclical
policies, and the expenditure path. As point of reference, staff used the authorities’ 2009 medium term fiscal
framework with updated assumptions (see paragraph 10). In all scenarios, except where noted otherwise, the
structural fiscal balance includes adjustments for the output gap, future oil prices, the timing of fuel subsidies, and
one-off pension-related revenues in 2009. The scenarios assumed that the fiscal rule would be in place starting in
2011. The main results of three scenarios are summarized below:


A zero overall balance for the combined public sector. Adoption of this rule would lower the debt ratio to
about 22 percent of GDP by 2015, almost 10 percent of GDP below the baseline scenario. To achieve this
target, however, measures equivalent to about 2 percent of GDP would need to be adopted in the first year
(2011). If this adjustment were achieved only through expenditure cuts, it would imply a reduction in real
government spending of about 2.6 percent in 2011, which would be followed by 6 percent real growth in
2012. A zero balance rule would be easy to communicate, and ensure consistency between the regional and
central governments.



A nonoil deficit for the combined public sector of 3.5 percent of GDP. Under this rule, debt would
decline to about 25 percent of GDP by 2015, significantly lower than in the baseline. With no revenue
measures, this rule would entail a reduction in expenditure of about 1.3 percent of GDP in 2011 with respect
to the baseline. However, if oil prices and production were lower than in the baseline, overall deficits and
debt would rise.



Primary surplus for the central government of 1 percent of GDP. This rule would also reduce public
sector debt to 25 percent of GDP. Upfront measures of about 1.6 percent of GDP would be needed to reach
the target in 2011. Compared to rules applicable to a broader fiscal aggregate, this one would be more
directly under the control of the government. However, under this rule local governments could adopt a
stance that undermines the intended effect of fiscal policy on domestic demand and overall public debt.

A transition period for the fiscal rule based on a two-step approach would avoid a sharp upfront adjustment.
If the rule of a zero overall balance for the combined public sector were implemented fully after a three year
transition period with a deficit of 1 percent of GDP, the implied adjustment for 2011 would be 1 percentage point of
GDP and the debt would decline to 25 percent of GDP by 2015. A similar transition period could be adopted for the
central government structural primary surplus rule. In that case, a three year period with a primary surplus target of
0.5 percent of GDP would require an adjustment of 1 percent of GDP, and would lower public debt to 27 percent of
GDP by 2015.

Staff encouraged the authorities to address two major sources of medium term
fiscal vulnerabilities.


Risks arising from special regimes and tax incentives for investment.10 Staff
cautioned that continued increases in the number of beneficiaries of special tax
regimes would lead to a significant erosion of the tax base. The authorities were of
the view that the positive impact of the incentives on new investment had so far
outweighed their costs, but reiterated their readiness to reconsider the need for and
scope of these incentives. For example, they noted that the tax reform approved at
end-2009 had helped limit tax benefits by reducing the income tax deduction of
fixed-asset investments from 40 percent to 30 percent, and eliminating the
possibility of combining the income tax deduction with the special free trade zone
regime.



Risk from social security expenditure, in particular higher health care costs. Staff
welcomed the decision to incorporate explicit assumptions of higher health care
costs (estimated at 0.9 percent of GDP, starting in 2011), but argued that these fiscal
contingencies remained large and uncertain. The authorities noted their
commitment to continue to work to reduce the impact of these outlays on the
deficit, as evidenced by recent steps taken in January 2010 to set up a
comprehensive framework to restrain the increase in health costs, identify new
revenues (0.2 percent of GDP), and reallocate existing resources (0.2 percent of
GDP).

24.
A more systematic approach to detect and respond to fiscal contingencies would
be advisable. Concretely, staff recommended giving a more forward looking orientation to
the assessment of contingences in the medium term fiscal framework. For example, the
analysis could be expanded from the current assessment of the costs of tax exemptions for
the year in question, to a multi-year assessment of potential costs. Staff also stressed the need
to identify contingency measures that would be adopted if those risks materialized.
25.
There remains scope for improving the efficiency of the tax system and reducing
expenditure rigidities. In line with previous Fund recommendations, staff suggested
simplifying the tax system (by broadening the VAT base and reducing the number of rates),
and phasing out the financial transaction tax. It argued that a more efficient tax system would
facilitate compliance with the targets set under a fiscal rule. Staff noted that expenditure
rigidities remain high and constrain the country’s ability to prioritize high impact spending,
especially under a fiscal rule. The authorities agreed that a tax reform would be beneficial
and noted that spending rigidities are expected to decline gradually as a result of previous
reforms.

10

Investment incentives include an income tax deduction of 30 percent from fixed-asset investments, a regime
of special free trade zones (not location specific) with a 15 percent income tax rate, and stability contracts that
guarantee no changes in direct taxes for up to 20 years.

17
Monetary policy framework
26.
The recent adoption of an inflation target range for 2010, in line with the long
term objective of 2–4 percent is welcome. This measure will help lock in the gains of the
sharp drop in inflation in 2009 and strengthen the inflation targeting framework. Staff
encouraged the authorities to discontinue making reference to annual and medium-term
targets for inflation in favor of a single, permanent target. The authorities saw merit in this
proposal but noted that such change would require amending the central bank law, a step they
are not considering at the moment. However, the authorities agreed to emphasize in their
communication strategy that the near-term and long-term target ranges are expected to
remain the same.
External sector
27.
Colombia’s solid policy framework
and reduced balance sheet risks helped
mitigate the impact of the global crisis. The
capital account shocks of the late 1990s had a
severe impact on economic performance due
to large unhedged exposures of the private
sector and a rigid exchange rate regime. There
was agreement that the strengthening of the
policy framework over the last decade made
those channels significantly less important.

Higher reserve levels may help lessen remaining external vulnerabilities. The
authorities considered that the current level of reserves is broadly adequate for “normal”
times and that the FCL had served them well during the global crisis. They acknowledged,
however, that higher reserve levels would be desirable as additional protection against large
shocks. In this connection, staff noted that the authorities could take advantage of the
projected strengthening of the balance of payments to gradually build reserves. The
authorities agreed in principle, emphasizing that they would make sure that any intervention
to build reserves is carried out transparently and is fully consistent with exchange rate
flexibility and the monetary policy objectives.11

There have been no changes in
Colombia’s exchange restrictions since the
last Article IV consultation. Colombia
maintains two exchange measures subject to
Fund approval under Article VIII: (1) a multiple
currency practice and an exchange restriction
arising from a tax on outward remittances of
nonresident profits earned before 2007 and that
have been retained in the country for less than
five years; and (2) an exchange restriction

There was agreement that the real
exchange rate was broadly in equilibrium.
Staff’s updates of the macrobalance and external
stability approaches point to a moderate
undervaluation within the margin of error. These
results are in line with a gradual strengthening
of the external current account balance expected
over the medium term as a result of higher oil
production and exports, as well as stronger
nontraditional exports.12 Moreover, given the
large investments in exploration in recent years,
there is further upside potential for oil
production and exports that would tend to
appreciate the equilibrium real exchange rate
over the medium term.

11

On March 3, the central bank announced that it would start a program of US$20 million of daily purchases of
foreign exchange for the first half of the year (i.e., cumulative purchases of US$1.6 billion for the whole
period). The central bank cited the rapid strengthening of the peso as the key reason for adopting the
intervention strategy.

12

The equilibrium exchange rate approach points to overvaluation. However, the variables used in that
approach do not capture the impact of the expected increases in productivity in the tradeable sector.

20
arising from the special regime for the hydrocarbon sector, in which branches of foreign
corporations are required to either surrender their export proceeds or agree to a government
limitation on their access to the foreign exchange market. Staff noted that it would
recommend approval of the first measure (given that it is of a temporary nature, maintained
for balance of payments reasons, and non-discriminatory in application), and encouraged the
authorities to set a timetable for the removal of the second.
Financial system
31.
Colombia’s strong financial system will help sustain a rapid credit recovery. The
system’s relative strength, particularly compared to other emerging markets, should allow
banks to satisfy any prospective increase in credit demand, and bodes well for higher output
growth (Figure 5). Stress tests conducted in late 2009 suggest that banks remain resilient and
strengthened further following the crisis. NPLs increased modestly during 2009 but
commercial loan portfolios need continued monitoring. Banks’ exposure to market risk also
increased, owing to their increased holdings of government paper, which could affect
profitability when the monetary tightening cycle starts.
32.
There has been further progress in capital market development, financial
regulation and safety nets. A financial reform law approved on July 15, 2009, broadened
the range of permissible assets in repo operations (to facilitate provision of liquidity support
by the central bank), introduced greater investment strategy options for pension funds, and
opened the doors for foreign issuers in the domestic stock exchange. There were also
improvements in the OTC market infrastructure and in the regulation for collective
investment vehicles. In addition, a new liquidity risk management system was adopted, the
coverage of deposit insurance was broadened, and bank resolution procedures were
improved.
33.
Staff welcomed recent regulatory changes for banks’ provisions, though noted
that shortcomings remain (Box 3). The new regulations introduced a rules-based
determination of the phase of the cycle, on a bank-specific basis (taking into account
delinquency rates and the financial strength of individual banks) rather than the system. Staff
noted, however, that the regulation is complex compared to those adopted in other countries,
and may not be too effective at reducing pro-cyclicality.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
34.
With strong policy and institutional frameworks, the global crisis did not have
too severe effects on Colombia’s economy. The slowdown in activity preceded the crisis as
policies had been tightened in 2008 to correct an overheated economy. This, together with a
solid policy framework, a sound financial system, and limited trade linkages mitigated the
effect of the global crisis on output growth in 2009. The rebound in output in 2010 is not
likely to be strong, however, in part due to the full-year effect of trade disruptions with
Venezuela.

Box 3. Reducing the Procyclicality of Prudential Regulations
The Colombian authorities have been ahead of most countries in implementing countercyclical
prudential regulations, a pillar of the ongoing global financial reforms. In mid-2007, they
adopted dynamic provisioning for commercial loans and, in mid-2008, they extended it to consumer
loans. The new systems aimed at accumulating provisions during the upcycle, on the basis of throughthe-cycle expected losses. Moreover, in late 2008, in agreement with the supervisory authorities,
banks were encouraged to retain a large share of profits from 2008 (1.4 percent of risk-weighted
assets) as an additional capital buffer to absorb potential losses related to the global slowdown.
In September 2009, the system of dynamic provisioning was strengthened. The system had been
criticized for providing too much discretion to the supervisor in determining the cycle, and for not
providing enough flexibility to the banks to reallocate provisions across loans. Countercyclical
provisions—which are not taxed—had been designed to cover losses only of the loans against which
they were accumulated, given that provisions accumulated for general loan loss coverage are taxed.
The changes implemented (with effect as of April 2010) introduced a rules-based determination of the
phase of the cycle, on a bank-specific basis—taking into account delinquency rates and the financial
strength of individual banks—rather than the banking system. The changes provide the banks with a
possibility to lower the countercyclical provisions in bad times by a proportion (40 percent) of the
procyclical provisions.
Further enhancements should be considered. The recent changes strike a balance between reducing
systemic credit risk and accommodating the use of provisions by financial institutions. Nonetheless,
the countercyclical provisioning rules are still more complex than those adopted by other countries—
such as Spain, often seen as a benchmark for countercyclical regulations. The countercyclical effect
of the provisions is also dampened by the requirement to comply with a set of stringent indicators, as
well as the fact that the accumulation of the procyclical component of provisions increases in bad
times due to greater expected losses. Moving toward a countercyclical rule for provisions that could
be reallocated freely across loans would be desirable, although such a step would require deciding the
future treatment of the outstanding stock of countercyclical provisions, as well as the tax treatment

of provisions.
35.
The support provided by monetary policy was effective in limiting the impact of
weaker external conditions. The tightening during 2008, declining food inflation, and wellanchored inflation expectations created room for letting the exchange rate absorb the brunt of
the external shock, while easing monetary conditions. With expectations still inside the target
range, the monetary stance during 2010 should remain accommodative until there is clear
evidence of a sustained recovery. Close monitoring of forward looking indicators of activity
and inflation will be critical to decide the timing of the change in stance. In particular, the
authorities should prevent anticipated increases in food prices to affect long-term inflation
expectations.
36.
Fiscal policy was also supportive. The deterioration of the fiscal position in 2009,
including through a modest fiscal stimulus, did not jeopardize medium-term sustainability.
The fiscal stance envisaged for 2010 is also appropriate, with an additional deterioration
explained mostly by transitory factors. Going forward, the fiscal deficit is expected to fall

23
below 2 percent of GDP and public debt to resume a downward trend as the output gap is
closed, growth returns to potential, government spending is kept in check, and oil-related
revenues increase.
37.
The response to a possible surge in capital inflows should be comprehensive and
well-coordinated. Staff supports the authorities' strategy of relying on the exchange rate as
the first line of defense if large inflows materialize, but the response may have to involve
other instruments. In particular, fiscal policy may need to be tightened. If the response were
also to include some type of capital controls, these should be price-based and applied to a
wide range of transactions.
38.
The intention to adopt a fiscal rule is welcome. A rule would provide stronger
assurances that the recent increase in public debt is temporary and greater clarity regarding
fiscal policy going forward. In addition, the authorities’ recent efforts to contain health costs,
and their intention to take compensatory measures if fiscal risks materialize, are also
important. Staff underscores the need to develop a strategy to minimize medium-term fiscal
risks, including those resulting from investment tax incentives and special tax regimes, and
pension spending.
39.
There is scope to strengthen further Colombia’s reserve position. Higher oilrelated revenues over the medium term would provide the opportunity to gradually build up
reserves and continue lowering external vulnerabilities. The mechanisms to build those
reserves would have to continue being transparent and consistent with exchange rate
flexibility and monetary policy objectives.
40.
Recent further reforms to develop capital markets and improve financial
regulation are welcome. Improvements in the OTC market infrastructure, new regulations
on collective investment vehicles, and the broader investment strategy options for pension
funds will contribute to financial deepening. At the same time, crisis preparedness will be
enhanced by the new liquidity management system, the broader coverage of deposit
insurance, and the tools to facilitate bank resolution. The recent regulatory changes on banks’
provisions are also an improvement, but the regulation is complex compared to that in other
countries and has limited scope to reduce procyclicality.
41.
There have been no changes in Colombia’s exchange restrictions since the last
Article IV consultation. Staff recommends approval of the retention of the restriction and
multiple currency practice arising from taxing remittances of nonresident profits earned prior
to 2007, given that they are non-discriminatory in application, maintained for balance of
payments reasons, and will have been fully phased out by January 1, 2012. Staff does not
recommend approval of the retention of the restriction derived from the special regime in the
hydrocarbons sector, since there is no timetable for its removal.
42.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultations be held on the 12-month
cycle.

1/ Does not assume any draw ings under the Flexible Credit Line arrangement.
2/ The ratio is calculating by converting local currency GDP using the average exchange rate, rather than converting debt to local currency using the eop exchange rate as in table 1.
3/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, w ith r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms, g= real GDP grow th rate, e =
nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
4/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases w ith an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP
deflator).
5/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP grow th; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator grow th; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflow s in percent of GDP.
8/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP grow th, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator grow th, and non-debt inflow s in percent of GDP) remain at
their levels of the last projection year.

denominated debt; and  = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
4/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
5/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as (1+r).
6/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
7/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
8/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
9/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
10/ 2009 includes one-off payment of fuel subsidies.
11/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Appendix. Background and Summary of Informational Annexes
Discussions
The 2010 Article IV consultation discussions were held in Bogotá during February 2–16,
2010. The mission met with the Minister of Finance and Public Credit; the Board of
Directors of the Banco de la República; senior staff of several government ministries and
agencies; and representatives of the private sector and a major labor union. The staff team
comprised M. Piñón (Head), E. Flores, L. Jaramillo, J. Jauregui (all WHD), E. Baldacci
(FAD), I. Petrova (MCM), and M. Saenz (SPR). Ms. Agudelo (OED) participated in most
meetings.
Fund relations
The last Article IV consultation with Colombia was concluded on January 14, 2009 (IMF
Country Report No. 09/23). Colombia has no outstanding credit from the Fund. An FSAP
update was carried out in September–October 2004 and the FSSA was discussed in
April, 2005 (IMF Country Report No. 05/287). FAD, STA and MCM have provided
technical assistance since 2006.
Exchange arrangements
Colombia has had a flexible exchange rate regime since September 1999, and the
regime is classified as floating. Colombia maintains two exchange measures subject to
Fund approval under Article VIII: (1) a multiple currency practice and an exchange
restriction arising from a tax on outward remittances of nonresident profits earned
before 2007 and that have been retained in the country for less than five years; and
(2) an exchange restriction arising from the special regime for the hydrocarbon sector,
under which branches of foreign corporations are required to either surrender their
export proceeds or agree to a government limitation on their access to the foreign
exchange market. While Colombia is free under the Articles to impose surrender
requirements and to exempt the application of those requirements, conditioning such
exemptions to the acceptance of limitations on the availability of foreign exchange for
the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions is
inconsistent with Article VIII, section 2 (a) of the Fund’s Articles.
Statistical issues
The quality of data in Colombia is generally adequate for surveillance. Colombia observes
the Special Data Dissemination Standards (SDDS) and its metadata are posted on the
Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB). Colombia is availing itself of a flexibility
option on the timeliness of certain production, monetary and external data. A data ROSC was
completed in September 2006 and was subsequently published as IMF Country
Report No. 06/356.

36
Relations with the World Bank Group
As of February 22, 2010, Colombia’s outstanding debt to the IBRD was US$6.6 billion. The
Bank’s portfolio consisted of 17 active projects, with a total undisbursed balance of about
US$1.3 billion. The latest Country Partnership Strategy was approved in April 2008.

ANNEX II. COLOMBIA: WORLD BANK RELATIONS1
The Current Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) was presented to the Board in April
2008 and consists of five pillars: (i) Sustained Equitable Growth; (ii) Poverty Alleviation
and Equality of Opportunity; (iii) Environment and Natural Resource Management;
(iv) Peace; and (v) a State at the Service of its Citizens. The Strategy is aligned with the
priorities of the National Development Plan, and was designed to be flexible and innovative
in responding to Colombia’s financial and development needs. A CPS Progress Report will
be presented to the Board on April 13, 2010.
The Bank’s response to the global financial crisis was rapid and significant. The lending
program proceeded faster than anticipated. Since April 2008, the Bank Board has approved
loans to Colombia in the amount of US$2.57 billion. Approximately 55 percent of the
lending was in the form of development policy loans. Disbursements since the endorsement
of the CPS have been around US$2.1 billion, while the overall exposure to Colombia,
following scheduled amortizations, has risen to approximately US$6.6 billion. The response
by the Bank to the crisis has led to an acceleration of disbursements in the last couple years,
not only because of fast disbursing policy based loans, but also because a few investment
operations had front loaded disbursements profile. As a result, IBRD lending to Colombia
increased from US$940 million in FY 08 to US$1,275 in FY 09.
IBRD is currently Colombia’s largest single creditor. The country’s close engagement
with the Bank has placed Colombia as the 7th largest portfolio in the Bank Group (measured
by level of exposure) and the 3rd largest in the region, behind Mexico and Brazil.
Colombia’s IBRD portfolio consists of 17 operations under implementation with 23 active
grants (US$48 million).
Aside from financial support, the Bank is also providing an array of knowledge services
to Colombia. The Bank’s knowledge work is covering many issues, from labor markets,
education, health policy, social protection, to poverty measurements, public debt and
contingency liability management, and public sector reforms. Much of this work is being
done in response to requests by the Government and also in conjunction with other partners.
One important aspect of this work is its multi-year programmatic approach, where the Bank
is actively engaged in a consistent manner over time, defining its work program in each area
according to the needs of the country.
The IFC also responded to increasing demand and accelerated the level of its activities
in the last two years. IFC's portfolio in Colombia has tripled in the last 4 years, from
US$387 million committed in FY 05 to over US$900 million at the end of 2009. Growth has
incorporated sector diversification from financial markets, increasing both amount and
number of investments in Oil & Gas, General Manufacturing, Infrastructure, Sub-national

Finance, Private Equity and Agribusiness. The Country is the 3rd largest country exposure in
LAC and 7th in the world.
Recent Activities by Sector/Pillar2
The Banks’ work under the Sustained Equitable Growth pillar has focused on
competitiveness, financial sector development, and infrastructure. Several loans were
extended in this area. The most important were DPLs that supported important policy
reforms in the areas of business efficiency and competitiveness, along with the reforms in the
financial sector. These policy based loans also served to cover the fiscal needs during the
crisis and to preserve macroeconomic stability. This was accompanied by project lending in
the area of infrastructure—one of the main impediments to higher economic growth.
Activities under the Poverty Alleviation and Equality of Opportunity also gained added
significance with the onset of the crisis. A loan was extended to provide continuity in the
financing of Familias en Accion, an important conditional cash transfer program that is now
reaching essentially all of the families in the lowest quintile of the income distribution. One
of the most important elements of the program was the continued work to help build an
inclusive and efficient social protection system supported by a Social Sector DPL approved
in February 2010, and by continuous financial and technical support.
The Bank has an important diverse and innovative program in Colombia to support the
country in the area of Environment and Natural Resource Management. The recent
activities range from loans to support policy reforms and implementation, to grants designed
to pilot key protection and adaptation programs. This has been complemented by many
investment projects in areas of flood protection, water treatment, disaster risk management,
and climate change adaptation programs.
The Bank has also been playing an important role in supporting the country’s efforts to
achieve lasting peace and inclusive development. The Bank is actively supporting the joint
efforts by the Government and the International Community with both lending and
coordination services. Recently the Board approved an Additional Financing for the Peace
and Development Project (complemented by parallel co-financing from the European Union
and other partners).
The Bank’s work has expanded considerably its support for efficient and effective
Government. Recent initiatives have ranged from strengthening the public management
information systems, to integrating the tax and customs administration processes,
implementing a system of monitoring and evaluation of government programs, expanding the
assistance to sub-national governments, and assisting with the modernization of the judiciary.

ANNEX III. COLOMBIA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision is adequate for surveillance. Colombia subscribes to the Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS) and metadata are posted on the Fund’s Dissemination
Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB). A data ROSC was published in October 2006.
Real sector
The National Department of Statistics (DANE) is responsible for the compilation of the
national accounts, although the Banco de la República (BdR) compiles the financial
accounts. Estimates of GDP by the production and the expenditure approaches both use 2000
as their base year. GDP compilation conforms to the methodological recommendations of the
System of National Accounts 1993 (1993 SNA). The revision of the national accounts’ base
year (announced in December 2006) resulted in step increases in nominal GDP levels of
about 12 percent with respect to the prior official estimates. Most of the revisions reflected
improvements in source data, although methodological improvements regarding GDP
calculations/estimates also affected nominal GDP levels.
Government finance statistics
The Ministry of Finance and Public Credit (MFPC) is responsible for the compilation of
public revenue, expenditure, and financing data. While significant progress has been made,
there is still a need to improve the timeliness and coverage of fiscal data, develop timely and
reliable data on the finances of local governments, and improve monitoring of floating debts.
Data cover the nonfinancial public sector (NFPS), but coverage of “above-the-line”
operations of units outside the national administration is not exhaustive due to capacity
constraints.
The General Accounting Office (GAO) has developed a single accounting database for the
public sector. The GAO accounting classification is bridged to the GFSM 2001 framework to
compile GFS on accrual and cash bases. The information is sent to the Statistics Department
of the IMF for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFS Yearbook).
Monthly data have been reported for publication in IFS and annual data for subsectors of
general government on accrual and cash bases have been reported for publication in the 2007
GFS Yearbook, with data up to 2006. Data for the consolidated general government have not
been published yet because of shortcomings in the consolidation process.
Financial sector statistics
The BdR is in charge of compiling data on the financial sector, while the Superintendency of
Banks and the Superintendency of Securities compile data in their respective areas. Fund
technical assistance missions have placed special emphasis on issues supportive of data
quality, including interagency cooperation and procedures to ensure data consistency. The

7
introduction of a new call report form in March 2005 significantly improved the quality of
monetary statistics. In mid-2007, the authorities migrated to the new standardized forms for
reporting to STA monetary data for the central bank (form 1SR) and other depository
corporations (form 2SR). They recently finalized the migration to the standardized forms for
other financial corporations (form 4SR).
Balance of payments and external debt
The BdR is in charge of compiling and disseminating balance of payments statistics.
Quarterly data have been produced since 1994, and the BdR adopted the BPM5 standard in
1998. Balance of payment statistics have been extended to cover transactions in the free trade
zones. Improved surveys, particularly in the service sector, have enhanced coverage and
consistency and financial account data are now based on actual disbursement rather than
registers.
The 2005 data ROSC mission recommended that the BdR, in consultation with the DANE,
develop a methodology to include unrecorded trade in the balance of payments on a timely
basis. The BdR should reclassify FDI intercompany debt transactions from “other
investment” to FDI and some FDI equity transactions to portfolio equity, and adjust the
related investment income series accordingly. Also, it should continue efforts to identify
government bonds issued abroad and purchased by residents as well as those purchased by
residents on the secondary market.
The BdR also compiles and disseminates data on International Investment Position statistics,
External Debt statistics, and the Data Template on International Reserves and Foreign
Currency Liquidity.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation with
Colombia
On March 31, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Colombia.1
Background
With strong policy and institutional frameworks, the global crisis did not have too severe effects
on Colombia’s economy. The economy had begun to slow down in early 2008 as policies had
been tightened to address overheating, but the global crisis caused private investment to
collapse in the last quarter of 2008. Domestic demand began recovering in the second half of
2009, led by public investment and consumption. For the year as a whole, real gross domestic
product (GDP) growth was 0.4 percent. With near zero food price inflation and a negative
output gap, end-year inflation fell to 2 percent from 7.7 percent at end-2008. The exchange
rate served as the main shock absorber, and net international reserves (excluding the special
drawing rights (SDR) allocation) remained broadly constant at the end-2008 level of US$24
billion. The financial system did not experience major strains from the global crisis as capital

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

adequacy remained strong and non-performing loans increased only slightly, backed by high
provisions. The corporate sector’s strong balance sheets and the moderate levels of
household debt also helped avoid financial distress.
The authorities were able to adopt countercyclical monetary and fiscal policy measures.
Monetary policy responded swiftly, with a 650 basis point reduction in the policy rate (to
3½ percent). Fiscal policy also contributed to support demand, imparting a fiscal impulse of
about 1 percent of GDP in 2009 as measured by the change in the combined public sector
overall structural balance. With uninterrupted access to capital markets, the government was
able to preemptively increase its foreign borrowing (about 2 percent of GDP). Furthermore,
several measures were taken to strengthen financial sector resilience, including an agreement
between banks and the superintendent to retain a portion of 2008 profits.
The outlook for 2010 is generally positive. Real GDP growth in 2010 is projected at about
2¼ percent, reflecting the upturn in the world economy and the impact of the expansionary
policies of 2009 (though dampened by lower exports to Venezuela). Inflation is likely to remain
within the central bank target range of 2−4 percent, as the effects of El Niño on food inflation
are expected to be short lived and likely to be offset by the output gap and peso appreciation.
The external current account deficit is expected to widen in 2010 to 3.1 percent of GDP on
account of lower exports to Venezuela and a pickup in oil investment-related imports. The bulk
of this deficit would be financed by foreign direct investment, with other private flows also
expected to recover.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Colombian authorities for maintaining strong policy and
institutional frameworks during the global crisis. This, together with an early request for a
flexible credit line from the Fund, contributed to preserving external confidence and limiting the
impact of the crisis. Directors considered that, with improved economic fundamentals and a
healthy banking system, Colombia is well-placed to confront the challenges posed by the still
uncertain global outlook.
Directors considered that monetary and fiscal policies should remain broadly supportive until
there is clear evidence of sustained recovery. Consequently, close monitoring of forward
looking indicators of activity and inflation will be essential to guide the size and timing of the
withdrawal of support. Directors emphasized that the Colombian authorities should prevent
anticipated increases in food prices from affecting long-term inflation expectations.
Directors noted that the deterioration of the fiscal position was mainly driven by weak domestic
demand conditions. In the medium term, as economic activity recovers, oil-related revenues
increase, and government spending is kept in check, the fiscal deficit is expected to fall and

3
public debt to resume a downward trend. Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to
establish a fiscal rule, which would provide stronger assurances that the recent increase in
public debt will be undone. A number of Directors encouraged the authorities to broaden the
coverage of the fiscal rule. Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to contain health
costs, and their intention to take compensatory measures if fiscal risks materialize. They also
encouraged the authorities to further develop a strategy to minimize medium-term fiscal risks,
including those resulting from investment tax incentives and special tax regimes, and pension
spending.
Directors agreed that the flexible exchange rate policy has helped protect the external position
in the face of adverse shocks. Some Directors considered that other temporary instruments
could complement the flexible exchange rate regime and rule-based intervention in the foreign
exchange market as a policy response if the risk of a surge in capital inflows were to
materialize. Some Directors saw merit in further strengthening reserve coverage, while others
stressed that the authorities pay close attention to the costs and externalities of reserve
accumulation. Directors encouraged the authorities to remove the exchange restriction arising
from the special regime for the hydrocarbons sector.
Directors noted the soundness of the financial system, and welcomed improvements in
financial regulation and reforms to develop capital markets. The new liquidity management
system, the broader coverage of deposit insurance, and the enhanced tools to facilitate bank
resolution, further strengthen crisis preparedness. Directors commended the authorities for
improvements in the over-the-counter market infrastructure, new regulations on collective
investment vehicles, and the broader investment strategy options for pension funds, which will
contribute to financial deepening.

Statement by Mr. Vargas
We thank staff for the very interesting and insightful discussions during the recent mission in
Bogotá and for an accurate report. We are also grateful for the research papers written on
issues relevant for the Colombian authorities. We appreciate the focus given to future
challenges for macroeconomic policy under the changing circumstances of our economy. We
are taking serious consideration of their recommendations.
As it was anticipated, the Colombian economy bore well the recent external crisis, which
brought about a drop in terms of trade, a marked decline in the growth rates of our main
markets and a sharp fall in consumer and business confidence. As a result, both domestic and
external demand shrank. Since the second half of 2009, severe restrictions on Colombian
exports to Venezuela added to the negative shocks hitting the economy.
The policy response consisted of a swift reduction of interest rates by the Central Bank (650
bps between December 2008 and November 2009) and a moderately countercyclical fiscal
stance, which allowed for the operation of automatic stabilizers, increased public
consumption growth and an acceleration of investment in infrastructure projects. We also
tapped international markets and multilateral institutions to secure precautionary external
financing for the economy.
This strategy helped sustain aggregate demand and growth. The reversion of the commodity
price surge of 2008 worked in the same direction, producing a rapid fall in inflation and
boosting household income. In consequence, GDP growth was 0.4 percent in 2009. CPI
inflation fell from 7.7 percent in December 2008 to 2 percent in December 2009, falling into
our long-term target (2-4 percent). Despite the fall in exports, the current account deficit
narrowed to 2.2 percent of GDP in 2009, as a result of a larger reduction of imports related to
the retrenchment of aggregate demand.
For 2010 GDP growth is expected to be in the lower part of the range of 2-4 percent, thanks
to improving external conditions and the effects of expansionary macroeconomic policies.
Some indicators are already showing an upturn in private consumption. Nonetheless, we
coincide with staff that the recovery is still fragile and that withdrawal from last year’s
expansionary fiscal and monetary policies must take into account external factors, such as the
uncertain strength of the global recovery and the full effects of the drastic reduction of
exports to Venezuela.
Over the medium term, the main policy issues are progressing in the fiscal consolidation
front, keeping inflation within the long-run target of 2-4 percent and dealing with the
macroeconomic effects of the rapid expansion of the hydrocarbons and mining sectors. The
large investment flows attracted by these sectors and the foreign currency revenues they are
expected to generate pose a challenge to macroeconomic policy.
Fiscal policy
The Combined Public Sector deficit increased from 0.1 percent of GDP in 2008 to 2.7
percent of GDP in 2009, above the initial target set by the Government. This was mainly due
to tax revenues significantly lower than originally planned.

1

The current budget reduces expenditures by 1.1 percent of GDP, as the central government
investment is driven back to normal levels and further expenditure cuts were made in
response to low tax revenues in the beginning of this year. The structural fiscal deficit would
increase slightly in 2010, striking a balance between public debt sustainability and the fiscal
stimulus on aggregate demand.
In the medium term the main challenge is to accommodate increasing health related
expenditures. A Constitutional Court ruling has made full coverage of health services
mandatory. The government has made progress in this front without endangering the fiscal
balances, through efficiency gains. Full coverage of children and young adults has been
already accommodated within the budget and current fiscal targets. In addition, in the
beginning of this year the Government increased taxes to finance part of the bill and is
working on a full assessment of the costs to take more actions on the revenue side. Another
expenditure pressure is coming from the need to take care of the people displaced by the
internal conflict.
While the staff’s medium-term scenario seems reasonable, we would be more cautious with
respect to the expected pick up in GDP growth and oil prices. In our view, the economic
recovery would be more gradual and the current account deficit would narrow more slowly
after 2010. This would be consistent with larger flows of FDI to commodity-producing
sectors and a more paced upturn of export demand. Under these circumstances, the fiscal
deficit adjustment might be more protracted.
Although we acknowledge that targeting lower debt levels could be beneficial, we see little
room to achieve more ambitious primary fiscal balances. Going back to the pre-crisis debt
targets over a relatively short span period, as proposed by staff, would require a large fiscal
adjustment that is not warranted, especially under the current uncertainty on the robustness of
the economic recovery and given possibly larger expenditures in health and displaced people
care.
In our Medium Term Fiscal Framework published in mid 2009, we recognized that the crisis
caused a deviation of public debt from previous targets and that we were expecting it to
continue rising for the next four years. At the same time, it was stated that debt would revert
to lower levels, following expected declines in pension outlays (as a percentage of GDP)
after 2014 and the resumption of higher growth rates. In any case, the government is
committed to save the revenues derived from the realization of upside risks (higher oil prices
or larger economic growth). If this were the case, public debt would converge more rapidly to
lower levels.
Monetary and exchange rate policies
Inflation reached historically low levels in 2009, as the commodity price shock of 2007-2008
was undone, producing a sharp reduction of food and regulated price inflation. The weakness
of the economy also contributed to the decline of inflation. Headline and core measures, as
well as inflation expectations fell to the long-term range target of 2 to 4 percent.
The expansionary monetary policy adopted in 2009 has supported private domestic demand.
The channels of transmission of monetary policy have worked well, as reflected by the drop

2

in lending interest rates, which are now 600 basis points lower than a year ago, following a
reduction of 650 basis points in the policy interest rate since December 2008. There is no
evidence of strong credit supply constraints, as evidenced by the reduction of interest rate
spreads and the persistence of loan growth rates over GDP growth rates. This squares well
with the findings of the Selected Issues paper on financial soundness and credit growth,
since, as noted by staff, the Colombian financial system remains solid, liquid and profitable.
Our challenge for this year is to keep inflation expectations under control, avoiding the
second round effects of the supply shock caused by the El Niño phenomenon. Food prices
will increase through the second and third quarters of the year, but we expect a reversion in
the fourth quarter. On the other hand, the weakness of the economy and the appreciation of
the currency will keep core inflation subdued. Thus, our forecast is that headline inflation
will be within the long-term target range by the end of the year. According to our inflation
targeting framework, we will carefully assess the dynamics of the economy in order to set the
policy stance.
We take note of the staff's views on having a yearly target announced by the Central Bank
and the confusion that it might create with the long-term range target. While we understand
their concerns, any institutional change in that sense will require passing a law through
Congress, which we do not consider a priority under the current circumstances. Besides, the
Central Bank has amply communicated to the public and the markets that the objective of
monetary policy is to keep average inflation within the target range, and not only at year’s
end.
During 2009, the exchange rate floated freely with very limited intervention by the Central
Bank in the foreign exchange market. Exchange rate flexibility remains a key element of
Central Bank policy. At the same time, we concur with the staff’s appraisal regarding the
convenience of increasing the stock of international reserves. For that reason, the daily
purchase of 20 million dollars was reintroduced in March 2010, taking advantage of a
juncture in which there were some signs of overvaluation of the currency1.
The daily purchases of international reserves are scheduled to take place throughout the first
semester of the year, in a transparent way, and without any attempt to defend a particular
level of exchange rate. The resulting monetary expansion will be sterilized to the extent
necessary to keep the short term interest rates close to the policy rate
As noted by staff, if larger capital inflows enter the country in the future, the exchange rate
will continue to be the main shock absorber. Capital controls are always an option in our tool
kit. However, we deem capital controls as temporary measures that are implemented
depending on the nature of capital inflows and in accordance with the overall macroeconomic
situation. We believe that capital controls are ineffective in the long term and, if maintained
for a prolonged period, affect negatively financial markets and stock markets.

In particular, the Colombian peso has strengthened faster than other emerging market currencies in 2010, without
significant differences in the behavior of current or expected local interest rates, sovereign risk premia, terms of trade
or the fiscal stance. In fact, if anything, export demand is expected to grow faster elsewhere, due to the fall of trade
with Venezuela. This contrasts with the real exchange rate assessment of the staff, which estimated a near-equilibrium
level for January 2010. It must be noted, though, that the currency has appreciated around 6 percent in real terms since
then, according to several indicators calculated by the Central Bank.

Financial sector
We share the assessment of staff on financial sector issues. The Colombian financial sector
has sound indicators, is well capitalized and has enough buffers to face extreme events. The
Financial Reform Law approved in July 2009 enhanced the liquidity provision ability of the
Central Bank and permitted an improvement in the match of pension fund portfolios with
their customers' risk and age profiles.
Staff noticed some shortcomings in our countercyclical provisioning system. Specifically,
provisions are tied to individual loans and counter cyclicality depends on triggers on bankspecific indicators. Staff contends that these features dampen the countercyclical effect of
provisions and argues in favor of a rule that would allow provisions to be freely reallocated
across loans.
We agree with these comments, but consider that a change in that direction would involve
serious difficulties regarding taxation issues, since in Colombia general provisions are not
deductible from the income tax. In addition, the system adopted is a clear improvement from
the previous one. First, it is rules-based; second, the triggers take into account the average
deterioration of the loan quality of a bank; and third, even though the system is driven by
individual loan behavior, on average it will capture the general credit trends, ensuring a
countercyclical movement of provisions.
Structural Reforms

To strengthen the institutional policy structure, the government decided to complement
the current Medium Term Fiscal Framework with a fiscal rule that secures public debt
sustainability and allows for a countercyclical response of fiscal policy to changes in
output and oil prices. The design of the rule is still in process. It has only been decided
that it will be applied on the primary balance of the Central Government and that it will
be supported by a law. We are grateful for the advice provided by staff on this subject.
Staff recommends that the rule be applied to a broader structural balance (including
central and regional governments). From a sustainability point of view, we consider that
the inclusion of local governments is unnecessary, since there are already stringent
budget rules and a fiscal responsibility law for the regions. However, we agree with staff
that a broader concept of fiscal balance has the advantage of synchronizing the
countercyclical responses of several levels of government.
An obstacle to move in that direction is the political difficulty to involve the local
governments in a rule supported by a law that must pass through Congress. The existing
regional fiscal framework was put in place by means of legislation hard-fought since the
1990s. Thus, new constraints on local public finances would face strong political
opposition and could jeopardize the adoption of the rule.
Finally, we share staff’s view on the benefits of a tax reform that addresses current
deficiencies of our tax system. This is a matter that would be addressed by the new
government that will take office in August.
