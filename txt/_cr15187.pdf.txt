IMF Executive Board Concludes Article IV Consultation with Germany
On July, 10, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with Germany.
The ongoing upturn is benefiting from the euro depreciation and lower energy prices, and is
underpinned by a healthy fiscal position and sound corporate and household balance sheets.
Employment growth has been robust, supported by strong immigration, and the
unemployment rate hit another post-reunification low at 4.7 percent. The oil price drop
brought inflation temporarily close to zero, which has contributed to lift real wage growth to
a twenty-year high. The current account surplus reached a new high in 2014, as the oil and
gas trade deficit narrowed. Fiscal policy was mildly contractionary in 2014, and it is expected
to turn moderately expansionary in 2015.
While credit conditions remain very favorable, credit growth has been tepid, reflecting low
demand despite a more dynamic housing market. The ECB Comprehensive Assessment
revealed only minor shortcomings in large banks’ loan classification or provisioning. The
persistent low interest rate environment is putting pressure on banks’ profitability and life
insurers’ solvency.
The current moderate growth momentum is expected to continue as robust real wages buoy
private consumption and euro depreciation buttresses exports, opening the way for a recovery
in machinery and equipment investment. All in all, GDP is expected to grow by 1.6 percent
this year and 1.7 percent next year. The output gap should close this year and remain positive
but small in the medium term. Together with a better anchoring of expectations because of
the ECB quantitative easing this should gradually push up core and headline inflation.
Growth in the medium term, however, is expected to remain constrained by the still weak
international environment and fast approaching adverse demographic developments.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every
year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country's
economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for
discussion by the Executive Board.

Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended the German authorities for their prudent economic
management, which helped consolidate sound balance sheets, a healthy fiscal position, and a
historically low unemployment rate. Together with lower energy prices, a weaker currency,
and accommodative financial conditions, these achievements are supporting the ongoing
economic upturn. Directors observed that medium–term growth prospects are subdued in the
context of a still weak international environment and adverse demographic trends, while the
current account surplus reached another historical high.
Directors emphasized that policies should aim at bolstering medium–term growth while
generating much needed positive demand spillovers and reducing external imbalances. In this
regard, Directors welcomed recent initiatives to step up public investment in infrastructure
and supported the creation of new institutions to improve planning and coordination at the
local level and facilitate public–private partnerships. Most Directors, however, saw scope for
even more ambitious action to fully address estimated needs within the available fiscal space
and contribute to global rebalancing, particularly in the euro area. Some other Directors
emphasized the need to preserve fiscal buffers or were concerned about the impact of
administrative capacity constraints on the quality of investment.
Directors encouraged further efforts to reduce barriers to competition in the services sector,
particularly in the area of professional services, which would lead to higher productivity and
lower prices for users. Directors welcomed progress on the ambitious program to phase out
nuclear energy and transition to renewable energy sources, but noted that several challenges
remain in containing costs for users, as well as securing conventional back-up capacity and
grid expansion. Faster progress on addressing these challenges would support domestic
private investment.
Directors observed that, despite record immigration, rapid population aging would have
increasingly adverse effects on labor supply and potential growth after 2020. This calls for
stronger policies to spur female labor force participation, including by stepping up the
provision of high-quality child care services (especially after-school programs) and lowering
high marginal tax rates on secondary earners.
Directors welcomed German banks’ continued strengthening of their capital position
following the Single Supervisory Mechanism’s Comprehensive Assessment last year. This is
particularly important in view of the multiple challenges facing parts of the banking system
such as structurally low profitability, lingering crisis legacies, litigation costs, and the need to
adjust business models to the post-crisis regulatory environment. Close cooperation and
coordination among the supervisory institutions is key in this context.
Directors emphasized the need for continued close monitoring of the housing market and the
life insurance sector, where persistently low interest rates may give rise to financial
vulnerabilities. In this regard, they supported enhancing the macroprudential toolkit through

instruments that curb loan demand and address potential future excesses in the housing
sector. They also highlighted the need to make full use of the new early intervention powers
granted to supervisors by the Life Insurance Reform Act passed last year so as to ensure that
life insurance companies maintain sufficient capital buffers.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
June 22, 2015

KEY ISSUES
Context:


Growth is benefiting from lower energy prices and euro depreciation, and the labor
market is strong.



The external position remains substantially stronger than implied by medium-term
fundamentals as the current account surplus reached another historical high.



The fiscal position is healthy, corporate and household balance sheets are sound.



Low interest rates are compounding chronically weak bank profitability and hurting
life insurers’ solvency.



The population is aging fast despite record immigration, which will increasingly harm
growth prospects after 2020.

Policy priorities: Further progress is urgently needed to raise potential growth while
generating beneficial spillovers to the rest of the euro area and lowering the large current
account surplus:


Step up investment addressing weaknesses in public infrastructure to strengthen
potential output and domestic demand. To facilitate this process, put in place new
institutions that enable better planning and coordination of public investment at the
local level.



Enhance competition to foster a more productive services sector.



Reduce disincentives for women to work full time as a way to mitigate the adverse
effects of an aging population on labor supply.



Expand the macroprudential toolkit to better address potential future excesses in the
housing sector.



Ensure that life insurance companies maintain sufficient capital buffers to withstand a
prolonged period of low interest rates.

An upturn is under way as the economy is enjoying the benefits of the euro
depreciation and lower energy prices. The anticipation of the ECB’s quantitative easing (QE)
significantly lowered interest rates and term spreads, weakened the euro, and, together with the
drop in energy prices, helped overcome the unexpected slowdown of mid-2014 (Figure 1). By the

momentum boosted imports, while the weaker euro during the second half of the year helped
strengthen export performance in spite of a slowdown in emerging markets.
2.
The oil price drop brought inflation temporarily close to zero, contributing to lift real
wage growth to a twenty-year high. Core inflation is low and stable at around 1 percent, while
real compensation per employee increased by 1.7 percent in 2014 (Figure 2). Employment kept
growing strongly—though the trend in total hours worked has been less dynamic—and the
unemployment rate hit another post-reunification low at 4.7 percent, while Germany became the
second largest migration destination in the world after the U.S. last year. Recent collective
agreements and ongoing wage negotiations suggest continued significant real wage growth this
year. The new minimum wage, introduced on January 1, 2015 and implemented over two years, has
had no visible impact on total employment so far.

The current account surplus continued
to grow in 2014, reaching 7.6 percent of GDP.
The narrowing of the oil and gas trade deficit was
the main contributor to the expansion in the
surplus (Figure 3), which was the largest in the
world in USD terms. The surplus vis-à-vis euro
area economies (Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal,
Spain) with high borrowing spreads during the
2010-11 sovereign debt crisis was stable after
declining substantially during the crisis. Regarding

saving-investment balances, non-financial corporations and the general government increased their
surpluses in 2014 relative to 2013. In fact, the surplus of non-financial corporations, at 2.2 percent of
GDP, reached its highest level since reunification. The CPI-based real effective exchange rate was
roughly stable in 2014, but has since depreciated by 6 percent from its 2014 average primarily
because of nominal depreciation vis-à-vis the dollar and the renminbi. The net international
investment position (NIIP) continued to grow in 2014, reflecting stronger direct and portfolio
investment positions. Yet, monetary and financial institutions cut back their net foreign lending
position, continuing a trend observed since 2009.
4.
Fiscal policy was mildly contractionary in 2014, while it is expected to turn mildly
expansionary in 2015. The government presented a balanced federal budget for 2015, one year
ahead of schedule (Figure 4). The general government surplus rose to 0.6 percent of GDP in 2014—a
structural improvement of 0.3 percent relative to 2013—owing to lower-than-expected interest
payments and one-off revenue items. A negative interest rate–growth rate differential pushed the
debt ratio further down, to 74.7 percent of GDP. The structural fiscal position for 2015 is expected to
remain comfortably within the boundaries set by the constitutional debt brake rule at the federal
level and the European Medium-Term Objective (MTO) at the general government level (maximum
structural deficits of 0.35 percent and 0.5 percent of GDP, respectively).
5.
Credit growth remains tepid despite record-low interest rates. The yield on 10-year
bunds, after reaching a trough of 0.1 percent in mid-April, recently rebounded sharply as market
volatility suddenly jumped—possibly reflecting lower market liquidity—but remains very low from a
historical perspective, with negative yields extending up to the 3-year maturity. Already historically
low bank lending rates have fallen further with the anticipation of QE (Figure 5), while stock prices
have accelerated sharply. So far, however, credit growth has remained subdued, especially in the
corporate sector, where companies can finance a large share of their investment needs from
retained earnings and cash reserves, resulting in low credit demand. A more dynamic housing
market (especially in some “hot spots”) over the past few years has been accompanied by tepid
aggregate mortgage lending growth, although there are signs of acceleration in recent months.
6.
The Single Supervisory Mechanism’s (SSM) Comprehensive Assessment revealed only
minor shortcomings in loan classification or provisioning but showed relatively low capital
quality and leverage ratios in the large-bank segment of the banking sector. As expected, the
higher provisioning needs identified by the asset quality review were concentrated in shipping
finance and commercial real estate portfolios. All assessed banks, except a relatively small one,
passed the stress tests. This very positive outcome was partially due to the fact that some types of
capital that are being phased out under the new European regulation were still counted as eligible
for the exercise.1 Furthermore, while banks’ leverage ratio is currently not subject to EU-wide
regulation, SSM disclosures showed that many of the largest German banks had leverage ratios
close to or below 4 percent (Figure 6), a level emerging as the new regulatory minimum in a
growing number of European countries (Netherlands, Switzerland, U.K.).

1

According to stress test results published by the European Banking Authority, a total of five German banks would
have had a capital shortfall in the adverse scenario under a fully loaded (as opposed to phase-in) common equity Tier
1 metric.

B. Outlook and Risks
7.
The more favorable external environment should support the growth momentum. The
robust private consumption dynamics of the past three quarters is projected to persist with the help
of lower energy prices and strong real wage growth. The euro depreciation and lower real interest
rate (as QE pushes up inflation expectations) should buttress exports as well as the long-awaited
recovery in machinery and equipment investment. Although corporate credit demand is expected to
remain muted in a context of cash-rich corporate balance sheets and increasing profit margins for
exporters, QE-induced lower real interest rates should translate into somewhat firmer credit growth.
The fiscal stance should remain slightly expansionary in 2016 (see below). Employment growth
should slow down as the adverse effect of the lower statutory retirement age for some categories of
workers on labor force participation kicks in fully and the already low unemployment rate becomes
harder to reduce further. All in all, GDP is expected to grow by 1.6 percent this year and 1.7 percent
next year. The output gap should close this year and remain positive but small in the medium term.
Together with a better anchoring of expectations because of QE (and despite only limited expected
pass through from the exchange rate depreciation and the introduction of the minimum wage) this
positive output gap should gradually push up core and headline inflation. Although German
inflation is expected to exceed that in the rest of the euro area throughout the forecast horizon, it is
not projected to rise above the ECB price stability objective.
8.
Fiscal balances are set to remain comfortably within the boundaries of the fiscal rules.
For the remainder of the legislature (2015–17) and beyond, budget plans are centered on a zero
balance at the federal level with small surpluses for the general government, backed by buoyant
revenue forecasts. Staff expects larger surpluses than the authorities, mostly on account of lower
projected interest payments (Table 2), enough to bring public debt below 60 percent of GDP
by 2020. Although the structural fiscal balance is expected to decline by 0.6 percent of GDP through
2015–17, debt sustainability analysis shows that the medium-term position is well anchored by the
fiscal rules (see Appendix IV).
9.
The current account surplus is projected to grow further in 2015 and decline only
moderately in the medium term. The oil and gas trade balance is expected to continue to improve
as energy prices remain lower on average than in 2014. In addition, the real exchange rate
depreciation (of 6 percent in effective terms relative to 2014) will also put upward pressure on the
external balance. As a result, the surplus is expected to exceed 8 percent of GDP, a record high, and
decline gradually to 6.7 percent in 2020, as the terms of trade windfall is gradually spent, private
investment recovers modestly, and stronger wage growth relative to euro area trading partners
contributes to realign competitiveness.
10.
Risks to the baseline are more balanced than a year ago, but important sources of
uncertainty remain. There is upside risk to the outlook if the stimulus from monetary policy and oil
prices that is in the pipeline proves more effective than expected. On the downside, a number of
external risks could affect Germany, with possible impact ranging from low to moderate (see
Appendix I):

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GERMANY



A protracted period of slower growth in key advanced and emerging economies or a deeperthan-expected slowdown in China would dampen economic activity in Germany. Unusually for a
large economy, Germany is very open, with an exports-to-GDP ratio over 45 percent, and thus
highly sensitive to external demand fluctuations. While the geographic structure of exports is
well diversified, a simultaneous shock to major emerging economies would have a sizable
impact on Germany (Box 1).



Renewed stress in the euro area, triggered by policy uncertainty, faltering reforms, or political
unrest in some countries might erode confidence and postpone once again the projected
investment recovery. Further monetary stimulus at the euro area level would be forthcoming in
this scenario, but it may need to be reinforced by demand-support measures in Germany.



Uncertainty about the persistence of the oil supply shock and the underlying price decline could
undo part of the recent improvement in consumer and business confidence, both domestically
and in key trading partners. This would be a low-impact shock.



An escalation of trade sanctions with Russia would hurt Germany because of its heavy
dependence (30 percent) on oil and gas imports from that country and might require a reform
of the energy strategy. Other direct trade ties and financial exposures are limited. Germany
could also experience safe haven inflows if tensions rise.

Authorities’ Views
11.
The authorities agreed with staff that the moderate expansion of the German
economy is likely to continue. They expressed confidence in a consumption-led upswing, amid
lower energy prices as well as solid wage growth underpinned by a tight labor market and closed
output gap. While they concurred with staff that inflationary pressures would be muted this year, the
Bundesbank underscored that prices were likely to accelerate owing to pass-through from exchange
rate depreciation as well as the introduction of the minimum wage and recent wage dynamics more
generally, so that inflation would reach close to 2 percent in 2016. The authorities agreed that the
current account surplus would decline only gradually. They also concurred that public debt is wellanchored by EU and national fiscal rules, although they foresaw convergence to the 60 percent
Stability and Growth Pact objective at a slower pace than in staff’s projections.
12.
The authorities saw the risks to the outlook as generally balanced. On the upside, they
noted that private investment could turn out stronger than expected and drive a more forceful
recovery. On the downside, the authorities saw instability in the euro area as a result of renewed
sovereign stress, possibly amplified by relatively low liquidity in some market segments, as the most
relevant risk at the moment, though they noted that the system was now much more resilient than
in the past. They also pointed out that heightened exchange rate volatility was a source of risk, and
was seen as such by many German corporations.

GERMANY

Box 1. Impact on Germany of Slower Growth in Emerging Markets
Growth in emerging markets (EMs) was disappointing in the last two years and there is mounting
evidence that a sizable part of the growth slowdown may have been structural (see World Economic
Outlook, April 2015). Based on simulations using the Fund’s G20-MOD model, this box analyses the
consequences on the German economy of a further slowdown in EMs (Brazil, China, India, Indonesia,
Mexico, Russia, South Africa, and Turkey). In this scenario, the EM deceleration is due to a permanent
decline in the level of total factor productivity (with respect to baseline) that is initially perceived as
cyclical. As a result, EM monetary policy is loosened and currencies depreciate. As successive negative
growth surprises occur, agents gradually become aware that the slowdown is in fact structural and the
monetary loosening is gradually reversed.
Germany is among the most affected economies in the euro area under this scenario. Lower growth in
EMs (GDP is 3 percent lower than in the baseline at the end of the fourth year) spills over to the global
economy, including through a significant negative impact on commodity prices. Among Advanced
Economies (AEs), the negative impact is the largest for Japan and the euro area given their trade
exposures to EMs and their lack of (conventional) monetary policy space, though lower commodity
prices help soften the blow somewhat. The drop in German GDP (-1.5 percent at the trough) is sizable
and reflects Germany’s large exposure to EMs. The current account surplus is almost unaffected
(-0.4 pp of GDP) as domestic demand and imports also drop. Lower exports translate into lower labor
demand, higher unemployment, lower wages, lower inflation, and higher real interest rates (given the
zero lower bound on nominal interest rates), which combined with lower growth prospects, income
and wealth lead to a permanent decline in investment and consumption compared with the baseline.
Moreover, looser monetary policy in EMs initially depreciates their currencies against the euro, which
further impacts Germany’s competitiveness and weighs on exports. As EMs’ central banks gradually
realize that the slowdown is structural, they start normalizing policy thereby progressively correcting
domestic and external imbalances. Germany's real exchange rate converges back to the baseline as
does its current account, but the negative impact on consumption, investment and real GDP of the
slowdown in EMs is much more persistent.

EXTERNAL ASSESSMENT
13.
Germany’s external position is substantially stronger than implied by medium-term
fundamentals and desirable policy settings.


The cyclically adjusted current account balance stood at 8.1 percent of GDP in 2014, while staff
assesses the norm at 3–5 percent of GDP. Hence, the current account is 3–5 percentage points
of GDP stronger than the value implied by fundamentals and desirable policies. While the EBA
model attributes 0.6 percentage points of the current account gap to Germany’s fiscal policy gap
and 0.9 percentage points to the fiscal policy gaps in other countries, 3 percentage points
remain unexplained and may be due to factors not fully captured by the model.



The REER is assessed as undervalued by 5–15 percent in 2014. Applying standard trade
elasticities to the current account gap yields a REER undervaluation of 7–12 percent, while the
EBA REER level model suggests an undervaluation of 16 percent.



Developments as of May 2015, notably the lower energy prices and depreciated REER, point to a
further strengthening of the external position. Preliminary estimations of EBA REER models
based on projections point to a larger undervaluation in 2015 if the current depreciation of the
euro is sustained. While the current account surplus is projected to expand in 2015, the current
account gap may remain stable because the EBA model norm is projected to increase as well,
partly reflecting the evolution of demographic factors.

14.
Germany’s current account surplus has been associated with a weaker domestic
demand than in typical large and sustained current account surplus episodes in advanced
countries. Even though the size and the duration of Germany’s surplus so far are in line with those
of a typical episode, the weakness of domestic demand and, especially, the relatively strong fiscal
position stand out (see Selected Issues). Real exchange rate or terms of trade movements did not
play a major role in Germany’s episode or elsewhere, with the exception of the ULC-based REER
which depreciated in the run-up to and early years of the German episode. Exits from large and
sustained current account surpluses, where they occurred, were typically accompanied by faster GDP
growth—reflecting both higher potential growth and a stronger cyclical position.
Authorities’ Views
15.
The authorities broadly agreed with the external sector assessment. While they
emphasized the difficulty of identifying the ultimate drivers of the CA surplus, they praised the
refinements and expansions of the EBA methodologies, particularly the more sophisticated
treatment of demographic factors and the improved methods to explain cross-country differences in
REERs. They noted that the methodological improvements reduced the size of the unexplained
regression residual for Germany and gave a more reasonable model estimate of the equilibrium
REER. They broadly agreed with the ESR assessment, though the Bundesbank saw the REER
undervaluation at the lower bound of the staff’s range (around 5 percent for 2014).

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
With the economy in a favorable cyclical position underpinned by robust balance sheets
and partly buoyed by short-term factors, progress is urgently needed on policies to
strengthen growth in the medium and long term, while also generating much needed
positive outward spillovers and reducing the large current account surplus.

The working–age population is set to decline soon, which will put downward pressure
on potential growth. For now, stronger immigration and a modest upward trend in labor market
participation by female and older workers have compensated for the adverse effects of aging on the
labor force (Box 2). However, this will become increasingly challenging as aging will accelerate. Also,
currently high immigration flows may not be sustainable, and further increases in labor force
participation by older workers may be difficult to achieve in the future, as suggested, for instance, by
the government’s decision to lower the statutory

In light of the continued weakness in global demand, stronger domestic demand in
Germany, where balance sheets are healthy, would have important positive spillovers. Global
demand remains weak as reflected by inflation below central banks’ targets across advanced
countries and especially in the euro area, where the need to repair balance sheets in the private and
public sector continues to weigh on the recovery in vulnerable countries.3 There is a concern that

Box 2. Potential Output in Germany
Re-estimating the trajectory of potential output in EU countries is particularly relevant at the current
juncture, in light of the introduction of the ESA 2010 national accounts methodology as well as the
need to reliably identify the permanent damage to potential output inflicted by the crisis (World
Economic Outlook, Spring 2015). Staff, therefore, re-estimated potential output for three large euro
area countries (France, Germany, Spain) using the new multivariate filter (MVF) developed by Blagrave
et al. (2015). 1/2/ The MVF improves upon commonly used univariate filters (e.g., the HP filter) inter alia
by modeling relationships between GDP, potential GDP, unemployment and inflation. Judgment based
on information outside of the model can be incorporated to improve the plausibility of results.
In Germany, in contrast with other advanced countries, the scars left by the global financial crisis on
potential GDP growth appear limited. The MVF suggests that potential GDP growth in 2011-14 was at
the same level as in 2005-07. Furthermore, a decomposition of potential GDP growth shows that the
same is true for total factor productivity (TFP) growth. However, the contribution of capital has been
small since 2009, reflecting a downward level shift in investment during 2009-10. This has been
compensated by a larger contribution of labor, reflecting several cross-currents: high immigration has
momentarily put a brake on the previously negative contribution of working age population; in parallel,
continuous increases in the labor force participation rate have more than offset the decline in average
hours worked per employed; finally, the employment rate has kept increasing following the Hartz
reforms (see Box 3).

Under current policies, German potential GDP growth should remain stable around 1.3 percent over
the next few years but start a secular decline at the end of the projection horizon. Given the lack of
major ongoing structural reforms, stable R&D investment rates, and no acceleration in international
TFP spillovers, TFP growth is expected to remain steady, while a modest investment recovery will
gradually push up the contribution of capital. This will offset a smaller labor contribution driven by a
deceleration of the labor force participation rate and of the employment rate. However, looking
th
beyond 2020, the 13 demographic projections recently released by the Federal Statistical Office
suggest that the decline in the working-age population will resume as immigration flows normalize
and larger cohorts reach the age of 75, resulting in lower potential growth.

ever-looser monetary policy might be insufficient to bring about a lasting recovery, or that low
interest rates for long might lead to financial instability.4 A host of policies are needed to address
these problems, but stronger demand in Germany, where public and private balance sheets are
sound, would be helpful. Stronger demand would also speed up adjustment in the current account
surplus, reducing external imbalances.
18.
Policies should therefore focus on fostering potential growth while generating
positive demand spillovers. Using model simulations, last year’s staff report argued that increased
spending on public investment in needed infrastructure, policies to reduce regulatory uncertainty
regarding the energy transition, and reforms to increasing productivity in the nontradable services
sector would lift potential output and generate meaningful positive outward spillovers to the rest of
the euro area, while reducing the current account surplus. In particular, higher public and private
investment (the latter brought about by energy sector reforms) were found to have especially large
spillover multipliers.5
19.
Policies that directly target higher wages may generate negative outward spillovers if
they result in lower employment and weaker economic activity in Germany. The widening
current account surplus in the mid-2000s coincided with labor market reforms that strengthened
incentives for the unemployed to return to work. The reforms were accompanied by declining real
wages and unit labor costs (Box 3). While real wages and unit labor costs began to rise in 2008 and
the labor share is back to its long-term average, the current account surplus has not declined,
raising the question of whether policies should try to achieve faster wage growth to foster external
rebalancing. Model simulations indicate that policies that directly target wage increases (such as a
social pact or measures to strengthen the negotiating power of workers) would lead to a REER
appreciation and a modest fall in the current account surplus, but would also bring about reductions
in employment and production in Germany as well as negative growth spillovers to the rest of the
euro area (see Selected Issues). By contrast, wage increases resulting from positive demand shocks
would be associated with higher output and employment and a lower current account surplus in
Germany as well as positive growth and economic activity in the rest of the euro area.
Authorities’ Views
20.
The authorities agree that population aging is a primary concern and would be
comfortable with a lower current account surplus, but emphasized that the current account
balance is not a specific policy goal. They shared concerns about declining long-term growth
rates and lackluster private investment in spite of low interest rates, and were thus open to policies
that might improve the corporate sector’s willingness to invest in Germany and, through that
avenue, reduce the current account surplus. However, they rejected any notion of fiscal stimulus
citing the closed output gap and limited outward spillovers. They also emphasized that in a

Box 3. The Hartz Labor Market Reforms 10 Years on
As other European countries, beginning in the mid-1970s Germany experienced an upward trend in the
unemployment rate as increases in recessions were only partially reversed in expansions. In 2003-05,
with unemployment at new highs, Germany embarked on a sweeping set of reforms (the Hartz reforms).
The reforms eased regulation on temporary work agencies, relaxed firing restrictions, restructured the
federal unemployment agency, significantly reduced benefits for long-term unemployed (which were
high in international comparison), and tightened job search and acceptance obligations for benefit
recipients. Following the reforms, the unemployment rate declined steadily and is now at its lowest level
since reunification. Were the Hartz reforms a key factor in reducing structural unemployment or did
other factors play a role?
Existing studies have argued that the reforms helped reduce unemployment and increased the efficiency
of job search but lowered average wages and increased wage inequality. An alternative view is that the
favorable labor market developments in Germany mainly reflected wage moderation induced by the
competition from Eastern Europe. To shed further light on these questions, staff research (Niklas
Engbom, Enrica Detragiache, Faezeh Raei, “The German Labor Market Reforms and Post-Unemployment
Earnings,” IMF Working Paper, forthcoming) using data from a detailed administrative dataset compares
the pre- and post-reform labor market experience of two groups of workers: those in stable employment
and those re-entering from unemployment from short-term unemployment (displaced workers). The
chart below plots the median earnings of the two groups (normalized so that the two series have the
same average during the pre-reform years), and shows that after the reforms the earnings of displaced
workers fell markedly while those of other workers remained flat. This suggests that displaced workers
were more willing to accept lower paying jobs to exit from unemployment after the reforms. The same
result is confirmed when tested in a rigorous regression framework, in which observable and
unobservable worker characteristics and macroeconomic factors are controlled for. These findings
suggest that the reforms succeeded in strengthening incentives to return to work, thereby
contributing to the sharp reduction in unemployment observed in Germany since 2005. As they
achieved this goal, however, they imposed a higher burden on workers experiencing unemployment
in terms of reduced post-unemployment earnings.

Overall, they were comfortable with current nominal and real wage growth, which they saw as
reflecting the tightening labor market and bringing about the needed realignment of
competitiveness within the euro area at an appropriate pace.

B. Public Investment
21.
The government stepped up initiatives to boost public investment, although there is
scope for more ambitious action. Last year, the Fund called for a 2 percent increase in investment
in infrastructure over four years to address needs identified by expert studies. The federal
government recently announced plans to raise public investment. These include 0.1 percent of GDP
allocated to a new infrastructure fund for financially weaker municipalities in 2015 (plus a new
allocation of about ½ this year’s size for 2017) as well as new spending mostly in public
transportation, the digital infrastructure, and energy efficiency improvements totaling 0.4 percent of
GDP over 2016–18. All in all, the 2015 German Stability Program foresees the general government
public capital spending to increase on average by 4.6 percent per year during 2015–19, against an
average growth rate of 1.7 percent in 2011–14, and going from 2.2 percent of GDP in 2014 to
2.3 percent of GDP in 2019. A further boost to public investment is expected to come from financial
relief granted to municipalities, although this effect cannot be quantified yet. Additional increments
in infrastructure spending outside the general government (for instance, by public enterprises or
private-public partnerships) may also be forthcoming. Overall, however, the new plans appear to be
well short of last year’s Fund advice. Delivering on the reminder of the proposed increase would be
desirable. If fully financed through the budget, and implemented during the current legislature, such
a program would utilize most of the fiscal space available under the MTO, bringing the general
government structural balance down to -0.3 percent of GDP by 2017 (Figure 4). The medium-term
fiscal position, however, would remain well anchored. The additional investment expenditure would
also complement ongoing centralized investment initiatives at the European level, such as the
European Fund for Strategic Investment (Juncker Plan).
22.
To facilitate ratcheting up public investment, new initiatives to improve the planning
process at the local level and facilitate public private partnerships (PPPs) would be useful. A
third of public investment is executed at the municipal level. Stretched public finances in some
regions have constrained investment budgets in the past and will likely continue to do so in the
medium term, as regions need to reach zero structural balance by 2020. In addition, at the federal
and general government level mounting aging costs and a normalization of real interest rates are
likely to make meeting the fiscal rules in the future more challenging than at present, possibly
putting renewed pressure on public investment budgets. Hence, alternative financing mechanisms
such as PPPs may be useful to boost public investment now and help ensure adequate investment
levels in the future. However, as local authorities may have limited expertise to contract with the
private sector, and the planning process for infrastructure is seen as fragmented and less efficient
than at the federal level, the creation of a coordinating agency could be particularly beneficial (see
Selected Issues). Such an agency would advise on contract design, help improve information
transparency, and inform the public debate on project selection by highlighting fiscal risks and
cross-project externalities. In addition, sector-specific infrastructure companies, as proposed by the
20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GERMANY

Expert Commission on “Increasing Investment in Germany,” would be helpful as long as the
associated fiscal risks are appropriately managed, either by a transfer of project risks to the private
sector or by including the companies in the general government perimeter.
Authorities’ Views
23.
The authorities noted that public investment had been stepped up substantially by the
government and underlined the need to maintain buffers under the fiscal rule. The Ministry of
Finance viewed the new initiatives of the current government as a substantial investment expansion
package, and did not see merit in further increases also in light of other priorities, such as income
tax relief after years of “bracket creep.” It also stressed the need to maintain some margins under
the fiscal rules in case of adverse budgetary surprises and the benefit of having a budgetary anchor,
such as a balanced federal budget, which can be easily explained to the public. The Ministry agreed
that a coordinating agency could help mobilize investment at the local level, but pointed out that
creating such an agency would take time (hence the importance of support from federal transfers in
the short run), and it may prove challenging given the German federal framework.

incumbent operator and thus promote greater competition in all business segments.
25.
On the energy front, progress is being made to tackle the challenges from the
ambitious program of transition to renewable sources and nuclear phase-out, but several
issues remain. The Renewable Energy Act was amended last year to help contain costs for retail
electricity users, while the EC decided to allow the continuation of subsidies for large companies
competing internationally at least until 2020. However, this controversial subsidy, which is paid for
by higher electricity charges on other users, remains uncertain in the long run; also, key decisions
are still pending on how to secure conventional back-up capacity as renewable capacity is
expanded. A still unresolved issue is how grid expansion can be expedited amid strong opposition
by affected parties in some regions. These challenges should be addressed rapidly to ensure that
electricity costs, already among the highest in Europe, do not continue to climb, and to remove
important elements of uncertainty in private sector investment decisions.
Authorities’ Views
26.
The authorities were confident that the energy transition would be successfully
managed and acknowledged that progress in the area of professional services was slow. On
the energy agenda, they noted that, after many years of rapid growth, in 2015 the electricity price
surcharge related to renewable sources had not increased—though this reflected in part statistical
factors. They indicated that plans to auction off renewable subsidies would introduce more
competition and help curb costs. In the services sector, they indicated that work to identify growthenhancing product market competition policy measures was ongoing. More specifically, on
regulated professions they agreed that there was scope for re-assessing the relevance of parts of
the regulation, but noted that political support for these reforms was generally weak and that they
required a case-by-case review to ensure that quality standards in the provision of services would
not be compromised.

D. Countering Adverse Demographics: Female Labor Force Participation

Staff estimates that if the difference in
average hours worked by men and
women were fully closed, potential output would increase by as much as 7.5 percent. The federal
government has recognized this as a priority and increased investment in the expansion of child
care facilities by 0.1 percent of GDP in total over the last three years. However, faster progress in this
area, for instance by making a comparable investment in the expansion of after school programs, is
essential to broaden opportunities for women in the labor market. This would also help reduce
poverty among single mothers. In addition, reforms to the tax-benefit system aimed at encouraging
full-time work would also be beneficial. These could include lowering the tax wedge for secondary
earners by moving closer to a system of individual taxation, reducing differences in the healthinsurance premiums for working and non-working spouses, and targeting cash support for nonworking parents to poorer households. Addressing both types of constraint simultaneously should
allow for a more effective response of female labor supply.
Authorities’ Views
28.
The authorities stressed progress under way on female labor force participation. They
pointed out that female labor force participation in Germany is one of the highest among advanced
economies, while the prevalence of part-time work partly reflects social preferences. Although they
agreed that fiscal disincentives for secondary earners were high—in particular free health care
coverage of spouses not working or working in a mini-job—they noted that the absence of
widespread provision of high quality child care and afterschool programs was likely to be a more
important constraint to full-time employment. In that context, they highlighted progress made in
these areas over recent years, notably increased child care supply.

30.
The moderate upward trend in housing prices continues and the appropriate response
at this stage is close monitoring and readying the macroprudential toolkit. After years of
stagnation, nominal housing prices at the aggregate level have grown at an annual pace of
3–4 percent for the past five years—only marginally faster than the growth in disposable income. In
spite of falling lending rates, mortgage loan growth remains modest and lending standards appear
stable. Thus, there are no signs of overheating yet. Nonetheless, developments in the most dynamic
segments, such as apartments in large cities, deserve particular supervisory attention, and efforts to
step up data collection on mortgage loan terms and conditions need to continue, including because
of a significant share of high reported loan-to-value ratios (LTVs) in those segments in a recent
Bundesbank survey. Last December, the Financial Stability Committee (FSC) announced that it was
examining an expansion of the German macroprudential toolkit, as recommended by the FSB and
the Fund last year. Introducing instruments constraining mortgage loan eligibility, such as loan-tovalue and debt-service-to-income limits, would be very helpful, not only because they might be
needed in the future, but also because of the signaling value of this policy decision. A carefully
designed communication strategy would help make the most of this signaling value.

also bring its capital ratios closer to its European peers. Most other large domestically owned banks,
which cannot rely on markets to raise fresh equity because of their corporate structure, are expected
to keep building capital buffers through profit retention and/or continued refocusing on their
German core business. A strong capital position is especially important in light of banks’ low
profitability. Depending on the bank, the latter reflects a combination of remaining crisis legacy

banks), the need to adjust business models to the post-crisis regulatory environment (in all large
banks), as well as low interest margins (in the banking sector as a whole). The reform of the
Landesbanken, which are particularly exposed to some of these challenges, is still under way,
although deleveraging is slowing as non-core legacy portfolios have already shrunk significantly and
selective new business is being underwritten.
32.
Close monitoring of the effects of the low interest rate environment on the banking
sector is appropriate. Net interest margins remain under pressure and well below those of
European peers, and banks are reluctant to charge fees to retail customers. A recent Bundesbank
study suggests that banks are increasing term transformation, exposing them to more interest rate
risk. To better assess this risk, German supervisors have recently asked banks that are not directly
supervised by the ECB to run bottom-up stress tests over five-year horizons under various yield
curve assumptions. Further consolidation to cut costs, especially among the large number of small
retail-focused institutions, would seem a natural response to the current environment but appears
to keep proceeding only slowly.
33.
The German banking sector is adjusting to the new European supervisory and
regulatory landscape. ECB staff now coordinates with German supervisory bodies within the
framework of the SSM. Work is ongoing within the SSM to improve the consistency of supervisory
practices across countries and develop a common supervisory culture. Supervisory priorities this
year include a review of business models, governance, and capital adequacy. Initiatives are ongoing
to harmonize options and national discretions set out in the European capital regulation and

directive, while a process to implement a resource-intensive review of banks’ internal models is
being set-up. The Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) has been transposed and its bailin regulation is in force since January 2015, one year ahead of the EU schedule. The harmonization
of the Deposit Guarantee Schemes through the 2014 European Directive is forcing the cooperative
banks and savings banks (together with the Landesbanken) to reform their respective joint
protection schemes, so that they can be included in deposit guarantee schemes and recognized as
statutory schemes. The forthcoming FSAP will be an opportunity to take stock of these
transformations.
34.
Although a breach of regulatory requirements is not immediately in sight, life insurers
still face solvency challenges over the medium term that need to be addressed by ensuring
that adequate capital buffers are maintained. The German life insurance sector is particularly
vulnerable to a prolonged low interest rate environment as investment income may not be sufficient
to meet returns guaranteed to policyholders over the medium-to-long term.8 This challenge will
only be made more salient by the soon-to-begin transition to the Solvency II regulatory framework.9
The Life Insurance Reform Act passed in July last year included a reduced obligation to share
unrealized gains with policyholders upon expiry of their contract, strict restrictions on dividend
payments, and a reduction of the minimum guaranteed rate on new contracts. The Act is expected
to have significantly positive effects on the sector’s solvency, according to Bundesbank simulations.
10
However, the fall in yields since the reform was calibrated has made the underlying problem on
the stock of existing contracts more challenging. Insurers have reacted mostly by reinvesting into
longer duration, higher yielding assets, but this may not be enough and further protection of capital
buffers is needed. Thus, vulnerable insurers should manage their profit participation with
policyholders very prudently, and the new early intervention powers granted to supervisors by the
reform last year should be used to ensure that this is the case. As standard guaranteed rates
products still represent about 80 percent of the flow of new contracts, the industry as a whole would
also benefit from the greater promotion of new products, such as unit-linked products, which
embed much less interest rate risk.
Authorities’ Views

For more details, see “The German Life Insurance Sector: Confronting the Challenges of Low Interest Rates,” Chapter
VII, Selected Issues, 2014 Article IV Consultation. The pension funds sector is facing a similar problem, but is much
smaller in size. At end 2013, total assets were EUR 923 bn in the life insurance sector versus EUR 167 bn in the
pension funds sector.

The current framework (Solvency I) is mainly based on historic cost accounting and is not risk-based. As a result, the
immediate potential solvency impact of low interest rates under Solvency I is limited. The implementation of
Solvency II from January 1, 2016 (with a phase-in period of 16 years) will see a gradual move to a market value and a
risk-based solvency requirement that will explicitly calculate the interest rate risk capital surcharge and discount
insurance liabilities using risk-free rates as a basis. As a result, any problem in meeting own funds requirements
owing to low interest rates will come to light sooner.

The Bundesbank study published last November concluded that in a severe stress scenario the market share of
impaired insurers in 2023 would drop from 43 percent to 17 percent as a result of the reform, and that the balance
sheet shortfall would be EUR 1.8 bn. No capital shortfall estimate was provided. The Bundesbank is planning to
update these simulations in the near term.

The authorities agreed that risks associated with the low interest rate environment in
Germany and other advanced economies should be closely monitored. They explained that
households displayed strong liquidity preference and risk aversion, which was visible from the
growing share of highly liquid deposits in their portfolios since 2008; by contrast, non-bank financial
intermediaries showed a certain appetite for yield. They anticipated that the FSC would soon follow
up on its announcement made last December that it was reviewing the appropriateness of the
current macroprudential toolkit, in particular its ability to fully address possible financial stability
concerns in the housing market. They also explained that the FSC strategy document published last
year addressed a number of the 2014 FSB Peer Review recommendations, and that work on
improving mortgage market databases was ongoing at the Bundesbank. Regarding the domestic life
insurance sector, while acknowledging the extent of the challenge for the industry, Bafin
emphasized that Germany had been proactive in its policy response over the past few years and
recalled the introduction of the so-called interest rate reserve as early as 2011.
36.
The authorities emphasized the progress in building stronger capital buffers over the
past several years and cautioned about too much harmonization of the capital framework
within the SSM. While recognizing that large German banks still had room to catch-up with their
European peers in terms of leverage ratio, they emphasized the continued capital building dynamics.
They expressed their appreciation for the general goal of harmonizing regulatory policy within the
SSM, but noted that the underlying reasons for national options and discretions needed to be
examined, as in some cases they might be justified. They also reiterated their position that it would
be reasonable to abolish zero risk-weighting and apply a large exposures regime to sovereign
bonds, as evidenced by the current experience with the resolution of state-owned Heta (Austria). In
the area of bank recovery and resolution, they expected the European Banking Authority to publish
technical standards on the minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL) later
this year, and explained that a draft German law currently under discussion would make senior
unsecured (tradable) securities subordinated to the bank's other senior unsecured (non-tradable)
liabilities in insolvency so as to provide greater legal certainty.

STAFF APPRAISAL
37.
The upturn is expected to continue in 2015, with growth lifted by the double stimulus
of low energy prices and QE. Private consumption should be the largest contributor to growth,
underpinned by a strong increase in real disposable income. Inflation should remain subdued in the
medium term, consistent with an output gap close to zero. A further decline in the historically low
unemployment rate and sound wage growth point to a tightening of the labor market. Growth
could be higher than forecast if the transmission of lower energy prices and QE proves more
powerful than expected. Notable downside risks include weaker-than-expected growth in trading
partners, or renewed stress in the euro area triggered by policy uncertainty or faltering reforms in
some countries.
38.
Lower interest rates and the strong labor market will continue to support the fiscal
position. For the remainder of this legislature, budget plans are anchored on a zero balance at the
federal level with small surpluses for the general government, on the back of buoyant revenues.
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

27

GERMANY

Staff expects larger fiscal surpluses than the authorities, mostly on account of lower projected
interest payments, which would bring public debt below 60 percent of GDP by 2020. The structural
fiscal balance should decline through 2015–17, while remaining comfortably above the MediumTerm Objective of the Stability and Growth Pact.
39.
The external position remains substantially stronger than implied by medium-term
fundamentals and desirable policy settings. The fall in energy prices and the exchange rate
depreciation will boost the already large current account surplus. We project the surplus to exceed
8 percent of GDP this year and decline slowly in the medium term, as the energy price windfall is
gradually spent and macroeconomic rebalancing in Germany and within the euro area strengthens.
Recent solid wage and unit labor cost increases (against the background of rising employment) are
welcome in this regard, as they facilitate this process. Nevertheless, the persistently large current
account surplus is a source of concern in the current context of weak demand across advanced
countries in spite of ultra-expansionary monetary policies. It may also reflect reluctance by the
corporate sector to invest more in Germany, which hurts future growth prospects.
40.
Commitments to boost public investment should be more ambitious. During the last
consultation, the Fund recommended a public investment increase of some 2 percent of GDP over
four years to address needs identified by expert studies. Such a program would stimulate private
investment by removing infrastructure bottlenecks, thereby strengthening future growth potential. It
would also support domestic demand in the short-to-medium run, help reduce the current account
surplus, and generate positive spillovers to the rest of the euro area. While recently announced plans
to expand public investment target important priorities, they do not fully address existing needs and
a stronger effort would be warranted. This expenditure could be accommodated under the existing
fiscal rules. In addition to infrastructure, the Energy Transition remains a source of regulatory
uncertainty and high electricity costs for parts of the corporate sector, which should continue to be
addressed so as to improve the investment climate.
41.
Infrastructure investment can benefit from initiatives to improve planning processes
and take advantage of private sector expertise. For instance, sector-specific infrastructure
companies, as proposed by the Expert Commission on “Increasing Investment in Germany,” would
be helpful, as long as the associated fiscal risks are appropriately managed, either by a transfer of
project risks to the private sector or by including the company in the general government perimeter.
To boost investment at the municipal level, staff supports the use of alternative financing/execution
mechanisms, such as public-private partnerships. However, as local authorities may have limited
expertise to contract with the private sector, and the planning process for infrastructure is seen as
fragmented and less efficient than at the federal level, the creation of a coordinating agency could
be explored. Such an agency would advise on contract design and inform the public debate on
project selection by centralizing information, enhancing transparency, and highlighting fiscal risks
and cross-project externalities.
42.
With the prospect of a declining working–age population putting downward pressure
on future growth, reducing existing disincentives for women to work full time is necessary.
Although female labor force participation is relatively high, about half of working women work only
part time. While this may reflect individual and social preferences, the tax-benefit system likely
28

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GERMANY

discourages labor supply, given the high overall marginal tax burden faced by secondary earners. In
addition, provision of additional and higher quality child care services and after-school programs
could facilitate the choices of working parents. Faster progress in these areas is essential to broaden
opportunities for women in the labor market. It may also help address bottlenecks in the availability
of qualified labor, which may be holding back private investment. In this regard, reviewing policies
that favor early retirement would also be important.
43.
Fostering a more dynamic services sector through greater competition should be high
on the structural reform agenda. While a strong manufacturing sector has been the backbone of
the German economy, sluggish productivity growth in services may hinder future potential growth
as this sector continues to expand in relative size. Germany’s leadership in this area would also likely
help catalyze reforms in other EU members. In the area of regulated professions, the ongoing
transparency exercise led by the EC is an opportunity to review which parts of the existing
regulations are too restrictive. Pilot proceedings recently initiated by the EC against Germany
regarding price regulation in some professions (architects, engineers, and tax advisors) might lead to
some welcome relaxation. In rail transportation, reinforcing the regulator’s powers to stop
discrimination against the incumbent operator’s competitors should be a key objective of the new
regulation law being prepared.
44.
In the financial sector, the new European bank supervisory and regulatory landscape is
taking shape, while the favorable domestic macroeconomic conditions support structurally
weak bank profitability. Banks are now supervised by the SSM, recovery and resolution planning is
progressing, and safety nets are being strengthened in line with European directives and
regulations. As long-term lending interest rates have fallen further, structurally low profitability is
under greater pressure, and banks will have to address it by reducing costs or stepping up feebased activities. However, the continued good performance of domestic loan portfolios has been
partially offsetting these pressures through lower loan loss provisions.
45.
Steps recently taken by large banks to improve their capital position are welcome. The
SSM’s Comprehensive Assessment last year revealed rather modest additional provisioning needs
for large banks. However, the stress test showed that some capital buffers were thin when capital
adequacy was measured on the basis of the fully implemented new European standards. In addition,
leverage remains high in some banks. Against this background, Germany’s two largest banks’ recent
measures to catch up with their international peers are reassuring. Nevertheless, profitability
challenges remain beyond those related to the low interest environment and, depending on the
bank, reflect various combinations of persistent crisis legacy issues, litigation costs, as well as the
need to adjust the business model to the post-crisis regulatory environment. Close cooperation and
coordination within SSM joint supervisory teams is particularly important in this context.
46.
A moderate upward trend in housing prices continues and the appropriate response at
this stage remains close monitoring and readying the macroprudential toolkit. There are no
signs of overheating at the aggregate level and mortgage loan growth remains modest.
Nonetheless, developments in hot spots bear monitoring, and efforts to step up data collection on
mortgage loan terms and conditions need to continue, including in light of the significant share of
loans with high loan-to-value ratios in segments of the market as revealed in a recent Bundesbank
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

29

GERMANY

survey. Staff continues to recommend that instruments constraining mortgage loan eligibility, such
as loan-to-value and debt-service-to-income limits be introduced in the macroprudential toolkit.
The publication by the Financial Stability Committee of a strategy document is welcome.
47.
Further actions need to be taken to tackle vulnerabilities in the life insurance sector in
spite of the beneficial effects of the reform passed last year. The life insurance sector is
particularly vulnerable to a prolonged low interest rate environment as investment income may not
be sufficient to meet returns guaranteed to policyholders over the medium-to-long term. This
challenge will only be made more salient by the transition to the new Solvency II regulatory
framework set to begin next year. The 2014 life insurance reform, which includes a reduced
obligation to share unrealized gains with policyholders upon lapsing of their contract, is expected to
have significantly positive effects on the sector’s solvency according to Bundesbank simulations.
However, the fall in yields since last summer requires that the industry exert great prudence in the
management of profit participation with policyholders and promote new products that embed much
more limited interest rate guarantees. In parallel, supervisors should make full use of the additional
early intervention powers granted to them by the new law to ensure prudent behavior.

Appendix I. Risk Assessment Matrix
Source of Risks
Risks to the economic outlook
I. Slowdown of external demand, including
because of protracted slower growth in key
advanced and emerging economies or negative
growth surprises in China. With its high degree
of trade openness, Germany is especially
susceptible to fluctuations in global demand.
II. Reassessment of regional sovereign risk.
Financial stress in the euro area could reemerge triggered by policy uncertainty, faltering
reforms, or political unrest.
III. Energy prices volatility. Uncertainty about
the persistence of the oil supply shock and the
underlying drivers of the price decline could
undo part of the recent improvement in
consumer and business confidence.
IV. Geopolitical tensions surrounding Ukraine
(which could lead to disruptions in trade and
financial and energy markets). In particular,
Germany is exposed to an escalation of trade
sanctions with Russia given its heavy
dependence on Russian gas (40 percent of total
consumption).
Risks to the financial sector
Medium-term risks
V. Excessive risk-taking associated with the
low interest rate environment. The recent
strength in pockets of the German housing
market could spread nationwide and real estate
assets could become overvalued. Faced with
falling net interest margin banks may be
tempted to adopt (risky) search-for-yield
strategies.
VI. Life insurance
In a context of persistently low interest rates,
some life insurers may not be able to pay
guaranteed yields to policyholders and may
become distressed. The shortfall would likely
remain a very small share of GDP but may have
a negative reputational impact on the financial
sector as a whole.

since then has exacerbated the underlying problem posed
by interest rate guarantees.

place in the services sector. The EC-led transparency and
mutual evaluation of regulated professions exercise will be
finished in January 2016. No conclusions have been drawn
yet. The government has initiated a review of the
shareholding rules of selected regulated professions.


In 2014 Parliament approved a revision of the Renewable
Energy Sources Act, which aims at containing cost
increases for electricity users and reduce uncertainties. A
Green Paper to elicit views on how to balance renewable
and conventional electrical capacity has been issued as a
first step toward future legislation.

GERMANY

Appendix III. Main Outstanding 2011 FSAP Update
Recommendations
Recommendation
Continue improving stress testing in the
banking and insurance sectors. Rigorously
ensure that any institution that displays
weaknesses on a forward looking basis
strengthens its balance sheet and takes
managerial action.

Institute a harmonized and legally binding
deposit guarantee of €100,000, backed by
adequate prefunding.

Clarify the interaction between the restructuring
fund and the various deposit guarantee and
mutual protection schemes.

Status
In 2014, 24 large banking groups (21 SSM banks and 3
banking groups later deemed as "less significant")
participated in the 2014 Comprehensive
Assessment/EBA EU-wide stress test that covered all
relevant risk factors except conduct risks, while also
reflecting adjustments from an asset quality review.
Moreover, in addition to the macroeconomic top-down
stress test which has been significantly revised (more
elaborated econometric techniques, inclusion of
second-round effects), the Bundesbank recently
initiated a bottom-up exercise that addresses the
profitability of banks in a low-interest rate
environment. This survey covers the banks' projected
income under their target assumptions and different
interest rate scenarios, as well as credit spread and
credit risk stress test components. Regarding the
insurance sector, the Bundesbank applied a top-down
scenario analysis to assess the impact of the 2014
German Life Insurance Reform Act on both the
solvency of life insurance companies and financial
stability. Furthermore, in 2014 the Bundesbank has
developed an inverse stress testing model that
captures an abrupt interest rate rise in combination
with policy holders lapsing their contracts.
Germany is required to transpose the recast Directive
on Deposit Guarantee Schemes (Directive 2014/49/EU,
the "DGS Directive") into national law by 3 July 2015.
The implementing legislation (DGSDUmsetzungsgesetz – DGSD Implementation Act) has
already passed the Bundestag in March 2015. The law
will enter into force on 3 July 2015. The hearing of the
Bundestag's financial committee was held on
20 February 2015 with the Bundesbank in attendance.
The BRRD provides that resolution funds may only be
used if no other private sector measures, including
measures by institutional protection schemes (if
institutional protection arrangements are concerned),
would prevent the failure of the institution. The role of
the German national restructuring fund is redefined by
the SRM amending act
(Abwicklungsmechanismusgesetz). The national fund
will be used regarding firms which are within the scope

Delegated Act of the Commission nor within the scope

There are no SoFFin guarantees outstanding
(31.12.2014). The amount of SoFFin capital measures
was reduced from 17.1 billion euros (31.12.2013) to
16.8 billion euros ( 1.12.201 ). Effective 19 December
201 , the winding up institution FMS
Wertmanagement A R has acquired DEPFA BA
plc,
Dublin – together with its subsidiaries – from Hypo
Real Estate Holding AG. With regard to the winding up
institution Erste Abwicklungsanstalt (EAA), a wind down
of its portfolio is gradually ongoing. On 22.02.2015,
EAA signed a share purchase agreement regarding the
sale of Westdeutsche ImmobilienBank AG, which EAA
took over from the former WestLB in 2012, to Aareal
Group. The final transfer of the shares of Westdeutsche
ImmobilienBank AG to Aareal Group (closing) will take
place as soon as all closing conditions (e.g. regulatory
approvals) have been fulfilled. The sale of
Westdeutsche ImmobilienBank AG will reduce the
loans and securities in EAA's portfolio by approx. 10
billion € (the EAA's assets amounted to 80 billion euros
as at 30.09.2014).
The reform of the Landesbanken is still under way, with
headcount, aggregate balance sheets and RWAs still
adapting to the challenging circumstances. During
2014, legacy issues have been further reduced in some
cases. Overall, for the Landesbanken sector, capital has
improved. Earnings are still at a relatively low level
(with significant differences across the individual
institutions). Business models - which have also
become a focus of attention at the ECB - have to be
reviewed to adapt to the new operating and regulatory
environments. Sustaining restructuring efforts are key
to ensuring the viability of business models. There are
no plans to loosen regional constraints on local banks,
open up public banks to private participation, and
reduce non-commercial influences.

GERMANY

Appendix IV. Public Debt Sustainability Analysis
Public debt declined further in 2014, and is expected to continue to be sustainable, given
high primary surpluses and a favorable interest rate-growth differential projected through
the medium term. The public debt-to-GDP ratio falls steadily under baseline projections,
from 74.7 percent in end 2014 to less than 60 percent in 2020. A negative growth shock
represents the largest risk to the debt outlook. Nevertheless, debt would swiftly return to a
firm downward path after the shock. The realization of contingent liabilities related to
future bank recapitalization needs or worse than expected performance of winding-down
institutions would push debt up by about 3 percent of GDP and gross financing needs
would rise to 12 percent of GDP in the near term. Interest rate or primary balance risks
are important but their impact remains limited.
A. Baseline Scenario
Macroeconomic assumptions. Real GDP growth is expected to inch up to 1.8 percent in 2015-16
(non calendar-adjusted rate), supported by the stimulus provided by QE and lower oil prices. In the
medium run, growth should converge to its potential level, estimated 1.3 percent. Inflation – based
on GDP deflator – is forecasted to temporarily rise to 2 percent in 2015, given a fall in import
deflator reflecting lower oil prices and robust wage growth, and converge to lower levels thereafter.
With QE pushing down sovereign interest rates at all maturities, the baseline scenario entails a
considerably lower average interest rate than one year ago, and dropping from 2.3 in 2014 to about
1½ percent in 2020.
Germany’s high level of government debt calls for using the higher scrutiny framework. Public
gross debt is still 15 percent of GDP above the indicative DSA threshold for high scrutiny of 60
percent. Debt increased significantly over 2009-2010, reaching a peak of 82.5 percent of GDP,
reflecting sizable fiscal stimulus, large financial sector support and euro zone crisis-related lending.
Since the peak, it has declined gradually on the back of fiscal consolidation and a favorable interest
rate-growth differential. Estimated gross financing needs were marginally below 15 percent of GDP
in 2014, but are expected to fall further through the forecast horizon.
Realism of baseline assumptions. The forecasts of macro-fiscal variables affecting debt dynamics
have been on the conservative side. The median forecast error for real GDP growth during
2006−201 is 0.15 percent, suggesting that there is small downward bias in the staff projections, but
the forecast bias is in line with other surveillance countries. Similarly, the median forecast error for
inflation (GDP deflator) is 0.54 percent, suggesting that the staff overestimated inflation in the past
(particularly post-2009). The median forecast bias for the primary balance is relatively large, at 1.16
percent of GDP, among the most conservative for surveillance countries.
Cross-country experience suggests that the projected fiscal adjustment is feasible. The
maximum 3 year adjustment in the cyclically-adjusted primary balance (CAPB) over the projection

GERMANY

period (½ percent of GDP) is not ambitious in cross-country comparison. Germany was able to
deliver larger fiscal consolidations in the past, notably in 2011 and 2012.
B. Shocks and Stress Tests
Germany’s government debt would not surpass 75 percent of GDP under plausible macrofiscal shocks, while gross financing needs would remain below 15 percent of GDP. Under all
considered macro-fiscal stress tests, both the debt-to-GDP ratio and gross financing needs either
continue to fall or swiftly return to a downward path after the shock. Temporary shocks to real GDP
growth, a combined macro-fiscal shock, or a contingent liability shock would nonetheless drive a
temporary increase in debt and/or gross financing needs. Given the historical variability of growth,
debt dynamics in Germany is most sensitive to growth shocks (detailed results below).
List of shocks and stress tests1
 Growth shock. Under this scenario, real output growth rates are lower than in the baseline by
one standard deviation over 2016-17, i.e. 2.9 percentage points. The assumed decline in growth
leads to lower inflation (0.25 percentage points per 1 percentage point decrease in GDP
growth) and the interest rate is assumed to increase 25 basis points for every 1 percent of GDP
worsening of primary balance. Debt (gross financing needs) would peak at 75 (12) percent of
GDP in this case, and converge to 66 (9) percent of GDP by 2020.
 Primary balance shock. This scenario examines the effect of a dual shock of lower revenues and
rise in interest rate, leading to a cumulative 1.6% deterioration in primary balance over 2016-17
(one standard deviation shock to primary balance). The shock would result in a modest
deterioration of debt dynamics.
 Interest rate shock. This scenario assumes an increase of 372 basis points increase in debt
servicing costs throughout the forecast horizon, mimicking the historical maximum interest rate
experienced since 2005. The effect on public debt and gross financing needs would also be
relatively modest.
 Additional stress test: Combined macro-fiscal shock. This test combines shocks to growth, the
interest rate, and the primary balance; while avoiding double-counting the effects of individual
shocks. The impact on debt dynamics is slightly worse than that of a growth shock.
 Additional stress test: Contingent fiscal shock. This scenario assumes a cumulative 3 percent
of GDP (about 90 billion euros) additional support to the financial sector over 2016-2017
comprising of additional re-capitalization needs in the banking system (55 billion euros), a call
on half of capital shield guarantees (25 billion euros), and worse than expected performance of
portfolios of winding-down institutions (10 billion euros). While a highly relevant shock, the
1

Given that virtually all outstanding sovereign debt is denominated in euros, the scenario of a real exchange rate
shock would not have a relevant effect on debt and is therefore not discussed.

46

GERMANY

assumed magnitudes and timing are likely to be on the onerous side. Still, the impact on the
debt ratio is relatively limited, and a convergence to 60 percent is still achieved in 2020. Gross
financing needs would remain comfortably below 15 percent.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Appendix V. External Sector Report Country Page: Germany
Foreign asset
and liability
position and
trajectory

Background. Germany’s positive net international investment position ( IIP) was reduced to close to balance in the
years following reunification. Since the beginning of the millennium, the NIIP recovered and reached 33 percent of GDP
at end-2014. 1/ The pace of NIIP build-up has fallen short of the cumulated current account surpluses but returns
(excluding revaluations) earned on assets have been higher than those paid on liabilities since 2004. The NIIP is expected
to continue to grow as the CA surplus remains sizable in the medium term. German financial corporations have a large
positive net portfolio investment position (38 percent of GDP), while the general government—in part reflecting
Germany’s safe haven status—has a large negative position (40 percent of GDP). During the crisis, the Bundesbank
accumulated large net claims on the Eurosystem (Target2), which stood at 16 percent of GDP at end-2014.
Assessment. Safe haven status and the strength of its current external position limit risks.

Current
account

Background. The current account has averaged 6.2 percent of GDP over the last decade and reached 7.6 percent of
GDP in 2014, a 0.8 pp. increase relative to 2013. Most of the increase is accounted for by an improvement in the gas
and oil balance, with about equal contributions from declines in volumes and prices. This improvement is expected to
strengthen further in 2015, as energy prices should remain lower than in 2014. REER depreciation since mid-2014 is
expected to put further upward pressure on the CA, though it will partly offset the decline in the oil price. On a
geographical basis, the surplus vis-à-vis stressed countries in the euro area remained stable in 2014, after declining
substantially in recent years. The saving-investment balance of the non-financial corporations and the government each
contributed about ½ percent of GDP to the improvement in the current account in 2014 relative to 2013.
Assessment. The cyclically-adjusted current account balance stood at 8.1 percent of GDP in 2014, which is 3-5
percentage points of GDP stronger than the value implied by fundamentals and desirable policies. Staff assesses the
norm at 3-5 percent of GDP. The norm implied by the EBA model is 3.9 percent. 2/
Background. As of May 2015, the CPI based real exchange rate has depreciated in effective terms by about 6 percent
from its 2014 average primarily because of nominal bilateral depreciations vis-à-vis the USD and the RMB. These
exchange rate movements are related to the expected monetary tightening in the U.S. and the implementation of
quantitative easing in the euro area. Despite the recent depreciation trend, various measures of REER were 0-3.5 percent
more appreciated in 2014 than in 2013 on an annual average basis.
Assessment. Staff’s assessment for 2014 is of a REER undervaluation of 5–15 percent. The EBA REER Level model yields
an undervaluation of about 16 percent. The undervaluation implied by the CA regression model using standard trade
elasticities is 7-12 percent. 3/

Capital and
financial
accounts:
flows and
policy
measures

Background. Before the crisis Germany exported capital primarily in the form of bank outflows. During the crisis, capital
flow reversals particularly affected portfolio investment. In 2014, net portfolio and direct investment flows constituted
about ½ and 1/3 of the capital and financial account balance, respectively. The stock of Germany’s net (Target2) claims
on the Eurosystem went down from a peak of €750 billion in August 2012 to €532 billion in April 2015.
Assessment. Lower exposure to the Eurosystem and a resumption of private capital outflows are associated with
reduced euro area financial stress and a partial reversal of euro area financial fragmentation.

FX
intervention
and reserves
level

Background. The euro has the status of global reserve currency.
Assessment. Reserves held by euro area countries are typically low relative to standard metrics. The currency is freely
floating.

Overall Assessment:
Germany’s external position in 2014 was
substantially stronger than implied by
medium-term fundamentals and desirable
policy settings. Subsequent developments as
of May 2015, notably the energy import
price declines and the depreciation of
Germany’s REER, point toward a further
strengthening of the external position.
Recent energy price declines and the
depreciation of the euro, assuming these
trends are not reversed, are expected to
put an upward pressure on the current
account in 2015.
Staff projects some rebalancing in the
medium run due to stronger wage growth
relative to euro area trading partners and
higher domestic demand.
Potential policy responses:
Policies should generate positive demand
spillovers to the rest of the euro area and
focus on boosting growth potential and
reducing the German current account
surplus. Policy priorities include higher
public investment, service sector and
energy policy reform.

Technical
Background
Notes

1/ Germany’s balance of payments statistics, including the
page due to the transition to BPM6.

IIP, are not comparable to those reported in last year’s country

2/ The rapidly-aging population contributes 3.3 percentage points to the estimated EBA CA norm of 3.9 percent of GDP.
Most of the EBA-estimated gap for 2014 reflects the regression’s residual rather than gaps in the policies included in the
EBA model.
3/ The EBA REER Index model has an unusually poor fit for Germany, predicting a depreciating trend that has not occurred.
The result for 2014 is an estimate of overvaluation (of 7.3 percent) that has been discarded from the assessment as
implausible, including in light of the assessment that the CA is too strong.

Exchange Rate Arrangement
Germany’s currency is the euro, which floats freely and independently against other currencies.
Germany is an Article VIII member and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on
payments and transfers for current international transactions. It maintains measures adopted for
security reasons, which have been notified to the Fund for approval in accordance with the
procedures of Decision 144 and does so solely for the preservation of national or international
security.
Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT)
Germany was last assessed against the AML/CFT standard in 2009. While generally comprehensive,
Germany’s AML/CFT framework suffered from some shortcomings inter alia with respect to the
money laundering and terrorist financing offenses, and AML/CFT preventive measures (including the
reporting of suspicious transaction requirements, and customer due diligence, CDD, requirements).
The authorities have taken a number of steps to remedy most of the main technical deficiencies
identified, and in June 2014, the FATF recognized that Germany had made sufficient progress to exit
the regular follow-up process. Notable progress includes the broadening of the scope of the money
laundering offense amending the reporting requirement (e.g., threshold for reporting and
terminology), and strengthening of some CDD requirements (including with respect to the
identification of beneficial owners), as well as of sanctions for noncompliance with AML/CFT
preventive measures. Further guidance for the banking sector on the implementation of AML/CFT
requirements was issued and, in 2012, BaFin ordered sixteen financial institutions to undergo a
special audit focused on the application of AML/CFT measures to their foreign branches and
subsidiaries. The audits revealed occasional problems in the identification of the beneficial owners,
and some difficulties in group-wide sharing of relevant information due to some countries’ strict
data protection rules. Despite the important progress made, some technical deficiencies remain
(e.g., with respect to the criminalization of self-laundering and of terrorist financing, and the tracing
and freezing of terrorist funds). The next assessment of Germany’s AML/CFT framework is tentatively
scheduled to take place in 2020.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is adequate for surveillance.
National Accounts
Germany adopted the European System of Accounts 2010 (ESA2010) in September 2014. The 2005 ROSC
Data Module mission found that the macroeconomic statistics generally follow internationally accepted
standards and guidelines on concepts and definitions, scope, classification and sectorization, and basis
for recording. However, the sources for estimating value added for a few categories of service industries
could be improved. A direct source for quarterly changes in inventories, which is an important indicator
of changes in GDP over the business cycle, is lacking. Extrapolations of changes in inventories are based
on the difference between the monthly production index and turnover index in manufacturing. There is
no systematic, proactive process to monitor the ongoing representativeness of the samples of local
units and products between rebases of the producer price index.
Government Accounts
Comprehensive data reporting systems support the accuracy and reliability of the government finance
statistics. However, these data are based on cash accounting systems, although documentation exists to
explain the differences between the general government data in the ESA2010 classification and the
general cash data on an administrative basis; Germany publishes—through Eurostat—general
government revenue, expenditure, and balances on an accrual basis on a quarterly basis (ESA2010) and
submits annual data for publication in the Government Financial Statistics Yearbook, in GFSM 2001
format. Monthly data are only disseminated on a cash-basis.
Balance of Payments Accounts
The Bundesbank compiles the balance of payments in close cooperation with the Federal Statistical
Office. Balance of payments, International Investment Position statistics, and related cross-border
statistics are compiled according to the sixth edition of the Balance of Payments and International
Investment Position Manual (BPM6), and the legal requirements of the ECB and Eurostat.
Financial Soundness Indicators (FSIs)
The German authorities compiled a comprehensive set of FSI data and metadata. Of the 40 FSIs,
Germany reports all except net foreign exchange exposure to equity (I31) and residential real estate
prices (I37). Even though Germany reports all of the 12 core FSIs, six FSIs are reported on an annual
basis only: (i) NPL Net of Provisions to Capital, (ii) NPL to Total Gross Loans, (iii) Return on Assets, (iv)
Return on Equity, (v) Interest Margin to Gross Income, and (vi) Non-Interest Expense to Gross Income.
Plans are already underway to change the legal basis for the periodicity of deposit taking institutions’
reporting requirements. In addition, the quality of data on bank exposures submitted to the BIS needs
to be improved, including provision of the data on ultimate risk basis for advanced countries.

Statement by the Staff Representative on Germany
Executive Board Meeting
July 10, 2015
This statement provides information that has become available since the issuance of the staff
report. The information does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
Following the expiration of the European program with Greece last week, the risk of renewed
stress in the euro area has increased. So far, the reaction of financial markets has been
relatively muted and contagion has not been significant. The yield on the 10-year Germany
government bond has fallen by 26 basis points since the issuance of the staff report,
reflecting safe haven effects. The DAX stock market index has declined by 6 percent, with
bank stocks especially hard hit. CDS spreads for the largest four banks have increased by
14 basis points on average.
For Germany, the main short-term risk is that turmoil will spread and undermine confidence
in the economic expansion. This would likely weaken private consumption and delay the
projected recovery in private investment. Successful management of this risk will depend on
the timely deployment of the available ECB policy tools. In the medium-term, there is a need
for a concerted effort to accelerate integration within the euro area and strengthen firewalls.
The upcoming euro area Article IV report will elaborate on these policy challenges.
The Financial Stability Committee (FSC) has recommended an expansion of the German
macroprudential toolkit, in line with staff’s advice. Following its June 30, 2015 meeting, the
FSC recommended that the Federal government initiate legislation to give the Federal
Financial Supervision Authority (Bafin) authority to introduce measures constraining
mortgage loan eligibility, such as limits of loan-to-value ratios, debt-to-income ratios, and
debt-service-to-income ratios, as well as minimum amortization requirements. The
Committee underscored that activation of such instruments is not envisaged at the moment.

Statement by Steffen Meyer, Alternate Executive Director for Germany
Executive Board Meeting
July 10, 2015
1.
I would like to convey my authorities’ gratitude for productive and insightful
discussions. My authorities found the assessment candid, comprehensive, and well-balanced.
It is highly appreciated that staff has reached out to a broad range of stakeholders during the
consultations. The authorities’ views have been well-documented in the staff report so that I
can focus on a couple of key issues.
2.
The German economy is in good shape as evidenced by strong labor market and wage
developments, elevated consumer sentiment, healthy public and private balance sheets, and
very favorable financing conditions. The German government plans to prudently build on
these favorable developments of the recent years while ensuring that the progress achieved is
not jeopardized. My authorities share the thrust of the staff appraisal and agree in particular
that the challenge is to further strengthen productivity growth and improve the conditions for
stronger private investment.

Staff’s growth projection of 1.6 percent this year and 1.7 percent next year is in line
with my authorities’ view. This is true for the growth rates as well as for the composition of
growth. However, when discussing current economic developments and the outlook, I would
put more emphasis on favorable domestic conditions, notably the very strong labor market.
As staff rightly notes, there is no doubt that the economy has benefitted from external factors
such as the drop in crude oil prices, the depreciation of the euro, and the recovery in export
markets. At the same time, robust real wage growth and higher employment have bolstered
consumption while investment has picked up in a context of solid capacity utilization and
good business sentiment. As a consequence, growth in 2015 and 2016 is expected to be
mainly driven by private consumption and to substantially outpace potential output growth of
around 1 ¼ percent.
Fiscal Policy
4.
Against the favorable economic background, the German government will continue to
implement its strategy of prudent, medium-term oriented, and growth-friendly fiscal policies.
My authorities see Germany as an important anchor of stability within the euro area and the
EU and for this reason plan to maintain the solid fiscal position keeping EU and national
fiscal rules with a safety margin. This means concretely that the government will increase
public investment while maintaining balanced budgets.
5.
Balanced budgets will help to further reduce the government debt ratio (which is still
substantially above the 60% “Maastricht” ceiling), safeguard the fiscal position against
increasing interest rates (which have already started to rise from historically low levels), and
prepare for upcoming demographic challenges (that will kick in heavily at the end of this

2
decade). Also from a cyclical point of view an additional fiscal stimulus is not advisable, and
not least the IMF, for example in the latest Fiscal Monitor, is advocating a symmetric fiscal
policy over the business cycle and the need to build buffers in good times.
6.
Within the fiscal envelope, the German government has committed to increasing
public expenditures in particular in education, research, and infrastructure. Decisions have
been taken to increase expenditure in these areas by around €44 billion until 2019.
7.
With regard to staff’s recommendation to even further expand public investment, I
would like to highlight the following: While there is a need for public investment, in
particular at the municipal level and in transport infrastructure, the overall public
infrastructure in Germany is still considered to be very good in international comparisons.
The challenge is to maintain infrastructure quality and to expand it where there is a clear
need. To do this and in order to use funds efficiently, a case by case approach for projects is
needed. For one, the administrative capacities for planning and implementing investment
projects are limited. Further to this, high short-term pressure to spend public funds carries the
risk of fund misallocation. In this respect, it is more a question of the need for structural or
institutional approaches to strengthen resources and knowledge transfer for the
implementation of investment projects. Against this background and in line with staff’s
advice, the German government currently assesses proposals to create a service agency for
municipalities to help them with planning, procuring and managing infrastructure projects
and to strengthen investment efficiency.
External Assessment
8.
I welcome the detailed external assessment. The refined external balance analysis
better captures demographic effects which is welcome. It is worth emphasizing, however,
that the model leaves a substantial degree of ambiguity in the case of Germany. The
unexplained residual remains significantly larger than any “policy gaps” (about 3 percentage
points compared to “fiscal policy gaps” of 0.9 percentage points in other countries and 0.6
percentage points in Germany). There are many possible explanations for the large residuals,
such as specific shocks to the savings rate or to world demand for German exports.
Furthermore, despite the general uncertainty around attempts to estimate external positions
implied by medium-term fundamentals or equilibrium REER, the estimated undervaluation
of the REER seems to be too pronounced in my view. In addition, I would like to stress that
the German current account surplus is likely due to a complex set of factors and the result of
market processes and not the result of distortions or targeted policy measures of the German
government.
9.
Simple explanations or recommendations how to reduce the current account surplus
would therefore be misleading. Staff simulations of the spillover effects of directly targeting
higher wages and similar previous studies on the effects of fiscal expansion through lower
taxes or higher consumption spending are helpful in this regard. They confirm that positive
spillovers are very limited or can become even negative if they result in lower employment
and weaker economic activity in Germany. In contrast staff simulations show that policies
fostering potential growth would also generate meaningful positive outward spillovers not

3
least within the EU and the euro area. Against this backdrop, my authorities would like to put
emphasis on market-driven rebalancing.
10.
The recent increase of the current account is driven to a large extent by lower oil
prices. Looking ahead, given the fact that Germany enjoys solid growth and strong nominal
and real wage growth, which is further supported by policies like the introduction of a federal
minimum wage and public investment initiatives, my authorities expect a decrease of the
current account surplus over the medium term and a continuation of the rebalancing process.
Strengthening Potential Output
11.
My authorities agree with the staff assessment that potential output growth in
Germany was more or less unaffected by the global financial crisis. In addition, they broadly
agree with the stylized evolution of potential growth and its sub-components, with a declined
growth contribution of capital compensated by a larger contribution of labor, thanks to a
higher participation rate and strong net migration.
12.
In the medium to long term population aging will weigh on potential output growth in
Germany. This notwithstanding, assuming constant contributions of trend factor productivity
and fixed capital formation probably overstates the slowdown in potential growth. According
to my authorities’ assessment, for instance, trend factor productivity could well be more
dynamic in the medium term than currently observed, as migrants are currently unlikely to
already tap their full potential on the labor market. As tasks can be performed more and more
efficiently over time, language skills improve and mismatch declines, aggregate productivity
is likely to accelerate again in the longer term and should contribute more strongly to
potential growth.
13.
Nonetheless, my authorities strongly agree that policies should be implemented to
strengthen potential growth. Staff’s suggestions on service sector reform, increasing labor
market participation and reducing uncertainty regarding the energy transition point in the
right direction.
14.
The German government agrees that there is some scope for further service sector
deregulation, e.g. in professional services, to increase efficiency, lower entry barriers and
reduce red tape. This can contribute to greater competitiveness and better structural
framework conditions for investment. However, in the German government's opinion, it is
necessary to find the right balance as it should still be possible to retain justified and
appropriate regulations which, for example, guarantee the quality of a service, ensure
adequate consumer protection, or serve a social or health purpose. Currently the government
is examining – inter alia within the context of the Transparency Initiative at EU level –
whether the applicable regulations fulfill these purposes or whether other measures could
achieve this goal in a better or more efficient manner.
15.
With regard to rail transportation the “Act to Strengthen Competition in the Rail
Sector” will further promote competition in the rail markets, provide incentive to boost
efficiency, and help create a single European market. It should be noted that – in spite of a

4
mixed picture depending on the individual transport service segments - the share of
competitors to the incumbent operator in the total turnover of railway undertakings has
increased steadily in recent years.
16.
My authorities fully agree with staff on the importance to successfully manage the
energy transformation. They see that the Renewable Energy Act from 2014 contributes to put
the reforms on sound footing and improves the planning reliability for investors. It also
contributes to dampen the cost increases for final users of electricity. However, my
authorities agree that this is only a first step and further measures have to be taken. Therefore
the government has started to implement further measures such as in the fields of grid
expansion, security of supply, and the future of the electricity market.
17.
Increasing labor market participation is an important objective. Notwithstanding the
fact that female labor participation in Germany is one of the highest among advanced
economies, my authorities agree that the sufficient and high-quality provision of child care
facilities remains a priority. The German government is already providing a total of €5.95
billion in support to the Länder and municipalities for the expansion of child care facilities
for children under three. Starting in 2015, it will provide €845 million annually towards
ongoing operating costs of child day care, as well as an additional €100 million each year for
2017 and 2018. Disincentives of the tax system are certainly an issue, with social security
contributions and free co-insurance of non-working family members often being more
relevant than the treatment of couples in the income tax code.
18.
Overall, the increase of female labor supply will not be sufficient to address the
effects of adverse demographics. Measures to increase the labor force by increasing the
effective retirement age and integrating highly skilled migrants can also help to tackle
possible future labor supply shortages.
Financial Sector
19.
My authorities are very alert to potential risks associated with low interest rates.
Banks not directly supervised by the ECB have been asked to run bottom-up stress tests,
which will enable supervisory analysts to get a comprehensive picture how the earning
situation could evolve in the next five years. The authorities and banks are aware that,
depending on the specific case, low profitability warrants corrective action. Mergers can be
one option to cut costs. Recent evidence points to the fact that the consolidation process
among saving banks and cooperative banks is ongoing. In addition branch networks have
been further reduced. And announcements of two large banks to reduce the size of their
branch networks at a larger scale indicate that this process is still not over yet.
20.
My authorities agree that house price developments should be monitored closely
while signs of overvaluation are limited to big cities so far. They fully concur with staff that
the macro-prudential toolkit available as of today may not be sufficient to address financial
stability risks emanating from the residential mortgage market and should be further
developed. In line with this assessment, last week the German FSC recommended that the
federal government provide for the legal foundations for applying additional macroprudential

5
tools to regulate loans for the construction or purchase of residential real estate. Specifically
and fully in line with international as well as European practices, it recommends to create the
option of activating LTV, DTI, DSTI, and an amortization requirement should such
restrictions be deemed necessary to safeguard financial stability in Germany. Also, my
authorities stepped up efforts to collect data from commercial lenders which will help to
apply and calibrate macro-prudential measures.
21.
My authorities agree with staff that a persistent low-interest environment is a source
of risk for the stability of German life insurers. They also concur that Solvency II will make
this challenge more salient. Regarding measures to increase the resilience of the insurance
sector, my authorities agree that insurers should reinforce their capital buffers, manage the
policy holders’ profit participation share and reduce the dependence on interest rate risk by
means of selling more policies with a flexible guaranteed return or no guaranteed return at
all. Concerning the Life Insurance Reform Act, my authorities agree in general with staff’s
evaluation that this act is an important contribution to improve the resilience of life insurers
and thus the stability of the life insurance sector as a whole.
