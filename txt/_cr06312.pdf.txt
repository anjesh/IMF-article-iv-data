Discussions for the 2006 Article IV consultation and a staff-monitored program (SMP)
for 2006 were held in Bissau during March 16–30, 2006. The staff team comprised Mr. Doré
(Head), Ms. Ocampos, Mr. Saenz, Mr. Veyrune and Ms. Mendez (all AFR). The team liaised
closely with a mission of the World Bank, and the European Union (EU).

•

The mission met with the President of the Republic; the Ministers for Finance, Economy,
Commerce, Public Administration, and Justice; the Acting Governor and the National
Director of the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO); senior government officials;
and representatives of the donor community.

•

After the last Article IV consultation was concluded on November 19, 2004, the Executive
Directors also discussed the ex post assessment of performance under Fund-supported
programs. They noted that the key challenges for the authorities were to restore fiscal
discipline, rebuild public administration, and improve the investment climate. Most
Directors agreed that the next step in the Fund’s engagement could be emergency postconflict assistance as part of a concerted international effort.

•

In their letter of intent (Attachment I), the authorities of Guinea-Bissau request that the staff
monitor their economic program for 2006 as described in the accompanying memorandum
on economic and financial policies. The program aims to stabilize the fiscal situation by
avoiding new domestic arrears for the year as a whole, strengthening institutions, building
technical capacity, and implementing structural reforms to improve the investment climate.

•

Guinea-Bissau is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle and, like other members of the
West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU), has accepted the obligations of
Article VIII, sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement. Guinea-Bissau
maintains an exchange system that is free from multiple currency practices and restrictions
on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions.

•

The quality of data has hampered effective surveillance but efforts are underway in GuineaBissau to rebuild core statistical databases.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
•

Guinea-Bissau has made major strides in overcoming the effects of a long period of
political instability. The period began in 1998 with a civil war and ended in mid-2003 with a
coup. The physical infrastructure was destroyed, the economy stagnated, government
administrative capacity virtually collapsed, social conditions worsened, and poverty
increased.

•

Parliamentary elections were held in March 2004 and presidential elections in
July 2005. Though the process of rebuilding the administration and addressing the country’s
economic problems has clearly begun in earnest, policy implementation must remain strong
and be complemented by considerable donor support if the country is to solve its problems.

•

The main challenges now are to consolidate peace and political stability and to lay the
foundation for sustainable high growth and significant poverty reduction. This will
require Guinea-Bissau to achieve fiscal and debt sustainability and deepen structural reforms.

•

Staff expects a recovery over the medium term, but its strength and timing depend on
how well the authorities can come to grips with the political, fiscal, and structural
problems besetting the economy. Staff estimates that real GDP growth recovered to
3.5 percent in 2005, driven by improved agricultural output. The fiscal balance improved, but
cash flow problems persisted throughout the year. The deficit (including grants) was lower
than budgeted at 12 percent of GDP, compared to 15 percent in 2004, but new domestic
arrears accumulated. The macroeconomic outlook for 2006 is favorable, with real GDP
growth of about 4 percent and CPI inflation of about 2 percent, barring any major supply
shocks.

•

Medium-term policies should focus on strengthening the fiscal position so as to broadly
achieve public debt sustainability taking into account debt relief anticipated at the
HIPC completion point. The fiscal program the government has adopted underscores the
authorities’ resolve to bring public finances under control, but attaining the fiscal objectives
depends critically on progress in keeping current spending in check and intensifying revenue
mobilization. The emphasis on widening the tax base and reducing exemptions is appropriate,
but spending must be effectively monitored from the commitment stage and a monthly cash
flow plan, consistent with spending priorities, must be strictly adhered to.

•

The structural reform process, which has languished over the years, needs new impetus.
An action plan for implementing the long-overdue civil service reform is urgently needed to
produce a durable reduction in the excessive wage bill. The security reform to be launched
with donor support, private sector development initiatives, and measures to rehabilitate roads,
electricity, and water infrastructure should help enhance development prospects.

•

A staff-monitored program for April–December 2006 should enable Guinea-Bissau to
demonstrate its ability to successfully implement an adjustment program and move to
emergency post-conflict assistance as soon as concerted international assistance emerges,
which is likely to be after October 2006.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Despite abundant natural resources and arable land, Guinea-Bissau is ranked
at the lowest end of the UN human development index, mainly because of the civil
war of 1998–99 and the ensuing prolonged political instability and serious
governance deficiencies thereafter.1 These have led to considerable deterioration in the
economy’s infrastructure and the living standards of the population, from which the
country is trying to recover. The small industrial sector was virtually destroyed, leaving an
economy heavily dependent on the cashew sector. After the conflict, real per capita GDP
declined by an annual average of 2 percent until 2005 and the delivery of basic social
services (potable water, hospital supplies, education) deteriorated sharply. The postconflict strategy, which was based on an economic program supported by the Poverty
Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) and interim debt relief from the Initiative for
Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC), began to unravel because the political situation
failed to stabilize. The precarious situation called for deep reforms to reverse the
downward trend, but institutions and technical capacity remained weak. Government
failure to enact sound policies resulted in mounting wage arrears that led to a bloodless
military coup in September 2003.2
2.
Since mid-2004 Guinea-Bissau has made a major effort to address the political
and economic problems of recent years. After parliamentary elections in March 2004
and presidential elections in July 2005, the government began to rebuild the administration
and address the country’s economic problems. The political tensions ignited by President
Veira’s decision in November 2005 to dismiss the majority PAIGC government eased
considerably after the Supreme Court ruled that the nomination of the new government
was constitutional. Parliament’s subsequent approval of the government program and 2006
budget are signs of a broad consensus for political stability and reform. This consensus
emerged with the agreement by all political parties to put the national interest above shortterm political considerations, following international mediation from the regional
institutions (ECOWAS, WAEMU, WADB) in February 2006. The majority PAIGC party
signed on the government’s program because it features most of the reform policies
envisaged by the previous PAIGC government.

1

Per capita GDP is below US$200; two-thirds of the population live below the poverty line; most social
indicators are below the average for sub-Saharan Africa; and the World Bank has classified the country as a
LICUS (low income country under stress).
2

After intensive and broad-based consultation, the military, all but one of the 24 political parties, and
representatives of civil society signed a transitional charter instituting an 18-month transition period with a
caretaker civilian government and a National Transition Council acting as a parliament.

6

3.
During the 2006 Article IV consultation discussions, the mission also reviewed
the country’s performance under the 2005 staff-monitored program (SMP) and
reached understandings on a new SMP for April–December 2006.3 4 The new SMP
aims to stabilize the macroeconomic situation by strengthening the fiscal position and pave
the way for a program that could be supported by emergency post-conflict assistance
(EPCA) as part of a concerted international effort. It should also enable the authorities to
build a track record of policy performance, which is needed for consideration of a new
PRGF-supported program and eventual debt relief.
II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND PERFORMANCE UNDER THE STAFF-MONITORED
PROGRAM FOR APRIL–DECEMBER 2005
4.
Amid signs of a return to political stability, the economic and financial
situation has shown some improvement, although serious difficulties remain.
Economic activity in 2005 was stronger than expected. Real GDP growth is estimated to
have recovered from an average

import prices (oil and rice) in the
first half of the year. Good cereal production later dampened inflationary pressures
somewhat and 12-month inflation declined to 1 percent by December 2005.

3

On June 30, 2005, the Executive Board was informed of an SMP for April–December 2005. The new
government, formed in November 2005, quickly indicated its intention to pursue the broad thrust of the SMP
for 2005 that had been initiated by the previous government and was to form the basis for discussions on an
EPCA.

4

The mission, which was originally planned to take place in late October 2005, was postponed when the newly
elected president dismissed the government. The mission was further delayed because discussions on a new
SMP for 2006 were made contingent on the new government obtaining majority support for its program in
parliament, which occurred in March 2006.

7

5.
Notwithstanding the strong growth in exports, the external current account
worsened in 2005 because of a large increase in imports and a drop in official transfers
and private remittances (Figure 1). Earnings from cashews, the main export crop, were
boosted by a substantial increase in world prices as well as a further expansion in
production (which was modest, however, after the strong increase of previous years).5
Imports grew significantly,

In spite of the strong
appreciation of the euro
against the U.S. dollar over
the last five years, the real

The terms of trade improved sharply (by 9.9 percent) reflecting a 24 percent increase in cashew prices that
more than offset the sharp increase in oil prices.

7.
The fiscal balance improved, but cash flow problems persisted
throughout 2005. The budget deficit (including grants) was lower than programmed at
12 percent of GDP, compared to 15 percent in 2004, owing to stronger-than-projected tax
revenues and lower nonwage expenditures. The domestic primary fiscal balance on a
commitment basis (a program

was delayed as a result of the
political uncertainty following the presidential election; the government therefore
contracted commercial debt amounting to 6.3 percent of GDP, which allowed it to clear
part of the new domestic arrears in 2005.6
8.
Higher imports and strengthened tax and customs administration helped buoy
tax revenue. Custom receipts were boosted by the large increase of imports—which rose
by 43 percent in U.S. dollar terms—and an improvement in customs administration
through the verification of imports shipped by land at the destination instead of the border,
and the required prepayment of export taxes before shipment. Tax administration was also
strengthened through the creation of a Large-Taxpayers Unit with assistance from
AFRITAC, and the simplification of the tax regime.
9.
Budget execution improved. Authorization for expenditure commitments was
centralized at the Ministry of Finance and government bank accounts that were not at the
BCEAO were closed. To maintain better fiscal control, a Treasury Committee was
appointed to reconcile accounts between the Budget Department, the Treasury, and the

In October, the government raised CFAF 6 billion (3.8 percent of GDP) by issuing 180-day treasury bills at
5 percent interest; these bills were placed through the BCEAO, mostly with institutions of the WAEMU area. In
December, when external budget support was further delayed, the authorities obtained additional external
financing from a bank in Senegal of CFAF 4 billion (2.5 percent of GDP) for 12 months. This loan was
collaterized by EU compensation for fishing rights for 2006, but at a substantially higher effective discount rate
of 17 percent.

bill, which exceeded program target by CFAF 1.9 billion.

Total deposits in 2005 amounted to
only 8 percent of GDP. Although the local bank has been increasing its financing of the
cashew harvest, average outstanding claims to the private sector during 2005 did not
exceed 2.2 percent of GDP; average credit to the government amounted to the equivalent
of 1.3 percent of GDP. As elsewhere in the region, the bank is very liquid. The lack of
profitable projects has left it with excess reserves that can be used to manage seasonal
needs of the private sector or the government. The BCEAO has been concerned about the
lack of financial intermediation and is trying to encourage regional banks to operate in
Guinea-Bissau. A regional policy bank focused on microfinance opened a branch in Bissau
in 2005.
11.
Guinea-Bissau’s external debt is clearly unsustainable and can only be
resolved through the HIPC Initiative. After most interim debt relief was suspended,
external debt service obligations, except those to multilateral creditors, fell into arrears.
Total external public debt including arrears amounted to 332 percent of GDP in 2005;
scheduled annual external debt service was about 15.3 percent of GDP (Tables 6–7).
12.
Social indicators for Guinea-Bissau reflect a very low level of human
development (Text Table 1). The data show slow progress and a pressing need for moving
toward the millennium development goals (MDGs). Since 2000, the mortality rate of
children under 5, for instance, was reduced by only 5 percent and the incidence of
tuberculosis increased slightly (Table 8).

7

For most of 2005, only a single bank operated in Guinea-Bissau.

Performance of the SMP in 2005 was uneven. There was progress on fiscal
revenue but slippages on expenditures, particularly wages. Five of seven quantitative
targets and six of ten structural benchmarks were met (MEFP, Tables 2 and 3). The
quantitative targets for revenue, domestic financing, domestic primary budget deficit, and
external public debt were met. However, the ceiling on the wage bill was exceeded, which
contributed to the accumulation of domestic arrears (targeted to be zero under the
program) as arrears in the payments of goods and services were partly used to finance
additional wage expenditures. The mixed performance on structural reforms reflected
serious technical capacity constraints, delays in obtaining technical assistance, and the
change in government.
III. REPORT ON THE ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION DISCUSSIONS AND ON THE
STAFF-MONITORED PROGRAM
14.
In the context of the Article IV consultation discussions, the authorities and
the staff agreed that the key challenges facing Guinea-Bissau are to achieve
sustainable growth, reduce poverty, and make progress towards the MDGs.
Protracted political instability compounded by periodic external shocks over the past
decade undermined macroeconomic stability and weakened institutions. Lack of
investment and inadequate provision of public services led to a deterioration in physical
and human capital and damaged the economy’s prospects for growth. The authorities
agreed that political stability—even if fragile—opens a window of opportunity for them to
implement the necessary policies and obtain much-needed external support to launch the
country on a path of sustained growth and poverty reduction.
15.
To achieve these economic and social objectives, the authorities have
formulated a medium-term strategy directed to achieving fiscal and external debt
sustainability, improving the quality of spending, and mobilizing external financing.
This strategy is reflected in the government program for 2006–09 and the draft Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). Key aspects of this approach in the short term—as
reflected in the 2006 SMP—are to improve the fiscal situation by avoiding new domestic

11

arrears for 2006 as a whole, strengthen technical capacity to prepare and execute
macroeconomic policies, and implement essential structural reforms. The macroeconomic
framework underlying the SMP is based on achieving real GDP growth of 4.2 percent
(about 1½ percent in per capita terms) and an average inflation rate close to 2 percent, in
line with the WAEMU convergence criterion. The authorities noted that the SMP was an
important step in their post-conflict recovery efforts and were confident that a solid track
record of implementing reform policies under the SMP could help restore donor
confidence and pave the way for an EPCA, followed by a PRGF-supported program and
eventual debt relief.

17.
The macroeconomic outlook is expected to improve starting in 2006. Real GDP
growth is projected at about 4 percent in 2006 barring major supply shocks and CPI
inflation at about 2.5 percent, reflecting inflation trends in the WAEMU region. The
external current account deficit is projected to narrow, as strong export growth together
with increased revenues from fishing licenses and worker remittances would only be
partially offset by rising imports, fueled by a recovery in domestic demand and an increase
in foreign-financed public investment, with high import content. The balance of payments

12

deficit is projected to widen to 15.4 percent of GDP, which would be financed by donor
support, accumulation of external arrears, and debt relief.
18.
Medium-term growth will be underpinned by continued strong agricultural
performance and fledgling investments in other sectors as donor assistance resumes
and the policy environment becomes more positive. The authorities expect strong
growth in construction, and industry—particularly cashew nut processing and industrial
fishing activities—which would also help significantly expand Guinea-Bissau’s export
base. Private investment is expected to strengthen as infrastructure constraints (e.g., in
electricity, port facilities, and roads) are partially addressed through real increases in
public investment. Preserving political stability and rehabilitating the central
administration would also improve the business environment. The staff noted that the
consolidation of the recovery would require the authorities to tackle structural weaknesses
in the economy, because business confidence had been badly shaken by conflicts and
political instability. The strengthening fiscal position beyond 2007 would result in a
gradual improvement of national saving over the medium term, leading to a narrowing of
the external current account deficit (including grants) to 6 percent of GDP by 2009 (Text
Table 2).
19.
With monetary and exchange rate policies determined at the regional level,
fiscal policy, supported by structural reforms, will be the main instrument of
macroeconomic policy in Guinea-Bissau. Staff projects that a broadly sustainable fiscal
situation—supported by external debt relief—can reasonably be achieved over the medium
term if there are strong efforts to increase tax revenue and reduce expenditure. In this
scenario, the revenue-to-GDP ratio is assumed to increase steadily, driven mainly by
higher tax revenue, which is projected to reach 13 percent of GDP in 2009. Spending
pressure resulting from increased donor assistance for poverty reduction will be alleviated
by the government’s efforts to curb the growth of discretionary spending and cut the wage
bill, supported by civil service and military reforms. The domestic primary balance would
gradually improve, reaching, by 2009, a level broadly consistent with fiscal sustainability,
assuming the HIPC completion point is reached that same year (Appendix V).8
20.
While the economic outlook has improved, there are downside risks. These
arise from unresolved domestic political and security tensions, weak institutions,
slippages in reforms, and vulnerability to exogenous shocks. In particular, the political
and economic risks related to the medium-term scenario are substantial; much will depend
on the authorities’ commitment to economic reforms. An alternative medium-term
8

mixed picture with some indicators remaining above and others falling below the relevant threshold.

13

scenario, one that recognizes the possibility of prolonged private-sector skepticism and the
absence of external financing, would project output growth at only 2 percent—well below
Guinea-Bissau’s growth potential. If that should occur, per capita income would decline
and debt would not be sustainable.
B. Fiscal Policy and Reforms
21.
In the context of making progress toward fiscal sustainability, the discussion
of short-term fiscal policy centered on achievement of a domestic primary balance
that avoids the accumulation of domestic arrears. The revised 2006 budget targets a
domestic primary deficit of 3.7 percent of GDP, almost half the level of the previous year.
This adjustment is mainly based on higher revenue projections as domestic primary
expenditure is projected to decline only slightly in relation to GDP (Table 2). The overall
deficit on a commitment basis (including grants) is projected to decrease significantly to
6.1 percent of GDP; its financing is consistent—after a further buildup of external
arrears—with a sustainable amount of donor support of 8.2 percent of GDP (Text Table 3
and MEFP, para. 12).
22.
Increasing revenues is key to achieving fiscal sustainability. The authorities
expect to further improve nontax revenue in 2006 by better enforcement of fishing rights
fees and payment for licenses by cell phone operators, particularly during the remainder of
the year. Because tax rates in Guinea-Bissau are not in general below others in the region,
additional revenue would need to come mainly from better administration, for which there
is considerable scope.9 The authorities plan to move faster with planned reforms to
simplify the tax system, widen the tax base, and combat tax evasion (MEFP, paras. 19–
20). The authorities took note of staff concerns about the risks of revenue shortfalls from
some fiscal measures that they are contemplating to promote private investment. They
agreed to proceed gradually with such measures as reducing the corporate income tax from
30 percent to 25 percent, as the report of the World Bank’s Foreign Investment Advisory
Service (FIAS) recommended. They also agreed to eliminate discretionary customs duty
exemptions by strictly limiting exemptions only to those allowed under international
conventions (a structural benchmark under the SMP) and explore the possibility of
recording the remaining exemptions in the budget as tax expenditure to make fiscal
accounting more transparent.
23.
In view of their cash flow difficulties, the authorities intend to further
strengthen budgetary controls, public expenditure management, and cash
management systems so as to avoid new wage and other domestic arrears for the year as
9

14

a whole (MEFP paras. 15–18). They stressed that in the short term the fiscal impact of
their civil service and security reforms would be neutral (MEFP, paras. 11 and 24) as the
projected wage bill reduction would be offset by compensation payments to laid-off
workers and new pensioners.10 While supporting efforts to lower medium-term wage costs,
staff advised that large-scale retrenchment of personnel should be supported by donorassisted civil and security service reforms (see para. 31 below). The authorities expect a
decline in nominal terms of current spending at the primary level due to better control of
discretionary spending. In view of lower-than-expected nontax revenues in the first five
months of the year, the authorities have agreed to lower nonwage current spending below
the level envisaged in the 2006 budget, in order to ensure that the program fiscal targets
are met (MEFP, para 13). A supplementary budget with these measures will be presented
to parliament by end-September 2006, ahead of the first program review.
24.
Domestic financing of the budget deficit is constrained by the government’s
low cash operating balances,

strategy may not prevent temporary
accumulations of domestic arrears
during the year. Nevertheless, given the expected levels of donor funding, the program
would not permit accumulation of domestic arrears for the year as a whole. Staff believes
that this objective is likely to be achieved in view of the government’s commitment to
containing domestic primary spending and the likelihood of a new bond issue in July. 11
25.
The authorities were particularly concerned about settling wage and other
domestic arrears, which they estimated at CFAF 37 billion (21 percent of GDP). They
said that the overhang of wage arrears threatens social stability and undermines their

15

efforts to improve public services and stimulate domestic demand. Given the difficult
financial constraints and the large size of outstanding arrears, the clearance of these arrears
would be a formidable policy challenge. The authorities recognized that previous years’
arrears could be paid in 2006 only if external financing is obtained for their clearance
(MEFP, para. 14). Staff urged the authorities to launch, with donor assistance, a
comprehensive audit of the arrears before seeking financing. Regarding Guinea-Bissau’s
capital contribution to the WAEMU financial institutions, the authorities acknowledged
that, given the weak state of public finances, it would not be possible for Guinea-Bissau to
fully meet these obligations in the near term.12
C. Monetary, Exchange Rate, and Financial Sector Issues
26.
The authorities believe that Guinea-Bissau’s membership in WAEMU has
served the country well, because it helped keep inflation at bay despite severe fiscal
imbalances. Staff agreed that monetary conditions in Guinea-Bissau have been
appropriate, as indicated by continued low inflation.13 On the broader issue of WAEMU
membership, it has been helpful for Guinea-Bissau to have monetary policy conducted at
the regional level by the BCEAO in the context of a common currency pegged to the euro,
given the country’s limited administrative and institutional capacity. Guinea-Bissau has
also benefited from access to the broader regional financial market, rather than being
confined to the limited financing available domestically. Although Guinea-Bissau is
estimated to have missed all convergence indicators established under the WAEMU’s Pact
of Convergence, Stability, Growth, and Solidarity,14 these convergence criteria have
nonetheless served as useful benchmarks in the formulation of fiscal policy. In addition,
the adoption by Guinea-Bissau of the common external tariff, which resulted in a
substantial reduction in its effective tariff rates, has offered the potential for trade
expansion.

12

Under the terms of its accession to the WAEMU in 1998, Guinea-Bissau agreed to contribute an equal share
as the other members in the capital of the central bank (BCEAO) and the regional development bank (BOAD).
The contribution amounting to 50 percent of GDP is to be paid over 25 years starting in 2005, but so far
Guinea-Bissau has failed to make any payment.

13

Nominal interest rates in the WAEMU have remained unchanged since 2004, and the coefficient of reserve
requirements for Guinea-Bissau has been set below the average for the region.

14

The pact sets “primary” or binding targets on the basic fiscal balance, the stock of public debt, inflation, and
government arrears; and a number of “secondary” or indicative targets, such as a ceiling on the wage bill as a
percentage of fiscal revenues (35 percent), a floor on fiscal revenue as a percentage of GDP (17 percent), a floor
of domestically financed investment as a percentage of fiscal revenues (20 percent) and a ceiling on the external
current account deficit as a percentage of GDP (5 percent).

16

27.
The authorities and the staff agreed that the current real effective exchange
rate is likely to be close to its equilibrium level, as indicated by its relative stability
over the past decade and the robust expansion in export volumes, which have grown
at an annual average of 10 percent over the last six years (Figure 1). After joining
WAEMU in 1997, Guinea-Bissau saw its REER appreciate by only slightly more
(5 percent) than the monetary union’s average REER, which staff has estimated to be
broadly in line with the equilibrium level (Figure 6).15 By 2005, the appreciation of
Guinea-Bissau’s REER was similar to the WAEMU-wide REER. Although GuineaBissau’s current account deficits have been sizeable in some years and it has been
accumulating external arrears continuously, these factors do not necessarily indicate an
overvalued exchange rate as long as the country is assumed to reach the HIPC completion
point (with its associated debt
Figure 6. Guinea-Bissau: Real Effective Exchange Rate
relief) in 2009 and to
reestablish access to adequate
concessional external
assistance on a durable basis.
Besides export supply shocks,
the current account deficit has
been partly driven by foreignfinanced investment projects,
which have a high import
content and thus limited
impact on the equilibrium real
exchange rate. Moreover, the
financing gaps in the medium term can be covered by normal flows (Table 4), and no
exceptional financing is expected to be needed following debt relief in 2009, suggesting
that the real exchange rate today is broadly in line with economic fundamentals.

The authorities were concerned that continued appreciation of the euro
against the U.S. dollar would challenge their export competitiveness. Staff indicated
that any sustained deterioration in competitiveness would need to be addressed through
structural reforms to lower the cost of producing tradable goods.
29.
The authorities pointed out that the development of the financial system had
been hampered by persistent political instability in the country, a weak judicial system
and stringent regional financial regulations. However, the BCEAO has recently eased

regulations on single licensing, which would permit two Senegalese banks to enter the
country in 2006 and increase banking competition. As a result, credit to the private sector
is expected to expand in 2006.
D. Structural Reforms
30.
The authorities reaffirmed their commitment to accelerate the pace of
structural reforms needed to bolster Guinea-Bissau’s medium-term growth
prospects. In addition to measures in public finances, the discussions covered reforms in
the civil service and security areas and reforms that would help create a business-friendly
environment.
31.
Recognizing that the current wage bill is unsustainable and could endanger
the fragile macroeconomic stability, the authorities have launched a civil service
reform with the retirement of more than 1,000 employees who had passed the mandatory
retirement age. This is to be followed midyear by identifying civil servants and military
personnel to be laid off during 2006 (MEFP, paras. 24–25, and structural benchmarks).16
Staff recommended that a program to reintegrate former civil servants into the private
sector be outlined and that adequate and timely funding from donors be ensured to
maintain social and political stability. The authorities agreed that, given the lack of
absorptive capacity in the private sector and the high retrenchment costs, a program to
achieve a sustained reduction of the wage bill can only be implemented gradually within a
comprehensive donor-financed medium-term program, to be discussed at a planned
roundtable conference.
32.
Cognizant of the link between security and development, the authorities are
planning the military and security reforms, for which they hope to garner financing
at a donor conference later during the year. The UNDP and other regional and
international partners are helping Guinea-Bissau build stable political institutions and
preparations for military reform have started (MEFP, para. 31). The reforms will start with
a census of the military (a structural benchmark under the SMP), which should be
facilitated by new identification cards to be introduced this year; there will then be a
reduction in staff, mostly lower-rank officers and soldiers who receive salaries equivalent
to the civil servants to be laid off (MEFP, paras. 26–27).
16

The public wage bill, including nonwage benefits, has risen from 6.8 percent of GDP in 2000 to 13.4 percent
in 2005, well above the 7.9 percent average for African countries. The increase in the wage bill was mainly the
result of a salary harmonization process undertaken in 2004 by which salaries of the middle ranks civil service
staff (about 80 percent of civil service employees) were adjusted upward to reduce wage differentials with the
top rank staff. This was followed by a similar salary adjustment of military and paramilitary personnel to levels
comparable to those for the civil service. See Chapter 1 of the selected issues paper.

18

33.
With assistance from the EU and the World Bank, the authorities also plan to
start restoring electricity and water services and rehabilitating Guinea-Bissau’s
infrastructure this year (MEFP, para. 28). They believe that improving infrastructure is
crucial if they are to improve the investment climate, accelerate growth, and reduce
poverty. Staff welcomed the plans for energy reform, privatization of several public
commercial enterprises, and the private sector development initiatives launched with
World Bank support (MEFP, paras. 29–30, and structural benchmark). It stressed that,
given Guinea-Bissau’s membership in a monetary union, structural reform was key to
improving competitiveness and urged steadfast implementation of the planned measures.
E. External Sector and Public Debt
34.
To foster strong growth and reduce vulnerability to commodity price shocks,
value added in the export sector needs to be increased and the export base
diversified. The economy heavily depends on cashew nuts and fishing licenses, and there
is potential for increased value added by moving into cashew processing and industrial
fishing activities.17 The authorities said they intend to seek financing to help the private
sector build capacity, such as by rehabilitating the fishing ports of Bissau and adding coldstorage facilities. They also hoped that Guinea-Bissau’s participation in the U.S. African
Growth and Opportunity Act would add impetus to diversification into nontraditional
exports.
35.
Recent increases in world oil prices have had only a moderate impact on
Guinea-Bissau’s external position because they have been more than offset by strong
commodity prices. The fiscal impact has been negligible because retail margins in fuel
distribution have been squeezed (see Box 1). The authorities have agreed to introduce an
automatic mechanism to adjust the domestic retail price of fuel to world prices, a
benchmark under the program .
36.
Guinea-Bissau, which has accepted obligations under Article VIII, maintains a
system that is free from restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for
current international transactions. Its trade regime conforms to the WAEMU common
regional trade policy. Intraregional trade is essentially free; imports from nonmember
countries are subject to the common external tariff (CET). Recently, the authorities
changed the tax rates applied to some products so that these tariffs are no longer in line
with the CET, but they have requested a waiver from the WAEMU commission. Staff
noted that trade liberalization is best pursued through the authorities working with their
WAEMU partners to reduce the CET, rather than seeking waivers.
17

See Chapter 3 of the selected issues paper for a discussion on the cashew sector.

19

37.
External debt sustainability analysis reveals a country in severe debt distress;
however, if the completion point is achieved before 2010, the risk of debt distress is
expected to fall. The authorities reaffirmed their commitment to making debt service
payments to multilateral institutions to preserve their eligibility for multilateral debt relief
initiatives. Guinea-Bissau reached the decision point for HIPC debt relief in 2000 and will
qualify for the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) once it reaches the completion
point. Given Guinea-Bissau’s unsustainable external debt, staff urged the authorities to
engage in early and collaborative dialogue with creditors so as to achieve a viable solution
to the external debt problem. It welcomed the efforts to reconstitute the external debt
database that was lost during the conflict and saw solid improvements in the capacity and
resources of the external debt unit, based on foreign technical assistance.
38.
The authorities emphasized their commitment to work actively within
WAEMU to promote regional cooperation and economic integration, but said that
political instability had prevented Guinea-Bissau from playing its full part. The country
has not yet implemented the regional directive on harmonization of indirect taxation or
applied five directives on public finances designed to harmonize budget laws and
government accounts and statistics. In 2005, Guinea-Bissau met none of the eight criteria
set by the WAEMU Convergence, Growth and Solidarity Pact, and could not submit
rolling multiyear convergence programs in 2003 and 2004.
F. Capacity Building and the PRSP Process
39.
There is a need to rebuild the country’s institutions and technical capacity.
The authorities recognized the urgency of strengthening institutions to promote political
stability and provide adequate services, for which considerable technical assistance will be
needed. They also expected the recent creation of a Ministry of Economy, whose
responsibilities include technical cooperation with donors, to improve the management of
technical assistance. In reviewing technical assistance needs, staff noted the need to be
alert to capacity constraints when planning the rebuilding, and identified priority areas for
strengthening capacity. It also discussed with the authorities a Statistical Action Plan for
inclusion in the PRSP.
40.
The staff recommended that the technical assistance plan for the Ministry of
Finance be updated. Recent missions from West AFRITAC identified technical
assistance needs in macroeconomic statistics and all areas of fiscal management, the
highest priorities being in the Budget and Customs Departments. But the country’s
capacity to absorb short-term missions is nearing its limits, and the staff concurs with the
authorities that donor support for long-term resident experts is crucial. The authorities
welcomed the IMF’s one-year assignment of a resident advisor on revenue administration,
with donor funding, starting in April 2006.

20

41.
The authorities recognized that reaching the MDGs by 2015 will be a serious
challenge. They outlined the participatory process that will lead in June to validation of
the PRSP and the action plan for 2006 and its submission to Fund and World Bank staff in
September. The PRSP is an ambitious plan to reduce poverty, encompassing a large array
of measures. Staff recommended careful costing of all measures and a realistic timetable
for implementing them. It helped the authorities prepare a central medium-term
macroeconomic framework.
IV. THE 2006 STAFF-MONITORED PROGRAM: MONITORING AND RISKS
42.
In the attached memorandum of economic and financial policies (MEFP), the
authorities indicate their intention to implement for the period April–December 2006
an economic program they have asked Fund staff to monitor (Appendix I,
Attachment I). The actions that were agreed upon as prerequisites are (i) submission to
parliament of a 2006 government budget that is fully consistent with the fiscal program;
and (ii) adoption by the cabinet of organic laws for ministries in the context of the civil
service reform.
43.
The SMP will be monitored through quarterly indicative targets: (i) a ceiling
on domestic financing of the budget; (ii) a floor on revenue; (iii) a ceiling on the wage bill;
(iv) a ceiling on the domestic primary deficit; (v) a ceiling on new domestic arrears,18 and
(vi) ceilings on short- and long-term nonconcessional external debt. The program will also
be monitored through structural benchmarks that have macroeconomic and financial
implications; as the technical memorandum of understanding states, the government will
provide all the data necessary to monitor the program. The staff indicated that discussions
on EPCA could start once a concerted international effort emerged.
44.
The program is subject to a number of risks. The main risk relates to
accumulation of domestic arrears in the event of delays in donor disbursements. In
addition, attaining the revenue target implies a strong enforcement effort to collect fishing
and cell phone license fees. The momentum for civil service and security reform could
also weaken under pressures from the military and the trade unions.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
45.
Guinea-Bissau is at a major crossroads on the way to post-conflict recovery.
While full recovery is expected over the medium term, its strength and timing depend on
18

A new definition of arrears is being used that would imply a one-time reduction in arrears compared to last
year's definition. The change in the definition was made to take into account the need to reflect the normal
length of time to process bills because of limited administrative capacity (technical memorandum of
understanding, TMU).

21

how well the authorities come to grips with the political, fiscal, and structural problems
besetting the country. To enhance prospects of an early recovery, it is crucial that the
authorities improve the economic and financial climate. This will require policies to
restore investor confidence, and a strong commitment to addressing longer-term economic
problems.
46.
The authorities need to redouble the efforts made in recent years to address
the serious economic problems despite the difficult circumstances. The 2006 SMP
should enable Guinea-Bissau to demonstrate its ability to implement a successful
adjustment program and avoid the lapses in program implementation that characterized the
last PRGF-supported program. With steadfast commitment to the SMP, the prospects for
economic recovery and the resumption of external financial assistance are promising. The
authorities should use this opportunity to articulate a medium-term strategy that achieves
fiscal and debt sustainability and addresses the country’s widespread and worsening
poverty.
47.
The 2006 budget makes progress in moving Guinea-Bissau toward fiscal
sustainability. The challenge now facing the authorities is to keep current spending in
check and intensify revenue mobilization. The emphasis on widening the tax base and
reducing exemptions is welcome, but there must also be effective monitoring of spending,
starting from the commitment stage, and strict adherence to a monthly cash flow plan that
is consistent with spending priorities. The authorities must also be judicious in managing
fiscal resources to avoid further accumulation of wage and other domestic arrears that have
caused the country hardship in recent years.
48.
A strategy for addressing domestic and external arrears through adjustment,
debt relief, and donor assistance is needed. The authorities should launch a complete
audit of domestic arrears and seek external resources for their clearance. External debt
service arrears can be addressed only in the context of the HIPC Initiative. The authorities
should continue servicing multilateral debt to preserve their eligibility for the MDRI once
they reach the HIPC completion point, and embark promptly on discussions with creditors
to resolve the external debt problem.
49.
Structural reform, which has languished over the past years, needs new
impetus. Of particular importance is the long-overdue civil service reform launched in
March. While the broad objective of the reform aimed at a durable reduction in the
excessive wage bill is welcome, the authorities should prepare a program for integrating
retrenched workers into the private sector and secure funding from donors so that social
and political stability is maintained. Careful implementation of the planned security sector
reform (with the assistance of some development partners) should also remove a major
constraint on Guinea-Bissau’s development agenda.

22

50.
Membership in the WAEMU has served Guinea-Bissau well. Inflation has been
kept low and the level of the real effective exchange rate seems appropriate, assuming the
HIPC completion point is reached in 2009 and durable access to concessional external
assistance is resumed. Nevertheless, the economy would benefit from a boost in external
competitiveness through further progress on the structural reform agenda. The measures
taken to rehabilitate the electricity company, roads, and other infrastructure, and the recent
initiatives to improve the investment climate are welcome, but these reforms need to be
managed carefully to ensure that limited technical capacity is not overstretched.
51.
Major efforts will be required to rebuild institutional and administrative
capacity. It will be important to ensure coordination of the extensive assistance needs of
the country. The government’s emphasis on good governance and transparency, which are
crucial for restoring relations with donors is welcome.
52.
The mobilization of external assistance will be key to the success of GuineaBissau’s reform efforts and the achievement of external sustainability. The recent
DSA reveals that the country is currently in severe debt distress. Although debt distress is
expected to fall to moderate levels if the HIPC completion point is reached, new assistance
should be provided on highly concessional terms preferably in the form of grants to reduce
the debt burden.
53.
The 2006 SMP entails a number of risks, but on balance, these risks appear
manageable. The risks relate to the accumulation of domestic arrears, particularly if donor
financing is delayed, uncertainty with regard to nontax revenue collection, and the
momentum for civil service and military reform. The government has stressed its
commitment to reform and donors are supportive. Beyond 2006, it will be key for civil and
military service reforms—which entail short-term political risks, but are essential for
Guinea-Bissau's medium-term prospects for stability and growth—to be implemented
according to a well-designed plan and financed with donor assistance.
54.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Guinea-Bissau be held on
the standard 12-month cycle.

23

Box 1. Oil Price Adjustment Mechanism
Guinea-Bissau currently fixes the retail price for petroleum products by decree. To insulate the
population from oil price volatility, the products covered are fuel, diesel, special mixtures, and diesel
reserved for the electricity company. Fixing prices administratively severely distorts the market and
undermines fiscal efforts.
Currently, the authorities do not compensate for losses that retailers may incur when the
administrative price is set lower than the import price. Under the present system, for a given retail
price and tax, the retailer margin changes with the cost of oil. For instance, although gasoline prices
started to increase rapidly in April 2004, the authorities did not raise the domestic retail price until
March 2005. As a result, retailer margins shrank considerably, to the point where they threatened to
discourage gasoline supply. Finally, the authorities adjusted retail prices to avoid shortages and
smuggling. In fact, they then adjusted the price by decree four times in less than two years. The
adjustments were irregular and infrequent, occurring whenever there was pressure on gasoline
supplies.
Staff supported the introduction of an automatic adjustment mechanism and advised that the
mechanism should (i) adjust the retail price transparently based on the actual import price (c.i.f.);
(ii) rely on full and frequent adjustments in order to avoid lengthy delays in the pass-through of
international fuel prices to domestic retail prices; and (iii) synchronize, to the extent possible, the pace
of adjustment with prices in Senegal (which uses a similar mechanism) to prevent smuggling, given
the high degree of integration between the two economies.

APPENDIX I

Bissau, July 3, 2006
Mr. Rodrigo de Rato
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington D.C. 20431
U.S.A.
Dear Mr. de Rato:
1.
Guinea-Bissau has taken important steps to overcome the effects of a long period
of political instability that started with a civil war in 1998–99 and ended with a bloodless
coup by mid-2003. During this period there was a virtual collapse of the government’s
administrative capacity, a significant deterioration of the fiscal stance, and a stagnant
economy. Political and economic stability have been regained since parliamentary and
presidential elections were held in 2004 and 2005. A new government was nominated in
December 2005, and a ruling by the Supreme Court on its constitutionality and subsequent
parliamentary approval of the government program have eased political tensions. In the
context of a staff-monitored program (SMP) in 2005, which this government endorsed, the
country started rebuilding the administrative capacity of the state and stabilizing the
macroeconomic environment.
2.
The priorities of our government are to strengthen public administrative capacity,
enforce adherence to regulations and laws, and prepare the ground for reactivation of
economic growth. The program for 2006, which is part of a broader government program
for 2006–09, in line with the draft Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper intends to improve
the fiscal situation through better tax and public expenditure management so as to avoid
domestic arrears. The program also sets forward macroeconomic policies and structural
reforms that will be key for improving the investment climate and reducing widespread
poverty in the country. Recognizing that a reduction in the wage bill is crucial to achieving
fiscal sustainability, we are starting a civil service and security reform in 2006, aimed at
rationalizing the organizational structures.
3.
In its meeting on Guinea-Bissau on November 19, 2004, the Executive Board of
the IMF concluded that the next step in Fund engagement could be emergency postconflict assistance (EPCA), provided that such assistance was part of a concerted
international effort. Based on the progress we have made thus far, we are confident that
such a concerted effort will emerge later this year, and we intend then to request the start
of discussions on a program that can be supported by the Fund under EPCA. Meanwhile,
we request that the staff of the Fund monitor our economic program, which is expected to

34

APPENDIX I

help us establish a track record of policy performance and pave the way for the postconflict assistance.
4.
The details of the program for 2006 are included in the attached Memorandum on
Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP), which was approved by the Council of
Ministers. The government believes that the policies and measures set forth in the MEFP
are adequate for achieving the objectives of the program, but we will take any further
measures that may become appropriate for that purpose. In such cases, as well as before
implementing policies that could adversely affect the program, we will consult the Fund.
5.
To assist the Fund in assessing progress with implementing the program, we will
provide the required information on a regular basis, as detailed in the attached Technical
Memorandum of Understanding. Moreover, we invite the staff of the Fund to review
performance under the program quarterly, on the basis of the quantitative and structural
indicators (Tables 2 and 4 of the MEFP), as well as on the overall implementation of the
program.

Sincerely yours,

/s/
Víctor Luís Mandinga
Minister of Finance

ATTACHMENT I

MEMORANDUM ON ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES FOR 2006
Bissau, July 3, 2006
I. INTRODUCTION
6.
Building on its program for 2006–09, the draft PRSP (DENARP) and the
Action Plan for 2006, the government of Guinea-Bissau is committed to the goal of
consolidating peace and political stability and laying the foundation for sustainable
high growth and significant poverty reduction. To help achieve these broad objectives
and restore confidence in macroeconomic management, the government intends to pursue
policies under a Fund staff-monitored program during April–December 2006. The
government is determined to take the necessary actions and to intensify its efforts in order
to strengthen the public finance situation, accelerate the implementation of structural
reforms, and improve its financial relations with creditors.
7.
This memorandum describes recent economic developments and provides an
overview of the planned policies and measures for 2006.
II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND PERFORMANCE UNDER THE STAFF-MONITORED
PROGRAM DURING 2005
8.
Despite difficult conditions, progress has recently been made on the political
and security fronts. The approval by parliament of the new government program is an
encouraging sign of support for reforms urgently needed, including civil service and
military reforms. Moreover, the new military leadership has pledged allegiance to the
constitution and its neutrality in political affairs, and reduced internal tensions by
reincorporating senior officers from different military factions of the civil war. However,
the persistence of security risks was highlighted recently by the renewed conflict in the
northern part of the country with rebel factions in Casamance. The government has since
taken stringent security measures to secure its northern border with Senegal.
9.
The economic and financial situation has also shown some improvement,
although serious difficulties remain. Rules-based government has been largely restored
and a start has been made with addressing the fiscal and economic problems. Most
importantly, fiscal control has been reestablished, including by centralizing the
authorization for expenditure commitments in the Ministry of Finance and closing all
government bank accounts outside the central bank (BCEAO). Efforts have also been
made to improve budget preparation and tax administration, which has allowed for a
significant increase in tax revenues.

36

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I

10.
Real GDP growth is estimated to have rebounded to 3.5 percent on the back of
a good performance of cashew nut and grains harvest. Activity in other sectors,
however, remained sluggish. In particular, industry and tourism have lagged behind
because the country lacks basic facilities such as electricity; public administration also did
not contribute to growth as the supply of public services did not improve. Average CPI
inflation rose to 3.4 percent in 2005 reflecting an increase in the prices of imported goods
mainly during the first half of the year. Reflecting a large increase in import and a drop in
private remittances, the external current account balance turned into a deficit of 7.1 percent
of GDP.
11.
The fiscal situation is also improving, but the government continues to face
difficulties in cash flows, due in part to shortfalls in external assistance. The overall
budget deficit (including grants) in 2005 was lower than programmed at 12 percent of
GDP compared to 15 percent in 2004, thanks to a stronger-than-projected tax revenue.
Current primary expenditures were higher than projected, reflecting overruns in the wage
bill, which represented about 75 percent of revenue in 2005. As a result, nonwage current
spending, including to the social sectors, was kept below its budgeted level in 2005. The
improvement in the domestic primary fiscal balance (a program indicator), from a deficit
of 7.6 percent of GDP to 6.9 percent of GDP in 2005, masks a persistent cash flow
problem, as evidenced by the accumulation of new domestic arrears. In the face of delays
in budget support from the World Bank and EU, initially expected during the second
semester of 2005, the government contracted commercial debt amounting to 6.3 percent of
GDP, which allowed for the clearance of part of the new domestic arrears in 2005; but an
outstanding stock of CFAF 4.2 billion of these arrears remained. Moreover, external debt
service, except to the IMF, World Bank, and AfDB remained unpaid.
12.
Performance under the SMP has been mixed. The targets for revenue, domestic
financing and the domestic primary budget deficit (commitment basis) were met. But, the
indicative targets for the wage bill for the year as a whole, and the accumulation of new
domestic arrears were breached (Table 2). Progress on structural reform was also mixed,
reflecting serious technical capacity constraints and delays in obtaining technical
assistance, and the change in government. Only 6 out of the 10 structural benchmarks were
met (Table 3).
III. OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES FOR 2006
13.
Consolidating the fragile peace and political stability require maintaining
macroeconomic stability and implementing deeper structural reforms. The policies
for 2006 aim at improving the fiscal situation, restoring confidence in macroeconomic
management, and strengthening technical capacity in preparing and implementing
macroeconomic policies.

37

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I

14.
The macroeconomic framework underlying the staff-monitored program
(SMP) is based on the achievement of real GDP growth of 4.2 percent, higher than
the population growth rate; and an average annual inflation rate close to 2 percent,
in line with the WAEMU convergence criterion. In addition to preserving recent gains
in real per capita income, the SMP also aims to support poverty reduction by accelerating
the pace of priority spending within the scope of the existing budget.
Fiscal policies
15.
The government is committed to pursuing a prudent fiscal policy. Revenue as
a percentage of GDP is projected to increase by about 3 percentage points, reflecting better
enforcement of fishing licenses, payment of licenses by cell phone operators, and
continued improvement of customs administration controls implemented since 2005.
Domestically financed expenditures are projected to decrease as a proportion of GDP with
respect to 2005. As a result, the overall deficit (including grants) is projected to fall to
6.1 percent of GDP from 12 percent in 2005. Mainly reflecting large scheduled external
debt service amounting to CFAF 19.7 billion (11.4 percent of GDP), of which debt relief
covers only CFAF 5.7 billion (3.3 percent of GDP), the budget for 2006 shows an overall
financing gap of CFAF 26.8 billion (17.2 percent of GDP) for this year. Taking into
account debt service payments that will fall into arrears, the financing gap for 2006
amounts to CFAF 14.2 billion.
16.
On the expenditure side, the government’s policy is aimed at reining in
discretionary spending in order to free the resources needed to address the increasing
needs of the poorest population groups in the areas of health and education, as well
as to maintain and improve basic infrastructure. Accordingly, budgeted current
primary expenditure as a ratio to GDP will be reduced by 1.9 percentage points, while
domestically-financed investment expenditure will be increased by 1.3 percentage points
over the outturn for 2005. The wage bill is expected to decline by CFAF 2.1 billion as a
result of the implementation of the first phase of the civil service reform marked by the
retrenchment of nearly 2,800 civil servants. However, transfers are projected to rise by
about CFAF 3.3 billion, reflecting partly the cost associated with such program.
17.
With the parliamentary approval of the government program as a sign of an
emerging broader consensus for reforms, the outlook for new financing has
improved. The European Union’s budget support amounting to CFAF 7.7 billion is
expected for disbursement in April and December, and the regional organizations
(WAEMU and ECOWAS) began in February the disbursement of a budget support
amounting to CFAF 5.5 billion to help cover wage payments in March 2006, settle debt
service due to the IMF and World Bank and pay past arrears. However, the postponed
budget support under preparation by the World Bank amounting to CFAF 5.5 billion is not

38

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I

expected until December, 2006. Assistance for 0.3 percent of GDP by China has already
been received. The government also intends to contact its external creditors to seek
solutions to the high external debt payments. This, combined with additional external
resources from the multidonor-supported EEMF, would allow the gap to be fully covered.
18.
In view of the weakness in nontax revenue performance observed during the
first five months of the year, in order to ensure program targets are met, the
government has undertaken additional expenditure cuts beyond those included in the
2006 budget. These measures, which will become effective immediately, comprise
reductions in transfers of CFAF 600 million and in other nonwage expenditures of
CFAF 500 million. The government will submit to parliament by end-September 2006, an
amendment to the budget law to reflect these adjustment measures.
19.
In line with the budget, the government does not anticipate the payment of
previous years’ arrears in 2006, unless specific external financing for their clearance
is obtained.19 The government intends to launch with donor assistance, a comprehensive
audit of these arrears and seek external financing for their clearance later. Meanwhile, a
program of wage arrears clearance will be prepared during 2006. If a donor financial
assistance is found, this program will be executed in consultation with Fund staff.
However, the government’s first priority would be to avoid the accumulation of new
arrears.
Public expenditure management
20.
The government recognizes the need to improve budget execution and cash
flow management, with the twofold objective of improving public expenditure
management and preventing the accumulation of domestic and external payments
arrears. Short-term fiscal policy will thus focus on avoiding new domestic arrears over
the year as a whole, within the framework of a day-to-day fiscal management on the basis
of a strict cash management system. A circular has been issued by the Prime Minister to
strengthen the mandate of the Treasury Committee, in charge of implementing the cash
flow plan. The Treasury Committee will be guided by a cash-flow plan for 2006 (Table 1),
based on the budget for 2006. Starting immediately and in cooperation with the BCEAO,
the movements in the treasury accounts will be reconciled with the expenditure allocations
of the Treasury Committee and authorized commitments by the Budget Department on a
daily basis.

19

Some domestic claims on government from 2000–05, mainly wages, were settled selectively during the first
quarter of 2006, to reduce political tensions.

39

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I

21.
The government will also ensure that all expenditure commitments,
irrespective of their actual payment, will be entered in the accounting system
maintained by the Budget Department without delay. In order to follow budget
execution, the Ministry of Finance will, within two weeks after the end of each month,
prepare a report comparing the budget and actual expenditure by main budget category.
The government will further strengthen budgetary control procedures. It will provide
support for external audits of the government’s end-year treasury accounts by the Audit
Court, and parliamentary examination of budget review laws within the timeframe
specified by WAEMU directives. In order to increase transparency and donor confidence,
the government has allowed the UNDP and the EU to participate in the Treasury
Committee as observers.
22.
While the cash rationing system is expected to help avoid new arrears on
discretionary expenditure items, temporary arrears on nondiscretionary items may
arise during the year. The large share in expenditure of wages and other nondiscretionary
outlays, the concentration of tax revenue in the middle of the year, and the concentration
of World Bank and other donor financing during the second semester, imply that, without
additional financing, new arrears (on a commitment basis) on these expenditure categories
may arise during the first part of the year. At the end of the complementary period of the
budget execution for 2005, these arrears, salaries included, amounted to CFAF 4.1 billion.
Clearing such arrears will get the highest priority when new financing is found.
23.
The government has introduced since 2002 a procurement reform program in
the public sector with the assistance from the Netherlands. After being successfully
implemented in five pilot ministries (education, health, finance, agriculture, and
infrastructure) with the creation of a General Directorate of Public Procurement (DGCP)
and a National Committee for monitoring public contracts (CNCS) in 2002 and 2004,
respectively, the reform will be extended to the rest of the public sector in 2006 with
assistance from the World Bank in the context of its support to low-income countries
under stress (LICUS). Moreover, public finance management in Guinea-Bissau is still
governed by outdated laws adopted back in 1986. The government will strive to align the
country’s legal and regulatory framework with the WAEMU norms.
Tax reforms
24.
The government intends to continue with tax reforms initiated by the previous
government. There is considerable scope to generate additional revenue from better
administration. The main measures envisaged under the current budget include, tightened
customs control through the verification of import declarations at main destination sites
(where control is more effective) instead of at the border for goods entering the country by
land, and declaration and payment of export taxes before exportation takes place. Efforts

40

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I

will also be pursued to strengthen control over the payment of customs tariffs, including
for petroleum products and rice. The Customs Department will step up regional
cooperation, including for the valuation for tax purposes of rice imports. Custom
exemptions, which represented nearly 40 percent of total custom revenue, will be reduced
by putting an end to discretionary exemptions. The government intends to record these
exemptions in customs revenue and register the counterpart tax spending in the budget.
25.
The planned fiscal reform for 2006 aims to simplify the tax system, widen the
tax base, promote investment and competitiveness, promote voluntary compliance,
and combat tax evasion. The process of simplifying the tax system started with the
elimination of several low-yielding taxes in the budget for 2005. Corporate income tax
rates were already unified and a minimum tax was introduced for companies that are
unable to provide a balance sheet.20 The banderole system for alcoholic beverages and
cigarettes, a structural benchmark under the program, will be implemented by endJuly 2006. These reforms will be continued in 2006 in close cooperation with measures to
improve the investment climate. Following up on the recommendations of the World
Bank’s Foreign Investment Advisory Service (FIAS) Department report, the government
intends to reduce the effective marginal tax rate by lowering the corporate income tax from
30 percent in 2005 to 25 percent in 2006. This measure is only expected to impact revenue
collection in 2007, when taxes on 2006 corporate profits are paid. With the view to
improve revenues, the government intends to strengthen corporate taxes by making cashew
nut exporters pay their taxes in advance.
26.
The government recently implemented a reduction in tariffs and sales tax for
a number of products it considers to be heavily weighted in the consumption basket
of the population (including rice, wheat, sugar, cement, and gas), and thus could have
a strong impact on poverty. Some of these measures brought the tariff classification out
of line with the WAEMU common external tariff. The government has requested a waiver
from the WAEMU commission for these specific cases. These fiscal measures will have a
moderate revenue impact in 2006, while contributing to reduce fraud and tax evasion.
Regarding export taxes on cashews, cooperation between the ministries of Finance and
Commerce will be strengthened to ensure that the reference price for taxation of such
exports closely reflects actual prices.
27.
Measures will be taken to protect and increase revenue from the fishing
sector, which accounts for more than one-fourth of government revenue. Surveillance
20

With assistance from AFRITAC, a Large-Taxpayers Unit (LTU) has been set up; allowing for the
centralization of tax accounts from large firms in a single file, by requiring the submission of their end-of-year
financial statements and balance sheet. A minimum rate of 0.5 percent of total sales is imposed on those firms
declaring zero or negative profits.

41

ATTACHMENT I

of territorial waters will be stepped up with the repair of two boats, and the acquisition of
additional monitoring equipment. The latter is part of a US$3 million, four-year project
financed by AfDB that started in 2005, and includes the construction of a port for fishing
vessels, acquisition of additional boats, fish processing facilities, and training, among
others. The Scientific Project for Fisheries financed by the EU will also contribute
significantly to the development of this sector: a survey of the stock of fish and shrimp was
carried out in 2005, and another one is planned for this year that will allow the authorities
to estimate the rate of depletion of this resource; and assistance programs for local
fishermen include provision of fishing and storage equipment. Moreover, agreements
under which fishing licenses are obtained against payments in kind or for settling
government obligations were stopped in 2005 and any new agreement will be based on
monetary payment only. All fishing agreements will be harmonized. These measures are
also supported by the EU, World Bank, and the AfDB.
IV. STRUCTURAL REFORMS, GOVERNANCE, AND TRANSPARENCY
28.
The severity of Guinea-Bissau’s problems implies that they can only be solved
durably through deeper structural reforms over the medium term and with donor
assistance. In addition to structural reforms in taxation and public expenditure
management, the government remains committed to implementing a reform of the public
administration (civil and military) and other structural measures such as privatization and
energy reform. It will aim at improving governance and transparency in all its operations.
To accelerate growth and meet substantial demand for social services, the government has
also launched a number of private sector development initiatives.
Civil service reform
29.
The key element in reducing expenditure is personnel costs. At about
75 percent of revenue, the high level of personnel expenditure is the main reason for the
serious fiscal problems, and it also leaves little room for social policies and for promoting
higher economic growth. The principal causes of the high wage bill are excessive levels of
public sector employment and high level staff, as the average wage does not appear to be
out of line with respect to other countries in WAEMU.21 However, the reduction in
personnel costs must be implemented in the context of a comprehensive public sector
reform program. A new census conducted in 2005 has revealed a total of about
12,000 civil servants.22 The results of this census are now being compared with the payroll
21

Preliminary estimates indicate that the average wage is about one-fifth of the average public sector wage in
Senegal while GDP per capita in Guinea-Bissau is approximately one-fourth of that in Senegal.

22

A harmonization in wages conducted in mid-2004 led to an increase in the total wage bill in spite of the
decreased number of staff.

42

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I

maintained by the Ministry of Finance. Starting in July 2006, a new test-based
appointment of key administrative posts will be launched with the objective of replacing
political appointees by competent civil servants in the highest areas of responsibilities.
30.
The government intends to accelerate the pace of the reform starting with
the 2006 budget. It will be based on a Public Sector Reform Law, which will be adopted
by the Council of Ministers in July, following the adoption of organic laws for the various
ministries. A steering committee, chaired by the Prime Minister and including
representatives of the labor unions, employers organizations, and civil society, has also
been recently established. Several donors, including the EU, the UNDP and Portugal, have
announced support for the program, and additional support will be sought at the time of the
Round Table conference. The reform will be implemented in two stages. The first stage
started in June 2006 with the retirement of more than 1,000 employees, of which 391 had
already passed the mandatory retirement age in 2005. In addition, a freeze on new hiring
and promotions will take effect. These wage bill reduction efforts, will be complemented
during the rest of the year by identifying civil servants and military personnel who need to
be laid off during 2006. In the second stage of the reform, a program of re-insertion in the
private sector will be launched, with assistance from donors. A number of initiatives will
be enacted to facilitate private sector absorption of these workers.
Military and security reform
31.
The government believes that the reforms of the security sector are a
necessary condition for securing lasting peace and moving ahead with its
development agenda. It also recognizes the positive impact of such reforms on the public
finances. The size of the military increased sharply as a result of the war; about
4,000 military were retrenched under the post-conflict demobilization program (PDRRI),
but the number of military is still high, nearly 5,000 by some estimates. Despite efforts to
harmonize the wage scales with the civilian administration, the wage bill for the military
has remained excessive.
32.
Following a mission by the U.K. security sector development advisory team in
October 2005, the government issued on February 7, 2006 a decree creating an interministerial committee on security sector reform. Subsequently, a steering committee,
chaired by the Minister of Defense was set up to orient the work of a technical team and
approve its proposals before submitting them to the cabinet. Meanwhile, the government
intends to conduct in July 2006 a census of the military—in preparation for a military
reform program—and identify the contractual workers, who will be incorporated into the
civil service or laid off. A census of the paramilitary for the entire country has been
completed.

43

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I

Other structural reforms and private sector development initiatives
33.
Improving the outlook for economic growth requires repairing the damage
from the conflict at the outset. The EU is financing the rehabilitation of roads, while the
World Bank is preparing assistance to rehabilitate the electricity company and other
infrastructure. The government will submit an electricity bill to parliament in July 2006,
which aims at reforming the institutional framework of the sector, opening financial bids
for a long-term leasing contract of the power and utility (EAGB), and creating an
independent regulatory agency. The government intends to seek donor assistance with the
rehabilitation of the commercial and fishing ports of Bissau and cold-storage facilities, as
well as with repairing and re-equipping the many schools that were destroyed during the
conflict.
34.
The rehabilitation efforts will be supported by policies to improve the
investment climate. An action plan for simplifying procedures for trade and investment, is
being implemented under the World Bank-financed project for the rehabilitation and
development of the private sector (PRDSP). Recent initiatives aimed at removing obstacles
to private investment include (i) a review of the Investment Code; (ii) adhesion to MIGA
and other FDI-guarantees agencies such as FAGACE; (iii) the introduction of a single stop
for potential investors; (iv) the preparation of a draft law on build-operate-transfer (BOT)
procedures for projects requiring public/private partnerships; (v) creation of export
processing zones; (vi) elimination of administrative barriers; (vii) elimination of most
license (fee) requirements for the industrial and commercial sector, including for imports
and exports; (viii) identification and elimination of remaining constraints for private sector
involvement in strategic sectors such as cashew nut production and processing, the fishing
sector, and rice and fruit and vegetable production. Labor laws will be brought in line with
the provisions of the Organization for the Harmonization of Trade Legislation in Africa
(OHADA).
35.
The government has also initiated a privatization program aimed at reducing
state participation in commercial and production activities. Starting with the 2006
budget, some 14 companies with a total market value of CFAF 2.6 billion, including two
hotels, will be brought to the point of sales. Privatization will be carried out in a
transparent manner, using public bidding procedures.
Governance and transparency
36.
Promoting good governance will remain a cornerstone of government policies.
The UN system has taken the lead in providing assistance in promoting political stability,
supported by ECOWAS, the CPLP, and other international partners. Key immediate issues
are military reform and political institution and capacity building, but also improving good

44

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I

governance and transparency, the lack of which was a major factor behind the civil war.
To enhance fiscal accountability, the government will continue to: (i) apply rules and
regulations in government operations; (ii) strengthen the political and democratic
institutions, including at a local level; (iii) apply measures to increase the efficiency and
effectiveness of government administration; and, (iv) strengthen with donor assistance, the
judiciary system; and (v) reinforce the means and independence of the audits court to
allow it to perform its control of budget execution.
37.
To improve transparency in public finances, the Ministry of Finance will
continue publishing monthly a summary table on fiscal developments, which started
in July 2005. More generally, the National Committee for Social Cooperation—which is
chaired by the Prime Minister and includes trade unions and employer organizations—will
be reactivated and meet regularly to discuss economic developments and reform policies.
38.
The promotion of regional integration is one of the central elements of the
government’s economic policy. The government remains committed to the
implementation of policies required to meet the objectives under the WAEMU’s
Convergence, Growth and Solidarity Pact. Given its prolonged economic crisis, GuineaBissau was unable to respect any of the eight convergence criteria set by WAEMU at end2005. Little progress has also been achieved with respect to the other regional initiatives.
While the common external tariff was adopted in 2000, the country continue to avail itself
of the safeguard measures allowed under the CET. The five directives on the public
finances, and the directive on the harmonization of indirect taxes have still not been
applied. However, the government intends to request technical assistance in tax
administration, with a view to introducing a single-rate value-added tax in 2007.
Financial sector issues
39.
The government will also continue efforts to strengthen the financial system,
whose landscape has been shaped by the establishment of a new commercial bank
(Banco da União, BDU) and a policy bank (the regional solidarity bank, BRS), since
February 2006 and December 2005, respectively. It is expected that two commercial
banks from the WAEMU region will take advantage of the single licensing law and open
branches in Bissau by end-2006. The BRS will focus on the financing of microprojects.
The Ministry of Finance will support and supervise the development of microfinance, and
prudential supervision of the banks will be provided through the BCEAO and the
WAEMU’s Banking Commission. The banking system remains reasonably sound,
although credit concentration poses a vulnerability risk for the sector.
40.
Guinea-Bissau made recourse to the regional market for short-term
government paper for the first time in October 2005. The treasury collected

45

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I

CFAF 6 billion (about 4 percent of GDP) by issuing a six-month treasury bill that was
mostly subscribed by banks outside Bissau at a rate of 5.5 percent. These bills have been
repaid only partially, due to delays in the ECOWAS disbursement. Over the medium term,
the government intends to issue treasury bills for liquidity purposes and also to support
financial market development in the region.
External debt issues
41.
The budget is burdened by high internal and external debt service obligations.
The main element in domestic debt concerns the commitment, following Guinea-Bissau’s
accession to the WAEMU, to contribute to the capital of the BCEAO and the Monetary
Agency of West Africa, and the West African Development Bank (BOAD); this debt
amounts to CFAF 70 billion (40 percent of GDP), to be paid over 25 years, starting
June 2005. However, at about 10 percent of projected annual revenue for the coming
years, these payments would seriously undermine the ability to improve the fiscal
situation. Therefore, the government intends to seek assistance from its partners to clear
the payment arrears of 2005 and reduce payments for 2006 (still pending) and 2007; a
longer-term solution will be sought at the time of the Round Table conference.
42.
The external debt problem can only be resolved in the context of the HIPC
Initiative. Without debt relief, annual debt service payments amount to more than half of
annual revenue. The government intends to continue to cooperate closely with the IMF in
order to allow returning to a program that can be supported under the PRGF in the future,
which would also allow debt relief under the HIPC Initiative to resume. In the interim, it
will undertake every effort to remain current on debt service, especially to multilaterals
and those creditors that can provide new assistance. In this context, efforts are ongoing to
set up with interested donors a multilateral debt-service fund that will help the country
honor its obligations vis-à-vis its multilateral creditors in the perspective of the MDRI for
which Guinea-Bissau is eligible. Moreover, the government will engage in an early and
collaborative dialogue with the other creditors so as to achieve a viable solution to the
external debt problem until this can be addressed under the HIPC Initiative. Any new
external debt will be on strictly concessional terms, with a grant element of at least
50 percent. The external debt database is in the process of being rebuilt and debt
management strengthened, with technical assistance from Debt Relief International.
V. SOCIAL POLICIES AND THE PRSP PROCESS
43.
The government is firmly committed to the Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs), which are clearly reflected in its Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP).
To that end, the growth and development objectives underlying its economic and financial
program for 2006 were based on the guidelines specified in the PRSP. The government's

46

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I

PRSP for 2006–09 indicates a core objective of reducing poverty from its current level of
two-thirds to a substantially low level by 2015, and at the same time makes progress
toward reaching MDGs in education, literacy, health, water, sanitation, and housing. The
strategy has four pillars: (i) strengthening governance, modernizing the public
administration and enhancing macroeconomic stability; (ii) promoting economic growth
and job creation; (iii) improving the access to basic social services; and (iv) improving
living conditions for vulnerable groups. The document is expected to be finalized and
submitted to the respective Executive Boards of the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund in the second half of 2006. The government intends to seek donor
assistance in implementing these policies at a Round Table conference, which is
tentatively planned for November 2006.
44.
In line with the government’s poverty strategy, social policies aim at
increasing access to primary health care and basic education, implementing specific
poverty alleviation measures and improving the opportunities for employment. One
in five children does not reach the age of five. Moreover, HIV/AIDS is a major threat to
the future of Guinea-Bissau, where knowledge of this disease and its prevention is
minimal. Further, about 70 percent of the population cannot read or write. In the health
sector, efforts aim at improving primary health care, and especially at the fight against
malaria. The government is also planning to increase HIV/Aids awareness, to improve the
training of health-care workers, regulate pharmaceutical activities, and update the
diagnosis and treatment database. In education, the main priorities are the rehabilitation of
classrooms and teacher training. The government has received support in these areas from
the World Bank and other donors.
VI. CAPACITY BUILDING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
45.
The country’s institutions and technical capacity need to be largely rebuilt.
The civil war and its aftermath resulted in a severe weakening of the institutions required
for a democracy and a market-based economy, many of which were still being built up
before the war. Moreover, many educated and experienced cadre left the civil service and
the country. Strengthening is urgently needed to promote political stability, and to provide
adequate government services, for which considerable technical assistance will be needed.
As a first step, the government has requested donor assistance for the preparation of a
comprehensive country technical assistance plan to identify priority areas.
46.
Recent missions from the World Bank and the IMF—including by its regional
technical assistance center West AFRITAC—identified technical assistance needs in
all areas of fiscal management as well as in macroeconomic statistics (Table 5); the
highest priority is assistance to the Budget and Customs Departments. Short-term
missions are reaching the limits of absorption capacity, and the government’s especially

47

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I

seeking donor support for assigning long-term resident experts. Such experts will be
assigned qualified counterparts, who will be allowed to stay in their function for a
sufficient period to allow technical expertise to be transferred. In this vein, the one-year
assignment of a resident advisor on revenue administration by the IMF (with donor
funding), to start work in Bissau in April 2006, is expected to contribute significantly to
the strengthening of the Ministry of Finance.
47.
It will be important to ensure adequate coordination of the extensive
assistance needs, which may require involvement of multiple donors. A first step in
this direction has been the preparation of the Action Plan in 2005, which should become
the common framework for donor assistance. Moreover, while the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs will remain responsible for overall relations with donors, the Ministry of Economy
will be in charge of coordinating technical cooperation with donors.
VII. PROGRAM MONITORING
48.
The monitoring of progress with implementing the program outlined above
will be based on the quantitative and structural indicators provided in Tables 2 and
4. The quantitative targets are (i) a ceiling on domestic financing of the budget; (ii) a floor
on budgetary revenue; (iii) a ceiling on the wage bill; (iv) a ceiling on the domestic
primary deficit; (v) a ceiling on new domestic arrears; and (vi) ceilings on public sector
short- and long-term nonconcessional external debt. The structural benchmarks relate to
the strengthening of tax administration and collection, and improving transparency in
public finance developments. The government will provide all necessary data to monitor
the program as indicated in the technical memorandum of understanding. To ensure the
success of the program, the government has taken the following prior actions:
(a) submission of the 2006 government budget to parliament; and (b) adoption by the
cabinet of organic laws in the context of the civil service reform.

TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING FOR THE STAFF-MONITORED PROGRAM
FOR 2006
Bissau, July 3, 2006
49.
This memorandum describes the definitions of the quantitative indicators for the
staff-monitored program (SMP) for 2006 (Table 2) of the Memorandum on Economic and
Financial Policies (MEFP) in accordance with the understandings reached between the
authorities of Guinea-Bissau and the staff of the IMF. It also specifies the agreed
periodicity and deadlines for transmission of data to the staff of the IMF for program
monitoring purposes.
VIII. QUANTITATIVE INDICATORS AND ADJUSTORS
A. Quantitative Indicators
50.

The quantitative indicators (Table 2 of the MEFP) are the following:
a. cumulative floors on government revenue;
b. cumulative ceilings on the government wage bill;
c. cumulative floors on the domestic primary fiscal balance (on a commitment basis);
d. cumulative ceilings on new domestic payments arrears of the
government, including wage arrears.
e. cumulative ceilings on the change in net domestic financing of the budget; and
f. cumulative ceilings on new nonconcessional external debt contracted or
guaranteed by the government.

Quantitative indicators have been set for end-July, end-October, and end-December 2006,
and their values are cumulative from January 1, 2006. Indicative targets for new
nonconcessional external debt are continuous.

Definitions and computation
51.
For the purposes of the SMP, the government is defined as the central
government of Guinea-Bissau. This definition excludes public entities with autonomous
legal personality whose own budget is not included in the central government budget.
52.
For the SMP, government revenue includes all tax and nontax receipts and
excludes external grants. The cash-flow estimates are based on the revenue estimates in
the approved budget for 2006, which are adjusted for revenue items that are offset by
corresponding expenditure or financing items. In particular, an adjustment is made for the
revenue from the European Union that is earmarked for the fishing project
(CFAF 656 million, offset in domestically financed capital expenditure).
53.
The SMP uses a broad definition for the targeted ceiling on the government
wage bill. The wage bill as understood under the program target includes (i) all staff
(permanent and temporary) of the civil service and the military and paramilitary, and
encompasses the budget categories 01.01.00 (gross wages) and 01.02.00 (bonuses and
subsidies); (ii) payments for food (budget category 02.02.04); and (iii) transfers to
embassies for expenditures on personnel (budget category 03.07.01.1). The quarterly
targets are given in Table 1 below.

54.
The domestic primary fiscal balance on a commitment basis is based on the
cash-flow estimates provided in Table 1 of the MEFP. It is calculated as the difference
between the revenue defined in para. 4 of this TMU and domestic primary expenditure on
a commitment basis. The latter consists of current expenditure plus domestically-financed
capital expenditure (corrected for the EU-financed expenditure for the fishing project),

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT II

55

excluding all interest payments, externally financed capital expenditure, and the capital
contribution to WAEMU financial institutions. Government commitments include all
expenditure for which commitment vouchers have been approved by the Ministry of
Finance; automatic expenditure (such as wages and salaries, pensions, utilities, and other
expenditure for which payment is centralized); and expenditure by means of offsetting
operations. The estimated July, October, and December domestic primary balances
for 2006 are provided in Table 2 below.

55.
New domestic payments arrears of the government are defined as any of the
following: i) Any bill that has been received by the spending ministry from a supplier of
goods and services, delivered and verified and for which, payment has not been made
within 90 days after the due date of payment, unless otherwise stipulated in the contract
between the suppliers and the government; ii) wages and salaries and any payment to a
government employee that were due to be paid in a given month but remained unpaid on
the thirtieth day of the following month.
56.
Net domestic financing of the budget is defined based on the cash-flow
estimates in Table 1 of the MEFP. Bank financing consists of the net changes in the
balances in the treasury accounts at the BCEAO and at the commercial bank(s)—
excluding balances in those accounts that are not freely available for budget financing,
such as accounts that are held under double signature arrangements with donors—as well
as in the outstanding amounts of loans from the BCEAO and the commercial bank(s).
Domestic nonbank financing encompasses changes in debt owed to projects, changes in
the stock of treasury bills placed in the domestic (regional) market, loans from foreign
commercial banks within the WAEMU region, and privatization receipts, as well as any
other domestic financial debt held outside the banking sector, other than arrears, that may
arise. Table 3 below provides the details.

57.
The indicators for external debt are cumulative ceilings on new
nonconcessional external debt contracted or guaranteed by the government. For the
purposes of the SMP, the definitions of “debt” and “concessional borrowing” are as
follows:
a. The indicator for external debt applies not only to debt as defined in point No. 9 of
the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt, adopted by the
Executive Board of the IMF on August 24, 2000 but also to commitments contracted
or guaranteed for which value has not been received. For purposes of these
guidelines, the term “debt” is understood to mean a current, that is, not contingent,
liability, created under a contractual arrangement through the provision of value in
the form of assets (including currency) or services, and which requires the obligor to
make one or more payments in the form of assets (including currency) or services, at
some future point(s) in time; these payments will discharge the principal and/or
interest liabilities incurred under the contract. Debts can take a number of forms, the
primary ones being as follows: (i) loans, that is, advances of money to the obligor by
the lender made on the basis of an undertaking that the obligor will repay the funds in
the future (including deposits, bonds, debentures, commercial loans, and buyers’
credits) and temporary exchanges of assets that are equivalent to fully collateralized
loans, under which the obligor is required to repay the funds, and usually pay interest,

57

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT II

by repurchasing the collateral from the buyer in the future (such as repurchase
agreements and official swap arrangements); (ii) suppliers’ credits, that is, contracts
where the supplier permits the obligor to defer payments until some time after the
date on which the goods are delivered or services are provided; and (iii) leases, that
is, arrangements under which property is provided that the lessee has the right to use
for one or more specified period(s) of time that are usually shorter than the total
expected service life of the property, while the lesser retains the title to the property.
For the purpose of the guideline, the debt is the present value (at the inception of the
lease) of all lease payments expected to be made during the period of the agreement,
excluding those payments that cover the operation, repair, or maintenance of the
property. Under the definition of debt set out above, arrears, penalties, and judicially
awarded damages arising from the failure to make payment under a contractual
obligation that constitutes debt are debt. Failure to make payment on an obligation
that is not considered debt under this definition (e.g., payment on delivery) will not
give rise to debt. For the purposes of monitoring the SMP, arrangements to pay over
time obligations arising form judicial awards to external creditors do not constitute
nonconcessional external borrowing.
b. Loan concessionality is assessed on the basis of the commercial interest
reference rates (CIRRs) established by the OECD. A loan is said to be on
concessional terms if, on the initial date of contraction of the loan, the ratio of the
present value of the loan, calculated on the basis of the reference interest rates, to its
nominal value is less than 50 percent (that is, a grant element of at least 50 percent).
For debts with a maturity exceeding 15 years, the ten-year reference interest rate
published by the OECD is used to calculate the grant element. For shorter maturities,
the six-month market reference rate is used. Purchases from the IMF are excluded
from this limit.
58.
The concept of government for the purposes of the indicators on external debt
is broader than the one used for the budget aggregates, including all debt that may
ultimately be deemed to be a liability of the state. In addition to the government as
defined in para. 3, the definition includes administrative public institutions, public
enterprises authorized to contract, guarantee, or accommodate nonconcessional borrowing,
scientific and technical public institutions, professional public institutions, industrial
and/or commercial public institutions and local governments.
B. Adjusters
59.

The following adjusters will be in effect:

58

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT II

•

The floors on revenue will be fully adjusted for advances or delays in the EU’s
compensation for fishing rights compared to the assumptions underlying the
program. The program assumes payments of CFAF 4.8 billion in December 2006.

•

The floors on the domestic primary fiscal balance (on a commitment basis) will
be adjusted in line with the external budget support. In particular, the floor on the
domestic primary balance will be lowered in case of higher budget support than
programmed, for the full amount of the excess. The program assumes external budget
support of (cumulative from January 1, 2006) CFAF 9.1 billion by end-July 2006,
CFAF 12.4 billion by end-October 2006 and CFAF 19.9 billion by endDecember 2006.
The ceiling on domestic financing will be adjusted in line with the adjustment of
external budget support. In particular, the ceiling will be increased in the case of
shortfall in external budget support, by the full amount of the shortfall. The program
assumes external budget support of (cumulative from January 1, 2006)
CFAF 9.1 billions by end-July 2006, CFAF 12.4 billion by end-October 2006, and
CFAF 19.9 billion by end-December 2006.

•

IX. PROGRAM MONITORING
60.
To allow monitoring of developments under the program, the Ministry of
Finance will regularly report the following information to the staff of the IMF:
•

The monetary survey, the balance sheet of the central bank, and the balance sheet of
the commercial banks, (monthly, within six weeks following the end of the month);

•

The net claims on the government held by the banking system, including details on
the balances in the treasury accounts freely available for budget financing (the
treasury account, the solidarity account, and the special account) (monthly, within ten
days of the end of the month);

•

The monthly report of the Treasury Committee, including tables on revenue by tax
and expenditure by budget line, and a table, reconciling the revenue and expenditure
data with the changes in the treasury accounts at the BCEAO (monthly, within ten
days after the end of the month);

•

The detailed reports on revenue and expenditure by budget line and a completed
summary table on central government operations (TOFE) monthly, two weeks after
the end of the month;

•

A monthly table providing the end-of-period stock of unpaid bills by the treasury
(RAP), sorted out by budget category (wages, goods and services, etc.); and payment
delays (i.e., period in which payment orders were made);

59

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT II

•

The amount and terms of new external debt (concessional or not) contracted or
guaranteed by the government (within four weeks after the end of the month);

•

A monthly table on the disbursements of budget support (grants and loans), by donors
(two weeks after the end of the month);

•

Indicators to assess overall economic trends, such as the household consumer price
index and exports of cashew nuts (when such information becomes available);

•

A table with a description of the status of implementation of the structural indicators
in Table 4 of the MEFP (within two weeks after the end of the month); and

•

Information on any type of financial assistance received and not programmed. This
should be reported on a continuous basis.

The Ministry of Finance will provide the staff of the IMF with any other
information that the Ministry or the staff of the IMF deem necessary for programmonitoring purposes.

61.

The above data will be provided to the Assistant-Economist at the local office
of the IMF in Bissau (Mr. Fonseca) for further transfer to the African Department of
the IMF in Washington, D.C.

Safeguards Assessments:

Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, the BCEAO is subject to a full
safeguards assessment. A new safeguards assessment of the BCEAO was completed on
November 4, 2005. The assessment found that progress has been made in strengthening the
BCEAO’s safeguards framework of the bank since 2002 when the last safeguards assessment
took place.
The BCEAO now publishes a full set of audited financial statements and improvements have
been made to move financial reporting closer to International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS). Furthermore, an internal audit charter has been put in place and mechanisms have been
established to improve risk management and risk prevention and follow-up on internal and
external audit recommendations has been strengthened.
The new assessment identified a number of areas where further steps would help solidify the
progress made. The main recommendations relate to improvements in the external audit process
(including the adoption of a formal rotation policy), further enhancement of the transparency of

APPENDIX II

62

the financial statements by fully adopting IFRS, and further strengthening of the effectiveness of
the internal audit function.

X.

Exchange System and Exchange Rate Arrangement

Guinea-Bissau accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 with
effect from January 1, 1997. It joined the West African Economic and Monetary Union
(WAEMU) in 1997, and the exchange system common to all members of the union is free
from multiple currency practices and exchange restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers for current international transactions. Since January 1, 1999, the CFA franc has
been pegged to the euro at a fixed rate of € l=CFAF 655.95. On May 31, 2005, the rate of the
CFA franc in terms of the SDR was CFAF 784.61=SDR 1.
XI.

Article IV Consultation

Guinea-Bissau is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle. The last Article IV
consultation discussions with Guinea-Bissau were held in Bissau June 19–July 2, 2004. The
staff report (IMF Country Report No. 05/69) was discussed by the Executive Board on
November 19, 2004. A selected issues paper and a statistical annex (IMF Country Report No.
05/94) were also circulated to the Board.

APPENDIX III

Guinea-Bissau: Relations with the World Bank Group
1.
As of April 30, 2006, IDA had approved 29 credits for Guinea-Bissau. Eight credits
had been in the transport and infrastructure sector, three in the energy sector, three for
strengthening the country’s management capability (Technical Assistance (TA)/Economic
Management), two for financing urgently needed imports in support of the government’s
economic recovery program, one in the agricultural sector, three in the health sector, two in
the education sector, one in the social sector, three for structural adjustment, one for
economic rehabilitation and recovery, one for private sector rehabilitation and development,
and one for natural resource management. The total value of these projects is about
US$ 309.9 million equivalent, of which US$293.2 million has been disbursed. As of
March 31, 2006, the undisbursed balance was US$25.8 million.
Structural adjustment credits
2.
IDA has approved a total of US$63.4 million for structural adjustment operations.
These include two structural adjustment credits (SACs), one supplementary SAC, and one
economic rehabilitation and recovery credit (ERRC). The SACs supported the government's
program in the areas of economic liberalization and reform of the public administration and
public enterprise sectors, and the ERRC supports peace building following the political
unrest, promotes the revival of the economy and encourages the pursuit of reforms. Parallel
financing of the SACs came from Switzerland (US$5.3 million equivalent), the Saudi Fund
for Development (US$3.2 million equivalent), the International Fund for Agricultural
Development (US$5.3 million equivalent), the African Development Fund (US$ 23.3 million
equivalent), the Netherlands (US$7.5 million equivalent), the U.S. Agency for International
Development (USAID) (US$4.5 million), and Japan (US$2 million equivalent).
Lending program
3.
For fiscal year (FY) 2005, IDA approved an HIV/AIDS project and a coastal and
biodiversity management project. IDA also proposes to provide budgetary assistance of
US$10 million and support a Multi-Sector Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project (MIRP) of
US$20 million in FY2006. Moreover, the World Bank will to provide US$1.6 million grant
under the Low Income Country Under Stress (LICUS) initiative, and continues to provide
interim assistance to the country as part of the Initiative for the Heavily Indebted Poor
Countries (HIPC). Finally, an interim strategy (ISN) is being prepared and is planned for
approval in FY2007.

66

APPENDIX III

Nonlending program
4.
The Bank prepared a Public Expenditure Review (PER) in 2003 and an Integrated
Poverty and Social Assessment (IPSA) in 2005. A PER update and a Country Integrated
Fiduciary Assessment (CIFA) are planned for FY2006.
International Finance Corporation (IFC)
5.
The IFC’s current portfolio consists of two investments: one in agribusiness
(US$0.25 million), and one in the financial sector (US$0.28 million) to support a commercial
bank (Banco da África). Both have been fully disbursed.

APPENDIX IV

Guinea-Bissau: Statistical Issues
63.
Despite the authorities’ efforts to reestablish their statistical data capabilities, the
quality of data has hampered effective surveillance. Data compilation was severely
impaired during the 1998–99 civil war.
64.
Guinea-Bissau is a participant in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS).
Its GDDS metadata have been posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin
Board since November 2001. However, the metadata and plans for improvement need to
be reviewed as they have not been updated since June 2001 (February 2003 for national
accounts).
65.
The authorities report updates on exchange rates and monetary data in a timely
manner. However, external trade and fiscal sector statistics have not been reported to STA
for publication in the IFS since 1997. Annual national accounts reports have improved,
with current price data being reported up to 2002. However, constant price GDP estimates
remain seriously out of date. An area-wide page for the WAEMU was introduced in the
January 2003 issue of IFS.
National accounts
66.
Inadequate data sources for national accounts statistics remain a major hurdle to
improving the country’s databases. The GDP aggregate is mostly based on crude
assumptions and coefficients derived from the 1986 benchmark-year estimates. The
National Institute of Statistics and Censuses (INEC) was seriously affected by the armed
conflict, and still requires substantial technical assistance to rebuild capacity for compiling
production statistics. Guinea-Bissau is receiving technical assistance in real sector
statistics through West AFRITAC.
Consumer prices
67.
Since July 2002, a harmonized CPI has been compiled, based on the same structure
as in other WAEMU countries. However, the price data are collected only for the capital
Bissau.
Government finance
68.
Between 2000–02, the authorities made substantial progress in preparing timely
reports on monthly and quarterly budget executions. These fiscal data reports were widely
circulated to relevant national institutions; however, they have not been prepared since
early 2003. Moreover, the quarterly reports are no longer submitted for publication in IFS.
The most recent annual data in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSY) are
for 1989.

APPENDIX IV

69.
In March and April 2003, two missions from the Fiscal Affairs Department of the
IMF—one in revenue administration and the other in expenditure management—visited
Guinea-Bissau. A third mission during the same period—in the context of the regional
GDDS project—made recommendations on improving fiscal data. Two experts from West
AFRITAC visited Bissau in February and March 2004, to begin implementation of the
recommendations of the April 2003 mission on revenue administration. The February
mission assisted the authorities to set up of a unit for the monitoring of large enterprises in
the Domestic Tax Department of the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF), and the
March mission provided TA in the area of customs administration.
Monetary and financial statistics
70.
Since Guinea-Bissau’s entry in the WAEMU on May 1, 1997, the BCEAO has
assumed responsibility for compiling and reporting to STA monetary data for GuineaBissau, as is the practice for other member countries in the Union. Guinea-Bissau has
adopted the new accounting and reporting procedures for monetary and financial statistics
in accordance with the BCEAO’s guidelines. Monthly data on monetary statistics for
Guinea Bissau are reported on a regular basis for publication in IFS, albeit with some
delays.
71.
The accuracy of monetary statistics is affected by large cross-border movements of
currency among BCEAO member countries and delays of up to two years in the recording
of such movements. In 2005, the BCEAO made substantial revisions to the estimates of
banknotes in circulation in member states resulting from cross-border banknote movement.
These revisions are due to changes in the method to estimate currency in circulation in the
WAEMU countries. The revised method, based on updated sorting coefficients
(“coefficients de tri”), has been applied retroactively from December 2003.
72.
In March 2006, as part of the authorities’ efforts to implement the MFSM’s
methodology, the BCEAO reported to STA central bank data for June 2005 for all member
countries using the Standardized Report Form (1SR).
Balance of payments statistics
73.
Guinea-Bissau reports trade data to AFR for operational purposes using
information from customs. It also reports balance of payments and international
investment position statistics to STA on an annual basis. Nevertheless, balance of
payments data remain weak, due mostly to substantial unregistered trade and
inconsistencies between data on net foreign assets as reported by the BCEAO and other
economic indicators. In August 2004, an AFRISTAT balance of payments expert visited
Bissau to assess the priority needs for technical assistance and assist the authorities with
the preparation of a work plan for improving compilation of balance of payments and
international investment position statistics. A technical assistance mission is scheduled by
West AFRITAC for the third quarter of calendar 2006.

69

APPENDIX IV

External debt statistics
74.
During the civil war, the computer system processing debt data was severely
damaged, and little progress has been made in rehabilitating it. As a result, debt data have
not been compiled since mid-1998. The basis for the current external debt database is
the 2000 debt sustainability analysis, which the authorities have used to keep track of the
debt situation. However, this is an Excel-based database and a more sophisticated system
is required to improve day-to-day debt management. Moreover, the Debt Division of the
Ministry of Finance faces serious capacity constraints.

APPENDIX V

Guinea-Bissau—External Debt Sustainability Analysis23
Guinea-Bissau is a country in severe debt distress. However, assuming that HIPC completion
point is achieved by the end of 2009, the risk of debt distress is expected to fall to more
moderate levels. Specifically, external debt would be reduced to levels that are sustainable
under the baseline scenario, but the country would still be vulnerable to exchange rate
depreciation, a reduction in the growth rate or a reduction in the grant content of new loans.
The total public debt to GDP ratio remains well above threshold levels even in the baseline
scenario, reflecting the weight of capital contributions to WAEMU.
Introduction
75.
After reaching the decision point of the HIPC initiative in 2000, Guinea-Bissau
failed to maintain macroeconomic stability and progress on the implementation of its poverty
reduction strategy. The PRGF-supported program went off track in 2001, reflecting fiscal
policy slippages associated with military spending, an increase in the wage bill and political
interference in public finance management. The preparation of the full PRSP was delayed as
a result of political instability and capacity constraints. In March 2005, the government
engaged in an SMP, covering April–December 2005, focused on stabilizing the fiscal
situation, including avoiding new domestic arrears, promoting economic growth by
rebuilding infrastructure and removing excessive regulation, and improving governance.
Progress under the SMP was mixed, with the wage bill and domestic arrears exceeding
indicative targets.
76.
In 2006, the government agreed to a new timeline to reengage in programs
supported by the IMF and the World Bank, aiming to reach the completion point under
the HIPC Initiative by end-2009. A new SMP to cover 2006 was discussed with the
authorities in March, to help the authorities establish a track record of policy implementation
and address governance and public expenditure management issues. At end-2006, the
government is also expected to finalize its full PRSP in order to start implementing it
in 2007. Assuming the emergence of a concerted international assistance effort, GuineaBissau would receive support from the IMF under the Emergency Post- Conflict Country
Assistance (EPCA) facility. The EPCA should pave the way for a new PRGF supported
program by end-2008. The World Bank would complete a public expenditure review update
and a fiduciary assessment by mid-2006 and support Guinea-Bissau in FY2007–08 through
an Interim Strategy Note, focusing on infrastructure rehabilitation, reforms in the agricultural
sectors and in economic management. Guinea-Bissau is expected to reach the completion
point in the fourth quarter of 2009.

Prepared under the joint debt sustainability framework for low income countries of the IMF and the World
Bank. This analysis focuses on public external and domestic debt. Data on private external debt are not
available and are therefore excluded from the analysis.

APPENDIX V

Public debt situation as of end-December 2005
77.
At end-2005, Guinea-Bissau’s stock of external public and publicly
guaranteed (PPG) external debt amounted to $1,002 million, of which $327 million in
arrears.24 Multilateral debt amounts to 49 percent of total PPG debt (14 percent is owed to
AfDB/AfDF, 29 percent is owed to IDA, 1.2 percent is owed to IMF) and bilateral and
commercial amounts to 51 percent (Table 1).
The NPV of debt amounts to $745.8 million
or 247.3 percent of GDP and 656.9 percent of
exports. Despite the concessional nature of
most of the PPG external debt, the debt burden
indicators far exceed the policy dependent
debt thresholds for Guinea-Bissau.25

The nominal external debt to GDP
ratio has decreased slightly over the last five
years from 353 percent at end-2000 to
332 percent at end-2005. This positive development, however, is not due to a significant
increase in the current account balance or in FDI, either of which would reduce the financing
needs of the country. Instead, this debt to GDP reduction was due mainly to a strong
appreciation of the CFA franc (pegged to the euro) with respect to the dollar, which
translated into high growth rates of nominal GDP in U.S. dollar terms, despite low real GDP
growth rates.

Nominal public domestic debt amounted to 48 percent of GDP at end-2005.
Nearly 90 percent of this debt corresponds to a required capital contribution to join WAEMU
for a total of CFAF 70 billion to be paid over 25 years starting in 2005. The remaining
domestic debt is composed of obligations to BCEAO linked to statutory advances (no longer
allowed) and to the failure of two banks after the civil war. Domestic arrears are not included
in this debt estimate as an audit will be necessary for a fairly accurate estimation of these
obligations to be possible.
80.
Since the PRGF went off track, Guinea-Bissau has not benefited from most of
the debt relief committed at decision point. At the decision point in 2000, creditors
representing 80 percent of Guinea-Bissau external debt pledged to provide HIPC relief
amounting to $790 million ($417 million in NPV terms). Since 2001, Guinea-Bissau has had
to service a large share of external debt in full. The IMF suspended the provision of interim
24

Bilateral debt data are provided by the authorities, while multilateral debt data are reconciled with creditors.

According to the World Bank Country Policy and Institutions Assessment (CPIA), Guinea Bissau has a poor
quality of policies and institutions. The CPIA rating for 2005 is 2.7, on a scale from 1 to 6, below the
operational cutoff of 3.25 for poor performers.

APPENDIX V

relief and the Paris Club declared null and void any debt rescheduling agreements beyond
end-2001. Many agreements signed with other multilateral and bilateral creditors have not
been implemented because the country failed to remain current on debt service obligations.26
IDA and the African Development Bank (AfDB) Group continued providing interim relief,27
but both multilateral banks will reach the statutory ceiling for the delivery of interim relief at
end-2007 and end-2006 respectively.28 Only China and Cuba cancelled all outstanding
claims.
81.
After the decision point, Guinea-Bissau could not service its external debt and
accumulated arrears to most of its external creditors. Since 2001, the country has not
repaid any creditor that did not provide interim relief, with the exception of the IMF. The
stock of arrears has increased from $139 million before decision point to $327 million at end2005. In the following analysis, arrears are assumed to be cleared through concessional
rescheduling before reaching the completion point. However, the HIPC process would be
delayed if additional arrears arise to multilateral creditors or if Guinea- Bissau could not
agree on a repayment schedule of post-cutoff-date arrears with the Paris Club.
Macroframework
8.
Projections for the evolution of external and total public debt and debt service are
carried out in a baseline scenario and several alternative scenarios: the baseline scenario
assumes that the country stays on track with IMF programs and successfully reengages with
the donor community; a historic scenario assumes key variables at their 10-year historical
average; and different bound test scenarios, simulating temporary shocks to growth, exports,
fiscal revenues, the exchange rate, prices and financial flows.
9.
The macroeconomic assumptions underlying the baseline projection scenario up
to 2009 are described in detail in Box 1. The baseline assumes that an international concerted
assistance effort is in place by end-2006 to help finance urgently needed structural reforms in
the public sector. Post-conflict assistance is assumed to be provided by the Fund by end2006, followed, after two years, by a PRGF. Growth, at 5 percent by 2008, will be sustained
by reforms in the electricity sector and investment in infrastructure which would loosen the
bottleneck for private investment and sustained exports growth. The current account deficit is
26

See IMF Country Report 05/93, November 2004, Box 10, for a comprehensive list of debt rescheduling
agreements reached by Guinea-Bissau with the creditors as part of the provision of HIPC relief.
27

Interim relief from IDA amounted to 100 percent of debt service falling due on debt disbursed before end1999 until October 2003, the expected date of the completion point. Interim relief was decreased to 90 percent
of debt service thereafter. The AfDB extended 100 percent debt service relief to end-2006.

28

IDA could at its discretion extend interim relief to 50 percent of total HIPC relief based on satisfactory
progress toward the completion point triggers and performance under an IMF-supported program. The AfDB
could raise the interim relief ceiling from 40 percent to 50 percent.

74

APPENDIX V

projected initially to deteriorate, but it would be contained by strong export growth and fiscal
consolidation in the medium and long term. The primary fiscal balance is initially expected
to deteriorate as more resources are assigned to public investment and poverty reduction. In
the medium term, however, stronger revenue performance and civil and security service
reforms would contain the public sector wage bill and improve the fiscal balance. Public
external borrowing at concessional terms would be contained over time, while domestic debt
and arrears would be progressively paid down.
10.
HIPC Completion Point is assumed by end-2009. Total HIPC debt relief, as
established at decision point in 2000, amounts to US$ 413 million in NPV terms and would
reduce debt service payments by about 7 percent of GDP per year.

Box 1: Macroeconomic Assumptions Under Baseline Scenario
•
•

•

•
•

•
•

GDP growth rate increases from 3.5 percent in 2005 to 5 percent by 2008, and is
sustained over the following years.
GDP deflator is assumed to grow at a rate slightly below CPI inflation, due to
expected worsening in the terms of trade. After 2009, both GDP deflator and
CPI are assumed to increase at a rate of 2 percent.
The noninterest current account is assumed to deteriorate over the medium term,
reflecting both an increase in foreign-financed investment projects and lower
official transfers in the form of budget support. Over the long run, the
noninterest current account balance as a proportion of GDP converges back to its
2005 level. Exports are assumed to grow at around 8 percent per year until
2010, driven by steady growth in cashew nut production at least in the mediumterm; export growth rate is assumed to decrease to about 6 percent thereafter.
Foreign direct investment as a ratio of GDP ratio is assumed to remain constant
in the medium and long term at the level observed in 2005 (1.3 percent).
New borrowing will be contracted at highly concessional terms, with the grant
element in new disbursements assumed to remain slightly above the 50 percent
that was agreed on under the 2006 SMP.
The primary fiscal deficit is assumed to decrease from 4.5 percent of GDP in
2006 to 1.7 percent by 2010, maintaining this level from then on.
Total external loan financing is assumed to be 5 percent of GDP per year on
average over the next 20 years.

APPENDIX V

Debt sustainability
11.
The sustainability of the current external and total public debt is judged based on
various indicative debt and debt service thresholds established for countries with poorly
performing economic policies and institutions, and shown in Table 1.

All debt indicators assume the full delivery of HIPC relief at end-2009 and refer to the NPV of public and

2/
Threshold over which countries with similar evaluations of policies and institutions would have at least a
25 percent chance of having a prolonged incident of debt distress in the coming year. Guinea-Bissau lies within
the bottom quintile of countries ranked by the World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment Index
(CPIA).

12.
The simulations presented in Tables 2a, 2b, 3a, 3b and Figures 1 and 2, point to a
country currently in severe debt distress, with arrears accruing to multilateral creditors, Paris
Club creditors and other official and commercial creditors. Such arrears are projected to be
settled by 2009 only if the HIPC process remains on track. Assuming HIPC relief, indicators
based on debt and debt service ratios in simulated scenarios point to mixed signals of the risk
of debt distress. The NPV of external debt-to-GDP ratio remains above the 30 percent
threshold during most of the simulation period in the baseline scenario as well as under the
stress test scenarios. In the case of total public debt, the debt to GDP ratio remains well
above the threshold levels for the whole period and the ratio to government revenues
surpasses the threshold for a significant period, reflecting the weight of capital contribution
commitments to WAEMU on top of the external debt burden. On the other hand, the debt
service ratios to exports and government revenues quickly fall below threshold levels in the
baseline scenario immediately after the HIPC completion point is reached.
13.
Alternative scenarios and stress tests indicate that significant exchange rate
depreciation, reductions in GDP growth, and a lower grant element of new loans would
substantially increase the risk of debt distress. The most severe scenario is that created by the
effects of large (30 percent) exchange rate devaluation, which would cause the NPV of
external debt to GDP ratio to significantly exceed the 30 percent threshold during the whole
projection period.

76

APPENDIX V

14.
These simulations do not include the additional debt relief that could be obtained
from the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), which would amount, at completion
point, to US$77.3 million in net present value, or 21 percent of GDP. In this case, the
external debt service to exports ratio would be reduced by an additional 3 percentage points.
Staffs appraisal
15.
Since Guinea-Bissau is running arrears, it is automatically rated as in debt distress.
Guinea-Bissau’s risk of debt distress would be reduced substantially if the HIPC completion
point were achieved by end-2009, as hoped for under current arrangements. Continued
political stability, sustained adjustment, and reform, and a concerted international assistance
effort are key elements for the country to achieve completion point and the associated debt
reduction to sustainable levels. Even within this scenario, the country’s capacity to sustain
reasonable debt burden ratios may be compromised by significant shocks to the nominal
exchange rate, the growth rate, or the concessionality of new borrowing.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that NPV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments devided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
August 17, 2006

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation with
Guinea-Bissau
On July 31, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Guinea-Bissau.1
Background
A devastating armed civil conflict during 1998-99 and the ensuing prolonged political instability
and governance deficiencies took a heavy toll on Guinea-Bissau’s economy. The physical
infrastructure was destroyed, the economy stagnated, government administrative capacity
virtually collapsed, social conditions worsened and poverty increased. For most of the postconflict period, economic activity remained sluggish with real per capita GDP declining by an
annual average of 2 percent until 2005. The fiscal situation deteriorated sharply and external
assistance dwindled, leading to mounting wages arrears and unsustainable external debt
position.
Since mid-2004, Guinea-Bissau has made important strides in overcoming the effects of this
protracted period of instability that ended in mid-2003 with a coup. Parliamentary elections were
held in March 2004 and Presidential elections in July 2005. The process of rebuilding the
administration and addressing the country’s economic problems has begun in earnest. Efforts
have also been made to improve budget preparation and tax administration, which has allowed
for a significant increase in tax revenues.
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by
the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman
of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to
the country's authorities.
1

2
Economic activity in 2005 was stronger than expected. Real GDP growth is estimated to have
rebounded from an average of 0.5 percent for 2003–04 to 3.5 percent in 2005, driven by good
agricultural performance and despite sluggish activity in other sectors. Average consumer price
inflation rose to 3.4 percent from 0.8 percent in 2004 as a result of higher import prices of oil
and rice. Notwithstanding the strong growth in exports, the external current account worsened
in 2005 because of a large increase in imports and a drop in official transfers and private
remittances. The fiscal balance improved, but cash flow problems persisted throughout the
year. The fiscal deficit (including grants) was lower than budgeted at 12 percent of GDP,
compared to 15 percent in 2004, but new domestic arrears accumulated.
Formal financial intermediation was very limited during 2005 even by regional standards,
with total deposits amounting to only 8 percent of GDP. Although the only local bank has been
increasing its financing of the cashew harvest, average outstanding claims to the private sector
during 2005 did not exceed 2.2 percent of GDP; average credit to the government amounted to
1.3 percent of GDP. As elsewhere in the region, the bank is very liquid. The lack of profitable
projects has left it with excess reserves that can be used to meet the seasonal needs of the
private sector and the government.
Guinea-Bissau’s external debt remains unsustainable and can only be resolved through the
HIPC Initiative. After most interim debt relief was suspended, external debt service obligations,
except those to multilateral creditors, fell into arrears. Total external public debt including
arrears amounted to 332 percent of GDP in 2005; scheduled annual external debt service was
about 16.4 percent of GDP.
For 2006, real GDP growth is projected at 4.2 percent and CPI inflation at about 2 percent,
barring any major supply shocks. The balance of payments deficit is projected to reach
15.4 percent of GDP, which would be financed by donor support, accumulation of arrears,
and debt relief. The fiscal program aims at achieving a domestic primary deficit of 3.7 percent of
GDP that would avoid the accumulation of domestic arrears. The achievement of this fiscal
objective would require progress in keeping current spending in check and intensifying revenue
mobilization, but cash flow difficulties could arise if external budget support is delayed.
Progress on structural reform over the past year has been slow, reflecting serious technical
capacity constraints and delays in obtaining technical assistance, and the changes in
government. The structural reform process is being given a new momentum with an action plan
for implementing the long-overdue civil service reform, the security sector reform, private sector
development initiatives, and measures to rehabilitate roads, electricity, and water infrastructure.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that Guinea-Bissau has made major strides in overcoming the effects
of a long period of political upheaval and were encouraged by the positive turn of economic and
financial developments, amid signs of a return to political stability. Directors commended in
particular the progress made in rebuilding the administration and restoring fiscal control.
Directors concurred that the main challenges now are to consolidate peace and political stability

3
and to lay the foundation for sustainable high growth and significant poverty reduction. This will
require Guinea-Bissau to achieve fiscal and debt sustainability and to deepen structural
reforms.
Directors noted the favorable macroeconomic outlook and underscored that the strength and
timing of the economic recovery would hinge critically on political stability, disciplined fiscal
policy, an acceleration of structural reform to promote private sector developments, and the
resumption of external financial assistance.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ policy framework that was supported by a new staffmonitored program (SMP). They noted that with steadfast commitment to its policy objectives,
Guinea-Bissau’s prospects for economic recovery and the resumption of external financing
appear promising. Directors emphasized that the new SMP would enable Guinea-Bissau to
move to emergency post-conflict assistance as soon as concerted international assistance is in
place. They advised the authorities to use this opportunity to articulate a medium-term strategy
that would aim at achieving fiscal and debt sustainability and bringing about substantive
progress toward the MDGs.
Directors observed that the fiscal program for 2006 makes progress in moving Guinea-Bissau
toward fiscal sustainability. Nonetheless, they noted that determined efforts will be needed to
strengthen revenue mobilization and to keep current spending in check. To this end, they
emphasized the need to widen the tax base, reduce exemptions, effectively monitor spending
from the commitment stage, and strictly adhere to a monthly cash flow plan consistent with
spending priorities. They also noted with concern the continued slippages in the wage bill,
which had contributed to the accumulation of domestic arrears in 2005.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ launch of a long-overdue civil service reform aimed at
achieving a durable reduction in the excessive wage bill. They nevertheless emphasized that
the authorities should put in place a donor-supported program to support the integration of
retrenched workers into the private sector, so as to maintain social stability. Directors also noted
that careful implementation of the planned security sector reform, with the assistance of
development partners, should also remove a major constraint on Guinea-Bissau’s development
agenda.
Directors agreed that membership in the WAEMU has served Guinea-Bissau well, particularly
by keeping inflation low. They judged the current level of the real effective exchange rate to be
broadly appropriate, but underscored that Guinea-Bissau’s external competitiveness would
need to be enhanced through further progress on the structural reform agenda. Directors
encouraged the authorities to accelerate the implementation of measures to rehabilitate the
electricity company, roads and other infrastructure, and to enhance the investment climate.
Directors cautioned that these reforms need to be prioritized and managed carefully to ensure
that limited technical capacity is not overstretched.

4
Directors urged the authorities to put in place a strategy to address domestic and external
arrears through judicious use of fiscal resources, debt relief, and donor assistance. They
advised the authorities to launch a complete audit of domestic arrears and seek external
resources to help clear these arrears. Regarding the external debt service arrears, Directors
called on the authorities to continue servicing multilateral debt to preserve their eligibility for the
Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative once they reach the HIPC completion point, and to embark
promptly on discussions with creditors to resolve the external debt problem.
Directors noted the severe debt distress of Guinea-Bissau and underscored that the
mobilization of external assistance will be key to the success of the authorities’ reform efforts
and the achievement of external sustainability. Although debt distress is expected to fall to
moderate levels if the HIPC completion point is reached, Directors stressed that new assistance
should be provided on highly concessional terms, preferably in the form of grants, to reduce the
debt burden.
Directors welcomed the progress made in the preparation of the PRSP through a broad-based
consultation process. They called on the authorities to strengthen Guinea-Bissau’s statistical
system to increase transparency and to allow effective surveillance and monitoring of progress
toward the Millennium Development Goals.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations

Statement by Damian Ondo Mañe, Executive Director on Guinea-Bissau
July 31, 2006

On behalf of my Guinea-Bissau’s authorities, I would like to thank staff for the candid and
helpful discussions held during the recent Article IV consultations and Fund management for
its continuous support. The comprehensive staff report and the Selected Issues paper offer a
useful guidance to my authorities for advancing economic and structural reforms. My
authorities are also grateful for the support received from development partners, including
the Fund to help stabilize the political and macroeconomic environment. They also
appreciate that agreement was reached with staff to monitor their program for another year.
Since our last Board discussion on Guinea-Bissau in November 2004, significant political
and social progress has taken place, including the improvement of the country’s political
stability and security, following the parliamentary and presidential elections held in 2004 and
2005; the finalization of the demobilization, reinsertion and reintegration operations in 2005,
which led to the reintegration of approximately 3,000 ex-combatants; and the appointment of
a new government in December 2005. My authorities are appreciative of the international
mediation from the regional institutions (ECOWAS, WAEMU, and WADB) in February
2006, which led to the agreement among all political parties.
With the improvement in security, my authorities were able to organize the sixth Summit of
the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries (CPLP) in Bissau in mid-July 2006 aimed
at consolidating the ties that link these countries in the areas of cooperation, coordination, the
international arena and raising the community’s profile. The meeting welcomed the
stabilization of political situation in Guinea-Bissau. Heads of State agreed on the need for a
regular follow-up of the member states’ internal situation, aimed at identifying constraints
and reinforcing CPLP capacity to settle conflicts, marshal humanitarian aid and consolidate
institutions. To consolidate the peace process, which is an essential pillar for the new
government to implement its comprehensive economic program and to reduce poverty in
Guinea-Bissau, my authorities are fully committed to maintain a constructive dialogue with
all the national actors, including business and trade unions, as well as civil society partners.
The implementation of the 2005 SMP, covering the period of April-December 2005, focused
on stabilizing the fiscal situation, including avoiding new domestic arrears, promoting
economic growth and improving governance. Despite difficulties with regard to structural
reforms, due to technical and institutional capacity constraints, delays in obtaining external
financial assistance and change in government, the implementation of this program helped
the authorities to make progress in stabilizing the macroeconomic environment. In order to
consolidate the progress achieved in the 2005 SMP and stabilize the macroeconomic
environment, my authorities are implementing a new SMP, covering the period of
April-December 2006. They are committed to pursue further the adjustment process and

2
the building of institutional capacity, in order to establish a strong track record of program
implementation, which they expect will pave the way for Fund support under the Emergency
Post-Conflict Assistance (EPCA). The SMP should also enable Guinea-Bissau to build a
track record for consideration of a new PRGF-supported program and eventual debt relief.
However, the tasks ahead represent a daunting challenge that Guinea-Bissau cannot meet
without a timely and adequate support from the international community in terms of
technical and financial assistance.
Recent Economic and Financial Developments
Guinea-Bissau’s macroeconomic performance in 2005 was strong, driven by favorable
developments in agriculture. Real GDP is estimated to have grown by 3.5 percent in 2005,
due to a good performance of cashew nut and grains harvest. However, activity in other
sectors, such as industry and tourism, remained weak, owing to lack of basic facilities.
Moreover, for the first time since 2001, GDP per capita recorded a slight increase. As a result
of good cereal production, the 12-month inflation declined to 1 percent by December 2005.
In the fiscal area, the performance was robust in 2005, as a result of stronger-thanprogrammed tax revenues and lower non-wage expenditures. Moreover, the domestic
primary fiscal balance on a commitment basis also improved. However, cash flows problems
persisted, due in part to shortfalls in external assistance. On the revenue side, tax revenue
increased significantly, as customs revenue collections benefited from the large increase of
imports and the improvement in customs administration through the verification of imports
shipped by land at the destination instead of border and the required prepayment of export
taxes before shipment. Furthermore, tax administration was reinforced with the creation of a
Large-Taxpayers Unit and the simplification of tax regime.
On the expenditure side, efforts were made to improve budget preparation through
centralizing the authorization for expenditure commitments in the Ministry of Finance and
closing all government bank accounts outside the central bank (BCEAO). A Treasury
Committee was appointed to reconcile accounts between the Budget Department, the
Treasury, and the BCEAO, in order to maintain a better fiscal control.
Although the country’s financial system is thin, the recent opening of two regional banks
in December 2005 and early 2006 augurs well for ensuring a return of confidence in
Guinea-Bissau. As elsewhere in the region, the banking system is very liquid. Efforts
are underway to encourage financial intermediation.
As regards the external sector, Guinea-Bissau achieved important earnings from cashew, the
main export crop, stemming from a substantial rise in world prices and further expansion in
production. However, export revenue did not compensate for the large increase in import and
a drop in private remittances, such that the external current account deficit widened. With

3
regard to the debt issue, Guinea-Bissau’s external debt remains a heavy burden on the
country’s limited finances. Despite their scarce resources, my authorities are committed to
normalize relations with all external creditors. It is in this perspective that they will continue
to make efforts to remain current on the payment of external debt service to multilateral
creditors, so as to preserve the eligibility to debt relief.
Performance under the 2005 SMP
Under the last SMP, the authorities took encouraging steps to stabilize the macroeconomic
situation, and progress was made in implementing structural measures. In particular, on the
fiscal front, the targets for revenue, domestic financing and the domestic primary budget
deficit were observed. However, the indicative targets for the wage bill for the year as a
whole were not met and domestic arrears level was surpassed, due to some adverse factors
beyond the authorities’ control. Also, faced with delays in budget support from the World
Bank and the EU, the government contracted commercial debt, which allowed to clear part of
domestic arrears in 2005.
On the structural front, 6 out of the 10 structural benchmarks were met. Among these are: the
establishment of a Large-Taxpayers Unit within the Ministry of Finance; the transfer of the
collection of customs duties and taxes to the office of Customs in the port of Bissau; the
completion of discussions with all ministries and other budgetary units on the budget for
2006; the rehabilitation of the taxpayer master file; the reconciliation of changes in the
treasury accounts at the BCEAO with expenditure authorized by the Treasury Committee;
and the collection of full amount due on imports of petroleum products and rice and cashew
nut exports. The indicative targets missed or partially met were related to the implementation
of banderole system for alcoholic beverage and cigarettes; the approval by the Council of
Ministers of the Organic law of the Ministry of Economy and finance; the implementation of
the new organizational chart of the Customs Department and the implementation of censuses
of the military and paramilitary. In their reform efforts, my authorities will take the necessary
steps to meet these targets.
On governance and transparency, the Ministry of Finance has started in July 2005 to publish
on a monthly basis, a summary table on fiscal developments. Promoting good governance
will remain a cornerstone of government policies.
Macroeconomic and Structural Policies for 2006
The authorities are aware of the need to consolidate the peace process and political stability,
which are necessary to maintain macroeconomic stability and implement deeper structural
reforms. The program for 2006 is part of a broader medium-term’s government program for
2006-09, in line with the draft Poverty Reduction Strategy. Policies for 2006 aim at
improving the country’s fiscal position, through better tax and public expenditure

4
management. The program also puts forward macroeconomic policies and structural reforms
that will be key for improving the investment climate, reducing poverty in Guinea-Bissau and
making progress towards the MDGs. The macroeconomic framework underlying the 2006
SMP lies on the achievement of real GDP growth of 4.2 percent, higher than the population
growth rate; and an average annual inflation rate close to 2 percent, in line with the WAEMU
convergence criterion.
Fiscal Policy and Reforms in 2006
Prudent fiscal policies will be pursued. On the revenue side, the authorities are committed to
boost revenues through better enforcement of fishing rights fees, payments of licenses by cell
phone operations and continued improvement of customs administration controls. Measures
will also be considered to move faster with the planned reforms to simplify the tax system,
widen the tax base, and combat tax evasion. The process of simplifying the tax system started
with the elimination of several low-yielding taxes in the budget for 2005. Corporate income
tax rates were already unified and a minimum tax was introduced for companies that are
unable to provide a balance sheet. The authorities intend also to strengthen corporate taxes by
asking cashew nut exporters to pay their taxes in advance. Moreover, custom exemptions,
which represent nearly 40 percent of total custom revenue, will be reduced by putting an end
to discretionary exemptions.
On the expenditure side, given the importance that the authorities attach to poverty reduction
in their policy agenda, they are determined to reining in discretionary spending to free
resources needed to meet the social needs in the areas of health and education and to improve
basic infrastructure. My authorities hope that the implementation of the first phase of the
civil service reform and the reform of the security sector will help to contain the wage bill.
The authorities intend to further strengthen the public expenditure management and prevent
the accumulation of domestic payments arrears. In this regard, they will make use of the
framework of a day-to-day fiscal management on the basis of a strict cash management
system. The Treasury Committee, in which the UNDP and the EU were allowed to
participate as observers, will be in charge of implementing the cash flow plan. To ensure a
strict control of the budget, the Ministry of Finance will prepare on a regular basis a report
comparing the budget and actual expenditure by main budget category. The authorities are
also determined to further strengthen budgetary control procedures and increase transparency
and donor confidence.
Monetary Policy and Financial Sector Reform
Monetary policy will continue to be conducted at the regional level by the BCEAO, which
aims to maintain price stability and strengthen the external position. Although Guinea-Bissau
is estimated to have missed convergence indicators established under the WAEMU’s Pact of
Convergence, Stability, Growth and Solidarity, the authorities remain committed to this pact.

5
On the financial sector, efforts will be pursued to strengthen the system. Guinea-Bissau had
recourse to the regional market for short-term government paper for the first time in October
2005, as the Treasury issued a six-month treasury bill that was mostly subscribed by banks
outside Guinea-Bissau. Over the medium-term, my authorities are planning to issue treasury
bills for liquidity purposes and thus, help to support financial market development in the
region.
Structural Reforms
My authorities are aware of the key problems facing the country. They are committed to
address structural weaknesses in key sectors of the economy, with the view of improving
efficiency, revitalizing the private sector and limiting potential cost on future budgets. They
are also committed to reforming the public administration, undertaking actions concerning
privatization and energy reform, and promoting good governance. My authorities share the
view that the successful implementation of the reform agenda over the medium-term would
require considerable technical assistance. In their efforts to improve the investment climate,
Guinea-Bissau has recently joined the MIGA.
Debt Issue
Guinea-Bissau has an unsustainable external debt position. It is the intention of the
authorities to maintain a close dialogue with the Fund to implement the needed policies, and
work closely with creditors, so that the country can receive support under the PRGF, and also
move to the completion point under the HIPC Initiative. In the meantime, the authorities will
make every effort to remain current on debt service to multilateral creditors.
Poverty Reduction Strategy
The authorities are cognizant of the need to improve social indicators and make progress
towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Work on the preparation of a final
PRSP is underway, with the participation of all stakeholders, including the civil society. The
assistance from donors will remain crucial to help the country implement policies envisaged
in the document.
Conclusion
My authorities have made significant efforts to restore peace and political stability since the
country emerged from a prolonged conflict situation. Support from their development
partners, including the Fund, has been critical in this process. Under the 2005 SMP, as a
result of improved political situation, the country was able to stabilize its macroeconomic
environment and to make some headway on the structural front. Under the 2006 SMP, it is
my authorities’ intention to pursue their adjustment efforts to consolidate the progress

achieved so far. They remain firmly committed to the adjustment process, which they view as
critical to achieving the medium-term fiscal and debt sustainability and addressing the
poverty situation facing Guinea-Bissau. The progress achieved up to date is encouraging and
reflects the authorities’ firm commitment to restore financial discipline. However, the
authorites’ efforts need to be complemented by a strong support from the international
community. I, therefore, call on donors to provide Guinea-Bissau with timely and adequate
technical and financial assistance, so that the country can make steady progress towards
more robust and sustained growth, poverty alleviation, and the achievement of the MDGs.
