STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
June 13, 2012

KEY ISSUES
Context. Saudi Arabia is the world’s largest oil exporter and has employed its spare
capacity to help stabilize the global oil market, providing important support to the
global economy. The associated increase in oil revenues has resulted in sharply higher
fiscal and current account surpluses and provided room to accelerate initiatives to
address pressing social issues, including a shortage of affordable housing and
unemployment. Spillovers from higher growth and fiscal spending, together with
increased financial assistance, have positively impacted the region.
Outlook and risks. Economic prospects are strong. Growth is expected to remain
high—led by the private sector—with large fiscal and external surpluses due to
increased prices and production of oil. The oil market remains the main source of risk,
with the economy showing little direct impact from the euro area crisis and few signs
of overheating.
Fiscal policy. The expansionary fiscal stance is appropriate, but the level and
composition of expenditures needs to be carefully controlled to ensure that
expenditures can be contained over the medium-term.
Macroeconomic policy framework. Strong fiscal institutions and macroprudential
tools can help ensure economic stability in the face of increased oil price volatility.
While the exchange rate peg remains appropriate, there are increased policy tensions
due to diverging conditions in the U.S. economy and the global oil market.
Growth and employment creation. Labor market initiatives to create more
employment opportunities for Saudi nationals need to go hand in hand with ongoing
initiatives to ensure an adequate supply of Saudi nationals equipped to take up
positions created. Improving productivity will be key to sustaining the current growth
momentum.

CONTEXT: ADVANCING NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
OBJECTIVES WHILE RESPONDING TO ELEVATED
GLOBAL AND REGIONAL UNCERTAINTIES
1.
Saudi Arabia has provided important support to the global economy during a period
of high uncertainty, including through its actions in stabilizing the global oil market. Global
risks—both from the ongoing euro area crisis and broader geopolitical tensions—have created
substantial uncertainty with respect to the global growth outlook. Reflecting its systemic role in the
global oil market—not only as the world’s largest oil exporter but also the only country with
significant spare capacity—Saudi Arabia has, in line with its longstanding commitment, increased its
oil production to ease upward pressures on global oil prices. The commitment to provide $15 billion
in additional resources for the IMF has also contributed to global stability by increasing the funding
available for all countries encountering financing needs.
2.
High oil revenues have been
used to accelerate progress on
domestic developmental objectives,
as well as to support other
economies in the region. New
initiatives were announced in 2011 to
accelerate progress in addressing
pressing social issues, including
employment, the availability of
affordable housing, and SME financing.
Regional support has come both in the
form of substantial new pledges of
financial assistance and indirectly, as
fiscal expansion in Saudi Arabia creates
increased demand for imports and also
raises remittances from foreign labor
employed in the Kingdom.

A key challenge is to ensure that the opportunity provided by the spike in oil revenues
is used efficiently to enhance social outcomes and improve the productivity of the economy.
In the late 1970s—with oil prices at similar levels in real terms—surging oil revenues were channeled
into a multifaceted effort to transform the nation into a diversified and modern economy. But this
effort was impacted by the sharp and sustained dip in oil prices beginning in the early 1980s that
left the economy with a debt to GDP-ratio above 100 percent by the end of the 1990s. Public
investments over the past several decades have contributed to strong improvements in social

outcomes, such as in education. While the contribution of private sector to GDP is expected to
exceed 48 percent, the economy remains largely dependent on hydrocarbons and non-oil growth
driven by factor accumulation, with a minor role for productivity growth. Policy buffers are higher
than in the late 1970’s, but going forward it is important to ensure that on-going policy initiatives
are carefully designed and implemented.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
4.
The economic impact of regional unrest and the protracted euro area crisis has been
offset by sharply higher oil revenues. Saudi Arabia helped stabilize the global oil market and
contain the increase in the price of oil by increasing its oil production in mid-2011 to offset supply
shortfalls from Libya, and again in early 2012 in response to increased supply uncertainties
stemming from elevated geopolitical tensions. Oil revenues increased sharply, resulting in
substantial fiscal and external surpluses despite large new domestic fiscal spending initiatives.
International reserves, which constitute the principal savings component of oil wealth, surpassed half
a trillion dollars (94 percent of 2011 GDP).
5.
With increased fiscal space, government spending accelerated in 2011 and the non-oil
economy expanded at the highest rate in three decades. New initiatives to address pressing
social issues translated into real government spending growth of 20 percent. The expansionary fiscal
stance along with accommodative monetary policy and stronger non-oil exports, supported
8 percent growth in the non-oil economy—the highest since 1981—with the construction and
manufacturing sectors providing the largest lifts. Quarterly real GDP data show non-oil private
sector growth accelerating through the year, reaching about 10 percent (y-o-y) in the fourth quarter.
The latest PMI and point of sale transaction data point to continued rapid growth in the first four
months of 2012.
6.
Despite the strong economic expansion, headline inflation stabilized in 2011 as
international food inflation subsided, but core inflation rose. Headline inflation (y-o-y) fell in the
first half of 2011 but began to rise in the third quarter and ended the year at 5.3 percent. While food
inflation declined throughout the year, rent inflation together with other components (home
furniture and services) started to gain momentum in the second half, pushing annual core inflation
up to 5 percent for 2011. Data for the first quarter of 2012, however, indicate a slight reversal with
food inflation picking up and core inflation falling.
7.
SAMA left policy rates unchanged in 2011. Consistent with the commitment to the
exchange rate peg and reflecting the monetary policy stance in the U.S., SAMA has not adjusted its
interest rate corridor since 2009, keeping the repo and reverse repo rates constant at 2 and
0.25 percent, respectively. Fiscal spending contributed to strong growth in the monetary base of
22 percent (up from 10 percent in 2010). SAMA absorbed some of the excess liquidity through the
issuance of central bank bills and its reverse repo facility, limiting broad money growth to 13 percent
and smoothing credit dynamics throughout the year.

The banking sector remains highly capitalized and liquid, with improved profitability.
Bank profits increased by 18 percent in 2011 as the return on assets rose and bank leverage
increased. Credit to the private sector grew by 11 percent (compared to 5 percent in 2010) with
consumer loans and credit to the manufacturing sector constituting the main contributors. The
banking system remained well capitalized and highly liquid at end-2011, with a Capital Adequacy
Ratio (CAR) of 17.4 percent and with excess funds at SAMA amounting to over 20 percent of the

9.
Structural reforms gained new momentum in 2011. New initiatives approved in February
and March, 2011 seek to accelerate progress in addressing pressing social issues, including
improvements in access to affordable housing, employment, and SME financing.


Housing finance. Almost two thirds of a combined $110 billion fiscal package was allocated to a
multi-year project to construct half a million new affordable housing units. An additional
$11 billion were allocated to the Real Estate Development Fund (REDF)—to increase the
availability of housing loans.



Employment. A new jobseekers’ allowance (Hafiz) and a new Saudization program (Nitaqat) to
increase the employment of nationals in the private sector came into effect in late 2011. These
programs have been supported by expanded job placement and training schemes.



SME financing. About $5 billion were allocated to the government-operated Saudi Credit and
Savings Bank, with the intention of expanding SME financing. A similar amount is due to be
transferred to the Saudi Industrial Development Fund to support bank credit to SMEs (Kafala)
and other lending.

OUTLOOK
The macroeconomic outlook remains very strong, but subject to an unusually large degree of
uncertainty. Elevated geopolitical risks have generated higher oil prices that along with higher oil
production imply continued large fiscal and external surpluses. But a weaker oil price scenario could
materialize, for example if the pressures in the euro area lead to weaker global demand. The projected
trend decline in oil prices over the medium-term will reduce the surpluses, with the fiscal balance
expected to turn into a small deficit by 2017.
10.
Elevated geopolitical risks and associated oil price volatility have increased the
expected volatility of external and fiscal balances. In response to heightened oil market
uncertainty in early 2012, Saudi Arabia increased oil production (including condensates) to 10 mbd,
a 30 year high, consistent with its commitment to stabilize the global oil market.1 Combining this
output uncertainty with the price uncertainty imbedded in oil derivatives contracts (using a band of
one standard deviation on the oil price), uncertainty with respect to the evolution of fiscal and
external balances is substantial (see Figure 2).


Current account: Under the baseline scenario, the current account balance is projected at
26.5 percent of GDP in 2012, but would decline throughout the medium term, reaching

1

The baseline scenario assumes Saudi oil production (including condensates) of 10.1 mbd in 2012 (compared to
9.6 mbd in 2011 and approximately the same production volume as in Q1 2012). The 9.5 to 10.5 range reflects on the
upper end potential global supply disturbances and on the lower end a slowdown in global demand if the euro area
crisis intensifies.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

12 percent of GDP by 2017.2 However, the risk profile suggests that the current account
outcome by 2015 may range from a deficit of 3 percent of GDP to a 27 percent surplus.
Fiscal balance: Overall spending growth is projected to moderate somewhat to about 7 percent
per annum over the medium term. Under the baseline scenario, the fiscal surplus is expected to
narrow gradually, before turning into deficit in 2017. The risk profile suggests a wide range for
the fiscal balance, from a 15 percent of GDP surplus to a 12 percent of GDP deficit by 2015.

Errors and omissions in the balance of payments during 2005–11 range between -4.1 percent of GDP and

the magnitude of the errors and omissions suggests some uncertainty on the measurement of the current account
surplus.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Discussions focused on four main areas: (i) the macroeconomic policy stance and key risks; (ii) the
macroeconomic policy framework and supporting institutions and policy tools; (iii) growth and job
creation; and (iv) financial sector development.

A. The Macroeconomic Policy Stance and Key Risks
11.
There was broad agreement on the baseline forecasts for continued strong growth and
modest inflation. Non-oil activity is expected to slow down in the second half of 2012, reaching
6.5 percent by the end of the year. Inflation is projected to remain broadly stable, increasing slightly
in the first half of 2012—consistent with the projected strong non-oil growth in the first quarter—
and ending the year at around 5 percent.

The VAR model consists of three endogenous variables (credit, CPI and non-oil GDP) and five exogenous variables
(nominal government spending, NEER, international food prices, average oil price and 3-month LIBOR). The quarterly
non-oil GDP series is interpolated using quarterly sales transaction data.

12.
There are few signs that the economy is overheating. The authorities noted that inflation
remains driven primarily by food prices (largely externally determined given the weight of imports)
and rents (determined by structural factors). Housing pressures were being addressed through the
initiatives to expand housing supply and improve access to financing, while the open capital and
labor markets as well as investments in infrastructure served to reduce the incidence of structural
bottlenecks often seen in fast growing economies.
13.
Nevertheless, inflation risks are tilted to the upside, given elevated fiscal spending,
accelerating credit growth, and an accommodative monetary policy consistent with the peg to the
U.S. dollar. In the event that inflation risks materialize, it was agreed that a coordinated policy
response by the fiscal authorities and SAMA would be needed. Containing inflationary pressures
would require a combination of slowing the pace of fiscal spending and use of SAMA’s policy
tools—the authorities noted that, in the past, reserve requirements and loan to deposit ratios had
proven effective.

While the expansionary fiscal stance is appropriate in the near-term, staff stressed that
it should be contained over the medium-term to a level consistent with inter-generational
equity in the consumption of oil wealth and to reduce vulnerabilities to oil prices. Recent fiscal

oil prices has increased and that the
medium term non-oil primary deficit is above the level consistent with intergenerational equity by
about 10 percent of non-oil GDP. Taking into account oil price uncertainty implied by oil derivatives
contracts, the non-oil primary deficit is close to the upper bound of the sustainability range.
15.
Staff recommended putting in place plans to ensure a clear downward trend in the
non-oil deficit ratio to non-oil GDP. Focusing spending on well-defined capital projects and
curtailing increases in current spending would support economic growth and allow for a reduction
in spending once the current phase of investment is completed. In addition, moving ahead with the
GCC-wide VAT and reforming domestic pricing of energy products would help broaden the tax base
and reduce dependence on volatile oil export revenues.
16.
The authorities considered the staff’s spending projections to be on the high side, and
noted that there was room to contain fiscal balances going forward, if needed. Key
components were:


Composition of expenditures. The authorities stressed that recent expenditure increases had
emphasized capital projects, including both housing and various infrastructure projects. Current
spending increases included important new social initiatives such as the jobseekers’ allowance
(Hafiz) that represented both an important extension of the social safety net and a step in
assisting Saudis to enter the labor force. Permanent entitlement increases, however, remained
limited.



Revenues: Recently approved legislation had provided a comprehensive legal framework for the
administration of non-oil revenues. The authorities noted that the introduction of a GCC-wide
VAT was still being studied, but that other options—such as adjusting excises to discourage
consumption of certain products (e.g. tobacco)—were also under discussion.

Box 1. Spillovers from Saudi Arabia
Global spillovers from Saudi Arabia largely relate to its role in stabilizing the global oil market. Saudi Arabia’s
non-oil economy represents less than 0.5 percent of world GDP and the impact of Saudi non-oil activity on
the global economy is therefore fairly modest. Reflecting trade linkages and the high import content of
Saudi consumption, emerging Asia would see some of the largest spillovers even as a 10 percent of GDP
fiscal expansion in Saudi Arabia is estimated to increase this region’s GDP by less than 0.1 percent—see
Chapter VI of MCD DP 11/01 “Enhancing Economic Outcomes in an Uncertain Global Economy” by BeidasStrom, Rasmussen, and Robinson (2011).
From a regional perspective, however, there are sizable positive spillover effects from non-oil activity in
Saudi Arabia. Relative to the size of their own economies, linkages to Saudi Arabia’s economy are strongest
in its immediate neighbors, with the main channels including trade, remittances, FDI, external assistance, and
financial markets. Using a GVAR model developed by Cashin, Mohaddes, and Raissi (2012), a one percent
increase in Saudi non-oil GDP is estimated to increase GDP in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, and in other GCC
countries by between 0.2 and 0.4 percent (see SIP, Chapter IV).
Regional Spillovers from a one percent Increase in Saudi Non-Oil GDP

Among the different channels, spillovers via non-oil goods trade would be especially important for Egypt,
Ethiopia, and Jordan (the three countries where exports to Saudi Arabia comprise the largest share of total
exports). Linkages to other GCC countries include services trade and financial markets, while spillovers via
remittances would be especially

The key risk facing the economy is the oil market. A large and sustained dip in oil
prices—as occurred in the 1980’s and 90’s—would present significant challenges to the economy.
The authorities stressed that given the policy buffers that have been built up in recent years, Saudi
Arabia is in a position to sustain expenditures at levels consistent with medium-term objectives for
some time. In addition, they stressed that the economy is more resilient now—due to a greater
degree of economic diversification, more developed financial markets, and better public
infrastructure. Stress tests, undertaken during the 2011 FSAP Update, had also indicated that the
banking system could absorb a large decline in oil prices.
18.
Apart from the oil market, spillover channels from the euro area—non-oil exports and
financial linkages—appear limited (see SIP, Chapter IV).3 Non-oil exports to the euro area are
relatively small and likely to constitute a minor spillover channel. Financial cross-border spillover
effects appear minor, but information on the geographical distribution of foreign assets and
liabilities is limited. While three major European banks have significant ownership in three domestic
banks (that together account for one-fifth of the Saudi banking system’s total assets), the strong
performance of these Saudi intermediaries has been a source of strength for the parent institutions.
Additionally, cross-holdings in Europe of Saudi Arabian corporate conglomerates could comprise
another spillover channel, and private sector projects dependent on foreign financing could be
delayed (as witnessed in 2008–09 ) if the availability of external funds dries up.

Empirical spillover models also point to a limited growth impact from a slowdown in the euro area on Saudi
Arabia. These models suggest that the more significant impact would come via a slowdown in China—a one
standard deviation shock to growth in China is estimated to reduce growth in Saudi Arabia by 0.5 percent.

B. Strengthening Macroeconomic Management
The challenges facing macroeconomic policy-makers in Saudi Arabia are evolving. The oil price—
traditionally the driver of the fiscal stance—is increasingly being determined by developments in
emerging market economies, particularly China. Financial market deepening in Saudi Arabia means
that the impact of US monetary policy on the economy has increased. Thus the potential for the oil
cycle to diverge from the US business cycle—as happened in 2007/08—is increasing, raising the
potential for policy tensions. Such tensions highlight the need for strong macroeconomic institutions
and a broader range of policy tools (see SIP Chapter III).
19.
While the link between fiscal spending and oil revenues has weakened, insulating
fiscal policy from oil price volatility remains a key challenge. Fiscal spending volatility has fallen
over the past decade and the correlation between spending and oil revenue growth has declined.
Nevertheless, it was

margin. The authorities noted that while actual spending levels were generally above the budget
statement, a careful review process was undertaken in determining additional allocations that
were approved via supplementary budgets.
Control, quality, and efficiency of spending: The authorities noted that budgetary preparation and
controls at line ministries could be strengthened—and discussions on these issues were
underway with the assistance of both FAD and the World Bank. These efforts would also be
facilitated by finalizing the adoption of GFSM2001.



Box 2. Budget Institutions
Saudi Arabia has long-established budget institutions that have served the country well. A large quantity of
fiscal data is collected, but only limited information about fiscal developments is disseminated. A formal
medium term framework and disclosure of fiscal risks could be developed. The Ministry of Finance is
implementing reforms to strengthen budget reporting and data dissemination.
The Council of Ministers acts both as the executive and legislative wings of the government. It approves
expenditures and reviews budgetary performance. The Ministry of Finance exercises controls by comparing
expenditures against budgetary allocations.
The Ministry of Planning and Economy produces a five year development plan, which includes long term
macroeconomic and fiscal projections. New expenditure requests by line ministries must be first articulated
in the plan before they can be approved, while the annual budget sets rolling three year ceilings on public
sector investments. The relationship between the plan and annual budgetary planning could be enhanced
with a medium term fiscal framework covering both capital and current expenditures.
The Ministry of Finance is working on reforms to modernize accounting and reporting, including the
reclassification of data based on the GFSM 2001. Timely data are published for annual revenue performance
and expenditure out-turns. Quarterly fiscal performance reports are prepared by the ministry of finance and
circulated internally. The Ministry of Finance publishes data on government contracts as well as the income
and balance sheets of government investment funds.
While there is no formal identification of fiscal risks, there is a keen awareness of the risks to revenues
associated with oil prices. To counter fluctuations in government revenues, the authorities have built up
sizable fiscal buffers to smooth expenditures. On the expenditure side, a comprehensive risk assessment
could be undertaken.
Going forward, the authorities are focusing on the quality of spending in order to achieve their stated
developmental goals. Predictable budgets would allow ministries to focus on planning and enhancing
efficiency within a given amount of resources.

pressure.


Macro-prudential policies: SAMA has an extensive set of macroprudential tools. The authorities
noted that reflecting the difficulties in defining underlying triggers in an oil dependent
economy—such as thresholds for cyclical provisions—implementation has tended to emphasize
consultations with banks rather than strict reliance on automatic rules. And they noted that
banks have overprovisioned when profits were increasing—as per SAMA advice. They were
however continuing to work closely with the relevant standard setting bodies in establishing
relevant rules appropriate for the risks faced in Saudi Arabia. Staff noted that while provisioning
and capital buffers have been countercyclical with respect to non-oil GDP growth, banks may
not have provisioned enough during periods of credit expansions (Box 3). The authorities noted
that the risk associated with credit expansion was partially offset by the fact that a large part of
credit relates to personal loans that are secured against salaries.



Liquidity management: The authorities noted that, consistent with the 2011 FSAP Update
recommendations (see Appendix I), options to enhance the management of systemic liquidity,
potentially including a formal liquidity forecasting framework, were being explored.

21.
The exchange rate regime remains appropriate. The large role of imports and the
generally open economy means that the domestic price level and hence the real exchange rate have
been relatively unaffected by terms of trade shocks stemming from oil price volatility. While the
possibility of policy tensions has increased, it was agreed that the pegged exchange rate regime
continues to serve as an anchor for market expectations, facilitating financial sector development
and investment decisions, with the choice of currency appropriately aligned with the numeraire for
the dominant export. Ongoing deepening of financial markets, while supporting growth, will also
provide options over the medium-term for considering alternative exchange rate regimes—for
example at the time of the introduction of the GCC common currency. Models for assessing the real
exchange rate suggest that it is broadly in line with fundamentals (see Appendix II).

Box 3. Countercyclical Capital Buffers and Dynamic Provisioning
With a fixed exchange rate and a relatively open capital account, interest rates in Saudi Arabia will largely
move in line with those in the United States. SAMA still plays an important role in establishing prudential
policies to limit system-wide risk associated with excess swings in credit growth.
Two countercyclical macro-prudential policy regulations have been highlighted in Basel III, (i) countercyclical
capital buffering, and (ii) dynamic (or forward-looking) provisioning. The former is designed to protect
against unexpected losses while the latter deal with the need to protect against expected losses.

C. Growth and Job Creation
Despite diversification plans, the Saudi economy remains heavily dependent on oil exports with non-oil
growth lagging other emerging market economies and still driven by factor accumulation rather than
productivity growth (see SIP Chapter I). Enabling a more dynamic private sector through product and
labor market reforms, while better positioning Saudi nationals to fill the employment opportunities
created, would help address unemployment among nationals (see SIP Chapter II).

in foreign direct investment (FDI) from 0.4 to 10 percent of GDP between 2003 and 2009. Real nonoil growth averaged 3.4 percent per annum between 1990 and 2009, but productivity improvements

1.5 percentage points each. There is thus room to boost productivity through more efficient use of

Very low domestic energy prices create a clear distortion in the growth model. Staff

international levels. Indeed, over 85 percent of FDI flows to

Saudi nationals to take up such positions. Indeed, the authorities stressed that the new labor
market initiatives introduced in 2011 should be viewed as a package to create both a demand for
Saudi nationals and a supply of Saudi nationals equipped to productively assume the positions
created. They also noted, however, that sufficient information was not yet available to assess the
success of the new initiatives.

D. Financial Sector Development
Financial sector development has focused on stability resulting in a low risk system that has endured
significant shocks. The 2011 FSAP Update provided a number of options for advancing capital market
development and expanding access to finance (Appendix I). Good progress has been made in
implementing Basel III, and it is important to continue to ensure appropriate monitoring of emerging
risks—for example in the areas of housing finance and SME lending—and that new state funded
initiatives to accelerate progress in some segments of the financial markets serve to complement not
substitute private market development.
25.
Financial sector development has
accelerated in the past decade, but
important segments of the financial
system remain underdeveloped. Credit to
non-oil GDP increased from 39 to
91 percent between 2000 and 2011 and
stock market capitalization grew from 32 to
59 percent of GDP over the same time
period. Certain segments of the financial
system, such as fixed income securities, SME
financing, and mortgage lending, remain
relatively underdeveloped.

Supporting the emergence of a

place contain options for training in
management and accounting in addition
to partial credit guarantees that would
assist SMEs to transition from specialized
to regular lending facilities. The credit

bureau is also playing an increasingly important role in facilitating SME access to commercial bank
financing.
27.
Housing finance is an important emerging sector and the regulatory regime will need
to stay on top of the risks inherent in the various financing vehicles. The mortgage law (and the
accompanying enforcement provisions), have been approved by the Shura Council, but await final
passage into law. In the meantime, housing finance is emerging—while only about 2 percent of
commercial bank loans are classified as mortgages, real estate exposures are increasing through the
use of dedicated housing finance companies. A new business model of the Real Estate Development
Fund (REDF) is also in progress, including agreements with selected commercial banks to provide
bridge-financing for those awaiting loans from REDF.4 The mission urged SAMA to prioritize its work
on evaluating appropriate regulatory norms for the housing market to ensure that exposures are
contained and to capture in the regulatory and supervisory perimeter all entities and products
involved in the housing finance market which may give rise to risks for the financial system.
28.
Capital markets are deepening. The authorities noted that while domestic debt markets
remain thin—with minimal levels of secondary market trading—there had been an uptick in
corporate issuance, including by banks seeking to reduce maturity mismatches on their balance
sheets. The authorities continue to consider that the market will develop absent a sovereign yield
curve. The equity market has also seen renewed growth, but remains dominated by individual
investors and state institutions. Private institutional investors (such as mutual funds and insurance
companies) are relatively small, but starting to emerge. The authorities noted that the initial opening
of the market to foreign investors had generated benefits in terms of an expansion in the number of
companies listed and in strengthening disclosures. A further gradual opening is under consideration,
but it was agreed that this would need to be handled carefully given the uncertainties in global
financial markets.
29.
Saudi Arabia has taken several corrective actions to address deficiencies identified in
the AML/CTF mutual assessment report in 2010. Saudi Arabia reported to MENAFATF in May
2012 that several amendments to the AML law were approved in 2012 enhancing coverage and
adding new AML related provisions and that a draft CTF law is being developed. The authorities
strengthened the capacity of supervisory authorities of financial institutions and extended AML/CFT
supervision to nonfinancial institutions.

Significant progress has been made in strengthening statistical systems and

annual International Investment Position for 2007–10 and of quarterly real GDP data. Additional
steps are also underway: SAMA is in the process of submitting quarterly Financial Soundness
Indicators to the IMF as well as locational and consolidated bank data to the BIS; CPIS and CDIS data
are under preparation; and the compilation practices and coverage of the national accounts data are
being strengthened with assistance from STA with a view to implementing the 2008 SNA.
Improvements to fiscal data—including the compilation of data using GFSM 2001—are also under
discussion with both STA and the World Bank. The mission fully supports the ongoing initiatives as
well as the authorities’ interest in subscribing to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) in
the medium term, which provides a suitable objective for the ongoing initiatives to enhance
timeliness and coverage of economic statistics.

STAFF APPRAISAL
31.
Economic outcomes have been very strong. Buoyant oil revenues have—despite an
expansionary fiscal stance—resulted in large fiscal and external surpluses as a portion of the extra
revenues has, appropriately, been saved for future generations. Growth has picked up and is,
importantly, being driven by the private sector. Saudi Arabia’s actions to calm global oil markets by
increasing oil production in response to supply uncertainties have provided important support to
the global economy.
32.
Higher oil revenues have been used to address domestic developmental objectives
with positive spillovers to the region. Higher fiscal spending has been targeted to pressing social
needs—including housing and the introduction of new schemes to support jobseekers—that should
improve social outcomes. Financial assistance to the region has also been substantially scaled up,
with support to economies in the region and beyond also coming via increased remittances and
trade and investment flows.
33.
The outlook remains strong but subject to unusual uncertainty, emphasizing the need
to preserve flexibility in spending and to continue to ensure adequate policy space. While
strong growth has so far not led to overheating, if inflations risks materialize it will be important to
respond with a combination of tighter fiscal policy and proactive use of SAMA’s policy tools—
principally reserve requirements and the loan to deposit ratio. The level of fiscal spending is
currently above the level consistent with intergenerational equity in the consumption of oil wealth
and has raised vulnerabilities in the event that oil revenues decline. While there is significant policy
space, care should be taken to ensure both the efficiency of spending and that the composition of
spending is such as to preserve flexibility over the medium-term. Limiting increases in entitlement

spending and moving ahead with the VAT or other measures to broaden the tax base would
strengthen underlying fiscal balances and help ensure fiscal sustainability.
34.
The key risk to the outlook is the global oil market. Given the substantial oil reserves, and
notwithstanding efforts to diversify the economy, oil will be the cornerstone of the Saudi
economy—as well as the dominant source of fiscal and foreign exchange revenues—for many years
to come. The oil market poses both upside and downside risks, calling for strong budgetary and
financial institutions. While there has been significant progress in this area, further reducing the link
between fiscal spending and the oil price cycle would help provide economic stability. Accordingly,
efforts to strengthen budgetary institutions should continue, including through careful screening of
supplementary budgetary expenditures, establishing a macro-fiscal unit at the Ministry of Finance,
and ensuring that spending decisions are taken with respect to medium term priorities.
35.
The recent acceleration in private sector growth is welcome, but initiatives to increase
employment of Saudi nationals need to be managed carefully to limit the potentially adverse
effects on productivity. A dynamic private sector is key for creating sustainable employment
opportunities for the growing labor force. Recent labor market initiatives combine both tighter
regulations with new incentives to enhance the demand for Saudi employees, but the supply side
initiatives—training, job skills—are equally important to ensure that Saudi nationals are well
positioned to take up the new opportunities. Adjusting domestic energy prices, combined with
measures to protect the lower income groups, would enhance the efficiency with which energy
resources are used and also limit the bias in the growth strategy, which attracts investment in
energy-intensive sectors but creates little extra employment.
36.
Staff supports the fixed exchange rate regime and encourages steps to further
strengthen macroprudential instruments. The exchange rate peg to the U.S. dollar has provided
stability to support financial sector development and foster trade and investment. Staff estimates
suggest that the exchange rate is currently broadly in line with fundamentals. The combination of
the exchange rate peg and a relatively open capital account implies that there is limited scope for
interest rates to diverge from U.S. interest rates, placing a premium on effective macroprudential
instruments and liquidity management to help smooth credit in the event of divergences between
the U.S. and Saudi business cycles.
37.
The banking sector remains well capitalized and resilient to shocks. Prudent supervision
and the continued strengthening of risk management practices, consistent with the implementation
of Basel III, has resulted in a banking system that has withstood large shocks—oil price swings, the
stock market correction in 2006, the global financial crisis, and the crisis in the euro area. Financial
sector supervision needs though to stay on top of emerging risks—including those beyond the
banking system—such as in housing finance—and staff encouraged continued progress on
implementing the 2011 FSAP Update recommendations. In the AML/CFT area, following progress
made in the past year, the authorities should adopt a comprehensive CFT Law while pursuing their
AML implementation efforts.

There has been a significant improvement in the statistical database. The publication of
the IIP and quarterly real GDP data, as well as the numerous ongoing initiatives to strengthen
financial sector data is a significant advance. Efforts should continue to enhance the quality and
timely dissemination of fiscal data, including through the full adoption of GFSM2001 and to enhance
the quality of available data, particularly regarding the balance of payments.
39.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard
12-month cycle.

Appendix I. Progress with Respect to the Key Recommendations of the FSAP Update
Recommendation

Progress

Bank and Securities Regulation


Update the BCL and remove need for ministerial
approval of certain SAMA decisions.

SAMA’s assessment is that the existing BCL has
provided a strong basis for effective supervision.
Ministerial approval is only required in times of
extreme stress and is viewed by SAMA as a means
of ensuring communication with Cabinet.



No longer allow large exposure up to 50 percent of
bank’s own capital.

There have been no changes in the legislation.
However, SAMA expects banks to ensure that their
single exposure limit should not exceed 15 percent of
capital and reserves.



Strengthen the CMA’s regulatory transparency by fully
disclosing all enforcement actions, interpretation, and
funding rules.

The CMA has established an internal committee to
discuss relevant FSAP recommendations, including
disclosure policies.

Systemic Stability


Introduce a formal liquidity forecasting framework.

SAMA is currently assessing the need for a formal
liquidity forecasting model.



Enhance data on cross-border financial activities of
banks and corporate.

SAMA published the International Investment
Position in 2012 (annual basis), and is planning to
submit locational and consolidated bank data to the
BIS as well as a subset of quarterly FSI data to the
IMF by the end of 2012.



Maintain a stable stock of government securities and
regular issues to help anchor a robust yield curve

There are no plans to increase and maintain a stable
stock of government securities. However, public
sector entities have recently increased sukuk
issuance.



Introduce a payment system law.

The authorities believe that the current legal
framework is adequate and serving the purpose well.



Conduct stress tests with a wider range of shocks,
including liquidity shocks, on regular basis and
incorporate lessons into supervision.

Detailed rules on stress testing were issued in
November 2011, making stress testing mandatory.
SAMA has also developed a system-wide stress test,
covering credit, market, operational and liquidity
risks.



Establish a formal early warning system (EWS) for the
banking sector.

SAMA considers that its current off-site surveillance
system is adequate as a EWS.



Develop a more formal and transparent macroprudential
policy framework, drawing on work in international
fora.

SAMA is actively participating in the international
fora on macro-prudential frameworks and will
review its framework in line with emerging best
practices.



Strengthen the legal framework for bank resolution

The authorities will assess the need for any further
steps required to strengthen the existing bank
resolution framework.

Recommendation

Progress

Expanding Access to Finance and Preserving Financial Stability


As housing finance expands in the future, ensure loan
soundness through strong prudential measures, notably
lowering permissible loan-to-value and debt service
ratios.

Although the housing loans continue to grow,
SAMA believes that the current prudential measures
that are in place will ensure that banks are managing
the associated risks prudently.



Contract banks to manage both the existing and new
Real Estate Development Fund (REDF) portfolio.

As of now there are no plans to allow banks to
manage the portfolio of REDF.



Complement mortgage reform by establishing a housing
market observatory, developing consumer guidance
options, and strengthening the developer industry.

A separate Ministry of Housing has been established,
which will look into these and any other related
issues.



Prepare long-term funding solution for mortgage
finance, starting with a refinance facility.

REDF is considering several options to enhance its
integration with the banking sector, including longterm funding facility.



Create a modern, electronic and unified registry for
movable collateral.

The authorities will assess the need to further study
the proposal.



Enact and implement the draft Enforcement law that
introduces specialized enforcement courts operating
with strict time-bound procedures.

The Mortgage Law, which includes the Enforcement
Law, was approved by the Shoura Council in 2011,
and still is in the process of final approval.



Closely supervise the quality of SME units in the banks,
including the robustness or their internal rating systems
and automated procedures.

All banks have been required to set up their own
separate SME units in order to more effectively deal
with SME financing.

Insurance, Institutional Investors, and Capital Markets


Finalize and issue the outstanding functional regulations
for insurance

Several regulations were passed in 2011 and 2012,
including the investment, reinsurance, online
transactions, AML/CFT, motor insurance, and
intermediaries regulations.



Improve enforcement of mandatory motor third party
liability insurance

The authorities have formed a joint Working Group
to look into this proposal.



Disclose the investment policies, portfolio, and portfolio
performance of the Public Pension Agency (PPA) and
General Organization for Social Insurance (GOSI).

There have been no changes in the disclosure
policies of PPA and GOSI. GOSI have established a
committee to discus disclosure issues.



Further outsource the management of portfolio of the
PPA and GOSI.

PPA and GOSI have no plans to outsource part of
their domestic portfolio. The foreign portfolios are
outsourced to a large degree.



Permit foreign international investors to invest directly
in Tadawul.

The CMA has no immediate plans to allow foreign
investors to invest directly in the equity market. A
step as such would be adopted carefully and
gradually.

Appendix II: External Sustainability and Exchange Rate Assessment
Preliminary estimates from CGER-type methodologies – tailored to oil exporters – indicate that the
current account and the real effective exchange rate are broadly in line with fundamentals, with some
evidence of undervaluation from the external sustainability models.

Despite terms of trade gains, the real exchange rate has appreciated by only 1 percent

The macroeconomic balance approach suggests the current account is within the range
of estimated medium term norms. The macroeconomic balance approach estimates four main
specifications of the equilibrium current account (norm) from a set of fundamentals (non-oil and gas
fiscal balance, oil and gas reserves, old-age dependency ratio, population growth rate, initial net
foreign assets (NFA) net of external debt, oil trade balance, growth rate of real per capita GDP, relative
income, and lagged dependent current account) employing a generalized method of moments (GMM)
technique. As shown (in the table below), the estimation yields a range of current account norms for
Saudi Arabia from a surplus of about 8 to 21 percent of GDP in 2017. The projected current account
position in 2017 is a surplus of 12 percent of GDP, which lies well within the estimated range of
current account norms.

The external sustainability approach suggests that the current account is on the stronger
side of fundamentals. The underpinning of this approach is that the sustainability of the current
account trajectory requires that the net present value (NPV) of all future oil and financial/investment
income (wealth) be equal to the NPV of imports of goods and services net of non-oil exports. Subject
to this constraint, the government would choose a path for imports, and hence a current account
norm, that would support intergenerational equity—and some precautionary savings in view of
volatile oil prices—through an
appropriate pace of

functions. Both rules suggest that the current account balance is on the strong side of the
fundamentals with: rule (i) implying a current account norm surplus of 12 percent of GDP, while the
less generous rule (ii) implies a current account norm of 5 percent of GDP. These results are very
sensitive to the assumed parameters.

Assuming for illustrative purposes 267 billion barrels of reserves, a 77 percent recovery rate, oil production would
peak at 11.8 million barrels in 2029 before declining gradually (2.0 percent). Domestic consumption and production
costs include imports to develop and maintain production valued at 8 percent of the value of oil production (WEO
prices). Oil prices and the GDP deflator increase by 2 percent after 2015, and real non-oil GDP grows by 5 percent while
total real growth is assumed to be 3 percent. Future oil revenues are nominally discounted at 6 percent, the assumed
rate of return on externally held financial wealth/NFA, while population growth is 1 percent.

Lending to the Fund and Grants:
Saudi Arabia has consented to the amendments of the NAB Decision and the increases of credit
arrangements of participants as approved by the Executive Board on April 12, 2010 (Executive Board
Decision No. 14577-(10/35), increasing its own credit arrangement in the expanded NAB to SDR
11.13 billion, from SDR 1.76 billion. The current outstanding amount as of April 30, 2012 is SDR
1,135.40 million. The Fund also has a borrowing agreement with Saudi Arabia in association with the
General Arrangements to Borrow (GAB), for an amount equivalent to SDR 1.5 billion, which was
renewed for another five-year period from December 26, 2008. The Fund as Trustee of the Poverty
Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT) entered into a borrowing agreement with the Saudi Arabian
Monetary Agency in May 2011, by which Saudi Arabia would provide new loan resources of up to
SDR 500 million. In May 2012, Saudi Arabia pledged a new grant contribution of SDR 16.7 million in
subsidy resources to the PRGT, which will be disbursed at end-December 2021, and also provided
assurance for additional subsidy contribution to the PRGT through the transfer of its full share in the
distribution of the general reserve attributed to windfall gold sale profits. In March 2001,

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SAUDI ARABIA

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

Saudi Arabia agreed to support the PRG-HIPC Trust with investments totaling SDR 94.4 million. In
April 2006, these investments were extended with an additional investment of SDR 38.2 million, to
provide SDR 40 million (end-2005 NPV terms) in subsidy resources to support the Exogenous
Shocks Facility. In February 1989, Saudi Fund for Development disbursed SDR 49.5 million in PRGT
loan resources, which were fully drawn and repaid by September 2004.
Exchange Rate Arrangement
Saudi Arabia maintains an exchange rate system free of restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers for current international transactions. The Saudi Arabian riyal was formally pegged to the
U.S. dollar, effective January 2003. Prior to that, it was officially pegged to the SDR at the rate of
SRls 4.28255=SDR 1, with margins of 7.25 percent even though in practice it has been pegged to the
U.S. dollar since 1986, with a middle rate of SRls 3.7450=$1. Saudi Arabia maintains security-related
exchange restrictions pursuant to UN Security Council resolutions 1267 and 1373. These securityrelated restrictions should be notified to the Fund pursuant to Decision No.144-(52/51).
Last Article IV Consultation
Saudi Arabia is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle. The last Article IV consultation was
held during May 10–25, 2011 in Riyadh. The staff report was considered by the Executive Board on
July 18, 2011 and published on September 21, 2011.

ANNEX II. RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
The World Bank’s Technical Cooperation Program (TCP) has been providing policy advice, capacity
development, and implementation support to development efforts in Saudi Arabia on a
reimbursable basis since 1975. In 2006, Saudi authorities agreed to move the program from an
annual to a three year planning horizon in order to promote a programmatic engagement in certain
areas.
The TCP aims to assist Saudi Arabia in addressing its development challenges of generating
productive jobs for a fast growing population; improving the performance of its health system to
meet evolving needs; strengthening social safety net mechanisms; enhancing the provision of public
services including water, electricity, transport, health and education; and strengthening capacity in
national and municipal organizations.
Among priority activities in the FY13–15 program are: work on unemployment assistance and
unemployment insurance; work with credit and savings bank on developing their strategy, savings
schemes and capacity development for potential SME entrepreneurs in business plan formulation,
accounting and marketing; education indicators and bench marking; analytical work on the costs
and benefits of developing renewable energy; develop the strategic program for the newly created
Council for health services; updating the water sector strategy and building a national consensus
around it; developing links with civil society to complement public sector social safety net efforts;
and updating a national ports strategy.
Since 2007, the IFC Office has been co-located with the World Bank Office in Riyadh. IFC activities in
the country, as well as with Saudi investors outside the country, have increased significantly. They
are in line with the following three objectives:
Promote Selective Business in Saudi Arabia
IFC’s strategy for investments in Saudi Arabia is to invest in selective transactions that can add value
in terms of institution building, development of new financial instruments and SME development.
Specific investments in the financial sector include housing finance, insurance, leasing, microfinance
and a student loan program (with total commitments around $200 million). IFC also provides
Advisory Services in mortgage finance, SME finance, corporate governance, risk management and
PPP transactions.
Promote South-South Investments from Saudi Arabia
Many Saudi investors are looking to expand outside of their home-base. This is an opportunity for
IFC to work with such companies and invest with them inside and outside the MENA region. IFC
Riyadh office increased its activity, especially in facilitating south-south investments that reached

around $1.1 billion in IDA and middle income countries (Pakistan, Egypt, Yemen, Ethiopia, Ghana,
etc.). IFC continues to work closely with Saudi sponsors to further facilitate cross border investment
in the region.
Mobilize Funds from Saudi Public Sector
IFC is working closely with the Saudi Public Institutions to undertake global initiatives that benefit
private sector activities in developing countries. So far, these efforts have resulted in obtaining
commitments of over US$ 500 million. The current commitments include US$ 300 million from Saudi
Fund for Development (SFD) for Global Trade Liquidity Program (GTLP), US$100 million from the
Public Investment Fund (PIF) for IFC Africa, Latin America & Caribbean Fund and US$ 100 million
from OPEC Fund for International Development (OFID) for GTLP, Microfinance Fund and Africa
Capitalization Fund. In addition, IsDB contributed US$5 million to IFC’s Advisory Services program,
and has agreed to a new contribution of $2 million. IsDB has also contributed $1 million for IFC’s
Education for Employment (E4E) initiative. Recently IsDB signed the Subscription Agreement with IFC
for the Arab Financing Facility for Infrastructure (AFFI) initiative where IsDB will participate with $50
million and IFC with another $50 million in this fund (total fund size expected at $300 million).

ANNEX III. STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of May 30, 2012)
Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. Most
affected areas are: national accounts, government finance statistics, and balance of payments.
National Accounts: Annual and quarterly estimates of GDP are calculated at current and
constant prices (with 1999 as a base year). However, incomplete coverage and reliance on the
consumer price index to deflate value added for non-oil activities could affect the accuracy and
reliability of estimates.
Government finance statistics: The authorities are reclassifying the budget in line with GFSM
2001. Most chapters have been completed and the Ministry of Finance is planning on using the
GFSM 2001 framework to report fiscal data.
Balance of Payments: The authorities are now publishing an annual IIP. However, the coverage
in the capital and financial accounts, particularly for the private sector, needs to be improved,
and the errors and omissions remain sizable.

Statement by the Staff Representative on Saudi Arabia
June 26, 2012
The information below has become available following the issuance of the staff report. It
does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
As of mid-June, oil prices—spot and futures—have weakened, implying smaller fiscal
and current account surpluses and reinforcing the importance of strong budgetary
institutions. As shown in table below, assuming unchanged oil production and fiscal
spending levels, the lower oil prices will reduce both fiscal and current account surpluses by
about 4½ percent of GDP in 2012, with the impact declining over the medium-term. Both
fiscal and external accounts remain in surplus, although the reduced fiscal surpluses highlight
the need to ensure that expenditure policies remain consistent with medium and long-term
objectives.
Saudi Arabia is now a participant in the Coordinated Direct Investment Survey. Data
on the sources of inward foreign direct investment are now available on http://cdis.imf.org/.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes the 2012 Article IV Consultation
with Saudi Arabia
On July 2, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Saudi Arabia.1
Background
Saudi Arabia provided important support to the global economy in 2011 by raising oil production
to help stabilize global oil markets. The commitment to provide $15 billion in additional
resources for the IMF has also contributed to global stability. Adverse spillovers from unrest in
the region and the euro area crisis have been limited so far. Higher oil revenues have been
used to accelerate domestic developmental objectives as well as to support other economies in
the region and beyond.
The pace of economic expansion accelerated in 2011. Overall real GDP growth reached
7.1 percent, and the non-oil economy grew by 8 percent—the highest since 1981. Despite
increased economic activity, inflation stabilized at 5 percent as food inflation subsided and
imports of capital goods and labor helped prevent bottlenecks from emerging.
New initiatives to address pressing social issues such as unemployment, availability of
affordable housing, and SME financing, translated into an increase in real government spending
of 20 percent. Nevertheless, despite increased spending and strong import growth, fiscal and
external surpluses strengthened further in 2011 as oil revenues rose. Monetary aggregates
grew strongly in 2011 and credit growth reached double digits as the economic expansion
translated into increased demand for credit. Consistent with the peg to the U.S. dollar, monetary

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

policy remained accommodative and policy rates remained unchanged. The banking system
remained highly capitalized and liquid with improved profitability.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the authorities’ efforts to stabilize oil markets and noted the
positive spillover to the region from Saudi Arabia’s higher growth, public spending, and
expanded financial assistance. Higher oil revenues have strengthened fiscal and external
balances and have boosted social spending and savings for future generations. The near-term
economic outlook is broadly favorable, although geopolitical risks and oil prices remain sources
of volatility.
Directors stressed the need to forestall any inflation pressures engendered by robust growth
through a proactive use of liquidity and macroprudential policy tools. They also noted that, while
the government has built significant policy buffers, fiscal spending is above the level consistent
with an intergenerationally equitable drawdown of oil wealth. Accordingly, they highlighted the
importance of preserving flexibility in entitlements, ensuring efficiency in spending, and
broadening the tax base.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ efforts to strengthen budget institutions and further delink
fiscal spending from oil price developments. They encouraged the authorities to continue to
improve the budgetary process, including by carefully screening supplementary budgetary
expenditures, establishing a macro-fiscal unit, and anchoring spending decisions in a multi-year
framework.
Directors noted the recent initiatives to increase employment of Saudi nationals in the private
sector and the complementary supply-side efforts to boost their skills. Adjusting domestic
energy prices would enhance the efficiency of resource use and could also have beneficial
employment effects, while facilitating economic diversification.
Directors agreed that the fixed exchange rate continues to serve Saudi Arabia well. Since the
peg limits the scope for monetary policy conduct, the use of macroprudential and liquidity
management tools remains key to effective policymaking.
Directors commended the authorities’ efforts to strengthen financial supervision and risk
management, as well as their progress toward adopting Basel III standards. They encouraged
continued implementation of the FSAP Update recommendations and welcomed improvements
in the AML/CFT regime. Directors also welcomed progress made in strengthening the statistical
system, but called for further measures to improve data quality, availability, and timeliness.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.
