IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with the Republic of
Poland
On June 27, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV Consultation1 with Poland.
The economy is enjoying a strong economic expansion, but external factors continue to
weigh on inflation. Unemployment has come down rapidly, and the economy is operating at
close to full capacity. Growth is projected to remain strong in 2016 and accelerate to 3.7
percent in 2017, on the back of strong private consumption supported by the new child
benefit scheme, before moderating over the medium term. A positive output gap next year
should help gradually nudge inflation toward the central bank’s target by end-2017.
Downside risks have intensified. Externally, a protracted period of slow growth in the euro
area, accompanied by financial market volatility, and a marked slowdown in emerging
markets could propagate into Poland. Domestically, controversial policy initiatives or fiscal
slippages could worsen investor sentiment and hinder economic expansion. Over the longer
term, a rapidly aging population poses important challenges to potential growth and fiscal
sustainability. At the same time, enduring income disparities between Poland’s prosperous
west and the lagging east could undermine the quality of growth.
The government’s declared policy priorities focus on supporting a strong and inclusive
growth, but some recent initiatives have weakened market sentiment. Fulfillment of election
promises is expected to increase the budget deficit to 2.8 percent of GDP in 2016 and to over
3 percent of GDP in 2017, resulting in a pro-cyclical fiscal stance. The government plans to
resume fiscal consolidation at a rate of ¾ percentage points of GDP a year from 2018. The
banking sector remains well capitalized amid weakening profitability, but recent proposals to
convert FX mortgages into zloty, if implemented, could undermine financial stability and
further dent market confidence.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors noted that Poland is enjoying a strong economic expansion, with the
economy operating at close to full capacity and unemployment coming down rapidly,
reflecting Poland’s progress in building strong fundamentals and policy buffers in recent
years. They cautioned, however, that a weakening of institutions and policies or fiscal
slippages could worsen investor sentiment and hinder economic expansion. They, therefore,
encouraged the authorities to maintain sound institutions and growth-friendly policies, and
advance structural reforms to support inclusive growth. Such policies would enhance
resilience and, together with the Fund-supported Flexible Credit Line arrangement, provide
strong insurance against external shocks.
Directors noted that the current accommodative monetary policy stance is appropriate and
has helped support growth and maintain longer-term inflation expectations within the
inflation target band. They urged the authorities to remain vigilant, noting that additional
monetary easing could be needed if inflation expectations were to disappoint or if growth
were to slow down sharply.
Directors observed that the banking sector remains well-capitalized amid weakening
profitability. They stressed the importance of safeguarding financial sector stability, and
welcomed the strengthened financial sector framework now in place, including the new bank
resolution framework, which should now be implemented. However, Directors generally
expressed concern that the new bank asset tax could undermine credit expansion and growth.
They welcomed the authorities’ willingness to assess the performance of the new tax and
adjust its design if necessary, and encouraged them to consider a more growth-friendly tax.
They also took note of the proposals to restructure foreign exchange-denominated mortgages
and stressed that any decision in this regard should be mindful of the potential impact on
banks and financial stability. They noted that a case-by-case approach to restructuring
mortgages held by distressed borrowers rather than a blanket mortgage conversion would
avoid risks of destabilizing the financial sector.
Directors concurred that the authorities’ medium-term objective of 1 percent of GDP
structural deficit remains appropriate, allowing for sufficient fiscal space to deal with
external shocks and to address looming demographic challenges. In this regard, most
Directors considered it necessary to resume fiscal consolidation without delay to take
advantage of favorable cyclical conditions. Directors stressed that deficit reduction should be
underpinned by growth-friendly measures to help support market confidence and maintain
budget financing on favorable terms. They recommended maintaining the 2011 VAT
increase, rationalizing discretionary government consumption, and reducing sizable VAT
policy and compliance gaps. In this context, they welcomed the authorities’ plans to

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views
of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any

strengthen tax administration. Noting the need to reduce the risk of old-age poverty under the
current pension system, Directors encouraged the authorities to maintain the legislated
retirement age increases, which would also avoid adversely impacting the budget and
improve labor force participation.
Directors encouraged the authorities to continue to implement structural reforms to boost
productivity and promote inclusive growth. In this regard, they welcomed the authorities’
plans to increase access to vocational training and promote innovation, including through
targeted tax incentives for start-ups. Directors advised that reducing regional disparities
would require improving educational attainment in Poland’s east, scaling up public
infrastructure to attract investment to poorer regions, and facilitating labor mobility.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
June 10, 2016

KEY ISSUES
Context. Poland continued its convergence to average EU income levels, growing well
above most of its peers. Yet, significant regional disparities and long-term structural
challenges remain. The new government, which took office in November 2015, has
introduced a number of new policies, some of which have dented investor sentiment
and could weaken growth going forward. The near-term outlook is for continued
expansion with low oil prices weighing on inflation. External risks to the outlook remain
elevated and prospects of controversial policy initiatives have heightened domestic risks.
Sound institutions, growth-friendly policies, and structural reforms are critical to achieve
sustainable and inclusive growth.
Monetary policy. The current accommodative monetary policy stance is appropriate,
and has helped support growth and maintain longer-term inflation expectations within
the tolerance band. To support inflation’s return to the target, interest cuts could be
needed in the event of downside surprises.
Fiscal policy. Fiscal consolidation should resume already in 2017 to take advantage of
favorable economic conditions. The distortionary tax on bank assets could slow credit
expansion and investment, and should be replaced with a more growth-friendly tax on
bank profits and remuneration. The planned reversal of the 2013 retirement age
increases should be reconsidered to safeguard public finances and labor force
participation by seniors.
Financial sector policy. The financial sector remains well capitalized amid declining
profitability. Recent proposals for blanket conversion of Swiss franc mortgages into zloty,
if implemented, risk undermining financial stability, with adverse implications for credit
and growth. Instead, the focus should be on supporting distressed mortgage holders on
a case-by-case basis. Prompt completion of the bank resolution framework would
further strengthen the financial safety net.
Structural reforms. To promote sustainable and inclusive growth, reforms should focus
on boosting labor force participation and productivity, and reducing regional economic
disparities.

CONTEXT
1.
Poland has enjoyed strong economic performance in recent years. Thanks to its sound
policies, close links to the German supply chain, and substantial EU transfers, Poland was the only
country in the EU that avoided an outright recession during the global financial crisis. Steady
economic convergence has allowed Poland to close more than a quarter of its per-capita income
gap with the EU during the past two decades (Figure 1). By any means, this is an important
achievement.

However, this strong performance has masked enduring regional disparities, which are
undermining the quality of growth. Eastern regions in Poland—dominated by small-scale
farming—have lower per-capita GDP, productivity, and educational attainment levels, while also
exhibiting higher poverty and long-term unemployment rates. Despite strong overall economic
growth, the east has not been catching up to the west (Figure 2).
3.
Going forward, Poland is also facing important long-term challenges as an aging
population weighs on potential growth and public finances. With net emigration flows to the EU
continuing and birth rates among the lowest in the EU, the working-age (15–64) population is set to
shrink by more than 30 percent by 2060, resulting in almost a tripling of the old-age dependency
ratio (Figure 3). If left unaddressed, these trends will ultimately reduce potential growth and increase
healthcare and pension-related spending, weakening public finances.

The new government’s priorities focus on strong and inclusive growth. The
government, which took office in November, has approved a Responsible Development Plan,
focusing on spurring growth through innovation and reducing social and regional disparities. The
plan identifies five main pillars of economic policy to address long-term growth challenges:
(i) reindustrialization—by promoting specializations where Poland could have a competitive
advantage, supporting partnerships for strategic sectors, and attracting high-tech foreign direct
investment (FDI); (ii) development of innovative firms—by improving the business environment,
promoting start-ups, and enhancing cooperation between business and academia; (iii) mobilizing
capital for development—by promoting domestic savings and better utilizing EU funds; (iv) foreign
expansion by Polish companies abroad—by creating a strong Polish brand; and (v) social and
regional development—by reversing unfavorable demographic trends, strengthening vocational
education to match local market needs, and developing infrastructure in poorer regions. The
government is working on specific measures to underpin the implementation of the program.
5.
Yet, some recent policy initiatives have dampened market confidence and could
weaken growth going forward. In particular, the new tax on banks could undermine credit
expansion, investment, and growth. Conversion of foreign currency mortgages into zloty is being
considered, and depending on its design and implementation, could adversely impact financial
stability. And though the new child benefits program is likely to reduce inequality and poverty, it will
complicate the needed fiscal consolidation, and could discourage female labor force participation.
Furthermore, efforts to reform key institutions have raised concerns. The Venice Commission has
voiced its opinion that recent changes to the Constitutional Tribunal endanger the rule of law. These
changes have also prompted the European Commission to initiate a dialogue within the Rule of Law
Framework and have contributed to a rating downgrade by S&P in January and a downward revision
of the outlook by Moody’s in May. In turn, financial market volatility has increased, foreign investor
sentiment has soured, and spreads vis-à-vis German bunds have widened (Figure 12).

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
6.
Growth has remained strong. Real GDP growth rate reached 3.6 percent in 2015,1 up from
3.3 percent in 2014, driven by strong domestic demand (Figure 13). Private consumption has been
supported by declining prices, a low and declining unemployment rate, and continued robust wage
growth, which boosted disposable income. Healthy credit expansion and still-accommodative
financial conditions—in part on the back of quantitative easing (QE) in the euro area—helped
support private investment. However, following strong real GDP growth of 4 percent (year-on-year)
in the fourth quarter, the first quarter of this year recorded a growth slowdown to 2.6 percent.
Nonetheless, the Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) has remained in expansionary territory into 2016,
retail sales grew at 5½ percent year-on-year in April, and manufacturing sentiment has remained
positive (Figure 4).

Financial conditions have remained supportive. A historically low policy interest rate since
March 2015, low yields on local-currency government bonds, and QE by the European Central Bank
(ECB) have continued to support financial conditions (Figure 5). While credit expansion has
moderated recently, it has generally held up well alongside broadly unchanged credit standards in
recent quarters—with the exception of housing loans, where tighter standards were associated with
new prudential recommendations and reduced appetite among some banks to expand their
housing loan portfolios. However, despite some gains during the first months of the year, Polish
equities as of mid-May remained more than 15 percent below the level one year earlier, following
sustained stock market losses starting in May last year. While long-term bond yields have remained
close to recent lows, spreads to German bunds have widened by some 70 basis points between endSeptember 2015 and end-May 2016 (Figure 12).

Labor market conditions have continued to improve but inflation remains very low.
The seasonally-adjusted harmonized unemployment rate has been on a declining trajectory for
about three years, reaching 6.3 percent in April, a historical low, as employment strengthened.
Alongside, year-on-year nominal wage growth has remained robust at above 3 percent in the first
quarter, boosting real wages and outperforming labor productivity growth. Yet, inflation remains
subdued at -0.9 percent in May, amid weak imported inflation, in particular related to low
commodity prices and euro area inflation, which have had both direct and indirect spillovers on
Poland (Figure 14).2 Core inflation has also turned negative, most recently at -0.4 percent in May.
Nonetheless, while longer-term inflation expectations at the monetary policy horizon have declined
somewhat, they remain anchored within the inflation tolerance band (1.5 to 3.5 percent).
9.
The external position has improved. Poland’s current account deficit declined from
2 percent of GDP in 2014 to 0.2 percent of GDP in 2015, reflecting improved terms of trade—in light
of a close to 50 percent drop in oil prices—and moderately weaker non-oil imports. However,
financial flows weakened as a result of reinvestment of earnings by special purpose vehicles and
portfolio outflows. The overall external position in 2015 was consistent with fundamentals and
desirable policies (Figure 15, Box 1, Annex I), and reserves are broadly adequate, standing at about
107 percent of the IMF’s composite reserve adequacy metric at the end of last year.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
10.
On the basis of current policies, the
outlook is for continued strong growth and
rising but low inflation. Real growth is expected
to remain at 3½ percent in 2016 and accelerate
to 3.7 percent in 2017 on the back of strong
private consumption, boosted by a new child
benefits program,3 opening a positive output
gap. This, together with dissipating effects from
external price shocks, should help gradually
nudge inflation toward the lower bound of the
target band (1.5–3.5 percent) by the end of 2017
(Figure 6).

According to CenEA think tank estimates, the 500+ child benefits program would reduce poverty and inequality.
Specifically, disposable income of the poorest households with at least one child (lower decile) will increase by
30 percent, while the richest households (top decile) will gain only 2 percent. The median household with children
will receive an additional PLN400 per month, yielding 9 percent higher disposable income.

REPUBLIC OF POLAND

Box 1. Poland: External Sector Assessment
The external position in 2015 was broadly consistent with medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies.
However, vulnerabilities exist.
Current account. Poland’s current account deficit declined from 2 percent of GDP in 2014 to 0.2 percent of
GDP in 2015, largely reflecting improved terms of trade and somewhat weaker non-oil import volume. The
oil deficit declined from 3.2 percent of GDP in 2014 to 2 percent in 2015 as oil prices fell by close to
50 percent. In 2016, the current account deficit is projected to widen on the back of stronger domestic
demand. The current account is broadly consistent with fundamentals and desirable policies.
Real exchange rate. The average real effective exchange rate (REER) depreciated by 3 percent in 2015
relative to 2014, largely reflecting nominal depreciation vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar and the Swiss franc. The
REER has depreciated about 2 percent as of April 2016 relative to its end 2015 level. Various approaches
suggest a modest undervaluation between 2 and 14 percent. The REER gap implied by the current account
approach is -2 percent; the external sustainability approach suggests a REER gap of -6 percent; -5 percent
using the REER index regression approach; and -14 percent using the levels approach. Owing to large
residuals in the REER-level regressions, staff puts more weight on the other approaches. Hence, staff
assesses Poland’s real exchange rate in 2015 to be close to a level consistent with fundamentals and
desirable policy settings with the REER gap centered around -5 percent within a range of -10 to 0 percent.
Capital and financial account. Bond and equity markets have experienced portfolio investment outflows
since the second quarter of 2015. The larger outflows in the first two months of 2016, which were in part
driven by maturing external debt, also reflect a more general EM asset sell-off on the back of heightened
global risks. Foreign direct investment (FDI) also declined, mainly reflecting reinvestment of earnings by
special purpose vehicles. EU funds—which finance the bulk of the current account and experienced a
temporary decline in 2015 at the end of the EU budget cycle—are expected to increase in 2016. Although
some of the decline in net FDI inflows was temporary, financing a widening current account in the event of
oil price reversal could prove challenging if FDI inflows fall significantly below current projections.
Foreign assets and liabilities. A large negative net international investment position (NIIP) remained
broadly stable at around -60 percent of GDP in 2014 and 2015 as the valuation effects resulting from the
depreciation of the zloty against the U.S. dollar and the Swiss Franc were offset by an improved current
account balance. Associated vulnerabilities are mitigated by diversified FDI liabilities (accounting for over 40
percent of foreign liabilities) and related intercompany lending.
Reserve adequacy. Reserves are broadly adequate at about 107 percent of the IMF’s modified composite
reserve adequacy metric at end-2015.

11.


Risks to the outlook are increasingly on the downside (Text-Table 1).
External. Downside external risks have increased moderately since the 2016 Flexible Credit Line
(FCL) review.


10

Downside risk. Unanticipated changes in growth and financial fundamentals in large
economies could heighten financial volatility, which could be further exacerbated should
British voters decide to leave the European Union. Persistently low inflation and debt
overhang in the euro area could result in a protracted growth slowdown, spilling over to
Poland through both trade and financial channels. A significant slowdown in large emerging
markets (EMs) could raise risk aversion and trigger an EM asset sell-off, propagating to
Poland through high foreign investor participation in the bond market.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF POLAND

Upside risk. Stronger-than-expected growth in the euro area on the back of ECB QE could
further lift growth and inflation in Poland. A faster pick-up in oil prices could speed up
convergence of inflation to target.

Domestic. While some new policy measures may boost near-term growth, domestic policies
have increased uncertainty.


Downside risk. The medium-term outlook is increasingly uncertain in light of new policies
and potential weakening of key institutions. Distortionary sectoral taxes could further weigh
on investor sentiment. Lending activity could shift to less regulated non-banks, increasing
vulnerabilities. Conversion of foreign-currency mortgages into zloty, depending on its
design and implementation, could wipe out bank profits and significantly dent capital
adequacy, putting financial stability at risk. Fiscal slippages could also occur given uncertain

yield of announced measures, legal risks, and in light of additional measures under
consideration (e.g., a potential reduction in the pension age). A higher perceived risk of
political and social instability and policy unpredictability could make Poland less attractive to
foreign investors. All these risks could trigger additional rating downgrades and increase
debt servicing costs (Figure 7). External factors could continue to depress inflation and weigh
on interest margins, bank profitability, and growth. In a tail-risk scenario, inflation
expectations could become dislodged and have negative implications for the real economy.4


Upside risk. Near-term expansionary measures could provide a larger-than-expected boost
to growth. Inflation could also pick up sooner than expected.

Policy Recommendations

 Investors could reallocate assets away
from Poland, resulting in capital flow
reversals and zloty depreciation.

 The exchange rate should be allowed to
float freely, but intervention could be used
to dampen excessive volatility.

 Liquidity in the FX derivatives market
could be adversely affected, increasing
banks’ hedging costs.

 Fiscal policy should allow automatic
stabilizers to work as needed.

 Risks are mitigated by strong liquidity
positions in the banking sector and
prudent public debt management.

Medium

 Indirect trade linkages to China through
the German supply chain would lower
Polish exports to Germany and other CEE
countries.

 Interest rate hikes could be used to stem
capital outflow pressure. The Narodowy
Bank Polski (NBP) should provide liquidity
support (including in FX) if needed. The FCL
arrangement could be used if it becomes
necessary.

 Monetary policy should be further eased.
 Fiscal automatic stabilizers should be
allowed to operate.

 Financial volatility raises risk aversion,
causing capital outflows from emerging
markets, including Poland.

Medium

 Significant trade linkages with Europe
would weaken growth in Poland through
lower exports and adverse confidence
effects.
 NPLs would increase as growth slows.
 Risks are mitigated by relatively stable
investor base and the banking sector’s
strong capital position.

 To the extent that household inflation

breaking out of a protracted low inflation
environment could be more difficult than

 Ratings downgrades could push up
financing costs. Increased policy
uncertainty would make Poland less
attractive to foreign investors.

 The new bank tax could reduce profits, deter
credit expansion, and shift lending activity to
shadow banks. A retail sales tax could
discourage retail activity and result in cascading
taxation.

 Interaction of fiscal and financial sector
measures could result in a vicious cycle of
weaker public finances and financial
sector health and lower growth.

 Costly conversion of foreign currency mortgages
could put financial stability at risk.
 Lowering the retirement age would reduce
pension replacement rates and labor force
participation.

 Reduced pension replacement rates

would increase the risk of old-age
poverty, with associated higher reliance
on social benefits, and significantly
weaken public finances. Lower labor force
participation would reduce potential
growth.

 Maintain strong policies and institutions,
including a credible fiscal policy and central
bank independence, as these are
prerequisites for durable and sustainable
growth.
 Refrain from introducing destabilizing
policies, including blanket conversion of
foreign currency mortgages.
 Reconsider reducing pension age.

 Heightened global financial volatility with
potential for knock-on risks from financial

 Direct financial links to the U.K. are
limited, but indirect links through
financial spillovers to the euro area could
affect Polish banks and corporates that
rely on foreign funding.

 Slowdown of direct trade with the U.K. and
indirect trade via other EU trading partners.

 The impact would depend on the nature
of the possible new relationship between
the U.K. and the EU. The U.K. is Poland’s
second largest trading partner,
accounting for 7 percent of exports, with
added indirect trade via other EU
economies, implying economically
important negative impact on Poland’s
exports and growth.

 Lower EU fund transfers, assuming no
compensation for lost contribution from the U.K.
 Restrictions on migration to U.K.

 Reduction of EU fund inflows could weigh
on medium-term growth.

 Restricted migration to the U.K. and

higher return migration could increase
the domestic labor supply and
unemployment (in the short term). Lower
remittances would worsen the current
account. At the same time, return
migration could increase skill transfer,
and migration to the U.K. could be
replaced by other destinations.

Near term:
 The exchange rate should continue to play
a cushioning role.
 Fiscal policy should allow automatic
stabilizers to work as needed.
 The NBP should provide liquidity support
(including in FX) if needed. The FCL
arrangement could be used if it becomes
necessary.
 Active labor market policies could help
mitigate adverse implications of changing
migration flows.
Medium term:
 Continue fiscal consolidation with growthfriendly measures to support growth.
 Maintain financial stability to weather
external financial shocks.

The RAM shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s
subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a
probability of 30 percent or more). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually
exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

Policy Recommendations

REPUBLIC OF POLAND

12.
Appropriate policy responses to risks, if they materialize, would depend on
circumstances.
External. Poland’s strong fundamentals, reserve buffers, and a stable and diversified foreign
investor base serve to mitigate adverse financial spillovers. In the most recent episode of
capital outflows from EMs, Poland fared well relative to peers (Figure 8). Poland’s FCL
arrangement with the IMF also provides an added insurance against adverse external shocks.
Nonetheless, to the extent that external shocks spill over to Poland, the flexible exchange
rate should be the main line of defense, while taking into consideration the impact on
household balance sheets with exposure to foreign-currency denominated debt. Fiscal
automatic stabilizers should be allowed to fully operate along the medium-term
consolidation path. In the event of significant capital outflows, Narodowy Bank Polski (NBP)
should stand ready to provide both zloty and FX liquidity to the banking sector as needed.

Domestic. Focus should remain on maintaining economic and financial stability, including by
refraining from introducing destabilizing policies. Identifying growth-friendly measures to
support a credible medium-term fiscal consolidation plan would help support market
confidence. The authorities should stand ready to cut policy interest rates if inflation
expectations disappoint on the downside.

Authorities’ views
13.
The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s assessment of external risks, with the
Ministry of Finance (MoF) being more optimistic on the domestic outlook. The authorities
concurred that growth would be primarily domestic-demand driven, with an impulse to private
consumption from the child benefits program in the short run. However, the MoF was more
optimistic on the growth outlook, forecasting growth to remain at around 4 percent over the
medium term. On domestic risks, the MoF stressed the government’s commitment to keep the
deficit below 3 percent this year and next and resume fiscal consolidation from 2018. On financial
sector risks, the NBP and the Polish Financial Supervision Authority (KNF) agreed with staff that
blanket conversion of foreign currency mortgages as proposed by the President’s office in
January could pose risks to financial stability. With respect to external risks, the authorities
recognized the importance of continued efforts to maintain sound policies and institutions
together with strong fundamentals to mitigate adverse impact from external shocks. They noted
that Poland is well equipped to manage capital flows by maintaining adequate reserves, a stable
investor base, and a flexible exchange rate, supported by the FCL arrangement with the IMF.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
14.
This year’s consultation focused on policies and institutions to support sustainable
and balanced growth. In this regard, safeguarding strong institutions, fiscal sustainability, and
financial sector stability, underpinned by market-friendly policies, is a prerequisite for continued
stable growth (Box 2). Further advancing structural reforms will be key to securing healthy
potential growth and income convergence, while reducing regional disparities. In the short run,
with a closed output gap but continued low inflation, the near-term policy mix should be
carefully calibrated to maintain an accommodative monetary policy stance, while continuing
gradual fiscal consolidation.

A. Guiding Inflation Back to Target
15.
The policy interest rate has been kept unchanged during the past year. Since the
March 2015 policy interest rate cut (to 1.5 percent—a historical low for Poland), and until the oil
price decline in late 2015, inflation had developed broadly in line with staff’s projections. While
weak headline inflation has kept real policy rates above those in some peer countries (Figure 16),
Monetary Policy Council (MPC) members have resisted further rate cuts, arguing that low
inflation is driven by external factors and pointing to the continued steady expansion in domestic
demand. Alongside, nominal wages and credit growth have generally held up well (at 4½ percent
and 6½ percent in April, respectively). Eight of the ten MPC members, whose terms expired, were
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

REPUBLIC OF POLAND

replaced in January and February and the term of the NBP’s governor expires in mid-June. Based
on recent public statements, expectations are for policy continuity.
16.
Monetary policy should remain accommodative. Inflation is very low but should start
trending upwards as credit and wages continue to expand, fiscal policy turns expansionary, and
the output gap turns positive. Encouragingly, longer-term headline inflation expectations remain
within the tolerance band. Monetary policy should thus remain data-dependent, maintaining
policy rates on hold for now, but the authorities should be prepared to cut rates if inflation
expectations were to fall or if growth slows down sharply. In the meantime, sectoral balance
sheets appear relatively robust to a prolonged spell of externally-driven low inflation (Figure 9).5
Box 2. Poland: Implementation of Past Fund Advice
Policy implementation has generally been in line with past Fund recommendations, though some new
policies are inconsistent with staff advice.
Monetary policy. In line with staff recommendations, the Monetary Policy Council has kept the policy
interest rate at its historic low of 1.5 percent since March 2015 to counter risks of a prolonged period of low
inflation. Moderate buildup of international reserves has continued.
Fiscal policy. Fiscal consolidation has advanced further, supported by a sustained economic recovery,
savings in government consumption and recent changes to the pension system. The authorities have stated
their commitment to a Medium-Term Objective (MTO) of 1 percent of GDP structural deficit, which is
deemed adequate to rebuild fiscal buffers and preserve fiscal sustainability. However, some recent policy
measures are of poor quality: the 2016 budget will be financed partly with one-off fiscal measures and the
expenditure rule was modified to accommodate this. Additionally, a distortionary bank tax has been
implemented. In addition, a reversal of the 2013 retirement age increases is being considered against Fund
advice. Finally, the authorities’ fiscal plans risk turning the 2017 fiscal stance procyclical, against staff advice.
Financial sector policy. The macroprudential framework has been finalized and restructuring of the small
non-systemic credit union segment has continued through takeovers and bankruptcy. Despite staff
recommendation of case-by-case restructuring of distressed foreign-currency mortgages, work has
continued to design a conversion scheme for these mortgages into zloty. The bank resolution framework is
nearing completion but is still awaiting the president’s signature.
Structural reforms. The authorities continued to strengthen labor and product markets, in line with Fund
advice. Measures have been taken to reduce labor market segmentation by better aligning social security
contributions on civil law employment contracts with those on regular contracts and limiting the duration of
consecutive short-term contracts. The business climate has been improved by easing regulations for
business start-ups and amending the tax code to interpret legal doubts in favor of taxpayers. A new
corporate insolvency regime to encourage restructuring (instead of liquidation) of viable firms took effect
from January 1, 2016.

Authorities’ views
17.
The authorities shared staff’s view of continued accommodative monetary policy.
While inflation remains very low, the authorities noted that imported deflation had supported
consumers’ purchasing power and so far has not had negative implications for the real economy,
while balance sheets remained healthy. In turn, they argued for maintaining policy interest rates
on hold in the absence of any sharp changes to growth or inflation expectations, in line with
staff’s view.

B. Ensuring Growth-friendly Fiscal Consolidation
18.
Fiscal consolidation continued in 2015. The general government deficit narrowed to
2.6 percent (a cyclical primary adjustment of 0.3 percent of GDP), benefitting from a sustained
economic recovery, lower government consumption of goods and services, and an increase in
social contributions. Public debt increased modestly to 51.3 percent of GDP at end-2015.
19.
However, as the output gap closed in 2016, the fiscal stance has become
procyclical. Staff estimates that implementation of election promises will increase the deficit to
2.8 percent of GDP in 2016 (a cyclical primary relaxation of 0.2 percent of GDP). Specifically, the
government’s new child benefits program, beginning in April 2016, is expected to cost about
1 percent of GDP annually, financed in part by a tax on bank assets and a retail tax (¼ percent of
GDP)6 and one-off mobile frequencies auction revenues (0.4 percent of GDP).
20.
The authorities’ Convergence Program update envisages an increase in the fiscal
deficit to just under 3 percent in 2017, with subsequent consolidation to 1.3 percent of
GDP by 2019 (Text-Table 2). This is largely based on the assumption that, on the back of strong
nominal GDP growth, revenue will outpace moderate increases in social benefits and wages and
salaries, which authorities intend to keep constant in real terms. The program also assumes
sizable revenue gains from tax administration improvements, estimated at 0.3 percent of GDP by
2017 and increasing to 1 percent of GDP by 2019.
21.
In staff’s view, on unchanged policies, the 2017 fiscal deficit will increase to
3.1 percent of GDP, postponing the fiscal consolidation further and adding to demand at a
time when growth is above potential. Moreover, there are additional risks to the 2017 fiscal
stance that are not included in staff’s baseline. In particular, in addition to already announced
measures, the government intends to reverse the 2013 retirement age increases, which could
cost an additional 0.5 percent of GDP per year, and to increase the Constitutional Courtmandated personal income tax (PIT) tax-free allowance, which if introduced gradually could
initially cost 0.2 percent of GDP per year, increasing to 0.5 percent of GDP by 2019. Without

A tax on assets of credit institutions, lending companies, and insurance undertakings took effect on February 1,
2016. The tax on banks will be levied on the total value of assets (less PLN 4 billion, own funds, and purchased
sovereign debt) at a monthly rate of 0.0366 percent. State-owned banks (relevant for BGK with legal status of
state enterprise) and banks under recovery proceedings, in receivership, in liquidation, or those who filed for
bankruptcy are excluded from the tax (NBP, Financial Stability Report, February, 2016). A retail tax is still under
discussion.

22.
Over the medium term, staff projects a less ambitious deficit reduction on current
policies. Assuming a more conservative budgeting of tax administration gains, less optimistic
growth assumptions, and a higher wage bill to reflect continuing upward pressure from
accelerating private sector wages and the absence of specific measures to maintain public sector
wages constant in real terms, staff projects that the deficit would decline to 2.3 percent of GDP
by 2020, 1.3 percentage points of GDP above the government’s medium-term objective (MTO) of
1 percent of GDP structural deficit. General government debt is projected to increase until 2018,
then decline over subsequent years (Annex II).
23.
Fiscal policy should take advantage of strong growth to resume consolidation
already in 2017. The government’s MTO of 1 percent of GDP structural deficit remains an
appropriate fiscal anchor—allowing for sufficient buffers in the event external risks materialize,
while also creating fiscal space to address looming demographic challenges. Relative to 2017,
measures of around 2 percent of GDP would be required to reach this objective. Taking
advantage of favorable economic conditions, consolidation starting in 2017 at an annual pace of
around 0.5 percent of GDP would reach the MTO by 2020 (Text-Table 3). The deficit reduction
should be underpinned by credible growth-friendly measures to help support market confidence
and maintain budget financing on favorable terms.



Staff noted that measures underlying the 2016 budget are of poor quality and pose
risks to the 2017 fiscal outcome. The 2016 budget is partly financed through one-off
revenues and distortionary sectoral taxes, which should be gradually replaced with higherquality and growth-friendly measures to avoid adverse effects on trade and credit expansion.
For 2017, to keep the deficit below 3 percent, specific measures should be identified. Staff
recommended maintaining the 2011 VAT increase, scheduled to expire in 2017, and
rationalizing discretionary government consumption (which is sizable at around 6 percent of
GDP) through the ongoing expenditure review.



To support the medium-term consolidation, staff recommended a menu of possible
measures: (i) closing ⅓ of the VAT policy gap by reducing preferential rates and exemptions;
(ii) closing ½ of the efficiency gap in health spending, including by shifting towards
ambulatory and primary care;7 (iii) gradually closing ⅓ of the VAT compliance gap through
tax administration improvements; and (iv) gradually phasing out preferential pension regimes
of miners and farmers (Text-Table 4). In this respect, staff welcomed the authorities’ efforts to
strengthen tax administration, but cautioned that any revenue gains should be budgeted
conservatively, particularly in the short run. Until higher revenues materialize, the 2011 VAT
increase should be maintained.



Staff urged the authorities to reconsider the proposed reduction in the retirement age.
Reversing the gradual increase in the retirement age, to 67 for both men and women (by
2020 and 2040, respectively, from 65 and 60 in 2013), as currently intended, could further
reduce the pension replacement rate, increasing the risk of old-age poverty and potentially
further weakening public finances, thus undermining the social and financial sustainability of
the pension system (Box 3). Moreover, it would reduce labor force participation at a time
when potential growth is already being threatened by unfavorable demographic trends.

Authorities’ views
24.
The authorities underscored their commitment to keep the deficit below 3 percent
of GDP in 2017 and to resume consolidation in 2018 to put public debt on a firm
downward path. They indicated that no new spending measures would be implemented
without first identifying financing through revenue measures or expenditure cuts. In this context,

REPUBLIC OF POLAND

they would consider maintaining the 2011 VAT increase, scheduled to expire in 2017. They noted
that the large share of discretionary government consumption in the budget affords flexibility to
cut expenditure over time. They specified a number of initiatives to improve tax administration,
including by introducing a clause against tax avoidance (General Anti-Avoidance Rule), reducing
the limit on cash transactions between companies, and introducing an integrated IT system to
track VAT invoices. They indicated that increasing the PIT tax-free allowance could be introduced
as part of a more comprehensive income tax reform, with lost revenues from the higher
allowance offset by a more progressive tax regime. The authorities were more optimistic on the
timing and magnitude of expected revenue gains from tax administration improvements, as well
as on the medium-term macroeconomic assumptions underlying their fiscal projections. They
concurred that the proposed reduction in the retirement age could reduce the pension
replacement rate, but noted that adjusting parametric conditions for entitlement to retirement
would mitigate this impact.

Box 3. Poland: Fiscal Implications of Demographic Changes1
Poland’s population is expected to decline and age
dramatically over the next 45 years. According to
Eurostat projections, the population is expected to
decline by 30 percent between 2015 and 2060
following a sharp drop in fertility rates. The old-age
dependency ratio is expected to almost triple.
Under unchanged policies and given expected
demographic trends, average pension replacement
rates would need to decline significantly in the long
term to sustain the solvency of the defined
contribution pension system. According to the
European Commission, average replacement rates2 in
Poland are projected to decline by about 25
percentage points to below 30 percent by 2060,
despite pension reforms implemented in 2013 to
gradually increase the retirement age for both men
and women to 67 from 65 and 60, respectively. The
projected average replacement rate will be one of the
lowest in the EU, increasing the risk of old-age poverty.

replacement rate is maintained at 40 percent—the minimum recommended by the International Labor
Organization—pension expenditure would increase by about 4½ percent of GDP per year by 2060.

Reversing the gradual increase in the retirement age could exacerbate the social and fiscal impact of
population aging. The replacement rate could drop even further to less than 25 percent.3 Maintaining the

expenditure by about 6½ percent of GDP per year by 2060.

still high in some segments (Figures 17 and 18) despite strong growth and falling
unemployment. Credit standards on loans have remained broadly unchanged in recent quarters,
with the exception of housing loans, where standards tightened on the back of new prudential
recommendations and reduced appetite among some banks for expanding the housing loan
portfolio.
26.
However, new policies could significantly worsen financial sector conditions. While
the NBP has recently noted the banking sector’s continued stability, it has stressed that the
sector’s resilience to shocks has weakened substantially on the back of new fiscal measures
imposed on banks.8


Bank tax. According to the NBP, the bank
tax, combined with regulatory costs, could
increase the share of banks with negative
net earnings from 2 to 22 percent of
banking sector assets and reduce net
earnings of the commercial banking
sector by 60 percent. This in turn could
slow credit expansion and have adverse
macro-financial implications (Box 4).

Box 4. Poland: Macro-Financial Implications of the Bank Tax1
In February 2016, Poland introduced a new tax on bank assets. Staff analysis suggests that the tax will likely
significantly reduce bank profits with negative implications for credit and economic growth. However, the
negative economic effects of the tax can be mitigated through better design.
The bank tax can significantly reduce bank profits,
slowing down credit and economic growth. The tax is
levied on total assets (less PLN 4 billion, own funds, and
purchased sovereign debt) at a monthly rate of
0.0366 percent. In turn, 2016 tax outlays paid by banks
could double relative to 2015. Empirical analysis suggests
that the tax, combined with recent regulatory costs on
banks (including increased contributions to the BFG and
contributions to finance the Borrower Support Fund,
could reduce bank profitability by 30 percent relative to
2015. In turn, this would reduce credit growth by 3 to 4
percentage points relative to a no-tax scenario. Lower
credit growth would reduce consumption and investment
and ultimately lower GDP growth by up to 0.4 percentage
points by end-2016.

shift away from corporate to more risky consumer lending,
where spreads are higher, or shift lending activities to
less-regulated non-banks. In turn, corporates may be able to obtain loans from other segments such as
leasing companies. Also, incentives to limit the size of assets at the end of the month when the tax is levied
could unduly constrain short-term liquidity in the interbank market.
The negative economic effects of the bank asset tax could be mitigated through better design. To the
extent that a tax on banks is desired to raise revenue, a Financial Activities Tax (FAT) would be less
distortionary for the private sector and the economy in general than a tax on assets (IMF, 2010). Denmark,
Iceland, and Israel, for example, have imposed a FAT.2 A FAT, levied on the sum of profits and remuneration
of financial institutions, is similar to a value added tax (VAT) from which the financial sector is currently
exempt. Unlike the current bank asset tax, a FAT does not distort the structure of the activities undertaken
by financial institutions themselves, as the tax depends on



Foreign-currency (FX) mortgages. Although virtually no new FX lending is taking place
following stronger prudential measures by the KNF, the outstanding stock of FX mortgages
accounted for about 9¼ percent of 2015 GDP at end-March 2016. Against concerns that
some of these loans were extended without adequate consumer information, a framework
was proposed in January for the blanket conversion of these mortgages into zloty,
irrespective of borrowers’ income conditions and payment capacity. Following KNF’s
assessment that it could cost the banking sector PLN 67 billion (3.7 percent of 2015 GDP)—
close to six times the value of 2015 banking sector profits—and result in several bank
bankruptcies and associated fiscal costs from deposit guarantees, a new proposal is being
developed by the President’s office. At this point, several alternative options for addressing
FX mortgages are being discussed, and their total cost remains unclear.



Credit unions and cooperative banks. The restructuring of the non-systemic credit union
sector (with assets corresponding to less than 1 percent of banking sector assets) has
continued. Bankruptcy of a cooperative bank in the fall of 2015 added costs to banks of
PLN 2 billion.

27.
Staff stressed the importance of safeguarding financial sector stability. As banks are
operating in an environment of reduced interest margins, lower profits, and a distortionary tax
on bank assets, lending activity could shift toward lending segments with higher profit margins,
such as consumer loans, or shift into the less-regulated non-bank sector. In that respect, recent
regulation on non-bank lending companies, which should help prevent the buildup of new
vulnerabilities, is welcome (see ¶28). Nonetheless, newly introduced financial sector measures, as
well as other costs on banks,9 could significantly lower profits and weaken credit expansion and
economic growth, with repercussions for fiscal consolidation. Potential bank failures could also
feed back into the public sector balance sheet. In this regard, the impact of any new measures—
particularly FX conversion and its interaction with other financial measures—on the health of the
financial sector and the economy more broadly should be carefully thought through and the
introduction of any destabilizing measures should be avoided.


Bank tax. As currently designed, the tax could negatively affect lending and financial
intermediation. Instead, a financial activities tax on profits and remuneration (proxying VAT
from which the financial sector is exempt), would be less distortionary.



Foreign-currency mortgages. Since foreign-currency mortgages are not of systemic
macroeconomic or financial stability concern, blanket conversion schemes should be
avoided. Instead, the focus should be on case-by-case restructuring, taking into account the
level of debtor distress and payment ability. Furthermore, the new temporary payment relief
scheme for zloty and FX mortgages should be allowed time to work before considering any

9

other measures to assist FX mortgage holders.10 Recent amendments to the consumer
protection law, which took effect as of April 2016, should also help prevent misselling of
financial products by banks going forward. Prudential measures related to new FX loans
should continue restricting FX loans to individuals with adequate earnings in the
corresponding currency.


Credit unions and cooperative banks. Staff encouraged the authorities to continue
restructuring of the credit union segment. In light of costs associated with the recent
bankruptcy of a cooperative bank, the new bank resolution framework should be
implemented expeditiously to ensure the availability of state-of-the-art resolution tools.

28.
A strengthened financial sector framework now in place should mitigate risks going
forward. The authorities have completed a macroprudential framework, which allows for early
detection and prevention of systemic risk, and a law on covered bonds, which over time should
help support stable funding. The new bank resolution framework, in accordance with the
European Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD), is progressing. Finally, recent
regulation on non-banks limited non-interest costs of loans and constrained the practice of
rolling over credit to prevent escalating debts, in particular related to consumer lending.
Authorities’ views
29.
While the NBP shared many of staff’s concerns, the MoF was more optimistic
concerning foreign-currency mortgage conversion and the effects of the bank tax. The
authorities generally agreed that the bank tax has squeezed liquidity in some parts of the
banking sector toward the end of the month and has incentivized banks to hold more
government bonds. However, they noted that a notable shift toward more risky lending had so
far not been observed. In addition, the MoF highlighted their intentions to evaluate the
performance of the bank tax and adjust it if deemed necessary. While the NBP acknowledged
that a costly blanket foreign-currency mortgage conversion scheme could be potentially
destabilizing, the President’s office assured staff that it is aware of these risks and that any
solution would thus aim to preserve financial stability. At the same time, it noted its commitment
to help foreign-currency mortgage holders in difficult situations. The MoF highlighted the recent
consultative process with multiple agencies and stakeholders that contributed to the decision to
revisit the design of the proposed conversion scheme to ensure that any future proposal
safeguards financial stability.

D. Promoting Inclusive Growth Through Structural Reforms

Recent structural reforms have focused on reducing duality in the labor market and
improving the business climate. Temporary job contracts—which carry little employment
protection and have discouraged investment in on-the-job training—have been better aligned

To reduce vulnerabilities associated with FX mortgages, banks with significant FX exposure have been
requested to retain dividends and further boost capital. A temporary payment relief program for distressed zloty

with regular contracts, including by shortening their maximum duration and increasing their
social security contributions. This should help reduce labor market segmentation and improve
sustainability of the pension system, while retaining sufficient labor market flexibility. Most
recently, the Association of Employment Agencies reported a substantial reduction in the
attractiveness of civil law contracts in favor of regular contracts. The government has also
adopted a draft law introducing an hourly minimum wage for these contracts starting next year.
The business climate has been improved via the introduction of a corporate insolvency law,
designed to promote restructuring (instead of liquidation) of viable firms. Alongside, businesses
should benefit from a number of tax-related changes, such as changes to the tax code in favor of
the taxpayer in case of legal uncertainties and tax assistance to support start-ups in tax-related
matters.
31.
Going forward, structural reforms should focus on reducing regional disparities and
addressing looming demographic challenges to ensure inclusive and sustainable growth.

Promoting regional growth. Staff welcomed recent efforts to improve the labor market and
the business environment. However, to reduce regional disparities, policies would need to
address productivity gaps in the east (Box 5). This would require improving educational
attainment in the east and reducing skill mismatches by better aligning education curricula
with employers’ needs, and investing in infrastructure to attract FDI to poorer regions. In this
respect, the authorities’ intention to address these issues as signaled in the Responsible
Development Plan is welcome. Phasing out special tax and pension regimes for farmers
would facilitate mobility from agriculture to higher-productivity sectors, while also
encouraging scaling-up of farms in the east and boosting productivity in agriculture.

further advancing plans to increase access to pre-school facilities would be beneficial.
Maintaining the retirement age increase envisaged by the 2013 pension reforms would
safeguard participation of seniors.
Box 5. Poland: Regional Disparities1
Although Poland has enjoyed strong growth and steady income convergence with the EU over the
last two decades, important disparities persist at the regional level. Per-capita income is higher in the
west—which is integrated into the German supply chain and enjoys higher levels of FDI—than in the east—
where the economy is more reliant on less productive agriculture. Despite strong overall growth, the east
has not been catching up to the west.
Reducing regional disparities by boosting economic performance in lagging regions would promote
faster and more inclusive growth. Estimates suggest that Poland’s GDP per capita could be increased by
7 percent if one-third of the gap between regions with GDP per capita below average and the four regions,
which are above average, was closed. This would imply an additional 5 percentage point convergence to the
EU28 average income level. Boosting labor productivity growth in lagging regions is key to reducing
regional disparities. There is a strong association between income per capita and labor productivity levels:
wealthier regions in Poland also tend to have higher levels of productivity.
Policies to boost regional productivity convergence would require supporting structural
transformation in the east, facilitating labor mobility, and attracting FDI to less productive regions.

Structural transformation. Productivity growth in the east
can be supported by reallocating labor from low-productivity
agriculture to higher-productivity industry and service sectors.
The subsidized pension scheme for farmers should be gradually
phased out to discourage inefficient farming motivated by
pension arbitrage. Moving from the current tax system based on
farm size and quality of land to an income-based tax would
encourage scaling up of farms, increasing their capital intensity
and productivity.

Labor mobility. Active labor market policies to improve
job searching efficiency across regions combined with policies to
reduce skill mismatches—including by better aligning education
and training curricular with employer needs—would facilitate
labor mobility across sectors and regions, and help lower high
structural unemployment in the east.


FDI. Investor surveys suggest that access to skilled labor

this regard.

Box 6. Poland: Female Labor Force Participation1
Poland is facing a rapidly aging population. With the working-age population expected to shrink by more
than 30 percent by 2060, the old-age dependency ratio will increase dramatically. While there are about 20
people aged 65+ for every one hundred persons of working age today, by 2060, this number is expected to
increase to about 60 people, with adverse implications for social spending and growth.

Policies to level the playing field between men and women can have significant impact. While
individual characteristics, attitudes, and personal choice are important drivers of female labor force
participation, certain policies may also impact women’s employment decisions. 2 For example, joint taxation,
as is the case in Poland, would tend to have higher marginal tax rates on the second earner in a family—
usually a woman—and create disincentives to work outside the home. Further, the availability of high-quality
childcare facilitates working outside the home, while family cash allowances tend to discourage women from
joining the workforce.
There is room to adjust policies in Poland to increase
female labor force participation. For example,
redirecting resources from family cash-transfers toward
pre-school education would make it easier for women to
combine family responsibilities with work outside the
home. This could also help boost fertility, which is among
the lowest in Europe. In contrast, the proposed lowering of
the statutory retirement age would be a step in the wrong
direction, as it would reduce labor force participation of
women among the older age groups, further exacerbating
the adverse economic effects of aging.

Authorities’ views
32.
The authorities stressed that addressing structural challenges is a vital part of their
reform agenda. They noted that the Responsible Development Plan approved by the
government earlier this year identifies barriers to growth, including the need to counteract
adverse demographic trends and to promote inclusive regional growth. It also envisages
promoting innovation to facilitate moving up the value added chain and further improving the
business environment and the quality of public services. In this respect, EU funds are an
important financing source, with the authorities envisaging increasing involvement of the private
sector to ensure that the funds are invested in viable projects. It was also noted that the new
child benefits program (Family 500+) is expected to increase fertility to counteract negative
demographic prospects. In addition, it would reduce income inequality and child poverty and
could help cover some of the cost of childcare, thereby having positive effects on female labor
force participation. The authorities voiced their commitment to continue increasing access to
childcare facilities.

STAFF APPRAISAL
33.
Poland is enjoying a strong economic expansion. Growth reached 3.6 percent in 2015
driven by robust domestic demand, supported by healthy wage and credit expansion.
Unemployment has come down rapidly and the economy is operating at full capacity. External
factors have kept headline inflation significantly below the target but these are expected to
dissipate over time. Despite some weakening in the first quarter, growth is projected to remain
strong, opening a positive output gap next year. In turn, inflation should gradually strengthen
and enter the target band by end-2017.
34.
Downside risks to the outlook have intensified. External risks include a marked
slowdown in emerging markets, accompanied by financial market volatility, and a protracted
growth slowdown in the euro area, which could spill over to Poland through trade and financial
linkages. Domestically, some recent policy initiatives raise concerns about their negative impact
on growth prospects. Specifically, a weakening of institutions and policies or fiscal slippages
could worsen investor sentiment and hinder economic expansion. Over the longer term, a rapidly
aging population poses important challenges to potential growth and fiscal sustainability. At the
same time, enduring income disparities between Poland’s prosperous west and the lagging east
could undermine the quality of growth.
35.
Strong policies and institutions are critical to mitigate these risks and to support
sustainable and balanced growth. Considering the favorable cyclical position alongside weak
inflation, continued monetary accommodation should go hand-in-hand with gradual fiscal
consolidation. At the same time, safeguarding financial sector stability and strong institutions is
essential for continued strong and stable growth. Structural reforms are key to sustainable
convergence to western European income levels. The FCL arrangement with the IMF provides
added insurance against external shocks.

34

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF POLAND

36.
The current accommodative monetary policy stance is appropriate. Although the
recent period of deflation does not appear to have had adverse spillovers to the real economy,
getting inflation back to the target is important to ensure that inflation expectations do not
become unanchored. Hence, further interest rate cuts should be considered in the event of a
sharp growth slowdown or if inflation expectations were to disappoint.
37.
Gradual fiscal consolidation should resume next year. The implementation of election
promises has turned the fiscal stance procyclical, potentially pushing the deficit above 3 percent
of GDP in 2017. However, as the output gap is expected to turn positive next year, staff
recommends taking advantage of the favorable cyclical position and resuming deficit reduction
in 2017 underpinned by credible growth-friendly measures. This would also help support market
confidence and maintain budget financing on favorable terms. Measures could include
rationalizing discretionary government consumption and unifying multiple VAT rates. The
distortionary tax on bank assets should be replaced with a more growth-friendly tax on bank
profits and remuneration to avoid adverse effects on credit and growth. Amid adverse
demographic trends, the planned reversal of the 2013 retirement age increases is ill-advised and
should be reconsidered. Such a step would reduce the pension replacement rate, increasing the
risk of old-age poverty and adversely impacting the budget.
38.
Maintaining financial sector stability is essential. While banking sector capital ratios
are healthy, narrowing interest margins have reduced profitability. Going forward, the bank tax
may further reduce profits, potentially spilling over to the real economy through reduced credit
expansion. While the outstanding stock of foreign-currency mortgages poses a vulnerability,
blanket conversion schemes should be avoided as they risk undermining financial stability, with
adverse implications for economic activity. Instead, focus should be on supporting distressed
mortgage holders on a case-by-case basis. A prompt completion of the bank resolution
framework would ensure the availability of modern resolution tools.
39.
Structural reforms should focus on addressing demographic challenges and
reducing regional disparities. Aging-related pressures can be alleviated by increasing labor
force participation, particularly of women and seniors, and boosting productivity. In this respect,
the authorities’ intention to move up the value-added chain by increasing access to vocational
training and promoting innovation is welcome. Redirecting family cash benefits toward childcare
and preschool education would help boost female labor force participation. Maintaining the
retirement age increases envisaged by the 2013 pension reforms would encourage participation
of seniors. Reducing regional disparities would promote a more inclusive growth and speed up
convergence. This would require improving educational attainment in the east, reducing skill
mismatches, and investing in infrastructure to attract FDI to poorer regions.
40.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12month cycle.

Table 7. Poland: 2013 FSAP Recommendations and Current Status1
Key Recommendations

Status

Addressing impaired loans: (i)
intensify oversight of credit risk
management and restructuring
practices; (ii) standardize and enhance
transparency of bank accounting
practices; and (iii) standardize debt-toincome (DTI) ratio calculation.

The Polish Financial Supervision Authority (KNF) continued
oversight of credit risk management and restructuring
practices, including by following up on individual
recommendations issued after cross-sector inspections of
impairment charges in 2013 and the Asset Quality Review
(AQR) in 2014. All 15 banks included in the AQR were
requested to provide information on the quantitative impact of
the implementation of recommendations on impairment
charges. KNF found that the AQR, through recommendations
to banks, had a significant measurable impact on the level of
impairment losses in banks.

Strengthening banking supervision:
(i) expand the scope for the Polish
Financial Supervision Authority (KNF) to
issue legally binding prudential
regulations; (ii) allow KNF's Board to
delegate administrative and procedural
decisions to its management, increase
KNF independence, and address other
governance issues; and (iii) increase
KNF flexibility to allocate budgetary and
staff resources and enhance its
analytical capabilities.

In line with the stipulations of the Polish constitution, KNF
cannot issue legally binding, general acts (regulations).
However, KNF can issue recommendations to banks regarding
risk management, specifying how banks should mitigate risk.

Strengthening credit unions: (i)
eliminate the dual supervision; require a
solvency ratio of 8 percent in 5 years;
and clarify the governance of the
stabilization fund; (ii) develop an
inclusive set of SKOK regulations and
apply accounting principles for financial
institutions to SKOKs; and (iii) develop
capital rehabilitation plans for
financially weak SKOKs.

The dual supervision problem has been solved and presently
KNF is the only supervisor of the credit union sector. KNF has
continued work to address vulnerabilities, with 33 of 42 credit
unions obliged to prepare capital rehabilitation plans.
Restructuring has also involved bankruptcy and take-overs by
banks. The draft law on the bank resolution framework is
awaiting the president’s signature. The draft law covers credit
unions. Applying accounting principles for financial institutions
to SKOKs has been an ongoing process. The current version of
the regulation came into force on January 1, 2015.

Developing sound macroprudential
policies: (i) ensure the macroprudential
supervisory law provides for Systemic
Risk Board’s (SRB's) independence (with
a leading role for Narodowy Bank Polski
(NBP)), accountability to Parliament,
and power to make recommendations
coupled with an "act or explain"
mechanism; and (ii) develop clear
macroprudential policy objectives that
are distinct from those of monetary and
microprudential supervisory policy.

The Act on macroprudential supervision over the financial
system and crisis management took effect on November 1,
2015 (some provisions came into force later). It designated the
Financial Stability Committee (FSC) as the macroprudential
authority in Poland. The FSC consists of 4 members: the
Governor of the NBP, the Minister of Finance; the Chairperson
of KNF; and the President of the Board of the Bank Guarantee
Fund (BFG). The FSC is chaired by the Governor of the NBP in
the area of macro-prudential supervision. The FSC has soft
powers. Hence, it may issue recommendations backed by the
“comply or explain” mechanism and statements highlighting
potential sources of systemic risk. The FSC does not have

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF POLAND

Table 7. Poland: 2013 FSAP Recommendations and Current Status (concluded)
Key Recommendations

Status
power to implement macroprudential tools, which may be
implemented by FSC member institutions (the Ministry of
Finance and KNF). Accountability is ensured as the Chair is
obliged to present an annual report to Parliament. The Act sets
a clear macroprudential policy objective, which is to strengthen
the resilience of the financial system in case systemic risk
materializes, thereby supporting long-term sustainable
economic growth.

Improving the bank resolution
framework: (i) ensure precedence of
administrative powers over corporate
insolvency procedures; (ii) ensure that
the creditor claims hierarchy protects
BFG's claims on resources provided for
balance sheet "gap filling" measures;
and (iii) include a Tier-1 capital trigger
and link the "public interest" trigger to
financial stability.

The draft law is progressing. On May 20, 2016, it was adopted
by the Sejm (Lower Chamber). On June 10, it was adopted by
the parliament and is currently awaiting the president’s
signature. The draft law covers issues (i), (ii), and (iii) as
indicated by FSAP recommendations.

Improving the deposit insurance
system: (i) remove the Polish Bank
Association (PBA) from the BFG Council;
(ii) ensure adequate funding and
capacity, revise and introduce new
regulations, and enhance protocols in
light of expanded mandate; and (iii)
amend code of conduct to restrict
employment in member institutions to
all employees.

The draft law on the BFG is progressing. On May 20, 2016, it
was adopted by the Sejm. On June 10, it was adopted by the
parliament and is currently awaiting the president’s signature.
The draft law removes PBA from the BFG Council. BFG is
continuing to expand and strengthen their staff in accordance
with their new tasks. In addition, the proposed target levels of
BFG funds are above those established in the Deposit
Guarantee Scheme Directive (DGSD) and Bank Recovery and
Resolution Directive (BRRD).

Strengthening pension reform and
capital markets: (i) allow lifecycle
strategies in pension funds, and
measure performance of pension funds
in relation to the benchmark portfolio;
(ii) amend the mortgage covered bond
framework to allow broader issuance
and adopt a legal framework for
mortgage securitization; (iii) strengthen
enforcement of security interests and
judicial decisions.

Pension funds do not offer lifecycle strategies. However, in
order to protect pension fund assets in the last period of
saving before retirement, assets will be transferred gradually to
the Social Security Fund, starting 10 years before reaching
retirement age. The performance of pension funds is measured
relative to an external benchmark.
The Act amending the Act on covered bonds and mortgage
banks was adopted by Parliament in July 2015. The entry into
force of this law on January 1, 2016 removed the main barriers
to the development of the covered bond market. The Act of
November 8, 2013, amending the Act on Corporate Income
Tax, introduced changes (effective of January 1, 2014) in
taxation rules aimed at improving the economic effectiveness
of securitization by changing the moment banks recognize
revenue from the sale of rights to payments from bank
receivables securitized through sub-participation.

Poland: External Debt Sustainability Framework, 2013–21

REPUBLIC OF POLAND

Annex II. Public Sector Debt Sustainability Analysis
Public debt was moderately high at 51.3 percent of GDP at the end of 2015, but sustainable. The
profile of public debt appears robust to interest, rollover, and foreign currency risks. The main risk
to the debt outlook stems from a negative shock to GDP growth. In addition, a large share of
foreign investors in the domestic debt market entails a risk, although composition of the investor
base is a mitigating factor.

A. Baseline and Realism of Projections
Debt levels. Debt is projected to increase by 1.9 percentage points of GDP between 2015 and
2018, before declining by 1.6 percentage points of GDP to 51.6 percent of GDP by 2021. Debt
dynamics are driven by the primary deficit, which initially increases before taking a declining path
in 2018. A favorable differential between projected GDP growth and the real interest rate also
contributes to a decrease in debt levels.
GDP growth. The projections assume an acceleration of growth to 3.7 percent by 2017 with
increasing private consumption, and a subsequent slowdown to 3.1 percent as output trends
back toward potential. The output gap is expected to close this year. In recent years, staff
projections of growth have displayed small forecast errors, with some indication of a pessimistic
bias relative to other countries.
Fiscal adjustment. Under the baseline, the primary deficit is expected to increase to 1.4 percent
of GDP by 2017, before declining to 0.4 percent of GDP by 2021. The dynamics reflect the
government’s expansionary fiscal stance in 2017, and thereafter nominal GDP growth that
outpaces government consumption and increases in social security benefits over the medium
term. In the recent past, staff forecast errors of the primary deficit in Poland have not displayed
an apparent bias and have been more conservative than for other countries. Overall, the
projected fiscal adjustment seems feasible, as indicated by cross country benchmarks.
Sovereign yields. The effective interest rate on public debt declined from 6.6 percent in 2005 to
5.9 percent in 2009 and further to about 3.7 percent in 2015, reflecting Poland’s strong
fundamentals and favorable global financial conditions. The effective interest rate is projected at
3.5 percent in 2016, and maintains a similar level in the medium term. Yields on 10‒year bonds
have increased by 25 basis points year-to-date to 3.2 percent, and spreads of Polish eurodenominated bonds over 10‒year German bonds have increased to 110 basis points, reflecting
higher market risk. CDS spreads increased by 10 basis points year-to-date to 82 basis points.
Maturity and rollover risks. Rollover risks are well managed. The average maturity of
outstanding debt is 5.4 years, and the share of short-term debt in total government debt is under
1 percent as of May 2016. T-bill issuance resumed in January 2016, following a period since
August 2013 when there were no outstanding t-bills. Currently, 68 percent of gross borrowing
requirements for 2016 have been pre-financed, taking advantage of favorable market conditions.
Treasury securities held by domestic banks, which are exempt from the authorities’ new bank

asset tax, increased by almost 5 percent of GDP over January to March 2016, compared to an
increase of 1.3 percent over the same period in 2015. The share of foreign investors in the
domestic treasury market decreased from 38 percent in January to 35 percent in March 2016. The
overall share of external debt in total public debt was about 57 percent as of Q4 2015. In
addition, the share of foreign currency debt in state debt is about 34 percent as of February
2016. In line with the debt management strategy, the baseline assumes gradual convergence
toward the current structure of public debt in terms of the share of foreign currency debt in total
debt (about 30 percent) and external debt in total debt (about 50 percent).
Debt sustainability analysis (DSA) risk assessment. The heat map highlights risks associated
with the relatively large external financing requirements (about 22 percent of GDP in 2015), and
the share of public debt held by non-residents (about 57 percent at end-2015). The latter is
influenced by the large participation of foreign investors in the domestic bond market. U.S.
investors comprise 25 percent of foreign investors, exposing the bond market to liquidity risks in
case of interest rate hikes in the U.S.
Fan charts. The symmetric fan charts, which assume symmetric upside and downside risks,
indicate that the debt-to-GDP ratio could drop to below 50 percent by 2020 with a 25 percent
probability. On the other hand, the upper bands indicate that debt-to-GDP ratios could surpass
60 percent by 2020 with a 10 percent probability. A more stringent exercise, however, combining
restrictions to the upside shocks to interest rates and GDP growth (200 bps and 1 percent,
respectively), increases the probability of debt-to-GDP surpassing 60 percent in 2020 to
50 percent. This result illustrates the degree of uncertainty around the baseline.

B. Shocks and Stress Tests
Primary balance shock. An assumed deterioration in the primary balance by one percentage
point during 2016 pushes the public debt-to-revenue ratio up to about 140 percent during 2018.
Gross financing needs peak at about 10.4 percent of GDP in 2017 and converge to the baseline
by 2021.
Growth shock. The stress scenario assumes a drop in GDP growth by about 1.8 percentage
points in two consecutive years (2017‒18) relative to the baseline, combined with a
0.5 percentage point drop in inflation and deterioration in the primary balance by 1.4 percent in
2017 and further by 0.6 percent in 2018. Under these assumptions, public debt increases to
about 58.4 percent of GDP in 2018 before trending downward to about 56.7 percent of GDP by
2021. Gross financing needs increase to about 11 percent of GDP during 2017‒18, but then
converge toward the baseline in the outer years.
Interest rate shock. A permanent 250 bps increase in the nominal interest rate starting in 2017
(equivalent to the difference between the maximum real interest rate during 2004‒14 and the
average real interest rate over the projection period), leads to an increase in the effective interest
rate on debt by 45 bps in 2018 (compared to the baseline) and further gradual increases to 148

54

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF POLAND

bps by 2021. Under this scenario, public debt increases by 1.9 percentage points relative to the
baseline by 2021.
Exchange rate shock. This scenario assumes an exchange rate depreciation of about 20 percent
in 2017 (from 3.9 PLN/US$ to 4.7 PLN/US$), calibrated to emulate the maximum historic
movement of the FX rate over the last 10 years. Under this scenario, gross public debt increases
by 1 percentage point to 54 percent of GDP in 2018 before trending down to about 52.3 percent
by 2021. The resilience reflects the predominance of public debt in local currency.
Combined shock. Under the combined shock, the public-debt-to-GDP ratio jumps to
62.2 percent in 2017 and maintains that level until 2021. In turn, gross financing needs increase
to 11.5 percent of GDP in 2017, and trend downwards to around 9 percent of GDP in the outer
years.

Exchange Arrangements:
The zloty is freely floating.
Poland accepted the obligation of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 on June 1, 1995. Poland maintains an
exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international
transactions, except for the exchange restrictions imposed by Poland solely for the preservation of
national or international security as introduced by the European Union (EU) within the framework of the
Common Foreign and Security Policy. The consolidated list of such sanctions is available at:
http://eeas.europa.eu/cfsp/sanctions/consol-list/index_en.htm.
Article IV Consultation:
The last Article IV consultation was concluded on July 10, 2015. In concluding the consultation,
Directors welcomed Poland’s recovery from the 2012–13 slowdown, supported by very strong
economic fundamentals and policies, which paved the way for continued robust growth and further
integration with European and global markets. They added that Poland’s strong policy framework has
increased the economy’s resilience but observed that downside risks to the outlook remain. Directors
noted that the precautionary FCL arrangement continued to provide important temporary insurance
against external risks. On monetary policy, Directors welcomed the March policy interest rate cut, which
should help limit the risk of prolonged low inflation and agreed that there could be a need to ease
monetary policy further if inflation expectations continue to disappoint. Directors recommended
moderate reserve accumulation to strengthen the resilience to shocks. With respect to the financial
sector, Directors commended the continued strong performance of the banking sector and welcomed
the new bankruptcy and insolvency law and encouraged the authorities to expedite implementation of
other key financial sector reforms, including the adoption of comprehensive macroprudential and bank
resolution frameworks. They supported the authorities’ case-by-case approach to restructuring
distressed Swiss franc-denominated mortgages. On fiscal policy, Directors considered that continued
gradual consolidation would create additional policy space to allow for a timely and effective response
to shocks without unduly weighing on growth. In this regard, they agreed that the medium-term
objective of a structural deficit of 1 percent of GDP remained appropriate, and encouraged the
authorities to identify specific expenditure savings and reduce the large VAT revenue gap to ensure that
this objective be met. Directors commended that continued efforts to raise spending efficiency and
reform of the special pension schemes would help address fiscal pressures from population aging.
Directors encouraged the authorities to continue to implement structural reforms to boost productivity,
safeguard competitiveness, and allow the economy to move up the value-added chain, thereby
facilitating income convergence.
Resident Representative:
Mr. Bas Bakker replaced Mr. James Roaf as the Senior Regional Resident Representative for Central and
Eastern Europe, effective August 4, 2015.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Poland—Statistical Issues Appendix
(As of March 2016)
I.

Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance

General: Data provision is adequate for surveillance.
National Accounts: The Central Statistical Office (GUS) compiles and disseminates annual and
quarterly GDP by production and expenditure approaches, both at current and previous year’s prices
following the 2008 SNA and ESA 2010. A supply and use table is only available for the year 2010.
Quarterly financial accounts of general government sector are compiled by the Central Statistical
Office (GUS). Annual and quarterly financial accounts by institutional sectors are compiled by
Narodowy Bank Polski (NBP) following the ESA 2010 standards and disseminated regularly on its
website according to an advance release calendar: the annual financial accounts on the 20th of
October the following year and quarterly financial accounts on the 20th calendar day of the 4th month
following the end of the reference quarter (i.e., on the 20th of January, April, July, and October).
Price Statistics: The consumer price index does not cover imputed rents of owner-occupied dwellings.
The scope of the index covers all resident households, except those in some rural areas. The producer
price index does not include any estimation for missing prices; quality and seasonal adjustment
techniques are also not implemented.
Government Finance Statistics: The Ministry of Finance (MoF) is responsible for compiling monthly
data. The data are compiled in accordance with the IMF's Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001
(GFSM 2001). Monthly cash data cover “core” central government. Revenue and expense are divided
by economic type. Financing is classified by sector and by type of debt instrument.
Starting in 2015 (annual data for 2014), GUS is responsible for collecting, processing, and
disseminating annual government finance statistics. The data are compiled according to European
System of Accounts (ESA2010) and adjusted to GFS Manual 2014. The annual reports cover
presentation of fiscal data on operations of the general government sector divided by central
government, local government, and social security funds. Revenue and expense are divided by
transactions. Financing is classified by sector and by type of debt instrument. General government data
are released on a quarterly basis, derived from detailed ESA data. Monthly and annual data are
regularly disseminated on the SDDS website. Data for 2013 were prepared by the Ministry of Finance
according to GFS2001, while data for 2014 were prepared by the Central Statistical Office according to
GFSM2014.

I.

Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance (concluded)

Monetary and Financial Statistics: Beginning with data for January 2004, the NBP provides the
European Central Bank (ECB) with monetary accounts in accordance with the ECB’s framework for
monetary statistics using the national residency approach. Data on other financial corporations (OFC) are
currently not available. An earlier Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) mission

recommended that the NBP, in cooperation with the MoF, reconcile monetary and government finance
statistics and carry out a reconciliation exercise on a regular basis.
Financial Sector Surveillance: In November 2009, NBP in cooperation with GUS, the Polish Financial
Supervision Authority (KNF) and MoF began reporting financial soundness indicators (FSI) based on
the IMF’s Financial Soundness Indicators Compilation Guide. Poland is currently reporting all core FSIs
and 19 of the 28 encouraged FSIs on a quarterly basis with a lag of approximately one quarter. NBP
also implemented EU regulation 680/2014, which covers supervisory reporting defined by the
Implementing Technical Standards (ITS) prepared by the European Banking Authority. The first data
was collected for March 2014 for own funds and liquidity related reporting. Financial reporting on a
consolidated basis according to the ITS scheme was reported for the first time for September 2014.
External Sector Statistics: Largely to improve data accuracy, the NBP fully depends on survey-based
source data, starting in the first quarter of 2010. STA undertook an evaluation mission to Poland in
July 2009, and followed up in June 2011 to assess further data improvements and anticipated revisions
in the external sector accounts. Due to the comprehensive work on improving the data sources, the
errors and omissions reduced from 4 percent of GDP in 2004 to around 2 percent of GDP in recent
years, which is comparable to the level in other European countries. Authorities are committed to
further improving the compilation system for the external sector statistics.
Poland, as all other EU countries, started disseminating balance of payments data in accordance with
the sixth edition of the IMF’s Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual (BPM6)
and external debt statistics in line with the 2013 External Debt Statistics: Guide for Compilers and Users
(2013 EDS Guide).
Poland reports Coordinated Direct Investment Survey and Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey
data to the IMF.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
June 27, 2016
1.
This statement provides information that has become available since the Staff
Report was circulated to the Executive Board on June 14, 2016. The information does not
alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
The authorities recently indicated that although they will support legislation
later in the year that would reverse the 2013 retirement age increases and increase the
constitutional court-mandated personal income tax (PIT) tax-free allowance, these
changes are unlikely to take effect before 2018. This will postpone the fiscal impact of the
retirement age increase, about 0.5 percent of GDP per annum, by one year. The government
will also reform the PIT framework to introduce a unified tax on income, and social security
and health contributions. The staff report accounts for these measures as fiscal risks that are
not included in the baseline projections.

Statement by Ludwik Kotecki, Alternate Executive Director for Republic of Poland
and Joanna Osinska, Advisor to Executive Director
June 27, 2016
On behalf of our Polish authorities, we would like to thank staff for constructive
consultations held in Warsaw and an interesting set of papers. Poland has continued to enjoy
a strong economic growth, while strengthening its policy buffers. The fiscal deficit dropped
to 2.6 percent of GDP in 2015, which was a better outcome than expected. The current
account deficit and unemployment rate reached historically low levels. The financial sector
remains sound and resilient. Inflation, driven mostly by external factors, is still subdued. A
new government, which took office in November 2015, is focused on supporting a strong and
inclusive growth while maintaining the sustainability of public finance. Overall, the outlook
is for a robust growth and a gradual return of inflation towards the target over the medium
term.
Economic Outlook
Poland’s real GDP grew by 3.6 percent in 2015. Domestic demand remained the key source
of that growth, with private consumption supported by higher disposable income (declining
prices coupled with growing wages) and decreasing unemployment. Also, a healthy credit
expansion, accommodative financial conditions and a relatively high competitiveness of
Polish companies helped support private investment. Poland continues to rank favorably in
terms of economic growth among the EU countries.
The economic growth is expected to remain strong. It is forecast to accelerate to 3.8 percent
in 2016, and to increase gradually thereafter to 4.1 percent in 2019. Growth will be
supported, among others, by an increased inflow of the EU structural funds. Poland is set to
be the biggest beneficiary of the European multi-annual financial framework for the years
2014-2020.
Along with the stronger economic growth, unemployment has been steadily declining and it
reached a historically low level of 6.3 percent in March/April 2016. Notably, this is well
below the EU average and it constitutes the lowest level since the beginning of economic
transition in Poland in the early 1990s.
External Sector
In 2015, the current account (CA) deficit—at 0.2 percent of GDP—reached its lowest level in
two decades. This was mainly due to a record high trade surplus, reflecting lower oil prices
and improved terms-of-trade. In the recent quarters, exports have been supported by an
increase in the economic activity in other EU countries. At the same time, imports have
recently strengthened due to an improvement of dynamics of domestic demand. This has only
been partially mitigated by the positive effect of lower oil prices. The overall external
position in 2015 was consistent with fundamentals and desirable policies. The CA deficit
continues to be comfortably covered by the capital account surplus, driven mainly by the
inflow of the EU funds.

2
The official foreign reserves remain broadly adequate at about 107 percent of the IMF’s
modified composite reserve adequacy metric, as of end-2015. Their level has further slightly
increased since the beginning of the year, in both EUR and USD-terms, to around 97 and 108
billion, respectively, at end-May. In addition, Poland continues to benefit from the
precautionary Flexible Credit Line (FCL) arrangement with the Fund, since January this year
with a further lowered level of access—in line with the authorities’ request and their exit
strategy. The FCL provides a valuable added insurance against adverse external shocks.
Fiscal Policy
The new government’s priority objective is to promote strong and inclusive economic growth
while pursuing fiscal policy within the constraints of the domestic and the EU fiscal rules.
The general government deficit is expected to remain at 2.6 percent of GDP this year
(unchanged from 2015), to increase to 2.9 in 2017, and to decrease gradually thereafter to 1.3
percent of GDP in 2019. The authorities reiterate their commitment to keeping the deficit
below 3 percent of GDP in line with EU framework, and obeying the domestic expenditure
rule. The latter should also ensure keeping the general government debt significantly below
the 60 percent of GDP threshold—at end-2015 it amounted to 51.3 percent of GDP.
The government’s flagship social scheme is the new family support program Family 500
plus, implemented from April 2016 onwards. The program is intended to facilitate an
increase in the fertility rate and support disposable incomes of families with children. This
should help counter unfavorable demographic trends, improve future labor supply and
strengthen growth potential over the longer term. The program would also help reduce
poverty and inequality.
New expenditures related to the implementation of the authorities’ priority social and
economic goals require strengthening of the revenue side of the state budget. To this effect, a
wide set of measures are being taken, including, inter alia, a new tax on the financial
institutions’ assets (already implemented) and a comprehensive strategy to improve tax
administration and fight tax evasion. The strategy includes (i) an introduction of a General
Anti-Avoidance rule against tax avoidance; (ii) a reduction of the limit on cash transactions
between companies from EUR 15,000 to PLN 15,000; (iii) a reorganization of tax and
customs administration and establishment of the National Fiscal Administration—drawing on
the Fund’s TA recommendation1 to establish a single and unified, national tax administration;
(iv) an introduction of an integrated IT system to track VAT invoices; among others.
Importantly, the above measures should be looked at in the context of the government’s
recognition that the so called “VAT gap” in Poland remains one of the highest in the EU.
Thus, the authorities consider that a significant improvement in the effectiveness of the tax
collection is crucial. It may also create additional fiscal space for the implementation of the
government’s priority social and economic measures. Two other proposals in this regard are
currently in the sphere of public debate, namely (i) a revision of the 2013 retirement age

increases and (ii) an increase in the personal income tax (PIT) tax-free allowance, as
mandated by a constitutional court’s ruling.
Both proposals are at the stage of conceptual work with the intention to present a draft
legislation by the end of the year. However, as indicated recently by government officials,
implementation before 2018 is rather unlikely. The authorities are of the view that potential
adverse impact of the considered changes to the retirement age can be mitigated by adjusting
parametric conditions for entitlement to retirement. Regarding the increase in the PIT tax-free
allowance, the authorities consider that it could be introduced as a part of a more
comprehensive income tax reform, with lost revenues from higher new allowance offset by a
more progressive tax regime.
Monetary Policy
Amid depressed global commodity prices, inflation in Poland remained very low, at -0.9
percent on average in 2015. While the CPI deflation had bottomed out since early-2015, it
remains at -0.9 percent, as of May. Recently, also the core inflation has turned negative and
it currently stands at -0.4 percent, as of May. These weak price dynamics are related to the
pass-through from low commodity prices to other CPI components and a still slightly
negative output gap. Nevertheless, so far, the low inflation has not materially affected neither
households nor corporates. Firms continue to report good financial and liquidity conditions,
with the share of profitable companies close to all-time-highs; and consumer demand is
growing steadily.
Against this backdrop, the Narodowy Bank Polski (NBP) took advantage of its flexible
approach to inflation targeting, striving to maintain price stability in the medium term, while
supporting balanced economic growth. Since March 2015 the Monetary Policy Council
(MPC) has kept the policy rate at the all-time low of 1.50 percent (completing the easing
cycle of 325 bps initiated in late-2012). The MPC recognizes the external nature of the price
shocks and points to the stable domestic economic growth accompanied by marked
improvement in the labor market conditions. At this juncture, the MPC considers the current
level of interest rates as conducive to keeping the Polish economy on the sustainable growth
path and maintaining macroeconomic balance.
Financial Sector
The Polish financial sector has remained stable and resilient, supported by the solid economic
growth. Banks remain liquid, well-capitalized and maintain low leverage, which result both
from the high value of regulatory capital and the conservative level of risk weights used to
calculate capital adequacy. In line with recommendations issued by the Financial Supervisory
Authority, banks maintained their capital buffers with the capital adequacy ratio reaching
16.7 percent at the end of Q1 2016 and Tier 1 capital representing around 90 percent of total
capital. At the same time, the funding structure of Polish banks remains favorable, as
evidenced by a low funding gap, a large share of household deposits in liabilities and low
reliance on the potentially less stable market funding.
Although in Q4 2015 and Q1 2016 the earnings and profitability ratios of the banking sector
decreased, they remain at comfortable levels. The decrease in profitability was mainly the

4
result of less favorable environment (i.e. low interest rates) as well as higher costs of banking
activity (due to a one-off contribution to the Bank Guarantee Fund due to deposit payouts as
well as initial contributions to the Borrower Support Fund established to provide a temporary
support to housing loan borrowers in difficult financial situation). In Q1 2016, for the first
time, banks had to pay the new asset tax introduced in February. Contrary to market
expectations, however, the additional tax has not significantly influenced the profitability in
the first months after its introduction. Also, credit flow to the economy has been growing at a
steady pace. Nonetheless, more time is needed to more thoroughly assess its overall impact.
The authorities intend to evaluate the performance of the new tax and adjust it if deemed
necessary.
Work has further progressed on measures to strengthen the financial sector and improve
supervision. The new macroprudential authority (Financial Stability Committee) became
fully operational in November 2015. The bank resolution framework—in line with the
European Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD)—has just been completed and
finally approved by the Parliament. Loan-to-value limits for housing and commercial real
estate loans, which came into force in early 2014, are gradually being tightened to help
further enhance loan quality. Since January 2016, the borrowers’ contribution should
constitute at least 15 percent of the real estate’s value. The share of non-performing loans
(NPLs) is slowly, yet steadily decreasing. The coverage of NPLs by provisions remains at a
comfortable level.
While virtually no new foreign-currency (FX) lending is taking place following the
introduction of stronger macroprudential measures, the outstanding stock of FX mortgages
accounts for around 9 percent of GDP, as of April, and the portfolio is runoff mode. The
government expressed its commitment to help FX mortgage holders in difficult situations,
recognizing their concerns that some of these loans had been extended without adequate
consumer information. Several alternative options for addressing this issue are being
discussed with multiple stakeholders, however, no specific proposal has been subject to
official consideration yet. The government is cognizant of the importance of ensuring that
any future proposal safeguards financial stability. To this aim, the government considers that
potential costs for banks would likely have to be extended over a longer time horizon.
Structural Reforms
The authorities have continued to implement structural reforms, as indicated in the staff
report. Directions of Poland’s economic development in the years to come have been
indicated in the new government’s Plan for Responsible Development2. It provides for
increasing the potential of the Polish economy through mobilizing domestic human and
financial capital, fostering innovations through increased R&D spending and developing
highly specialized industries, capable of building globally recognizable brands and products
as well as creating highly paid jobs. The aim of the Plan is to substantially increase the level
of investment over the next decade. Necessary actions to achieve that target include
development of financial instruments offered by the Polish Development Fund—newly

established entity integrating currently existing development institutions with the goal to
increase their effectiveness. An important element of the strategy is creating a favorable
institutional and legal environment increasing Poland’s investment attractiveness for foreign
capital. The Plan also focuses on social (in particular in the areas of demography and
education) and regional development promoting inclusion of small cities and rural areas.
Specific measures underpinning the Plan’s objectives will be reflected in the Strategy for
Responsible Development expected to follow by the end of the year.
