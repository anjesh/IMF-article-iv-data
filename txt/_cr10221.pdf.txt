EURO AREA POLICIES
Staff Report for the 2010 Article IV Consultation with Member Countries
Prepared by the European Department
Approved by Ajai Chopra and Tamim Bayoumi

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The current crisis is a wake-up call for the euro area. The crisis was largely caused by unsustainable policies in
some member countries, and has put the spotlight on the deficiency of area-wide mechanisms in disciplining
fiscal and structural policies. The sovereign crisis erupted before the euro area’s recovery could gain ground,
threatening the financial system and the regional and global recovery.
Despite a strong and far-reaching policy response, market confidence will take time to restore. Facing increasing
turmoil, the ECB stepped into the breach with liquidity and credit support aimed at avoiding market instability.
New European financing instruments are being created to assist euro area sovereigns, and several affected
member countries took additional fiscal action. While these measures should bolster confidence, further market
disruptions cannot be ruled out and will call for strong national policies and use of the newly created instruments
as needed.
Now, the underlying problems should be urgently addressed in a well-coordinated manner involving all euro area
countries:
 Fiscal sustainability needs to be established, with ambitious medium- and long-term adjustment plans
supplemented by short-term consolidation at a pace tailored to country circumstances;
 Growth needs to be boosted through swift implementation of structural reforms, which will also have a key
role to play in tackling intra-euro area imbalances;
 Weak parts of the banking system need to be identified and fundamentally restructured;
 Now is also the time to establish an effective economic and monetary union by strengthening the enforcement
of sound fiscal and structural policies and completing the area-wide framework for financial stability.
The authorities broadly concurred with this analysis, but the implementation is, as yet, patchy. Progress is being
made on fiscal consolidation, and weak banks are beginning to be tackled, but little is being done to address longstanding structural problems, including entitlement reforms, and true coordination of policymaking remains
elusive.
Staff: The team comprised Messrs. Belka (Head through May 27), Debrun, Everaert, Harjes, Valckx, Schindler,
and Ms. Perez Ruiz (all EUR), Mr. Nier (MCM), and Mr. van der Mensbrugghe (EUO). The Managing Director
presented the concluding statement to the Eurogroup on June 7, 2009. The cutoff date for information
presented in this report is June 16, 2010.
Analytical work: A separate selected issues paper discusses bank lending constraints, fiscal governance,
governance of structural reforms, and financial sector reform.

I. FROM GLOBAL TO EURO AREA CRISIS
A. Slow Recovery after the Global Crisis
1.
Already prior to the sovereign crisis, the euro area was slow to recover. With
strong reliance on its banking system for funding, pronounced uncertainty about the strength
of the financial system has been an important factor. In the staff’s view, recent data suggest
that financing constraints are binding on some segments of the economy, although the ECB
sees demand as the key factor underlying weak credit growth (Box 1). Meanwhile, needed
deleveraging of private sector balance sheets, improvements in competitiveness, and
reallocation of resources to tradable sectors in some countries is taking time. Furthermore,
despite employment-support measures in many countries, uncertainty about job prospects has
been weighing on households.
2.
The euro area was hard hit by the
global financial crisis. Shocks to external
demand and financial sector losses
contributed to a sharp downturn in real
activity in 2009. In the face of uncertain
prospects, investment fell dramatically
while consumption declined in response to
rising unemployment and increased
precautionary savings. Net exports fell, as
in Japan, but unlike in some other advanced
countries.

Unemployment increased
significantly during the global crisis,

However, outcomes varied widely across
countries, ranging from a dramatic increase

variations reflect differences in labor market

3.
Massive macroeconomic support
stabilized demand. In addition to substantial
monetary easing by the ECB, many member
countries allowed automatic stabilizers full
play and implemented fiscal stimulus
measures aimed at supporting private
consumption, limiting increases in
unemployment, and raising public
investment. These policies mitigated the
impact of the crisis, but together with bank
support, came with a rise in average euro
area government debt from about 66 percent
of GDP in 2007 to nearly 80 percent in 2009.

policies and institutions, such as short-time work schemes that limited the rise in
unemployment in several countries, but more recently also discouraged-worker effects. The
counterpart of labor hoarding in the face of substantial output losses was a significant decline
in productivity, suggesting that “jobless recoveries” are a likely outcome in many euro area
members.

tighter bank credit conditions (Figure 1).
Box 1. Are Bank Loan Supply Constraints Weighing On the Euro Area
Recovery?
Since the eruption of the global financial crisis, European banks have suffered heavy
losses. In response, some euro-area banks have issued additional equity or other forms
of capital and sharply reduced dividend payments, while profits recovered strongly, but
others remain thinly capitalized especially in view of further expected write-downs.
Whether possible capital
constraints affected aggregate
bank loan supply during the
early stage of the recession is
less clear. There have been
pockets of credit rationing in
some markets segments, but
aggregate data show that the
credit-to-GDP ratio continued to
rise and GDP led credit through
most of the euro-area recession.
Therefore, it is difficult to argue
that aggregate credit or bank
lending constraints caused the
recession.

But concerns about bank lending constraints are intensifying. Over the past year, bank
lending growth to nonfinancial corporations has fallen steeply and recently turned
negative, while net issuance of corporate debt has soared. This shift in the composition
of corporate debt from bank debt to bonds could imply binding bank lending
constraints. While a shift at the aggregate level could also be caused by a shift in
financing from riskier SMEs to large corporations during the downturn, credit costs
and spreads for lower rated and risky bonds have declined sharply at the same time the
substitution from bank debt to bonds occurred. Moreover, at individual firm level any
substitution towards bonds signals constraints on bank loan supply, as the risk level is
given.

deterioration was close to that for
SMEs. Moreover, the stable ratio of large loans to total corporate bank loans suggest
that bank loans to large corporations must have fallen as well as total loans declined
and the debt mix of large corporations with similar risk profiles must have shifted
significantly in favor of capital market debt.

8.
Vulnerabilities to sovereign risk proved to be significant, but differed markedly
across countries. The sensitivity of euro area countries’ sovereign and banking sector CDS
spreads to developments in Greece was moderate on average but significant in a number of
cases, while the equity market response was more broad-based. Portugal experienced the
fastest increase in debt spreads since April 2010 and by early June its 5-year CDS spreads

7
exceeded those of Ireland, while the increase for Spain was smaller and that for Italy
somewhat less again. However, nearly all countries but Germany saw some rise, and the
recent inversion in the sovereign CDS curve for Spanish, Greek and Portuguese debt signals
heightened investors concern. Average banking sector CDS spreads were pushed higher in
Greece, Spain, and Portugal than in the aftermath of the Lehman crisis (October 2008-March
2009). Continuous measures of contagion risk among banks, such as the ECB’s systemic
risk indicator and the IMF’s joint probability of distress, revealed a peak in May 2010,
exceeding the previous peaks of September 2008.
9.
Despite the agreement on the Greek rescue package, market tensions escalated,
requiring stronger measures. Tensions rose sharply on May 7, threatening a financial
meltdown. The ECB rightly stepped into the breach with a Securities Markets Program
(SMP), allowing it to purchase private and public securities in secondary markets, while
governments agreed to establish a European Stabilization Mechanism (ESM) to preserve
financial stability. Enhanced liquidity support and currency swap lines with other central
banks were also reinstated. Staff and authorities agreed that these programs were necessary
to avoid a contagion-driven systemic debt crisis, but that they could not substitute for
fundamental adjustment. Indeed, the ECB remains determined to keep inflation expectations
well anchored and emphasized the temporary nature of its SMP which is geared at curbing
volatility while not fighting fundamental trends. Consistent with this approach, the ECB has
not announced volume or price targets under its SMP. It will thus be crucial for national
authorities to implement corrective measures, as they committed to when the crisis measures
were adopted.1

restocking and strong export performance
continue to drive short-term dynamics, while private consumption and investment remain
weak, given uncertainty and substantial idle capacity. Hence, it was agreed that GDP growth
would average about 1 percent in 2010, and rise to about 1¼ percent in 2011. Consequently,

the euro area is not contributing much to the regional and global recovery. In this
environment inflation is expected to be subdued. Divergences across countries are likely to
rise because of differences in financial conditions, the pace of fiscal adjustment, and labor
market dynamics.

inevitably dampen demand in the short run.
Elsewhere, a more gradual approach, supported by entitlement reforms would contain the
immediate drag on demand. Although difficult to quantify, confidence enhancing effects of
establishing fiscal sustainability should partly offset the impact of fiscal adjustment, through
a reduction in precautionary buffers from

All agreed that the recent crisis had
raised uncertainty considerably, creating
significant downside risks. High-frequency
indicators are consistent with a relatively
strong second quarter in 2010, driven by the
global recovery in trade and manufacturing
which could provide an upside surprise
(Figure 3). Bridge model forecasts are
somewhat higher than the current WEO
baseline, but the sovereign crisis seems to
have stalled momentum and confidence
indicators weakened significantly following
the heightened market tensions in May.
Should this shift in confidence become
entrenched, a sharp weakening of growth in
the second half of 2010 would occur.

13.
Sovereign risk and its nexus with the financial system are the dominant concern
(Box 2). Indeed, since the onset of the crisis, spillovers from sovereigns to the banking
system have increased market and liquidity risk. The authorities agreed that failure to meet
the challenge of establishing fiscal sustainability and address counterparty risk would fuel
the adverse feedback loop between the financial system and public finances, to the detriment
of financial stability and the outlook for the regional and global economy. It could lead to a
sharp rise in risk premiums and a disorderly depreciation of the euro. The authorities felt,
however, that with the European Stability Mechanism now in place, such a disorderly
scenario could be avoided. Like staff, they saw a scenario without disruptive movements, but
with lackluster demand, low inflation and high public debt, leading to a prolonged period of
stagnation, as a distinct possibility. This would especially be the case if competitiveness and
private debt overhang problems were left unaddressed.
14.
The staff emphasized that weaknesses in part of the banking system also entail
risks, though the authorities felt that systemic risk from within the financial system had
diminished. Profitability of banks had increased overall, but a persistent number of banks
continue to underperform, posing a threat to the financial sector recovery and leading to
segmentation in money and bank funding markets (Figure 4). Moreover, the performance of
banks may come under further pressure from increased risk premiums, heightened market
uncertainty, reduced government support, and loan-loss provisioning continuing at very high
levels. The ECB noted that losses in the remainder of 2010 and 2011 would amount to
euro 230 billion, with a further risk of substantial write-downs on marked-to-market debt
securities. A considerable refinancing need over the same period will coincide, and could
compete, with sovereign issuance. The ECB noted that risks had become more institutionspecific ahead of the sovereign jitters, but acknowledged the staff’s observation that the
financial system could be adversely affected by the accumulation of weaknesses in a large
number of smaller institutions, which calls for a broader coverage of financial institutions in
macro-prudential supervision and stress testing. Indeed, since the mission, banks’ CDS
spreads and interbank funding strains have risen.

Box 2. Sovereign Challenges: Solvency and Liquidity
The fiscal response to the crisis, structural revenue losses, and the assumption of
implicit liabilities in the banking sector have left most euro area economies with the
challenges of establishing sustainability, managing liquidity risk, and dealing with the
feedback between public finances and the financial system.

15.
Bank capitalization broadly increased but remains low in an international
context and uncertainties over the adequate size and quality of capital prevail. Capital
levels improved markedly through early 2010 as banks continued to delever, retain more
earnings and actively raised capital buffers through renewed and innovative equity and bond
issuance as well as public interventions. However, in an international perspective, euro area
banks’ capital buffers remain low (see the April 2010 GFSR) and profit retention will be
paramount, much like it was in 2009. The ECB, while acknowledging that the quality of
capital could be improved, noted that capital buffers of large and complex banking groups
had now risen to above pre-crisis levels and seemed adequate for the major euro area banks.
16.
The euro area sovereign crisis is likely to have significant spillovers, especially if
downside risks materialize. Various channels are at work: lower domestic demand and a
more depreciated euro; reduced risk appetite and a diversion of capital flows; and weaker
balance sheets of euro area banks. If the crisis is contained through strong policy
implementation and the euro remains close to its fundamental value, spillover effects are

12
expected to be limited and regional, mostly affecting other EU countries and Switzerland, in
the latter case initially through safe haven effects. If downside risks were to materialize,
however, the consequences could be severe, threatening the global recovery, with global
financial conditions tightening sharply and the euro depreciating substantially (see downside
scenario in WEO Update of July 2010).
III. OVERCOMING THE CRISIS: SUSTAINABILITY, STABILITY, AND GROWTH
17.
The ECB and the EC strongly agreed with the staff that the crisis management
measures put in place are no alternative for immediate action to secure fiscal
sustainability, address weak banks, and boost growth. While the staff stressed the need
for well-coordinated and joint action across the euro area, national authorities saw more
urgency for action in the countries most affected by market pressures and a greater role for
national initiatives, especially in tackling banks and structural issues.
18.
While fundamental reforms should bolster confidence, the staff noted that full
advantage should be taken of the establishment of the new financing facilities,
especially as further market disruptions cannot be ruled out. The authorities observed
that the European Financial Stability Mechanism (EFSM), with resources up to euro
60 billion, had been available since early May to meet any EU member’s financing needs.
They expected the larger European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), specifically designed
for euro area members, to be fully operational in July 2010. Use of both facilities would be
subject to strict conditionality and operate in conjunction with an IMF program. The staff
welcomed the facilities, underscoring the need for flexibility to deal with unforeseen
circumstances and the usefulness of actually activating them to enhance the credibility of the
authorities’ overall approach in dealing with the crisis. Accordingly, the staff suggested that
use of the newly created instruments be considered also in a precautionary manner and for
the resolution of difficulties in the banking system.
A. Adjusting and Consolidating Public Finances
19.
Although the nascent recovery remains dependent on policy support, sovereign
market stress constrains fiscal policy. Staff and the authorities agreed that countries facing
severe financial market stress had no option but to undertake immediate fiscal adjustment, as
is already underway. The ECB emphasized that in these cases, front-loading and accelerating
fiscal consolidation was indispensable to limit contagion risks and prevent an adverse
feedback loop between financial markets and fiscal policies. Nevertheless, the staff
emphasized that countries with manageable debt dynamics can maintain their current plans in
the context of credible medium-term adjustment programs. As a result, with the considerable
near-term fiscal easing in Germany, the overall fiscal stance in the euro area would remain
broadly neutral in 2010 (Figure 5).

13
20.
There was agreement that all member states need to start sustained
consolidations at the latest in 2011, with the magnitude varying according to the state of
public finances. Current deficit targets imply synchronized consolidations leading to deficits
below the SGP limit by 2013 in most cases. With all but one euro area countries now under
the Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP), the corrective arm of the Stability and Growth
Pact—that member states have agreed to significantly strengthen, including through a wider
use of sanctions and enhanced peer pressure—should prompt effective actions and serve as a
medium-term anchor. However, additional efforts will be needed to stabilize debt dynamics
over the long term.
21.
While compliance with the deficit targets set out in EDPs is a top priority, the
staff emphasized the need to maximize confidence in long-term sustainability and limit
the short-term impact on growth. In the authorities’ view, the adverse confidence effect of
allowing some countries to deviate from the agreed adjustment path would outweigh the
benefits of fine-tuning the short-term impact of consolidation on economic activity. Staff
welcomed the already substantial differentiation across member states of the pace of deficit
reduction under EDPs, but with the still patchy and uncertain recovery emphasized that the
composition of the adjustment should be mindful of minimizing immediate damage to
demand, while maximizing confidence effects.
22.
To this effect, fiscal adjustment plans need to be strengthened considerably.
They should focus structural expenditure cuts on distortive and ineffective programs, such as
the elimination of certain price and production subsidies, and a shift from universal to
targeted social transfers which would preserve spending by low income earners, while
boosting confidence in the return to sustainable spending patterns. Ambitious entitlement
reforms—such as measures aimed at increasing the effective retirement age—are essential to
deliver large credibility gains at a lesser cost in terms of short-term growth. In contrast,
across-the-board cuts in public investment programs should be avoided. In some countries,
comprehensive tax reforms should aim at broadening the tax base, reducing distortions and
improving compliance. In this respect, the coordinated introduction of a Financial Activities
Tax would be helpful.2
23.
Staff and the authorities agreed that fiscal risks will best be managed through a
resolute implementation of recently announced measures and detailed medium-term
action plans. The authorities expressed concerns about slippage in attaining medium-term
targets, which often reflect optimistic growth forecasts and suffer from a lack of specifics on
the underlying measures. Staff and the authorities agreed on the urgency for national
governments to lift these uncertainties by laying out detailed medium-term action plans
backed by concrete and credible measures.

14
B. Addressing Weaknesses in Banks
24.
Problems in banking segments that continue to perform poorly must be tackled.
Decisive actions are already underway in some countries (e.g., Ireland and Spain), but
voluntary measures are unlikely to be sufficient and in some countries (e.g., Germany) longstanding problems are yet to be addressed. Furthermore, a number of banks, including some
mid-size, remains heavily reliant on ECB financing facilities or on government support. Staff
suggested several possible avenues, ranging from forcing those banks to raise additional
capital and more decisively clean-up their balance sheets, to restructuring and resolution
where viable business models cannot be established. Staff agreed that some blanket financial
support measures may need to be extended, but cautioned that care be taken that the urgency
to restructure is not put off and competition not distorted. It advocated a stronger role for EU
institutions and mechanisms, given the cross-border dimension and the limited fiscal capacity
of some member states.
25.
Euro area authorities agreed with the need to address weak banks, but noted
limits to their capacity to act. The ECB had to reverse its gradual phasing out of nonstandard measures due to the sovereign crisis. It had previously urged national authorities
and supervisors to address market access of the “persistent bidders,” but with little success,
complicating the ECB’s exit strategy. The EC can only intervene based on state-aid rules and
competition grounds, which means that the initiative often rests with national authorities. As
a result, problem cases come to the EC’s attention at a fairly late stage, often after adverse
spillovers are already felt. The EC clarified that government guarantee schemes on bank debt
may be extended beyond the review date of June 30, 2010, but—in an effort to wean banks
off state support—would become more expensive over time, linked to banks’ credit rating
and a viability review if the amount of guarantees breached certain thresholds.3 While the
current crisis management mechanisms were not designed to deal directly with banks, the
authorities agreed that, should they be used, resources could be set aside to support banks as
was done in the case of Greece.
26.
The staff emphasized that stress tests should be used more effectively in
conjunction with remedial action to help improve the financial system. Currently stress
tests are being overseen by national supervisors and coordinated by CEBS aimed at testing
the resilience of large banks to corporate and household sector credit losses and assessing the
effect of continued reliance on government support. To reduce aggregate uncertainty and
induce a greater willingness to tackle troubled banks, staff called for a more detailed
disclosure of inputs and outcomes, possibly at the institution-level, together with
announcements of remedial actions by weak institutions to mitigate capital shortfalls, a view
shared by the EC. The staff also called for broadening the transparent use of stress tests
beyond the largest institutions covered in the CEBS tests. With sovereign risk predominant,
staff agreed that communication would need to be handled carefully. Supervisors felt that
disclosure of individual bank results could prove too market-sensitive and some national
authorities noted legal impediments to publication.

Bans on short selling cannot alter
fundamentals and may reduce confidence.
Germany’s unilateral ban on selected short selling
does not appear well-founded in the absence of
proven market abuse. Analysis shows that
variations in sovereign CDS spreads are well
explained by fundamentals, i.e., deficit and debt
ratios and EMU membership (with a discount for
peripheral countries and Italy), in most countries,
including Germany.

C. Reinvigorating Growth
28.
Reinvigorating growth in the euro area will be crucial. It was agreed that growthenhancing reforms are essential to achieve fiscal sustainability. Raising growth potential will
require preventing increases in structural unemployment and tackling bottlenecks. Reducing
the work disincentives embedded in tax and benefits systems would raise fiscal revenues
already in the short run. And regulatory reforms should generate substantial government
revenues as soon as employment rates recover. Policy action is not only necessary in member
countries suffering from excessive fiscal and external imbalances, but throughout the euro
area to generate confidence, display cohesion, and improve overall investment and growth
prospects.
29.
The staff argued that the current crisis provides a not-to-be-missed opportunity
to move ahead with difficult reforms. Structural reforms often need to overcome the
interests of large and powerful insiders. However, with a sense of urgency spreading among
the electorate and the markets, some euro area countries are moving ahead, hopefully setting
a precedent. The EC and ECB have also stepped up their call for rapid progress.
30.
The authorities and staff agreed on the key reform priorities, which are country
specific (Table 3). Labor market models perform very differently across euro area countries,
both in terms of efficiency and equity. Most Mediterranean countries fare poorly and need to
address labor market segmentation, inadequate wage flexibility and skill mismatches. They
should also upgrade education systems and foster capital deepening and innovation. Most
other countries still need to ease stringent employment protection rules and take measures to
improve job matching. For all, further liberalization of product and services markets under
the Single Market program will strengthen the employment effects of labor market reform.
The staff called for measures to generally reduce public ownership and involvement in
business operations, especially in the banking sector; lower barriers to competition still
present in network industries, retail trade and liberal professions; and remove administrative
barriers on start-ups. It argued that reform in bankruptcy proceedings, most clearly in
Southern countries, will help facilitate firm turnover and entrepreneurship, and that potential
growth would profit from a deficit-neutral shift in taxes from labor to consumption (e.g.,
VAT), preferably coordinated across the euro area.

16
31.
Policies need to be readjusted to limit the risk of a permanent reduction in
potential output. There is broad consensus that, thanks to past reforms, the impact of the
crisis on structural unemployment is expected to be more moderate than in previous severe
downturns in the majority of euro area countries. It was agreed that the temporary extension
of benefits in response to the crisis will need to be reversed, incentives to early retirement
removed and unemployment benefits conditioned on tightened activation and effective
training. The staff called for further trade liberalization, the unwinding of sectoral subsidies
and the end to disguised forms of protectionism.
IV. INFLATION AND THE ROLE OF MONETARY POLICY
32.
Disinflationary pressure persists in the face of weak domestic demand. The
rebound in energy prices pushed headline inflation back into positive territory (1.6 percent in
May) but core inflation excluding volatile food and energy prices and other measures of
underlying inflation, such as trimmed means, have gradually fallen below 1 percent,
reflecting a steady downward trend in services and industrial goods price inflation (Figure 6).
Prices have dropped sharply for items that tend to respond very elastically to weak economic
conditions and income uncertainty. Goods prices weakened significantly with the fall in
global demand and have not yet responded much to the recent euro depreciation. This also
holds for the non-energy components of producer
prices on account of low input and operating costs and

inflation will stay low over the forecast
horizon. The bottom-up, componentsbased forecast shows inflation at about 1.5 percent at the end of 2011, largely reflecting
subdued service and non-energy goods price inflation. In contrast to the WEO and other
forecasts, and influenced by estimates of a more typical cycle, the monthly New Keynesian
DSGE inflation model predicts the output gap to shrink rapidly and therefore inflation to
return to about 2 percent within the forecast horizon that ends in February 2012.
34.
It was agreed that long-term inflation expectations remain well anchored and
risks to inflation are broadly balanced. While the ECB agreed that deflationary periods
could occur in countries that face significant pressure to reduce large fiscal and current
account deficits, it did not see a significant risk of overall deflation owing to price rigidities
and the strong anchoring of expectations. Moreover, breakeven inflation rates have
rebounded following the slump in 2009 and are close to 2 percent, but unsettled liquidity
conditions make the measure somewhat volatile (Figure 7). Survey-based measures of longterm inflation expectations are around 2 percent and generally tend to move very little.
Uncertainty about future inflation measured as the dispersion of expectations in surveys or
extracted from inflation derivatives, remains elevated, however. This seems to reflect
concerns that a weak financial sector and a heavy public debt burden could prevent a
sufficient policy tightening once the recovery gains traction and ultimately cause inflation to
exceed its target. The ECB further noted that increases in indirect taxation and administered
prices and energy-price and exchange rate fluctuations could produce occasional spikes in
inflation.
35.
The ECB and the staff agreed that the monetary policy stance can remain very
supportive. With the policy rate at 1 percent and the ECB deposit rate at 25 basis points,
overnight rates have mostly hovered in the range of 35–45 basis points. Ample liquidity,
especially injected through longer-term operations, has lowered the volume of overnight
money market operations but without excessively reducing activity in interbank markets
(Figure 8). The pass-through of lower policy rates to market and bank lending rates had been
complete and term and risk premiums in money, bank lending and corporate debt markets
had receded significantly as well. However, recent tensions in euro area sovereign debt
markets caused some sovereign spreads to rise sharply and led to a widening in money and

18
credit market spreads (Figures 9, 10). Moreover, even if these tensions subside, capital
constraints may weigh on corporate bank credit supply and render low policy rates less
effective. A variety of models suggest that policy rates can remain low, but differ somewhat
in the timing of when they should start rising.
36.
There was agreement that the ECB could resume gradual exit from its nonstandard policy support once systemic liquidity conditions ease. Non-standard support
measures have been essential in meeting high systemic liquidity needs, but are also distorting
market mechanisms and reducing incentives for weak banks to restructure. The experience
with the unwinding of long-term refinancing operations suggests that the same criteria to
begin to exit can be used as in the past. Tightening collateral requirements will be difficult
and should wait until the euro area crisis is resolved. Beyond the near term, the collateral
framework may need to be revisited to address concerns about the quality of the ECB
balance sheet.
V. ADDRESSING INTRA-EURO AREA IMBALANCES
37.
The significant increase in individual euro area member current account deficits
and surpluses and their persistence since the advent of EMU has been partly reversed
by the recent crisis. It was agreed that equilibrium phenomena, such as different
demographics and long-term growth dynamics justify some imbalances. Weak domestic
demand, notably low corporate investment in Germany also played a role, but the major
drivers were to be found in the deficit countries, facilitated by easy financing by foreign
investors. Domestic imbalances linked to unsustainable credit and construction booms, a lack
of fiscal restraint, and unsustainable wage developments all contributed significantly. As a
result, unsustainable asset and demand booms emerged in some places, and a common

38.
There was agreement that resolution of euro area imbalances will require a
multi-pronged approach, with both surplus and deficit countries contributing:


In surplus countries, fiscal policy is providing short-term relief, e.g., with Germany’s
headline deficit set to double in 2010. But the effect of this policy is indirect and very
small, reflecting the small size of trade flows: for example, exports to Germany from
Greece, Italy, Portugal, and Spain averaged only about 2 percent of their GDP during
the pre-crisis years. Staff simulations with NIGEM, suggest that a one percent of

Resolving intra-euro area imbalances is also linked to avoiding global imbalances
(Figure 15). A euro remaining in line with its fundamentals—consistent with a small
euro area current account surplus—would facilitate adjustment in several large deficit
countries for which price competitiveness is key, though effects of euro depreciation
differ markedly across countries (e.g., for Italy and Spain they would be larger than
the euro area average, while for Greece and Portugal they would be smaller). Reforms
in other countries would strengthen overall growth in the euro area with positive
effects globally.

VI. REFORMING POLICY FRAMEWORKS
A. Strengthening Fiscal Policy Surveillance and the Stability and Growth Pact
39.
Fundamental gaps in the euro area’s fiscal framework increased fiscal
vulnerability during the crisis and urgently need to be addressed. Staff and the
authorities broadly agreed that three long-standing weaknesses had been exposed by the
crisis. First, the SGP has failed to encourage the buildup of sufficient buffers in good times,
and lower debt to prudent levels, limiting room for maneuver in bad times. Second, weak
governance has aggravated structural flaws. Specifically, fiscal surveillance has been
narrowly focused on procedural aspects and formal deficit limits, while EDP enforcement
suffered from the Council’s reluctance to use binding legal instruments to mandate policy
corrections. The result was insufficient scope for sound economic judgment to shape policy
recommendations, constraining an effective use of preventive legal instruments. Third, the
fiscal framework has been lacking centralized crisis management and resolution capacities, a
gap now temporarily being filled by the European Stabilization Mechanism.
40.
Staff welcomed the authorities’ initiative to launch a broad debate on improving
fiscal governance, but emphasized that ambitious reforms were needed to foster
compliance with the rules. The EC has issued a consistent set of recommendations to
address key issues in the operation of the SGP.4 The President’s Task Force on economic
governance initiated its own discussions by exploring ways to enhance sanctions against
countries violating the common fiscal rules, taking the EC’s proposal as a basis for
discussion. Staff argued that more fundamental steps were needed. In particular, the flawed
enforcement procedure of the SGP needs repair to make sure that binding provisions of the
EDP—including sanctions—are enforced when violations of the rules are patent.
41.
Staff discussed various options to enhance the enforcement of corrective
provisions in the EDP and expand their applicability to key preventive aspects of the
SGP. Two broad classes of proposals were discussed.
a.

4

A shift of policy authority to the center that would either curtail member
states’ discretion in areas of common interest—for example by issuing binding
deficit limits—or enhance individual incentives to comply with existing rules—
for instance through access to a common Euro bond issuance—was debated.

The May 12, 2010, EC communication proposes to reinforce policy coordination in the EU in general and the
euro area in particular. All proposals are based on the Treaty and only require changes in secondary legislation
and codes of conduct. The communication features: (i) a strengthening of the SGP mainly by stepping up
sanctions (including in the preventive arm) and activating the EDP using the debt criterion, (ii) a more intrusive
surveillance of external imbalances in the euro area (involving early warnings and recommendations in a wide
array of policies), (iii) stronger ex-ante coordination through a “European semester” (involving peer review of
budget proposals and policy guidance from the EC and the Council before submission to national parliaments),
and (iv) a permanent framework of crisis management along the lines of the European Stabilization Mechanism
(ESM).

21
However, these options require Treaty changes around which consensus may
take time to build. Also, the ECB was concerned by the moral hazard
implications of pooling debt issuance. Nonetheless, staff felt that in the long run
a shift in policy authority to the euro area level would be essential.
b.

It was agreed that greater ownership of the common rules at the national
level could facilitate enforcement. Euro-area member states could be
mandated to transpose in their national fiscal frameworks the common standards
of fiscal responsibility, based on Article 136 of the Treaty. Regardless of the
process, the harmonization of national frameworks should be guided by two
principles: (i) rules in line with the spirit of the SGP, that is a structural balance
close to balance or in surplus, and (ii) a credible national enforcement procedure
which would be adapted to the particular context of each member state in terms
of decentralization, form of government, and legal tradition. The authorities
expressed interest in that approach as a way to ameliorate the enforcement
problem.
B. Improving Governance over Structural Reforms

42.
Weak governance is regarded as an important element underlying the Lisbon
Strategy’s poor effectiveness, even though the strategy is useful in setting the agenda for
growth-oriented structural reforms in the euro area. The EC’s diagnosis is strong, but the
authorities agreed that implementation was lagging. Progress had been uneven across areas,
with key labor market reforms missing. The EC felt that ownership of the strategy had
remained weak, with infrequent debates held by the European Council and rare decisive
policy action.
43.
Staff emphasized three key challenges for Europe 2020 to become a central
element of the EU’s response to the crisis. First, the strategy should to be focused on the
delivery of a narrower set of policy goals, as currently envisaged, but perhaps with even
more emphasis on employment rates and education. Second, surveillance over structural
bottlenecks, competitiveness and imbalances needs to be integrated with fiscal surveillance.
Third, a sustained commitment of the European Council and the Eurogroup on structural
reforms will be key. While the EU is fully committed to make fast progress along these lines,
close integration within the policy debate of the President’s Task force on economic
governance will be essential.
44.
The Eurogroup will need to play a pivotal role in the peer review of key
structural policies. By aligning surveillance over fiscal and key related structural policies
(labor taxation, social benefits, employment protection and wage bargaining) greater account
can be taken of policy interactions and the prevention and correction of intra-euro
imbalances. The upgrading of the peer review in fundamental structural reforms foreseen in
the EC’s May 12 Communication anticipates the Eurogroup to act as a collective body,
notably by providing systematic assessments and by communicating openly the benefits of
reforms for fiscal consolidation and the correction of external imbalances. When non-

22
compliance with the Council’s recommendations leads to significant cross-country spillovers
in EMU, the EC should address a policy warning to the Member States concerned, followed
by a public statement by the Council. Staff welcomes the EC’s suggestion that conditionality
could be enhanced by twinning EU budget expenditures to Council’s recommendations,
either by redirecting Structural Funds to remedy Member States’ major structural weaknesses
and competitiveness challenges or by suspending EU payments for non-compliers.
C. Rising to the Challenge of Financial Sector Reform
45.
In the wake of the global financial crisis, financial sector reform poses particular
challenges for the EU. The objective of establishing and maintaining an integrated market
for financial services across the euro area and wider EU needs to be underpinned with a set
of pan-European institutions to deal with regulation, supervision and resolution (including
deposit insurance). It also requires stronger capital and liquidity requirements, to be agreed
globally, to ensure greater resilience against stresses and avoid systemic disruptions from the
failure of individual institutions in the EU.
46.
The recent (“sovereign”) phase of the crisis has made this agenda all the more
pressing, in the staff’s view. It has underscored the potential for financial contagion to cross
European borders, reinforcing the need for robust regulation and a strong European element
in supervision and resolution. Recent crisis measures also showed, once again, the strength of
the inclination on the part of national authorities to act unilaterally, rather than in a
coordinated fashion, which added to uncertainty and confusion in financial markets.
47.
The ECOFIN Council’s agreement last December to establish a new European
supervisory structure represents an important milestone for the EU. The Parliament’s
Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has since issued a set of proposals to further
strengthen the overall framework. The authorities are aware that reconciliation needs to
avoid slippage in the establishment of the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) and
European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB).
48.
All agreed that a strong role of the ESAs in supervision and rulemaking was
desirable. However, the EC cautioned that direct supervisory powers for the European
Banking Authority (EBA) over the largest institutions, as proposed by Parliament, may not
be feasible, if the timeline for its establishment is to be kept. Both the EC and ECB pointed
to legal difficulties5 and argued that entrusting the EBA with more direct supervisory
responsibility may best be discussed in the context of the planned 2014 review of the new
arrangements, when the EBA would have established a track record. In the staff’s view a
useful immediate step would be a strong role for the EBA in the supervisory colleges for
cross-border groups. The outcome of negotiations should in addition ensure maximum

5

According to the EC and ECB, the Meroni judgment of 13 June 1958 constrained the sphere of discretion that
the EBA could be vested with under the Treaty, potentially affecting its ability to issue supervisory decisions.

23
information sharing and efficient rule-making procedures so as to advance the establishment
of a single rule-book across the EU.
49.
The ESRB can play a useful coordinating role in crisis prevention and some
aspects of crisis management. The EC agreed with staff that, without prejudice to the
setting of global standards by the Basel Committee, the ESRB should use its
recommendations to guide the calibration of preventive macro-prudential measures,
including to address the build-up of credit and liquidity risks from capital flows across the
EU. The EC explained that, contrary to a parliamentary proposal, the ESRB could not, for
legal reasons, be given immediate power to declare an emergency—and thus activate
emergency powers on the part of the ESAs. However, the staff suggested that it could
nonetheless be consulted before an emergency is declared and use the power of its
recommendations to achieve greater coordination of crisis measures across all sectors
(banking, insurance and securities). The staff also underscored that the ESRB would need to
have effective access to all relevant information.
50.
The introduction of stronger and harmonized early intervention and resolution
capabilities across the EU remains pressing. All agreed that European legislation should
establish a core set of early intervention and resolution tools and remove legal constraints on
their effective use. Staff also supports a risk-based levy on the banking system, as currently
proposed by the EC and Parliament, so as to establish financial stability funds, which will
also require a fiscal backstop. While some jurisdictions appear to prefer for levies to
contribute to the general budget, it makes no difference to the public sector’s financial
position whether a levy accrues to the general revenues or to a fund that invests in
government assets.6 Against this, a key advantage of a dedicated fund is that it can be
mobilized quickly to reduce systemic risks. A fund can aid the resolution of systemic
institutions—by providing funding to a bridge bank and assisting in the sale of the institution
to a third party—and enable early intervention, e.g., to force the sale of bad assets, including
those arising from cross-border exposures.
51.
A pan-European Financial Stability Fund can further strengthen financial
stability. Staff argued that such a Fund could be particularly useful as long as individual
countries are fiscally constrained. Moreover, even when national funds are “networked”, as
proposed by the EC, the need for strong guidance on burden sharing remains and might need
to be addressed through legislation. Recent proposals by an EFC working group to set up
crisis management groups for each individual cross-border institution and to require
institutions to prepare Recovery and Resolution Plans are further useful elements. So as to
have a neutral voice at the table, staff suggested for the EBAs to be represented in these
groups, with a mandate to mediate and monitor adherence to agreed crisis management
principles.

24
52.
The staff expressed concern that appetite for fundamental reform of capital and
liquidity requirements appeared to be waning in some countries. The EC and CEBS
explained that difficulties in calibration arose where there was substantial heterogeneity
across firms and differences in starting points across countries, e.g. as regards the definition
of capital. Against this, the staff argued that a robust calibration of measures currently being
debated at the global level remained important, so as to strengthen the resilience of the
European banking system to future shocks. The staff welcomed the EU’s work to ensure
robust arrangements for the clearing of derivatives. It should take full advantage of the
capital framework to create incentives and be advanced in a manner that allows the
emergence of a globally consistent approach.
VII. STAFF APPRAISAL
53.
The euro area is facing a severe crisis, requiring decisive action to deal with the
crisis and to complete the project of European Economic and Monetary Union. The
current crisis results from unsustainable policies in some countries, delayed repair of the
financial system, insufficient progress in establishing the discipline and flexibility needed for
a smooth functioning of the monetary union, and deficient governance of the euro area.
Consequently, divergences in economic performance have been allowed to fester, building
up imbalances and leading to the recent dramatic wake-up call from markets. The immediate
crisis response has been strong and far-reaching, demonstrating the euro-area’s capability to
act together when pressured. But while the newly created crisis management tools should be
used as needed, they should not be considered an alternative to the necessary corrective
policy actions and fundamental reforms.
54.
Heightened downside risks threaten a moderate and uneven recovery. The
nascent recovery, driven mainly by external demand, is likely to be slowed in the near term
by market tensions related to sovereign risks. Over the medium term, the need for fiscal
consolidation and structural rigidities will weigh on it, leading to persistent unemployment
and subdued investment. The depreciation of the euro, which is now broadly consistent with
fundamentals, will provide some relief. The sovereign crisis has created significant downside
risks. Since its onset, spillovers to the banking system have increased market and credit risk,
and could fuel the adverse feedback loop between the banking system and public
finances. Competitiveness problems and private debt overhang also loom large in some
member countries.
55.
Immediate action is needed to establish fiscal sustainability. Credible fiscal
adjustment must be at the core of the response. Countries facing market pressures have no
option but to adjust forcefully and meet their deficit targets. For all countries, additional
efforts must be made to turn around unfavorable debt dynamics over the medium term. The
pace of consolidation should however be differentiated across countries. The aggregate fiscal
stance of the euro area is correctly envisaged to be neutral in 2010, while consolidation will
start everywhere at the latest in 2011. The quality and composition of fiscal consolidation

25
will be important to support the recovery as much as possible, with entitlement reforms
featuring prominently.
56.
The long-standing problem of anemic growth in the euro area must now be
addressed. High growth is not only important for its own sake, but essential to secure fiscal
sustainability, facilitate the resolution of intra-euro area imbalances, and keep the global
recovery on track. Reform priorities have been well identified in the Lisbon strategy, but it is
now crucial to implement a set of country-specific structural reforms throughout the euro
area.
57.
The resilience of the banking system must be improved and its stability assured.
Banks overly reliant on liquidity or other government support should be forced to
recapitalize, restructure, of face resolution, a process that can be helped by effective use of
appropriately transparent stress tests, applied to a broad set of financial institutions. Blanket
financial support measures may need to be reinstated or extended, though care should be
taken that they do not put off the urgency to restructure. Rapid clarification of new capital
and liquidity requirements, set at sufficiently high levels to increase the banking system’s
resilience to future shocks, and properly phased in, will be important.
58.
The ECB has remained an anchor of stability throughout the crisis. Faced with a
sharp tightening of financial conditions in countries affected by the sovereign crisis, the ECB
rightly undertook strong action through its Securities Market Program and the reinstatement
of other non-standard measures to secure the effective transmission of its monetary stance.
Reflecting the ECB’s excellent track record, long-term inflation expectations remain well
anchored, keeping risks to price stability at bay. With inflationary pressures subdued, the
policy rate should remain low. Distortions related to protracted low rates need to be
monitored and addressed with macro-prudential tools.
59.
Economic governance of EMU needs to be strengthened to deliver the collective
responsibility necessary for a well-functioning economic and monetary union. While the
Commission’s proposals and early deliberations by the President’s Task Force are welcome,
focus should be on enforcing budgetary discipline, helped by fundamental legislative reform,
including at the national level. Key structural reforms to address macroeconomic imbalances
should be included in any new governance arrangements. Swift progress in this area will
enhance confidence.
60.
Progress in building the EU’s financial stability architecture should be pursued.
The establishment of more harmonized regulation and supervision of the EU financial system
is highly welcome and should be extended to the areas of crisis management and resolution.
The European Systemic Risk Board and European Supervisory Authorities need to be
granted a sufficiently strong mandate, including in crisis management and supervision of
cross-border institutions. A core set of effective resolution tools needs to be established to
raise the scope for coordination in the resolution of cross-border institutions, eventually
including a European Resolution Authority. The proposed risk-based levy on the banking

26
system deserves support. Consideration should be given to establishing financial stability
funds, with a role in resolution.
61.
The staff proposes that the next consultation on euro area policies in the context
of the Article IV obligations of member countries follow the standard 12-month cycle.

Recommendations
Reduce disincentives to work at older ages

Reduce the tax burden on labor (financed by lowering government spending and tax expenditures); reduce
replacement rates (especially for the long-term employed) and improve enforcement of job-search
requirements for the unemployed; mprove competition in services (gas and electricity markets, ease
regulation in the retail sector).
Improve competition in services (improve public procurement procedures, facilitate entry into network
industries, abolish the compulsory membership in associations for liberal professions); relax regular EPL;
strengthen the conditionality of unemployment benefits on willingness to take up work.
Reduce labor market dualism: reduce the gap in protection between permanent and temporary workers.
Lower severance payments for permanent contracts and incentivize the transition from fixed-term to openended contracts by increasing dismissal costs gradually with tenure length; allow firm level agreements to
prevail upon collectively bargained wages at higher levels and eliminate indexation; encourage job search
by removing the permanent increase in unemployment benefit duration adopted in 2009; further reduce
restrictions on retail trade , professional services and the rental market.
Ease regular EPL (simplify firing laws); reduce minimum wages; improve competition in the retail sector;
undo the permanent increase in the duration of unemployment benefits adopted during the crisis.
Reduce the tax wedge on labor income (financed by improved tax enforcement); reduce state involvement
in business by accelerating privatization and abolishing golden shares, especially in electricity, gas, post
and transport, and enterprises that provide local services; decentralize wage bargaining taking into
account regional differences in productivity; enhance the efficiency of public services (cut red-tape at all
levels of Government).
Increase participation of second earners (remove the right for non working partners in single-earner
couples to transfer their general tax credit to the primary earner) and working time of women; increase
participation of older workers; promote competition in retail distribution services; ease EPL for regular
Increase competition in the utilities and services sectors; reduce replacement rates for the long-term
employed.
Lower marginal tax rates on labor income (financed by broadening the tax base and reducing tax
allowances); remove barriers to competition in professional services and retail trade; further reduce
Reduce high marginal tax rates on labor across the income distribution (financied by switching from labor
to property taxes); reduce replacement rates for the long-term unemployed, use stricter activation
requirements to taper benefits over the unemployment spell; reform the wage setting system so that
wages are better aligned with productivity performance in non-tradables.
EPL reforms undertaken in 2008 (must be fully enforced; simplify the administration of the tax system,
broaden the tax bases and reduce tax expenditures; reduce unemployment benefits’ replacement rates;
reduce barriers to competition in network industries (telecommunications, electricity and transport).
Ease EPL by simplifying dismissal rules; reduce barriers to competition in professional services by easing
conduct regulation and lowering licencing and education requirements; improve job-search incentives by
tightening eligibility conditions for unemployment benefits and reducing replacement rates; eliminate
automatic backward-looking wage indexation over time.

APPENDIX I—STATISTICAL ISSUES
Statistics for the euro area (and the EU-27) are produced by Eurostat,1 in conjunction with
national statistical agencies within the European Statistical System (ESS), and the ECB,
working with national central banks within the Eurosystem/ESCB. 2 These statistics are of
sufficient quality, scope, and timeliness to allow effective macroeconomic surveillance,
thanks to major progress made since the introduction of the euro. However, the financial
crisis has generated a number of challenges for official statistics. Recent ongoing
developments and desirable improvements include:


ESS governance: The new statistical governance structure for the ESS was put in
place in 2009. The Regulation on European Statistics3 strengthens the European
Statistical System Committee (ESSC), which acts as an umbrella committee of the
ESS, the European Statistical Advisory Committee (ESAC), and the European
Statistical Governance Advisory Board (ESGAB). The new regulation strengthens
Eurotat’s role as a coordinator of statistical activities at EU level and National
Statistical Institutes at national level.



Impact of the crisis on official statistics: In addition to statistics related to the
financial crisis at national and EU level, the Interagency Group on Economic and
Financial Statistics with the participation of the IMF, BIS, Eurostat, ECB, World
Bank, and UNSC has started the process of setting up a set of global indicators
building on the European concept of PEEIs (Principal European Economic
Indicators). Discussions at the international level center on the extension of the
PEEIs, the improvement of techniques to identify turning points and the development
of an integrated view of business cycles, growth cycles and acceleration cycles. At
EU level, an ESS Action Plan on the accounting consequences of the financial crisis
was created to ensure the consistency across time and countries of the statistical
treatment of bank and other support operations in full respect of the ESA95 rules.



Public finance statistics–actions to tackle statistical and governance issues in
Greece: Efforts focus on the improvement of fiscal and other public sector reporting
by Greece. Working closely with Eurostat, the government has started to take

1

Eurostat has introduced a new, more user-friendly website. See: http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/. The ECB has
maintained a statistical data warehouse for euro area and related national statistics. See
http://sdw.ecb.europa.eu/. The division of tasks between both statistical systems has been spelled out in a
Memorandum of Understanding (http://www.ecb.europa.eu/ecb/legal/pdf/en_mou_with_eurostat1.pdf ).

2

Notably in the field of national accounts and government finance statistics, a consensus was reached on
Eurostat decisions thanks to the work done in common with national statisticians on a regular basis through task
forces, working groups and committees (National Accounts Working group, Financial Accounts Working
Group, Committee on Monetary, Financial and Balance of Payments statistics, and GNI Committee).

Regulation No. 223/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council, published in the Official Journal of
the European Union on March 31, 2009.

46
measures to prevent the recurrence of under- and misreporting problems and designed
jointly with the European Commission an action plan to address outstanding
statistical issues. Full independence has been granted to the Greek Statistical Office
and its resources increased to improve statistical systems and seek appropriate
technical assistance to ensure rapid progress. To that end, the measures in the joint
Greek government and European Commission Statistical Action Plan will be fully
implemented. Since January 2010, timely monthly central government budget reports
on a cash basis have been published. The General Accounting Office (GAO) will also
start publishing monthly data on expenditures pending payments, including arrears.
Efforts will also be intensified to improve the collection and processing of general
government data compiled according to ESA.


Public finance statistics–Audit powers by Eurostat over EDP-related statistics: The
problems faced in Greece go well beyond what can be tackled using only the
statistical monitoring tools available to the Commission, which according to the
Council Regulation 479/2009 does not have audit powers4. To remedy this, the
ECOFIN Council agreed legislation to give Eurostat audit powers over Member
States’ national finances. In specific cases where significant risks or problems with
the quality of data have been clearly identified, Eurostat officials will have the right
to see data from every level of government on execution of national budgets and the
accounts of corporations, non-profit institutions and other bodies that are part of the
general government sector. It is now essential that Member States take all necessary
measures to facilitate the Eurostat officials' work.



Public finance statistics–statistical consequences of the European Financial
Stabilization Mechanism (EFSM): From a statistical perspective, it will be important
to analyze the treatment of the special purpose vehicle that will be at the center of this
mechanism, in light of the international methodologies. The potential impact of the
activity of the EFSM on the fiscal data of both the Member States and the European
Aggregates (EU-27 and Euro Area) should also be assessed.



Public finance statistics–stock-flow adjustment (SFA): the main factors contributing
to changes in government debt other than government deficits are being closely
monitored by Eurostat in the context of regular quality checks of the EDP data. A
considerable increase of SFAs was observed in the EU in 2008 and 2009, reflecting
the reactions of Member States governments to the financial crisis. However, in
Eurostat’s view, SFAs have generally legitimate explanations and the fears that

4

Following the “Greek case” in 2004, and a request by the Council to strengthen the monitoring of the quality
of the reported fiscal data, the Commission proposed amendments to the existing framework for the quality of
EDP data, in particular, the establishment of in-depth monitoring visits and the requirement for Member States
to promptly provide Eurostat with access to the information required to assess data quality of the EDP-related
statistics. Council Regulations 2103/2005 and 479/2009 granted Eurostat strengthened control powers, though
more limited than initially requested by the Commission.

47
governments may have an incentive in underreporting their deficits to comply with
the EDP by reporting transactions under the SFA, seem unjustified. Moreover, the
deficit revisions that would result from a reclassification of operations on financial
derivatives would be limited.


Long-term sustainability and quality of public finances: Member States and Eurostat
should further step their efforts in the provision and dissemination of detailed data on
government expenditure by function (COFOG level II data), especially in those areas
relevant to the analysis of the quality of public finances and the allocation of
Structural Funds. In the area of pension schemes, one novelty of the 2008-SNA
concerns the comprehensive recording of pension entitlements accrued by
households. A revision of ESA to include a specific chapter on social insurance
systems is underway that will show the pension entitlements and the related
transactions for all pension schemes including for social security contributions
schemes. In the absence of legal regulations, a fully-fledged release of data is only
targeted by 2014. Regarding demographic projections, as requested by the ECOFIN
Council, comparable population projections should be available by autumn 2012, as
requested by the ECOFIN Council. These projections will be used by the Economic
Policy Committee (EPC) to estimate the budgetary implications of ageing.



Labor market statistics: A major quality review of the European LFS was conducted
in 2008-09 resulting in improvement recommendations. It is now important that
Member States follow up on this work; implementation plans are being discussed
with them.


While the relevance of the ILO concept is confirmed, there is agreement on
the need for supplementary indicators of underemployment and labor potential
outside the labor force to supplement the ILO unemployment rate.



The timeliness of the EU-LFS survey can be improved. This would further
enhance its relevance for short-term economic analysis. For this purpose, it is
essential that the twelve-week deadline in the Regulation (Council Regulation
1897/2000) is considered to apply for the final data transmission.



Regarding the coherence between LFS and national accounts employment
estimates, the key priority in this regard is to distinguish between differences
in coverage, scope and definitions from inconsistencies that can be ascribed to
the accuracy of the different statistics. For this purpose the Task Force
recommended the use of reconciliation tables between LFS and National
Accounts estimates.



The PEEIs of the labor market include monthly unemployment, the Labor
Cost Index (LCI), quarterly employment (National Accounts) and quarterly
job vacancy statistics. Member States are encouraged by Eurostat to explore

48
options to derive monthly unemployment estimates exclusively from the LFS,
as well as to move to quarterly rotational designs in the LFS with a view to
facilitating the release of information on transition processes. Although a
version of the LCI without bonuses would be welcome this is not conceived as
a priority for the time being.


Productivity data: the EU KLEMS project is meant to evolve from a research driven
project to an ESS project. Eurostat has set up actions (grants) to co-finance projects
for the implementation of statistical modules for EU KLEMS in Member States. At
the same time, Eurostat has started to explore the possible synergies between national
accounts, labor market statistics and productivity data. For instance, additional
resources are being devoted to the compilation of Input/Output tables for the euro
area. Furthermore, in line with the greener and sustainable objective established in the
Europe 2020 strategy, avenues to reorient the project to a broad multifactor
productivity perspective with an environmental dimension are being explored.
Member States should continue to enhance their efforts to improve the statistical
basis for multifactor productivity analysis.



Short-term business statistics (STS): the changeover to NACE rev. 2 is proceeding as
planned. The adoption of the new classification will nevertheless result in shorter
series for services activities for which data are not available at the required level of
disaggregation. Efforts are being stepped up to coordinate the release calendar for
STS to improve the stability of EU aggregates. Concerns remain about the application
of conventional seasonal adjustment techniques at turning points. Regarding the
Service Producer Price Indices (SPPI), only 12 out of the required 17 series are
available for EA16 at this stage, with some big euro-area members being behind
schedule. Timeliness of STS statistics improved in the last years, in particular for
PEEIs-related STS. Nevertheless some releases still lag US dissemination dates.



Housing indicators: the crisis has shown that the need to develop housing indicators.
Pilot projects with the National Statistical Institutes currently underway should
provide the necessary data for a possible inclusion of owner-occupied housing into
the HICP and harmonized house price index data at the European level. Eurostat is
preparing a legal act to insure the continuation of the project beyond its pilot phase
and lead to the inclusion of quarterly House Price Indices in the list of PEEIs.



International trade statistics: The new Intrastat Regulations reduce the reporting
burden for traders, strengthen quality requirements and introduce new statistics by
business characteristics. The revised Extrastat Regulations adapt the compilation of
external trade statistics to the new Customs environment and introduce new data
elements (e.g. nature of transaction, Member States of destination/actual exports,
currency of transaction with countries outside the euro area, etc.). A new concept of
"economic ownership" will bring in line External Trade statistics with Balance of

49
Payments and National Accounts and improve the recording of specific goods and
movements.


Europe 2020: Eurostat is involved in the methodological work around the EU
headline targets of the Europe 2020 strategy (employment rate, R&D investment,
climate and energy, education and social inclusion). Ongoing discussions center on
the choice of relevant indicators to measure social inclusion–by combining indicators
of relative and absolute poverty and the measurement of innovation to complement
the R&D indicator under Europe 2020.



Cross-cutting issues: The implementation of the revised ESA based on the System of
National Accounts 2008-SNA is planned for 2014, requiring a Commission proposal
covering methodological issues and a Transmission Program this year. The required
improvements include the effective transmission of (financial and non-financial)
balance-sheet data and data on pension schemes and R&D. In terms of timeliness,
Eurostat is moving toward a “30-60-90” approach: publishing flash data after 30
days, European aggregates and the main income, expenditure and output components
after 60 days; and the sectoral and financial sector accounts after 90 days.

Supplementary Information
Prepared by the European Department
Approved by Ajai Chopra and Martin Muhleisen
July 14, 2010
1.
This supplement provides an update of economic and policy developments since the release
of the staff report (7/1/10). The thrust of the staff appraisal remains unchanged. Also attached is a
draft background section of the Public Information Notice (PIN).
2.
Recent data confirm a continuing recovery with heightened downside risks. Real activity
has so far weathered the financial tensions in the euro area, with production and orders data
improving and the rise of unemployment decelerating (Figure 1). Developments have been mixed
across countries, however, and average gains in production have recently moderated. Business and
consumer confidence indices deteriorated markedly in May. Annual inflation fell to 1.4 percent in
June, after 1.6 percent in May.
3.
After falling sharply against major currencies, the euro exchange rate has appreciated
in recent weeks, but remains more volatile than usual. Improved investor sentiment has helped
the euro move up from its trough of early June. In real effective terms, the euro is close, if marginally
above its long-term average. The external current account is near balance, not far from an expected
small surplus in the medium term. In the current environment, assessing the fundamental value of the
euro is subject to unusually high uncertainty. With that caveat, the euro exchange rate as of July 13
appears to be close to, if still slightly above its
fundamental value as corroborated by recent CGER

Source: Fund Staff estimates
the lows reached in June and credit default spreads
of euro-area banks and sovereigns have slightly receded but remain at elevated levels (Figure 2).
Greece has managed to issue 6-month T-bills at a yield of 4.65 percent, though long-term rates
remain prohibitive. Other countries affected by market tensions have succeeded to issue across the
maturity spectrum at acceptable, if somewhat elevated yields.
5.
The redemption of the ECB’s first one-year refinancing operation went well and
purchases under the SMP have been diminishing. While the majority of banks did not reapply for

2
ECB refinancing on July 1, a significant number remain heavily reliant on ECB financing facilities.
At its policy meeting on July 8, the ECB reiterated its expectation of moderate inflation in 2011 and
left the policy rate unchanged. The total outstanding purchases under the SMP amounted to euro 60
billion on July 9. President Trichet, emphasizing that the ECB remained vigilant, noted that the need
for interventions under the SMP seemed to have diminished in view of improved functioning of
secondary markets.

6.
The EFSF is set to be fully operational by end July 2010. The EFSF framework agreement
is in force as two thirds of member states have signed off. However, completing the legal procedure
for issuing guarantee commitments for at least 90 percent of the total will take until end July, at
which point the EFSF will have the authority to issue bonds.
7.
CEBS announced that results of ongoing EU bank stress tests will be released on July
23, 2010. In line with staff recommendations, the exercise now covers a wider range of institutions
than initially envisaged, up from 25 to 91 banks representing 65 percent of the EU banking sector.
For now, markets have taken a favorable view of these stress tests, as suggested by the shrinking
premium of bank over corporate CDS spreads and a modest reduction in counterparty and liquidity
risk indicators (Figure 2). Nevertheless, some uncertainty regarding the stringency of the tests is
likely to remain. In another welcome development, several member states extended their bank debt
guarantee and recapitalization schemes and some are expected to do so in the coming days.
8.
Over the past few weeks, the Commission and the ECB made further contributions to
the ongoing debate on the reform of economic governance:
The ECB governance proposals, released on June 10, emphasize the quasi
automaticity of sanctions to bolster enforcement of the Stability and Growth Pact, more
intrusive ex-ante surveillance of macroeconomic policies, a mechanism modeled after the
Excessive (budget) Deficit Procedure to monitor and eventually correct internal (current
account) imbalances in the euro area, and a permanent crisis resolution mechanism.

The Commission Communication of June 30 fleshed out the proposals described in
the Staff Report. Most notably, it joins the ECB in proposing binding instruments to correct
internal imbalances; and, in line with staff advice, envisages binding minimum benchmarks
for national fiscal frameworks, including enforceable rules and better statistics. It also
proposes to expand the use of financial sanctions as an enforcement mechanism, including
through the suspension of certain commitments from the EU budget (e.g. transfers from
cohesion funds or CAP reimbursements to national budgets) in case of excessive deficit and
an immediate suspension of the related payments in case of non-compliance. The July 12
meeting of the Council task force endorsed this approach. The Communication also provides
a detailed time line for the early peer review of budget plans and reform programs, on which
the ECOFIN Council of July 13, 2010 requested specific implementation proposals.

Next step. The Commission will transpose these proposals into draft amendments to
secondary legislation by end-September, based on existing Treaty provisions mandating
economic policy coordination (Article 121) and authorizing the Council to create new instruments
of enhanced coordination in the euro area (Article 136).

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation on
Euro Area Policies
On July 19, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV Consultation on Euro Area Policies.1
Background
The euro area’s sovereign crisis was largely caused by unsustainable policies in some member
countries, which came to a head in early May 2010. Facing increasing turmoil, the ECB stepped
up liquidity and credit support aimed at avoiding market instability. New European financing
instruments were created to assist EU members facing difficulties in accessing capital markets,
but have thus far not been used.
Already prior to the sovereign crisis, the staff expected the euro area to be slow to recover, with
headwinds from uncertainty about the strength of the financial system, ongoing deleveraging of
private sector balance sheets, and time needed to improve competitiveness, and reallocate
resources to tradable sectors in some countries. Furthermore, despite employment-support
measures in many countries, uncertainty about job prospects has been weighing on household
demand. High-frequency indicators are consistent with a relatively strong second quarter in
2010, driven by the global recovery in trade and manufacturing, and some slowing of
momentum during the second half of 2010. Disinflationary pressures persist in the face of weak
domestic demand, with the sizeable output gap shrinking only gradually. Staff projects inflation
to remain well below 2 percent over the relevant policy horizon.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2

The aggregate fiscal position of the euro area has deteriorated sharply in 2009. Many member
countries allowed automatic stabilizers full play and implemented fiscal stimulus measures
aimed at supporting private consumption, limiting increases in unemployment, and raising public
investment. These policies mitigated the impact of the crisis, but together with bank support
came with a rise in average euro area government debt. Current deficit targets imply a neutral
aggregate fiscal stance in 2010 and synchronized consolidations, gradually leading to deficits
below the SGP limit by 2013 in most cases. However, additional efforts will be needed to
stabilize debt dynamics over the long term.
Amid considerable volatility interbank bank CDS spreads remain somewhat elevated and some
banks persistently rely on liquidity and other government support. Stress tests are underway
with the aim to assess the resilience of the euro area’s financial system, increase transparency
to reduce counterparty risks, and identify banks with capital needs.
Individual euro area member current account deficits and surpluses and their persistence since
the advent of EMU has been partly reversed by the recent crisis, but remain significant.
Equilibrium phenomena, such as different demographics and long-term growth dynamics justify
some imbalance, but the major drivers were to be found in unsustainable credit and
construction booms, a lack of fiscal restraint, and unsustainable wage developments.
The current crisis has triggered a debate about how to close the fundamental gaps in the euro
area’s governance framework. The authorities have tabled several proposals to strengthen
fiscal surveillance, focusing on more intrusive ex-ante surveillance, more effective sanctions,
and minimum benchmarks for national frameworks. They have also proposed similar
procedures to strengthen surveillance over internal imbalances. Meanwhile, member states are
in the process of building up the EU’s financial stability architecture, focused on establishing
new European supervisory institutions, including a systemic risk board, and harmonizing the
approach to resolution.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal. Noting that the euro area is being affected
by a sovereign debt crisis with repercussions well beyond its borders, Directors emphasized the
need for strong policy implementation across fiscal, financial, and structural policy areas to
support the recovery and limit adverse spillovers. They welcomed the far-reaching crisis
response and underscored that, while the newly created tools should be used as needed, they
should not be considered an alternative to the necessary policy corrections and structural
reforms.
Directors observed that the heightened sovereign risks have imparted further downside risks to
an already moderate and uneven recovery. Over the medium term, Directors saw fiscal
consolidation and structural rigidities weighing on the recovery, only partly offset by the recent
depreciation of the exchange rate to a level that is now close to its fundamental value.
Directors welcomed the measures currently being undertaken and the heightened intent to
tackle structural issues. They saw three essential areas for policy actions to help establish a
durable recovery:

3



First, weaknesses in the banking system, with some banks overly reliant on liquidity or
other government support, need to be addressed. Directors welcomed the authorities’
intention to use transparent stress tests with an expanded coverage in terms of
institutions and risks to help restore confidence in the financial system. They
underscored the need to make resources available to recapitalize viable institutions
lacking market access and restructure others. A clarification of new capital and liquidity
requirements for banks, consistent across countries and appropriately phased in, would
be important.



Second, Directors agreed that fiscal consolidation is essential, with its speed and scope
tailored to each country’s circumstances. They highlighted the importance of the quality
and composition of fiscal consolidation and noted that entitlement reforms will be
particularly effective in helping ensure medium-term fiscal sustainability.



Third, Directors encouraged the timely implementation of structural reforms, especially in
the labor and product markets, to lift the euro area’s tepid growth potential.

Directors welcomed the ECB’s Securities Market Program and the reinstatement of some other
non-standard measures to secure effective transmission of the monetary policy stance.
Directors saw long-term inflation expectations well anchored, keeping risks to price stability at
bay. Hence, they noted that the policy rate remains appropriately low.
Directors encouraged the authorities to strengthen economic governance of EMU to deliver the
collective responsibility necessary for a well-functioning economic and monetary union, which
would help prevent future crises. They welcomed the recent proposals by the authorities in
areas including budgetary policies and competitiveness. Directors pointed to the need for better
enforcement of budgetary discipline and the extension of effective surveillance over key
structural reforms.
Directors encouraged further progress in building the EU’s financial stability architecture. They
welcomed the steps taken toward a more harmonized regulation and supervision of the EU
financial system. The establishment of a core set of effective resolution tools would raise the
scope for coordination in the resolution of cross-border institutions.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program

Statement by Klaus Stein, Executive Director for Germany,
on behalf of the Euro Area Authorities,
July 19, 2010

In my capacity as President of EURIMF, I submit this Buff statement on the Article IV
consultation with the euro area. It reflects the common view of the Member States of the
euro area and the European Union in their respective fields of competence. The
authorities of the euro area Member States are grateful for open and fruitful consultations
with the Fund staff and for their constructive policy advice. The authorities broadly
concur with the staff’s findings. However we are astonished how reluctant the report is in
recognizing achievements compared to reports on other major economic areas.
Short-term economic outlook
A gradual recovery is in progress in the euro area after the deep economic recession came
to an end in the third quarter of last year. The turnaround was driven in large part by the
exceptional crisis measures put in place by authorities in the euro area, in the EU and
outside.
The normalization of the financial situation in the euro area was interrupted by a severe
sovereign debt crisis caused by an exceptional combination of adverse economic and
policy factors in Greece. In response, Member States agreed on a package of bold
measures to preserve financial stability in Europe: the European Financial Stabilization
Mechanism (EFSM) and the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF). The practical
arrangements concerning the establishment of the European Financial Stability Facility
are well on track and the Facility is expected to be fully operational by the end of July. In
parallel with the creation of the financial instruments, the Member States experiencing
particular market stress committed to accelerate fiscal consolidation and structural
reforms, while the European Central Bank introduced the Securities Market Program.
Turning to the real economy, the euro area is benefiting from a strong external
environment and inventory restocking, whereas weak domestic demand components
continue to restrain the recovery. Investment is held back by the still relatively low level
of capacity utilization, deleveraging and heightened risk aversion. Consumption growth is
primarily constrained by weak wage and employment growth. The smaller-than-expected
impact of the economic crisis on the euro area labor market is explained by past measures
taken to enhance market flexibility combined with the use of short-term measures and, in
some Member States, by labor hoarding. The remaining slack in the economy keeps wage
growth and inflation in check. The speed of recovery is varying across euro area Member
States, reflecting their individual circumstances and the policies they pursue.
Looking ahead, the authorities broadly concur with the forecast presented by the staff and
expect the euro-area economy to grow by about 1% in 2010 and 1½% in 2011. The
authorities see the risks broadly balanced, though the probability of downside risks has
increased compared to the Commission’s Spring Forecast.

Monetary policy and the outlook for price stability
The euro area annual HICP inflation stood at 1.4% in June, but is expected to display
further volatility in the next few months, with a tendency to somewhat higher rates later
this year. The inflation rates in 2011 should remain moderate, benefiting from low
domestic price pressure. Risks to the outlook for inflation are broadly balanced. The
underlying pace of monetary expansion is moderate, as annual growth rate of bank loans
to the private sector is still weak, with positive growth in loans to households and
negative growth to non-financial corporations. Against this background, the current key
ECB interest rates remain appropriate.
As regards ECB’s non-standard measures, with bond market tensions intensifying in
April and especially in the early days of May this year in some euro area countries, and
spreading to other markets and countries, on May 10, 2010, the ECB re-introduced some
non-standard measures that had been withdrawn, such as six-month refinancing operation
with full allotment. Furthermore, a Securities Markets Program (SMP) was introduced,
implying Eurosystem interventions in private and public bond markets. Its aim is to
address the malfunctioning of some securities markets, and restore an appropriate
monetary policy transmission mechanism. Following the introduction of the program,
bond spreads of euro area countries generally have declined, though still standing at
elevated levels. All non-standard measures, including the SMP, are by construction
temporary in nature.
Turning to money markets, the maturing of the first 1-year Long-Term Refinancing
Operation (EUR 442 bn) at the end of June went smoothly, as banks had been given the
opportunity to refinance themselves in other operations with full allotment. With banks
choosing to refinance less than the maturing amount, excess liquidity in the money
market decreased somewhat, causing short-term interest rates such as the overnight
interest rate (EONIA) to rise slightly, though still standing close to the interest rate on the
ECB deposit facility.
Fiscal policy
The euro area authorities share the staff assessment on the broad neutrality of the fiscal
stance in the euro area in 2010 and the need for the stance to become clearly restrictive as
from 2011. However, in some countries the challenges regarding sustainability were
exacerbated by financial market tensions, requiring strengthened consolidation efforts
already in 2010, despite the prospects of only moderate recovery, in order to secure fiscal
sustainability and to limit contagion effects.
The euro area authorities agree with the staff that the overall objective should be for
fiscal consolidation efforts to be supportive of the economic recovery. As underlined by
the staff, this can be made possible by focusing on structural expenditure reduction as
well as improved streamlining of public expenditure programs. Pension reforms would
also strengthen long-term commitment to sound public finances. However, the euro area
authorities note that fiscal adjustment plans also need to be tailored to country-specific
situations as indicated in the Orientations for fiscal policies in the euro area Member

States issued on June 7, 2010 by euro-area Finance Ministers. A coordinated
differentiation in the speed of consolidation is warranted by frontloading consolidation in
a number of Member States in order to avoid adverse debt dynamics, also taking in to
account macro-financial stability considerations. Additional measures should be
implemented in 2011 and beyond, where and when necessary, in order to ensure the
achievement of the budgetary targets and to underpin the credibility of consolidation
strategies. For the credibility of fiscal consolidation in all Member States it is essential
that the measures adopted are of a permanent nature and embedded in a comprehensive
strategy of structural reforms. Concerning the composition of adjustment, the magnitude
of the required corrections means that it is likely that a combination of spending and tax
measures will be necessary. While expenditure-based consolidations are in general
preferable in order to limit medium to long-term adverse effects on growth and to
reinforce credibility, tax increases may also assist in achieving structural fiscal
adjustment objectives.

State of the banking sector
The sovereign crisis in the euro area led to renewed stress in the banking sector, as many
banks are exposed to sovereign risks and market participants started questioning the
solvency of some segments of the euro-area banking system. Although most of the euro
area’s large banking groups returned to modest profitability in 2009 and their capital
positions increased to above pre-crisis levels, credit risk is still considered to be the most
important risk for the banking sector in most of the Member States. The increasing
tension was quickly mirrored in tightening money market conditions and higher funding
costs. These developments signal that trust among banks remains fragile as long as there
are doubts about the solvency of the potential counterparts.
Since the outbreak of the financial crisis the EU has taken significant measures to support
the banking sector, including:


guarantee schemes – the approximate volume of guarantees authorized by the
Commission until 31 March 2010 under schemes amounts to € 2 747 billion and
ad hoc guarantees to a total of € 402.8 billion;



recapitalization schemes – the total volume of approved recapitalization measures
(both schemes and ad hoc cases) by the end of March 2010 stood at € 503.1
billion, which corresponds to around 4% of EU GDP, whereas the amount
effectively used was € 241.6 billion or 2% of EU GDP;



impaired asset measures – the nominal amount of total assets covered by the asset
relief interventions reached € 376 billion;



restructuring plans.

As the staff noted, keeping support to the financial sector at current levels in place for too
long would allow banks with structural problems to unduly postpone the necessary
restructuring and could lead to growing competition distortions. The return to normal
market conditions is important for a sustained recovery. It is essential, therefore, that
banks accelerate balance sheet repair to minimize the need for government intervention.
In this respect, transparency in the existing quality of bank balances would encourage the
distressed institutions to restructure and would help to lift doubts about the soundness of
the financial system as a whole.
The staff is right to emphasize the role of stress tests in this context. The authorities
consider that the extended coverage as well as the planned publication of the CEBS stress
test will be a crucial step. The objective of this extended exercise is to assess the overall
resilience of the EU banking sector and the banks’ ability to absorb further possible
shocks on credit and market risks, including sovereign risks, and to assess the current
dependence on public support. The exercise is being conducted on a bank-by-bank basis,
using commonly agreed macro-economic scenarios for 2010 and 2011.
The macro-economic scenarios, which include a set of key macro-economic variables,
envisage adverse conditions in financial markets and a shock on interest rates to capture
an increase in risk premia linked to a deterioration in the EU government bond markets.
The scope of the stress testing exercise has been extended to include key domestic credit
institutions in Europe, in addition to the major EU cross-border banking groups. In each
EU Member State at least 50% of the national banking sector, in terms of total assets, is
covered. Banking groups have been tested on a consolidated level. This means that
subsidiaries and branches of an EU cross-border banking group have been included in the
exercise as a part of the test of the group as a whole. For the EU, the 91 banks covered
represent 65% of the EU banking sector.
Financial regulation
The European Commission and the EU governments initiated numerous regulatory
reforms in the financial sector, which have been an integral part of the responses to the
crisis. The Commission's communication on "Regulating Financial Services for
sustainable growth" of June 2, 2010 takes stock of the ongoing initiatives and lists the
initiatives to be undertaken and completed before the end of 2011. The initiatives cover
the issues highlighted by the staff and largely go in the indicated directions.
In particular, on July 8, the European Parliament approved amendments to the Capital
Requirements Directive (“CRD 3”) as regards capital requirements for trading book and
for securitization, and the supervisory review of remuneration policies. Further possible
changes to the Capital Requirement Directive (“CRD 4”) are underway. The proposed
amendments relate to liquidity standards, definition of capital, leverage ratio,
counterparty credit risk, counter-cyclical measures including through-the-cycle
provisioning for expected credit losses, systematically important financial institutions and
single rule book in banking. This legislative proposal will be presented by the
Commission this autumn and will mirror the revisions proposed under Basel III.
Following on the regulation on credit rating agencies adopted in 2009, the Commission

proposed on June 2, 2010 a draft regulation amending this legislation and setting up a
direct and a centralized EU oversight of the rating agencies by the future European
Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), planned to be established in 2011. The
Commission also intends to propose by next fall additional measures to strengthen
competition in the credit rating market and to reduce excessive regulatory reliance on
credit rating in the financial system. The EU is also currently working on a complete set
of tools on crisis prevention and management. In October 2010, the Commission will
publish an action plan on crisis management, leading to legislative proposals for a
complete set of tools for prevention, management and resolution of failing banks.
Discussions continue on the new supervisory framework in the EU. It is expected that the
legislative process in the European Parliament and the Council will be concluded in
September and the new institutions will become operational at the beginning of 2011.
Structural reform and growth
The authorities concur with the staff that a key challenge is to promote policy strategies
that create growth and employment, restore sustainability of public finances and at the
same time address the long-term challenges of globalization, ageing and climate change.
This is the objective of the Europe 2020 strategy, on which a political agreement was
reached by the European Council of June 2010. The strategy is designed to promote
reforms in various areas, such as employment-boosting reforms of the labor market,
reforms of the research and education systems, measures to promote "green" growth, and
product market reforms. The strategy also encompasses reforms directly aimed at
improving quality of government expenditure that can have immediate and longer-term
positive fiscal impact (for example, raising effective retirement ages and reform of agerelated expenditure, such as healthcare) as well as boosting revenues. As to the short term
focus of the Europe 2020 strategy, priority should be given to frontloading reforms that
bolster jobs and growth but have no or positive budgetary impact (e.g. regulatory
measures) or which strengthen fiscal sustainability over the long run (e.g. pension
reforms). Credible commitments now to implement growth-enhancing reforms in the
medium term could also boost confidence, and through expectations of stronger fiscal
positions translate into lower risk premia.
The June ECOFIN Council endorsed a report identifying the main bottlenecks to
sustainable growth, which specifies areas in each Member State where structural reforms
are necessary to remove the bottlenecks that constrain sustainable growth. Proposals on
the enhanced governance arrangements are being elaborated, providing for a more
comprehensive, integrated and effective approach to economic policy co-ordination.
Also, improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the EU budget through stronger
prioritization and better alignment of EU expenditure with Europe 2020 goals will be
discussed in the context of the upcoming EU budget review and the next multi-annual
financial framework. The Commission is going to outline concrete proposals in autumn.
Intra-euro-area imbalances
The authorities recognize that competitiveness divergences and underlying imbalances
are a matter of common importance for euro area Member States and warrant appropriate

and timely policy measures. In March 2010, the Eurogroup committed to address the
issue of competitiveness divergences and macroeconomic imbalances swiftly and
effectively and to put in place an ambitious and comprehensive policy response covering
appropriate measures in four broad areas: budgetary and wage policies, labor markets,
goods and services markets and the financial sector. Moreover, the Ministers committed
to make sure that the agreed policy response is coordinated in the euro area, designed to
address the specific vulnerabilities and needs of each country and facilitates the smooth
functioning of the EMU.
As rightly pointed out by the staff, action is required in all euro area Member States, but
the nature, importance and urgency of the policy challenges differ significantly
depending on the countries considered. Given vulnerabilities and the magnitude of the
adjustment required, the need for policy action is particularly pressing in Member States
showing persistently large current-account deficits and large competitiveness losses.
Economic governance
The global economic crisis has shown that the current mechanisms of economic policy
coordination and surveillance need to be strengthened. The authorities have therefore
embarked on a comprehensive debate on the improvement of economic policy
coordination in the euro area and in the EU as a whole. In line with proposals by the
Commission, the European Council of June 17, 2010 endorsed a first set of orientations
as regards budgetary and broader macroeconomic surveillance. The European Council
also invited the Task Force on economic governance chaired by the President of the
European Council and the Commission to rapidly develop further these orientations and
make them operational.
Surveillance under the new framework will incorporate areas such as macro-economic
imbalances that were hitherto not systematically part of surveillance. Also, surveillance
will henceforth be conducted in an integrated fashion, meaning that the reporting on
fiscal policy under the Stability and Growth Pact on the one hand and the reporting on
macroeconomic imbalances and macro-relevant structural reforms will occur
simultaneously. This alignment in time will mean that the basis for the policy guidance
will be a fully integrated analysis across policy areas for each Member State.
Within fiscal surveillance the European Council agreed to strengthen the preventive and
corrective arms of the SGP, with sanctions attached to the consolidation path towards the
medium term objective; to give much more prominent role to debt and overall
sustainability; to ensure that all Member States have national budgetary rules and
medium term budgetary frameworks in line with the Stability and Growth Pact; and to
ensure the quality of statistical data by making statistical offices fully independent for
data provision.
In order to safeguard macroeconomic stability and to prevent harmful macroeconomic
imbalances, the Council agreed to develop a scoreboard to better assess competitiveness
developments and imbalances in Member States and to allow for an early detection of
unsustainable trends. The Council also called for developing an effective surveillance

framework, reflecting the particular situation of euro area Member States. Moreover, as
of 2011 all strands of surveillance will be coordinated together in the first half of the year
in order to give clear ex ante guidance for all economic policies, and especially fiscal
policy, on the national level in the second half of the year.
