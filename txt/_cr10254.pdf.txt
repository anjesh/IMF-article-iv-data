Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on Spain
July 14, 2010
1.
This statement updates the staff report (SM/10/148) and supplement for the
decree-law reforming the legal and regulatory regime for saving banks approved by the
government on July 9. The decree-law goes in the direction advocated by staff and does not
change the thrust of the report.
2.

The main elements of the reform are:



Allowing “cuotas participativas” (equity-like instruments issued by savings banks)
to have voting rights and removing the five percent limit on an individual investor’s
holding.



Giving savings banks the option to: (1) maintain their existing structure; (2) operate
through a bank; (3) become part of a formal group of savings banks (Sistema
Institucional de Protección, “SIP”) with a commercial bank as the central entity; or
(4) change their legal nature and become a foundation and a (potentially minority)
shareholder of the bank to which it transfers its business.



Altering corporate governance structures, including: (1) reducing the maximum
voting rights for public entities’ from 50 percent to 40 percent; (2) prohibiting elected
officials to be members of governing bodies; and (3) strengthening reputation and
experience criteria.

3.
Staff’s preliminary assessment of the reform is positive, although further
enhancement of some aspects would be beneficial. The assessment is preliminary as it is
based on the summary of the decree-law (as the full text had not been published by 12 July).
In terms of the objectives outlined by staff, the decree-law enhances the ability of savings
banks to raise external capital, offers an opportunity to transform into a stock-holding
company, and reduces political influence. However, some elements remain that could limit
the attractiveness of savings banks to potential investors: the 50 percent limit on the total
amount of cuotas participativas a saving bank can issue is maintained, and, similarly, the
capital participation of saving banks in a SIP cannot fall below 50 percent, although the
possibility envisaged in the decree-law for savings banks to transform into foundations and
transfer their banking activity to a bank would effectively allow these limits to be exceeded.
Also, systemically important savings banks are not required to transform into joint-stock
companies.

(In Consultation with Other Departments)
Approved by Ajai Chopra and Martin Mühleisen
June 29, 2010
1.
Significant policy developments have occurred since the Staff Report was issued.
While they go in the direction advocated by staff and do not change the thrust of the report,
they do affect staff’s appraisal of the relevant policy areas.
Labor market reform
2.
On June 16, the government approved a decree-law reforming the labor market.
The decree was approved by parliament and entered into force on June 22. It will undergo a
review process to be converted into law. The main elements of the reform are:


the reduction of severance pay to 33 days per year of tenure for unfair dismissal
(previously 45 days was the norm) for almost all new permanent contracts;



financing 8 days of all severance payments via a fund paid for by firms;



easing the criteria for “fair” dismissal (which would entail 20 days severance
payment); and,



broadening the conditions under which firms can opt-out of collective wage
agreements.

Other reforms include: tightening conditions for temporary contracts; increasing internal
flexibility of firms (e.g., working hours); and, opening labor intermediation more broadly to
private firms.
3.
Although the reform has many positive aspects that will improve the working of
the labor market, there is scope for further strengthening. Notably, severance pay
remains above EU average levels and it is not clear whether the easing of criteria for fair
dismissal and procedures for opt-outs is sufficient to have a substantial impact – much
depends on how the courts interpret the new provisions. More generally, effective
decentralization of wage setting to firms will likely require a change in the collective
bargaining process, which is currently under review by the social partners. The government
should thus take every opportunity to deliver the required radical overhaul, including during
the passage of the decree-law through parliament and the review of the wage bargaining
system.

Banking sector stress tests and consolidation
4.
Governor Ordóñez announced on June 16 the Bank of Spain’s intention to
publish bank-by-bank results of stress tests. Staff welcomes this intention, which should
enhance transparency and underpin market confidence. It will be important that the stress
tests are based on sufficiently conservative assumptions and accompanied by a clear strategy
to recapitalize and restructure those institutions with capital shortfalls identified by the stress
tests.
5.
The process of consolidating savings banks has accelerated as staff had
recommended. As of mid-June, 2010, 12 merger/integrations were underway, involving 38
savings banks, comprising 92 percent of the assets of the savings bank sector, thus covering
almost the entire system. Staff welcomes this development, and it will be important to ensure
that the process reduces overcapacity and enhances cost efficiency as envisaged.

Staff Report for the 2010 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by Staff Representatives for the 2010 Consultation with Spain
(in consultation with other departments)
Approved by Ajai Chopra and Martin Mühleisen
June 29, 2010

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 1/
Context: The necessary adjustment is underway and output has stabilized. Imbalances
accumulated during the long boom have begun to unwind, though unemployment has
soared. The recovery is likely to be weak and fragile, with significant downside risks.
Challenges: Spain’s economy needs far-reaching and comprehensive reforms. The
challenges are severe: a dysfunctional labor market, the deflating property bubble, a large
fiscal deficit, heavy private sector and external indebtedness, anemic productivity growth,
weak competitiveness, a banking sector with pockets of weakness, and difficult financial
market conditions.
Policies and staff views: Ambitious fiscal consolidation is underway. But it is based on
potentially optimistic macroeconomic projections and the achievement of the targets
should be made more credible. A bold pension reform, along the lines originally proposed
by the government, should be quickly adopted. This needs to be complemented with
growth-enhancing structural reforms, especially overhauling the labor market.
Consolidation and reform of the banking system needs to be accelerated. Such a
comprehensive strategy, especially with broad political and social support, would underpin
investor confidence, and time is of the essence.
Authorities’ views: The recovery is likely to be stronger than staff envisage, boosted by
rebounding private consumption and buoyant exports. Fiscal policy is on track to achieve
the ambitious targets and any slippage would be promptly met with additional measures.
Significant labor market reform is likely in the coming weeks, and pension reform is
underway. Savings bank consolidation, which should also be complete in the coming
weeks, will substantially reduce banking sector pressures.
1/ Significant policy developments occurred after this Staff Report had been issued to the Board, which are
discussed in the attached Staff Statement and Staff Supplement.

I. SPAIN AND THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS
A. Spain’s Challenges
1.
Spain’s economy faces severe challenges. Spain’s economic cycle was already
turning and its long-standing imbalances beginning to unwind when the global crisis hit,
turning the soft landing hard (Figures 1 and 2):


The crisis has taken a heavy toll on the labor market. Despite a similar output fall as
elsewhere in the euro area, unemployment soared to 20 percent, double the euro area
average. Beyond the heavy social toll, this puts pressure on the fiscal accounts and the
banks, and erodes human capital.



The deflating property bubble compounds the effects of the global financial crisis.
Because the real estate boom involved a large volume increase (unlike in the UK) and
housing price adjustment has been slow, construction output and employment have
contracted sharply.



Spain has exhausted its fiscal space. The combination of a large stimulus and
evaporating cyclical and one-off revenues yielded one of the largest deficit increases
in the euro area.



The economy is highly indebted. During the boom, households and corporations
borrowed heavily, resulting in Spain incurring one of the most negative International
Investment Positions among advanced countries.



Productivity growth and competitiveness are weak. Anemic productivity growth,
despite high investment ratios, and rapid wage increases led to substantial rises in unit
labor costs and contributed to large current account deficits.



Part of the banking sector is fragile. The banking system relied heavily on wholesale
borrowing to fund domestic lending to the real estate sector and witnessed a rapid
growth of “cajas” – unlisted mutual savings banks without formal owners and share
capital and particularly exposed to local property markets – which generated
overcapacity in the system.

Financial market tensions also increased sharply in the wake of the Greek crisis.

after the announcement of the European Financial Stabilization Mechanism and the ECB’s
Securities Market program to reduce excessive volatility in sovereign debt markets. However,
conditions have since then trended negatively and many measures of sovereign risk are back
at levels prevailing just before the announcement of the Stabilization Mechanism. This is also
reflected in restricted access for Spanish banks to wholesale funding markets. Given Spain’s
systemic importance, this underscores that tackling Spain’s economic challenges and
strengthening market confidence is critical first and foremost for Spain but also for Europe
and the global economy.
3.
The combination of these challenges makes Spain’s recovery from the crisis
particularly difficult, though mitigated by some pre-existing strengths. Some of these
challenges were masked by the previous boom and the abundant global liquidity. Others are
mitigated by strong policy settings and initially healthy starting points, such as the history of
fiscal surpluses, relatively low public debt, strong policy credibility, the investment-grade
government debt rating, the prudent financial supervision framework, and banks’ high capital
and provision buffers. But the underlying structural weaknesses left Spain poorly placed to
face the global crisis and now hinder the adjustment process and undermine growth prospects.
B. Global Financial Crisis Impact: Large, Despite a Pro-active Policy Response
4.
Despite its retail-oriented business model, the banking system came under
pressure. With wholesale funding drying up, Spanish banks scaled up their use of ECB
refinancing facilities (now broadly in line with Euro- Savings banks' prof its contracted more markedly

actively, including through debt-for-property swaps and debt restructuring, to mitigate the
buildup of delinquencies. Banking sector profits contracted markedly and turned negative in
the last quarter of 2009 before recovering in the first quarter of 2010. Nonetheless, leading
Spanish banks, including the largest savings banks, have expanded overseas into UK, US and
Asian markets and through their local subsidiaries were able to support credit in Latin
America during the peak of the global financial crisis.

5.

The impact of the crisis differed greatly among banks:



The two largest banks, Santander and BBVA, preserved reasonable operating
profitability, owing to their international diversification, and were able to strengthen the
level and quality of their capital. However, the share price recovery of 2009 had partly
corrected by early 2010 and CDS spreads have lately trended upward partially
reflecting increasing sovereign risk (Figure 4).



Small commercial banks posted still positive profits mainly reflecting an increase in
net interest margins. However, the negative economic environment and the expected
pressure on margins are weighing on their outlook.



Savings banks have suffered the most given their real estate exposure, although the
sector is marked by substantial heterogeneity. Two small savings banks, comprising a
total of 1½ percent of total assets of the banking sector, were intervened by Banco de
España (BdE) in March 2009 and in May 2010. Some savings banks have also relied
heavily on official liquidity support and government guarantees. Although at different
stages of finalization, 11 mergers/integrations, comprising 34 institutions and
accounting for more than a third of the banking sector, are underway.

6.
The authorities pursued a two-stage approach to ease financial sector stress. At
the start of the crisis, the focus was on securing funding. The government established a fund
to purchase high-quality securities issued by credit institutions (Fondo de Adquisición de
Activos Financieros—FAAF) and provided guarantees for credit institutions’ new debt issues.
As the deteriorating operating environment and the collapse of the property market increased
pressure on domestic banks’ capital, the emphasis shifted to consolidation and
recapitalization and the government created the Fund for Orderly Bank Restructuring (Fondo
de Reestructuración Ordenada Bancaria—FROB), to provide temporary capital assistance to
merging credit institutions. While fine-tuning conservative provisioning rules to take into
account collateral (with haircuts), the BdE tightened allowances on repossessed assets to
prompt their rapid dismissal. Further revisions, including a unified and accelerated
provisioning schedule, were published for consultation on May 26, 2010.

7
7.
The fiscal accounts deteriorated sharply, reflecting the large stimulus. With the
crisis, the incipient deterioration in the fiscal accounts accelerated as revenue-rich real estate
collapsed, automatic stabilizers kicked in, and the large stimulus package took effect. The
general government deficit swung from a surplus of 2 percent of GDP in 2007 to a deficit of
11.2 percent of GDP in 2009, sparking widening spreads and ratings downgrades (Figures 5
and 6, and Table 4). Stimulus measures amounted to some 7 percent of GDP over 2008‒09,
well above other euro area countries. Expenditure measures focused mostly on temporary
measures, including broadening social protection and increasing public investment. On the
revenue side, tax reductions largely did not have an expiry date, though many were later
reversed. In addition, the government has taken measures to support credit lines to firms,
especially SMEs, and housing, notably through a facility to refinance mortgages of
unemployed or households with financial difficulties.

8.
The recession has been sharp and longer than elsewhere. Cushioned from the full
extent of the global financial crisis, the property bust and private sector deleveraging by the
strength of the banking sector and the large fiscal response, output fell somewhat less than
the euro area average (Figure 7, Table 1). Yet the output decline was still very substantial,
and was driven by sharp declines in investment, exports, and private consumption, with
weaker imports and rising government demand providing some offset. Imbalances have been
correcting, with domestic demand contracting much more sharply than in the euro area, and
net exports improving substantially. The hardest hit sectors were industry and
construction/real estate (Box 1). The recession ended in the first quarter, when output grew
by 0.1 percent, quarter-on-quarter (Figure 8).

8
Box 1. How Much Further Has The Property Bubble to Deflate?
EMU and euro adoption led to a large property boom, both in prices and supply. At their peak in
2007, prices were some 20‒30 percent above their long-run equilibrium. Unlike some other countries
with sharp increases in property prices (e.g. the United Kingdom), supply also responded sharply,
with construction comprising about 9½ percent of GDP in 2007 compared to a euro area average of
5½ percent. The ensuing correction in prices has been somewhat less rapid than in other countries that
had a similar boom, with “official” real prices only down about 13 percent since the peak, suggesting
at least another 10 percent still to fall. However, other price series (asking prices, prices of second
hand properties) suggest that the “true” market price may have fallen by more, as transactions have
been few, banks have been taking over property rather than selling it, and the official index is based
on assessments by private appraisal companies, which may be overestimated. Recent stabilization
may also be driven by temporary factors, such as the increase in the VAT rate from July and the
removal of mortgage interest relief for most taxpayers from next year. There is also considerable
variation in price declines, with coastal areas more heavily affected. The new supply of property is
however adjusting strongly, with the annual housing finishes running at about 425,000 units and new
housing permits at 111,000 units compared to 650,000 units for both finishes and permits in 2007.
An “overhang” of property at some 700,000 units and an equilibrium demand for property of 400,000
units, would imply another two to three years before supply conditions normalize.

led unemployment to soar to

9
20 percent, affecting mostly temporary workers and youth. Labor force participation started
falling. Spain has the highest sensitivity of unemployment to output growth among advanced
economies – partly related to the large share of temporary workers. The flip side, however, is
that unlike in other euro area countries which have lower employment losses, productivity
improved and helped narrow the gap in unit labor costs. Wages have started moderating
recently with the conclusion of a three-year wage agreement between social partners.
10.
The product market, in contrast, has been adjusting in prices. Inflation dropped
quickly into negative territory and below the euro area average, reflecting the sharp drop in
oil prices, Spain’s high energy intensity, and collapsing demand (Figure 10). Although
headline inflation has since risen back in line with the euro area, for the first time in many
years, core inflation is persistently below the euro area average, even for services. The higher
price flexibility may well reflect the strong deregulation of product markets of recent years.
With rising labor costs and declining prices however, profit margins have been squeezed and
bankruptcies have surged.
11.
Private sector imbalances have begun to correct, though debt levels remain high.

potential growth, despite some (likely cyclical) rebound in productivity.

The outlook is particularly uncertain. On the upside, household consumption could

the weaker euro may induce faster export growth. On the downside, two key risks threaten:

The political context may also prove challenging. Although general elections are
not due until 2012, local elections are due in 2011 and the governing socialist party does not
have a majority. Indeed the May fiscal package was only passed with a margin of one vote.
Many of the regions, which are especially autonomous in Spain, are controlled by the
opposition.
Authorities’ views
16.
The government sees a significant recovery, especially in outer years. Growth is
seen as rebounding more strongly from 2011 onward, reaching 2.7 percent by 2013 with the
output gap closing by 2014. This rebound is driven chiefly by:




Stronger export growth, reflecting continued
dynamism of Spanish exports, including in
expanding to markets outside the euro area.
Stronger household consumption, as the savings
ratio falls back more quickly (though remaining
above historical averages) and supported by
strengthening household financial wealth.

The BdE’s forecast for growth in 2011 is more in line
with that of staff, with lower private consumption and
export growth than the Ministry of Economy and Finance.

III. THE POLICY AGENDA: REBALANCING THE ECONOMY AND BOOSTING CONFIDENCE1
17.
Policy should focus on fostering the smooth rebalancing of the economy. This
calls for quick and decisive action on:


fiscal consolidation and pension reform to put public finances on a sustainable footing;



making the labor market more flexible to promote employment and its reallocation
across sectors; and



banking sector consolidation and reform to cement the soundness and confidence in
the financial system.

18.
Such broad reforms in many sectors simultaneously would produce synergies.
For example, labor market reform coupled with further liberalization of product and service
markets would boost investment and employment and reduce prices, making fiscal

discussed in the attached Staff Statement and Staff Supplement.

13
consolidation easier and strengthening banks. Such reforms would also support Spain’s longterm convergence with higher-income peers.
19.
The heightened risks Spain faces, and the heavy costs for Spain and others
should they materialize, make these reforms especially urgent. In such conditions, it is
imperative to “get ahead” of markets with a pro-active, comprehensive, and credible strategy.
Failure to do would result in a much worse outcome eventually and pressure to continuously
react to market developments in the meantime. The particularly high cost of policy delay in
these circumstances, and not just for Spain, underscores the need for Spain to do its utmost to
secure market confidence. This would be greatly helped by broad political and social support
for such a far-reaching strategy.
20.
Other countries have overcome similar challenges from very difficult starting
positions with comprehensive policy packages. Canada, Australia, United Kingdom,
New Zealand, Ireland, and the Netherlands all have undertaken path-breaking fiscal and
structural reforms in the 1980s and 1990s. Indeed, Spain itself has reduced real wages in its
pre-euro past, substantially reformed its economy and public finances in the run up to EU and
euro entry. Empirical evidence also suggests that recoveries from economic crises often serve
as an opportunity for reform and that it is best to undertake them with broad-based support.
Again, examples from other countries can help, such as independent commissions to set the
agenda (France’s Attali Commission and Australia’s Productivity Commission) or monitor
public finances (Sweden’s Fiscal Policy Council), and pacts with social partners (the
Netherlands’ Wassenaar agreements).
A. Fiscal Policy: Making the Consolidation More Credible
Near and medium-term outlook
21.
Spain has started ambitious fiscal consolidation to reach the 3 percent of GDP
deficit target by 2013. In addition to measures envisaged in the 2010 Budget and Stability
Program, which included increases in VAT rates and personal income tax, greatly restricted
hiring, cuts in selected transfers and

strengthened the envisaged
adjustment and enhanced credibility by taking concrete and emblematic measures, such as
cutting public sector wages (which should also have a signaling effect on the private sector).
The new deficit path is also appropriately front-loaded, with nearly two-thirds of the required
adjustment achieved by 2011.

But the envisaged adjustment is based on potentially optimistic macroeconomic
projections. On announced policies, staff projects the fiscal deficit to decline to 9.3 percent
of GDP in 2010, in line with the target, but only to 7 percent of GDP in 2011, 1 percent of
GDP above the target. The gap widens further over the medium-term to around 2½ -3 percent
of GDP in 2013. The differences arise from staff’s less buoyant macroeconomic projections
(especially on nominal GDP growth), which are also subject to significant downside risk.

23.
Staff projects the debt ratio to continue to rise to about 85 percent GDP by 2015.
Staff’s “baseline” scenario implies the debt ratio continuing to grow strongly (though still
below the projected euro area average) over the medium term. Even under staff’s “active”
scenario where the government’s deficit targets are met, the debt ratio still increases slightly
in 2013 and further consolidation in 2014 of about ½ percent of GDP would be required to
start reducing the ratio. The required adjustment would of course be even larger if yields
were to rise significantly.
24.
There are a number of additional risks to the planned medium-term fiscal
consolidation:


The tax base could recover more slowly than assumed. Household savings may
remain higher, and consumption weaker, given their high indebtedness and expected
increases in interest rates. Without reforms in the labor market, recovery in
employment may be more protracted affecting the labor tax base.



Achieving the necessary sustained spending
restraint will be challenging. The government
program envisages de facto freeze on primary
expenditure between 2009‒13. However, since
1996, primary spending has risen at an average
pace of about 7.2 percent a year.

without the regions doing their part. Beyond
2011, the lion’s share of consolidation is expected at the level of sub-national
governments, where the bulk of the spending occurs (see Annex).

16


Spain’s financing requirements are large and, retaining market confidence will be
critical. The central government’s gross financing needs for 2010 are some
€219 billion (21 percent of GDP); roughly half of this is needed for deficit financing
and the rest for amortization (with a peak in July). For 2011, the gross financing need
is about €226 billion (also roughly 21 percent of GDP).

The government should thus make the achievement
of their targets more credible and aggressively pre-empt any
slippage. Macroeconomic projections should be made more
prudent and additional measures prepared to ensure the targets
are attained. Such measures should protect the most vulnerable
segments of society and could include further reduction in
current spending (which has increased sharply over the last
decade) and investment (high by EU standards), reducing tax
benefits, and further raising still relatively low VAT and excise
rates. Such measures should be supported by structural reforms
to support growth.

Stronger fiscal frameworks could also support

objective analysis of fiscal developments
and long-term sustainability issues could
be useful to bolster the credibility of fiscal
policy.

17
Longer-term outlook
27.
Spain faces strong spending pressures due to aging and slowing population
growth. Costs associated with aging are projected to rise by 9 percent of GDP through 2060
(above the EU average), largely reflecting a relatively high increase in pension expenditure.
Combining a long-run projection of future fiscal primary deficits on current policies that
include these aging costs (in NPV terms) with other assets and liabilities already on the
Spanish public sector balance sheet results in a deeply negative public sector net worth of
some 200 percent of GDP in 2010, a large deterioration from minus 40 percent of GDP in
2007 (Table 7). Eliminating this gap would require an upfront permanent improvement in the
primary balance of close to 5 percentage points of GDP, in addition to the projected
turnaround in the primary balance by 2013. The European Commission also classifies Spain
as high risk regarding long-term sustainability, in light of its expected aging costs and the
large recent budgetary deterioration. In addition, the financial implications of supporting the
banking sector may be significant.
28.
Spain needs a bold pension reform. Major adjustments including raising the
retirement age, increasing incentives to work in old age, and adding an explicit link between
benefits/retirement age and changes in life expectancy would help bolster sustainability. The
government had proposed in its Stability Program presented in January 2010 a plan to reform
the pension system, whose key measure is to gradually increase the retirement age from 65 to
67 years. Other proposed changes under discussion include extending the period of earnings
history used to calculate pension benefits and limiting the use of early retirements. These
measures should be accompanied by a mechanism automatically linking key parameters of
the pension system, to life expectancy, in line with European peers that have already
reformed their pension systems. As such reforms would boost fiscal sustainability without
undermining growth, they should be quickly adopted.
Authorities’ views
29.
The authorities emphasized their commitment to achieving their deficit targets.
They saw staff’s macroeconomic scenario as overly pessimistic, especially given their
structural reform agenda, and the government’s good forecasting track record. They stressed
the measures adopted were sufficient to achieve the targets but that they stand ready to take
whatever additional actions are required, as the May 2010 fiscal package demonstrated. Were
additional measures to be required, the authorities thought there was sufficient scope on both
revenue and expenditure sides if needed. A pension reform had been initiated and the
necessary cross-party political support would require some months to coalesce.
30.
The authorities considered the existing fiscal frameworks to be sufficient to
achieve their objectives. The authorities were not convinced that an independent fiscal
council could play a useful role in Spain, and stressed the importance of accountability and
credibility of existing institutions and the role played by international organizations. They
agreed increased coordination with the sub-national governments is key to achieving

18
consolidation but stressed that existing arrangements, and the newly enhanced mechanism to
monitor and control their borrowing should be sufficient.
B. Real Sector: Fostering the Adjustment2
Competitiveness
31.
Indicators point to a significant, but declining, competitiveness gap. The growth
model of the boom years, driven by excessive domestic demand and a real estate boom, left
competitiveness damaged. While substantial adjustment has taken place in the last year or so,
in part automatically via the housing correction, the current account deficit remains above the
3 percent level that would stabilize Spain’s international investment position at its highly
negative 2008 level. The competitiveness gap, measured as the adjustment in the real
effective exchange rate needed to bring the current account to the level that would stabilize
the international investment position, is around 14 percent. Real effective exchange rate
measures through 2009 based on relative consumer prices and unit labor costs also indicate
an appreciation of about 20 percent since euro adoption in 1999 (Figure 13). About half the
real appreciation reflected relative price developments, with the rest driven by appreciation
of the nominal effective exchange rate (though this has reversed somewhat recently). While
export market share has been maintained, the export-to-GDP ratio is low for the size of the
economy and import penetration is relatively high. Labor and product market reform are
essential to restore competitiveness, in addition to boosting employment and growth.

Significant policy developments occurred after this Staff Report had been issued to the Board, which are
discussed in the attached Staff Statement and Staff Supplement.

Labor and product markets
32.
The labor market is not working. Employment and the unemployment rate are
highly cyclical, much more so than in other advanced economies3, causing large social and
productive costs (Attachment III and Figure 12). The underlying “structural” unemployment
rate is very high (about 14 percent), and the labor market is highly dual, with about a third of
the labor force in fixed-term contracts. The wage bargaining system, which hamstrings wage
and firms’ flexibility, is ill-suited to membership of a currency union. Unions represent
mostly permanent workers, who benefit from high employment protection, fostering wage
demands that do not fully internalize the employment implications, especially for the easily
dismissible temporary workers. Wage agreements are negotiated at the industry and province
levels and are automatically extended to the entire province or industry, without much scope
to opt-out for individual firms or workers. This problem is compounded by a high degree of
wage indexation, much more widespread than in other countries, causing a high wage drift
and reducing the sensitivity of real wages to labor market conditions.

A recent study suggests that the increase in Spain’s unemployment rate would have been halved had it adopted
France’s employment protection institutions before the recession.

20
33.
A radical overhaul of the labor market is urgent. The reform will need to be
ambitious and comprehensive if it is to significantly change labor market dynamics and to
avoid missing an historic opportunity. In particular:


reducing duality and encouraging permanent hires requires lowering severance
payments to at least EU average levels, having a more gradual increase in such
severance payments in the early years of tenure, and preventing excessive use of
unfair dismissals;



boosting wage flexibility and employment requires coupling this reduced protection
of permanent contracts with decentralizing wage setting (for example by moving to
an “opt-in” rather than “opt-out” system for collective bargaining) and eliminating
indexation.

34.
The prospective agreement by social partners may need to be significantly
strengthened. The government proposed some guidelines for labor market reform, focusing
on encouraging permanent hires, making working hours more flexible, improving labor
intermediation, and fostering youth employment, to be agreed by social partners. On the
critical issue of employment protection, the proposal being discussed is a generalization of
the 33 days (per year of service) severance pay for unfair dismissals (instead of 45 days) and
making the 20 day cost for fair dismissal more widespread. While these reforms are positive,
they fall short of the necessary “regime change” and, crucially, do not address the wage
bargaining system. Care should also be taken that any reform not increase the fiscal cost of
the system nor make temporary employment more difficult in the near term. The government
should thus follow up on its commitment to take action itself and introduce a more
fundamental reform, including of the wage bargaining system.
35.
Commendable progress on product and service market reform needs to continue.
Much progress has been achieved in recent years, especially in reducing the state’s
involvement in business operations and administrative burdens, and in reforming railways,
roads, and retail (Figure 14). The authorities have also transposed the EU Services Directive
into law (though implementation will be critical) and have submitted a Sustainable Economy
draft bill that will, among other reforms, partially eliminate incentives for buying houses and
promote the rental market. Given the pressing need to boost growth and competitiveness,
however, Spain should aim to be among the top performers in terms of product and service
market liberalization. The priority should be to further reduce restrictions on retail trade,
professional services, and the rental market. Reviewing the insolvency framework may also
be warranted.
Authorities’ views
36.
The authorities agreed with the need for growth-enhancing structural reforms.
The authorities recognized that Spain has a competitiveness gap, but did not think it was as
substantial as staff’s estimates, pointing to a range of factors, especially the robustness of
Spanish export market shares, the expected continued improvement in the current account

21
following the natural unwinding of the housing boom, and the recent improvement in
productivity and moderation in wages. On the labor market, the authorities agreed with much
of the diagnostic, but the government stressed the importance of including the social partners
in the reform although they were ready to act in the absence of agreement. The views of the
BdE, however, were closer to staff on the labor market and saw the need for a more rapid and
fundamental reform.
C. Financial Sector: Prompting Restructuring and Loss Recognition4
37.
The financial sector outlook remains difficult and vulnerabilities elevated. In
aggregate, Spanish banks report solid capital and provision buffers. However, risks remain
elevated and unevenly distributed across institutions. In an adverse scenario, in which
unemployment climbs to 24½ percent by 2011 and house prices fall another 15 percent,
NPLs are projected to peak at 7－8 percent in 2011. Taking into account repossessed assets,
securities investments and prudent loss-given-defaults, and assuming that pre-provision
income more than halves over the 2010–12 period, the gross drain on capital could reach
€5 billion and €17 billion respectively for commercial and savings banks (some 2 percent of
GDP and 5 and 22 percent of Tier 1 capital respectively and substantially less than the
€99 billion maximum potentially available under the FROB).5 The situation is further
complicated in that much of banks’ repossessed real assets is land, which is particularly
difficult to value.
38.
Despite the unprecedented measures announced by the European Union and the
ECB to stabilize markets, funding and profitability pressures loom. Although funding is
generally of medium-term maturity, market conditions remain difficult and access limited,
especially for smaller banks and for term funding. As of end-2009, the system has sufficient
liquid assets, including ECB eligible collateral, to broadly cover debt maturing at least during
2010. Further strains may arise from the unwinding of the exceptional liquidity measures by
the ECB, the ending of the funding guarantee scheme, and from the intense competition for
deposits. These funding difficulties, including declining private sector deposits, coupled with
lower earnings due to weak credit growth, higher provisioning for troubled assets and the
system’s overcapacity, will likely lead to pressure on profitability.
39.
Consolidation needs to accelerate to reduce overcapacity and produce more
robust institutions. Progress, under the aegis of the FROB, has been too slow, though the
recent agreement between the two main political parties in this regard and the announcement
of additional mergers is encouraging. Much more progress needs to happen before the FROB
deadline of end-June 2010, and thereafter the mergers/integrations need to deliver the
envisaged gains, such as cost reduction to strengthen profitability and capital buffers. The

discussed in the attached Staff Statement and Staff Supplement.

22
BdE should be prepared to intervene promptly if pockets of weakness remain. To this end
and to enhance investor confidence, a comprehensive and transparent bank-by-bank
“diagnostic” based on conservative assumptions on asset valuation and prospects could help.
In this context, a brief extension of the “capital support” window of the FROB might be
warranted.
40.
At the same time, the legal framework of savings banks should be updated for
the new economic context (see Annex and Box 2). Performance among savings banks is
highly diverse and the sector has an important role to play, but the current legal structure is
not well suited to Spain’s needs going forward. Under the current framework, cross-region
mergers still need to be approved by regional governments, the sector remains closed to
external investors, and savings banks’ capacity to raise external capital remains limited,
putting public funds at risk. The legislative and policy priority should be to: (1) reduce
political influence in savings banks; (2) enhance their ability to raise external capital, and
(3) offer an opportunity to transform into stock-holding companies, and, indeed, requiring
this for systemically important savings banks. This reform should be implemented promptly
to strengthen the consolidation process and to provide savings banks with the full range of
options to raise capital as soon as possible.
Authorities’ views
41.
The authorities broadly shared staff’s views. They considered that solvency and
funding weaknesses in the banking sector were limited to a handful of small/medium
institutions, mainly savings banks, and they are manageable and did not represent a threat to
credit flowing to the economy. They also agreed with staff that the consolidation and reform
of savings banks needs to be accelerated. While merits were seen in a UK/US style
diagnostic, the BdE pointed to the already high degree of transparency and strong rule-based
regulatory/supervisory framework. In addition, the part of the FROB law that allows direct
intervention to facilitate the restructuring of ailing credit institutions does not have a fixed
deadline. The BdE reaffirmed their readiness to swiftly address any remaining weaknesses in
the system to support market confidence. As for the reform of the savings banks, there is
political consensus to put forward a legal reform by the end of July.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
42.
The necessary adjustment is underway and output has stabilized. Imbalances
accumulated during the long boom have begun to unwind, with the current account deficit
halving as private savings surged and housing investment fell. Competitiveness has begun to
improve as productivity rose and the core inflation differential turned negative. The large
fiscal deficit is beginning to fall. Output rose slightly in the first quarter, ending the long and
deep recession. But unemployment has soared as firms adjusted employment rather than
wages or working hours.

23
43.
The recovery is likely to be weak and fragile. Growth is projected to rise gradually
to 1½‒2 percent in the medium term, with domestic demand weighed down by continued
Box 2. The Reform of Savings Banks: the Experience of Italy and Norway
Both Italy and Norway significantly reformed their savings banks in recent years. In Italy, the
reform was the first step towards their privatization whereas in Norway, the reform preserved
the savings banks' structure.
Italy—The process of reforming the banking sector started in the 1980s and reached its
turning point with the Amato law of 1990. This transformed the legal structure of savings
banks into joint-stock companies, the capital of which was conferred on (publicly owned)
foundations. The purpose was twofold: (i) to legally separate the banking business from
public-oriented activities (to strengthen the separation between management and ownership of
the credit institution); and (ii) to allow savings banks to issue common equity securities. In
principle, the foundation was supposed to behave as a disinterested investor, but in practice,
the foundation (and hence the political) influence over the banking activity remained
unchanged as the foundation (as major shareholder), retained the right to appoint the bank
management. Thus the subsequent legal interventions aimed directly at privatizing the banks.
The Dini law of 1994 repealed the obligation for the foundations to keep control of their credit
institutions and introduced tax advantages for those foundations willing to dispose of their
bank shares within a four-year period. The Ciampi law of 1998 set a mandatory four-year time
limit for the divestment by the foundation of their controlling interests in credit institutions;
lack of compliance would have triggered the intervention of the supervisory authority.
Norway— The process of deregulation, which started in mid-1980s, fostered consolidation of
the Norwegian banking industry, particularly in the savings bank sector. In 1987, the Savings
Banks Act was amended to enable savings banks to tap capital markets to strengthen their
equity capital by issuing primary capital certificates, termed equity certificates (EC) as from
July 1, 2009, which count as Tier 1 capital. The ECs are traded securities conferring property
rights over the capital and profits of the savings bank. The key principle is that the equity
certificate holders’ capital (equity capital) and the institution’s other capital (ownerless capital)
are subject to the same rules upon allocation to, respectively, dividends and charitable funds,
and upon allocation to reserves. EC’s representation in the general assembly is not
proportional to their share capital but it ranges between 20 and 40 percent, while the remaining
voting rights are allocated among the other stakeholders (depositors, employees, and municipal
council). An EC-bank is then a hybrid between a commercial bank and a nonprofit savings
bank. In 2002 savings banks were given the option of converting into limited companies. In
this case, the original capital must be converted into a foundation, which needs to own more
than 10 percent of the bank’s share capital to enable the converted entity to retain the
qualification of “savings bank.”

uncertainty, high unemployment, deleveraging and fiscal consolidation. Inflation will likely
remain subdued, helping regain competitiveness. The uncertainty around this outlook is large.
On the upside, household consumption could grow more rapidly as confidence firms, and the
global recovery and the weaker euro may induce faster export growth. On the downside, the
economy may stagnate as the weakness in private demand and fiscal consolidation interact,

24
and financial market conditions may also deteriorate further.
44.
Policy should focus on fostering the smooth rebalancing of the economy and
securing market confidence. This calls for quick and decisive action on: (1) fiscal
consolidation to put public finances on a sustainable footing; (2) making the labor market
more flexible to promote employment and its reallocation across sectors; and (3) banking
sector consolidation and reform to cement the soundness and efficiency of the system. The
heightened risks faced by Spain, and the heavy costs for Spain and others should they
materialize, makes these reforms especially urgent. Such a far-reaching strategy would be
helped by broad political and social support.
45.
Ambitious fiscal consolidation is underway, but achievement of the targets needs
to be made more credible and complemented by bold pension reform. To achieve the
implied 10 percent of GDP improvement in the primary balance from 2009 to 2013, the
government has taken a wide range of concrete and bold measures. The envisaged deficit
path, which implies cutting the deficit by more than five percentage points of GDP in 2010
and 2011, is also appropriately front-loaded. But to make attaining the targets more credible,
the macroeconomic projections should be made more prudent and additional measures
prepared. These should be supported by a bold pension reform, along the lines proposed by
the government in its Stability Program.
46.
Stronger fiscal frameworks could help. Robust mechanisms, in particular, aimed at
enhancing the incentives (both political and economic) for compliance, are required to ensure
regions deliver the needed adjustment. Institutionalizing spending review processes could
also help improve the quality and durability of spending reductions. An independent fiscal
council might also help bolster the credibility of fiscal policy.
47.
A radical overhaul of the dysfunctional labor market is urgent.6 The reform will
need to be ambitious and comprehensive if it is to significantly change labor market
dynamics and to avoid missing an historic opportunity. In particular:

6

Significant labor market policy developments occurred after this Staff Report had been issued to the Board. A
labor market reform (adopted in June 2010) has reduced severance pay for unfair dismissal, facilitated the
financing of a part of severance payments, eased the criteria for fair dismissal, and broadened the conditions for
firms to opt-out of collective wage agreements. The Staff Supplement attached to this report provides the staff’s
appraisal of these developments, reproduced here for convenience. “Although the reform has many positive
aspects that will improve the working of the labor market, there is scope for further strengthening. Notably,
severance pay remains above EU average levels and it is not clear whether the easing of criteria for fair
dismissal and procedures for opt-outs is sufficient to have a substantial impact – much depends on how the
courts interpret the new provisions. More generally, effective decentralization of wage setting to firms will
likely require a change in the collective bargaining process, which is currently under review by the social
partners. The government should thus take every opportunity to deliver the required radical overhaul, including
during the passage of the decree-law through parliament and the review of the wage bargaining system.”

25


reducing duality and encouraging permanent hires requires lowering severance
payments to at least EU average levels, having a more gradual increase in such
severance payments in the early years of tenure, and preventing excessive use of
unfair dismissals;



boosting wage flexibility and employment requires coupling this reduced protection
of permanent contracts with decentralizing wage setting and eliminating indexation.

Care should be taken that any reform does not increase the fiscal cost of the system or make
temporary employment more difficult in the near term. Ideally the social partners will
quickly deliver such an overhaul, but if not, the government will need to follow through on
its commitment to take action itself, including on collective bargaining.
48.
Commendable progress in recent years on product and service market reform
needs to continue. Many important measures have been taken recently, especially in
transposing the EU Services Directive (though implementation will be critical). The priority
going forward should be to further reduce restrictions on retail trade, professional services,
and the rental market.
49.
The banking sector remains sound but under pressure. Although impaired assets
have increased with the downturn, Spanish banks overall report robust capital and provision
buffers, supported by a strong supervisory framework. But the risks remain elevated and
unevenly distributed across institutions, focused mainly on the savings banks. On the
liquidity side, although funding is generally of good duration, market conditions remain
difficult. Further strains may arise from the unwinding of the exceptional liquidity measures
by the ECB, the ending of the funding guarantee scheme, and from the intense competition
for deposits. These funding difficulties, coupled with lower earnings due to weak credit
growth, provisioning for troubled assets and the system’s overcapacity, will likely lead to
pressure on profitability.

Significant financial sector policy developments occurred after this Staff Report had been issued to the Board.
The Staff Statement and Staff Supplement attached to this report provide the staff’s appraisal of these
developments, reproduced here for convenience. On the intention to publish bank-by-bank stress test results:
“Staff welcomes this intention, which should enhance transparency and underpin market confidence. It will be
important that the stress tests are based on sufficiently conservative assumptions and accompanied by a clear
strategy to recapitalize and restructure those institutions with capital shortfalls identified by the stress tests.”
On the accelerated savings bank consolidation process: “Staff welcomes this development, and it will be
important to ensure that the process reduces overcapacity and enhances cost efficiency as envisaged.” On the
reform of the legal and regulatory framework for savings banks: “Staff’s preliminary assessment of the reform is
positive, although further enhancement of some aspects would be beneficial. The assessment is preliminary as it
is based on the summary of the decree-law (as the full text had not been published by 12 July). In terms of the
objectives outlined by staff, the decree-law enhances the ability of savings banks to raise external capital, offers
an opportunity to transform into a stock-holding company, and reduces political influence. However, some

elements remain that could limit the attractiveness of savings banks to potential investors: the 50 percent limit
on the total amount of cuotas participativas a saving bank can issue is maintained, and, similarly, the capital
participation of saving banks in a SIP cannot fall below 50 percent, although the possibility envisaged in the
decree-law for savings banks to transform into foundations and transfer their banking activity to a bank would
effectively allow these limits to be exceeded. Also, systemically important savings banks are not required to
transform into joint-stock companies.”

ATTACHMENT I. SPAIN’S PRIVATE SECTOR BALANCE SHEETS1
A. Introduction
1.
The deleveraging of the non-financial private sector poses significant risks for
the economic outlook. Household and corporate indebtedness reached about 210 percent of
GDP, significantly higher than the euro area average of 160 percent and a two-fold increase
since the inception of the EMU. This dynamic was to a large extent driven by excessive
housing investment and the associated expansion in the construction and real-estate sectors.
An abrupt adjustment has taken place, with households dramatically adjusting their savings
and companies sharply reducing their net borrowing. However, the correction of these
imbalances to more sustainable levels has further to go and the necessary deleveraging
constitutes a source of vulnerability for the macro-economic outlook.
B. Households
2.
Spanish households have become heavily indebted, in particular to finance house
purchases. The pace of the increase in indebtedness was one of the fastest in the EU. From a
lower than average debt to gross disposable income ratio compared to the euro area at the
beginning of the decade (of close to 60 percent), Spanish households become some of the
most indebted (at over 125 percent in 2009). The growing financing need, even in the context
of fast income growth during the boom years, stemmed from the rapid expansion in
household residential investment, coupled with a relatively low savings rate. More than three
quarters of the increase in liabilities was used to finance mortgage purchases, the
overwhelming majority of which are floating rate. This has been linked to various factors,
among which tax incentives and the high propensity of Spanish households to invest in realestate, reflected by the high rate of owner-occupied residences (at 86 percent, the highest in
the euro area). Variable-rate loans represent over 90 percent of mortgages - compared to an
average of 44 percent in the euro area2 - which is indicative of the vulnerability of households
to monetary tightening and risk-premia shocks. Due to increased indebtedness and the
monetary policy cycle, the interest burden has more than doubled from the start of the decade,
to over 7.5 percent of gross disposable income in 2008, before falling back to around
6.2 percent in 2009.

3.
While a number of factors mitigate the vulnerabilities arising from high
indebtedness, risks are high and skewed towards the poorer households. About
75 percent of the debt of Spanish households consists of housing, the majority of which are
primary residences, implying lower default risks than for consumer credit. In addition,
residential mortgages in Spain have been predominantly of the traditional type, while riskier
products, such as home equity loans and buy-to-let mortgages have been negligible. The
share of mortgages with a loan-to-value ratio exceeding 80 percent has been limited - Spain
has largely avoided the problems stemming from “subprime” mortgages. While debt service
has increased over time (until declining recently), it has so far remained on average
manageable, with principal plus interest payments currently totaling about 18 percent of
gross disposable income. However, the distribution of household debt, income and wealth is
quite skewed. Households in the lower percentiles of the income distribution are significantly
more indebted than in other large economies with highly leveraged households3 (such as the
UK and the US). While the indebtedness ratio increased by 30 percent between 2002 and
2005 for the median indebted household, the figures are greater for low income and mediumhigh income group – at around 40 and 50 percent respectively. For the poorest indebted
households, debt payment increased from 30 percent of gross disposable income in 2002 to
38 percent in 2005 and for about a quarter of these households, debt to gross household
wealth exceeds 75 percent. However, relatively few low income households have debt
(19 percent in Spain, compared with 53 percent in the US4) and households have used
borrowing largely to purchase housing, implying a reduction in rent payments. Even taken
into account these factors, the financial burden ratio of low income households is high and
likely to have increased compared to the latest available survey from 2005. Taking also into
account the adverse macroeconomic developments, such as the high unemployment and the
tightening of financial conditions, imply that low income households may come under
considerable financial strain.
4.
While the asset side of the balance sheet is dominated by non-financial assets
(housing), net financial worth has been declining until recently. Even with the recent
decline in real-estate prices, at around 800 percent of disposable income, the housing wealth
of Spanish households is the highest among the large OECD countries. On the other hand,
financial assets expanded at a lower rate than liabilities prior to the crisis. Household
financial net worth declined from close to 200 percent of gross disposable income in 2000 to
about 110 percent at the end of 2009, which is lower than the euro area average of around
190 percent. The relatively low level of financial assets of Spanish households is also a

50
source of vulnerability, since it reduces the amount that can be used to pay off debt in the
event of adverse shocks. The financial asset allocations of Spanish households are broadly
similar to other European countries, dominated by deposits and equity (including mutual
funds) – each about 100 percent of gross disposable income - and investments in insurance
and technical reserves – at about 35 percent of gross disposable income (partly linked to the
fact that life insurance is required by credit institutions for house purchase loans). Large
valuation swings have affected both financial and the non-financial assets, partly as a
correction the overvaluations from the boom years.
5.
Significant adjustment in household balance sheets is taking place. Gross
disposable income, which grew faster than the euro area average until the crisis – at 7 percent
per annum compared to less than 4 percent – decelerated sharply after the second half of
2008, including a quarter of outright contraction in 2009:Q3 (and 1 percent increase for the
year). This dynamic has been driven by a sharp fall in the two main sources of income:
employee compensation and proprietors’ income, with automatic stabilizers - the increase in
net social transfers received and declining income taxes –only partly mitigating these effects.
The shock to current incomes, wealth losses on financial and non-financial assets, coupled
with the increased uncertainty, in particular regarding labor market prospects, have lead to a
dramatic increase in the savings rate. From 11 percent on average over the last decade
(compared to 14 percent for the euro area as a whole), the savings rate spiked to 18.8 percent
in 2009 – the largest increase in the EU. As a consequence, from a net borrower position of
3.8 percent of gross disposable income just before the crisis, households’ reverted to being
net lenders to the economy - to the extent of 10.3 percent of disposable income in 2009.
During the crisis, the composition of household financial assets has shifted towards less risky
and more liquid instruments, in particular deposits, as well as recent increases in mutual
funds and insurance technical reserves, while there has been a reduction in liabilities by
somewhat less than 1 percent in 2009. However, while the debt-to-income ratio has declined
to 125 percent in 2009, the debt-to-GDP ratio has continued to increase (to 86 percent at the
end of 2009), as overall economic activity displayed a stronger cyclical decline than
household income.
6.
Going forward, maintaining a high savings rate is critical to reducing household
debt ratios to more substainable levels. According to staff’s baseline projections, given
continued high uncertainty, which increases the precautionary behavior of households, the
savings rate is likely to remain elevated for the medium-term, gradually declining to a level
close to the euro area average (14-15 percent). As housing investment continues to contract
in 2010-11, households’ net lending capacity remains substantial, though gradually declining.
Households will use this additional financial capacity partly to build financial assets and
partly to reduce debt. In particular, the composition of household portfolios would shift
towards more liquid and safer investments (e.g. currency, deposits, government securities
and insurance technical reserves). New credit to households would remain negative in 2010
as lending conditions continue to be tighter than in the euro area and would revert to positive

51
territory afterwards, however at weak growth rates. Households’ net financial assets would
improve and debt ratios gradually decline, as growth recovers. However, this scenario is
subject to risks. On the upside, a faster recovery and increased confidence would lead to a
lower savings rate. Under the scenario in which households revert to their pre-crisis savings
rate of around 11 percent, the debt ratios would likely continue to increase (though this could
be compensated by households allocating more of their available resources to debt reduction).
Under a more adverse macroeconomic scenario, which may include financial market shocks,
financial asset price declines and a sharper adjustment of the property market, the savings
rate would remain even higher and deleveraging could be significantly more abrupt.
C. Non-financial Corporations
7.
Corporate leverage and indebtedness grew fast, especially in the construction
and real-estate sectors. The total corporate debt in 2009 at about 125 percent of GDP and
over 700 percent of gross operating surplus was among the highest in the euro area. While
indebtedness increased in all sectors, it was most excessive in the construction and real-estate
sectors, due to their inherent high credit intensity - for example, the debt to gross operating
profit was over 1800 percent in this sector in 2008. The pre-crisis increase in net borrowing
was mainly financed by loans and to a lesser extent by issuing new stock, while bond finance has
remained limited. Bank corporate credit amounted to about 90 percent of GDP in 2009 for the
entire economy, out of which approximately half was concentrated in construction and realestate (compared to the average for Germany, France, Italy and UK of 42 and respectively
15 percent5). The debt service burden of non-financial corporations also increased prior to the
crisis, to almost 30 percent of income in 2008, but has moderated significantly afterwards.
Construction and real estate face higher debt repayments than the rest of the economy – a
ratio of interest to gross operation profit of 69 percent in 2008, which is about double than for
the other sectors. Leverage ratios such as debt to equity and debt to assets percent have also
been among the highest in the euro area, both on aggregate and in most sectors. During the
current crisis, the total corporate debt to equity ratio peaked at over 100 percent in 2009 and
the debt to asset ratio at over 70 percent – 10 percent higher than in the euro area in both
cases. As debt increased much faster than financial assets, the (negative) net financial worth
of the corporate sector gradually deteriorated, to about 150 percent of GDP at the end of
2009, from about 100 percent at the start of the decade - also the current euro area average.
8.
High leverage was used to finance an investment boom. Spain’s average
investment rate over the last decade of 32 percent of gross value added exceeded by about
10 percentage points that of the euro area. At the peak in 2007, the Spanish investment rate
reached a level above 30 percent of GDP, roughly equally split between equipment and
construction. In particular, given the strong and growing contribution of residential
5

52
construction to Spain's economic activity during the last decade, housing investment
accounted at the maximum for 9½ percent of GDP. Abstracting from the dynamics of the
real-estate and construction sectors, the high investment rates were likely part of a normal
process of catching up with the more capital intensive core European economies. A result has
been the emergence of clusters of diversified and strong companies, in particular the exportoriented, technology intensive sectors (IT, aeronautics, energy, chemicals). The profitability
of large listed corporations, as measured by accounting ratios (such as the return on equity
and on assets) has been quite high by euro area standards.
9.
The corporate sector has started adjusting sharply. Following almost a decade of
high economic growth – aggregate net value added average growth rate of 7 percent,
3 percent higher than the euro - productive activity contracted severely in 2009, by close to
9 percent, compared to only around 4 percent in the euro area. As revenue fell, both
employee compensation (the main expense) and net entrepreneurial income (akin to pre-tax
profits in business accounting) declined significantly, while property income receivable
(which includes dividends and retained earnings from foreign investment) had some
mitigating effect. The collapse in the investment growth rate has also been much sharper than
in the rest of the euro area, mostly driven by residential investment which has halved to about
4 percent of GDP, while equipment investment has declined towards its historical average of
around 10 percent of GDP. While in the boom years, the net borrowing of the Spanish corporate
sector deteriorated sharply to over 30 percent of net value added right before the crisis
(11 percent of GDP), it has sharply adjusted during the recession to 6 percent of net value added
(2.2 percent of GDP). Credit to corporations contracted sharply. Loans to non-financial
corporations, which were rising at annual rates of up to 30 percent by 2007, declined abruptly,
causing a reduction in the debt stock in the second half of 2009 (by close to 3 percent). In
order to mitigate the scarcity of bank and market funding, companies drew down on their
relatively large stocks of liquid assets (cash and deposits) accumulated during the boom years.
10.
Corporate vulnerability has increased economy-wide, while being particularly
high in the construction and real estate sectors. Using a contingent claim approach (CCA)
analysis6, the risk of corporate defaults for all listed corporations has increased substantially
during the crisis economy-wide, but remains lower than in other Western European countries.
Based on theoretical BSM7 default probabilities, in a cross-country comparison, Spain ranked
slightly above the euro area in 2008. On the other hand, using Moody’s KMV, the default
risk of Spanish listed corporations are relatively low compared to their Western European

The BSM (Black-Sholes-Merton) expected default probabilities and distance to default measures are derived
under the risk-neutrality assumption and generally overstate the actual probability of default. Moody’s KMV
approach is based on mapping risk-neutral expected default frequencies (EDFs) into “actual” EDFs – i.e. based
on historical default and bankruptcy frequencies of Spanish corporations.

peers. Financial distress has been most acute in the construction and real-estate sectors. The
average one year-ahead BSM default risk in the construction sector has exceeded 50 percent
in 2008, surpassing the over 30 percent implied default probability in the financial, insurance
and real-estate sector. Moody’s KMV data also show above average expected default
probabilities for the construction, real-estate development, tourism and consumer nondurables sectors. Actual corporate defaults have also increased: the number of insolvencies in
the real estate sector in 2009 was about 9.5 times that registered in 2005, compared with
4.3 times in the non-real estate-related corporate sector8.
11.
Going forward, corporate deleveraging to more sustainable levels will require
difficult trade-offs. Under staff’s baseline scenario for the medium-term, in an environment
with sluggish growth, weak corporate income and mounting financial debt expenses, the
corporate sector as a whole would face significant trade-offs between expanding activity and
rebalancing its financial structure. Deleveraging will continue, in particular in the
construction and real-estate sectors, which will substantially shrink their balance sheets, as
their contribution to economic growth going forward is going to be modest. The corporate
debt to GDP ratio and other measures of leverage would gradually decline, as the sharp
improvement in corporate net borrowing continues and growth starts to gain traction.
However, this scenario is subject to risks. On the positive side, higher demand may boost
activity faster, as there is substantial spare capacity, the construction and real-estate sectors
have significantly deleveraged and a weak euro is boosting international competitiveness. On
the downside, risk-premia shocks may increase the interest burden and may constrain the
supply of credit. Under this scenario, firms will be forced to deleverage faster, restructure
their debts and shed assets, while investment would remain very weak in the medium term.

Background
2.
Over the last 30 years Spain has become one of the most decentralized
industrialized countries.2 Subnational government spending increased significantly over the
period 1979-2005, accounting for about a half of total public spending in 2008 and nearly
80 percent of public consumption. The number of employees has also increased from
6 percent of public sector employment in 1983 to 54 percent in 2009. In particular,
employment at the ACs surged following the full devolution of health expenditure in 2002.
The ACs are primarily responsible for education and healthcare, while local governments are
responsible for other services including water and sewerage, waste management, parks, and
street lighting.

The current structure of general government includes the central government (incl. social security), 17
Autonomous Communities (ACs, regional governments) at the intermediate level, and the local levels of
government (50 provinces and 8,112 municipalities, including 2 Autonomous Cities). While the ACs have some
regulatory powers over the local governments, the fiscal structure is not hierarchical—the central government
deals directly with the intermediate and local level of governments.

57
3.
Significant decentralization has been accompanied by fiscal consolidation,
though the subnational governments have consistently underperformed. Until 2008
Spain enjoyed favorable surprises in macroeconomic assumptions. During 1999-2007, real
GDP growth exceeded the budget forecast by about ½ percentage point on average. Despite
the favorable surprises, the general government fiscal outturn was only slightly better than
budgeted, by 0.1 percent of GDP on average. The key contributing factor was the
underperformance by the subnational governments, especially the ACs whose fiscal outturn
was on average 0.3 percent of GDP weaker than budgeted. In part this reflected a widening
gap between their spending responsibilities, especially on healthcare, and revenue raising
powers. With the global financial crisis, the extent of the subnational underperformance
widened to about 2 percent of GDP in 2009.

Financing system of the subnational governments
4.
The rapid decentralization and the associated increase in spending pressures by
the ACs led to a gradual reform in the financing system. The reform aimed at higher
revenue autonomy by the ACs to secure greater efficiency and accountability. The initial
funding system was predominantly on the basis of a general purposes grant, which was
gradually changed to a system funded by ACs ceded taxes, revenue sharing in central
government taxes, and a general equalization transfer. A new financing system approved in
December 2009 under the common regime3 shifted further resources to the regions. The new
financing system increased the share of ceded and shared taxes in total revenue to roughly
90 percent allowing annual adjustment to reflect any significant demographic changes.
Moreover, it transferred more regulatory powers to the ACs to expand their capacity to
decide on the composition and volume of their revenues.4 Recent changes have brought the
3

Two different financing systems coexist: the Basque Country and Navarre have almost full fiscal autonomy,
while the other ACs have more limited fiscal autonomy under the “common” regime.

Fiscal Rule
5.
In the context of EU membership, to ensure meeting the Maastricht criteria a
stronger level of coordination in fiscal policy became necessary among all levels of
governments. The Budget Stability Law was approved in 2001, which has provided the
means to distribute the general government deficit target between different levels of
Fund to Guarantee Public Services or Guarantee Fund (GF) which will be shared among ACs according to
adjusted population. Each ACs will retain the remaining 25 percent of the tax revenue. The GF ensures that ACs
meet their funding needs with the resources assigned under the new model. ACs will also receive funds from
the two Regional Convergence Funds. The Competitive Fund aims at reinforcing fairness and efficiency in
funding needs and the Cooperation Fund seeks to harmonize regional development by fostering the convergence
of per capita income between regions. The new funding system will be fully in place in 2011.

59
government. The law was amended in 2006 to
deal with procyclical nature of the rule and
was revised to target a fiscal balance over the
cycle for the general government, excluding
the social security system. To avoid the
complexities of defining the cyclical position,
the law establishes targets depending on the
real growth rate: a fiscal balance for normal
growth between 2 and 3 percent, a small
deficit for low growth; and a surplus (of
underdetermined size) for high growth. For
the social security system, it envisages a
separate target, set to ensure its financial
sustainability. Targets for each region are
determined by bilateral negotiations; in the event of incompliance, a 3-year financial
recovery plan needs to be submitted and approved by the Fiscal and Financial Policy Council
(CPFF)5. In case of non-compliance, authorization from the central government is required to
obtain credit operations abroad or issue public debt. To further strengthen the control of the
regions, additional conditions were introduced to obtain debt authorization and increase
transparency by providing the information in a more timely manner.
Challenges ahead
6.
The current system of fiscal federalism will likely face some challenges in
delivering the needed fiscal consolidation.


Mismatch between revenue and spending growth outlook: the new financing scheme
has increased the subnational share of the tax revenue, but the revenue outlook is
particularly uncertain, reflecting a significant erosion in the tax base (housing market)
and higher unemployment. In contrast, ACs expenditure is basically structural (health
and education), which has rapidly increased in recent years and pressure may
continue to arise from aging, especially on healthcare.



Optimistic projections: In staff’s view, the macroeconomic projections underpinning
the government’s medium-term fiscal consolidation plans may prove optimistic,
especially in outer years when the subnational governments are expected to play a
larger role in the consolidation. The recovery in the two main taxes, PIT and VAT,
may only pick up slowly, reflecting permanent erosion in the tax base. Transfers and
grants from the State, linked to the state’s revenue, are also projected to fall.

5

The CPFF is a consultative body that links the central and regional governments, composed by the Ministries
of the central government and representatives of the ACs.

60


Need for coordination: The general government budget objectives are set by the
central government, while the objectives for the subnational governments need to be
coordinated in the CPFF of the Autonomous Communities and the National
Commission of Local Administrations. Setting the individual objectives for each
subsector in turn involves negotiation among the sectors, though the central
government has half of the votes of the CPFF.

7.
Countries have adopted different approaches to ensure fiscal discipline at
subnational levels (Table 1). Common rule-based approaches focus on budget balances, debt
ceilings or capacity to service debt, and expenditure ceilings. Alternatively, many countries
use sanctions to foster compliance of subnational governments with rules. These include
financial sanctions or administrative constraints which involve authorization of the
subnational governments’ borrowing operations by the central government. However, studies
suggest effective implementation of these rules requires key conditions including a robust
legal basis, a clear definition of institutional responsibilities, timely and transparent reporting,
and credible enforcement of rules and sanctions.
Recommendations
8.
A range of measures could be considered to strengthen the compliance with, and
credibility, of the subnational fiscal consolidation plans. While longer-term issues of the
fiscal federalism framework should be revisited (such as the growth rates underpinning the
fiscal rule), the most pressing need is to strengthen the likelihood that subnational
consolidation plans will be adhered to and are credible. A range of options might help,
mainly focused on increasing the costs (both political and economic of non-compliance).


Introduce credible penalties/enforcement mechanisms for non-compliance:
without any penalty for not fulfilling the 3-year financial recovery plan, regions can
continue to present new plans every year, postponing adjustment. This has been
exacerbated by the lack of timely information on the ACs’ budget execution which
hindered implementing the necessary recovery plan. The recent decision to tighten the
criteria for debt authorization should help but there may be additional channels for
borrowing through the ownership and control of local enterprises and banks that are
difficult to monitor. Withholding transfers could be an alternative option in case of
non-compliance.



Link non-compliance with regional tax rates. The ACs have not much used their
greater regional tax autonomy. In particular, the ACs have only marginally used their
discretionary powers for the personal income tax which accounts for the bulk of their
own tax revenues. To enhance regional accountability, non-compliance with targets
could trigger an automatic increase in regional tax rates.

61

6



Introduce binding multi-year spending ceilings: At present specific constrains exist
such as on personnel—the central government imposes a limit on the increases in the
number of permanent employees, and sets basic salaries and their annual adjustments
for civil servants. But this has been partly circumvented by hiring on temporary
contracts.



Adopt more cautious macroeconomic projections. More prudent macroeconomic
projections minimize the risk of excessive transfer to the regions and thus for a
“refund” (the difference between the projected and realized taxes) at the settlement
after two years.6 This would also give more incentive for regions to use their revenueraising powers to cover their required resources or improve efficiency. An
independent fiscal council to set the projections might be helpful in this regard.



Change the timing of transfers and settlement – there seems to be a case for
changing the revenue sharing to be directly linked to actual revenue, rather than
linking to budget projections for adjustment in two years. Alternatively, in line with
the recent decision to allow repayment to the central government (negative transfer
due to weaker revenue outturn than budgeted) to be distributed in 60 months, any
positive transfers should be also conducted in installments, which could also prevent
fiscal policy being procyclical.



Broadening the coverage of the existing rule - the Golden rule could be extended to
include larger municipalities.

The excess of taxes allocated to ACs in 2008 amounts to about €6 billion. Instead of fully paying back in 2010,
the ACs will repay in 60 monthly payments from January 2011.

ATTACHMENT III. THE SPANISH LABOR MARKET IN A CROSS-COUNTRY PERSPECTIVE12
This annex places the Spanish labor market in a cross-country perspective and examines the
factors behind the Spanish labor market problems. Specifically, it attempts to shed light on
two related questions: (1) What labor market institutions and policies explain the high
underlying unemployment rate and share of temporary workers? (2) What reforms could cut
both the unemployment rate and the share of temporary workers?
A. A Highly Dysfunctional Labor
1.

Problems include:



A high structural unemployment rate. Spain has had the highest unemployment
rate among the EU15 for most of the period since 1980. Even during the recent
boom years, its unemployment rate remained relatively high and with the recent
crisis it has returned to 20 percent, double the EU15 average and the highest in the
EU15. It affects especially young and temporary workers.



High cyclicality of employment and unemployment. Output elasticities of
employment are larger than for other EU15 countries. When faced with a strong
negative demand shock, firms adjust by dismissing workers or going out of business
rather than reducing wages or working time. In contrast, when output picks up,
employment rebounds substantially.



High share of temporary contracts, but few part-time contracts.3 About
30 percent of the labor force is in temporary contracts, the highest level in the EU15
(since the mid-1980s) and about double the EU15 average. The incidence of
temporary contracts is highest for youth and women. In contrast, the share of parttime contracts (another type of flexible contract) has remained very low in Spain.



High degree of wage rigidity. Wages and labor costs have been growing faster than
in most other EU15 countries, but also much faster than labor productivity growth,
leading to widening unit labor cost differentials. Moreover, real wages have not
responded much to the conditions of the labor market and have even behaved
counter-cyclically, amplifying employment fluctuations.

Temporary contracts (or workers) refer to both fixed term contracts (workers) and temporary agency work
contracts (workers).

64
B. The Roots of the Problems
2.
The literature has identified a number of institutions and policies as important
determinants of labor market outcomes.4 Among these, Spain stands out in its system of
collective bargaining and the employment protection of permanent workers.


Spain is among the few countries with an intermediate level of coordination of wage
bargaining. The coordination of wage bargaining takes place primarily at the
province and industry level, instead of the national or company level. This system is
less employment-friendly than either a highly coordinated system where externalities
of excessive wage agreements can be better internalized or a completely
decentralized system where wage agreements can be better tailored to the individual
company. The wage bargaining system is made worse by: (i) national guidelines for
wage increases are further increased at the industry/provincial level, and sometimes
at the company level; (ii) unions represent mostly permanent workers (union density
is very low), yet wage agreements are automatically extended to the entire province
or industry, creating a large insider-outsider problem; (iii) "opt-out" clauses (clauses
that allow firms to opt-out from the agreements if economic conditions become
difficult) can only be used under very restrictive conditions that give some control to
competitors.



Wage agreements also stand out by their high degree of indexation to inflation.
Wages are typically highly indexed on past inflation and corrected when inflation
turns out higher than expected (but not vice versa), increasing real wage rigidity.



Dismissing permanent workers is very costly in Spain.5 While Spain scores well on
the length of notice periods and on procedures, it has among the highest severance
payments and a very restrictive interpretation of fair dismissals. Due to the latter,
about 90 percent of lay-offs of permanent workers are treated as unfair. Severance
payments in case of unfair dismissals vary between 33 and 45 days per year of
service with a maximum of 24 and 42 months respectively. For a worker with
20 years of tenure, this implies a severance payment of 22 months of salary,
compared with an average 14 months in the EU15.6 Severance payments for fair

4

These include the level and duration of unemployment benefits, the tax wedge, employment protection
legislation, union density, the degree of centralization/coordination of collective bargaining, active labor
market policies, and the extent of product market regulation.

5

Spain scores average on the OECD overall indicator of employment protection for permanent workers. The
OECD indicator suggests that the strictness of regulation on temporary contracts is above EU15, but this seems
at odds with the high share of temporary workers in Spain.

6

The difference is even greater if one compares with the conditions for fair dismissals in EU15, since many
unfair dismissals in Spain would actually be considered fair in other countries.

65
dismissals are also much higher in Spain than the EU15 average, for all tenures. In
contrast, severance payments for temporary workers are only 8 days per year of
service. Finally, the trial period, i.e., the initial employment period during which an
employer can dismiss a new employee without severance payment, is much shorter
than in other countries. The effect of employment protection on the unemployment
rate is unclear a priori: it reduces hirings but also firings. However, it has been
argued that it increases the share of temporary workers, as employers use temporary
contracts to avoid the inflexibility created by the high protection of permanent
workers.


Spending on active labor market policies remains low and relatively focused on
employment subsidies instead of training and public employment services. Although
active policies do contribute to reduce the unemployment rate, there is much
controversy about the size of their impact.

3.
Spain’s differences with EU15 are less marked on other policies. Unemployment
benefit net replacement rates are broadly in line with the EU15 average at 50 percent
(average over first five years), but with a steeper profile which seems broadly adequate to
strengthen incentives to return to the labor market, while providing high initial protection.
The tax wedge is also broadly in line with the EU15 average at 32 percent, although the
composition varies somewhat, with higher employers’ social security contributions and
lower employees’ social security contributions and personal income tax (and cash benefits).
Product market regulation is somewhat below the EU15 average.
C. Determinants of the Unemployment Rate
4.
A quantitative analysis finds that unemployment increases with intermediate
bargaining, high unemployment benefits, a high tax wedge, and strict product market
regulation, but is little affected by employment protection legislation.7 The estimated
model tracks closely the behavior of the unemployment rate in Spain from 1982 to 2007 (the
last year for which all data are available), and these findings are broadly in line with those of
the literature.
5.
The model suggests that the Spanish equilibrium unemployment rate has not
changed much from its high level over the last 25 years. The equilibrium unemployment
7

The estimated equation relates the unemployment rate to the degree of coordination of wage bargaining (and
its square, to allow for non-linearity), union density, the degree of employment protection legislation, the
average gross replacement rate of unemployment benefits, the tax wedge, the degree of product market
regulation, the lagged unemployment rate (to allow for autocorrelation), the output gap, and country and time
fixed effects. The model is estimated on a sample of 20 OECD countries during the period 1982-2007. See
forthcoming working paper for details.

66
rate, i.e. the unemployment rate implied by the
evolution of policies and institutions once all
adjustment has taken place, is around 14 percent and
has only slightly declined by 1.5 percentage point
since 1982. Over this period, there was little change
in the system of wage bargaining and the tax wedge.
And while the deregulation of product markets
boosted employment creation, this was largely offset
by a sharp increase in unemployment benefits.

5

7 percent. With the tax wedge, unemployment
benefits, and product market regulation broadly at the EU15 average, the bulk of the
difference in equilibrium unemployment rates between Spain and the EU15 seems to reflect
the higher degree of coordination of wage bargaining in other EU15 countries. However, the
magnitude of this effect should be taken with caution, due to the small number of
observations that are available to estimate the impact of such a policy change.

7.
Reforms to reduce the unemployment rate should focus on moving towards
more flexibility of wage bargaining and/or a combination of reducing unemployment
benefits and the tax wedge. Policy simulations using the estimated model suggest that
moving from an intermediate level of bargaining to either a fully coordinated bargaining

67
system or a completely decentralized bargaining structure would reduce the equilibrium
unemployment rate by a substantial amount (estimated between 7 to 10 percentage points,
though the magnitude should be taken with caution). Given the relatively large size of the
Spanish economy (implying a diversified productive structure) and the current need for
sectoral reallocation from nontradables to tradables, moving towards flexibilization rather
than centralization of wage bargaining would seem preferable. Reductions in the
unemployment benefit replacement rate and the tax wedge would also help reduce the
unemployment rate. Although it would take large changes in each of these two policies to
reduce substantially the unemployment rate, a combination of moderate changes in both
could deliver a substantial reduction in the unemployment rate while minimizing the
budgetary impact (see Table). Finally, the literature suggests that spending on active labor
market policies would gain in efficiency by refocusing on training away from employment
subsidies.

For the coordination of wage bargaining, the alternative policy scenario considered is a complete centralization.

8.
The experience of other countries suggests that the equilibrium unemployment
rate can be reduced substantially by a mix of policy and institutional reform. Four
EU15 countries have succeeded in reducing substantially their actual and equilibrium
unemployment rate and bringing it to one of the lowest pre-crisis levels (Annett, 2007).
These are Ireland, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Denmark. Ireland took some
sweeping steps: it sharply reduced the tax wedge and union density, and transformed
collective bargaining from decentralization to complete coordination. The other three
countries used a mix of more moderate policy changes, including decreases in
unemployment benefits, tax wedges (UK and Denmark) and union density, and product
market deregulation.

demand, making it easier for employers to impose
flexible contracts which fit their needs. Finally,
lower product market regulation could increase the share of temporary workers for several
reasons: (i) lower product market regulation increases competition and the need for firms to
be able to adjust quickly, making it more tempting to hire temporary workers; (ii) lower
product market regulation tends to favor the expansion of services sector, where temporary
work is more frequent; (iii) the lower rents induced by lower product market regulation may
prompt firms to reduce labor costs by hiring temporary workers (with lower wages and
dismissal costs).
10.
Reforms to reduce the share of temporary workers should focus on reducing
the employment protection of permanent contracts and/or a combination of reductions
in the tax wedge and unemployment benefits. The estimations suggest that the reforms
enacted by Spain since the 1990s to reduce the employment protection of permanent
8

The estimated equation is similar to the one for the unemployment rate. The main difference is that it allows
different subcomponents of the employment protection legislation index to have different impacts on the share
of temporary workers. Indeed, while high employment protection of permanent workers would tend to increase
the share of temporary workers, strict regulation of temporary work should reduce it. The model is estimated
on a sample of 20 OECD countries during the period 1985-2007 (or maximum years available). See
forthcoming working paper for details.

9

We are aware of only one macroeconomic study that looks at the determinants of the share of temporary
workers (Nunziata and Staffolani, 2007). They also find a negative impact of EPL for permanent workers on
the share of temporary workers using a panel of European countries over the period 1983-1999.

69
workers contributed to reduce the equilibrium share of temporary workers; however this was
to a large extent offset by product market deregulation. Policy simulations using the
estimated model imply that bringing the three components of employment protection of
permanent workers to the minimum level observed in the EU15 would reduce the share of
temporary workers by respectively 1, 3.5, and 9 percentage points, or a total of
13.5 percentage points (see Table). Reducing the tax wedge and the replacement rate of
unemployment benefits would also help to lower substantially the share of temporary
workers.

11.
The unemployment rate and the share of temporary workers are positively
correlated, suggesting the two could be reduced simultaneously. Countries with higher
shares of temporary workers also have higher unemployment rates. The results from the
regressions confirm these conclusions: most reforms of labor market institutions and
policies either yield changes in the unemployment rate and the share of temporary workers
that go in the same direction (e.g. unemployment benefits and the tax wedge) or affect one
without affecting the other (e.g. EPL and the degree of coordination of collective
bargaining). The main exception is product market reform that seems to reduce the
unemployment rate but increase the share of temporary workers, suggesting that product
market reform should be accompanied by labor market reform (especially lowering of the
protection of permanent workers).

12.
Interestingly, a higher share of part-time contracts is associated with a lower
unemployment rate. This is in sharp contrast to the share of temporary workers, which is
positively correlated with the unemployment rate. While both types of contracts provide
additional flexibility, most part-time contracts are voluntary, hence they do not reflect
adverse labor demand, but rather seem to be “imposed” from the supply side. They
encourage the participation and employment in the labor market of groups that would
otherwise not work, e.g. women especially with children, youth, and older workers. This
may be an avenue worth pursuing for Spain, which has a very low share of part-time
contracts.
E. Conclusions
13.
Reforming labor market institutions and policies can have substantial effects on
the unemployment rate and the share of temporary workers. Different policy mixes can
achieve a similar result. A fundamental reform of the collective bargaining system towards
flexibilization of wage bargaining would go a long way toward bringing the unemployment
rate closer to the EU15 average. But a combination of more moderate policy changes,
involving reduced unemployment benefits, lower tax wedges, and further product market
deregulation would also deliver a significant improvement in the unemployment rate.
Turning to the objective of reducing the share of temporary workers, one key reform needed
is the reduction of employment protection on permanent workers, though reducing
unemployment benefits and the tax wedge would also help. Interestingly, some reforms –
especially those of unemployment benefits and tax wedges – seem to improve
simultaneously the unemployment rate and the share of temporary workers. In contrast,
product market deregulation reduces the unemployment rate but at the cost of an increase in
temporary employment. Hence, it suggests that product market reform should be

71
accompanied by labor market reform, especially by a lowering of the employment
protection of permanent workers.
14.
One aspect not examined in this paper is the role of interactions between
policies and/or institutions. One interaction that would seem particularly important in the
Spanish context is between decentralization of collective bargaining and the reduction of
employment protection on permanent workers. If the employment protection on permanent
workers is not reduced substantially, the decentralization of collective bargaining may not
lead to the expected flexibility in wages, as unions’ representatives would keep defending
the interest of their firm’s permanent workers at the cost of the firm’s temporary workers.
Hence, it appears that these two reforms would have to be implemented hand-in-hand to be
effective.

72
ATTACHMENT IV. REFORMING THE SPANISH SAVINGS BANKS1 2
A. Overview
1.
One of the main features of the Spanish banking sector is the major role played
by savings banks. The Spanish savings banks (cajas) are financial institutions organized as
private foundations with no formal owner and pursuing a wide array of competing goals:
from promoting savings, to enhancing competition and to contributing to regional
development. Given the lack of ownership, the law identifies five groups of stakeholders—
depositors, local and regional governments, founders, employees, and other (private or
public) institutions—to whom it provides representation in the institution’s governing
bodies, although relative voting powers vary depending on the specific regional law. The
savings banks do not have any share capital and their equity consists mainly of reserves
generated through retained earnings.
2.
Savings banks have gradually reduced their regional specificity, expanded their
range of activities, and become solid competitors to commercial banks. With the
deregulation of Spanish financial markets in mid-1970s, savings banks were allowed to
carry out universal banking activities; compulsory direct lending coefficients were gradually
lifted and abolished in 1992; branch barriers were removed in steps until they were
completely eliminated in 1988. Nowadays, savings banks offer a wide range of financial
products and activities like regular commercial banks: from bank-assurance to asset
management and private banking. Over time many savings banks strengthened their national
presence, as illustrated by the increasing trend in the number of employees and branches,
which resulted in some overcapacity in the system (Figure 1). This expansion went hand in
hand with growing lending to construction companies, real estate developers, and to
households for mortgages. Although deposits have continued to fund a large share of the
activities, savings banks have increasingly relied upon wholesale credit markets.
3.
The universe of savings banks remains, nonetheless, heterogeneous. The sector
comprises two large players (La Caixa and Caja Madrid), which compete nation-wide and
on international markets; a few medium-sized institutions (Bancaja, Caja del Mediterráneo,
Caixa Catalunya), which have a market share, measured in terms of credit institutions’ total
assets, of at least 2 percent; and 40 small and very small institutions (Figure 2).
4.
The allocation of responsibilities in the regulation and supervision of cajas is
grounded on a delicate balance between central and local powers. In broad terms, Banco

Significant policy developments occurred after this Staff Report had been issued to the Board, which are
discussed in the attached Staff Statement and Staff Supplement.

73
de España (BdE), as banking supervisor, has powers over financial stability aspects, related
to the solvency and liquidity of such institutions, while the competence of autonomous
communities (ACs) falls more within corporate governance and consumer protection issues.
Cross-regional mergers among savings banks need to be approved by the respective ACs.
The central government maintains responsibilities in the issuance of sanctions such as
revocations of licenses, performed in cooperation with BdE.
B. The Impact of the Global Financial Crisis
5.
Despite the traditional retail-oriented business model and forward-looking
prudential regulation, the Spanish banking sector came under pressure with the
unfolding of the crisis. At the start of the crisis, the authorities implemented policies aimed
at shoring up market confidence and banks’ liquidity conditions (Table 1). As the
deteriorating operating environment and the collapse of the property market increased
pressure on domestic banks’ capital, the emphasis shifted to consolidation and
recapitalization.
6.
Savings banks, albeit with different intensity, suffered the most and the outlook
is challenging. A number of factors, which in part apply to commercial banks as well,
contribute:


Reported NPLs may underestimate the actual quality deterioration of the loan portfolio.
Like commercial banks, savings banks have actively managed their exposure to the
ailing real estate and construction sectors through debt-for-property swaps. Staff
estimates that repossessed or acquired real estate assets by savings banks amount to
around €31 billion, equivalent to 38 percent of Tier 1 capital. If these problematic assets
were included in measuring the quality of loan portfolios, the NPL ratio for savings
banks would increase from 5.3 to 8.6 percent and the coverage ratio would drop from 56
to 34 percent.



Asset valuation might be overstated. The picture is complicated by the fact that about
45 percent of repossessed assets is land, the true value of which is particularly uncertain.
However, the BdE has introduced changes in order to promote adjustment in the housing
sector: the provisioning applied to real estate assets held into financial institutions’
balance sheets has been increased from 10 to 20 percent if these assets are held longer
than one year; a proposal to rise the provision to 30 percent after two years (unless an
updated appraisal proved it not to be necessary) has been issued for public consultation
on May 26, 2010.



Profitability is under pressure. Despite a temporary improvement in net interest income
due to the different re-pricing of assets and liabilities, savings banks have witnessed a
marked contraction of their profitability owing to provisioning. Going forward, pressure
on the cost of funding together with lower credit volume and still high loan loss
provisioning would weigh on savings banks’ capital generation capacity.

74


Savings banks have relied heavily on official liquidity support and government
guarantees. Savings banks hold the lion share of bonds issued with the Spanish
government guarantee; almost three-quarters of the total for an amount of € 32.5 billion
(see below). As for refinancing operations with the ECB, the use by savings banks is
estimated to range between 40 and 70 percent of total refinancing operation carried out
by the Spanish credit institutions.

7.
While the authorities’ policy measures have contributed to mitigate the impact
of the liquidity squeeze, the process of bank restructuring and consolidation has fallen
short of expectations, though has accelerated recently.


Caja Castilla La Mancha (CCM) was intervened by BdE in March 2009 and taken over
by Cajastur in November 2009 through a competitive tender procedure in line with the
statutory requirements of the Deposit Guarantee Scheme for Saving Banks. Nonetheless,
the operation raised market criticisms regarding the cost and transparency of the
transaction, which preserved a role for the stakeholders of CCM in the new institution.



In June 2009, the BdE approved the merger between Unicaja and the ailing Cajasur but
after almost a year of negotiations Cajasur rejected the merger and the BdE decided to
intervene it (May 2010).



Only recently a handful of institutions requested financial support from the FROB,
subject to EU Commission approval (Table 2).



Another group of cajas (Navarra, Burgos, and Canarias) has launched the first Sistema
Institucional de Protección (Institutional Protection Scheme—SIP) by creating the
banking group Banca Cívica.3 Another four mergers and three SIPs have recently been
announced.

8.
The launch of the FROB has not prompted significant changes in the legal
framework of the savings bank sector, except in the case of direct intervention (Box 1).


3

Cross-border mergers still need to be approved by local authorities. The few attempts
have been frustrated by political difficulties.

SIPs were originated in the cooperative sector. SIPs could be defined as a contractual agreement aimed at
protecting and improving the liquidity and solvency of participating institutions, which remain separate legal
entities. SIPs are regulated by the BdE, which recently strengthened the conditions for establishing such an
arrangement, including: (i) the constitution of a central entity (either a savings or a commercial bank) which is
responsible for determining business plan and activities , risk management and internal control for the group as
a whole as well as the fulfillment of the regulatory consolidated reporting requirements; and (ii) a binding
contract of mutual support among the participating institutions equivalent to at least 40 percent of each
institution’s equity.

75


Due to their legal nature, savings banks remains closed to external investors. Preventing
private sector involvement increases the risk for tax-payer money. Furthermore, savings
banks’ capacity to raise external capital remains limited.
C. Elements of a Far-reaching Reform

9.
The current situation calls for a more fundamental restructuring of the savings
bank sector. While the crisis presents challenges for the banking system, it also offers an
opportunity to restructure it to become more resilient to future crises. The reform process
should be guided by three fundamental objectives:


Strengthening the oversight and intervention powers of BdE;



Enhancing the ability of savings banks to raise external equity; and



Opening savings banks to more dynamic structures of ownership and governance.

Strengthening the BdE’s oversight and intervention powers
10.
Although savings banks are subject to the same prudential regulation as
commercial banks, the opaqueness of their ownership and the relevant political
involvement complicate the playing field.


Market mechanisms to ensure prudent management do not fully apply. Although the
majority of savings banks are rated by international agencies, given their legal status and
the lack of traded equity capital, potential takeovers do not represent a possible threat
and hence a disciplinary device.



The fact that mergers and acquisitions between savings banks need to be approved by
ACs adds a political dimension, which further complicates the picture. Negotiations
have proved to be lengthy because ACs need to agree on the distribution of the public
sector representatives in the governing bodies of the new institutions. The difficulties in
this political bargaining do not seem to lessen even in cases where one of the merging
institutions has significant solvency issues. This can prevent mergers when they might
be economically advantageous.



The dual legal framework governing savings banks poses the risk of potential conflicts
in the exercise of supervisory and sanctioning authority. Although the cooperation
between the BdE and ACs has worked smoothly, and there are circumstances where –
due to legal ambiguity – overlapping national and regional legal frameworks may cause
conflicts, particularly in the application of supervisory authority on prudential issues.4

4

The BdE has full powers on prudential issues. Each AC operates under its own legal framework, which
generally provides for licensing, supervisory and sanctioning authority to oversee the activities of saving banks

(continued)

76


In case of weak institutions, typical corrective actions that affect shareholders—such as
call for cash (equity) injection, or suspension of particular or all shareholders rights—
cannot be applied since the control exercised by savings banks’ stakeholders is not
coupled by legal ownership of the institution and the capacity of savings banks to raise
equity capital is limited.



Although the BdE has the powers to intervene ailing savings banks, this does not
necessarily imply that the stakeholders of the intervened institution lose control,
although the decisions of the board of directors have to be validated by the special
administrator appointed by the BdE.

11.
The attribution of responsibilities between the BdE and ACs needs to be
reformed to strengthen the BdE’s oversight powers over savings banks. The trend
towards a consolidation of the savings banks sector may increase their systemic relevance.
Against this background, it is of paramount importance to avoid any potential fragmentation
of regulatory and supervisory powers thus bringing the supervisory framework for savings
banks closer to that established for commercial banks. In particular, the legal regime should
empower the BdE with the sole responsibility of approving mergers of savings banks, while
taking into account the national competition authority’s opinion.
Enhancing the savings banks’ ability to raise external capital
12.
The savings banks’ limitations in raising equity capital have several
implications: (i) they may reduce the scope of these institutions to expand if a particular
operation (e.g., a purchase of another institution) requires more capital than what the caja
has; (ii) they seriously limit the capacity to replenish capital if an institution suffers major
losses; and (iii) they deprive savings banks of an instrument (the value of a share) to assess
the market’s view on an institution’s performance on a continuous basis.
13.
Although savings banks can issue capital instruments, market appetite is
limited or their loss-absorption capacity is doubtful. Besides issuing subordinated debt
(Tier 2 capital), the capital instruments available to savings banks are:


the cuotas participativas (Tier 1 capital) – equity-like variable income instrument that
grants no voting rights to its holder; there are limits on individual investor’s holding
(5 percent) and on the total amount that an institution can issue (50 percent of capital).
In seven years since the legislation was passed, Caja de Ahorro del Mediterraneo has
been the only savings bank to have issued cuotas participativas.5

headquartered in their respective jurisdictions, particularly with regards to corporate governance, consumer
protection, transparency and dividend policies supporting social contributions (obra social).
5

The issued cuotas participativas represent 7.5 percent of the equity of Caja del Mediterraneo.

77


the participaciones preferentes (Tier 1 capital in the case of qualifying preferred
participations and Tier 2 capital in the case of non-qualifying preferred participations) –
a subordinated debt instrument that grants the holder the right to receive a fixed dividend
when the issuer (a caja) obtains profits, and no right to dividends when the institution
suffers losses. Two recent events, however, raise doubts about the real loss-absorption
capacity on a going-concern basis of participaciones preferentes: the securities issued
by CCM were bought back at par after the institution was intervened; and Cajasur paid
the March 2010 €1.5 million coupon on its €150 million outstanding hybrid capital.

14.
Savings banks have to adapt to the forthcoming new more demanding capital
requirements. The forthcoming new Basel agreement is likely to raise the quality,
consistency, transparency, as well as the minimum level of bank capital. Savings banks may
find the new regulatory environment more challenging than commercial banks owing to
their limited ability to raise external equity capital.
15.
Against this background, savings banks’ loss-absorbing capital instruments
should be improved. The first option would be to remove the quantitative limits to cuotas
participativas and grant representation and voting rights to investors; this would be almost
equivalent to issue equity shares. In this case, however, the question arises as to how such
form of capital, and its remuneration, fits with the overall design of cajas as not profitdistributing organization. Another possibility would be to allow the issuance of contingent
capital notes (like Radobank in the Netherlands), which will probably require the definition
of the proper legal framework.
Strengthening ownership structure and governance
16.
The influence of local governments over savings banks has become a macrofinancial risk. In principle, public ownership does not entail, per se, less prudent
management than private ownership if appropriate arms-length arrangements that safeguard
bank management’s commercial autonomy from political powers are established. However,
as recent events have shown, political difficulties have delayed the consolidation process
and even the appointment of top managers at certain systemically important savings banks.
17.
Strengthening the separation between management and savings banks’
stakeholders would be crucial. To this end, reducing the number of political
representatives in the governing bodies of savings banks can be a first step. However, it
should be taken into account that there are many ways in which political interference can be
exercised over business decision making processes, and representation in governing bodies
is but one.
18.
To break the above mentioned link and to achieve a sound management of
savings banks the first line of defense is to have effective legislation setting out proper
and fit criteria. The legislation needs to ensure, also at a local level, that the management

78
has the appropriate authority and autonomy to perform its functions, and that a dividing line
is drawn between the business, day-to-day decisions and the political control. Further, the
exercise of a strong, independent, supervisory function will be necessary to ensure
compliance with such fit and proper standards. Empirical evidence suggests that not always
have chairs of savings banks had sufficient experience in managing and operating a credit
institutions and this contributes to explain the heterogeneity in savings banks’ performance.6
19.
Spain’s economic and financial development has much reduced the rationale
for the legal distinction between savings and commercial banks. Paraphrasing the
famous “duck” test, one could argue that since savings banks behave like commercial banks,
offer the same financial services like commercial banks, can be systemically important like
commercial banks, then they should probably be commercial banks in all aspects including
the legal structure. From a political economy point of view, savings banks, at least the
largest ones, no longer address specific market failures, such as limited access to financial
services of some social groups.
20.
Such a change in the legal structure has a number of advantages. It would
clarify the ownership structure of these institutions. It would help these institutions to tap
capital markets to raise equity capital. It would open the consolidation process to “outside”
investors (Spanish or foreign institutions) and, hence, it would reduce the threat to the public
finances. In this new environment, the take-over threat and the potential additional layer of
external shareholders would be a strong disciplinary device on managers’ behavior.
21.
The change in the legal structure can be either voluntary or mandatory. Norway
chose the first approach; Italy opted for the second one across the board. A possible third
approach could be to make the change in the legal structure mandatory if a savings bank’s
market share exceeds a determined threshold. Empirical evidence, in fact, indicates that
when savings banks increase in size, the economic goals (profit maximization) gains in
importance over the social-oriented ones.7
22.
The resources of the FROB could be used to incentivize this structural change.
The resources of the FROB could be dedicated to those savings banks (individual or
potential merger) that decide to opt for the stock-holding company option but need
additional capital to clean their balance sheet from doubtful real estate exposure. As in the
current framework, the FROB would become a shareholder of these “transformed”
institutions with the opportunity to sell its participations directly to the market.

Box 1. The Fondo de Reestrcturación Ordenada Bancaria (FROB)
The objective of the FROB is to assist and foster the reorganization of the Spanish banking industry
(Royal Decree Law 9/900). The initial capital of the FROB amounts to €9 billion, of which €2.25 billion
were contributed by the Deposit Guarantee Funds (Fondos de Garantía de Dépositos, FGDs) and the rest
by the state (unused resources from the FAAF). The FROB can issue securities guaranteed by the state
and/or it can seek other funding, but it can leverage up to 10 times (i.e. €99 billion).1/ The law envisages
two courses of actions: the integration and the restructuring process. The capital-support window for the
former process will expire on June 30, 2010.
The integration process is for fundamentally sound institutions that need a temporary capital injection to
support their merger or takeover plans, which have to be approved by the BdE. The beneficiaries are
deemed to be fundamentally sound when according to BdE do not present weaknesses that can affect their
viability and have a core capital (capital, reserves, generic provision) ratio of at least 6 percent.
The capital injection by the FROB, which takes the form of convertible preference shares, cannot exceed
2 percent of risk-weighted assets, except in exceptional circumstances.2/ In any event, the subscription of
securities by the FROB is capped as a maximum to the amount necessary to reach a core capital ratio of 8
percent taking into account the potential economic losses in a two-year horizon.
The FROB securities are part of the non-core Tier 1 of the beneficiary institution and will carry an annual
yield equal to the minimum between 7.75 percent and the 5-year Treasury bonds plus 500 bp. The rate is
increased by 15 bp each year. However, the interest is not cumulative and it is paid whenever and to the
extent that the beneficiary institution has distributable profits. The issuer is commitment to repurchase the
preference shares within 5 years.3/ If the time period expires and the issuer has not repurchased the
preference shares, or if the BdE at any time consider the buy-back to be unlikely, the FROB will convert
the securities into ordinary shares (or its equivalent for the other credit institutions) and the restructuring
process will apply (see below).
The FROB support is subject to behavioral safeguards; in particular (i) refrain from non-organic growth
(or downsize in case of FROB subscription exceeds the envisaged threshold or the institution is not
fundamentally sound); (ii) align managers’ remuneration to the Commission recommendations; 4/ (iii)
enhance cost efficiency; and (iv) cap (or refrain from) dividend distribution. Should these safeguards be
breached, the rate of FROB securities will be increased by 200 bp.
The restructuring process is aimed at those institutions affected by significant weaknesses (i.e., asset
quality, capital adequacy and capacity to generate recurrent revenues), which could jeopardize their
viability in the medium to long term. Should a market-oriented solution fail, the BdE would directly
intervene the weak institution and appoint a FROB representative as its administrator (as it happened in
the case of Cajasur). The FROB will devise a restructuring plan, to be approved by the Bank of Spain,
which would outline the steps necessary to overcome the distressed situation. This could result in a
merger with other institutions with a high degree of solvency, or the sale or transfer of its assets and
liabilities through an auction process, among others. Support during the restructuring period could come
in the form of guarantees, loans at favorable rates, subordinated debt, the acquisition of assets or capital
injections.
To allow the operability of the FROB in the case of savings banks, the Law governing those institutions
has been amended to remove current limits on individual holding of cuotas participativas (5 percent) and
total amount of cuotas that can be issued (50 percent of capital), and to grant voting power to the cuotas
issued in favor of the FROB. Furthermore,
Furthermore, specific transactions to merge credit institutions (including savings bans) under the
restructuring process approved by the BdE will not require any additional administrative authorization
other than those required by the competition law.
—————————————
1/

On November 19, 2009, the FROB issued its first bond for €3 billion with a five year bullet maturity and a 3 percent
coupon paid annually. The issue was rated triple-A given the irrevocable and unconditional guarantee by the state.
2/
In these circumstances, the prudential limit of 30 percent of Tier 1 to the total issuance of convertible preference
shares is waived.
3/
Exceptionally, the buy-back period can be extended for two more years at a penalty surcharge of 100 bp per year.

ATTACHMENT V. EXTERNAL AND FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY
Spain has large domestic and external funding needs for the next few years. The
government’s funding pressure arises largely from amortization payments. On a year-todate basis, the central government has raised roughly 37 percent of its total funding needs
for 2010, in line with its pattern from 2009. Relative to its European peers on a debt-toGDP basis, the public sector is not exceptionally indebted. And, debt rollover is a small
portion of total government debt – the average maturity has lengthened in recent years to
6.8 years. Still, market scrutiny of its ability to meet its financing needs has increased
recently and interest costs on newly-issued debt have risen. Spain’s external funding needs
arise largely from bank debt.
Baseline Scenarios
In the baseline scenario for the fiscal sustainability assessment, the underlying fiscal
position is projected to improve slightly over the medium-term, with the gross financing
need-to-GDP ratio peaking in 2011, at 22 percent, before falling gradually thereafter. Still,
though improving, relative to history, gross government financing need is expected to
remain large.
By contrast, and despite the narrowing current account deficit, the underlying gross external
financing need is expected to extend its recent trend and rise gradually, reflecting primarily
banks’ reliance on wholesale funding.
Alternative Scenarios for Fiscal Sustainability


Interest rate. Real interest rates in the baseline scenario are assumed to average
3.1 percent over the projection period. The impact of an increase in interest rate is
not expected to have a significant effect on interest expenditure. Should real interest
rates increase above the historical average of 1.3 percent (the historical average is
depressed in large part by relatively high GDP deflators in the mid 2000s) and reach
3.7 percent (representing a ½ standard deviation shock), debt would increase to
97 percent of GDP by 2014/15, a little over 2 percentage points of GDP above the
baseline. The modest impact on interest payment reflects the long average life of
central government debt, whose average maturity has risen from 5.5 years in 2000 to
6.8 years in 2009. As a result, debt rollover over the forecasting period is expected
to modest.



Growth. Relative to interest rates, Spain’s public debt profile is more sensitive to
shocks to growth. Should growth fall by a little over 1 percentage point over the
forecasting period, the debt-to-GDP ratio could reach 108 percent by 2014/15,
13 percentage points higher relative to the baseline.

83


Euro depreciation and contingent liabilities. In the case of a 30 percent nominal
depreciation of the euro, after adjusting for domestic inflation, and a contingent
liability shock of 10 percent of GDP, the debt-to-GDP trajectory is expected to
increase to 105 percent. It is notable that the portion of the government’s liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies is small, at less than 2 percent. Thus, all else
being equal, the impact of a sudden depreciation in the euro exchange rate on the
debt profile would be modest.

Alternative Scenarios for External Sustainability
Despite the large external financing need, growth and current account shocks are expected
to have modest impacts on the debt profile, while the impact of higher interest rate is
projected to be small. And, largely as a result of the modest amount of debt denominated in
foreign currency – at roughly 5 percent, a sharp depreciation of the currency poses limited
risk to the baseline scenario.


Interest Rate. The impact of a permanent ½ standard-deviation shock to the interest
rate for all outstanding debt — a 0.6 percentage point increase from the baseline —
would increase debt by roughly 4 percentage points to 116 percent of GDP in 2015.



Exchange rate. A one-time 30 percent depreciation in the euro in 2010 would
increase debt by about 5 percentage points to 112 percent of GDP.



Combined shock. A permanent ¼ standard deviation shock applied to the real
interest rate, growth and the current account balance would increase external debt to
121 percent of GDP by 2015 (9 percentage points more than the baseline).

2010 Article IV Consultation: A staff team comprising J. Daniel (Head), K. Honjo,
F. Jaumotte, M. Moreno-Badia, A. Popescu (all EUR), S. Chen (SPR), and A.
Giustiniani (MCM) visited Madrid on May 13–May 24, 2010 to conduct the 2010
Article IV Consultation discussions. Mr. Guzman, Ms. Balsa, and Mr. De Las Casas
from the Spanish Executive Director’s office, joined the discussions. For outreach,
the mission met with parliamentarians, trade unions, employers’ organizations,
bankers, and independent analysts. The concluding statement was published and the
staff report is expected to be published as well. The Consultation includes annexes on
(1) Spain’s Private Sector Balance Sheets; (2) Fiscal Consolidation and Fiscal
Federalism in Spain; (3) The Spanish Labor Market in a Cross-Country Perspective;
and (4) Reforming the Spanish Savings Banks. Spain is on a standard 12-month
cycle. The last Article IV consultation discussions were concluded on March 11,
2009.

VI.

Exchange Rate Arrangements and Restrictions: Spain’s currency is the euro,
which floats freely and independently against other currencies. Spain has accepted the
obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, and maintains an exchange rate
system free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international
transactions, other than restrictions notified to the Fund under Decision No. 144
(52/51).

Statement by Mr. Ramon Guzmán, Executive Director for Spain
July 14, 2010
We thank the staff for the work put into the Report. While we broadly share the staff’s
analysis, most of the policy recommendations have somehow been overtaken by the response
of my authorities to the crisis, with bold and ambitious measures that had been under
preparation for months and were adopted within weeks of the consultations. These measures
aim at returning to a sound fiscal position and at unlocking potential growth through structural
measures in both the factor and product markets. Financial sector restructuring and the labor
market reform are crucial steps already adopted, but also products and services markets have
been under thorough reform. We would call the attention of the Board towards the Update
Supplement and to Section 2 below.
1. Background
For more than a decade, Spain experienced a period of strong growth during which the
economy developed substantial imbalances; namely, the overall level of debt of households
and corporate sectors (linked to a large extent to the real estate boom) and persistent large
current account deficits. Euro adoption in 1999 eliminated the currency risk and brought
unprecedented low levels of real interest rates. European savings joined domestic savings to
finance a buoyant private demand, also fueled by higher disposable income, intense job
creation and consumer and business confidence.
It is relevant to underline that the increase in the indebtedness of the Spanish economy was
essentially a private sector phenomenon. Spain adhered strictly to the European (SGP) public
deficit and debt limits. By 2007 public debt was 36.1% GDP (well below EU average) and
Spain presented a 2.2% GDP surplus.
Banks tapped European savings to finance credit growth through the securities markets.
However, a sound regulatory framework kept risks at bay; provisions—including a
countercyclical generic buffer—were roughly four times higher than in other EU banking
systems; off-balance sheet vehicles were banned out of the banking landscape and lending
standards did not universally relax (NPL in mortgages are still today below 3 percent).
The correction of the imbalances started in 2006–07, albeit in a gradual manner, induced by
the combination of rising interest rates and stronger European demand. When the central
scenario was that of a soft landing, the international financial crisis triggered a credit squeeze
and delivered a shock to private sector confidence that accelerated the correction and caused a
severe economic downturn. The economy adjusted mainly in quantities. Construction sector
activity plummeted. The inefficiency of the Spanish labor market produced unemployment at
the same speed as it produced employment during the boom. The downturn hit especially
those under fixed-term contracts and those involved in the construction industry. Consumption
and investment also adjusted severely. However, inflation also turned negative for a brief
period, for the first time in decades.

2
Banks resisted the first impact of the crisis without government support (with the exception of
some liquidity and funding facilities put in place during the first stages of the turmoil)
although uncertainty about the length and depth of the downturn compelled the Government to
initiate the restructuring of the sector. Some weaknesses gradually appeared, mainly linked to
the Cajas. The Spanish savings banks suffered from a relatively high exposure to Real Estate
and, given its legal nature, a more limited access to capital markets.
The sound initial fiscal position also helped the economy weather the initial phase of the
crisis. However, the fall in tax receipts and the increase in transfers via unemployment
benefits took the deficit to unexpectedly high levels (11.2 percent of GDP at end 2009). Part
of the deficit originated in the stimulus measures adopted to mitigate the impact of the crisis
as part of the EU/G20 coordinated response.
The management of the Greek crisis failed to prevent contagion to other European countries.
In January 2010, Spain announced fiscal measures redoubling efforts to consolidate, already
within the restrictive envelope of the 2010 Budget. Also, in January, the Government
launched the pension reform debate and challenged unions and business federations to reach
agreement on a reform of the labor market in six months. Tensions in financial markets
continued to increase. Ultimately, in the weeks immediately after the European Council
Decisions of May 9th (creation of the EFSF in the wake of the approval of the Greek package)
my authorities multiplied their efforts to stabilize market perceptions and to support the
incipient recovery.
2. Recent Policy Measures
Fiscal measures. The first priority was to reassure markets on the commitment of the
Government to fiscal sustainability. On May 20th Parliament approved a package of fiscal
measures to guarantee the accomplishment of the 3 percent deficit target by 2013. The
measures reverse the stimulus package put in place during 2009 and deliver further structural
adjustment, altogether adding 1.5 cumulative percentage points in 2010 and 2011, to the initial
consolidation plan. The measures are bold; they imply significant cuts in wages (applicable to
all levels of Government), pensions, public investment and other current expenditures. The
deficit is projected to fall from 11.2 percent to 9.3 percent of GDP by end 2010, and to 6
percent of GDP by end 2011. The package effectively frontloads 60 percent of the total
adjustment in the first two years of the consolidation period (2010-2013).
On June 15th the Fiscal and Financial Policy Council—that coordinates fiscal matters with the
regions—unanimously agreed on the fiscal targets for the regional governments for the period
2010-2013. Moreover, the agreement with the Regions contemplates a significant tightening
of the budgetary discipline framework, with bi-annual evaluations linked to the adoption of
additional measures and/or to debt authorizations. An explicit prohibition to municipalities to
raise debt in 2011 has also been introduced. Finally, on June 16th the Government approved
the expenditure ceilings for 2011 (with a 7 percent reduction on preceding budget ceilings).
The fiscal policy is designed around its deficit targets and is independent of the macro
scenario. Monitoring will detect slippages due to lower growth and additional measures are

3
prepared and will be implemented if the 6 percent or the 3 percent targets were at risk. Any
excess receipts will not be used to increase expenditure.
Last but not least, a comprehensive pension reform is underway in the context of a special
parliamentary Commission. The Government has tabled a proposal based on a gradual
increase of the retirement age (to 67 years), on strengthening the relationship between
contributions and benefits, and possibly including an adjustment of other parameters of the
current system. This reform will be finalized in the next few months and will constitute a
decisive step to guarantee the sustainability of the pension system and a significant
improvement of the long-term fiscal outlook.
Labor market reform. The second challenge was to reform the labor market in order to
unlock growth potential. Again, the staff report and update describe the main issues. Let me
emphasize that the two key objectives are a) to foster the flexibility of firms, both in terms of
wages (effectively allowing for the opt out clauses to function) and working conditions and, b)
to reduce the duality in the labor market by generalizing the use of an indefinite contract with
33 days wages per year of service as termination payment (currently 45) and by providing
legal certainty and a less burdensome process for the firing of workers on economic grounds.
The measures approved represent a significant break with years of inaction and point in the
right direction as staff highlights. As with any structural change, its effects will be felt only
over a period of time, but my authorities are confident that the newly awarded flexibility will
serve the companies well in adjusting to competition, ultimately facilitating the shift of
resources towards the tradable sector from less productive activities.
Financial sector. Finally, the consolidation process of the financial sector under the FROB
(Fund for the Orderly Restructuring of the Banking sector, launched in June 2009) was
finalized. The FROB avoided a widespread recapitalization and addressed the problems of
banks individually and minimizing costs for the taxpayer. The process has ended with 92
percent of the Cajas sector assets (39 out of 45 Cajas) involved in merger operations. This
process will imply a 15 percent reduction in personnel and a 25 percent reduction in terms of
branches, significantly reducing capacity and triggering synergies that will help get credit
flowing back into the economy.
As the consolidation process went on, lingering doubts about the health of the sector centered
on bank´s exposure to Commercial Real Estate (CRE). In April 2010, GFSR and BoS stress
tests took into account this exposure and concluded that, even in the most severe scenarios,
losses would be contained and FROB resources would comfortably cover them. My
authorities have since promoted the publication of stress tests, on a bank by bank basis, in
order to restore the credibility of the robustness of our financial system. Pending details on
common assumptions and methodologies, the BoS has already committed to this publication
in the context of the European wide stress tests, probably on July 23rd.
Looking beyond the short term, the Government approved the Reform of the regulatory
regime of Cajas, on July 9th. Basically, this reform aims at facilitating the transformation of
Cajas into banks (by delinking the banking business from the consolidated and merged Cajas)
with total independence from the former governing bodies, professional management and

4
subject to capital markets discipline. A number of small, vocationally local, Cajas might be
allowed to retain their legal statute, but the regulatory burden will be tailored to carefully
balance their capitalization capabilities and business models.
3. Outlook
While we agree on the thrust of Report, our analysis is more optimistic on the pace of the
recovery. Differences of view merely qualify the challenges facing the economy and impact
on the speed and specific shape of the adjustment looking forward, but do not imply
differences on the broad diagnosis, neither on the policy mix necessary to facilitate recovery:
Real Estate Sector downsizing. The necessary price correction in housing might be
overestimated. Demand for housing services or for housing as a store of value has proven a
consistently sound investment; NPLs in mortgages are below 3 percent which hints at nonspeculative factors behind demand (population dynamics, size reduction of households).
However, supply outgrew demand in 2006 and 2007 and the stock of unsold houses, estimated
at 700,000, will start to shrink in 2010, but still limits residential investment that will remain
negative in 2010 and 2011. The length and speed of this adjustment is crucial for the
economy; my authorities estimate that within two years trend demand will absorb the
accumulated inventory.
Speed of deleveraging. A close up picture of the Spanish private sector’s indebtedness
reveals important facts concealed beneath the averages. In the corporate sector, leverage is
essentially a problem linked to the Real Estate boom. Credit to Gross Value Added for the
Construction and Real Estate sector reached 439 percent in 2009, while it is a mere 62 percent
for the rest of the non-financial corporations, not far away from the 53 percent average in the
Euro Area. All in all, gross savings rates and net borrowing to GDP rates of non- financial
corporations prove that the deleveraging process of Spanish firms is well underway.
Also household deleveraging might prove faster than what staff anticipates. Households
financed their housing investment with bank debt and in doing so increased their real wealth
and reduced their housing expenses. If residential rent payments are taken into account, debt
service relative to income is moderate, while interest rates remain at historically low levels (96
percent of mortgages at variable rates). Moreover, as the staff points out, households’ savings
ratio has jumped to unprecedented levels making deleveraging compatible with moderate
consumption growth [especially non-durables and services].
Competitiveness of the Spanish economy. Over half of the investment that took place in the
run-up to the crisis did not go into construction, or into real estate. ‘’Asian’’ rates of
investment helped modernize the capital stock and the infrastructures of the economy. Price
competitiveness indicators tend to overestimate cost and inflation factors as the engines
behind our current account deficit, and conceal the well-known dual inflation problem in the
Spanish economy (export prices do not rise as those of non tradable). If it is probably true that
the ongoing reduction of costs vis-à-vis the rest of the world would contribute to the
rebalancing of our growth model, it is easy to exaggerate the degree to which it is necessary in

5
the overall adjustment of the economy. My authorities do not foresee a drastic deflationary
process looking forward.
To sum up, my authorities have embarked in an ambitious package of measures to put in place
the necessary conditions to facilitate the rebalancing of our growth and to trigger the recovery.
However, progress will not be possible unless financial market conditions stabilize. While the
measures adopted, per se, should have a positive impact on consumer and investor confidence,
and increase aggregate demand, we are also fully aware of the importance of the recovery
within the EMU and the EU more broadly, and of the importance of fiscal consolidation and
banking sector recovery at the European level.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation with
Spain
On July 14, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Spain.1
Background
After 15 years of strong growth led by a housing boom, the Spanish economy has
entered a sharp downturn in the wake of the global financial crisis since mid-2007.
Output fell sharply, driven by sharp declines in investment, exports, and private
consumption, while weaker imports and rising government demand provided some
offset. Imbalances accumulated during the long boom have begun to unwind, with the
current account deficit halving as private savings surged and housing investment fell.
Competitiveness has begun to improve as productivity rose and the core inflation
differential with the euro area turned negative. However, the crisis has taken a heavy
toll on the labor market, with the unemployment soaring to 20 percent, reflecting wage
and working hour rigidities, the large share of temporary workers and the real estate
bust. A labor market reform was adopted in June 2010.
The general government deficit swung from a surplus of 2 percent of GDP in 2007 to a
deficit of 11.2 percent of GDP in 2009, due to the large stimulus and evaporating
cyclical and one-off revenues. The debt ratio increased significantly – though from a
low level. Fiscal consolidation is underway, including with a range of measures taken in

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions
with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and
financial information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and
policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for
discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing
Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this
summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in
summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2010, aimed at achieving the government’s deficit target of 3 percent of GDP by 2013
(which has also been agreed with sub-national governments).
Spanish banks overall report robust capital and provision buffers, supported by a strong
supervisory framework. However, risks remain substantial and unevenly distributed
across institutions. The authorities have put in place a range of measures to support
banks, including the Fund for Orderly Bank Restructuring (Fondo de Reestructuración
Ordenada Bancaria—FROB) that supports the consolidation and recapitalization of the
sector by providing temporary capital assistance to merging credit institutions. The
process of consolidating savings banks has accelerated – as of end-June 2010, 12
merger/integrations were underway, comprising 92 percent of the assets of the savings
bank sector. Governor Ordóñez also announced in mid-June the Bank of Spain’s
intention to publish bank-by-bank results of stress tests. A decree reforming the
regulatory framework of savings banks was approved by the government on July 9,
2010.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that the necessary adjustment of the economy is underway
as imbalances accumulated during the long boom years have begun to unwind, and
that output has stabilized. The growth outlook, however, remains uncertain owing to
unstable financial market conditions and weak domestic demand.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ decisive policy response to the financial market
turbulence and recent reform measures to secure market confidence and foster the
smooth rebalancing of the economy. They noted that the Spanish authorities have
undertaken significant corrective measures since the staff report was issued. They
stressed that continued action will be needed on several policy fronts, including: (i)
moving ahead with fiscal consolidation and pension reform, to put public finances on a
sustainable footing; (ii) strengthening the recent labor market reform, to promote
employment and its reallocation across sectors; and (iii) and following through on
banking sector reform, to cement the soundness and efficiency of the system. Directors
emphasized that these actions will help to contain the heightened risks faced by Spain,
and to avoid the heavy costs for Spain and other countries should these risks
materialize. Directors agreed that the successful implementation of such a far-reaching
reform strategy will require broad political and social support.
Directors endorsed the ambitious fiscal consolidation underway. They welcomed the
wide range of concrete and bold measures adopted and considered the envisaged
deficit path to be appropriately front-loaded. Directors stressed that, owing to the
considerable uncertainty associated with the macroeconomic projections, additional
measures should be prepared if needed to make attaining the targets more credible.
Directors underscored the need for a bold pension reform to complement fiscal
consolidation and recommended strengthening compliance mechanisms.
Directors welcomed the recent labor market reform and encouraged further efforts to
make the labor market more flexible and competitive. They broadly agreed that
severance payments should be reduced to at least EU average levels and that this

3
should be complemented by further clarifying the conditions for fair dismissals,
decentralizing the wage setting process, and eliminating wage indexation.
Directors noted that the banking sector remains sound, but faces elevated and
unevenly distributed risks. They welcomed recent consolidation of savings banks and
the reform of their regulatory regime. They also welcomed the authorities’
announcement of their intention to publish bank-by-bank stress tests results, noting that
it will be important for these tests to be based on realistic assumptions and
accompanied by a clear strategy for addressing capital shortfalls faced by any
institutions.
Directors commended the considerable progress achieved in recent years on product
and service market reform. They agreed that, going forward, the main priorities should
be to further reduce restrictions on retail trade, professional services, and the rental
market.
