EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
•

Although Tajikistan’s transition to a market economy has been protracted, the
authorities’ stabilization and reform efforts are bearing fruit. Real GDP growth
averaged 10 percent a year in 2001–04, and inflation has declined steadily to
5½ percent by end-2004. The implementation of structural reforms has been slower,
however, especially in the agricultural and public sectors.

•

Performance under the PRGF-supported program has been satisfactory. All the
quantitative performance criteria for end-September 2004 and the indicative targets
for end-December 2004 were observed, the main exception being arrears to utility
companies, which are being addressed. The structural performance criteria were
observed, and the structural benchmarks have been implemented, although in some
cases with delays.

•

The program for 2005 is based on conservative growth of 8 percent; inflation is
projected to remain at 6 percent, reflecting in part the impact of higher inflation in
Russia, Tajikistan’s major trading partner.

•

Fiscal policy is set within a prudent framework, with a deficit of ½ percent of GDP
projected for 2005 (excluding the foreign-financed public investment program). The
fiscal program incorporates a significant increase in the wage bill, from 2.7 percent of
GDP in 2004 to 3.9 percent in 2005. This is largely a catch-up for government
employees, which the authorities deem necessary to retain qualified personnel. It will
also provide the basis for reversing the deterioration in the delivery of social services
and embarking on a comprehensive reform of government administration.

•

Monetary policy will remain prudent with a modest increase in reserve money. The
NBT will develop money market instruments to improve monetary management. The
program also envisages measures to strengthen the banking sector, including the
removal of impediments to the entry of foreign banks.

•

Other structural reforms focus on improving the functioning of the public sector,
creating a better business environment for the private sector, and reinvigorating the
agricultural sector.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
The Executive Board completed the 2002 Article IV consultation and approved a
new three-year PRGF arrangement on December 11, 2002. At that time, Executive
Directors welcomed the steady economic progress made by Tajikistan based on strengthened
ownership and commitment to reform, especially the good fiscal performance in 2001–02
and the focus of monetary policy on reducing inflation. Directors noted that the medium-term
outlook could be complicated by the country’s external debt burden, and stressed the
importance of improved debt management and a comprehensive debt restructuring.
2.
At the time of the third review under the arrangement, completed on
July 21, 2004, Executive Directors commended the authorities for Tajikistan’s
improved economic performance. They also encouraged the authorities to take advantage
of favorable economic conditions to speed up the implementation of key reforms. In
particular, Directors emphasized the importance of expediting governmental reform, focusing
on the education and health sectors. Directors recognized that an increase in real wages in the
context of the 2005 budget would be needed to retain appropriately qualified government
employees.
3.
Parliamentary elections are scheduled for late February and March 2005, and
Presidential elections are scheduled for early 2006. The elections are not expected to
change the orientation of economic policies and reforms.
II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND PERFORMANCE UNDER THE
PRGF-SUPPORTED PROGRAM
A. Overall Trends

government’s reform efforts are
starting to pay off. In addition to

to 68 percent of the 1990 level. The
agricultural and service sectors have
regained their 1990 output level,
reflecting rapid growth in total factor
productivity (see Selected Issues paper),
but the performance of industry has been
weaker, with a rebound only in the
aluminum sector. Fiscal discipline and a
tighter monetary policy have contributed
to a reduction in inflation from
40 percent in 2001 to single digits in
2004.

Nominal GDP grew by a cumulative 70 percent in 2003–04, well above the growth in real
GDP and CPI-inflation. The authorities attribute the rapid increase in the GDP deflator to
increases in producer prices. Reviews by STA of the methodology used to compile nominal
GDP found no major problems.

5.
Notwithstanding many obstacles, the private sector has grown considerably in
recent years, and the banking system has been strengthened. However, progress in a
number of priority reform areas envisaged in the PRSP and the medium-term PRGF strategy
(IMF Country Report No. 03/10) has been slow, especially land and cotton marketing
reforms. More generally, the business environment needs to be improved in order to
stimulate the development of formal private activities, as weak governance has contributed to
continued presence of a large shadow economy.2
6.
There is evidence that poverty has declined significantly in recent years.
According to a recent World Bank update on the poverty situation, strong economic growth
and labor migration have reduced the poverty rate from 81 percent of the population in 1999
to 64 percent in 2003.3 Tajik workers abroad, especially in Russia, Kazakhstan, and Iran,
now account for 25 percent of the Tajik working age population, and have contributed to the
reduction in poverty.
B. Recent Macroeconomic Developments
7.
Macroeconomic developments in 2004 were favorable. Real GDP growth
remained at about 10 percent and inflation fell significantly (Table 1). Economic activity
continued to be fueled by the increase in domestic demand financed by the rapid growth in
worker remittances and by

8.
The general government (excluding the foreign-funded PIP) recorded a small
surplus in 2004 (as in 2003), compared with a deficit of 0.4 percent of GDP envisaged in
the program (Tables 3 and 4). Tax revenue increased slightly to 15.2 percent of GDP in
2004, broadly in line with

the second half of the year. The overall deficit (including the foreign-funded PIP) declined to
2.7 percent of GDP in 2004, and was more than covered by net external concessional
borrowing.
9.
The implementation of monetary policy continued to improve in 2004. In 2003,
the NBT was unable to control base money as it attempted to target the exchange rate by
intervening in the foreign exchange market. Since late 2003, however, the NBT has
successfully focused on stabilizing reserve money growth, which has contributed to reducing
inflation. Externally financed cotton sector credit (75 percent of total private sector credit)
rose rapidly in early 2004, fueled by high cotton prices. This seasonal expansion in credit,
however, has not yet been repaid, partly because of delays in cotton shipments following the
sharp drop in prices in late 2004, in anticipation of higher prices in 2005.

The external current account deficit widened from 1.3 percent of GDP in 2003 to
3.9 percent in 2004, mainly because of the high growth of the economy and delays in cotton
shipments equivalent to 2 percent of GDP. Despite the sharp decline in cotton prices, the
value of exports rose by 19 percent in 2004, reflecting a substantial increase in export
volumes and high aluminum prices. Imports grew at an even faster pace (28 percent), owing
in part to higher fuel costs and increases in inputs for cotton production. At the same time,
workers’ remittances inflows rose substantially, to about 20 percent of GDP. Gross
international reserves increased markedly in dollar terms, but the rapid growth of imports has
kept the import coverage at about 2.0 months.4 After appreciating significantly in late 2003,
the somoni has remained relatively stable against the U.S. dollar. In real effective terms, the
currency depreciated by 5 percent in 2004. Following the completion of legislative
changes to eliminate a few remaining exchange restrictions on current transactions, on
December 9, 2004, Tajikistan accepted the obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and
4 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement.

The authorities have taken determined measures to substantially improve the
external debt profile. As a result of a debt/asset swap with Russia, a debt write-off of
$13 million granted by Pakistan, restraint on new borrowing, and strong economic growth,
the public sector external debt declined from its peak of 130 percent of GDP at end-2000 to
40 percent at end-2004. The debt/asset swap with the Russian Federation, which was signed
in October 2004, reduced Tajikistan’s stock of external debt by $250 million. A further
$50 million will be paid through the budget, on behalf of Russia, as investment in the
Sangtuda hydro-electric project.

The high value of aluminum exports in Q4 2004 should have resulted in larger tax
payments and higher international reserves and tax payments. However, the aluminum
smelter TadAZ incurred substantial tax and utility arrears which explain in part the large
unidentified capital outflow that quarter. The government has now changed TadAZ
management and is in the process of regularizing its finances.

C. Performance Under the Program
12.
Implementation of the second year program under the PRGF arrangement
(October 1, 2003–September 30, 2004) was satisfactory. All the quantitative performance
criteria for end-September 2004 and all but two of the indicative targets for end-December
were observed, some by significant margins, largely because of fiscal over-performance
(Box 1). The indicative target reserve money was exceeded only by a negligible amount.
However, the target for the avoidance of new arrears to utility companies by budget entities
and SOEs was not met, resulting in arrears of about ½ percent of GDP accumulated in the
December quarter, mainly by TadAZ.

and December and $5 million for December).

13.
Structural measures have been implemented, albeit with delays in some cases.
All of the structural performance criteria (which were continuous) were observed. The
July 2004 structural benchmark on education reform was met in September with a 15 percent
reduction in the number of positions (exceeding the 5 percent target). The September
benchmark for enforcing compliance with prudential banking regulations was observed,
although agreement with the state savings bank on a plan to address deficiencies has been
delayed until the source of additional capital for the bank is identified (an injection of private
capital has not been ruled out). However, the audit of Tajikgas (originally set for June 2004)
was only completed in February 2005 owing to some difficulties in securing donor funding.
Moreover, the audit has identified major accounting deficiencies that need to be addressed.
14.
The program has led to a marked improvement in financial sector soundness.
Enforcement of prudential regulations has improved following two years of intensive efforts
that included the breakup and recapitalization of the largest commercial bank and closure of
several small banks. While eight banks violated an average of almost four prudential ratios

each in December 2003, only three banks did not comply with some prudential regulations in
December 2004. This improvement was supported by stepped-up offsite and on-site
supervision. More importantly, bank capitalization has been strengthened significantly, and
the sector continues to consolidate. Also, the authorities are taking steps to implement the
recently approved AML/CFT legislation.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
15.
The authorities stressed their desire to build on the gains made in recent years
toward achieving macroeconomic stability and promoting growth. They considered that
the current policy strategy of financial discipline, especially in the fiscal, monetary, banking,
and external debt management areas, in which they had been very responsive to Fund policy
advice, had been effective at achieving macroeconomic stability and the restoration of
growth. The authorities, however, acknowledged that underlying progress on other structural
areas such as agriculture, energy, public sector management, and governance had been
slower. They emphasized their commitment to completing Tajikistan’s transition to a full
market economy and attached utmost importance to addressing these issues. In particular,
they recognized the need to reform the agricultural sector to reduce rural poverty, as well as
to speed up the reform of the public sector in order to provide social services more
effectively. The authorities cautioned, however, that these reforms needed to be carefully
planned within a medium-term context, owing to the associated complexities and social
sensitivities. They also indicated that they intended to move forward with measures to
improve the business environment, strengthen regional linkages, and improve the country’s
infrastructure by restarting large hydroelectric projects that were initiated during the Soviet
Union period (Box 2).
A. Overall Strategy and Macroeconomic Outlook
16.
Although the medium-term outlook looks favorable, the authorities are
conscious of the many uncertainties ahead. The 2005 program is based on conservative
projections, and factors in the large decline in cotton prices from their peak in early 2004;
aluminum prices are projected to remain buoyant.5 Real GDP growth is projected to remain
robust at 8 percent in 2005, reflecting the start of work in the energy sector and road
infrastructure, before slowing to 6–7 percent a year in 2006–07. Inflation is projected to
remain at 6 percent in 2005, with lower domestic inflation being offset by the impact of
Russian inflation (projected at 10 percent). Remittance income would remain strong, and
improvements in the environment for domestic investment would contribute to diversifying
the economy. The main risks to Tajikistan’s growth prospects in 2005 are related to slower
economic activity in its major economic partners (especially Russia) and, possibly, to lower
prices for the country’s major exports.

In any event, the program prices for both aluminum and cotton are below the January 2005
future prices for December 2005 delivery.

Box 2. Tajikistan—Reestablishing Regional Linkages
Tajikistan has made substantial progress in reestablishing economic relations with neighboring countries,
including former Soviet Union countries, China, Iran, and Pakistan.
Investment. Energy and transport linkages could leverage Tajikistan’s geographical position. In October
2004, the authorities signed a seven-year $1.57 billion investment package with Russian interests
involving: two large hydropower stations, Rogun (with projected investment of $560 million) and
Sangtuda I ($480 million, including possible additional investment from Kazakhstan) with major
construction expected to start in 2006–07; the reconstruction of the TadAZ aluminum smelter
($160 million); and the construction of a new aluminum plant ($600 million). In addition, Iran will
develop the Sangtuda II power station (about $250 million), and is also providing $35 million in
concessional assistance for the construction of the Anzob tunnel to link the central and northern parts of
Tajikistan. The government is also cooperating with China and Pakistan on road links with these
countries. The new roads will provide outlets for new agricultural exports.
Migration. In October 2004, Tajikistan signed an agreement on labor migration with the Russian
Federation to regularize migration rules. The authorities estimate the share of migrant workers at about
17 percent of the economically active population, or 300–400 thousand, with up to 90 percent working in
Russia. The inflow of labor remittances to Tajikistan through the banking system is estimated at
$433 million (21 percent of GDP) in 2004, but may include export proceeds. Remittances from
Tajikistan are estimated at $120 million (7 percent of GDP) and may include import payments.
Regional cooperation. Tajikistan has been actively participating in regional organizations, although
many of these organizations are still at an incipient stage. The main one is the Euro-Asian Economic
Community (Belarus, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Russia, and Tajikistan), which aims to create a
customs union by end-2006.

17.
The third-year program under the PRGF arrangement focuses on maintaining
macroeconomic stability, accelerating public sector reform, and enhancing the business
climate in line with the PRSP (see Box 3). In the fiscal area, tax revenue is expected to
strengthen as a result of the introduction of new tax and customs codes and improvements in
revenue compliance, especially by the major SOEs. Monetary management will be enhanced

- 15 -

Box 3. Tajikistan―Structural Conditionality
Coverage of structural conditionality in the current program
Annex IV of the attached MEFP shows the structural conditionality in the program. The
structural performance criteria cover central bank operations and utility price adjustments as
in the earlier programs. Structural benchmarks for the third annual program relate to revenue
administration, expenditure management, bank debt recoveries, and private external debt
monitoring which are relevant to the macroposition since they should strengthen the fiscal
and external positions. The benchmark for removal of impediments to the entry of foreign
banks is intended to improve the sector’s expertise and service to support investment and
growth. The prior action on government reform and the benchmark for rationalizing strategic
planning, while outside the core area of Fund expertise, draw on technical work by the World
Bank. They were included in the program to give assurances that the wage increase is
accompanied by appropriate reforms to increase efficiency in the government sector.
Status of structural conditionality from earlier programs
Almost all structural conditionality from previous annual programs was implemented.
Although there were some delays, the measures were completed by the time of the
subsequent review. The one exception was the benchmark for the audit of the State Financial
Control Committee, which was replaced by a World Bank-funded twinning arrangement that
is now close to being finalized.
Structural areas covered by world bank lending and conditionality
World Bank projects are in place in the agricultural, education, and health sectors and have
policy components. Public administration, transport, and energy reforms are being discussed
with the authorities in the context of prospective policy based and energy sector credits.
Other relevant structural conditions not included in current program
The resolution of the cotton sector debt is being addressed by the World Bank, AsDB, and
other donors. While the amounts are macroeconomically relevant, the underlying reforms
will have a fundamental effect on agriculture and, thus, these institutions are taking the lead.
However, the program has a benchmark to establish a system to monitor the debt
developments more closely. Specific private sector development issues are being taken up by
an ongoing dialogue between the IFC, UNDP, other donors, and the government.

- 16 -

by introducing appropriate market instruments. In the structural area, the NBT will liberalize
entry into the banking system with the objective of attracting reputable foreign banks.
Moreover, reforms in education, health care, and the core civil service will seek to improve
public administration, governance, and the delivery of social services.
B. Fiscal Policy and Public Sector Reform
The medium-term fiscal framework
18.
The fiscal framework for 2005–07 seeks to contain the overall budget
deficit at 4½–5 percent of GDP (Table 5). These deficits incorporate foreign-financed PIP
spending of 4–4½ percent of GDP based on the utilization of higher external concessional
assistance to support infrastructure investment, given the recent improvement in the debt
profile. Excluding the PIP, the fiscal balance is targeted to shift from a small surplus in 2004
to deficits equivalent to ½ percent of GDP in 2005–07. The program aims to limit net
domestic bank financing to a similar amount so as to allow for adequate credit to the private
sector.
19.
Tax revenue is projected to increase from 15.2 percent of GDP in 2004 to
16.2 percent in 2007. This improvement will be achieved by strengthening tax
administration to broaden the tax base rather than by increasing tax rates, which are already
quite high. On the expenditure side, the wage bill is projected to increase significantly,
from 2.7 percent of GDP in 2004 to 4.3 percent in 2007, in line with the authorities’
objectives of retaining appropriately qualified personnel and beginning to reform the
government, and will be conditional on the availability of revenue. Reflecting these
increases, social spending is expected to rise from 7 percent of GDP in 2004 to just under
10 percent in 2007 in line with the PRSP.
The fiscal program for 2005
20.
In formulating the budget for 2005, the authorities sought to maintain fiscal
discipline while improving participation in defining budget priorities and strengthening
the transparency of the budgetary process. In this regard, the government utilized the
Budget Commission6 to identify the main priorities while allowing for extensive discussions
with parliamentary committees in anticipation of the elections. As a result, the composition
of domestically funded spending was modified significantly relative to the 2004 program. In
particular, savings on low priority capital projects and other current spending were redirected
to allow for a large increase in the wage bill, to 3.9 percent of GDP, in line with the
government’s objectives of addressing the deterioration in governance and the provision of
6

The Budget Commission comprised senior ministers and representatives of the presidential
administration.

- 17 -

social services. Although the revenue target is conservative, the authorities are prepared to
delay some capital spending, if necessary, to ensure that the deficit and bank financing
ceilings are met.
21.
Total revenue is projected to remain unchanged in 2005, with tax revenue
increasing by ½ percentage point of GDP to 15.7 percent of GDP. The increase in tax
revenue is based on a substantial reduction in exemptions and the introduction of: (a) a
minimum tax on enterprises; (b) a unified agricultural tax;7 and (c) the implementation of the
new tax and customs codes (see the accompanying Selected Issues paper). Additional
measures (not factored into the projections) include stricter implementation of the
requirement that TadAZ remain current on its tax and electricity payments (and progressively
pay off its arrears); this would provide additional resources to the electricity utility to meet
its VAT obligations. The implementation of a mechanism to ensure that these funds are
promptly transferred to the treasury is a structural benchmark for March 2005. Also, the large
taxpayer inspectorate will be expanded to cover at least 60 percent of tax collections
(structural benchmark for June 2005). Nontax revenue is projected to decline by ½ percent of
GDP in 2005; this projection is conservative given the ongoing formalization of user charges
in health and education.
22.
Current expenditure in 2005 will remain at the 2004 program level of 14 percent
of GDP.8 However, because the 2004 outturn was lower than programmed, there will be a
catch-up factor compared to the actual outcome. Within this total, the projected increase in
the wage bill will be partly offset by lower administrative expenses and interest payments.
Higher foreign concessional loans to finance the PIP of 4 percent of GDP are justified in
light of the improved debt outlook and the need to finance high priority projects, included in
the PRSP. At the same time, domestically funded capital expenditures will return to their
historical trend.
23.
The proposed wage bill of 3.9 percent of GDP in 2005 implies a 65 percent
increase in nominal terms.9 The average wage increase at the start of 2005 was 50 percent,
but the budget envisages additional funding of 0.1 percent of GDP to cover the cost of Tajik
border guards that will take over from Russian troops the patrolling of the Tajik-Afghan
7

Together, these two new taxes are expected to yield net revenues of 0.3 percent of GDP,
stemming mainly from the application of the minimum tax to TadAZ, which in the past did
not declare profits despite high aluminum prices. Another part of the expected increase in
revenue is associated with the payment of cotton sales taxes that were delayed from 2004
(about 0.2 percent of GDP).
8

The 2005 budget was formulated based on the outcome of the first three quarters of 2004,
while Tables 3–5 show the preliminary outcome for the full year 2004.
9

Even with this increase, the wage bill will only be at about the same level as in 2000 and
significantly below the average 5 percent of GDP for PRGF countries.

- 18 -

border, and of 0.2 percent of GDP to provide selective wage increases in the second half of
the year, conditional on the implementation of additional sector-specific reforms. For the
civil service proper, the wage increases will seek to reduce wage compression. About
70 percent of the increase in the wage bill corresponds to the social sectors.10
24.
In parallel with the wage increase, the government is accelerating the reform of
the public sector (Box 4). A presidential order formalizing this reform was issued in
February 2005 as a prior action under the program. In health and education, the reform
will include a rationalization of resources by shifting the basis for payments to the volume of
services provided rather than the previous level of inputs. These reforms constitute a key
element of the World Bank’s Policy Based Credit, which is expected to be approved in the
third quarter of 2005.
25.
The staff stressed the importance of linking the adjustment in government wages
with the medium-term reform of government administration. It also cautioned the
authorities on the need to avoid raising unrealistic expectations, and to make further
increases conditional on the availability of resources and continued reforms. The authorities
agreed with the staff’s view but noted that, in the social sectors, the government’s strategy of
formalizing user fees and eliminating redundant facilities would provide resources for further
wage increases.
26.
The program for 2005 also includes measures to improve public expenditure
management (with FAD technical assistance). Administrative measures will seek to
enhance communication links between the central branch offices of the treasury in order to
strengthen cash management and forecasting (structural benchmark for September 2005). In
addition, commitment controls will be strengthened for nonroutine payments.
C. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
27.
The authorities are committed to maintaining low inflation. Under the monetary
program for 2005, broad money growth is projected at 18 percent, assuming broadly
unchanged velocity. Consistent with a reduction in inflation, given the lower required reserve
ratio, base money would increase by 10 percent, with gross international reserves rising by
$45 million to raise import coverage to 2.3 months of imports. There will be a small amount
of central bank financing of the government, reflecting the utilization of external program
loans disbursed in 2004. The NBT recognized that it could not rely on budget surpluses, as it
did in 2003–04, to achieve its monetary objectives, and that it would need to monitor

10

The highest increase will apply to the health sector, where wages will rise by 100 percent
from a very low base of about $6 per month.

- 19 -

Box 4. Tajikistan―The Reform of Public Administration
The Tajikistan authorities recognize the importance of reforming public administration for the transition to a
market-based economy. In particular, the distribution of ministerial portfolios as part of the peace agreement for the
civil war, together with low wages, has fostered rent-seeking practices and patronage. A high-level presidential working
group was formed in September 2004 to formulate a comprehensive reform strategy encompassing all elements of
government operations. Recommendations are expected to be ready in the second half of 2005. In parallel, specific
measures have been taken in certain high priority areas that will serve as pilot cases. This box outlines the near-term
measures contained in the presidential order of February 4, 2005. The authorities’ work in this area is being supported
by the World Bank and bilateral donors.
Organization reforms to the civil service
•
The ministry of labor and social protection will be a pilot case in the restructuring process. Following the merger
of three entities, the ministry will take measures to rationalize its operations. The reforms are expected to yield some
staff savings and better field services.
•
The ministry of economy and trade will be rationalized to reduce duplication in development planning, phase out
redundant operations, and refocus its operations in improving the policy environment for private sector development.
The ministry of finance and the ministry of revenue will be subject to functional reorganization.
Information and management reforms
•
The authorities are upgrading the personnel management system. The central register of civil service positions,
which has been completed, identifies about 15,000 positions at the central and local government levels. The register of
civil service staff is expected to be completed by April 2005. Competitive civil service recruitment has started and the
new procedures will be reviewed in mid-2005.
•
Budget and cash management will be strengthened. The treasury system will also be adapted to a more
decentralized financial management for the social sectors.
Social sectors
•
Funding reforms in the education and health sectors include formalizing fees (which became legal after a
constitutional amendment in 2003), changing the funding formula away from the amount of inputs (workers, beds, etc.)
to output in terms of the services provided (students or patients), and decentralizing decision-making.
•
The reform strategy for the education sector is set out in the June 2004 reform plan for 2004–09. Cuts in
positions, averaging 15 percent, were implemented in September 2004. However, as low wages had resulted in many
vacancies, the cuts in positions did not produce many staff redundancies. Pilot programs have been initiated in five
districts, including some large towns. These programs use school-based budgeting and mixed private and public
funding.

•

After adopting a healthcare reform strategy in 2003, the authorities are finalizing the health financing mechanism.
This was piloted in two districts, which successfully boosted primary healthcare (as opposed to hospital-based
treatment) and implemented a guaranteed benefits package, copayments for some services, and service-based funding.
In 2005, the pilots will be extended to three larger districts, including Dushanbe, which are expected to lead to a
rationalization of hospital facilities and related staff.

- 20 -

monetary developments closely to avoid a reemergence of inflationary pressures. Given the
limited availability of instruments for withdrawing liquidity, the NBT will refrain from
providing any financing to banks, except as lender of last resort, and only at penalty rates.
28.
The NBT identified the development of market instruments and an effective
interbank market as a key structural objective for 2005. The NBT agreed with the staff
on the urgency of developing a securities market, including by converting some of the
government securities held in its portfolio into marketable instruments. As a first step, MOF
will issue SM 3 million of short-term treasury securities in the second quarter of 2005 that
could be used in the secondary market to collateralize interbank loans.
29.
The monetary program provides sufficient room for credit to the private sector.
To support credit expansion, after relaxing liquidity requirements in 2004, the authorities
will progressively reduce reserve requirements from the current level of 18 percent. Total
private sector credit will be flat for the year because of the delayed repayment of cotton
sector credits (Table 7). Other commercial bank credit, however, will grow strongly. Legal
changes to facilitate the use of land as bank collateral are expected to facilitate access to
credit by the rural sector.
30.
The staff considers appropriate the NBT’s policy of maintaining a managed
floating exchange rate regime, with intervention aimed at meeting the international
reserve targets and smoothing short-term exchange rate volatility. The staff is of the
view that external competitiveness remains adequate, given the strong growth of exports and
the relatively low level of wages in Tajikistan, even allowing for the lower productivity.
D. Financial Sector Issues
31.
The NBT is taking steps to further strengthen the financial system. The
authorities are raising the minimum capital requirements for banks to $5 million in 2005–06,
which is likely to encourage further consolidation of the system. The reductions in the
liquidity and required reserve ratios are intended to release more resources for lending
(following the more effective enforcement of prudential regulations), as well as to narrow the
spread between lending and deposit rates (currently at 12 percent for short-term loans). The
mission stressed the need for the NBT to review the existing infrastructure supporting
commercial bank operations, including by strengthening the monitoring of credit quality. In
particular, it encouraged the authorities to facilitate the establishment of a bankers’
association and a credit bureau. To strengthen its balance sheet, the NBT intends to sell part
of the collateral on nonperforming loans provided in the mid-1990s as directed credits
(structural benchmark for June 2005).
32.
The authorities shared the staff’s view that further strengthening of the banking
system will require the entry of reputable foreign banks. The existing banks are too small
and inexperienced to cover the growing demand for financial services. In this regard, the

- 21 -

authorities plan to relax the remaining restrictions on the entry of foreign banks to the Tajik
market (structural benchmark for June 2005), in particular, the elimination of the ceiling on
foreign capital participation and the requirement that Tajik nationals head banks operating in
the country.
33.
The accumulation of a high level of debt by the cotton sector is undermining the
solvency of a large financial institution and stifling agricultural reform. This situation
arose because of poor incentives for state farms, collusion by creditors and cotton processors
that resulted in farms being granted unfavorable terms, and expectations by some creditors
that the government would eventually assume these debts. Indeed, during 2004 the external
debt rose from $92 million at the start of the year to $150 million at end-2004 (7½ percent of
GDP). Donors and the government are working on a mechanism to resolve this problem on a
loan-by-loan basis without resorting to government guarantees, which is expected to be in
place in the near future. Fund staff will monitor closely the outcome of the discussions. Other
measures to reduce distortions in the cotton sector include the elimination of the allocation of
land to cotton production and of sub-national cotton production plans, and the acceleration of
farm privatization.
E. External Policies and Debt Management
34.
While recent debt reduction agreements have eased the external debt burden,
the staff stressed the importance of preserving debt sustainability and ensuring an
efficient use of external resources. Under a medium-term baseline scenario with the PIP at
4½ percent of GDP, an updated debt sustainability analysis indicates that the public sector
external debt would not exceed 40 percent of GDP over the medium term, and that the debt
service-to-revenue ratio will stay at below 15 percent, a sustainable level based on historical
experience (see Selected Issues for details). However, Tajikistan’s debt position remains
highly vulnerable to exogenous shocks, especially to exports, and requires sound
macroeconomic policies to remain sustainable.
35.
The authorities agreed with the staff’s assessment and indicated that they would
restrain foreign-financed disbursements under the PIP and carefully evaluate projects
to ensure their effectiveness, as well as their consistency with PSRP, absorptive
capacity, and debt sustainability. The authorities also intend to pursue further debt
regularization and restructuring with the remaining bilateral creditors while ensuring a high
degree of concessionality for new borrowing, in line with the program. They also undertook
to refrain from issuing financial guarantees to foreign investors, in particular for large energy
projects. In addition, the MOF will move expeditiously to start using a computerized system
for debt tracking, forecasting, and budget planning. The NBT will start to monitor private
sector external debt, focusing initially on the cotton sector.

- 22 -

36.
The authorities are seeking to reestablish regional trade linkages in parallel
with fuller integration within the multilateral trade system. 11The mission supported the
authorities’ trade liberalization agenda and urged them to ensure that regional initiatives do
not result in higher protection for imports from third countries. Despite many attempts at
resolution, bottlenecks remain in trade and transit with Uzbekistan (about 95 percent of
Tajikistan’s trade is transported by railroad through Uzbekistan). The mission encouraged the
authorities to continue searching for a mutually acceptable solution to this problem.
F. Other Structural Policies and Issues
37.
The weak business environment constitutes the main obstacle to economic
diversification and sustained poverty reduction. The authorities are committed to
liberalizing key services, but concrete actions are also needed to permit reputable
international airlines and telecommunication companies to enter the market, and to move
ahead with the banking reforms referred to earlier. A recent IFC mission provided advice on
reducing the scope of business regulations.
38.
Structural weaknesses in the energy sector continue to be a drag on growth.
Although natural gas prices are broadly consistent with cost recovery, electricity tariffs need
to be increased by 400 percent (to $0.02 per KWh) to reach cost recovery and make the
electricity sector financially viable and lay the foundation the new large projects. A
World Bank proposal, supported by the staff, for quarterly increases in electricity tariffs to
reach this level over a period of about five years is being considered by the authorities as
well as social safety nets (Box 5). They have also committed to reducing losses by extending
metering of gas and electricity, and to improving collections by reforming the payment
mechanism between TadAZ and the electricity utility to ensure TadAZ remains current on its
electricity and tax payments.
39.
The authorities have responded positively to the proposals made in the Joint
Staff Assessment of the First Annual Progress Report on the PRSP. In particular, they
have started to address deficiencies in public expenditure management and prioritization,
including through the establishment of the Budget Commission. Steps have also been taken
to reduce duplication in the government and provide better incentives for government
workers. The authorities intend to develop a closer link between the next PRSP and the
forthcoming five-year plan.
40.
The authorities are making progress in improving the quality and transparency
of economic information. Tajikistan subscribed to the GDDS and posted metadata on its
key statistics in November 2004. Although the overall quality, periodicity, and timeliness of
the data are sufficient for macroeconomic management, further improvements are needed in
11

Tajikistan has a relatively open trade regime, with an average tariff of 8 percent and no
significant nontariff barriers.

- 23 -

the national accounts, especially by developing the expenditure categories. In addition, the
authorities need to do much more to improve fiscal accountability, including by increasing
the availability of fiscal information and statistics to the general public, particularly the
details of the 2005 budget and tax and business-related legislation.

Box 5. Tajikistan―Poverty and Social Impact of Electricity Tariff Increases
The poverty and social impact of electricity tariff increases is being analyzed in parallel
with the policy discussion on tariff increases. In collaboration with the World Bank, an
expert from the PSIA group in FAD prepared a preliminary analysis (summarized in Selected
Issues) in advance of the Bank’s more comprehensive study. Using existing information on
the consumption basket, a 400 percent increase in electricity tariffs would directly reduce
real income for the average household by 6.8 percent and by about 8.2 percent for the poorest
quintile. There would also be some additional indirect effects, especially on the prices of
food and services. At the same time, there would be income growth over the five-year
implementation period, and welfare gains from a more stable electricity supply.
Various methods were reviewed to ameliorate the impact of the tariff increase on the
poor. Two formulations of lifeline tariffs were examined, as well as cash transfers based on
some standard criteria known to be associated with low income. The review found that
lifeline tariffs would not be well targeted at the poor. However, while cash transfers can
produce better targeting in the simulations, this has to be balanced against implementation
constraints and the associated administrative costs, especially if the payment per household is
likely to be relatively small. Given that improvements in the effectiveness of existing social
safety net programs, including the Energy Compensation Mechanism, would be gradual,
phased increases in prices and transitional lifeline tariffs could be part of a tariff reform
package.

41.
During the late 1990s through 2001, Tajikistan received a significant amount of
technical assistance in tax and expenditure administration, statistics, and financial
sector operations. Near-term implementation was relatively slow, partly because of
institutional weaknesses and lingering instability at that time, and many recommendations
are still being implemented. The authorities noted that use of separate short-term missions
did not provide sufficient implementation assistance and they preferred longer-term resident
or peripatetic advisers. They pointed to the successful assistance in the drafting of the new
tax code provided by the Legal Department as an example of consistency of support over a
three-year period. Also resident advisors funded by the USAID have been instrumental in
strengthening the banking system.

- 24 -

IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
42.
Over the past two years, Tajikistan has made considerable progress in
sustaining strong economic growth and securing a marked reduction in inflation.
Economic liberalization, strong fiscal discipline, and improved monetary management
supported by the PRGF have underpinned this success. The authorities have also been
successful at rebuilding relations with neighboring countries. This has improved the
country’s employment and investment prospects and contributed to poverty reduction and
debt relief. Despite these positive developments, the authorities face major challenges in the
transition process, especially to deepen structural reforms and improve governance. They
should also be prepared to address negative shocks appropriately.
43.
A prudent fiscal policy will be key to maintaining macroeconomic stability.
Regarding tax revenue, the authorities will need to remain vigilant to ensure that the program
targets are achieved. Prompt implementation of the new tax and customs codes, together with
other revenue administration reforms, will be critical to improve compliance and broaden the
tax base. Given the prospective expansion of the energy/aluminum sector, ensuring
compliance with tax and utility payments by the current SOEs will be essential to boost
revenue and establish an appropriate governance environment.
44.
The budget for 2005 incorporates a substantial increase in the wage bill within
an appropriate overall expenditure framework. The large wage increase reflects the
authorities’ objectives of retaining qualified staff and beginning to improve the quality of
government services. While the staff considers that there are risks attached to this strategy,
the wage increase is expected to have a positive impact on the performance of the civil
service, as well as the health and education sectors, and would facilitate the implementation
of deeper reforms. These reforms will need to ensure that staffing levels and facilities are
rationalized to improve efficiency, and given their complexity and sensitive nature, should be
carefully sequenced over the medium term. Measures envisaged in the program to strengthen
the treasury and cash management will help increase accountability and improve expenditure
management.
45.
Recent improvements in monetary policy have contributed to bringing inflation
under control. In the near term, the authorities should be vigilant to ensure that this success
is continued, particularly in light of the need for some domestic financing of the government.
In the medium term, the authorities should work toward deepening financial intermediation
and further strengthening the banking system, especially by removing the impediments to the
entry of reputable foreign banks and by gradually liberalizing restraints on credit growth as
compliance with prudential regulations improves.
46.
The staff is of the view that the managed floating exchange rate regime is
appropriate and the level of external competitiveness is adequate. Tajikistan’s
acceptance of the obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 is welcome.

47.
The staff commends the authorities' success at reducing the external debt
obligations to manageable levels through effective negotiations and prudent new
borrowing. The improved external debt profile provides some cushion but needs to be
accompanied by a more transparent prioritization of the PIP and strengthened external debt
management systems.
48.
The authorities need to accelerate structural reforms to sustain growth and
poverty reduction. The agriculture sector is in need of rapid modernization, including
through the progressive elimination of distortions. In particular, interference by local
governments into farm and enterprise activities should be discontinued. To complement these
reforms, the debt overhang of the cotton sector should be addressed decisively. The staff
supports the government’s intention to do this without recourse to government guarantees.
49.
In the energy sector, further progress is needed to make the sector financially
viable. Improving collection rates for gas and electricity use are a start. Electricity rates
should be increased in stages to long-term cost recovery levels in order to ensure adequate
resources for maintenance and the expansion of electricity generation capacity. The
expressions of interest in the energy/aluminum sector by foreign investors are welcome.
Establishing the appropriate governance, financial, and fiscal frameworks for the sector will
be key to ensuring additional budgetary revenue that could be used for poverty reduction.
50.
The ongoing reestablishment of regional economic links for goods, labor, and
capital constitutes a major contribution to growth. Further regional efforts to eliminate
the remaining impediments to the transshipment of goods would contribute to expanding
trade and improving growth prospects.
51.
The authorities should continue to strive to improve public sector transparency
and governance. Reflecting the spirit of the PRSP process, the government has taken
positive steps to increase participation by parliamentarians and the business community
during the discussions on the 2005 budget and the new tax and customs codes. Further
progress could be made in this area by improving public access to key legislation, the
detailed fiscal accounts, and other statistical data.
52.
The staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation with Tajikistan take place
on the 24-month cycle.

APPENDIX I

Safeguards Assessments

Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, the National Bank of Tajikistan (NBT) is
subject to a full safeguards assessment with respect to the PRGF arrangement approved on
December 11, 2002. The assessment was completed on July 23, 2003 and included specific
measures to address a number of weaknesses, mainly in the areas of financial accounting and
reporting and auditing procedures. The NBT is implementing the recommendations of the
safeguards assessment according to plan. These measures are being monitored by staff under
the current PRGF arrangement.
IX.

Exchange Rate Arrangements

The NBT maintains a managed floating exchange rate regime with no pre-announced path
for the exchange rate. With effect from December 9, 2004, the Republic of Tajikistan
accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Articles of Agreement.
The authorities amended the law on Foreign Exchange Regulation and Foreign Exchange
Control to incorporate the definition of current account transactions, which is consistent with
Article VIII. The NBT has also abolished its Instruction on the Procedure for Opening and
Keeping Foreign Exchange Accounts of Legal Entities and Individuals to eliminate the
procedures for forced debiting of foreign exchange accounts. Tajikistan has notified the Fund
the restriction on current account transactions resulting from its joining the UN International
Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism (1999) and its adherence to
UN Security Council Resolution 1267 (1999); (b) UN Security Council Resolution 1373
(September 28, 2001); and (c) the list of current terrorist organizations designated by the
U.S. Secretary of State. On August 12, 2002, the NBT revised the calculation of the official
exchange rate to include all inter-bank transactions in foreign exchange. Since November
2001, the authorities have been setting the official exchange rate once a week based on a
weighted average of exchange rates in the official interbank market.
X.

Article IV Consultation

The 2004 Article IV consultation discussions were held from December 2–14, 2004. The
2002 Article IV report, dated November 13, 2002, was considered by the Executive Board on
December 11, 2002. Tajikistan is on the 24-month consultation cycle, subject to the
provisions of the decision on consultation cycles approved on July 15, 2002.

TAJIKISTAN: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
(As of January 29, 2005)
Country Director: Mr. Dennis N. de Tray, Telephone: (202) 473-3544
A. Partnership in Tajikistan’s development strategy
1.
The government’s poverty reduction strategy, embodied in its first full PRSP, was
endorsed by the IMF and ODA Boards in December 2002. The strategy comprises four
elements: (a) sustainable growth; (b) improved governance; (c) better provision of basic
social services; and (d) targeted support for the poor. While the PRSP’s overall direction was
considered appropriate by the IMF and IDA Boards, lack of prioritization was identified as a
major weakness. The Country Assistance Strategy, approved by the Bank’s Board of
Executive Directors on February 27, 2003, recognizes this concern by emphasizing
selectivity.
2.
Macroeconomic management aims at establishing a stable economic environment
through appropriate fiscal, monetary, exchange rate, and sustainable debt policies. In support
of these policies, the authorities are tightening payment discipline, especially in the energy
sector, hardening budget constraints for state-owned enterprises, and pursuing enterprise and
banking privatization and restructuring. Recent improvements in macroeconomic
management have supported the current economic recovery, although maintaining strong
growth will depend importantly on accelerating structural reform to enhance private sector
development and to encourage foreign and domestic investment.
3.
The IMF has taken the lead in assisting Tajikistan in enhancing macroeconomic
stability. In this regard, the Fund has encouraged the authorities to continue with fiscal
consolidation, maintain a restrictive monetary policy stance, and restructure external debt to
reduce the heavy burden and to enhance debt sustainability. The Fund has supported
Tajikistan’s economic reform program since 1996. During January–June 2002, the
authorities successfully implemented a Staff Monitored Program, which formed the basis of a
new Fund-supported program under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF),
approved by the Executive Board in December 2002. The program covers the period
October 1, 2002–September 30, 2005; the first review was completed on July 18, 2003.
4.
The World Bank has taken the lead in the policy dialogue on structural issues,
including poverty reduction measures, agriculture sector reforms, private sector
development, institution building, and governance. A range of instruments is used to conduct
the dialogue. Policy-based lending is supporting a multisectoral structural reform agenda,
supported by technical assistance as appropriate. The second tranche of SAC2 was disbursed
in summer 2004 and the Second Institution Building Technical Assistance Credit (IBTA2)
will close shortly. The Policy Based Credit (PBC) currently under preparation will engage
the government in the areas of public sector reform in close coordination with the IMF,

- 48 -

APPENDIX II

private sector development, and trade and transport. This broad-based approach is combined
with sector projects in rural infrastructure and power, agriculture, environment, health,
education, and poverty alleviation. The Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR),
the Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA), and the Public Expenditure and
Institutional Review (PEIR) have been finalized in collaboration with the government of
Tajikistan. A Trade Diagnostic Study (TDS), and an Investment Climate Assessment are
being finalized. Additionally, a new Poverty Assessment Report and a health sector note
have been prepared. The health sector note identifies priority areas for reform of the health
sector, a much needed strengthening of primary health care in particular.

APPENDIX II

5.
The next section describes the Bank program and the division of responsibility
between the two institutions. In a number of areas—social sectors, environment, and
infrastructure—the Bank takes the lead in the dialogue and there is no cross conditionality
with the IMF-supported program. The Bank is also leading the dialogue on private sector and
agriculture sector reform, and Bank analysis serves as input into the Fund program. In other
areas—energy, financial sector, public expenditure management, public sector—both
institutions work together and share cross conditionality. Finally, in areas such as monetary
policy, tax policy, and customs the IMF takes the lead with little Bank involvement.
B. World Bank collaboration in specific areas
Areas in which the World Bank leads and there is little direct IMF involvement
6.
Areas in which the Bank leads and there is no direct IMF involvement are social
sectors, infrastructure, and environment. In the social sphere, the Bank has carried out
regular Poverty Assessments to monitor poverty and develop programs to alleviate poverty.
Based on the completed Living Standards Assessment (2003), a Poverty Assessment
Report has been prepared. Two Poverty Alleviation Projects have supported capacity
development at the national and local level to implement participatory approaches to poverty
alleviation and improve the access of the poor to essential economic and social services. In
addition, the second Poverty Alleviation Project has provided support to vulnerable people
through micro-projects, micro-finance services, and community empowerment.
7.
In education, the Bank focuses on both addressing policy issues and utilizing
IDA credit funds for solid investments. The ongoing Education Reform LIL and the
Education Modernization Project (FY03), aim to upgrade the basic education system
through: (a) building capacity for change by involving continued support for strategic
changes in curriculum and textbook production and supporting improved management and
finance at the national level; and (b) supporting local initiatives for infrastructure and quality
improvement, support for textbook rental schemes and book printing, and provision of
equipment at the local level. The IMF has supported the education reform process, in close
collaboration with the World Bank, through a structural benchmark requiring the drawing up
of a fully costed education reform plan by the government.
8.
In health, the Bank is focusing on: (a) rationalizing the delivery of the basic health
services based on the needs of the population in selected districts, especially in remote areas
where the poorest are located; (b) reform the public health services, with particular emphasis
on prevention of major communicable diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS;
and (c) further strengthening the institutional capability (both at the center and district levels)
to carry out health care reforms, improve the system for budgeting and spending for basic
health services, and control outbreaks of communicable diseases and prevent HIV/AIDS
epidemic from spreading. The ongoing Primary Health Care Project and the proposed
Community and Basic Health Project (FY05) (under preparation) are the main instruments
for the implementation of this agenda.

- 50 -

APPENDIX II

9.
With regard to infrastructure development, the Bank is concentrating on upgrading
basic utility services impacting the population at large and especially the poor. The Dushanbe
Water Supply Project is helping the Dushanbe Municipality and the local water company to
address the most critical deficiencies of water supply services. The Pamir Private Power
Project, is supporting improvements in reliability and of electricity supply in the Gorno
Badakshan region through private sector participation. The Rural Infrastructure
Rehabilitation Project aims to increase water supply and efficiency of irrigation systems to
newly privatized farms, develop institutional capacity in land and water resources
management, and improve the quality of drinking water in selected villages.
10.
Environment. The Bank has supported programs to improve environmental
management and to deal with natural disasters. A National Environment Action Plan was
developed with the Bank’s help. The Emergency Flood Assistance and Lake Sarez Risk
Mitigation Projects have helped the government to mitigate the consequences of frequent
natural disasters and to build national capacity to increase government’s preparedness to
frequent natural hazards such as mudslides, rockfalls, avalanches, and seasonal floods.
Areas in which the World Bank leads and its analysis serves as input into the
IMF program
11.
The Bank leads the dialogue on structural reforms through the PBC currently under
preparation. After initial delays, the second and final tranche of the previous SAC2 was
disbursed in June 2004 after the relevant conditions had been successfully met, including
conditions on privatization and the energy arrears of the aluminum smelter TadAZ. Institution
building and technical assistance in support of structural reforms continue to be provided by
IBTA 2 and the Farm Privatization Support Project. The Bank leads in areas of:
(i)

Private sector development, including new measures for financial transparency and
hard budget constraints, establishment of a new agency to support the private sector
and improvements in the regulatory framework, and reduction of taxes on the
agricultural sector. The Bank is conducting an Investment Climate Review to
determine the most important impediments to private sector development.

(ii)

Privatization and enterprise reforms and farm privatization, including
acceleration of privatization of medium and large enterprises, development of a plan
to engage the private sector in Tajikistan’s strategic enterprises and adoption of a
strategy to privatize these enterprises in a medium-term context, improvements to the
corporate governance framework public enterprises; upgrading of the status of the
Land Reform Committee to the equivalent of a ministry and acceleration of farm
privatization and enforcement of procedures to ensure the transparency and equitable
privatization of farm land; development of procedures and institutional mechanisms at
the state level and selected regions to ensure fair and equitable transfer of land and
other farm assets to private individuals or groups; creation of sustainable private
family farming units and providing them with the enabling conditions to operate
independently in a market economy.

- 51 -

(iii)

APPENDIX II

Regulatory reforms, including separation of Tajik Air’s organizational structure into
three different business units in preparation for privatization of the airline.

12.
While the Bank has taken the lead in privatization and in structural reforms in the
private sector as described above, the IMF has also a strong interest in these areas since
many of these reforms are critical to achieving macroeconomic stabilization and enhancing
growth prospects. Accordingly, there is a high degree of consultation and coordination
between the two institutions on these matters.
Areas of shared responsibility
13.
The Bank and the Fund are working jointly in the following four main areas
(supported by the Bank’s PBC, grants, and several investment operations and the Fund’s
PRGF):
(i)

Public sector management. This area includes public administration reforms aimed
at redefining the role of the state in line with the market economy needs, reorganizing
key ministries, strengthening the Financial Control Office responsible for audit the
budget, and supporting customs administration reforms. The Bank is involved in civil
service reform while the Fund is providing technical assistance in support of tax and
customs administration.

(ii)

Budget planning and execution. Both institutions work on providing support for a
national treasury, adoption of new law on public finances introducing modern
budgetary procedures and improved fiscal management; including Public Investment
Program and switching from norm-based costing and allocation of expenditures to
activity/population based in education and health sectors.

(iii)

Financial sector reforms. This area includes the acceleration of financial sector
restructuring and closure of weak banks, new regulatory framework for the
establishment of nonbank intermediaries; significant changes in the tax code making
tax authorities’ access to bank accounts conditional on a court authorization. In terms
of banking supervision, the IMF is monitoring the closure and merger of banks that
do not satisfy prudential requirements.

(iv)

Utilities reform. The Fund has included in the PRGF arrangement conditionality
related to energy tariff rates, energy arrears, and collection rates with the aim to
reduce quasi-fiscal activities and increase transparency. The Bank’s program supports
this objective, with a focus on enhancing market structures, improved enterprise
operation, service delivery, as well as financial performance. The Bank completed an
Energy Sector Utility Reform Review in 2004 which describes the financial condition
of the energy sector enterprises and details the Bank’s energy sector development
strategy into the medium term. It is also working closely together with the Asian
Development Bank and the EBRD in the areas of utilities reform and restructuring of
strategic enterprises such as the railways and airlines.

- 52 -

APPENDIX II

Areas in which the IMF leads and its analysis serves as input into the
World Bank program
14.
The Fund leads the dialogue on fiscal matters, setting the overall envelope for public
expenditures. The World Bank’s work in key sectors, such as health, education, and
infrastructure, necessitates close cooperation. In addition to the achievement of overall fiscal
targets, the Fund-supported PRGF includes structural benchmarks and performance criteria
prohibiting the National Bank of Tajikistan (NBT) from issuing directed credit, from making
expenditures not related to its core business activities, and from paying dividends while it has
negative net worth. This also includes finalization of an inventory of guarantees, pledges, and
other contingencies of NBT.
15.
In the budgetary area, the Fund is taking the lead on tax reforms and treasury systems
development. The IMF also leads the dialogue on polices to rationalize and contain
expenditures in the public sector. These include policies regarding wage-setting in both the
public service and defining the ceiling for public investment expenditures.
16.
In these areas, the Bank takes into account the policy recommendations of the IMF
and ensures that its own policy advice is consistent.
Areas in which the IMF leads and there is no direct World Bank involvement
17.
The Fund takes the lead in the formulation and execution of fiscal and monetary
policies, external policies, and issues involving economic and financial statistics. However,
the World Bank has provided a grant ($350,000) financed by the Trust Fund for Statistical
Capacity and Institutional Building to strengthen the National Statistics Service
(Gozkomsatat). On trade issues, the Bank is finalizing a Trade Diagnostic Study which will
lead to closer collaboration in this area.
C. World Bank Group Strategy
18.
The World Bank Group Strategy and future proposed lending operations are
elaborated in the CAS discussed by the Board of Directors on February 27, 2003. It focuses
on three key areas which are consistent with the PRSP:
•
•
•

building long-term institutions geared toward a market economy;
generating growth with equity through private sector development; and
addressing the pressing needs of the population through greater involvement at the
local community level and support the efficient functioning of basic communal
infrastructure (including schools, health facilities and other basic services).

19.
Tajikistan is currently in the Base Case Scenario in which IDA provides up to
$80 million. This level of lending is lower than in the past due to phasing out of Tajikistan’s
status as a transition country in a post-conflict situation. A new CAS is under preparation and
will be adopted in 2005.

APPENDIX III

TAJIKISTAN: RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of January 29, 2005)
Country Director: Ms. Kazuko Motomura Telephone: 992-372-210558/235314/235315
1.
Tajikistan became a member of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in 1998. The
ADB has participated in the Consultative Group Meeting for Tajikistan since 1998. After
conducting an initial mission in June 1998, ADB completed an Economic Report and Interim
Operational Strategy that identified three areas: (a) agriculture; (b) infrastructure
rehabilitation (especially energy and transport sectors); and (c) social sector, in which ADB
assistance would have the greatest development impact. Based on the Interim Strategy,
ADB’s Board of Directors approved in October 1998 Tajikistan’s country classification,
which provides the basis for Tajikistan’s full access to concessional resources (Asian
Development Fund: (ADF). Based on the new ADF replenishment arrangements completed
in 2004, Tajikistan is eligible in receiving 40 percent of the loan amount on grant basis after
2005.
2.
In view of Tajikistan’s urgent need for assistance in 1998, in coordination with the
IMF and the World Bank, the ADB provided a Postconflict Infrastructure Program Loan
(PIPL) ($20 million), which was designed to create a framework for developing
market-based transport and energy sectors. The loan was for two years and was fully
disbursed by end-2000. Based on the satisfactory progress of the PIPL conditionality, the
following loans were approved in these two sectors:
•

Transport sector: the Road Rehabilitation Project loan ($20 million in 2000), which
rehabilitates the most deteriorated sections of the Dushanbe, Kulyab road in the
southern part of Tajikistan, the most civil-war affected areas; and the first phase of
Dushanbe - Kyrgyz Border Road Rehabilitation Project loan ($15 million in 2003),
which improves Tajikistan’s transportation link toward north and east through the
Kyrgyz Republic, further to Kazakhstan and Russia as well as to the People’s
Republic of China. These projects also improve rural roads in the project areas. The
second phase of the Dushanbe-Kyrgyz Border Road Rehabilitation Project loan is
being prepared for the ADB Board approval in 2005. Continued supports in
strengthening the government’s institutional capacity for efficient management of
national road network are provided under technical assistance grants associated with
these loans.

•

Power sector: the Power Rehabilitation Project loan ($34 million in 2000), which
aims to improve people’s quality of life and support poverty reduction by increasing
the availability of electricity and assist in post-conflict recovery of Tajikistan’s
economy (the project rehabilitates and reinforces power transmission and distribution
facilities in the war-damaged areas in Khatlon and Dushanbe regions, and
rehabilitates the Nurek Power Plant and Central Hydropower Plant); and the Regional
Power Transmission Modernization Project loan ($20 million in 2002), which is
geared toward improving the reliability and the operation of the Central Asian power
transmission system, enhancing the intercountry power trading between Tajikistan

- 54 -

APPENDIX III

and Uzbekistan, and laying the foundation for a future wholesale regional power
market. Various technical assistance were provided to accelerate market-oriented
reforms in the power sector in line with IMF and Bank programs and for supporting
the government in formulating a power sector development strategy. The second
Power Rehabilitation Project loan is being prepared for ADB Board approval in 2006.
3.
In addition to the above, the ADB Board approved to date the following loans to
Tajikistan in each sector:
•

Social sector: the Social Sector Rehabilitation Project loan ($20 million in 1999) to
address the serious deterioration in living standards and strengthen the delivery of
essential social services; the Health Sector Reform Project loan ($7.5 million in
2003), which aims to improve health, especially of the poor, women, and children by
providing pro-poor health service package, and by reforming the health service
delivery and financing mechanism; and the Education Sector Reform Project loan
($7.5 million in 2003), which focuses on supporting the government’s reform
priorities in primary (grades 1–4) and general secondary education (grades 5–11) by
improving the education system and its management. These two social sector reform
loans are being supported by respective grants financed by Japan Fund for Poverty
Reduction (JFPR): (a) the project for Community Participation and Public
Information Campaign for Health Improvement ($1 million in 2004) and (b) the
School Improvement Project ($2 million in 2004), which aims to increase access to
improved education for children, particularly girls, of poor families and vulnerable
groups.

•

Agriculture sector: based on the agriculture sector assessment prepared during
1999–2000, the Agriculture Rehabilitation Project loan ($35 million in 2002) is being
implemented to improve living conditions of the farming communities in the project
area and to institute measures to sustain benefits of improvements for irrigation and
drainage systems and water supply as well as by providing farm production support
services. In order to support the agriculture sector reforms, the Technical Assistance
for Farm Debt Resolution and Policy Reforms, which is associated with the loan, has
been implemented in consultation with the IMF, involving a wide range of
stakeholders. Based on the findings of the TA, ADB supports the government in close
cooperation with other donors and NGOs for formulating a National Farm Debt
Resolution Strategy. A wide range of donor assistance will be needed once the
Strategy will be announced by the government. Grant assistance for Rural Poverty
Reduction Project ($2.9 million in 2001) financed by JFPR has supported the loan
preparation and implementation by pilot testing innovative poverty-oriented on- and
off-farm supports. An Irrigation Rehabilitation Project loan of $22.7 million is being
processed for approval in 2004.

•

Finance: Microfinance Systems Development Program loan ($4 million in 2003) to
support policy, legal, and regulatory reforms; and Microfinance Systems
Development Project loan ($4 million in 2003) to help transform nongovernmental

- 55 -

APPENDIX III

organization microfinance programs into licensed and regulated microfinance
institutions.
•

Other sectors: the Regional Trade Facilitation and Customs Cooperation Program
loan ($10 million in 2002), which supports trade and customs reform development
across the East and Central Asia. Subject to adequate progress in policy reforms, a
project loan for customs modernization and infrastructure development will follow.

•

Emergency assistance: in response to the Government’s urgent requests, three
emergency loans, including the Emergency Flood Rehabilitation Project loan
($5 million in 1999), the Emergency Restoration of Yavan Water Conveyance System
loan ($3.6 million in 2001), and the Emergency Baipaza Landslide Stabilization
Project loan ($5.3 million in 2002) were approved.

4.
ADB prepares and updates its three-year rolling programs for Tajikistan every year in
consultation with the government based on the ADF resources availability, carefully
examining the country’s social and economic development status and in coordination with
other donors, including the IMF. As of end October 2004, in addition to the above 15 loans,
totaling $210.9 million, and three JFPR grant projects, totaling $5.9 million, ADB provided
38 technical assistance grants, totaling $19 million to support policy reforms, capacity
building, and project implementation.
5.
In end 2000, ADB started supporting the government in developing PRSP through
participatory approach under a TA grant in close cooperation with the IMF, Bank, and
UNDP. Following the finalization of the PRSP in June 2002, ADB concluded the Poverty
Partnership Agreement (PPA) with the Government in December 2002, and proceeded to
prepare a new five-year Country Strategy and Program (CSP) for 2004–08 for Tajikistan,
which was endorsed by the ADB Board in October 2003. In view of the current challenging
circumstances for development, including the limited borrowing capacity of Tajikistan, the
CSP was not able to support all areas identified in the PRSP and the PPA. Its main objectives
are (a) to strengthen rural development through institution building that will support policy
implementation and the private sector; (b) to rehabilitate power and rural infrastructure; and
(c) to strengthen regional cooperation through improved customs services and transport links,
both within the country and neighboring ones. ADB pays full attention to the progress of
Tajikistan’s MDG achievement, however, in view of the ceiling on borrowing for the PIP
and an expected inflow of grant funds committed for social sectors during the last
consultative group (CG) meeting, ADB plans to remain involved in the social sector through
only nonlending operations, enabling it to take part in policy dialogue, follow sector
developments, and resume lending in the sector if required. The actual lending level needs to
be determined by (a) availability of overall ADF resources, (b) country performance
assessment vis-à-vis ADB’s policy on performance based allocation of ADF resources, and
(c) processing status of the projects in the pipeline.
6.
For 2005–06, annual ADF lending level for Tajikistan is planned about
$35–40 million, and TA grant level will be around $1.9 million.

- 56 -

APPENDIX IV

TAJIKISTAN: STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
The country page for Tajikistan was introduced in the International Financial
Statistics (IFS) in February 2003. Methodological soundness is apparent in the areas of
consumer prices, government finance statistics, and monetary statistics. However, an
intensified effort is needed to strengthen the scope, classification/sectorization, and basis of
recording of the national accounts, and to reconsider the concepts and the basis or recording
the input data underlying compilation of the producer price index. Furthermore, there is need
for consistency in applying the residency concept in the balance of payments and the national
accounts statistics. The scope of the foreign trade data needs to be improved to cover the
shuttle trade. Efforts to further improve the quality of economic statistics are limited by tight
budgetary constraints. The authorities have requested significant Fund technical assistance
which is currently being considered for inclusion in STA’s RAP. A data ROSC mission
visited Tajikistan during April 5–19, 2004. A General Data Dissemination System (GDDS)
metadata development mission also visited Dushanbe during October 7–15, 2004.
Tajikistan’s participation in the GDDS took place at the end of November 2004.
National accounts statistics
2.
Although Goskomstat has made serious efforts to improve the national accounts
statistics, the compilation of GDP estimates needs to be strengthened. The national accounts
concepts and definitions are based on the conceptual framework developed by the CIS
Statistics Committee, which agree broadly with the 1993 System of National Accounts,
although there are some deviations from international standards in the scope of production
and assets boundaries. Annual GDP estimates are derived from the production side by
supplementing the net material product data reported by enterprises with estimates for
services. The derived nominal GDP estimates are difficult to reconcile with the sectoral
growth rates, forecasted CPI and terms of trade developments. The accuracy of the GDP
current price estimates is undermined by inadequate coverage of new private sector activities
and by improper valuation. Valuation of reported inventories and consumption of fixed
capital do not agree with international standards. The techniques used for deriving volume
measures of GDP by activity are not sound. Currently, no official volume measures of GDP
by expenditure have been compiled.
3.
Although Goskomstat is aware of the benefits of producing independent quarterly
GDP estimates, these estimates are still compiled on experimental basis as cumulative figures
through extrapolation using indices of sectoral output at a highly aggregated level. The
decumulated quarterly GDP figures show a marked seasonal pattern, with output increasing
strongly at the time of the fall harvest. The current practice of collecting cumulative totals
results in inaccurate quarterly estimates, since the quarterly data are obtained by subtracting
successive cumulative totals, and consequently include a revision component. Other features
of the previous system also persist. In particular, there is a strong demand for detailed data on
individual enterprises, which ties up resources that could otherwise be put to better use.

- 57 -

APPENDIX IV

While reorienting its data collection effort within sampling frameworks, Goskomstat needs to
undertake a strategic reappraisal of its production activities and significantly reduce the
volume of microdata presently collected, while educating users to focus on statistical
aggregates.
Price statistics
4.
Since January 1994, Goskomstat has compiled a CPI on a monthly basis. The index
was compiled with technical assistance from STA. A PPI is also compiled on a monthly
basis. At present, the PPI does not follow international standards (PPI Manual) and suffers
from a number of shortcomings in the scope of the index and the basis for recording.
Furthermore, the index compilation does not properly account for both domestic and export
prices (not used currently) affecting, in particular, the most important product in the basket –
aluminum (over 50 percent). The statistical techniques for compiling both CPI and PPI need
to be improved.
Government finance statistics
5.
Since January 2000, the classification of fiscal accounts follows the IMF’s Manual
on Government Finance Statistics 1986 (GFSM 1986). The new accounts were developed
with FAD technical assistance. There are no plans at present to migrate the basis of
compilation to the new GFS standards based on the Government Finance Statistics
Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001). The 2002 budget follows GFS, and its execution is also
reported with the GFS classification system. However, the weakness inherent in the
accounting system and the poor quality of data limit the benefits from the GFS system.
Statistics on state budget operations are available about two to three weeks after the end of
the reference period.
6.
Statistics are produced for the general government sector. GFS cover all the
economic flows, and the stock of debt, of general government to the standard specified in
GFSM 1986. Sectorization of government is consistent with general government in the 1993
SNA. Revenue, expenditure, lending minus repayments, and financing transactions, are
classified using the methodology set out in GFSM 1986. All flow data are recorded on a
cash basis, valued on the basis of the amount of actual payments and receipts in cash, as
recommended in GFSM 1986. Data covering the consolidated central government as well as
the consolidated local government for 1998–2001 have been reported by Tajikistan for
publication in the 2002 GFS Yearbook, an effort that was disrupted in 2003. Monthly data
on the operations of central government are not reported for inclusion in IFS. In addition,
further work could usefully target, in particular, improving the financing information
(classification and valuation of transactions), consistent with the government debt. Steps
should also be taken to ensure availability of information on the public sector as well as on
quasi-fiscal operations.

- 58 -

APPENDIX IV

Money and banking statistics
7.
The procedures used by NBT for collecting and compiling monetary statistics are in
line with the framework of Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual as recommended by
STA missions. However, due to ongoing revisions to the charts of account for the NBT and
commercial banks, the NBT staff need to routinely review and update the complementary
computer program for compilation of monetary statistics by appropriately incorporating and
classifying all new balance sheet accounts in the monetary survey. Currently, some
nonresident accounts are included in other assets and other liabilities rather than under
foreign assets and foreign liabilities of the monetary survey.
8.
The authorities and the USAID team assisting the NBT in improving banking
supervision have indicated their desire for Fund assistance in revising the chart of accounts
for commercial banks and monetary statistics report forms. The USAID team has identified a
number of weaknesses in the existing chart of accounts for the commercial banks and
proposed revisions to ensure suitability for monetary statistics and banking supervision
purposes.
Balance of payments statistics
9.
The balance of payments statistics have been compiled by the Balance of Payments
Statistics Unit of the NBT since January 1997. The NBT is responsible for establishing the
statistical methodology, reporting forms, data collection, verification, processing,
compilation and dissemination of balance of payments data. Working arrangements among
government agencies that provide statistical data for balance of payments compilation are
consistent with their assignments of responsibility.
10.
The authorities have made significant improvements in compiling the balance of
payments statistics with assistance provided by STA. The ROSC mission found that most
recommendations of previous missions had been implemented and that the NBT has adopted
alternative statistical treatments for workers’ remittances and clarified valuation for
humanitarian aid and petroleum products. However several important pending issues need to
be corrected:—collection is based on two incompatible definitions for residency that hamper
proper coverage and are a source for errors and omissions. In several instances, complete
coverage is hampered by missing information. The NBT should liaise with other producing
agencies, chiefly the Goskomstat, to review and supplement missing information, for
instance to cover completely shuttle trade, transactions of foreign-owned direct investment
enterprises, private debt and to adequately record forward contracts for cotton producing
companies. Also, inadequate coordination between the NBT and the Goskomstat explain
enduring discrepancies in trade series produced by both agencies.
11.
Regarding the institutional environment for the compilation of balance of payments
statistics, the ROSC mission noted that legal provisions are still missing to adequately
protect the confidentiality of individual information. In addition, no documentation is made

- 59 -

available to balance of payments statistics users, and no advance notice is given to users for
major changes in the methodology, data sources, and statistical techniques. However, since
May 2003, the main coordination body became a legal entity (Interagency Commission for
Coordinating Balance of Payments Preparation and Compilation) and is entitled to adopt
executive decisions to carry out on all relevant tasks in balance of payments statistics, but
has no representation for private users of statistics.

REPUBLIC OF TAJIKISTAN
Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies
for the Period October 1, 2004 to September 30, 2005
Under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Tajikistan has been pursuing an economic and financial reform program with support
from the International Monetary Fund’s Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF)
during the past two years, with very positive effects on the economy. This Memorandum of
Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) reviews recent progress and details our economic
strategy for the third annual program under this facility.
II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND PERFORMANCE UNDER THE PROGRAM
2.
Real GDP expanded by 10 percent in 2004 supporting a rapid increase in real
wages, household incomes, and consumption. This growth was fueled by economic activity
in manufacturing and services, especially in trade. Inflation has slowed to 5.6 percent at end2004, below the program target and well down from 13 percent at end-2003. The nominal
exchange rate remained stable over the past year, contributing to the reduction in inflationary
pressures.
3.
External conditions, which were very favorable at the beginning of 2004,
deteriorated through this year, especially with rising oil prices and falling cotton prices. As a
result, we expect the trade deficit to widen slightly in 2004, to 15 percent of GDP.
Significant growth in remittances, including from migrants, offset the decline in external aid
and will limit the deterioration in the current account to about 2½ percentage point, resulting
in a deficit of 3.9 percent of GDP in 2004. Gross international reserves at end-2004 rose to
two months of imports. Recently concluded debt reduction agreements with Pakistan and
Russia will substantially reduce the debt service burden over the medium term.
4.
Macroeconomic policies have remained on track. The projected budget deficit
(excluding the foreign-financed public investment program, PIP) for 2004 at the start of the
second-year program was 0.4 percent of GDP; however, we now expect to realize an overall
budget surplus of 0.3 percent of GDP. Higher-than-projected GDP growth boosted nominal
tax collections to SM 934 million, above the revised program target of SM 880 million,
resulting in tax revenue of 15.2 percent of GDP, slightly above the 2003 level. Social
expenditures increased by 0.5 percent of GDP, to 7.1 percent of GDP.
5.
The implementation of monetary policy improved in 2004, assisted by the tight
fiscal policy, and the National Bank of Tajikistan (NBT) observed all of the monetary policy

- 64 -

ATTACHMENT II

targets. Both the ceiling on net domestic assets of the NBT and net credit of the banking
system to government for end-March and end-September 2004 were observed, the floor on
net international reserves was exceeded by a wide margin (all performance criteria), and the
indicative target for reserve money was met. Net international reserves were $70 million at
end-September 2004, compared with an adjusted target of $66 million, despite curtailing of
foreign exchange purchases from large exporters. Preliminary indications suggest that all
indicative targets for end-December 2004 were also met, except for some arrears of SOEs to
utility companies (Annex III, Table 1).
6.
We have completed almost all the structural benchmarks for the second annual
program, although with some delays. As a result of the education reform strategy, we have
reduced the number of funded positions by 15 percent in September, well in excess of the
July 2004 benchmark. Tighter enforcement of prudential regulations has improved the
financial position of all banks. As of October 1, only three of the 12 banks and branches of
foreign banks failed to meet all key prudential requirements. The capital deficiency of the
government-owned Amonat Bank will need to be increased but no agreement has yet been
reached with the NBT to make up this deficiency because the future strategy for the bank is
still being discussed. Agreements have been signed with the remaining two banks on
measures to bring them into compliance before end-December 2005. After delays, partly due
to lack of funding, the audit of Tajikgas was completed in February 2005.The process of
completing an inventory of external debts contracted or guaranteed by the government and
NBT and identifying their status has been completed. Notwithstanding the improvement in
recording of debts in dispute, the comprehensive recording of all such claims incurred during
the period of civil strife in the early 1990s has proven to be very difficult.
7.
We have continued to implement energy sector reforms under the program. We
have installed over 60,000 gas meters since October 2003 and increased collection rates in
this sector. The energy compensation mechanism has been reviewed to improve the targeting
of poor households and the application procedure streamlined.
III. ECONOMIC POLICIES FOR THE THIRD ANNUAL PROGRAM
8.
During the third year of the program, we will build on the recent progress and
intensify structural reforms. In particular, we plan to achieve the following main objectives:
•
Achieve real GDP growth of 8 percent and limit inflation to no more than 6 percent in
2005. The lower economic growth in 2005 is forecast due to the somewhat weaker external
environment.
•
Maintain the gross international reserve cover at 2.3 months of imports through
end-2005.

- 65 -

ATTACHMENT II

•
Limit the fiscal deficit in 2005 to SM 35 million (0.5 percent of GDP), continue to
focus budget expenditure on social areas, and implement public sector reforms in the core
civil service, education, and health care sectors.
•

Improve the implementation of monetary policy.

•
Continue to implement structural reforms in the energy, banking, and agricultural
sectors.
•

Improve the environment for private sector development.
A. Fiscal Policy

9.
The budget for 2005 envisages an overall fiscal deficit (excluding the
foreign-financed PIP) of ½ percent of GDP. In support of this goal, we will implement tax
and customs administration measures to raise tax revenue collections to SM 1,115 million or
15.7 percent of GDP, and continue to strengthen expenditure management through improved
prioritization of expenditures. Recognizing the low level of government wages and the recent
decline in the wage bill in relation to GDP, we will increase the wage bill to 3.9 percent of
GDP. Wage increases in the civil service will be differentiated by rank. The high rates of
increase seek to address the problems of very low and unattractive wages, especially in the
health sector. The wage increase will be given in two tranches, in parallel with government
administration reforms, and will be financed by savings on interest from recent debt
agreements, increased tax revenues, and economies in nonessential current expenditures.
10.
In 2005, disbursements under the PIP will be limited to 4 percent of GDP to help
protect debt sustainability. Also, we will continue to strengthen prioritization of the PIP to
take into account our investment priorities as outlined in the PRSP, absorptive capacity, and
the availability of domestic counterpart resources.
11.
The 2005 budget is consistent with the medium-term fiscal framework that aims
at strengthening macroeconomic stability while providing more resources for the social
sectors. In particular, under this framework the budget deficit (excluding the PIP) is set at
0.5 percent of GDP for the period 2006–07. We will continue to exercise tight control over
the size of the budget deficit and will keep it under review, particularly taking into account
the availability of concessional external financing compared to the current projections. We
will also aim to raise revenue in relation to GDP. Recognizing the uncertainties about
commodity prices and the yield from tax reform measures, we are conservatively targeting
tax revenue to GDP to increase gradually to slightly over 16 percent of GDP by 2007. This
would allow for increases in wage expenditure in priority sectors. The large increase in the
wage bill to 3.9 percent of GDP in 2005 is a one-off catch-up to prevent a further
deterioration in public services and foster reforms. The increase will be offset in part by
across the board cuts in nonwage expenditure, which grew rapidly in 2004. We expect

- 66 -

ATTACHMENT II

further increases in the wage bill in terms of GDP from the projected level for 2005 to be
limited and consistent with available revenue, further expenditure savings, and public
administration reforms, in particular in education and health.
12.
The implementation of the revised tax and customs codes on January 1, 2005 will
allow us to improve our revenue mobilization. The revised codes simplify the tax and
customs rules and reduce the number of nuisance taxes (i.e., fees, charges, and duties) to
enhance compliance, and introduce two new taxes—the unified agricultural tax and the
minimum tax on business. The new tax and customs codes will be placed on the MSRD’s
website, together with information on tax and customs payers’ rights and responsibilities. To
strengthen tax administration, by June 30, 2005 we will expand the register of the Large
Taxpayer Inspectorate (LTI) to cover at least 60 percent of total tax collections (structural
benchmark). To establish an appropriate tax/governance environment for new large
energy-related projects, we will vigorously pursue full tax payments from this sector. From
the start of 2005, Tajik Aluminum Plant (TadAZ) and Barki Tajik will remain current on
their tax payments (in the latter case allowing for technical losses), and Barki Tajik will put
in place a mechanism by March 2005 to immediately transfer to the Treasury the tax share of
TadAZ’s payments (structural benchmark).
13.
Recognizing the need to adapt institutions to the market economy and eliminate
duplication and redundancy, we are embarking on a multiyear program to reform government
administration. In parallel with the first tranche of the wage increase at the start of 2005, on
February 4, 2005 we adopted a reform strategy that outlines the approach to government
reform that will both address governmental structures and personnel information and
management systems (prior action). This will include a start of reforms in the economic and
the social blocs with the assistance of the World Bank and other agencies, including upfront
actions to streamline functions and reduce positions by 3 percent. This strategy is
summarized in Annex I. This plan includes finalizing the health financing reform strategy,
which we expect to adopt in the first quarter 2005.
14.
The second tranche of the wage increase (SM 16 million) would be released after
June 2005, conditional on completing additional reforms, availability of revenue, and
moderate inflation. For the civil service, this will entail the implementation of measures
under the ministry-specific reform plans in the Presidential Order plus the submission of
amendments to the Civil Service Law to parliament by July 2005 to rationalize the pay
system, and to exclude the political appointments (ministers and above) from the civil
service. In the education sector, allocation of the second tranche will be conditional on
further progress in implementing Government Resolution 291 on the reform of general
education in 2004–09, and extending these reforms to higher education. In health, allocation
of the second tranche would be conditional on extending the treatment-based funding and the
guaranteed benefits package that focuses on primary health care to three rayons, including
Dushanbe, and reducing positions in health by a further 2 percent.

- 67 -

ATTACHMENT II

15.
The expenditure and cash management functions of the treasury will be
strengthened. Specifically, we will establish and make operational a cash management unit
and improve administrative procedures and communication between headquarters and local
branches of the central treasury to facilitate budget reporting and cash management by
September 2005 (structural benchmark). Budget institutions will remain current on all utility
payments and any settlements of 2004 arrears and tax liabilities will be made through the
budget. In addition, to improve the quality and currentness of budget information, a new
budget classification system with a more detailed functional classification will be introduced
by March 2005. We will also increase the transparency of the central state investment plan
(CSIP).
B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
16.
The monetary program for 2005 focuses on improving the implementation of
monetary policy and further reducing inflationary pressures. The program envisages an
increase of 10 percent in reserve money mainly through the buildup of foreign reserves. An
increase in the money multiplier associated with a reduction in the required reserve ratio is
expected, with broad money growing by about 18 percent. This faster growth in broad money
than in nominal GDP reflects the continued improvement in confidence in the banking
system. Banking sector credit to the noncotton sector is expected to increase by 25 percent,
while bank credit to the cotton sector is expected to remain flat following very strong growth
in 2004, as some cotton sector debts are repaid in early 2005. Also, Kredit Invest will
continue to resolve its outstanding cotton claims and debts to foreign lenders and discontinue
intermediating foreign loans to the cotton sector. While the authorities expect the public
sector wage increase to have a limited impact on prices, the NBT stands ready to tighten
monetary policy if there is a significant inflationary effect.
17.
In support of the 2005 monetary program, and to strengthen long-term monetary
policy management, the authorities plan to expand the range of monetary policy instruments.
To achieve this, the MOF will finance its projected deficit in 2005 partly by issuing and
auctioning SM 3 million of short-term treasury securities, starting in the second quarter 2005.
To strengthen the capital base of the NBT, the NBT, and MOF will review and revise the
mechanism for settling interest on government securities and government deposits by March
2005, and will apply this new mechanism to settlements starting with first quarter 2005.
Also, the NBT will not make expenditure that are not related to its core business activities
nor pay dividends on profits to the ministry of finance while is has negative net worth
(continuous structural performance criterion) and will not issue directed credits (continuous
structural performance criterion). More generally, the only situation in which the NBT will
provide credit is as lender of last resort to banks, and at punitive interest rates. The NBT will
consult with Fund staff whenever circumstances requiring the granting of such credits arise.
The NBT will actively pursue the repayment of its loan portfolio by aggressively pursuing its
debtors and disposing of its holding of collateral seized in lieu of bad debts. Specifically, the

- 68 -

ATTACHMENT II

NBT plans to reduce its claims on banks and the corporate sector by SM 10 million between
October 2004 and June 2005 (structural benchmark).
18.
The NBT will continue to maintain a managed floating exchange rate regime.
Interventions in the foreign exchange market will be aimed at meeting the international
reserves targets and smoothing excessive exchange rate volatility, in line with the
recommendations of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC).
C. External Policies and Debt Management
19.
The NBT and government will continue to prohibit all external nonconcessional
borrowing contracted or guaranteed by the government or the NBT, and no drawings will be
made on any outstanding nonconcessional credit facilities. In the area of external debt
management, decisive steps will be taken to complete the inventory of public sector external
debt (including SOEs even if not guaranteed by the government), by end-March 2005. The
MOF will intensify efforts to start using the Debt Tracking System for debt management and
forecasting, and enhance the training of staff responsible for maintaining the debt inventory.
20.
The NBT will extend the monitoring of external debt to private sector debt.
Starting with the cotton sector, by end-June 2005, the NBT will develop a database of all
private sector external debt (structural benchmark). This database inventory will be
continuously updated and monitored, and we will take measures to encourage private firms
to service their debts.
21.
We are committed to maintaining a liberal trade and investment environment and
will ensure that the harmonization of our trade regime with that of the Eurasian Economic
Community is consistent with this goal. We are also working toward joining the World Trade
Organization (WTO). A working party of the WTO will hold its second meeting in
February 2005 to discuss our accession.
22.
We have completed the legislative changes to liberalize current account
transactions and accepted with effect from December 9, 2004 the obligations under
Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement.
D. Other Structural Policies
23.
We are continuing our efforts to strengthen the banking sector by strictly
enforcing all prudential requirements. We will tighten loan classification rules and continue
to revoke banking licenses of the weakest banks and strictly enforce all prudential
requirements by imposing the maximum penalty for noncompliance. We have raised the
minimum capital requirement to $5 million on January 1, 2005 for the largest four banks
(except Amonat Bank) and from January 1, 2006 for all other banks. We will gradually
(quarterly) raise the minimum capital requirement for credit associations from $150,000 on

- 69 -

ATTACHMENT II

January 1, 2005 to $300,000 on January 1, 2006. We will ensure that Kredit-Invest is subject
to the same prudential requirements as other nonbank financial institutions, including in the
area of provisioning for nonperforming loans, and that it is subject to annual audits by a
reputable auditor. We will also consider setting up a credit bureau to facilitate higher quality
lending.
24.
In view of the prospects for major capital flows into Tajikistan, the authorities are
committed to better integrate the banking system with international markets. Such integration
can be best facilitated by opening the banking system to highly reputable foreign banks and
will require the liberalization of some of the banking sector regulations. In particular, by
end-June 2005, the regulatory limits on foreign capital in the banking system will be
eliminated, as well as the requirement that a Tajik citizen should head a commercial bank
(structural benchmark).
25.
Other structural policies will continue to include the energy and agriculture
sectors. In the energy sector, the authorities will strive to increase collection rates for gas and
electricity through more aggressive collections from major energy debtors, installing gas and
electricity meters, and stronger enforcement of collections from households. Automatic
quarterly adjustments of all utility tariffs will be continued to account for depreciation of the
nominal exchange rate (structural performance criteria), but in view of the low bill collection
rate, tariffs will not be reduced if the somoni appreciates against the dollar. In addition to
imposing tighter constraints on Barki Tajik, steps will be taken to ensure that TadAZ remains
current on its 2005 electricity bills and taxes, and that budget entities also remain current on
their utility payments.
26.
In the agricultural sector, the government is finalizing its cotton debt resolution
strategy in consultation with donors and will implement it promptly. We estimate the total
cotton sector debt at SM 647 million ($214 million), of which SM 470 million is owed to
foreign creditors. This will be resolved on a case-by-case basis and without government
guarantees with the participation of an impartial expert committee. In addition, we will
strengthen the sector by stopping interference by local authorities in farm production
decisions, eliminating cotton production plans at below the national level, and accelerating
land privatization.
27.
The government recognizes the importance of significantly improving the
business environment for private sector development. To this end we will make the ministry
of economy and trade responsible for private sector development and will review business
regulations in collaboration with the IFC. To improve the provision of services, in addition to
opening up the banking sector, we will continue to restructure Tajik Air, with the assistance
of donors, and ensure that reputable international airlines are given access to the major routes
to Tajikistan.

- 70 -

ATTACHMENT II

E. Program Monitoring
28.
The third annual program covers the period October 1, 2004–September 30, 2005,
and will be monitored through two reviews by the Fund’s Executive Board based on
semi-annual performance criteria for end-March 2005 and end-September 2005, indicative
targets, and structural performance criteria and benchmarks. We request that the fifth review
of the program take place on or after June 1, 2005, based on performance as of March 31,
2005, and that the sixth review take place on or after December 1, 2005, based on
performance as of September 30, 2005.
29.
Quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets are specified in Annex III.
The quantitative performance criteria are: a floor on net international reserves of the NBT; a
ceiling on net domestic assets of the NBT; a ceiling on net banking system credit to
government; a ceiling on the cumulative fiscal deficit of the general government; a floor on
cumulative tax collections; zero ceilings on the accumulation of wage and nonworking
pension arrears and external arrears; and zero ceilings on the net disbursement of mediumand long-term nonconcessional external debt contracted or guaranteed by the government or
NBT. Detailed definitions and reporting requirements for these performance criteria are
contained in the Technical Memorandum of Understanding attached to this memorandum
(Annex V). The structural performance criteria and benchmarks are detailed in Annex IV.

ATTACHMENT II
ANNEX I

Summary of Presidential Order on the Plan of Action for
Reforming the System of Government Management
(Starting stage)
This annex is a summary of the Presidential Order signed on February 4, 2005. The specific
actions envisaged in this strategy cover:
o the bloc of economics-related agencies, including parts of the President’s office
and ministries (ministries of finance, economy and trade, and state revenues
and duties);
o the bloc of social sector-related agencies; and
o civil service management.
Reform strategy and specific actions
An underlying principle of the strategy would be that ministries/agencies focus on other core
activities. As part of the reform effort, the number of funded civil service positions will be
reduced by at least 3 percent, and technical personnel by 5 percent.
Reform of economic sectors
President’s office: Organize the economic functions of the office to focus on general
economic policy development and implementation oversight.
o in doing so, rationalize functions to appropriate ministries.
The ministry of finance: Approve a plan to reform the ministry of finance by June 2005. The
underlying principle of this plan will be the ministry’s reorganization on a functional basis.
Specifically, the plan will include the following measures:
o operationalize in the central treasury a division to manage cash transactions by
September 2005;
o enhance the ministry’s interaction with other ministries/agencies to better prioritize
expenditure and formalize its settlements with National Bank; and
o strengthen the analytical capacity of the ministry.
The ministry of the economy and trade: Approve a plan to reform the ministry by June 2005.
Specifically the plan will include the following measures:
o limit the ministry’s role in compiling indicative plans only at the national level and
reinforce its role in strategic forecasting (to identify no more than key short- and
long-term macroeconomic aggregates);

- 72 -

ATTACHMENT II
ANNEX I

o strengthen the ministry’s role in promoting more favorable conditions for private
sector development and the investment climate, and transfer this function from the
Anti-Monopoly Policy Agency to the ministry; and
o integrate the Plan for Social and Economic Development with the PRSP.
Ministry of state revenue and duties: A modernization plan reorganizing the ministry along
functional lines was prepared recently and is presently being implemented. In line with this
plan, the following specific measures will be implemented:
o prepare and adopt a plan to computerize registration of taxpayers (March 2005); and
o extend the current pilot project to streamline taxpayer registration, and receipt and
review of tax declarations to Dushanbe, Khujand, Kurgantube, and to the Large
Taxpayers Inspectorate by end-2005.
Reform of the social sectors
The reform of the social sector will be accelerated.
The ministry of labor and social protection: The ministry will be reformed as a pilot project
in ministerial restructuring. A review is to be completed shortly and will, by the end of 2004
provide the basis for a plan for reforming the ministry by late March 2005. The reform will
integrate the three component structures merged earlier to rationalize their policies, services,
and other functions, as well streamline its relations with Social Protection Fund and Amonat
Bank.
Education: Continue implementing Government Resolution 291 of June 2004 to
comprehensively reform general education in 2004–09. This will be extended in mid-2005 to
higher education under a comparable strategy.
Health care: Restructure the health care system in line with the strategy for the reform
healthcare financing to be finalized by the end of the first quarter 2005. This plan will
include a guaranteed benefits package, changing the funding system to a treatment basis,
shifting resources to primary healthcare, and introducing co-payments and paid services.
Improvements in civil service
Specific measures in this area cover recruitment, rationalization of salaries, and establishing
a register of civil service positions.
o Civil service recruitment: Recruitment will be through open competition following
the Presidential Decree of August 2004. The new recruitment procedure will be
reviewed in early 2005 and changed accordingly.

- 73 -

ATTACHMENT II
ANNEX I

o Rationalization of salaries: Amend the Law on the Civil Service to set up a new
salary system, which will include base salary, seniority factor, and rank coefficient.
Include salary increments (e.g., for medical services, vacations, etc.) in the base
salary. Implement the new pay system as of January 2006.
o Submit the revised Law on the Civil Service to Parliament by July 2005 and start its
implementation from 2006. The revised law should separate political appointments
(from the rank of minister and up) from professional staff.
o Civil service register: Complete the register of civil service positions by end 2004.
Complete the register of civil service staff by end April 2005. This will help to
eliminate vacant positions.

Definitions
11.
The external debt limits (short-, medium- and long-term) apply to the government of
Tajikistan, the National Bank of Tajikistan and any other agency acting on behalf of the
government. For short, medium- and long-term external debt, the performance criterion
applies not only to debt as defined in point No. 9 of the Guidelines on Performance Criteria
with Respect to Foreign Debt (Decision No. 12274-(00/85), adopted August 24, 2000), but
also to commitments contracted or guaranteed and for which value has not been received.
12.
The definition of debt set forth in point No. 9 of the guidelines reads as follows:
“(a) For the purposes of this guideline, the term “debt” will be understood to mean a current,
i.e., not contingent, liability, created under a contractual arrangement through the provision
of value in the form of assets (including currency) or services, and which requires the obligor
to make one or more payments in the form of assets (including currency) or services, at some

83

ATTACHMENT II
ANNEX V

future points in time; these payments will discharge the principal and/or interest liabilities
under the contract. Debts can take a number of forms, the primary ones being as follows:
(i) loans, i.e., advances of money to obligor by the lender made on the basis of an
undertaking that the obligor will repay the funds in the future (including deposits, bonds,
debentures, commercial loans, and buyers’ credits) and temporary exchanges of assets that
are equivalent to fully collateralized loans under which the obligor is required to repay the
funds and usually pay interest, by repurchasing the collateral from the buyer in the future
(such as repurchase agreements and official swap arrangements); (ii) suppliers’ credits, i.e.,
contracts where the supplier permits the obligor to defer payments until some time after the
date on which the goods are delivered or services are provided; and (iii) leases, i.e.,
arrangements under which property is provided which the lessee has the right to use one or
more specified period(s) of time that are usually shorter than the total expected service life of
the property, while the lessor retains the title to the property. For the purpose of the
guideline, the debt is the present value (at the inception of the lease) of all lease payments
expected to be made during the period of the agreement excluding those payments that cover
the operation, repair or maintenance of the property. (b) Under the definition of debt set out
in point 9(a) above, arrears, penalties, and judicially awarded damages arising from the
failure to make payment under a contractual obligation that constitutes debt are debt. Failure
to make payment on an obligation that is not considered debt under this definition (e.g.,
payment on delivery) will not give rise to debt.”
13.
External debt limits apply to the contracting or guaranteeing of new nonconcessional
short term external debt (with an original maturity of up to and including one year), and to
the contracting or guaranteeing of new nonconcessional medium- and long-term external
debt (with original maturities of more than one year).
14.
Excluded from the external debt limits are loans contracted for the purpose of debt
rescheduling or refinancing if the terms of the new loan are more favorable. IMF credit is
excluded from the external debt limits. The performance criterion on new nonconcessional
short-term external debt will not apply to loans classified as international reserve liabilities of
the NBT (liabilities of the NBT to nonresidents with an original maturity of up to and
including one year). Normal import-related financing is excluded from the performance
criterion on new short-term external debt.
15.
Debt falling within the external debt limits that are denominated in currencies other
than the U.S. dollar shall be valued in U.S. dollars at the exchange rate prevailing at the time
the contracting or guaranteeing takes place or at the exchange rate stipulated in the contract.
16.
For the purposes of the program, the guarantee of a debt arises from any explicit legal
obligation of the government or the NBT or any other agency acting on behalf of the
government to service such a debt in the event of nonpayment by the debtor (involving
payments in cash or in kind), or indirectly through any other obligation of the government or
the NBT or any other agency acting on behalf of the government to finance a shortfall
incurred by the debtors.

84

ATTACHMENT II
ANNEX V

17.
A concessional debt is defined as one with a grant element equivalent to 35 percent or
more. The grant element is calculated using the commercial interest reference rates (CIRRs)
plus a margin, which will be taken as those for January 1, 2005 until this is revised in the
program. For debts of an original maturity of 15 years or more, the average CIRR over the
last 10 years will be used, while the average of CIRRs of the preceding six-month period will
be used to assess the concessionality of debts with original maturities of less than 15 years.
To the ten-year and six month averages of CIRRs, the following margins will be added:
0.75 percent for repayment periods of less than 15 years; 1 percent for 15–19 years;
1.15 percent for 20–29 years; and 1.25 percent for 30 and more years.
II. CONTINUOUS QUANTITATIVE TARGETS
A. No Directed Credits by the NBT
18.
The NBT will not issue any directed credits. These involve credits that are issued in
the absence of a competitive auction or on nonmarket terms and conditions. This requirement
will be monitored on the basis of changes in the NBT’s balance sheets supported by the
NBT’s regular reporting on credit related activities.
B. No Noncore Activities of the NBT and no Dividend Payments by the NBT
19.
The NBT will neither make any expenditures not related to its core business activities
nor pay dividends while it has negative net worth.
C. No New External Payments Arrears
20.
No new external payments arrears shall be accumulated at any time under the PRGF
arrangement, excluding those which are subject to negotiation among creditors. External
payments arrears are defined as overdue debt service arising in respect of obligations
incurred directly, guaranteed, or converted into interstate debt by the government of
Tajikistan or the NBT, including penalties or interest charges.
D. Ceiling on General Government Wage and Nonworking
Pensioners Pension Arrears
21.
For purposes of the performance criterion, arrears on general government and
nonworking pensioner’ pension shall be monitored as any shortfall in monthly disbursements
of wages and pensions. The monthly disbursement plan will be a third of each quarter’s
budgeted wage and pension payments as in the general government budget and budget of the
Social Protection Fund. These payments are defined as overdue if they have come due at the
end of the month and remain unpaid thereafter for 30 days or more. The program ceilings on
the stock of wage and pension arrears are presented in Table 7 below:

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
March 18, 2005

The following information has become available since the staff report was issued on March 3,
2005. This information does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
•

In the February 27 elections for the lower house of parliament, the ruling People's
Democratic Party of Tajikistan won 80 percent of the votes. Opposition parties signed a
petition complaining about irregularities during the electoral process. Elections for the
upper house are scheduled for March 24, 2005.

•

Consumer price inflation (on a 12-month basis) rose slightly to 6 percent in February 2005
owing to weather-related food price increases.

•

Preliminary data indicate that policy implementation has been consistent with the program.
In particular, the fiscal surplus was larger than projected in January-February 2005. The
recent resumption of cotton exports in response to a moderate increase in international
cotton prices is contributing to higher budget revenue, as well as to a reduction in the
indebtedness of the cotton sector.

•

The somoni has remained broadly stable against the U.S. dollar since end-2004.

•

On the structural side, on March 4 the authorities approved the Strategy for the Resolution
of Cotton Farm Debt in order to address this long-standing problem that has constrained
development in the farm sector. The strategy contains both cotton sector reform and debt
resolution measures, including the resolution of the farm debt on a case-by-case basis
using an independent commission and without government guarantees.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation
with the Republic of Tajikistan
On March 18, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with the Republic of Tajikistan.1
Background
Tajikistan’s transition to a market economy has been protracted, but reform efforts are paying
off. Domestic political stability, deepening economic liberalization, a strong regional economy,
and favorable terms of trade contributed to real GDP growth averaging 10 percent per year in
2000–04. Economic activity continued to diversify rapidly into the services sector. Real
household incomes are on the rise, especially from remittances, and there is evidence of
declining poverty. The private sector has grown and the banking system has been liberalized
and strengthened. Rapidly growing migrants’ remittances and small scale exports have become
a major source of household supplemental income.
Strengthened fiscal discipline and tighter monetary policy have reduced inflation from
40 percent in 2001 to 5.6 percent in 2004. Strong growth in tax revenues and continued
expenditure restraint contributed to small fiscal surpluses in the past two years.
The implementation of monetary policy improved significantly in the past two years. Since late
2003, the National Bank of Tajikistan (NBT) has successfully focused on stabilizing reserve
money growth that has contributed to the significant reduction in inflation. The exchange rate of

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2the national currency, the somoni, remained remarkably stable in the past two years.
The authorities have taken determined measures to significantly improve the external debt
profile. The debt-for-asset swap with the Russian Federation, and debt relief received from
Pakistan reduced Tajikistan’s stock of external debt to 40 percent of GDP at end-2004.
Under the relatively favorable external and domestic environment, the authorities completed the
legislative changes to eliminate the few exchange restrictions on current transactions and
accepted the obligations of the Article VIII, Sections 2, 3 and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of
Agreement on December 9, 2004. Through improved banking supervision and enforcement of
prudential regulations, the authorities made further progress in strengthening the banking sector
and the sector’s capital rose sharply in 2004.
Nonetheless, progress in a number of priority reform areas envisaged in the PRSP
(http://www.imf.org/external/np/prsp/2002/tjk/01/ ) has been slow. In particular, the business
environment and public and private sector transparency and governance need to be
strengthened further. In the energy sector, while gas prices have been adjusted, electricity
tariffs are still well below long-run cost recovery levels. In the agricultural sector, the lack of
underlying reform and the distortion of market signals and debt overhang in the cotton sector
are holding back growth and rural poverty reduction. Although the initial measures in education
and health reforms have been implemented, the remaining agenda for public administration
reform is substantial.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors commended the authorities for the considerable progress made in 2004 in
strengthening Tajikistan’s economic performance. Sound macroeconomic policies and political
stability have contributed to strong economic growth, a marked decline in inflation, and a
reduction in poverty. Directors noted, however, that sustaining rapid growth required a stronger
commitment to structural reform.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ prudent fiscal program for 2005. They emphasized the
importance of implementing effectively the new tax and customs codes, and strengthening
revenue administration, including through the expansion of the Large Taxpayer Inspectorate
and enforcing the collection of tax and utility payments by state-owned enterprises in the energy
and aluminum sectors, in order to boost revenue and strengthen governance.
Directors noted the significant increase in the wage bill envisaged in the 2005 budget, which is
aimed at retaining appropriately qualified personnel and stemming the deterioration in the
provision of public services. While recognizing the need for flexibility in the composition of
expenditure, they urged the authorities to monitor expenditure carefully and move expeditiously
with public sector administration reform in order to improve efficiency, particularly in the health
and education sectors.
Directors welcomed the continued improvements in monetary management. By adhering to the
monetary and credit targets, the NBT has gained credibility, which has contributed to the
significant reduction in inflation. Looking ahead, the authorities were encouraged to remain

-3vigilant in assuring the achievement of inflation objectives and to move forward with steps to
broaden the range of monetary instruments. Directors considered that the current managed
float exchange rate regime, with intervention in the foreign exchange market limited to
smoothing short-term exchange rate volatility, was appropriate. They also welcomed the
authorities’ recent acceptance of the obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4.
Directors, taking note of the favorable medium-term macroeconomic outlook, pointed to the
critical role played by workers’ remittances in sustaining growth and smoothing the social impact
of the transition to a market economy. Given the associated vulnerabilities, the authorities were
encouraged to strengthen financial intermediation, regularize labor migration issues with
neighboring countries, and resolve regional trade and transit impediments.
Directors commended the authorities for their success in reducing external debt obligations to
manageable levels through effective negotiations and prudent new borrowing. They encouraged
the authorities to further improve external debt management, and to start work on recording and
monitoring private sector external debt, including that incurred by the cotton sector.
They supported the authorities’ continued debt restructuring discussions with bilateral creditors.
Directors welcomed recent steps to strengthen the banking system. They noted, however, that
the level of financial intermediation is still low, and that a sound expansion of the system will be
crucial to support private sector development. In this regard, Directors welcomed the authorities’
intention to remove impediments to the entry of reputable foreign banks into Tajikistan, which is
expected to contribute to enhancing banking services. The increase in minimum capital
requirements for banks was regarded as a positive step to encourage further consolidation of
the financial system. They commended the authorities on steps taken to implement Anti-Money
Laundering/Combating Financing of Terrorism legislation, and encouraged them to continue
their efforts.
Directors urged the authorities to accelerate structural reforms in order to stimulate private
sector development and sustain strong growth. Reforms in agriculture should focus on
eliminating local government interference in farm operations and improving access to financial
services. Directors also underscored the importance of moving ahead with a market-based
resolution of the cotton sector’s nonperforming debt, without recourse to government
guarantees. They also emphasized the need to address weaknesses in the business and
governance environment, including by removing obstacles to private sector activity and
promoting greater competition in key sectors, such as air transport, banking, and
telecommunications.
Directors indicated that further measures were necessary to improve the financial viability of the
energy sector. In particular, they stressed the need to improve collection rates, especially from
large users, and to extend metering. Looking beyond the near term, Directors underscored the
importance of raising electricity tariffs to cost recovery levels while implementing measures to
reduce the impact on the poor, including through lifeline tariffs and improvements in the cash
compensation mechanism.

-4Directors welcomed the progress made in improving the quality and transparency of economic
data, and encouraged continued efforts in this area. In particular, they underscored the
importance of addressing remaining statistical weaknesses in national accounts, fiscal, and
balance of payments data.

IMF Executive Board Completes Fourth Review Under the Republic of Tajikistan's ThreeYear PRGF Arrangement and Approves US$15.1 million Disbursement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has completed the fourth review
of the Republic of Tajikistan's performance under its economic reform program supported by a
three-year Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement. Completion of the
review enables the Republic of Tajikistan to draw an amount equivalent to SDR 9.8 million
(about US$15.1 million) under the arrangement.
The IMF's Executive Board approved the three-year arrangement on December 11, 2002
(see Press Release No. 02/54) for an amount equivalent to SDR 65 million (about
US$99.9 million). Drawing the amount made available by completion of this fourth review will
bring total disbursements under the arrangement to SDR 45.4 million (about US$69.8 million).
Following the discussion of the Executive Board on Friday March 18, 2005, Mr. Agustín
Carstens, Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair, stated:
“Tajikistan’s performance under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF)
arrangement has continued to be satisfactory. Real GDP growth has remained robust and
inflation has fallen significantly as a result of improved program implementation and a favorable
economic environment. In addition, indicators suggest that there has been a further reduction in
poverty levels.
“Assisted by a fiscal surplus, the central bank strengthened monetary management in 2004,
which contributed to the marked reduction in inflation. In 2005, the central bank will seek to
broaden the range of its monetary instruments to further enhance control over base money. The
managed float exchange rate system currently in place will be maintained.
“The budget for 2005 is consistent with a prudent fiscal stance. On the revenue side,
implementation of the new tax and customs codes and stronger compliance by the state-owned
enterprises in the aluminum and energy sectors with tax and utility payments are expected to
boost revenue. Regarding expenditure, the fiscal program envisages a significant increase in the
wage bill aimed at retaining qualified personnel and stemming the deterioration in the provision
of public services. This will be accompanied by reforms in public administration and education
and health care to improve the efficiency of expenditure.

“The recent debt agreements significantly reduced Tajikistan’s medium-term external debt
burden and allow for increased flexibility in the public investment program. Looking ahead, new
borrowing will be closely monitored and properly prioritized.
“The central bank has made progress in strengthening the implementation of bank supervision
regulations. The measures envisaged in the program for 2005 to enhance competition in the
banking sector, including from foreign banks, are expected to have a positive impact on financial
intermediation and the provision of financial services,” Mr. Carstens stated.
The PRGF is the IMF's concessional facility for low-income countries. PRGF-supported
programs are based on country-owned poverty reduction strategies adopted in a participatory
process involving civil society and development partners and articulated in a Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (PRSP). This is intended to ensure that PRGF-supported programs are consistent
with a comprehensive framework for macroeconomic, structural, and social policies to foster
growth and reduce poverty. PRGF loans carry an annual interest rate of 0.5 percent and are
repayable over 10 years with a 5½-year grace period on principal payments.

Statement by Fritz Zurbrügg, Executive Director for Republic of Tajikistan
and Djamoliddin Nuraliev, Advisor to Executive Director
March 18, 2005

1.
As we have stressed in the past, our Tajik authorities attribute great importance to the
longstanding and fruitful relationship with the Fund. Management’s continued support of
Tajikistan’s efforts to overcome the wide range of obstacles faced by a “triple-locked”, lowincome, transition country and staff’s constructive policy advice were crucial in achieving
the strong economic performance described in the papers before us today. The
macroeconomic results over the last five years summarized on page 7 are very encouraging.
Strong growth and low inflation are key ingredients for reducing poverty. Our authorities are
convinced that the results of the economic reform program to date provide an excellent basis
for persisting in their efforts to implement the still remaining difficult structural reforms.
Macroeconomic Policies
2.
Economic activity remained strong and broad-based in 2004. External demand for
Tajik exports remained vigorous, with the value of exports rising by 19 percent. Our
authorities are also very satisfied that the remaining exchange restrictions on current
transactions were eliminated, allowing Tajikistan to accept obligations under Article VIII,
Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement last December. Domestic demand
continued to benefit from growing worker remittances. As noted in the Selected Issues paper,
remittances play a key role for the economic development of Tajikistan. The authorities are
very aware of the macroeconomic relevance of these financial flows and have made strong
efforts to regularize labor migration issues with neighboring countries. The signing of an
agreement last October with Russia, the main destination of Tajik labor migration, was an
important step.
3.
Our authorities are also very satisfied with the results of their efforts to improve the
external debt profile. The precarious external debt situation was long recognized as a major
source of vulnerability for Tajikistan. As noted by staff, the combination of strong economic
performance, restraint on new borrowing, and the recent agreements with Russia and
Pakistan have helped to significantly ease the debt burden. This is reflected in the current
external debt-to-GDP ratio of 40 percent, compared to 130 percent at end-2000. Our Tajik
authorities share staff’s view that over the medium-term the public sector debt level is
sustainable. They are aware, however, that the debt position remains highly exposed to
adverse shocks. In that regard, debt management will continue to be improved. Furthermore,
the National Bank of Tajikistan (NBT) is in the process of extending the monitoring of
external debt to private sector debt.
4.
As regards monetary policy, the NBT has been successful in significantly bringing
down inflation into the single-digit range, by focusing on stabilizing reserve money growth.
Also, net international reserves at end-2004 were higher than programmed. Looking forward,
maintaining low inflation remains the NBT’s main goal. To strengthen the implementation of

-2monetary policy, the NBT and Ministry of Finance will step up the pace in developing
market instruments.
5.
What is very encouraging, is the improvement in financial sector soundness, as
described in detail in the useful Selected Issues paper. The NBT is committed to build on the
success of past measures that have strengthened financial market supervision. The authorities
are fully aware that opening the banking system to reputable foreign banks can further
increase the efficiency and resilience of the financial system. Therefore, steps to liberalize
banking sector regulations are already envisaged.
6.
As regards fiscal policy, the authorities continue along their well-established path of
robust performance. Strong tax revenues, despite the delayed cotton exports, and expenditure
restraint has allowed for a lower-than-programmed overall government deficit in 2004,
amounting to 2.7 percent of GDP (including externally financed PIP). Our authorities are
very much aware of the need to make further progress in revenue mobilization, given the
strong demand for social and investment spending. As noted in the Memorandum of
Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP), they have made significant efforts to broaden the
tax base and strengthen tax collection. The simplification of tax rates and reduction of
exemptions under the revised tax and customs code that came onto force on January 1, 2005,
will increase tax revenues. Furthermore, the expansion of the Large Taxpayer Inspectorate
(LTI) will improve revenue mobilization.
7.
On the expenditure side, the authorities are appreciative of the agreement reached
with staff on significantly increasing the wage bill in the 2005 budget, while maintaining
overall current expenditure at the level programmed for last year. Increasing public sector
wages has been an important priority for the government for some time. As we argued during
the last Board meeting, the extremely low public wages in Tajikistan, in absolute terms as
well as compared to other CIS countries, were creating serious problems in terms of staff
retention and quality of services. Of course, the authorities are fully aware of the need to
combine wage increases with public sector reform. This is underscored by the near-term
measures recently formulated in a Presidential order and summarized in Annex I of the
MEFP. The authorities are confident that these measures, together with the conditioning of
the second tranche of the wage increase on the availability of revenue and moderate inflation,
provide a solid basis for the increase of the public wage bill.
Structural Reforms
8.
Reforming the agricultural sector remains a high priority for the authorities. As
underscored by staff, the high level of debt of the cotton sector is an important obstacle for
agricultural reform. Although the Fund is not taking the lead in this area, we would like to
briefly outline recent developments on this issue. Following substantial preparatory work in
defining a strategy to address the farmers’ debt in the cotton sector, the Farm Debts Strategy
(FDS) was recently finalized and approved by the President on March 4, 2005. Bilateral
donors, the World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank provided comprehensive inputs in
the development of the strategy. The basic features of the strategy is a case-by-case approach,
full transparency regarding the origins of the debts, and no use of government guarantees.

-3Our authorities have already started implementing some elements of the FDS and are
confident that it provides a good framework to resolve these longstanding debt issues.
9.
Reforms in the energy sector are continuing, with the focus on further improving
collection rates for gas and electricity from major energy debtors and households. The
metering of gas and electricity will be extended. The automatic quarterly adjustment of all
utility tariffs will continue to account for the depreciation of the nominal exchange rate. Our
authorities are giving particular attention to the problem of arrears in electricity payments by
the Tajik Aluminum Plant (TadAZ), which led to a breach of an indicative target under the
program. They are taking remedial action to enforce the payments. A new management team
was appointed for TadAZ, and requirements for TadAZ to remain current on their tax and
utility payments have been strengthened.
Poverty Reduction Strategy
10.
The authorities will continue to collaborate with the donor community and IFI’s in
reaching the PRSP’s objective. In that regard, there is encouraging evidence that progress is
being made. Poverty rates have declined significantly in recent years. Regarding the
shortcomings pointed out in the JSA of the PRSP, our authorities have started to address the
issues. In particular, they acknowledge the importance of improving participation in defining
budget priorities and of strengthening the budget process. In this respect, the Budgetary
Commission has now been established. Senior representatives are involved in identifying the
main budgetary priorities. The authorities also intend to develop a closer link between the
next PRSP and the five-year economic plan.
