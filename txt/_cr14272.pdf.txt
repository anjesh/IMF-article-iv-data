STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Economic context. Growth has been strong, inflation low, and fiscal buffers and
international reserves adequate. However, poverty and unemployment remain high,
despite large government spending financed from oil revenue. The business climate is
among the most challenging and the private credit-to-GDP ratio among the lowest in
sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).
Outlook and Risks. The economy is projected to expand by about 6 percent per annum
between 2014 and 2019, as new oil fields come on stream and an ambitious public
investment program is implemented to diversify the economy and make growth more
inclusive. Oil production is expected to peak in 2017. The medium-term outlook for non-oil
growth and poverty reduction hinges on progress addressing deep-seated structural
weaknesses and fiscal adjustment. Risks to the outlook relate to oil price volatility and
political instability.
Policies. Macroeconomic policies should focus on meeting the economy’s social and
development needs while mitigating risks to macroeconomic stability in the longer term.
 The growth of government spending should be arrested and the 2014 budget
should not be exceeded. Amid spending pressures related to the 2015 Africa Games
and the 2016 presidential elections, new fiscal developments should be reflected in a
supplementary budget in 2014 to enhance transparency.
 In view of the limited remaining lifetime of oil reserves, a gradual fiscal consolidation
should be targeted over the medium-term to safeguard fiscal and debt
sustainability. Ongoing efforts to address implementation and absorptive capacity
constraints need to be stepped up to maximize the benefits from public investments.
 Consideration should be given to adopt the non-oil primary balance as the fiscal
anchor.
 The private sector’s supply response to public infrastructure spending should be
maximized through implementation of reforms to improve the business climate,
support private investment, and develop the financial sector.
 The pilot project for cash transfers should be well-targeted and monitored to reduce
poverty.
 Compliance with reserves pooling requirements would insure the continued smooth
operation of the BEAC and the exchange rate peg, which both continue to serve the
Republic of Congo well.

BACKGROUND
1.
Recent economic developments in the Republic of Congo have been favorable. Growth
in the last 5 years has averaged about 5 percent per year, higher than in regional peers. The
country’s debt situation improved markedly as a result of the 2010 HIPC/MDRI debt relief. Gross oil
revenue averaged more than US$8 billion per year in 2012 and 2013, equivalent to about 60 percent
of GDP. Substantial fiscal savings have been set aside by virtue of the prevailing high international
oil prices.
2.
The 2012–16 National Development Plan (NDP) is in its third year of implementation.

coordination of policies and monitoring are needed to make growth inclusive and to strengthen
structural reform policies.
4.
Political context. Presidential elections are planned for 2016. Under the constitution
President Sassou N’guesso cannot be re-elected for a third seven-year term. Opposition parties are
pressing for electoral reforms, including to establish an independent electoral commission and to
verify the voter register. Recent turmoil in neighboring countries has so far not had material
spillovers.
5.
Progress in implementing the policy recommendations of the last two Article IV
consultations has been limited (Annex 1). The authorities breached the fiscal anchor introduced in
2013, and are exploring alternative anchors. A draft fiscal responsibility and transparency (FRT) law
has been prepared that would improve public financial management (PFM) but is yet to be
approved. There remains ample scope to improve the efficiency and quality of public expenditures.
6.
Against this background, this year’s consultation focused on the need to put the
economy on a path of fiscal consolidation while safeguarding targeted social spending and
growth-enhancing capital spending. Discussions also focused on the importance for the
authorities to make progress with initiatives to boost inclusive non-oil growth and address deepseated structural weaknesses impeding competitiveness. Staff liaised with Congo’s multilateral
development partners. They shared staff’s concerns about the efficiency of government spending,
highlighting the need for better prioritization and monitoring of public expenditures.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
7.
Macroeconomic developments in 2013 were broadly satisfactory. Growth fell to
3.3 percent in 2013, on declining oil production from aging oil wells. Non-oil growth continued to
be buoyed by favorable developments in the agriculture, construction, and services sectors. Inflation
decelerated to 2.1 percent in December 2013 (y/y), down from 7.5 percent a year earlier, aided by
lower food prices and CFA franc appreciation against the U.S. dollar.
8.
The overall fiscal balance remained in surplus in 2013 at 5.8 percent of GDP
(13.9 percent of non-oil GDP), up from 5.5 percent of GDP in 2012.


Notwithstanding continued high international oil prices, oil revenues declined by almost
11 percent of non-oil GDP, reflecting declining production and export volumes.



The basic non-oil primary balance (defined as the non-oil primary balance net of grants and
foreign-financed capital spending) improved by about 19.5 percentage points of non-oil
GDP to a deficit of 43.4 percent of non-oil GDP in 2013. Domestically-financed capital
spending was broadly in line with the budgeted amount and represented a decline of
9.9 percentage points of non-oil GDP. Current expenditures on transfers and common
charges fell short of the budget and declined by 7.7 percentage points of non-oil GDP.
Non-oil tax revenues over performed owing to rising non-oil private sector imports and

customs administration reforms that are being undertaken, including the establishment of a
one-stop window for customs clearance.


Foreign-financed capital spending increased by 6.7 percentage points of non-oil GDP to
18.7 percent of non-oil GDP as the execution rate improved to about 70 percent of the
budget, up from 54 percent in 2012.



Domestic arrears payments amounted to 6.4 percent of non-oil GDP in 2013, a near
doubling from 2012. The bulk of domestic arrears involve pension arrears and unpaid social
benefits, which started accumulating after the liquidation of public enterprises in the past as
dismissed employees were not fully compensated.

9.
The fiscal rule introduced by the authorities in 2013 was breached owing to settlement
of unbudgeted domestic arrears. Under the rule, CFAF 1,500 billion of oil revenue would be spent
(CFAF 1,000 billion on domestically financed capital expenditure and CFAF 500 billion on current
expenditure). The remainder would be saved. Accordingly, from the oil revenues of
CFAF 2,295 billion that materialized in 2013, CFAF 795 billion should have been saved. Instead,
savings amounting to about CFAF 629 billion (9.4 percent of GDP) were added to the government’s
deposits in China (Box 1).
10.
The 2014 budget envisages a decline in the surplus to 3.3 percent of GDP and again
targets government spending of about 100 percent of non-oil GDP:


An increase in the wage bill from hiring of new civil servants. The wage bill is budgeted to
increase by 18 percent in 2014 and by about 12 percent per year over the 2015–17 period,
reflecting the government’s agreement with labor unions to raise salaries by 50 percent from
2013 to 2016 as well as their plan to hire qualified educators and health-care workers.



A sizable increase in capital spending reflecting among other things: (i) the government’s
efforts to implement the NDP; (ii) ongoing construction and rehabilitation efforts related to
the 2012 ammunition explosion; (iii) the urbanization program (municipalisation accélérée);
and (iv) the need to build the infrastructure and facilities for the 2015 All Africa Games.



A modest increase in non-oil revenue, including from additional one-stop windows for
customs clearance.

11.
Against the backdrop of high oil prices, the overall balance of payments (BOP) remains
in surplus. The fiscal accounts suggest that the government’s bank deposits in China increased in
2013. Despite declining for the second year in a row, the Republic of Congo’s reserves at the BEAC
continue to cover about 7 months of prospective imports of goods and services.
12.
The ongoing stagnation in non–oil exports raises competitiveness concerns (Annex 2).
Competitiveness has been affected by the 11 percent appreciation of the Republic of Congo’s real
effective exchange rate (REER) from the 2012 average. This is a result of the strengthening of the
euro (to which the regional currency, the CFAF, is pegged) and the relatively higher inflation than in
trading partners. Competitiveness constraints also arise from the challenging overall business
environment that lags most countries in the world and regional peers (Figure 2) and the large social
and infrastructure gaps.

Box 1. Congo’s Economic Relationship with China
China has become the Republic of Congo’s most important development partner (Table 1). It has
operations ranging from development financing, direct investment, and technical assistance. It is also an
important trading partner. Currently, more than one-third of Congo’s annual oil and timber–the two major
export commodities–are exported to China; and Congo ranks among the top five major African trading
partners of China.

China’s financial assistance to the Republic of Congo has been growing significantly since 2006. The
cooperation with China has been supported by the 2006 strategic partnership agreement, which envisioned
concessional loans of about US$1.6 billion for key infrastructure projects. A second concessional agreement
with total disbursements of US$1 billion during 2013–16, is expected to sustain infrastructure investments.
Congo’s borrowing from China is on concessional terms—carrying a 5-year grace period, 20 years
maturity and a 0.25 percent interest rate. As a guarantee for the loans, the Congolese authorities are
required to keep a minimum deposit balance equivalent to about twenty percent of total outstanding loans
in an escrow account in China’s EXIM Bank from the proceeds of their oil sales to China. In recent years, the
higher remuneration on deposits at the EXIM Bank compared with government deposits at the BEAC
(currently less than one percent) has encouraged Congolese government deposits in China.

13.
Following three years of very rapid growth, commercial banks’ credit to the private
sector decelerated to 27 percent in March 2014 (y/y) amid declining deposit growth. However,
at less than 12 percent of GDP, the outstanding stock of credit to the private sector remains among
the lowest in SSA. Commercial banks lowered their lending rates from 13–14 percent in recent years
to around 7–10 percent in early 2014, reflecting excess liquidity in the banking system from lack of
lending opportunities as well as the 75 basis point reduction in the BEAC’s policy rate since
October 2013.
14.
External public debt has continued to trend upward. It reached 32 percent of GDP in
2013, up from 20 percent of GDP in 2010, when the Republic of Congo obtained HIPC/MDRI debt
relief. Most of Congo’s borrowing is on concessional terms from China and is targeted at financing
key infrastructure projects (Box 1).

The Republic of Congo’s favorable maiden sovereign credit rating issued in 2013 was
recently reaffirmed and is among the strongest in the region. The rating agencies credited the
Republic of Congo’s strong net asset position and robust growth prospects but also noted
weaknesses in the policy-making environment and data problems.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
16.
The near-term outlook for growth is favorable but inflation will likely drift up. The
economy is projected to expand by about 6 percent in 2014, on a technical rebound in oil
production and the start of iron ore production. Inflation is expected to inch up owing to demand
pressures from continued large government spending, which may be compounded by cost
pressures from the recent expulsion of about 80,000 low-paid illegal workers from the Democratic
Republic of Congo.
17.
The medium-term outlook is favorable but hinges on substantial progress with
structural reforms and fiscal adjustment. NDP implementation should be complemented by
efforts to improve the business climate and to implement targeted employment and social safety

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF CONGO

net programs. The high level of government spending and the exhaustibility of oil reserves, in
conjunction with concerns about absorptive and implementation capacity of government spending,
call for careful management of oil revenues. Therefore, and in line with the authorities’ stated
commitment, a core feature of the baseline scenario is a gradual reduction in the non-oil primary
deficit to about 30 percent of non-oil GDP over the next five years, down from about 60 percent of
non-oil GDP in 2013. A further reduction would be in order over the long term to help build an
endowment the size of which would depend on average investment returns. This endowment could
support government spending in the post-oil era while allowing room to implement the
government’s public investment program (Annex 3).
18.
An alternative scenario in which fiscal consolidation is delayed illustrates the
downsides of continued high government spending (see Debt Sustainability Analysis, DSA). In
this scenario, fiscal adjustment would be postponed. Declining oil revenues would be replaced by
funds borrowed from abroad, possibly by taking advantage of the favorable sovereign credit rating.
The higher government spending (compared to the baseline) would initially provide a boost to
overall growth but higher inflation would erode competitiveness and deteriorate the current
account. The buildup in external debt over the medium term to finance the higher spending would
eventually trigger an abrupt fiscal adjustment. The result in the medium to long term would be a
loss of competitiveness, lower growth and a worse overall net external position compared to the
baseline scenario of fiscal consolidation. A DSA run on the “alternative policy scenario” would
suggest significantly higher debt vulnerabilities and entail a rating downgrade. Box 2 discusses the
tradeoffs related to scaling-up public investment.
19.
There are upside and downside risks to the outlook (Annex 4). A protracted period of
slower growth in advanced and emerging economies and a sharp slowdown in growth in China, by
weighing on international prices of commodities, could reduce oil revenues. To the extent that this
gives rise to a reduction in government spending this could reduce growth in the Republic of
Congo. Social tensions and political instability resulting from inequality and poor job opportunities
could also adversely affect the outlook. Conversely, geopolitical tensions could cause international
oil prices to rise. Moreover, the discovery of new oil reserves and the earlier-than-expected start of
new mining projects would provide more time and financial resources to prepare for the post-oil
era.
Authorities’ Views
20.
The authorities were in broad agreement with the fiscal adjustment path underlying
the baseline scenario and risks to the outlook. They were more optimistic regarding the mediumterm outlook for the mining sector noting that several projects were moving closer to the
production stage. The authorities highlighted their programs to increase agricultural sector
productivity. They were hopeful that their efforts to put in place basic infrastructure (access to
potable water, expansion of paved-roads network, and access to electricity), particularly in the rural
areas, and to improve the business climate and health and education systems would lead to higher
non-oil growth and poverty reduction over the medium term.

Box 2. Public Investment, Debt Sustainability and Savings Tradeoffs
The Republic of Congo’s projected decline in oil revenue poses a challenge for the design of public
investment paths that can foster economic growth while ensuring fiscal and debt sustainability. To analyze
this issue, the Debt, Investment, Growth and Natural Resources (DIGNAR) model developed by the IMF’s
Research Department was applied. The model takes into account the projected paths for the oil price, oil
production, public investment, concessional debt as well as oil revenues.
Simulations were carried out with three alternative investment paths: (i) the baseline scenario described
earlier consistent with the authorities fiscal consolidation objectives and commitments, (ii) the “alternative
policy” scenario and (iii) a “high investment until 2017” scenario. Moreover, to study the impact of PFM
reforms and structural reforms, a sustained steady increase in investment efficiency was considered. Finally,
in order to analyze the downside risks posed by a decline in the oil price (production), a scenario with a
lower path for oil revenues was considered.
The model and its simulations yielded the following main results:



The baseline scenario delivers the best outcome in terms of public capital and debt sustainability
and allows a buildup of savings. The ratio of public debt to GDP settles at around 35 percent in the
long run.



An aggressive scaling up of public investment can pose a threat to fiscal sustainability. In the
“alternative policy” scenario, the public debt to GDP ratio reaches 120 percent and savings fall to
the statutory minimum requirement.



An increase in investment efficiency through credible and sustained PFM reforms and improvement
in the business environment would allow for a relatively faster buildup of capital without adversely
affecting the debt ratio or savings.



An unexpected decrease in oil revenues (from a fall in oil prices or production) can result in a
relatively fast decline in savings and increase the level of public debt in the long run.

21.
The authorities reiterated their commitment to anchoring fiscal policy in a prudent
way. They noted that they had observed the spirit of the 2013 fiscal rule. However, savings fell short
owing to the need to settle unbudgeted arrears and because of below-budget oil revenues. In
practice, however, they considered that the present anchor has a number of problems, foremost that
the absolute level of savings is not guaranteed.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Strengthening the Fiscal Framework
22.
Staff advised the authorities to anchor fiscal policy on a non-oil primary balance rule
that insulates spending from oil revenue volatility while ensuring medium-term fiscal and
debt sustainability and supporting growth. The authorities’ fiscal anchor introduced in 2013
would help to protect government spending from oil price volatility but could be further
strengthened by taking into account oil exhaustibility over the medium term. In particular, staff
recommended anchoring fiscal policy on a gradual reduction in the non-oil primary deficit that takes
into account public investment needs and the effect of this type of investment on growth while

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF CONGO

preserving medium-term fiscal sustainability. The authorities are also encouraged to follow up on
the recommendations on the reform of fiscal anchors in the forthcoming 2014 CEMAC Article IV
consultation report.
23.
In view of the short-term spending pressures, staff underscored the importance of
meeting the fiscal targets in the 2014 budget. The aging of existing oil wells and recent technical
difficulties to sustain oil production caused gross oil export revenue to decline, thus illustrating the
uncertain outlook for oil production and revenues. Including the large foreign-financed capital
spending, the 2014 budget would imply a 22 percent increase in total government spending
compared to the outturn in 2013. The acceleration of foreign-financed capital spending would raise
the Republic of Congo’s external debt to about 38 percent of GDP by the end of 2014, up from 32
percent of GDP projected for end-2013. Ideally, a supplementary budget would formalize changes
to fiscal targets, particularly in case the 2015 All Africa Games would require additional spending.
24.
Efforts to enhance the effectiveness of spending should be stepped up. Projects should
be analyzed and prioritized carefully to maximize their impact on productivity and poverty
reduction. Implementation of projects with a more limited impact on medium-term growth and
poverty reduction should be scaled back particularly in view of absorption and implementation
capacity constraints. Also, by foregoing lower-priority capital investment projects, maintenance costs
in later years would be commensurately lower. The authorities are also encouraged to contain fiscal
risks relating to their plans to establish a special fund for guarantees and support (FIGA—Fonds
d’Impulsion de Garantie et d’Accompagnement), which is designed to aid the creation of small and
medium-size enterprises (SMEs). Particularly, there should be an annual report and assessment of
the fiscal risks involved with the FIGA.
25.
The design of the fiscal consolidation package matters for achieving the government’s
distributional and efficiency objectives while supporting growth. To the extent that the fiscal
consolidation is based on progressive tax and expenditure measures, vulnerable households can be
protected from the adjustment. For example, fuel subsidies in the Republic of Congo (about 3.6
percent of GDP in 2010) likely benefit the better off (see Selected Issues Paper (SIP) on Equitable
Fiscal Consolidation). In this regard, staff welcomes the authorities’ intention to focus more on
critical social spending and to develop a comprehensive social safety net system.
Authorities’ Views
26.
The authorities noted that they were discussing ideas for a dynamic fiscal anchor, with
all options on the table, including staff’s proposal to target a declining path for the non-oil primary
deficit. They highlighted that the Republic of Congo has consistently met the CEMAC convergence
criteria of a positive basic fiscal balance. While underscoring their vast investment needs, they were
cognizant of the risk of excessive debt-financed investments. If necessary, they would table a
supplementary budget to revise their spending plans. The authorities noted that, apart from the
initial capital injection, the FIGA has to generate its own revenues and be self-sufficient. Also, project
proposals under the FIGA would be carefully appraised and the use of credit monitored.

B. Strengthening Public Financial Management
27.
Some encouraging steps have recently been taken to strengthen PFM. Preparations to
implement some of the CEMAC directives on PFM, including with Fund technical assistance (TA),
have been initiated. Since the adoption of a new Organic Budget Law (LORFE) in 2012, the
authorities have engaged in a number of projects for strengthening and reforming the PFM system.
These efforts include work on improving the expenditure management under the IT system (SIDERE),
and program budgeting has started being developed. A law on FRT has also been drafted recently.
This law would establish guiding principles for other PFM laws and includes provisions on natural
resources revenue transparency. The draft law, which aims, on the whole to establish a more
transparent fiscal framework, would assign oversight responsibility to a new body.
28.
Significant efforts remain for addressing the PFM system’s weaknesses. In this context,
full advantage should be taken of the ongoing Public Expenditure Management and Financial
Accountability Review (PEMFAR). The PEMFAR, which is conducted by the World Bank and other
development partners, should help identify steps to improve budget execution and procurement
and disbursement processes. For example, reducing the number of steps in the procurement
process would speed up the implementation of projects under the NDP. The public expenditure
review in key sectors could form the basis for action plans to improve the efficiency and quality of
spending. Staff encouraged the authorities to complete the audit of domestic arrears as a matter of
priority and to put in place a repayment plan that is included in medium-term budget planning.
Moreover, to improve budget execution and prevent the accumulation of arrears, the authorities
were encouraged to focus on: (i) real-time reporting of budget implementation (tax revenues and
expenditure) through centralized accounting systems; and (ii) improving treasury management and
forecasting, including unifying data reporting at the central level, enhancing the reliability of
revenue and expenditure forecasts as well as their monthly adjustments, and entrusting the
centralized cash flow management to a dedicated team.
Authorities’ Views
29.
The authorities noted their intention to move ahead with the FRT law. The authorities
also indicated that Fund PFM TA would be most beneficial if it would be timed with the drafting of
new legislation. They reaffirmed that they are continuing to work with the World Bank and the EU to
improve aspects of financial transparency and responsibility in the context of the PEMFAR and that
they are in the process of implementing reforms regarding real time reporting and centralized
accounting. An audit of domestic arrears is underway; pension arrears will be audited separately
from commercial arrears. Depending on the size of commercial arrears, a multi-year repayment plan
would be put in place.

C. Financial Sector Issues
30.
Overall compliance with the regional prudential ratios remains broadly adequate in
the aggregate but the financial sector remains underdeveloped (see SIP on Financial Inclusion,
Development, and Risks). The ratio of non-performing loans to total loans has remained low and
banks have maintained capital above the minimum levels (8 percent, Table 7). Lack of credible

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF CONGO

collateral and inadequate protection of creditors’ rights continues to hinder financial sector
development. Banks remain averse to channel loans to SMEs in spite of ample liquidity. Despite a
steady increase in private sector credit and the development of microfinance and mobile banking
outperforming regional trends, financial access in Congo—measured as the proportion of
population with access to formal financial accounts—remains among the lowest in the CEMAC and
CFA Franc Zone. Banks’ business models rely on fees and commissions related to bank services and
transfers. One bank is implementing an action plan to comply with the financial supervisor’s
(COBAC) regulations by mid-2014.
31.
The policy agenda should include measures to address the main barriers to financial
access. The authorities should expedite actions to address problems regarding legislation, property
rights and documentation to support access to finance. Actions should include: (i) strengthening the
judicial framework by boosting the judges’ and tribunals’ capacities to address financial sector
issues; (ii) implementing a centralized balance sheet bureau (Centrale des bilans) to strengthen the
quality of accounting data; and (iii) establishing a property registry (Fonds National du Cadastre) and
a unique window to register land titles. The efforts to create a good environment for microfinance
and mobile banking should continue by fostering collaboration between commercial banks and
microfinance institutions and telecommunication companies. Ongoing implementation of the
electronic payment system for taxes and utilities has to move forward and development of the
banking branches network encouraged. Efforts to strengthen the quality of information available at
the central risk bureau (Centrale des risques) and the central payment incident bureau (Centrale des
incidents de paiement) should continue.
Authorities’ Views
32.
The authorities reaffirmed their commitment to continue to work with the regional
authorities on strengthening the regional regulatory and supervisory system. They highlighted
their efforts to increase and monitor credit to SME’s for carefully appraised projects. The authorities
also noted their efforts to strengthen the implementation of the Anti-Money Laundering/Countering
the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) framework, including through outreach and training.

D. Structural Reforms for Inclusive Growth
33.
The authorities have recently reinforced targeted social expenditures and safety net
programs in the context of a new labor market policy. The finalization of a previously initiated
National Employment Policy is pending review by stakeholders. However, a range of measures have
been introduced to address skills mismatches that exacerbate unemployment. This includes
strengthening and expanding the coverage of technical and vocational programs as well as
implementation of programs to support rural job creation and self-employment. There are also
plans to introduce training to meet the needs of the mining sector this year. Preparations are
underway for the pilot cash transfer program (Lisungi) to the poor for spending on health and
education services with the assistance of the World Bank. Food stamp and school-lunch programs
were implemented in 2014.

34.
The government is making efforts to create employment and diversify the economy by
creating four special economic zones (SEZs) (SIP on SEZs). The legal framework governing the
zones has not yet been finalized, but the 2014 budget law extends preferential incentives to SEZs.
Given the narrow tax base and high dependence of government revenue on the oil sector, strict
controls should be put in place to avoid abuse of the favorable fiscal regime. Staff encouraged the
authorities to prevent the proliferation of tax incentives and exemptions in SEZs. The impact on
direct and indirect tax expenditure should be quantified and monitored.
35.
Efforts to improve the business climate should be intensified. The Republic of Congo
ranked 185th out of 189 countries in the 2014 World Bank’s Doing Business Survey. This is in spite of
recent steps to improve the business environment that have been taken in the context of an interministerial action plan in collaboration with the International Finance Corporation (IFC). In the short
term, the authorities plan to streamline administrative procedures and costs pertaining to
registering enterprises, construction permits, access to electricity, cross-border trade, access to land,
as well as take measures to protect investors. An Investment Promotion Agency established last year
is in the process of identifying relevant sectors in which investments could be promoted.
Authorities‘ View
36.
The authorities acknowledged that the fiscal incentives to SEZs entail loss of revenue.
However, they considered that the losses incurred in the short term would be recouped in the long
term as the tax expenditures would create employment and promote industrialization. The
authorities agreed on the need to be vigilant and to ensure that the tax incentives do not become
widespread and encourage rent seeking behavior. The authorities highlighted their commitment to
strengthening social safety nets and ameliorating the business environment. They argued that due
to the timing of implementation of some measures, the 2014 Doing Business rating did not yet
reflect all the measures that they had implemented.

E. Asset and Liability Management and Other Issues
37.
Staff urged compliance with CEMAC reserve repatriation obligations. Staff pointed out
that membership in the CFA franc zone has served Congo well as an anchor for financial stability. To
preserve orderly reserve management and monetary policy effectiveness in the CFA franc zone, staff
urged the authorities to work with the BEAC and other member states to achieve a regional
consensus on reserve management, including on their plan to establish a Sovereign Wealth Fund
(SWF) that was adopted in late 2013. Staff recommended the SWF not invest in the domestic
economy in order not to undermine the fiscal discipline to be enhanced by the authorities’ fiscal
anchor.
38.
An updated Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) maintains Congo’s low risk of debt
distress rating. The recent increase in the volatility of Congo’s exports along with the trend increase
in external debt results in one of the standard stress tests breaching the policy-dependent
thresholds. This would normally give rise to a reclassification of Republic of Congo to “moderate risk
of debt distress.” However, in view of the government’s large deposits at the BEAC (60 percent of
external public debt) which are more than fully covered by gross official foreign reserves at the
BEAC, Congo continues to be classified as at “low risk of debt distress.”
39.
Efforts to strengthen debt management need to be stepped up in view of Congo’s
trend increase in debt. Developing a medium-term debt strategy and enhancing transparency in
debt management in line with the recommendations of ongoing MCM TA would become
particularly important if the authorities choose to tap international capital markets. A sovereign
bond issuance should be the outcome of careful consideration of the nature and expected return of
the investments the authorities plan to finance with the bond proceeds, and the comparative costs
of alternative financing, including from the authorities’ own reserves.
40.
The authorities need to improve policy coordination and monitoring. This would be
instrumental in ameliorating the efficiency and effectiveness of macroeconomic and structural
reform policies. In the same vein, serious shortcomings in data strength and timeliness need to be
overcome, including by introducing monitorable time bound targets to measure progress. Reforms
are taking place at the National Institute of Statistics (NIS), building on IMF TA received on national
accounts and government finance statistics. Improved reporting of data on official holdings of
foreign exchange would enhance the transparency of government operations and complement the
commitments Congo has made in the context of its membership of the EITI. It would also bolster
confidence in macroeconomic management.
Authorities’ View
41.
The authorities noted their support for the BEAC working group that is putting
forward proposals to deal with partial compliance with reserves repatriation requirements,
including drawing on discussions with the IMF. The authorities noted that they intend to establish
the SWF at the BEAC in accordance with the regional fiscal and saving framework. The aim of the
SWF would be to invest part of the oil savings in higher-yielding foreign assets to preserve financial
wealth for future generations.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

REPUBLIC OF CONGO

42.
The authorities intend to continue to pursue a prudent debt management policy that
would maintain a strong net external position. Large infrastructure and development projects are
expected to continue to be financed from external borrowing on highly concessional terms.

STAFF APPRAISAL
43.
Economic performance continues to be broadly satisfactory. Growth is expected to pick
up to about 6 percent in 2014 on a technical rebound in oil production and the start of mining
production as well as continued strong non-oil growth supported by the government’s large
investment program. Inflation is likely to remain contained thanks to the peg of the CFA franc to the
euro. Several years of high oil prices have allowed substantial fiscal savings and gross official
reserves remain adequate. However, Congo’s real effective exchange rate is somewhat overvalued.
Also, the track record on lowering poverty and fuel subsidies has been poor.
44.
Significant policy actions are needed to translate oil revenues into sustainable,
inclusive non-oil growth. Despite large government spending, poverty and unemployment remain
high. The government budget relies heavily on oil revenue. Therefore, oil price volatility and the
exhaustibility of oil reserves could pose risks to macroeconomic stability and the authorities’
objective of attaining high, and sustained inclusive non-oil growth over the medium term.
45.
Putting the economy on a sustainable path requires arresting the growth of
government spending and putting the economy on a path of fiscal consolidation, as outlined
in the baseline scenario. While the authorities’ introduction of the 2013 fiscal anchor represented
an encouraging first step in this direction, it should be strengthened further by explicitly linking the
anchor to the exhaustibility of oil reserves and targeting a gradual reduction in the non-oil primary
deficit while safeguarding targeted social spending and growth-enhancing capital spending. The rise
in government debt after the HIPC/MDRI relief, underscores the importance of continued adherence
to a prudent borrowing and expenditure policy and to build up savings. Adequate measures should
be taken to meet the 2014 budget targets, particularly as spending pressures related to construction
for the 2015 All-Africa Games and the 2016 presidential elections are likely to continue. A
supplementary budget is needed to formalize changes to fiscal targets.
46.
Efficient implementation of the ambitious investment program is critical to diversify
the economy and promote employment. The lack of basic infrastructure (water, electricity, roads),
and effective education and health systems are hampering private investment. The selection,
evaluation, and monitoring of investment projects as well as the budgeting of their operating and
maintenance costs need to be strengthened. The link between the actions envisaged in the NDP and
the annual budgets should be clearly established during budget preparation.
47.
PFM reforms are important to improve accountability, governance, and the quality of
public spending. The authorities are encouraged to follow up on recommendations from the
ongoing PEMFAR to strengthen budget execution, procurement and disbursement processes and
improve the efficiency and quality of spending. The authorities should complete the audit of
domestic arrears as a matter of priority and put in place a repayment plan that is included in
medium-term budget planning. Over the medium-term, strengthening treasury management,
18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF CONGO

spending control and procedures should help prevent further accumulation of arrears. Over the long
term, addressing the main weaknesses of the PFM system and implementing the provisions of the
LORFE and future law on FRT will imply significant changes to the PFM system, reinforced capacities,
and a robust project management. The draft FRT law should be implemented expeditiously and
remain consistent with international best practice.
48.
The Republic of Congo’s medium-term prospects hinge on progress with structural
reforms. The sustained growth of activity outside the oil sector would need to be supported by
provision of adequate infrastructure, continued reforms to strengthen the business climate in line
with the IFC-supported action plan, furthering financial development and increasing access to
finance by strengthening the legal and information systems. There should be a careful analysis of
the implications of the fiscal incentives for SEZs that were introduced in the 2014 budget law. The
government’s programs to strengthen the education system to improve the matching of workers’
skills with the needs of the private sector and to implement social spending to the poor, including
through the Lisungi cash transfer program that is being rolled out, should be well-targeted and
evaluated and monitored regularly to ensure their effectiveness.
49.
Congo should fully comply with its CEMAC obligations. Staff urges the authorities to
continue to support the ongoing review of CEMAC’s reserves pooling framework and to fully
observe relevant commitments to ensure the continued smooth operation of the BEAC and the
pegged exchange rate arrangement. In this respect, the authorities should make certain that the
planned establishment of a SWF investing in higher-yielding foreign assets is consistent with the
CEMAC reserves pooling framework.
50.
Efforts to strengthen macroeconomic statistics should continue. The authorities’ efforts
to reform the National Institute of Statistics, including with IMF technical assistance, are important
to strengthen macroeconomic analysis and policymaking. The authorities should also step up efforts
to ensure the timely provision of information to the Fund regarding the standard macroeconomic
data that is required for effective surveillance. Transparency on foreign assets holdings can help to
bolster confidence in macroeconomic management.
51.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard
12-month cycle.

(RRDCs). This methodology permits that
investing resource wealth at home may be more profitable than saving most of the resource windfall
abroad, for example in the face of overseas borrowing constraints. In this setting, the returns to
public and private capital are higher than the interest rate earned on official reserves. Therefore it is
optimal to invest part of the natural resource revenues domestically in public and private capital,
instead of saving it all abroad. The model also allows for absorptive capacity constraints in the
economy. Application of this model points to a mild overvaluation of the REER, in the order of 6 to
8 percent. The implementation of the more traditional external sustainability approach (which does
not take account the particular features of RRDCs mentioned above) indicates an overvaluation of
4 to 6 percent. Nonetheless, these results are affected by considerable estimation uncertainty.
54.
Competitiveness continues to be undermined by a poor overall business environment.

However, reforms are being put in place. The authorities are undertaking reforms to the
business climate in the context of an inter-ministerial action plan in collaboration with the
International Finance Corporation (IFC) that was set up in 2013. Some of these reforms that were
undertaken in 2013, in particular the implementation of a one stop shop for customs clearance, were
not reflected in the 2014 Doing Business ranking due to timing issues. Going forward, specific
measures that will be implemented under the plan include the reinforcement of investor protection
by increasing the number of magistrates at the commerce tribunal; a reduction in the number of
procedures required to obtain construction permits; and a reduction in the number of formalities
required to import and export. Furthermore, the recently created investment promotion agency is in
the process of identifying priority sectors in which competitiveness should be promoted through
inward investment and technology transfer. The creation of Special Economic Zones throughout the
country is also part of the government’s strategy to promote industrial competitiveness of key
industries in the petroleum, agricultural and services sectors.

Annex III. Republic of Congo: Anchoring Fiscal Policy in the
Medium Term
The Republic of Congo introduced a fiscal rule in January 2013 to delink fiscal policy from volatile oil
revenues and build wealth for future generations. The rule was however breached in its first year of
operation and the authorities are examining options for redefining the rule. A prudent fiscal policy that
targets a gradual reduction in the non oil primary deficit over time would ensure fiscal sustainability,
while at the same time implementing the government’s investment program aimed at diversifying the
economy and building up wealth buffers for the future. An alternative scenario illustrates the risks from
a sharp increase in government spending in the next few years.

A. Background
1.
In January 2013, the Congolese authorities implemented a fiscal rule in order to
secure long term fiscal sustainability in the context of exhaustible oil resources. The fiscal rule
envisioned the allocation of CFAF 1,500 billion of oil revenues to current (CFAF 500 billion) and
capital (CFAF 1,000 billion) expenditures each year. The remainder would be saved in government
deposits. This would protect the budget from oil revenue volatility, prevent fiscal policy
procyclicality, and permit the authorities to implement their ambitious program of investment.
2.
However, the rule was breached by a wide margin in its first year of operation.
According to the rule, from the CFAF 2,295 billion of oil revenues in 2013, CFAF 795 billion should
have been saved at the BEAC. However, unbudgeted arrears payments held back government
savings. At the same time, government deposits at the BEAC declined. The Congolese authorities are
currently considering options to redefine the fiscal rule to take into account fiscal sustainability
concerns and the need to diversify the economy away from the hydrocarbon sector.
3.
This note examines a new fiscal rule that takes into account fiscal and debt
sustainability concerns and the exhaustibility of oil resources in the medium term. The
objective of such a rule is to put government expenditures on a sustainable path, such that they
become less dependent on oil revenues that are volatile and are projected to decline over the
medium term (Table 1). To prepare the economy for a future without hydrocarbon resources, the
rule should also permit the authorities to implement their ambitious infrastructure investment
program (in line with absorptive capacity constraints) to diversify the economy and build up wealth
buffers for future generations.

Corresponds to the total of net financial assets and present value of future government oil revenue.

B. Policy Anchor
4.
Given the relatively short term horizon of Congo’s oil resources, the authorities should
explicitly target the Non Resource Primary Balance (NRPB) as the anchor for fiscal policy. This
approach would help to delink fiscal policy from the volatility of oil revenues and avoid the need to
adjust spending abruptly when oil revenues are exhausted, which would negatively impact economic
activity. It would also address fiscal sustainability concerns.
5.
The first option that is available as a guide for setting the trajectory of the NRPB is
based on the Permanent Income Hypothesis (PIH). This involves setting the NPRB at a level
consistent with current accumulated financial wealth, as well as that expected to accrue in the future
from natural resources. The main downside of this approach is that it does not permit the
government to use part of its natural resource wealth to undertake a period of ‘scaling up’
investment to develop the domestic capital stock.
6.
The Fiscal Sustainability Framework (FSF) takes into account an intertemporal budget
constraint and incorporates ex–ante the growth impact of a higher initial investment
program. In contrast to the PIH, the focus here is not on the preservation of the full amount of
financial wealth. In this framework, fiscal sustainability is consistent with a non–oil primary balance
that allows a drawdown of government wealth (with spending on human and physical capital). It

entails a gradual increase in non–oil revenues, which stems from the diversification program and
avoids a sudden reduction in government expenditure.

8.
The accumulated level of net financial
assets will depend on the average return on investment. Accumulated net financial assets are
composed of two parts: the initial value and the present discounted value of future oil revenues until
end 2034. Assuming a long-term interest rate ranging between 3.5 to 6.5 percent, net financial
assets would reach a level between 71 percent and 124 percent of non–oil GDP by 2034.5
9.
Careful note should be taken of absorptive capacity constraints and the quality of
investment projects. The quality of investment projects is critical in determining the effect of
investment on projected growth and non–oil revenues, and hence the adjustment path of the NRPB.
Care should be taken in the choice of projects to ensure that they maximize such ‘fiscal returns’.
Project selection should also balance the growth impact of investment with the institutional capacity
required for implementation.
10.
The implementation of a fiscal rule in Congo should also bear in mind regional
considerations. The fiscal sustainability framework outlined above is broadly consistent with the

5

The proposed consolidation path is consistent with the principles and international experience summarized in the
2012 IMF Policy Paper on Macroeconomic Policy Frameworks for Resource-Rich Developing Countries. The 2014
Article IV mission provided the authorities hands-on explanations on applying the fiscal sustainability framework to
calibrate fiscal adjustment paths. A similar analysis in the 2013 Article IV Staff Report (Country Report No. 13/282)
found that the NRPB should be stabilized at a level consistent with maintaining total net wealth at slightly under 200
percent of non–oil GDP. The difference between the two analyses is attributed to subsequent downward revisions in
the authorities projections for growth in the non-oil sector, in particular in the forestry and construction and public
works sectors.

consistent with all the convergence criteria.

D. Alternative Policy Scenario

expenditures in the immediate term. Under the alternative policy scenario, government

High
Lower oil prices/production would lower
exports and government revenues and
could result in postponement of some
investment activities. Absent a
strengthening of the expected fiscal
consolidation, government foreign currency
deposits would be quickly drawn down and
there could be greater reliance on foreign
borrowing.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to
materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding
the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and
“high” a probability of 30 percent or more). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the
time of discussions with the authorities. Non mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

Fund as of end-2004 that remains outstanding at the time the member qualifies for such debt relief.

Implementation of Post-Catastrophe Debt Relief (PCDR): Not Applicable
Decision point - point at which the IMF and the World Bank determine whether a country qualifies
for assistance under the HIPC Initiative and decide on the amount of assistance to be committed.
Interim assistance - amount disbursed to a country during the period between decision and
completion points, up to 20 percent annually and 60 percent in total of the assistance committed at
the decision point (or 25 percent and 75 percent, respectively, in exceptional circumstances).
Completion point - point at which a country receives the remaining balance of its assistance
committed at the decision point, together with an additional disbursement of interest income as
defined in footnote 2 above. The timing of the completion point is linked to the implementation of
pre-agreed key structural reforms (i.e., floating completion point).

Safeguards Assessment:
Consistent with the safeguards policy requirement for regional central banks, the BEAC was subject
to a quadrennial assessment in 2013. It occurred against the backdrop of significant change at the
BEAC to address governance challenges and control failures that emerged in 2009, and led to close
engagement in the period after through close IMF monitoring of safeguards “rolling measures” in
the context of new program requests and reviews for CEMAC countries. The 2013 assessment found
that risks remain elevated and that annual IMF staff visits to monitor priority recommendations and
progress on the BEAC’s reform plan would continue as part of the safeguards “rolling measures”
approach.7 Consistent with this approach, a safeguards staff visit to the BEAC was conducted from
April 1–9. Staff concluded that the BEAC has made good progress in implementing
recommendations from the 2013 assessment and is advancing its reform plan to strengthen controls
at the bank. That said, the BEAC continues to face challenges on institutional autonomy and broader
governance reforms remain paramount in the medium-term. Staff will maintain close engagement
with the BEAC to assess sustainability of the measures already in place and implementation of the
reforms and new safeguards measures going forward. Developments on implementation of these
measures will allow staff to consider whether sufficient progress has been made to discontinue the
annual monitoring of safeguards rolling measures and thereby revert to the four-year cycle of full
safeguards assessments for regional central banks.

F. Nonfinancial Relations
Exchange Rate Arrangement:
The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangement of the Central African Monetary Union (CAMU)
is a conventional peg. The Republic of Congo participates in the CAMU and has no separate legal
tender. The regional currency is the CFA franc, which is pegged to the Euro at a fixed rate of
CFAF 655.95 =Euro 1. Congo does not impose any restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers for current international transactions.
Article IV consultations:
Following completion of the three-year Extended Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement in August 2011,
consultations with Congo are now on a 12-month cycle, based on the Board decision on Article IV
consultation cycles. The last Article IV consultation discussions were held in Brazzaville on
April 29-May 13, 2013. The staff report (Country Report No. 13/282 at www.imf.org) was approved by
the Executive Board on a lapse of time basis without a meeting on August 30, 2013.

Staff has been conducting annual monitoring of safeguards developments at the BEAC since 2010.

WORLD BANK—IMF JOINT ACTION PLAN
The IMF and the World Bank teams maintain an ongoing exchange of views on relevant
macroeconomic and structural issues in the Republic of Congo. Cooperation during the last year has
included discussions related to the macroeconomic situation in Republic of Congo; the ongoing
Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Review (PEMFAR); progress in the
achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDG); and updates on the status of World Bank
country programs. These World Bank country programs are aimed at improving competitiveness and
development outcomes and include a conditional cash transfer program and measures to improve
rural area productivity through investment in roads, programs to develop seeds and the training of
farmers. A full DSA is jointly prepared by the two teams for the 2014 Article IV consultations; a
DSA—full or update—will also be conducted in 2015.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
As of June 27, 2014

A. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance with some key data shortcomings
in national accounts, monetary, fiscal, and external sector statistics due to capacity constraints.
National Accounts: National accounts data is weak, with inconsistencies both internally and
with balance of payments statistics. The Directorate General of Statistics (DGS) of the Ministry
of Finance (MoF) provides Fund missions with a breakdown of GDP by expenditures and
sectors, both in nominal and real terms. In the context of moving to the SNA93 system of
accounts, the DGS completed the national accounts estimates for 2005 (the new base year) and
for 2006–07, with the assistance of a resident statistical expert and AFRITAC Central. The
authorities are currently working with the AFRITAC Central to revise national accounts’
estimates up to 2012. Annual data on employment in the central government are available
from the MoF. As part of the structural reforms undertaken in the context of the post-conflict
program, the government completed an audit of public service employees.
Price Statistics: Movements in the prices of commodities consumed by households are
recorded for the capital city of Brazzaville and for Pointe Noire, the center of economic
activities. Data are compiled on a monthly basis. Since August 2010, the authorities introduced
a new CPI measure with new weights and a new composition of the basket of goods and
services. This new CPI is harmonized with that of other countries in the Central African
Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC).
Government Finance Statistics:. Data provision has become sporadic since end-2011 and is
limited to central government above the line transactions and for transactions for some
extrabudgetary units. The authorities have recently set up a centralized reporting system to
improve the monitoring of budget execution and the timely availability of data. The result of
this initiative is still to be seen. Progress is underway to increase the comprehensiveness of the
data through the adoption of systematic compilation practices and steps have been taken to
computerize expenditure chain accounting. However, the recording of fiscal financing in the
official table of financial operations of the State is incomplete and results in large, unexplained
statistical discrepancies. On the ground collection of data related to local government units is
good. However, there is a lack of consistency / transparency between above the line and below
the line transactions, particularly as relates to oil revenues. There are also inconsistencies and
lags related to consolidation and intra – governmental transfers. Reliable balance sheet (e.g.
debt) data is nonexistent. Future technical assistance efforts could focus on expanding the
institutional coverage to include social security operations and the accounts of SNPC (the
nationalized oil company). A more comprehensive financial balance sheet could be produced
to fully capture the public sector assets / liability position. The Caisse Congolaise
d’Amortissement (CCA) produces data on the outstanding stock of external public debt,
including arrears and their composition, together with detailed projections on debt service due.
These data are provided to Fund missions. However, the debt stock data cannot readily be
reconciled with flow data in the fiscal accounts. The CCA also produces domestic debt data.
Concerns still exist with regard to the reconciliation of fiscal and monetary statistics. There is no
centralized, comprehensive database on the operations of public enterprises. The Republic of

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF CONGO

Congo reported (in September 2008) GFS data to STA for fiscal years 2004 and 2005 using the
GFSM 2001 template—data for 2006–10 has experienced delays. High-frequency fiscal data has
not yet been reported for publication in IFS. The compilation of GFS statistics to be reported to
the Fund should be carried out in close cooperation with the division in charge of statistics on
financial operations of the government.
Monetary Statistics Monetary statistics are reported to the Fund by the Banque des États de
l’Afrique Centrale (BEAC) on a monthly basis in the format of the standardized report forms
(SRFs). The depository corporation survey does not include data from deposit taking
microfinance institutions, a growing sector in the country. It is hoped to include data in the
future on interest rates offered by the financial institutions sector to non-financial entities on
deposits and loans.
Balance of payments: Although BEAC produces balance of payments data, delays occur and
data suffers from significant inconsistencies with other datasets. The opacity surrounding
certain transactions in the oil sector introduces an extra layer of imprecision. Balance of
payments data through 2007 are published in the Fund’s International Financial Statistics (IFS),
and STA is working with the authorities in updating the data series. In February 2007, a followup STA balance of payments statistics mission made a number of recommendations aimed at
improving institutional arrangements for balance of payments statistics compilation and
validation. Progress in this regard has been slow, delaying the process for finalizing BoP data
for 2005–10. The balance of payments committee, in charge of data reconciliation, validated
the BoP for 2008; the validation for subsequent years is still pending as the committee does not
meet on a regular basis. Data on the International Investment Position is not compiled.
B. Data Standards and Quality
The Republic of Congo participates in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) since
November 5, 2003. However, the metadata posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards
Bulletin Board (DSBB) has not been updated since 2003. No data ROSC is available.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITYANALYSIS

July 7. 2014

Approved By
Anne-Marie Gulde-Wolf
and Bob Traa (IMF)
and Jeffrey D. Lewis and
Marcelo Giugale (IDA)

The Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) has been prepared
jointly by IMF and World Bank staff, in consultation with the
authorities, using the debt sustainability framework for lowincome countries approved by the Boards of both
institutions.

This debt sustainability analysis (DSA) concludes that the Republic of Congo faces a low
risk of debt distress, similar to the analysis prepared in the previous year.8 Under the
baseline scenario for the current DSA all debt burden indicators are projected to remain
below the policy-dependent indicative thresholds. Standard stress tests result in one
breach of these thresholds which could give rise to a downgrade of Congo’s rating to
“moderate risk of debt distress”. This finding underscores the vulnerability of the
Congolese economy to external shocks, in particular, to adverse changes in oil prices and
external demand. However, in view of the Republic of Congo’s large government deposits
at the BEAC and gross official reserves at the BEAC, which gradually increase in the
medium-term under the baseline scenario, and which are a mitigating factor that could
help Congo weather potential adverse shocks, Congo is classified as at “low risk of debt
distress“. In order to increase the resilience of the Congolese economy, efforts should
continue to focus on diversification of the tradable sectors. Moreover, medium-and longterm fiscal and debt sustainability can be promoted through continued adherence to
prudent borrowing policies and building of fiscal buffers. Under an alternative policy
scenario, which assumes a continuation of large government spending over the medium
term, gross official reserves would quickly deteriorate and debt-burden indicators would
be more unfavorable. Under the alternative policy scenario debt vulnerabilities would be
significantly higher and entail a rating downgrade.”

8

This DSA is based on end-2013 debt data. The 2013 DSA (see IMF Country Report No. 13/282) was based on
end-2012 debt data. The fiscal year for the Republic of Congo is January–December.

REPUBLIC OF CONGO

BACKGROUND
1.
Congo’s stock of external debt has been building up since the extensive HIPC/MRDI
debt relief in 2010. As noted in the previous DSA, Congo reached the HIPC Initiative Completion
Point in January 2010. This resulted in estimated total debt service savings of US$1.9 billion, and a
decline in gross public external debt to just over 20 percent of GDP at end-2010 (from about
55 percent of GDP in 2009) (See Press Release No. 10/20, January 28, 2010). However, the external
debt stock at the end of 2013 amounted to around US$4.3 billion, up from US$2.4 billion in 2010.9
The debt-to-GDP ratio increased steadily over the past 3 years, reflecting new borrowing, notably
large disbursements under bilateral loan agreements with China, contracted in 2006 and 2012.
Bilateral creditors currently comprise nearly two-thirds of total debt (see Table 1). Domestic public
debt is relatively low at around 4 percent of GDP. The bulk of domestic arrears involve pension
arrears and unpaid social benefits which started accumulating after the liquidation of public
enterprises in the past as employees were not rightfully terminated.10

The sustainability of Congo’s debt should be assessed in the context of the country’s
sizeable financial assets. Gross official reserves stood at about 38 percent of GDP at end-2013. In
addition, the government holds substantial foreign currency deposits at China’s EXIM bank. As
depicted in Figure 1, the government’s large deposits at the BEAC are equivalent to about

This figure includes also the external arrears stock of US$739 million. More than ⅔ are related to commercial
creditors, for which legal decisions are pending. The rest is owed to bilateral creditors for which the provisions of
debt relief under the HIPC Initiative are still under discussion.

The authorities are currently undertaking an audit of domestic arrears. Once the audit is completed, the authorities
intend to put in place a multi-year repayment plan.

60 percent of external public debt and gross official reserves at the BEAC are equivalent to about
118 percent of external debt. The large gross official reserves and government deposits at the BEAC
reflect the ongoing run of high international oil prices since the achievement of HIPC/MDRI debt
relief in 2010. Assuming the government continues to save part of its annual oil revenues, Congo’s
gross official reserves will continue to exceed the level of public debt throughout the projection
horizon.11

Nonetheless, there is a need to strengthen public debt management. A recent IMF
public debt management technical assistance needs assessment mission highlighted the need to:
(i) strengthen the legal and institutional framework to cover the entire process of issuing and
managing debt; (ii) develop a medium-term debt management strategy and enhance transparency
in debt management; (iii) introduce a formal framework for managing the government's cash flows;
and (iv) strengthen the staff analytical capabilities with respect to managing the public debt.

UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS
4.
The medium and long-term macroeconomic framework underlying the DSA is
consistent with the baseline scenario presented in the Staff Report for 2014 Article IV
Consultation. The main assumptions and projections for key macroeconomic variables are
summarized in Box 1. Economic activity is expected to remain strong, largely driven by the non-oil
11

sector, reflecting developments in construction, agriculture and services. Oil production is foreseen
to gradually increase from 88 million barrels in 2013 to a peak of 118 million barrels in 2017 and
then decline in later years. Large capital expenditures are projected to continue in the medium term
to address the country’s infrastructure gap. Once a critical amount of public capital stock is reached,
corresponding to middle-income countries’ level, public investment is assumed to gradually decline
as private investment picks up, attracted by an improved infrastructure base and a friendlier
business climate.
5.
Assumptions regarding external borrowing have been adjusted compared to the
macroeconomic framework underpinning last year’s DSA (see Table 2). The projected debt
profile in last year’s DSA only reflected already committed loans. In this year’s DSA, the debt profile
is substantially higher as it also includes the authorities’ medium-term borrowing plans. The
Congolese authorities are projected to continue borrowing externally at broadly the same pace as in
the last three years. In line with these projections, new gross external borrowing over the medium
term (2014–19) is expected to total around US$3.3 billion. The terms of the new debt are assumed
to be highly concessional, in line with the agreement signed with China in 2012.12 The degree of
concessionality is assumed to lessen after 2025. Compared to previous DSAs, the grant element is
higher, mainly due to the assumed upward revision of the discount rate (from 3 to 5 percent).13
6.
Under the baseline, the current account balance is expected to be negative over 2014–
16, but it turns positive in later years. These developments are mainly driven by ambitious
infrastructure projects and new investments in the oil sector that result in an upward trend in
imports of goods and services. The Moho Nord deep offshore field, developed by Total jointly with
Chevron and SNPC, is expected to attract around $10 billion of foreign direct investments over
2013–16, and to come on stream in 2017 when Congolese oil production is expected to peak.
Considering the large uncertainty in the mining sector, a conservative approach is adopted; only one
of Congo’s iron ore projects under development is assumed to reach the production phase,
containing output growth. Removing existing sector-specific infrastructure bottlenecks in
transportation would provide a significant boost to longer-term growth at the cost of significant
initial investments. In the long run, as oil exports decline and non-oil export receipts fail to
compensate for this loss, additional financing would be needed. The present DSA assumes that the
financing gap after 2025 is filled on concessional terms, although with a lower grant element than
that under the current Chinese loans. 14

12

This assumption reflects the high level of deposit collateralization, which at this moment is estimated to be around
150 percent.
13

The 2014 DSA’s grant element of new public sector borrowing in the short and medium term is around 49 percent,
reflecting 5 years of grace period, 20 years maturity and very low interest rate on loans.
14

The grant element of new borrowing in the long term is assumed to be around 28 percent, mainly reflecting higher
interest rates.

REPUBLIC OF CONGO

Box 1. Republic of Congo: Main Macroeconomic Assumptions


Real GDP growth: The non-oil sector is projected to grow on average by 7 percent per year
during 2014–21 driven by construction, agriculture and public investment; non-oil growth would
stabilize at about 5 percent thereafter. Given the uncertainties surrounding the mining projects
(including sluggish global demand and the need for large investment in infrastructure) the
baseline projections for mining output are cautious. Iron ore production, which is expected to
start timidly in 2014 with 200,000 tons, is supposed to augment to 2 million tons in 2015, to
7 million tons by 2017, and to 17 million tons by 2023. These projections are conservative, since
the estimated potential of mining in Congo is more than 50 million tons per year if infrastructure
gaps are addressed.15



Oil production and prices: Annual oil production is projected at around 89 million barrels in
2014 and expected to peak at 118 million barrels in 2017. Based on official projections,
production would steadily decline over 2019–34, to about 13 million barrels in 2034. Following
projections in the IMF’s World Economic Outlook, international oil prices are projected to
decrease by about 3 percent per year during 2014–18; thereafter, they are assumed to remain
constant in real terms.



Inflation: Following the sharp acceleration to 7.5 percent (year-on-year) in 2012, inflation
decelerated to close to 2 percent at the end of 2013 in line with regional and international
trends. The appreciation of the CFA franc with respect to the U.S. dollar also helped to anchor
price stability. In the medium term, inflation is projected to stay below the CEMAC’s convergence
criteria of 3 percent.



Current account balance: Current account fluctuations are driven by the dynamics of exports
and imports in the oil and mining sectors. The balance is expected to be positive when oil
production peaks in 2017 and 2018; however, it would turn to a widening deficit thereafter as the
currently assumed mining production would not suffice to compensate for the decline in oil
production.



Fiscal balance: Following the budgeted sharp increase in public capital expenditures in 2014, the
baseline projections assume that fiscal consolidation resumes in 2015 and continues in the
medium- and long-term. The basic non-oil primary deficit would narrow from about 48.5 percent
of non-oil GDP in 2014 to 26.5 percent in 2019 and close to zero in the long run.



External financing: In the medium term, the authorities are assumed to continue to borrow
externally at similarly concessional terms. The second loan agreement with China worth
US$ 1 billion is assumed to be disbursed over the 2013–14 period. This is assumed to be
followed by additional borrowing over the period 2015–21 to the tune of another US$ 3.3 billion.
These disbursements would finance reconstruction efforts in the aftermath of the 2012
ammunitions depot explosions, contribute to address Congo’s infrastructure gap and help the
preparations of the 11th All-Africa Games organized in Brazzaville in 2015. In the long run,
external borrowing would be needed to ensure a minimum public investment of about 9 percent
of GDP. The concessionality level is expected to lessen after 2025.

15

Fluctuations in real GDP growth from 2018 onward mainly reflect fluctuations in oil production with the exception
of 2023 when mining production is expected to increase further.

7.
The macroeconomic outlook is subject to risks. The baseline scenario is built around
relatively favorable assumptions about commodity prices and the availability of new public sector
borrowing on concessional terms. Given the high reliance on oil revenues and exports, the
Congolese economy remains vulnerable to external shocks, notably to a fall in oil prices or a
slowdown of trade partners’ demand. However, the Republic of Congo has accumulated sufficient
fiscal and external reserves to mitigate the immediate effects of such shocks. Nevertheless, a
protracted worsening of the terms of trade or foreign demand could trigger severe imbalances and
require additional borrowing to avoid a sharp contraction in income. This could have negative
implications for debt sustainability.
8.
To illustrate the vulnerabilities facing Congo, a DSA under an “alternative policy
scenario” that assumes a continuation of current large spending is also prepared. The
important policy decisions facing the authorities are highlighted by a comparison of the baseline
scenario with the “alternative policy” scenario (see Table 8).

DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
G. External DSA
9.
Under the baseline, Congo’s debt indicators are below the relevant country-specific
debt burden thresholds. The joint Bank-Fund debt sustainability framework (DSF) for low-income
countries classifies Congo as a “weak” performer, based on the quality of the country’s policies and
institutions as measured by the 3-year average of the ratings under the World Bank’s Country Policy
and Institutional Assessment (CPIA). This is reflected in lower debt sustainability thresholds
compared to countries operating in a strong policy environment.16 Nevertheless, given the low level
of external debt and strengthening indicators of repayment capacity, the debt stock and debt
service ratios remain comfortably within the sustainable debt domain throughout the projections
period under the baseline.
10.
One of the stress tests breaches temporarily the indicative threshold. Standard bound
tests that examine the implications of various shocks to the debt and debt-service paths based on
the country’s historical volatility result in sharp increases in the debt burden indicators (Figure 2a).
For all indicators, except for the debt-service to revenue ratio, the most extreme scenario is
associated with a shock to exports. A decline in exports to a level equivalent to one standard
deviation below their historical average in the first two years of the projection period would cause
the PV of debt to GDP ratio to rise by about 14 percentage points and the PV of debt to export ratio
by 35 percentage points at the peak.17 This development results in a breach of the threshold in the
case of the PV of debt to GDP path during 2016–23. The breach of the threshold relates to increased
16
The thresholds for weak performers are 100, 30 and 200 percent for the PV of debt to exports, GDP and
government revenue, respectively. Debt service thresholds are 15 and 18 percent of exports and revenue,
respectively.
17

The vulnerability stems from the very high share of oil in Congo’s exports and the large volatility of oil prices and
production. The magnitude of the shock doubled to -10 percent in this exercise compared with last year’s DSA.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

oil export volatility in recent years that results in a doubling of the magnitude of the export shock
compared with the magnitude of the shock in last year’s DSA. While this breach of the policydependent threshold would give rise to a downgrade of Congo to a “moderate risk of debt distress,”
we consider that the higher volatility of the oil exports is temporary and is expected to be
compensated by a higher production in the medium term. In addition, Congo’s large external asset
position would help to buffer it from an adverse export shock. Under the historical scenario, which
derives the debt indicators assuming that key variables are at their 10-year historical averages, all
debt ratios decline very rapidly. However, as pointed out in the previous DSA, this scenario is less
relevant for resource-rich countries since past trends are likely to be a poor predictor of future
outcomes.

H. Public DSA
11.
Adding domestic public debt to external debt does not change the results of the
analysis (see Figure 3). Congo’s domestic public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) debt includes
domestic arrears. The evolution of the total public debt indicators broadly follows that of external
debt under the baseline. The most extreme shock (in this case real GDP growth in 2014-15 set at
one standard deviation below its historical average) raises the PV of debt to GDP ratio substantially
to over 50 percent in the outer years of the projections period, and stabilizes at this level. A
permanently lower GDP growth would have a similar, albeit somewhat smaller, effect on the debt
ratios. The accumulation of official foreign reserves, which in the case of Congo is significant due to
high primary surpluses, can be regarded as a buffer against these potential shocks.

I. External and Public DSA in an Alternative Policy Scenario
12.
External and Public DSAs were also ran for the case in which an “alternative policy”
scenario is used as the baseline. Under the alternative policy scenario, continued large government
capital spending together with further real appreciation from higher inflation would lead the current
account to register increasing deficits from 2015 onwards. As a result, reserves would fall to
5 months of imports by 2019—which is on the low side for a country with a highly concentrated
export basket and a pegged exchange rate, and the government would eventually need to borrow
more to finance its spending. As a result, the debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to exceed 50 percent
by 2020 and to top 66 percent by 2025. Under the alternative policy scenario, new loans would likely
be less concessional from 2020 onwards. Interest rates would rise to 5 percent, on average, and the
average grace period would shorten. Eventually, the rise in external debt would force the inevitable
downward adjustment in government spending, and growth would fall below the average growth
rates in the “strong policy” scenario.
13.
Under the alternative policy scenario, debt vulnerabilities would be significantly
higher and may entail a rating downgrade.” Figure 2b illustrates that the PV of the debt-to-GDP
ratio would generally remain above the indicative threshold of 40 percent from 2019 onward.
Moreover, the PV of debt-to-exports ratio would breach the threshold from 2021 onwards and the
debt service-to-exports ratio would reach the threshold in 2030.

AUTHORITIES VIEW
14.
The Republic of Congo’s authorities broadly concurred with the overall assessment of
low risk of debt distress, highlighting the strong net external position that would provide a
buffer against adverse shocks. The authorities reiterated that they do not want to repeat the
experience from the beginning of the 2000s, when debt exceeded by far the CEMAC convergence
criteria. They assured staff of their plans to continue to borrow only under highly concessional
terms. Finally, the authorities are aware of the risks related to oil prices and exports and their
strategy is to continue the economic diversification.

Box 2. Macroeconomic Assumptions: Strong vs. Alternative Policy Scenario
1.
Under the baseline “strong policy” scenario, the authorities undertake fiscal consolidation
and build up their fiscal and external buffers in the medium to long term. Under this “strong policy”
scenario, the government implements a fiscal consolidation, with government spending remaining
broadly flat in nominal terms over the period 2014–19. Growth continues on average at a healthy clip in
the medium to long-term, even in the face of a contraction in the oil sector. Inflation remains moderate.
The current account is a deficit of one percent on average over 2014–19, slipping into an average deficit
of 2 percent over the medium to long-term. Gross official reserves average 10 months of prospective
imports of goods and services over 2014–19, and coverage is expected to remain above that ino the
longer-term. The initial fiscal consolidation frees up fiscal space for higher average expenditure growth
over 2027–34 (Table 8, “Baseline”).
2.
The alternative policy scenario illustrates the risks of continued large government
spending. In this scenario, government spending increases unchecked to a peak of 105 percent of GDP in
2018. As a result, overall growth would on average be higher than in the strong policy scenario over the
period 2014–19, yet already in the period 2020–26 growth would dip below that of the baseline. (Table 8,
“Alternative Policy”).
3.
However, the short term boost to growth comes at a significant longer-term cost. Higher
imports cause the current account to deteriorate significantly over the period 2020–26, with the deficit
remaining on average wider than in the strong policy scenario. Higher government spending also pushes
up inflation compared to the baseline scenario, eroding competitiveness. Gross official reserves fall below
external public debt. A sharp correction in government spending is required to correct the imbalances.
4.

The keys assumptions underlying the alternative policy scenario are as follows:



Congo is assumed to maintain a minimum level of official foreign reserves equal to 5 months of imports.



In the face of declining oil revenues and continued large government spending, it is assumed that capital
expenditures are financed by first running down deposits in China. Following this, the government increases
external borrowing to sustain higher government spending than in the baseline. As a result, the debt-to-GDP
ratio is projected to exceed 50 percent by 2021 and to top 66 percent by 2025. Under the alternative policy
scenario, new loans would likely be less concessional from 2020 onwards. Interest rates would rise to
5 percent, on average, and the average grace period would shorten. Eventually, the rise in external debt
would force the inevitable downward adjustment in government spending.



The longer-term effect of postponing the fiscal consolidation is to run up unsustainable external liabilities,
leaving no financial assets to provide a permanent income once oil reserves are exhausted.

REPUBLIC OF CONGO

CONCLUSION
13.
In the Staff’s view, the Republic of Congo continues to face a low risk of debt distress,
but with the potential of a negative revision in the future if external vulnerabilities
deteriorate. All external debt indicators are well below the country-specific indicative thresholds
under the baseline “strong policy” scenario but one of these thresholds is temporarily breached
under the various standard stress tests. Nevertheless, Congo is unlikely to resort to extensive
external borrowing in the near future given the comfortable level of reserves. It is therefore
important for the government to anchor macroeconomic policies by a stability-oriented mediumterm fiscal framework that targets a gradual reduction of the non-oil primary fiscal deficit and to
save some oil revenue to prepare for the post-oil era.18 The pattern seen in the last 3 years with
respect to external borrowing underscores the constrained capacity to finance large infrastructure
projects. Since we expect this trend to continue, new borrowing contracts should reflect similar
concessional terms as the recent ones in order to maintain debt sustainability. In a “alternativepolicy” scenario, which illustrates the risks of persistent delays in putting the non-oil primary deficit
on a medium-term consolidation path, vulnerabilities would increase and the Republic of Congo
would need to be reclassified to being at a ”high risk of debt distress.”
14.
Improving competitiveness and promoting economic diversification are key to
increasing resilience to exogenous shocks. As the DSA indicates, Congo’s debt ratios appear to be
most sensitive to swings in exports. Given the high concentration and vulnerability of the economy
to downward movements in oil prices, broadening of the economic base by enhancing the
development of the non-oil sector would reduce the volatility of exports and would strengthen the
debt service capacity of the Congolese economy. In this regard, efforts toward improving the
business climate with assistance from the World Bank should help strengthen competitiveness and
boost growth. In the same vein, in addressing Congo’s weak physical and human capital, priority
should be given to making electricity supply more reliable and competitive, and to enhancing the
quality of transportation services and of the labor force.
15.
Focusing on policies to strengthen public debt management and institutions could
enhance the Congolese authorities’ capacity to manage debt and fiscal policies. In the DSA
framework, this would raise the Congolese economies’ debt-carrying capacity, by raising the
country’s CPIA rating. Moreover the development and integration of the regional debt market within
the CEMAC area would broaden the menu of options to manage the Republic of Congo’s financing
needs.

18

Although gross official reserves declined in the past two years, the government accumulated savings overseas.

2/

Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.

3/

Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate ch

4/

Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.

5/

Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.

6/

Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.

7/

Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.

8/

Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly a

an offsetting adjustment in import levels).

Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
July 25, 2014

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes Article IV Consultation with the
Republic of Congo
On July 21, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with the Republic of Congo.1
Recent economic developments in the Republic of Congo have been favorable. Growth in the
last 5 years has averaged about 5 percent per year, higher than in regional peers. Gross oil
revenue averaged more than US$8 billion per year in 2012 and 2013, equivalent to about
60 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Substantial fiscal savings have been set aside by
virtue of the ongoing run of high international oil prices. However, poverty remains
comparatively high, despite robust economic growth and large government spending. The
poverty rate amounted to 46.5 percent in 2011 compared with 50.7 percent in 2005.
The overall fiscal surplus in 2013 remained sizable at 5.8 percent of GDP (13.9 percent of nonoil GDP) reflecting sizable oil revenues from high oil prices and increases in non-oil revenues.
Public investment spending and arrears payments for social benefits and payments to suppliers
pushed total cash government spending to about CFAF 2,735 billion in 2013, about 5 percent
above the 2012 level when spending was raised in the aftermath of the Mpila ammunitions
explosion, and up from CFAF 1,865 billion in 2011. External public debt has continued to trend
upward, reaching 32 percent of GDP in 2013, up from 20 percent of GDP in 2010, when the
Republic of Congo obtained debt relief through the Highly Indebted Poor Countries Initiative
(HIPC) and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI). Most of Congo’s borrowing is on
concessional terms from China and is targeted at financing key infrastructure projects. Despite
declining for the second year in a row, the Republic of Congo’s reserves at the Banque des Etats
de l’Afrique Centrale (BEAC) continue to cover about 7 months of prospective imports of goods
and services.
The country’s medium-term prospects are promising provided that progress is made with
structural reforms and fiscal adjustment. The economy is projected to expand by about 6 percent
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A
staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country's economic
developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board.

per annum between 2014 and 2019, as a result of increases in oil production and the start of iron
ore production. Inflation is easing, aided by lower food prices and real appreciation of the
CFA franc. The government budget relies heavily on oil revenue. Therefore, oil price volatility
and the exhaustibility of oil reserves could pose risks to macroeconomic stability and the
authorities’ objective of attaining sustained high inclusive non-oil growth over the medium term.
Other key risks to the economic outlook relate to a decline in oil prices associated with slower
growth in advanced economies and major emerging markets, as well as social tensions arising
from inequality and poor job opportunities.
Executive Board Assessment2
Directors commended the authorities for the overall good economic performance, including
strong growth and low inflation. Directors noted that the medium-term economic outlook is
favorable, underpinned by new mining production and the government’s ambitious investment
program. They emphasized, however, that prudent policies and rigorous implementation of
reforms will be critical to meet the country’s social and development needs, reduce poverty and
unemployment, and boost non-oil growth, while ensuring macroeconomic stability.
Directors emphasized the need to contain the growth of government spending and recommended
fiscal consolidation over the medium term to safeguard fiscal sustainability. They encouraged
the authorities to strengthen the fiscal framework by adopting the non-oil primary balance as a
fiscal anchor to insulate spending from the volatile and exhaustible nature of oil revenues.
Directors agreed that broadening the tax base and reducing exemptions will also strengthen the
fiscal position.
Directors supported the public investment program, aimed at improving infrastructure,
diversifying the economy, and boosting employment. They stressed that increasing the
efficiency of government investment will be key to achieving this goal. Directors underscored
the need to strengthen public financial management to improve accountability, governance, and
the quality of public spending. In this context, they called for expeditious enactment of the
Fiscal Responsibility and Transparency law.
Directors noted the Republic of Congo’s low risk of debt distress. To preserve debt
sustainability, they advised the authorities to continue to strengthen public debt management,
particularly by developing a medium-term debt strategy and enhancing transparency.
To further promote the non-oil sector, Directors stressed the importance of structural reforms to
strengthen the business climate, enhance financial development and increase access to finance

by strengthening legal and informational systems. They recommended a careful analysis of the
implications of recently introduced fiscal incentives for special economic zones. Directors also
highlighted that programs designed to strengthen the education system and implement social
spending to the poor should be well-targeted, evaluated and monitored to ensure their
effectiveness.
Directors encouraged the authorities to fully comply with the regional CEMAC (Economic and
Monetary Community of Central Africa) obligations. They welcomed the authorities’ support
for the ongoing review of the CEMAC’s reserves pooling framework and stressed that the
planned establishment of a sovereign wealth fund, investing in higher yielding assets, should be
consistent with the regional reserves pooling architecture.

Statement by Mr. Assimaidou and Mr. Sembene on the Republic of Congo
July 21, 2014
Introduction
The economic situation has remained sound in Congo in recent years as described in the staff
report, with growth being strong, inflation kept in check, and international reserves maintained
at a healthy level. At the same time, the country has remained among the top growth performers
in the region while its sovereign credit ratings compares favorably with its peers. A number of
human development indicators have also improved during the past decade according to the
UNDP. However, while prospects for further improvements in economic performance and social
welfare are strong, they are constrained by fierce infrastructure bottlenecks, high unemployment
and inequality, and daunting institutional capacity constraints facing the country.
To meet these challenges, my Congolese authorities have continued to spare no efforts to
improve job opportunities and alleviate poverty, notably by implementing reforms to make the
economy more diversified and competitive, promoting inclusive non-oil growth, and expanding
social protection schemes. In particular, these efforts have included steps to expand the social
safety net, set up special economic zones, improve the business climate, and increase the supply
of skilled labor. Going forward, they expect these endeavors to be facilitated by the surge in
economic activity that will result from favorable oil production prospects. Similarly, their
ambitious public investment program aimed at upgrading the country’s basic infrastructure
bodes well for the economic outlook, through its positive effects on economic diversification
and competitiveness. The ambitious reform agenda they have developed with IFC assistance to
improve the business climate will also stimulate non-oil growth.
Recent Fiscal Developments and Policy Framework
Congo’s fiscal performance remains strong. In 2013 the overall fiscal surplus in percent of GDP
is estimated to have increased further while the non-oil primary deficit in percent of GDP
declined significantly compared to their 2012 levels. On the revenue front, strong non-oil tax
revenue mobilization triggered by customs and tax administration reforms helped to partly offset
the adverse impact of lower-than-expected oil revenues and spending pressures on the overall
fiscal balance. Performance on the expenditure side was broadly kept in line with the budget
although capital spending overruns were noted emanating from the ongoing preparation of the
All-Africa Games which is a continental multi-sport event to be held next year in Brazzaville.
That this positive fiscal outturn was secured amid a significant decline in oil revenues reflects in
particular the steps taken to reduce domestically-financed capital spending.
While spending pressures may continue to build up this year in the run up to the 2015 edition of
the All Africa Games, the authorities stand ready to take necessary actions to contain them and
to mitigate inherent fiscal risks. Moreover, staff’s call for formalizing revisions to fiscal targets
is consistent with the authorities’ stated readiness to prepare a supplementary budget, if
warranted.
The authorities acknowledge the need to strengthen their fiscal policy framework, notably
through the continued implementation of a fiscal rule. The fiscal rule that was introduced last
year was deemed inadequate, partly because it targeted predetermined absolute levels of

2

spending and savings amid the uncertain outlook for oil revenue. Going forward, the authorities
intend to revise the rule by moving away from an absolute split of oil revenues between public
spending and savings. To this end, they plan to formulate a new fiscal rule on the basis of a
review of international best practices in resource-rich countries, taking into account the
country’s specific circumstances. In this process, staff’s call for anchoring fiscal policy to the
non-oil primary balance will be given due attention. It is also the authorities’ intention to
continue to work on a medium-term budget framework, in line with staff’s recommendation.
While the authorities recognize the importance of placing non-oil fiscal deficit on a gradually
declining path, they reckon that progress toward this goal will have to be balanced against the
need to address the critical infrastructure investment needs facing the country at this juncture.
Given the high incidence of poverty, they will also continue to attach high priority to boosting
social expenditures, consistent with recent efforts to expand social protection schemes,
implement school nutrition programs, and deliver technical and vocational training.
Fiscal Transparency and Public Financial Management
The authorities continue to take steps to strengthen financial transparency. This is notably
illustrated by the preparation of the draft fiscal responsibility and transparency law as well as
their ongoing work to ensure Congo’s full compliance with CEMAC directives on public
financial management. Congo’s “compliant country” status under the Extractive Industry
Transparency Initiative (EITI) also speaks of the authorities’ resolve. As such, the country
submits regular EITI reports that fully disclose revenues mobilized from the extraction of its
natural resources.
The authorities are also taking additional measures to improve public financial management. To
this end, they will continue to team up with the country’s development partners, notably the
World Bank and the European Union in the context of the Public Expenditure Management and
Financial Accountability Review. The Fund is also called upon to support the initiatives taken
by the authorities to strengthen public financial management, including by providing technical
assistance in the finalization of the fiscal responsibility and transparency law. Furthermore, an
audit of domestic arrears has been commissioned and, upon its completion, prompt steps will be
taken to develop a multi-year payment plan.
Public Debt Management and Policy Coordination
The authorities remain strongly committed to prudent public debt management. Although the
country’s positive sovereign credit ratings would guarantee easy access to international capital
markets, they have expressed their continued preference for concessional financing in order to
preserve sound debt burden indicators. In order to implement critical infrastructure projects, the
Congolese authorities have continued to borrow from China on concessional terms on the basis
of their 2006 strategic partnership agreement. Thanks to the authorities’ prudent approach to
debt management, the country’s risk of debt distress remains low.
The authorities are determined to sustain their efforts to enhance policy coordination, as
recommended by staff. In this regard, they take note of staff’s renewed call for the reinstitution
of a high-level policy coordination committee. However, it is their view that improved policy
coordination would more likely be secured by improving the efficiency of the existing
institutions rather than reinstating the high-level policy coordination committee or establishing

3

new committees. In the country’s current context, they believe that the proliferation of public
entities does not necessarily help to improve policy coordination, but is likely to create more
acute governance problems.
Financial Sector Reforms and Public Assets Management
Congo’s financial sector indicators remain broadly sound. Close supervision and regulation of
the sector that are conducted at the regional level have contributed to adequate compliance with
prudential ratios, as underscored in the staff report. Beyond the significant financial stability
gains that were secured over the past few decades, they see scope for making inroads into
financial development. While the rapid expansion of microfinance institutions significantly
contributed to improving financial inclusion, access to financial services remains limited for
many small- and medium enterprises and low-income households. In this connection, the
Congolese authorities will keep working closely with BEAC and regional authorities to take
necessary actions to promote financial development, while preserving financial stability by
strengthening the supervisory and regulatory framework.
The authorities look forward to the conclusions of the working group tasked with reviewing the
CEMAC’s reserves pooling framework. Pending completion of this ongoing work, they will
take necessary actions to optimize returns to the country’s foreign assets. In this connection, it is
also their intention to establish a sovereign wealth fund (SWF) that will invest part of savings
from oil revenue in foreign asset acquisitions. A law enabling the creation of such a SWF has
been adopted by the Parliament. It is envisaged that the SWF will be established at the BEAC
and will acquire mostly risk-free foreign assets.
In conclusion, I would like to convey my authorities’ appreciation of the productive policy
discussions they continue to hold with Fund staff. The informative staff report and Selected
Issues Paper will be valuable in their quest for sound policymaking and improved economic
performance. Looking ahead, they look forward to benefiting from continued Fund’s policy
advice and technical assistance, particularly in the area of national account and government
finance statistics. They would also like to express their appreciation to the Board and
management for their continued support.
