EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background: The global downturn had only a mild impact as growth was supported by still
strong terms of trade, a financial sector insulated from global capital markets, and an increase
in public expenditure. Growth will rebound in 2010 as construction begins on two liquefied
natural gas (LNG) projects. Although inflation declined in 2009, it is expected to accelerate
in 2010 as imported inflation rises and domestic demand butts up against capacity
constraints.
Main issues: The near-term challenge is to maintain macroeconomic stability in the face of a
substantial demand shock from the construction of two major LNG projects. In the medium
term, the priority is to ensure that windfall revenues from exhaustible resources are used
effectively to raise living standards on a sustainable basis.
Staff views: Staff endorsed the withdrawal of fiscal stimulus in the 2010 Budget but raised
concerns about the planned level of investment spending and slippages in the implementation
of the Medium-Term Fiscal Strategy. Staff advised that the integration of a sovereign wealth
fund into the macro framework could prove to be a more effective means to manage windfall
resource revenue than the current practice of using trust accounts managed outside the budget
process. Staff stressed that monetary policy needed to be focused on emerging inflation
pressures and act preemptively to avoid high inflation becoming entrenched in expectations.
Further, staff called for better coordination of monetary and fiscal policy.
Authorities’ views: The authorities agreed on the key issues and the broad policy advice but
pointed to a numbers of challenges in implementation. On fiscal policy, they noted that the
magnitude of the deviation from the framework in 2009 reflected the significant acceleration
in spending following the easing of constraints on trust account spending and international
endorsement of fiscal stimulus. The authorities also noted that the absence of an informed
public debate undermined incentives for Ministers to adhere to the fiscal framework. More
encouragingly, they indicated that there would be scope to delay some planned public
investment expenditure and they established a working group to develop a proposal for the
introduction of a sovereign wealth fund to manage resource revenue. On monetary policy,
they appeared somewhat resigned to accept higher inflation. In part this reflected the central
bank’s concern about the impact on its capital of using both the policy rate and bank bills to
contain liquidity and thus domestic demand.

I. MACROECONOMIC BACKDROP
A. Context
1.
The global financial crisis had only a mild impact on Papua New Guinea, but
improving living standards remains a challenge. Prior to the global downturn, moderate
economic growth was generated by buoyant commodity export revenues and effective
macroeconomic policy implementation. During the downturn, growth in Papua New Guinea
was supported by an insulated financial sector, still strong terms of trade, and a sound fiscal
position that allowed for an increase in public expenditure. However, GDP per capita
remains low and improvements in living standards have lagged those in other regional lowincome countries. The challenge is to improve the environment for nonmineral-sector
investment which remains unattractive due to high crime and weak infrastructure and
governance. LNG revenue will provide an opportunity to address long-term challenges and
significantly raise living standards; however, unless managed properly it will also raise the
economy’s vulnerability to swings in commodity prices.

B. Current Economic Setting
2.
Growth eased modestly and inflation fell in 2009. After expanding by almost
7 percent in 2008, GDP is estimated to have grown by just under 5 percent in 2009. While
the mineral sector contracted slightly due to production delays and depletion of oil reserves,
nonmineral sector growth remained buoyant. Continued expansion in domestic credit, still
strong export incomes (as export demand held up relatively well), an increase in public
expenditure, and the positive confidence effects of the LNG projects all helped support
domestic demand. After peaking above 13 percent in the third quarter of 2008, CPI inflation
fell steadily to under 6 percent at end-2009. The improved inflation performance primarily
reflects moderation in food price inflation and a decline in energy prices. However, nontradable inflation pressures appear to have intensified.

Following several years of surpluses, the fiscal balance shifted into a large deficit
in 2009. During the period of rising commodity prices, windfall revenues were largely saved
and public debt reduced. In addition to funding debt reduction, windfall revenues were also
accumulated in public trust accounts to address development needs. In 2008, the government
relaxed constraints on trust account spending and spending from trusts exploded in 2009.
Trust spending was the main factor shifting the fiscal balance from a surplus of 2.5 percent of
GDP in 2008 to a deficit of almost 8 percent of GDP in 2009. The result was a fiscal impulse
of almost 13 percent of GDP.

The tight monetary policy stance in place since mid-2008 was eased slightly at
end-2009. The run-up in inflation over the course of 2008 prompted an increase in the
policy rate from 6 to 8 percent. In addition, the Bank of Papua New Guinea (BPNG) relied
heavily on bank bills to contain banking system liquidity, which expanded partly because of
government trust account. Both the BPNG’s liquidity control measures and declining
inflation contributed to a rise in real bank lending rates in late-2008 and 2009. Consequently,
credit growth eased from the high rates posted in 2007 and 2008. The BPNG lowered the
policy rate by 100 basis points in December 2009.

The financial sector has been a source of strength. The three large banks are
primarily deposit funded with no significant links to global capital markets. Balance sheets
are liquid with most lending going to the business sector. Although non-performing loans
rose to 0.8 percent of total assets from a trough of 0.4 percent, provisioning is high and banks
remain profitable. The other major financial institutions, pension funds, are also performing
well, although profitability has suffered given lower returns from some investments.

Although volatile during the period of global market instability, effective
exchange rates have returned close to averages over the previous 5 years. Prior to the
global crisis, exchange rate stability and rising commodity prices delivered a sequence of
current account surpluses and declines in external debt. However, owing partly to lower
commodity prices, the current account shifted into deficit in 2009. After appreciating in
2008, primarily against the Australian dollar, the currency depreciated by 12 percent in
nominal effective terms in 2009. This depreciation was the main factor driving the small
increase in external debt to 27 percent of GDP at end-2009. Reserves, which declined slightly
over the last half of 2008, were rebuilt during 2009 and now cover almost 12 months of nonmining imports. Foreign direct investment inflows, associated with ongoing mineral sector
projects, provided foreign currency to bolster reserve accumulation.

Furthermore, domestic demand was supported
by the confidence effects from the proposed LNG projects and increased public expenditure enabled
by the prudent fiscal policies of the preceding years. However, the associated decline in commodity
prices took its toll on the external and fiscal positions of the resource rich economy.

II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
7.
The near-term challenge will be to maintain macroeconomic stability during the
construction phase of the LNG projects. In the medium term, the priority is to ensure that
windfall revenues from exhaustible resources are used effectively to raise living standards,
while reducing the economy’s vulnerability to commodity price drops. Accordingly,
discussion focused on:


guarding against a resurgence in high inflation;



strengthening the implementation of the fiscal strategy; and



incorporating a sovereign wealth fund into the macroeconomic framework.
A. Outlook—Expansion with Upside Risks

8.
There was agreement that growth and inflation would accelerate. Both staff and
the authorities saw GDP growth rebounding to roughly 8 percent in 2010. Continued buoyant
commodity export demand and the LNG construction phase are expected to stimulate growth
and strain domestic capacity. Domestic demand pressures combined with the recovery in
international commodity prices and the depreciation of the kina against the Australian dollar
in 2009 were seen to fuel a pickup in inflation in 2010. Although, growth was expected to
slow somewhat in 2011 this was largely due to resource depletion and domestic capacity in
the nonmineral sector was expected to remain strained. Given this, staff saw a greater risk
than the authorities that high inflation could become entrenched in expectations. Although
the current account deficit was forecast to widen over the next few years with LNG related
imports, it was expected to be financed with foreign direct investment.
9.
Staff and the authorities saw risks skewed to the upside. Although a weaker than
expected recovery in the world economy presented some downside risk, overall the risks
were seen as tilted to the upside on both activity and inflation. It was recognized that the
direct and indirect impacts from the LNG construction phase could be larger than expected
and public spending, particularly from trust accounts held outside the budget, could add more
demand and inflation pressures than forecast in 2010.
B. Fiscal Policy—Strengthening Implementation
10.
Staff commended the authorities for the period of adherence to the MediumTerm Fiscal Strategy (MTFS), but raised concerns about the slippages in 2009. During
the commodity price boom, adherence to the MTFS (Box 2) resulted in fiscal surpluses,
declining public debt, and the accumulation of public resources in trust accounts. However,
in 2009, roughly 8 percent of GDP was spent from trust accounts, twice the amount allowed
under the MTFS. Staff stressed that adherence to the MTFS was required to provide a
credible fiscal anchor, maintain macroeconomic stability, and ensure that development

12
objectives were achieved. The authorities indicated that trust account spending in 2009
exceeded their expectation. While acknowledging that a relaxation of constraints on trust
spending was a factor, they noted that the international endorsement of fiscal stimulus
encouraged Ministers to accelerate trust spending. The authorities did point out that at least
the spending was from accumulated savings and not debt financed.
BOX 2. THE MEDIUM-TERM FISCAL STRATEGY
In July 2008, the Government approved a MTFS for the period 2008–12. Under this
strategy, the nonmineral fiscal deficit is constrained to fall within a range of 4 to 8 percent of
GDP. This range has been chosen based on the following principles:


Ongoing spending (including recurrent and development spending) should be kept in
line with “normal revenues”. Normal revenues are defined as the sum of nonmineral
revenues and normal mineral revenues—the mineral revenues that would be expected
without a commodity-price boom, about 4 percent of GDP. Ongoing spending is
limited to the sum of normal mineral revenues and nonmineral revenues.



Mineral revenues above 4 percent of GDP should be used for “one-off” expenditures,
debt reduction (30 percent) and additional public investment (70 percent). Amounts
not used for debt reduction accumulate in trust accounts to be drawn down over time.
In any year, no more that 4 percent of GDP can be spent from the trust accounts on
additional public investment.

The estimate of normal mineral revenues is based on the average from the pre-boom years of
1999–2003 and the expected performance in 2010–12 based on planned production and IMF
commodity price forecasts. Every two years, the government will reassess the
appropriateness of the 4 percent of GDP estimate of normal mineral revenues.
11.
Staff endorsed the 2010 Budget target of balance, but raised a number of
concerns. Targeting a balanced budget and thereby withdrawing the large stimulus in place
in 2009 was acknowledged as appropriate. However, staff noted that additional spending was
likely from trust accounts held outside the budget. Staff’s projection, which forecasts some
under spending from the development budget but assumes that half of the remaining trust
fund balances are spent in 2010, contains a fiscal deficit of roughly 1 percent of GDP.
Consequently, staff discussed the possibility of delaying some planned infrastructure
spending. Staff reasoned that public infrastructure spending could butt up against capacity
constraints, drive up prices, and yield poor value. Domestic capacity will be largely
exhausted by the LNG projects and construction sector capacity is unlikely to be forthcoming
from Australia because it is being absorbed by the demands from the resource sector and
public infrastructure projects. The authorities stressed that achieving Ministers’ agreement on
a balanced budget for 2010 had been an enormous challenge. However, they noted that a
large portion of the spending increase was in the development budget where there was
flexibility for delay and they would consider staff’s suggestion. Staff also noted that the 2010

13
Budget undermined fiscal credibility by directing all above-normal mineral revenue to public
investment (according to the MTFS, 30 percent should have been for debt reduction) and
failing to fully fund the government’s pension obligations as legislated.
12.
Discussion of mechanism to strengthen the implementation of the MTFS yielded
few tangible suggestions. Staff suggested that the authorities consider mechanisms used in
other countries, such as including MTFS rules in the Fiscal Responsibility Legislation or
compelling the Treasurer to explain to Parliament why budgets deviated from the MTFS, to
strengthen implementation. The authorities were not convinced that such mechanisms would
be effective. There was general agreement that there needed to be an underlying political will
to build a reputation for maintaining a credible fiscal framework. The authorities lamented
the absence of an informed public debate which meant that reputation effects could provide
little incentive for Ministers to adhere to the MTFS.
13.
There was agreement that public liability risks would increase during the LNG
construction phase. The government has taken on significant liabilities associated with the
landowner agreements that have not yet been funded and landowner demands could
increase.1 Because the government has taken on a completion guarantee for one of the
projects, it has an incentive to meet landowner demands. As a buffer against these liabilities,
staff suggested that public savings should increase. Given uncertainty regarding commodity
prices and production, staff recommended that when the MTFS normal mineral revenue
assumption came up for review this year, that it be reduced to 3 percent of GDP from
4 percent. This would reduce the nonmineral deficit, related to ongoing-spending, to
3 percent of GDP, a level that staff sees as sustainable until LNG project revenues are
realized. This would reduce the overall fiscal spending envelope, which would help ease
demand pressures at a time when private spending is expected to be strong. The increased
savings could then be used to address LNG related liabilities. The authorities indicated that
the suggestion would be considered.
14.
There was considerable discussion of a Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF) to
augment the macro framework to help manage resource revenue. With the LNG projects
expected to eventually deliver a large increase in public revenue, the authorities were
interested in the advantages of establishing an SWF. Staff provided an assessment of what
type of SWF would best address their needs (Box 3). Staff agreed to work closely with a
joint Treasury/BPNG working group tasked with preparing an SWF proposal for the National
Executive Council by end-June 2010. Staff noted that an SWF properly incorporated into
their framework would provide a more effective vehicle for saving windfall resource revenue
than the current practice of using trust accounts and that they need not wait for LNG revenue
to establish one.
1

Currently the unfunded liabilities associated with the landowner agreements represent about 8 percent of GDP.

14
BOX 3. LESSONS FROM INTERNATIONAL EXPERIENCE WITH SWFS1
Natural resource revenues pose macroeconomic management challenges. In particular,
the new LNG projects will bring substantial windfall revenues, which are volatile, uncertain,
exhaustible, and could lead to Dutch disease. Consequently, smoothing government
expenditure and decoupling it from the short-term volatility of natural resource revenues is a
challenge. Against this background, PNG may find it helpful to incorporate an SWF within a
sound fiscal policy framework.
A financing fund, featuring both stabilization and saving objectives, would serve best. A
financing fund would be directly linked to the budget’s non-mineral deficit and integrated
within the budget process, providing an explicit and transparent link between fiscal policy
and asset accumulation. Extrabudgetary spending, revenue earmarking, and rigid SWF’s
operational rules should be avoided. Importantly, an SWF must be well integrated in the
overall macroeconomic framework, which will likely need to be redesigned in light of the
magnitude of expected LNG revenues.
Accumulated resources should be invested abroad with stringent transparency and
accountability provisions. Investing abroad could avoid imparting volatility to the domestic
economy and help minimize Dutch disease. Transparent rules, disclosure of information
about fund financial assets, and clearly specified roles in the authority for managing financial
assets are also important aspects and should be in line with international best practice,
summarized in IMF and OECD guidelines.

C. Monetary Policy—The Appropriate Degree of Tightness
15.
The authorities agreed with staff assessment of the inflation outlook, but were
more sanguine than staff about the need to contain pressures. Staff noted that although
real interest rates had risen with the decline in inflation and credit growth had slowed,
inflation was still forecasted to rise notably. Staff pointed out that unlike the recent episode
of high inflation that was driven by food and energy prices, the projected increase in inflation
had a large domestic demand component, increasing the risk of high inflation becoming
entrenched in expectations. Staff reasoned that containing this type of inflation early would
reduce the net output cost relative to reducing it once entrenched. While agreeing with staff
about the likely pickup in inflation, the authorities noted that their ability to act preemptively
was impaired. They expressed concern that using both the policy rate and central bank bills
to contain credit growth and domestic demand risked undermining their capital base and thus
their credibility. In part this reflected the BPNG’s recent experience using bank bills to
remove excess market liquidity partially generated by government trust deposits.

15
16.
Given the experience with government trust accounts, there was agreement that
monetary and fiscal policy needed to be better coordinated. In 2009, bank bills yielding
between 6 and 7 percent were used to mop up liquidity in the system from trust deposits
yielding returns to the government between ½ to 1 percent. This resulted in a large net loss
for the public sector. Previously staff had advised that government trust accounts be held at
the central bank and although some attempts over the course of 2009 were made to execute
this, no progress was made. The authorities agreed that it would be preferable to transfer
remaining trust accounts to the BPNG and hold future above-normal mineral revenue at the
central bank. Further, the authorities saw merit in staff’s suggestion that the Treasury and the
BPNG work together to determine how much above-normal mineral revenue could be spent
each year based on the capacity constraints in the economy.
D. Financial Sector—Maintaining Stability
17.
There was agreement that the financial sector remained sound. The only sign of
stress from the global turmoil was a doubling of non-performing loans. However, because
this was from a low base and loan-loss provisions were substantial, capital buffers remain
large. Further, it was noted that a significant portion of the increase was from a single loan at
one of the banks and expectations were that the net loss was likely to be quite small.
18.
Maintaining asset quality was seen by staff and the authorities as the key
challenge. It was noted that during the financial crisis, banks had tightened lending
standards, shortening loan maturity. With local companies’ credit demand likely to increase
to take advantage of opportunities afforded by the LNG projects, there was agreement that
lending standards could ease. There was an expectation of a property-price boom in the
capital region from the increase in LNG associated demand given relatively inelastic supply
owing to land-availability constraints. In fact, anecdotal evidence suggested that it was under
way. Because of limited domestic investment opportunities, there was agreement that
overexposure to an inflated property market was a risk for financial institutions. The
authorities indicated that prudential guidelines constrained financial institutions’ property
market exposures and they recognized the need to monitor and enforce these closely.2
19.
The authorities indicated that the Bank of South Pacific (BSP) would operate
recently-purchased Colonial Bank of Fiji (CBF) as a branch. The BPNG had reached an
agreement with the Fijian authorities to receive adequate information to effectively supervise
the branch. It was noted that CBF was profitable, but with a lower rate of return than BSP
was earning.

Papua New Guinea will have its first Financial Sector Assessment Program during May 2010. Staff will await
the outcome to make detailed recommendations on regulatory and supervisory issues.

16
E. The Equilibrium Exchange Rate and External Stability
20.
Staff estimates suggest that the exchange rate is broadly in line with
fundamentals. Since last year’s assessment of mild overvaluation, depreciation in the Kina
and a projected improvement in the terms of trade have brought the currency back in line
with fundamentals (Box 4)
21.
A large projected widening in the current account deficit is not expected to
undermine external stability, but stress tests indicate a moderate risk of debt distress.
Because they are associated with the LNG projects, the large projected current account
deficits are expected to be FDI financed. Consequently, public external debt is anticipated to
increase only mildly and reflect concessional borrowing from international institutions.
However, under the most extreme stress tests, the debt sustainability analysis (Appendix 1)
indicates a moderate risk of debt distress with threshold levels being violated for the present
value of debt relative to GDP. Further, with the government’s LNG completion guarantee
and commitments to landowners, the risk of unfavorable medium-term debt dynamics has
increased. Staff stressed that fiscal discipline needs to be enhanced to maintain external debt
sustainability during the LNG construction period.
F. Fostering Sustainable Broad-Based Growth
22.
Structural reform implementation has slowed. The new Development Strategic
Plan (DSP) 2010-2030 correctly recognizes the need to shift the sources of growth to the
private nonmineral sector. The strategy stresses that to increase the exports of nonminerals
and manufactures, improvements are required in transportation, private micro-credit
facilities, basic utilities, human capital, and law and order. However, decisive actions have
been lacking with the exception of the communications sector, international air travel, and
power.
23.
Reinvigoration of structural reforms that increase the efficiency of state-owned
enterprises (SOEs) would contribute to a more vibrant private sector. Inefficient SOEs
are driving up the cost of doing business and constraining growth in the nonmineral sector.
Staff welcomed the Government’s commitment to developing a community service
obligation (CSO) framework, an important step towards the commercialization of SOEs.
Staff expressed encouragement in the progress towards implementing a national publicprivate partnership (PPP) policy that potentially facilitates much needed private infrastructure
investment (Box 5). Successful SOE reform will contribute towards a more enabling business
environment, which is essential for the attainment of more broad-based economic growth.

17

BOX 4. EQUILIBRIUM REAL EXCHANGE RATE1
Staff estimates show the exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals. The macro
balance (MB) approach indicates the kina is not significantly different from its estimated
equilibrium level and the equilibrium real exchange rate (ERER) approach points to a mild
overvaluation of 3.4 percent. The decomposition of the fitted values into time-varying
contributions of the explanatory variables suggests that demographic factors and the oil trade
balance are the main factors in determination of the equilibrium current account balance
under the MB approach. In the ERER approach, the terms of trade and government
consumption are the key factors.

BOX 5. STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISE REFORM1
State-owned enterprises (SOEs) continue to impede growth PNG. Some reforms and
performance improvements have been achieved, such as the commercialization of the Papua
New Guinea Banking Corporation, through a merger with Bank of South Pacific. However,
most SOEs continue to operate without budget constraints or profit objectives. Political
interference yields conflicting mandates, where SOEs must deliver community service
obligations (CSOs) without adequate compensation. While disclosure is improving, audited
SOE financial reports are still not public so ascertaining profitability is difficult. Where they
do not cover their costs of capital, and many likely do not, they represent an inefficient use of
public funds.
Successful reform will require making SOEs independent from political directives,
subject to binding budget constraints, exposed to competition, fully compensated for
CSOs, and fully accountable.2 Although competition is gradually being introduced in select
infrastructure sectors, it is being approached cautiously, placing substantial emphasis on
protecting incumbent SOEs. The introduction of competition enabled private sector
investment in the telecommunications, aviation and power sectors. More however needs to be
done particularly with those SOEs that will see considerable increases in demand from the
LNG projects. The Government is currently committed to the development of a CSO
framework which is an important step in SOE commercialization.
Increased private infrastructure investment is necessary to enable the business
environment. Cabinet's endorsement of a National Public Private Partnership (PPP) policy
in 2008 and ongoing preparation of a legal and institutional framework for implementation
will potentially facilitate needed private infrastructure investment. It is anticipated that the
greatest potential for PPP investments will be in the utility and transport sectors. Successful
implementation of the PPP policy will improve basic service delivery, reduce the costs of
doing business and create opportunities for private sector investment and growth, essential
ingredients for longer term prosperity in PNG.

Although there are likely to be significant interim fiscal costs associated with restructuring SOEs, these costs
have not been quantified, but they would be incurred gradually so as to make reform politically acceptable.

19
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
24.
We commend the authorities for maintaining a medium-term fiscal framework.
However, recent slippages in the implementation of the framework have undermined its
stabilization objective. Spending from accumulated mineral revenue above the framework’s
limit imparted a fiscal stimulus in 2009 larger than warranted. Although the 2010 budget
reduces the stimulus, the planned level of spending is likely to be too expansionary given the
expected strength in private activity. Further, spending from trust accounts outside the budget
will add to demand pressures. Delaying some infrastructure spending would ease overall
demand pressures and help ensure that good value is achieved from this spending.
25.
The construction phase of the LNG projects will increase the difficulty of
maintaining macroeconomic stability and enhancements to the MTFS could be helpful.
First, it would be prudent to lower the assumption of normal mineral revenue to 3 percent of
GDP between now and 2014, when LNG production should commence. This would reduce
pressures from public spending during a period of strong private spending and the increased
public savings could be used to finance currently unfunded government liabilities. Second,
annual consultation between the monetary and fiscal authorities should determine how much
of the 4 percent of GDP limit from above-normal mineral revenue can be spent.
26.
The implementation of the MTFS needs to be strengthened. The fiscal credibility
built during years of adherence to the framework can be easily lost, reducing long-term
growth prospects. Strict adherence to the framework will also help deliver the fiscal prudence
required to guard against unfavorable public debt dynamics from vulnerabilities such as those
arising from potential LNG project delays, lower commodity prices, and weaker external
demand.
27.
With LNG projects underway, now is the time to develop an SWF to manage
resource revenue. The best way forward is a financing fund that directs all public spending
through the budget, thereby enhancing macroeconomic stabilization and helping to ensure
high quality spending aligned with development objectives. To maximize the long-run
development impact of LNG income, domestic absorption capacity will need to guide the
rate of drawdown. Further, to minimize the potential for currency appreciation that would
undermine the welfare of rural populations that depends on agriculture exports, the fund’s
resources should be invested offshore. To effectively achieve its objectives, the SWF needs
to be integrated into the macro framework and thereby supported by other fiscal institutions,
such as the MTFS and the Fiscal Responsibility Act.
28.
Although inflation declined over 2009, monetary policy needs to be focused on
emerging inflation pressures. Compared to the recent episode of high inflation, domestic
demand will play a more important role in driving inflation up, which implies a greater risk
that high inflation could become entrenched in expectations. The central bank should be
tightening monetary policy now with a view to achieving real lending rates of around

20
6 percent. Further, to contain inflation and manage inflation expectations, they should be
prepared to maintain real lending rates around this level, or higher if significant overheating
occurs.
29.
Closer coordination of monetary and fiscal policy is desirable. Public trust
accounts should be moved to the BPNG and procedures to automatically deposit abovenormal mineral revenue with the central bank should be introduced. This will give the BPNG
better control over domestic liquidity and market interest rates, strengthening the
effectiveness of monetary policy. Also, the net cost to the public sector would be reduced by
limiting the need to use high-cost central bank bills to remove excess liquidity.
30.
Indicators suggest that the financial sector remains sound. However, to safeguard
financial health, banks should be encouraged to maintain strict lending standards as credit
demand increases in line with opportunities associated with the LNG projects. Furthermore,
all financial institutions need to guard against overexposure to the property sector that could
become significantly overvalued during the LNG construction phase.
31.
The projected widening in the current account deficit is not expected to threaten
external stability. The exchange rate is estimated to be broadly in line with fundamentals
and reserves remain adequate to address potential balance of payments needs.
32.
To achieve the Development Strategic Plan it will be essential to better align
development spending with priorities and reinvigorate the reform process. There has
been some progress on reform, with increased competition in telecommunications, aviation,
and power. However, more needs to be done, particularly with those state-owned enterprises
that will see considerable increases in demand for their services from the LNG projects. The
government’s commitment to implement a public-private-partnership policy is encouraging
and could potentially facilitate significant private investment in infrastructure. Improvements
to security and the business environment would also yield significant benefits.
33.
Staff recommends the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month
cycle.

Table 8. Papua New Guinea: Authorities' Response to Recent Fund Policy Advice 1/
Fund Recommendations
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
With the balance of risks to inflation on the downside because
of the deteriorating external environment, the central bank
should be prepared to loosen quickly if a larger-than expected
negative domestic impact materializes.
The currency should be allowed to adjust to help offset the
impact on export incomes. This policy would also help to
safeguard foreign currency reserves.
Fiscal Policy
Macroeconomic stability would be enhanced if the monetary
and fiscal authorities cooperated to ensure that the cyclical
position of the economy determined the magnitude of annual
spending from trust accounts.

Financial Sector Policy
The impact of declining commodity prices on export incomes
could stress debt-servicing capabilities, driving up
nonperforming loans. Therefore, banks should maintain strict
lending standards and monitor borrowers’ servicing abilities
carefully.
Structural Reforms
The public-sector reform program on health, education, and law
and order needs to be reinvigorated. Complete transparency of
the financial conditions of state-owned enterprises and full
transfer of their returns to general government revenue will be
necessary to implement the reform agenda.

Policy Actions
This risk did not materialize and the policy rate was kept stable
until year end when it was decreased by 100 bp to 7 percent in
December 2009, mostly due to the decline in inflation in the
third quarter of 2009.
Exchange rate moved flexibly. Reserves have increased to the
late-2008 level.

Senior Treasury officials now meet regularly with senior BPNG
officials to discuss current macroeconomic conditions, but no
explicit mechanisms have been introduced to ensure that
spending from above normal mineral revenue is consistent with
available spare capacity. Staff are currrently working with the
authorities to develop a formal modeling framework to do this.

Banks tightened lending standads by shortening average
amortization periods.

The government expanded the PPP Task Force to include the
Departments of Health, Education, Transport, Works, Lands
and Physical Planning, and Attorney General, and the National
Roads and Civil Aviation Authorities. Through the National
Executive Council, the government approved the national publicprivate partnership policy.

To permanently raise long-term growth in the nonmineral
sector, the resulting revenues and public ownership proceeds
from the LNG projects must be channeled through the budget
and directed toward effectively addressing development needs.

The authorities began exploring the benefits of creating a
soveriegn wealth fund to manage resource revenue. A working
group was established in early 2010 to prepare a proposal for
the government.

The government must press ahead with Fund
recommendations on the compilation and dissemination of
economic data.

Progress has been disappointing.

APPENDIX I: PAPUA NEW GUINEA: DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS1
Based on the low-income country debt sustainability analysis (LIC DSA), Papua New
Guinea is rated to be at a moderate risk of debt distress. The baseline public DSA suggests
that Papua New Guinea’s overall public sector debt dynamics are sustainable in light of the
current size and the evolution of the domestic stock. However, stress tests of both external
and public DSA suggest that vulnerabilities rise against shocks from slower export and
economic growth, which are related with uncertainties of the global economic recovery and
the construction phase of the LNG projects. Moreover, the inclusion of the LNG contingent
liabilities as well as other domestic liabilities would also undermine long-term fiscal
sustainability, addressing requirements for adherence to the authorities’ Medium-Term
Fiscal Strategy and the needs to establish a Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF) for more efficient
revenue management.
I. BACKGROUND
Papua New Guinea has been effectively reducing its public and external debt burden
over past years.2 Public debt indicators improved dramatically, with the public sector debt
ratio declining from 62 percent of GDP at end-2004 to an estimated 32 percent of GDP at
end-2009 (Table 1). The public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) external debt also decreased
from the peak of over 50 percent of GDP in 2001 to the current 13 percent of GDP (Table 2).
Over 90 percent of public external debt is with multilateral institutions such as the AsDB and
World Bank, with the rest mainly from Japan and Australia. Private sector external debt is
estimated at about 14 percent of GDP by end-2009.
II. ECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND UNDERLYING DSA ASSUMPTIONS
The impact of the global financial crisis on Papua New Guinea is limited due to a
relatively segmented financial market and strong recovery of commodity prices. Real
GDP growth slowed to 4.5 percent in 2009 accompanied by eased inflation. External demand
also weakened in 2009 and led to a current account deficit for the first time since 2002.
Consequently, the currency has depreciated in both nominal and real terms by end 2009. As

1

As Papua New Guinea is an IBRD/IDA blend country, this DSA is prepared by Fund staff in close
consultation with the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank (AsDB) under the IMF-WB DSA
framework for Low-Income Countries. The fiscal year of Papua New Guinea is the calendar year. An IMF
country team visited Papua New Guinea for Article IV consultation in February 2010.
2

Papua New Guinea is rated as a weak performer for its policies and institutions for the purposes of the IMFWB low-income country DSA framework. Consequently, the applicable thresholds for this category for external
public debt are: 30 percent for the present value (PV) of debt-to-GDP ratio; 100 percent for the PV of debt-toexports ratio, 200 percent for the PV of debt-to-revenue ratio, 15 percent for the debt service-to-exports ratio,
and 25 percent for the debt service-to-revenue ratio.

30
indicated in the 2008 DSA, Papua New Guinea is vulnerable to terms of trade shocks.3
However, unfavorable public debt dynamics did not materialize in 2009 as its terms of trade
deteriorated during the first half of 2009 but recovered quickly with rising commodity prices.
The economic outlook of Papua New Guinea is expected to improve with the approval
of two Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) projects in December 2009. During the construction
phase of the projects from 2010 to 2014, there will be increasing economic activities with
rising imports mostly financed by FDI inflows. The near-term challenge will be to maintain
macroeconomic stability with limited economic capacity. The LNG project is therefore
included in the baseline scenario and Box 1 summarizes the medium-term macroeconomic
framework underlying the DSA.
III. EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
The baseline scenario indicates that all PPG external debt and debt service ratios stay
well below the policy-dependent debt burden thresholds. However, the vulnerability of
the external debt sustainability remains if export value growth slows down in combination
with other shocks. The main results of the external DSA are the following:


The baseline scenario shows a slight increase in external debt burden in the
medium term before declining in the long run (Table 3 and the text table). This is
due to expected increase in disbursements of approved AsDB loans in the pipeline.
Since additional financing needs for the LNG project and the current account deficit
would be met with projected large FDI inflows, the PV of PPG external debt over
GDP would remain around 11 percent in the medium term, which is below the
30 percent of threshold. The PVs of PPG external debt-to-exports and debt-to-revenue
ratios are expected to stay well below the indicative threshold levels over the
projection period.



However, the debt burden is expected to breach the indicative thresholds under
some stress tests (Table 4 and Figure 1). External debt sustainability is most
vulnerable to shocks from lower export growth (Table 4). A decline in export value
growth in 2010–11, by one standard deviation below its historical average, would
raise the PV of public external debt-to-GDP ratio to 37 percentage points over the
medium term, and only fall below the 30 percent threshold after 2018. Other stress
tests including lower FDI inflows and a combination of several shocks above also
generate similar debt patterns which move to alarming levels.4

3

See Papua New Guinea: 2008 Article IV Consultation, IMF Staff Report 09/112.
Bound test B5, which combines four different shocks with smaller standard deviations than those shocks in
tests B1–B4, also shows the similar pattern of the debt dynamics with the shock from the export growth
dominates.
4

31


The scenarios indicated by stress tests on external debt burden are not trivial
and cannot be ruled out given the uncertainty ahead. Export demand could remain
weak if the recovery of the global economy is sluggish and a “double-dip” of
commodity prices happens. Moreover, the negotiation between the government and
local communities on land issues is ongoing and the construction of the LNG project
would not be fully launched before these issues are settled.

IV. PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS5
With a prudent fiscal policy and improved economic outlook, the overall public debt
dynamics for Papua New Guinea is favorable. During previous years of rising commodity
prices, windfall revenues were largely saved and public debt reduced. The public debt burden
is forecasted to decrease over the projection period under the baseline. Meanwhile, compared
to the 2008 Article IV DSA, given the LNG project now included in the baseline, it indicates
Papua New Guinea remains vulnerable to external shocks as well as domestic ones during the
construction period of the project. In addition, the inclusion of several contingent domestic
liabilities shows potential risks to long-run fiscal sustainability.


The baseline scenario projects a gradual decline in the public sector debt ratio
over the medium term. The public debt ratio is projected to decline to 23.8 percent
of GDP by 2015 (Table 1). The projected improvement results mainly from projected
rapid economic growth, large FDI inflows associated with the LNG project, a
continued prudent fiscal policy. The public debt is projected to decline further to
about 14 percent by 2030.



The alternative scenarios and bound tests for public debt sustainability show
that the projected debt path is particularly sensitive to changes in real GDP

Public debt includes domestic central government debt and external public and publicly guaranteed debt.

32
growth (Table 2 and Figure 2). A negative shock to real GDP growth6 in 2011–12
would increase the present value (PV) of the public debt-to-GDP ratio close to
80 percent in 2030. This shock can be again related with the progress of the LNG
construction given its significant contribution to the economic growth over the
medium term. Moreover, if a primary deficit of 5.8 percent in 2009 is assumed to
maintain for the projection period, the PV of the public debt-to-GDP ratio would be
above 200 percent in 2030. While the case of a persistent primary deficit is unlikely
to happen (in view of the unusual spending from the government trust account
in 2009), this highlights the need for the government to ensure the project is moving
forward as planned while protecting the priority spending in the event of a growth
slowdown. In addition, as discussed in the previous section, a decline in the export
growth would also exacerbate public debt burden.


Other country-specific liabilities from several potential sources may also
undermine fiscal sustainability. Government unfunded superannuation liabilities,
estimated to be about 9 percent of GDP by end-2009, will remain sizable though the
government has made partial repayment recently. The contingent liabilities related
with the LNG project are estimated to be, in PV term, about 20 percent of GDP
in 2014.7 Other liabilities, including borrowings by SOEs8 and the government’s
commitments under the memorandum of agreement with landowners, are also
estimated to be significant though detailed information on the magnitude and timing
is limited. These factors, as shown in the alternative scenario9 (Table 2 and Figure 2),
would result in unfavorable debt dynamics and add additional risks to public debt
sustainability.

6

The GDP growth shock in 2011–12 is defined as the historical average of GDP growth rate minus one
standard deviation. Another permanent GDP growth shock, which will bring the Debt-to-GDP ratio above
70 percent in 2030, is defined as the baseline GDP growth rate minus one standard deviation divided by the
square root of the length of the projection period.

7

These liabilities are arising from the issue of exchangeable bonds to finance the state’s equity participation (in
2009) and the state’s completion guarantee for debt financing (by 2014). Under this scheme, the creditor
acquires exchangeable bonds, amounting to US$1.1 billion, with the option to exchange the bonds for equities
in the Oil Search company. Under the completion guarantee, if the project fails, the government may have to
pay up to US$2 billion to the creditor. Other liabilities including the settlements with landowners (negotiation is
ongoing) may also be significant.
8

From 2008 Article IV DSA estimates, SOEs related contingent liabilities are about 2.5 percent of GDP when
we consider borrowings, various provisions, and other liabilities based on end-2007 financial statements of nine
SOEs. However, there is no information on the off-balance sheet liabilities which also may be significant.

9

The alternative scenario (All Other Liabilities: Pension, SOEs, and LNG contingent liabilities) assumes that
pension and SOEs liabilities are to be covered in the 2011 budget (total about 10 percent of GDP) and all LNG
contingent liabilities will materialize in 2014 (about 20 percent of GDP).

33
BOX 1. MACROECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING THE DSA


Real GDP growth is projected to be at 5.2 percent on average over the medium term,
above the historical average of 2.9 percent, and slow to 3 percent in the long run. In
the medium term rapid growth in the nonmineral sector, including in agriculture, as
well as several mining projects coming on stream will offset the decline in petroleum
and copper production and exports.



Inflation is projected to rise in the medium term due to increasing domestic demand
and near-term capacity constraints, while stabilizing at around 3 percent in the long
run.



The two LNG projects have a construction period of 5 years each, from 2010/11 to
2014/15. Production and exports are expected to commence in the second half of
2014, with a maximum capacity of about 60 million barrels of oil equivalent. The
peak impact of the projects is estimated to be an increase of 25 to 30 percent in
annual GDP growth. These 30-year projects are estimated to increase annual GDP
growth, through both direct and indirect channels, by about 15 to 20 percent on
average. Accounting for the substantial income outflows, the projects are expected
to increase annual GNI by about 9 percent.



The current account (including grants) is estimated to be in deficit in 2009 and the
deficit is projected to remain over the medium term until 2013, primarily reflecting the
strong import growth related with the construction phase of the LNG project. FDI
inflows from foreign shareholders are projected to increase substantially given the
financing scheme of the project.



The grant element of loans is expected to decline. As per capita income rises, the
share of external financing provided on concessional terms is expected to decline
gradually over the projection period.1



The fiscal balance is estimated to turn into a deficit2 in 2009 due to falling mineral
revenues and the spending of preceding years’ mineral windfall revenues. The
deficit is financed by a rundown of resources held in trust accounts. Over the
medium term it is projected to remain balanced.

__________________________
1

Grant-equivalent financing (in percent of GDP) increases slightly in the near term before it declines in the
long run, due to the expected large disbursement from the AsDB in the pipeline.
2
The deficit is estimated by Fund staff. The official 2009 budget outcome does not include the large amount
of spending from the government trust account held outside the budget. The trust accounts consist of saving
from mineral windfall revenues in past years to address development and debt reduction needs. However,
since 2008 the government has relaxed constraints on trust account spending. Trust spending was the main
factor shifting the fiscal balance from a surplus of 2.5 percent of GDP in 2008 to a deficit of almost
8 percent of GDP in 2009. The result was a fiscal impulse of almost 13 percent of GDP.

V. CONCLUSION
It is the staffs’ view that Papua New Guinea should be considered at moderate risk of
debt stress based on both external debt burden indicators and stress tests on public
debt pattern. Although the baseline scenario indicates that all external PPG debt burden
indicators are below their indicative thresholds, the projected PPG debt paths shows
significant vulnerability against shocks from slower export and economic growth. The
inclusion of the LNG contingent liability as well as other domestic liabilities would also add
concerns to long-term fiscal sustainability.
Enhanced debt management with adherence to the Medium-Term Fiscal Strategy
(MTFS) would be required to offset the underlying risks in public debt sustainability.
The staff encourages the authorities to improve implementation of the MTFS during the
construction phase of the LNG project to guard against unfavorable public debt dynamics
from vulnerabilities such as those arising from potential LNG project delays, lower
commodity prices, and weaker external demand. The staff also encourages the authorities to
consider the establishment of a Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF) to manage revenues from
those projects more efficiently and to further strengthen debt management capacity.

1/ Variables include real GDP grow th, grow th of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flow s.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrow ing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., w hile grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the low er level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in w hich the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

When a member has overdue financial obligations outstanding for more than three months, the amount of such
arrears will be shown in this section.

VII.

Safeguards Assessments:

Under the Fund's Safeguards Assessments policy, the Bank of Papua New Guinea (BPNG) was
subject to a transitional assessment based on its Stand By Arrangement with the Fund, which was
approved in March 2000 and expired in September 2001. The transitional assessment was
completed on May 4, 2001 and made recommendations to alleviate identified weaknesses.
Currently, the BPNG is not subject to the Safeguards Assessments policy.
VIII. Exchange Rate Arrangement:
Papua New Guinea has a floating exchange rate arrangement; the exchange rate of the kina is
determined in the interbank market in which authorized banks participate. Papua New Guinea
has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, and maintains an exchange
system free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions.

IX.

Article IV Consultation:

The 2008 Article IV consultation discussions were held during December 4–15, 2008. It was
concluded by the Executive Board on March 16, 2009 (IMF Country Report No. 09/112).
Papua New Guinea is on the 12–month cycle.
X.

Technical Assistance from Headquarters:

FAD: A joint FAD/PFTAC mission in March 2000 assisted the authorities in preparing a
Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes Fiscal Transparency Module, published in
October 2000. A mission in December 2000 provided advice on the reconciliation of large
and volatile differences in fiscal reporting based on information provided by the Treasury
Department and information reported by the Bank of Papua New Guinea. A mission in
February 2002 assessed progress in improving fiscal transparency.
LEG: A mission in November 1996 provided advice on the legal framework for the National
Value-Added Tax. A mission in November 2005 provided advice on the drafting of a tax
administration law. A mission in July 2006 provided a comprehensive program of assistance
in the development of the AML/CFT regime, including legislative drafting and capacity
building. A mission in August/September 2007 assisted the authorities in finalizing the terms
of the Revenue Administration Bill.
MFD/MCM: During 2001–03 assistance was provided through missions in bank supervision,
financial sector restructuring and improving the accounting framework and monetary operations
of the central bank. A resident advisor was assigned to the BPNG research department for
15 months through August 2003. Technical assistance through peripatetic visits was delivered
on bank regulation and supervision (2001–February/March 2007, July-August 2009, and
February 2010), medium-term monetary policy formulation (October 2004 and September
2005), reserve management (June 2006–September 2007, March/July-August 2009, JanuaryFebruary 2010), internal audits (2004–August 2007), accounting (September/October 2006–
February 2007, February-March/June-July/November 2009), liquidity management (January
2009), and monetary and forex operations (July-August 2009, February 2010).
STA: Four GDDS missions took place in 1995–96; one inspection visit was conducted in
April 2001; one mission provided advice on the compilation of national accounts in February
2006; and one mission provided advice on balance of payments in May 2003. A mission
reviewed monetary and financial statistics in April 2005 and a follow-up mission took place
in May 2006. Subsequently, a multisector statistics mission visited in September 2006
followed by a high level STA visit in December 2007. Two follow-up missions in balance of
payments took place in June 2008 and November 2009 and two follow-up missions in
monetary and financial statistics took place in April 2008 and November 2009.

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CENTRE1
(As of March 30, 2010)
Until the Resident Representative position was closed in May 2008, the resident
representative helped coordinating TA assistance to Papua New Guinea (PNG), with the
extensive assistance provided by the Australian Enhanced Cooperation Program (ECP).
Since 2000, PFTAC has provided more than 25 missions to PNG, and the Government has
sent over 50 officials to the Centre’s regional seminars, workshops, and training courses in
this period.
Public Financial Management
PFTAC assisted in the preparation of a ROSC, which was published in October 2000. The
PFTAC PFM Advisor has participated in occasional FAD technical assistance missions, and
an attachment of one PNG official to PFTAC was completed in April 2007. PNG
participated, with four officials, in the US Treasury study visit in September 2008.
Tax Administration and Policy
The IMF Legal Department drafted a Tax Administration Act in 2005, adopted by the
Government in 2006, that: (i) the re-established the Internal Revenue Commission as an
independent tax authority; and (ii) included customs administrative provisions. An IMF
Legal Department mission in September 2007 prepared the Internal Revenue Commission
Administration Bill 2007 to strengthen and consolidate all revenue administrative provisions
into one statute.
PFTAC has delivered a project to: objectively assess the existing IT system of the Internal
Revenue Commission and; develop and draft an information technology strategic plan (ITSP)
and: based on the ITSP, draft a business plan for the redevelopment of the IT system. The
project comprised of a number of missions between 2006 and 2009 that delivered:
 An assessment of the current and future business drivers.
 Development of the business system architecture for the ITSP.
 Completion of the applications, information and IT technical architecture phases of the
ITSP project.
 Recommendations for the management and delivery of IT services within the IRC.

Financial Sector Regulation and Supervision
There is no current PFTAC involvement in this area, as technical assistance is provided by
MCM, but the Advisor visited BPNG in September 2004 and July 2005 to identify areas
where technical assistance could be provided. In October 2005, the BPNG hosted the annual
meeting of the Association of Financial Supervisors of Pacific Countries, for which PFTAC
is the secretariat. In March 2007, PFTAC funded an attachment for two supervisors from
BPNG to assist the Cook Islands’ supervisory authority to undertake an on-site examination
of a domestic bank. In 2008, PFTAC funded an attachment of one supervisor to assist the
Reserve Bank of Fiji under an on-site examination of a local branch of a PNG-based bank.
Economic and Financial Statistics
In February 2006, the Advisor briefly assessed the BOP compilation with a view to improve
its quality, and to assess progress against recommendations made by previous missions. A
multi-sector statistics mission in September 2006 assessed the statistical systems (BOP,
national accounts, prices statistics, government finance statistics and monetary statistics),
with the PFTAC Advisor assessing the national accounts and providing overall coordination.
The BOP expert provided some TA to progress improvements to the methodology and source
data. In 2008 and 2009 the Advisor undertook balance of payment (BOP) statistics missions
to review statistics prerequisites, progress in improving compilation methods and source
data, as well as to assist Bank of PNG statistics staff in assessing the feasibility of electronic
data collection.

ANNEX III: PAPUA NEW GUINEA—RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP

(As of April 12, 2010)
The World Bank Group has a long history of engagement in Papua New Guinea (PNG). PNG
formally became a member of the World Bank upon gaining independence in 1975 but had been
a recipient of loans from the World Bank since 1968. To date, the World Bank has provided PNG
with 36 IBRD loans totaling US$786.6 million and 16 IDA credits totaling US$195.0 million in
commitments.
The Bank’s relationship with the Government of PNG in 2003–06 was uneven as a result of
policy differences resulting eventually in the suspension and later cancellation of the Forestry
Conservation Project. Between 2003 and 2006 the World Bank did not approve any loans or
credits for PNG and focused instead on analytical and outreach activities.
Following a significant improvement in political stability and macroeconomic performance, and
as an integral part of intensive efforts by the Country Management team to repair the relationship
with the Government, the Bank launch an joint effort with the Government in 2007 to prepare a
full four-year Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), which was approved by the Bank’s Board of
Directors on December 18, 2007. The FY08–11 CAS articulated a long-term partnership between
the Bank and PNG aimed at supporting sound management of economy and natural resources,
and addressing immediate livelihood and service delivery needs of the poor people, while also
building a foundation for tackling longer-term institutional and accountability challenges.
Empowering women and youth, and strengthening governance are prioritized as cross-cutting
themes in the program.
Under the FY08–11 CAS, the World Bank provides PNG with concessional financial resources
on the order of US$40 million per year2 and assists the country in accessing global and regional
grant funds such as Global Environmental Facility. In the first two years of the CAS, the Bank
approved the Smallholder Agriculture Development Project (US$27.5 million; approved by the
Board in December 2007) and the Second Mining Sector Institutional Strengthening Project
(US$17.0 million; approved in June 2008). Together with the ongoing Road Maintenance and
Rehabilitation Project totaling US$40.0 million in IBRD and US$37.3 million in IDA
commitments, these projects represent the World Bank’s current credit portfolio in PNG. In
addition to the loan and credits, the Bank is also currently implementing a Global Environment
Facility-supported Teachers’ Solar Lighting Project (US$0.99 million) and the regional
Sustainable Energy Financing Project, which covers also PNG.
In line with PNG’s medium-term debt strategy which envisions limiting external public
borrowing primarily to concessional terms and using mineral windfall revenue for early
2

PNG is formally a blend IBRD-IDA country. However, PNG’s debt strategy does not provide for nonconcessional borrowing and no immediate IBRD lending to PNG is therefore envisioned.

7
repayment of more expensive debt, in late 2007 the Government pre-paid seven IBRD loans
totaling US$56 million. As a result, PNG’s debt outstanding to the World Bank as endDecember, 2009 stood at US$229.6 million compared to over US$321.5 million at the end of
2006. In December 2008, the Government made an additional prepayment of four more IBRD
loans totaling about US$15 million.
The pipeline of the World Bank projects under preparation is rapidly expanding as the last two
years of the FY08–11 CAS unfold. Currently five projects are being prepared:
 Productive Partnership in Agriculture (focusing on coffee and cocoa sub-sectors,
scheduled for Board discussion in April 2010),
 Rural Communications (which will create a fund to roll out telecommunications services
to uneconomic areas, scheduled for Board in May 2010),
 Urban Youth Empowerment (aiming at expanding training and job opportunities for
urban youth, planned for Board in June or July 2010),
 Second Chance Education through Flexible and Open Distance Education, FODE (seeks
to improve quality and completion of equivalency programs to provide jobseekig schoolleavers with credentials, targeted for Board in July 2010) and
 SME Access to Finance IDA-IFC Risk-Sharing Facility (risk-sharing facility with
technical assistance to support increased lending by commercial banks to national SMEs
poised to benefit from large resource projects, scheduled for Board in August 2010).
The Rural Service Delivery and Local Governance (focusing on small community-level
development projects), is being reconfigured at preparation stage to better fit with the GoPNG’s
new strategic planning frameworks as recently launched, and is now expected for end FY11.
Two more projects— Energy Sector Strategy Technical Assistance (replacing the CAS-listed
Rural Electrification Project at GoPNG request), and a Programmatic Support to Health—are at
the concept stage. The Bank is also moving forward with mobilizing additional global grant
resources for PNG, in particular through the Fast Track Initiative for Education.
The Bank’s analytical work and technical assistance include economic monitoring and reporting,
dialogue with the Government as part of the programmatic Public Expenditure Review and
Rationalization process, and support to the nationally representative Household Income and
Expenditure Survey (jointly with AusAID). The Bank is also assisting the Government in
preparing a Climate Change Strategy. The Bank’s support to civil society has consisted of two
rounds of the Development Marketplace-type Youth Competition (in 2006 and 2008) which
provided small grants to promising grassroots development project. The Bank has also been
involved in a number of community outreach activities through its Global Development Learning
Network and Public Information Center. As part of its strengthening commitment to PNG, the
Bank Group has also expanded the staff of its Port Moresby office, adding national professional
staff and international staff on both the IFC and World Bank side.
The Bank’s private sector arm, International Financial Corporation, has also strengthened the
level of its engagement in PNG over the past few years. IFC’s Advisory Services—Pacific (IFCAS Pacific) established a full-time presence in PNG in early 2006, co-located with the World

8
Bank. Since then IFC advisory service activity in PNG has increased considerably, with a focus
on access to finance, tourism, the business environment, and infrastructure.
Within these programs IFC-AS Pacific is working to: improve the capacity of commercial banks
to provide credit; increase the availability of finance and financial services for the poor, including
investment in PNG Microfinance; assist in building financial infrastructure, including
establishment and strengthening of a credit referral bureau; improve the business environment including by working on a sub-set of the Doing Business indicators, strengthen the operating
environment for the tourism sector; improve agribusiness production, quality, supply chains and
marketing; and explore—jointly with the Bank—opportunities to support growth in the
commercial fisheries sector, including enabling work on a special economic zone to host regional
tuna processing.
The IFC’s current investment portfolio in PNG consists of a US$1.2 million equity commitment
to PNG Microfinance Limited, of which US$936 thousand has already been disbursed, giving
IFC a 19 percent shareholding in the institution. The equity investment is supported by a US$2
million institutional capacity building program presently under implementation. IFC also
currently has a legacy US$3.6 million investment in Kula I Fund and a recent US$4 million
investment in Kula II Fund, both of which are Pacific regional private equity facilities. IFC has
provided Digicel PNG Ltd with a US$80 million senior loan to support the expansion of its
national mobile telephony network, a US$44 million line of credit to global agribusiness
company ECOM Ltd. for coffee supply chain improvement across 6 countries, including PNG,
and $4 million in equity funding to KK Kingston Limited, a PNG based supplier of hardware,
commercial and household goods. In addition, the IFC is pursuing investment opportunities in
financial markets, agribusiness, gas and mining and infrastructure.
The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) has provided one guarantee in PNG. The
guarantee worth US$76.6 million in gross exposure covers a portion of equity investment and a
loan by a syndicate of commercial lending institutions for the Lihir open-pit gold mine. The
guarantee facilitated several hundred million US$ in foreign investment in PNG.

ANNEX IV: PAPUA NEW GUINEA—RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK3
(As of December 31, 2009)
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has approved 67 loans to Papua New Guinea (PNG)
totaling $1,247 million for 49 projects, of which 27 loans ($583 million) have been extended
from ordinary capital resources while 40 loans ($664 million) from special funds resources.
The special fund resources were also used for one grant amounting $15 million. In addition,
$62.4 million has been provided for 153 technical assistance projects. There are currently 13
active loans involving 8 projects (and one special fund grant-financed project).
A Country Program Strategy Mid-Term Review (CPSMTR), concluded in December 2008,
confirmed the rationale and validity of the Country Strategy and Program (CSP) for 20062010, approved in June 2006, which focuses on key strategic areas, including private sector
development, the transport sector, public financial management and health and HIV/AIDS. In
addition, reforming public sector enterprises remains a key issue.
The ADB’s lending to PNG for 2009-2011 is expected to remain a blend from the Asian
Development Fund (ADF) and ordinary capital resources (OCR). ADB's ADF allocation for
PNG for 2009-2011 totals approximately $170 million and a similar level of OCR lending is
expected. Lending activities will support power, roads, civil aviation, water transport,
primary health and microfinance expansion.
Indicative non-lending assistance for 2009-2011 totals $13.8 million ($16.8 including cofinancing). Consistent with the Country Strategy and Planning document, non-lending
assistance continues to focus on project preparation, strengthening governance, and
improving public sector management.
In 2009, the ADB approved financing of the Civil Aviation Development Investment
Program that supports the socioeconomic development of the country by providing safe,
efficient, reliable, sustainable, and affordable aviation services and infrastructure to facilitate
access to the country and improve the mobility of communities. The ADB also approved
financing of the Pilot Border Trade and Investment Development Program that will help
improve the business environment in West Sepik Province by reducing the business
transaction costs associated with infrastructure, compliance with government rules and
regulations, and thin human capital.

ANNEX V: PAPUA NEW GUINEA—STATISTICAL ISSUES
As of April 9, 2010
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. Most affected areas
are: national accounts, fiscal accounts, and balance of payments.
National Accounts: The National Statistical Office (NSO) lacks sufficient staff with computer training. The
accuracy and reliability of the data are affected by inadequate source data. The Bank of Papua New Guinea
(BPNG) and the Department of Treasury produce the most current data. In mid-2000, the NSO released a set of
national accounts estimates: National Income, Expenditure and Product, 1993–98. These estimates were
compiled using the 1968 System of National Accounts. However, the NSO has been working to implement the
1993 SNA. In March 2004, the NSO released a preliminary set of national income, expenditure, and production
accounts estimates for 1994–2002, rebased to 1998 prices. As these figures are still in need of substantial
improvements, the 2006 STA multisector mission recommended against publication of the new GDP data until
the needed revisions are made. In an attempt to fill the vacuum, the Treasury—responsible for Government
finance statistics (GFS)—has actually assumed the role of estimating the NA for 2002 to the present.
Price statistics: The NSO currently compiles a new quarterly wholesale price index (which it does not publish)
and a quarterly consumer price index that is based on weights that are thirty three years old. The NSO intends to
use the results of the planned Household Income Expenditure Survey (HIES) to rebase the CPI; however, this
has been delayed for a long time.
Government finance statistics: Annual GFS reported to STA suffer from insufficient coverage. While central
government tax revenue statistics are generally accurate and timely, nontax revenue and public expenditure data
are deficient. In particular, development budget expenditures and the utilization of grants and project loans are
recorded with long lags, and few records on the use of trust accounts are available. While interest payment
records are accurate, there are timing issues regarding the recording of interest on discount securities. These
weaknesses contribute to discrepancies in domestic financing between estimates from monetary and debt data
and those derived from fiscal records. The 2006 STA multisector mission encouraged the authorities to prepare
a list of public sector units to permit a comprehensive delineation of the levels of government, which should
help reconcile the GFS with other datasets.
Monetary statistics: Monetary data are now being produced on a regular basis and reporting to STA has
improved. Three monetary and financial statistics missions (April 2005, May 2006, April 2008, and November
2009) visited Papua New Guinea which helped to (i) finalize the review of the collection, compilation, and
dissemination procedures of monetary statistics by the BPNG; (ii) develop a work program to facilitate the full
implementation of the methodology recommended in the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM);
(iii) prepare the standardized report forms (SRFs) for reporting monetary data of the central bank, other
depository corporations, other financial corporations, and monetary aggregates; and (iv) finalize the integrated
monetary database that meets the data needs of the BPNG, STA, and APD.
Balance of payments: Annual balance of payments data are derived from the International Transactions
Reporting System (ITRS), which is not tightly monitored despite the BPNG reporting requirements. There are
marked differences between the official data on exports and imports of goods and those reported by trading
partners. The financial accounts data are of poor quality because of major deficiencies in data collection,
especially in the areas of private external debt. Quarterly data are also published by the BPNG. The 2006 STA
multisector mission identified as a priority to strengthen current account estimates, including through improved
classification of investment earnings, trade credits, and grant receipts as well as enhancing source data for
imports and exports. Progress is being made to implement the recommendations from the PFTAC’s BOP
mission in June 2008. Follow up BOP statistics mission is undertaken in November 2009. Detailed BOP
statistics are under review to be released in the near future.

III. Reporting to STA
Papua New Guinea last reported government finance statistics for publication in the Government Finance
Statistics Yearbook and in International Financial Statistics for 1999-2002 and cover only budgetary central
government.
Monetary data are reported to STA for publication in the IFS and IFS Supplement on Monetary and Financial
Statistics on a regular monthly basis.
Balance of payments data for 2005 were reported to STA for publication in the IFS and in BOPSY
National accounts data for 2004 were reported to STA for publication in the IFS

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation with
Papua New Guinea
On May 19, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with Papua New Guinea on a lapse of time basis. Under the IMF’s lapse
of time procedures, the Executive Board completes Article IV consultations without convening
formal discussions.
Background
Macroeconomic performance has improved, but Papua New Guinea remains a poor country
highly exposed to commodity price fluctuations. GDP per capita remains low and improvement
has lagged other low-income countries in the region. An unattractive investment environment,
due primarily to weak infrastructure, problems with governance, and high crime, curtails
development.
Real activity was relatively unaffected by the global downturn, with growth easing to roughly
5 percent in 2009 from 7 percent in 2008. A number of factors contributed to this favorable
outcome. The country’s financial sector was insulated from the turmoil in global capital markets
and domestic credit continued to grow, albeit at a slower pace than in the preceding few years.
Export demand also held up, as stimulus measures in other Asian countries supported demand
for commodities, the country’s main export. Finally, following a prudent fiscal policy during the
years of booming commodity prices left the government in a position to fund a significant fiscal
expansion that help support domestic demand.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2

Over the course of 2009, inflation moderated substantially. After peaking in September 2008 at
roughly 13 percent, inflation fell to under 6 percent by end-2009, primarily from declines in
international food and energy prices.
After maintaining a tight monetary stance since mid-2008, the Bank of Papua New Guinea
(BPNG) reduced the policy rate in December 2009. Despite increasing with the decline in
inflation, real lending rates are currently below their long-term average, suggesting monetary
conditions are accommodative. After several years of posting surpluses, the stimulus in 2009
shifted the fiscal balance into a deficit of almost 8 percent of GDP. With the 2010 Budget
targeting fiscal balance, a significant portion of the stimulus is being withdrawn.
Following several years where both the real and nominal effective exchange rates were stable,
the turmoil in global markets in late-2008 and early-2009 induced a period of volatility. However,
the exchange market has stabilized and effective exchange rates have returned close to their
previous five-year averages. The decline in export commodity prices shifted the current account
into deficit in 2009 for the first time in six years. However, external debt rose only modestly to
about 29 percent of GDP at end-2009.
Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the 2010 Article IV consultation with Papua New Guinea, Executive Directors
endorsed staff’s appraisal, as follows:
We commend the authorities for maintaining a medium-term fiscal framework. However, recent
slippages in the implementation of the framework have undermined its stabilization objective.
Spending from accumulated mineral revenue above the framework’s limit imparted a fiscal
stimulus in 2009 larger than warranted. Although the 2010 budget reduces the stimulus, the
planned level of spending is likely to be too expansionary given the expected strength in private
activity. Further, spending from trust accounts outside the budget will add to demand pressures.
Delaying some infrastructure spending would ease overall demand pressures and help ensure
that good value is achieved from this spending.
The construction phase of the Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) projects will increase the difficulty of
maintaining macroeconomic stability and enhancements to the Medium-Term Fiscal Strategy
(MTFS) could be helpful. First, it would be prudent to lower the assumption of normal mineral
revenue to 3 percent of GDP between now and 2014, when LNG production should commence.
This would reduce pressures from public spending during a period of strong private spending
and the increased public savings could be used to finance currently unfunded government
liabilities. Second, annual consultation between the monetary and fiscal authorities should
determine how much of the 4 percent of GDP limit from above-normal mineral revenue can be
spent.
The implementation of the MTFS needs to be strengthened. The fiscal credibility built during
years of adherence to the framework can be easily lost, reducing long-term growth prospects.
Strict adherence to the framework will also help deliver the fiscal prudence required to guard

3
against unfavorable public debt dynamics from vulnerabilities such as those arising from
potential LNG project delays, lower commodity prices, and weaker external demand.
With LNG projects underway, now is the time to develop a sovereign wealth fund (SWF) to
manage. The best way forward is a financing fund that directs all public spending through the
budget, thereby enhancing macroeconomic stabilization and helping to ensure high quality
spending aligned with development objectives. To maximize the long-run development impact
of LNG income, domestic absorption capacity will need to guide the rate of drawdown. Further,
to minimize the potential for currency appreciation that would undermine the welfare of rural
populations that depends on agriculture exports, the fund’s resources should be invested
offshore. To effectively achieve its objectives, the SWF needs to be integrated into the macro
framework and thereby supported by other fiscal institutions, such as the MTFS and the Fiscal
Responsibility Act.
Although inflation declined over 2009, monetary policy needs to be focused on emerging
inflation pressures. Compared to the recent episode of high inflation, domestic demand will play
a more important role in driving inflation up, which implies a greater risk that high inflation could
become entrenched in expectations. The central bank should be tightening monetary policy now
with a view to achieving real lending rates of around 6 percent. Further, to contain inflation and
manage inflation expectations, they should be prepared to maintain real lending rates around
this level, or higher if significant overheating occurs.
Closer coordination of monetary and fiscal policy is desirable. Public trust accounts should be
moved to the BPNG and procedures to automatically deposit above-normal mineral revenue
with the central bank should be introduced. This will give the BPNG better control over domestic
liquidity and market interest rates, strengthening the effectiveness of monetary policy. Also, the
net cost to the public sector would be reduced by limiting the need to use high-cost central bank
bills to remove excess liquidity.
Indicators suggest that the financial sector remains sound. However, to safeguard financial
health, banks should be encouraged to maintain strict lending standards as credit demand
increases in line with opportunities associated with the LNG projects. Furthermore, all financial
institutions need to guard against overexposure to the property sector that could become
significantly overvalued during the LNG construction phase.
The projected widening in the current account deficit is not expected to threaten external
stability. The exchange rate is estimated to be broadly in line with fundamentals and reserves
remain adequate to address potential balance of payments needs.
To achieve the Development Strategic Plan it will be essential to better align development
spending with priorities and reinvigorate the reform process. There has been some progress on
reform, with increased competition in telecommunications, aviation, and power. However, more
needs to be done, particularly with those state-owned enterprises that will see considerable
increases in demand for their services from the LNG projects. The government’s commitment to
implement a public-private-partnership policy is encouraging and could potentially facilitate

4
significant private investment in infrastructure. Improvements to security and the business
environment would also yield significant benefits.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat
Reader to view this pdf file) for the 2010Article IV Consultation with Papua New Guinea is also
available.
