INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA
Staff Report for the 2009 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the European Department
(In consultation with other departments)
Approved by Juha Kähkönen and Martin Mühleisen
April 28, 2009
Executive Summary
Background: Slovenia's economy is increasingly affected by the global crisis through
decelerating investment and foreign demand. A recession started in fall 2008 and will
continue until growth resumes in the main trading partners. Despite their dependency on
foreign funding, banks have so far weathered the global crisis relatively well.
Challenges: The immediate goal should be to minimize the negative spillovers from the
global crisis on the real economy and the financial system. In the medium term, Slovenia will
face new challenges from more competitive neighboring countries and lower potential growth.
In the long term, an aging population threatens fiscal sustainability under the current pension
rules.
Staff views: The fiscal stimulus has been so far appropriate but fiscal policy should be
tightened when aggregate demand rebounds. The contingency plan to help banks’ funding is
appropriate but the authorities need to step up the monitoring of credit risk. Slovenia needs
reforms in the labor and product markets to bolster competitiveness. Pension system
sustainability requires rising retirement age and moderating pension indexation.
Authorities’ views: The authorities’ goal is to attenuate the effects of the crisis through a
fiscal stimulus package and measures to preserve credit flow. However, fiscal sustainability is
a priority and the deficit will be kept under 4 percent of GDP in 2009. The authorities are
considering options to reform the pension system.
Mission team: Mr. Spilimbergo (Head, RES), Ms. Jaumotte, and Mr. Xiao (both EUR)
visited Ljubljana March 2–11, 2009 and held discussions with the Minister of Finance, the
Governor of the Bank of Slovenia, and other key economic ministers, government officials
and representatives of parliament, financial sector, labor, business and media. Ms. Maver
(Adviser to the Executive Director) attended also the meetings.

I. CONTEXT
1.
The economy overheated following the
adoption of the euro in 2007. After a decade of
solid economic growth, Slovenia’s per capita
income rose to 90.8 percent of the EU average in
2008. With the adoption of the euro, inflation rose to
the highest level in the Euro area, wage growth
eroded competitiveness, the real exchange rate
appreciated, and the current account deficit widened
significantly.

The global crisis hit Slovenia in the fall of 2008 (Table 1, Figures 1 and 2).
Following 5.4 percent in the first half of 2008, growth slowed to 1.4 percent in the second half
of the year, with a sharp decline in the last quarter. Manufacturing and trade, and later
investment, decelerated sharply. Private consumption growth moderated from the high level in
2007.

3.
The labor market lost momentum at the end of 2008 (Figure 3). Until fall 2008,
employment creation was strong, especially in construction and services, with full-time
employment increasing 3 percent. Nominal wage growth also accelerated to 8.3 percent in
2008, as wage agreements were implemented. However, the labor market cooled in the fall,
with unemployment increasing to 4.3 percent in the last quarter.
4.
Inflation has dropped sharply since the
summer (Figure 4). Reflecting a strong
pass-through of fuel and food prices, inflation
stood at 5.5 percent in 2008, 2.2 percentage points
above Euro-area inflation. In addition,
second-round effects led to a pickup in core
inflation to 3.8 percent in 2008. After reaching a

peak of 6.9 percent in July, inflation came down to 2.1 percent in February 2009, owing to the
decline in fuel and food prices and the slowing economic activity.1
5.
The government’s budget was broadly balanced in 2008, with a positive fiscal
impulse (Table 2, Figure 5). The fiscal deficit was 0.3 percent of GDP in 2008, slightly better
than budgeted owing to strong revenues from direct taxes. The fiscal impulse was 0.7 percent
of GDP, reflecting a deterioration in the structural balance. Public debt stayed broadly
unchanged at 23 percent of GDP.
6.
Monetary conditions tightened in the fall 2008 (Figure 6). Until then, monetary
conditions were loose as the decline in real interest rates more than offset the real exchange
rate appreciation. However, monetary conditions tightened in the fall when the rapid decline
in inflation led to an increase in real interest rates. Private credit growth also decelerated
sharply.
7.
The financial sector is increasingly affected by the global crisis (Figure 7). Banks
weathered relatively well the first impact of the crisis, thanks to their limited exposure to the
U.S. financial system, the low level of households’ indebtedness, and the financial stability
measures promptly put in place by the authorities. However, equity prices have fallen
sharply, following international trends, and banks’ funding costs have risen with a soaring
sovereign risk spread. In response to tight international liquidity, banks have partly substituted
foreign financing with other sources including ECB funds and government deposits. Loans to
the nonfinancial private sector have decelerated sharply and banks’ profits have fallen.
8.
The current account deficit continued to rise,

account deficit for Slovenia is around 2–2.5 percent, the actual level observed in 2004–06.2
While the significant deterioration in the current account since 2006 included some temporary
components (the oil price hikes), the overheating of the economy led to second-round effects
and a deterioration of competitiveness. Unit labor costs grew by 2.2 percent in 2007 and
7.6 percent in 2008. Hence, both the CPI-based and ULC-based real effective exchange rates
have undergone an appreciation in the order of 5 percent. Using the three CGER
methodologies, staff estimates that the competitiveness gap is 6 to 9 percent. The lagging
competitiveness also reflects a lack of technological upgrading and the catch-up of regional
competitors with resulting stagnating market shares over the past few years.3
II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
10.
The policy discussion focused on the outlook, the policy responses to the crisis, the
medium-term challenges of competitiveness and structural reforms, and the sustainability of
the pension system. In the past, the authorities have broadly followed staff’s
recommendations, although less so in the areas of fiscal policy and structural reforms (Box 1).

A. Outlook
11.
The authorities and staff concurred that the economy will experience a recession
in 2009. Staff projects that output will contract by 2.7 percent in 2009 following the sharp
decline in the last quarter of 2008 (Table 6). The main factors driving the downturn are the
deceleration of exports, as the Euro zone is in recession, and of investment, as credit
conditions tighten and exports decelerate. Through production linkages, Slovenia’s export
industry is particularly sensitive to the cycle of the automotive industry. Private consumption
should be more resilient because of the recent wage increases and the strong net asset position
of the households (Box 2). Staff revised sharply downward the projections during the mission
as the negative news on the last quarter of 2008 became known. In light of the new data, the
authorities also revised their projections with the Bank of Slovenia (BoS) forecasting a
contraction of 2 percent and the Ministry of Finance (MoF) expecting a more pessimistic
contraction of 4 percent, on the account of lower employment, consumption, and investment.
Box 2: Sectoral Balance Sheets
Sectoral balance sheet analysis suggests that Slovenian corporates have large net financial
liabilities. Moreover, domestic banks’ exposure to the rest of world is significant and increasing,
exposing them to contagion in the international financial market. However, households are in a
strong position with small liabilities vis-à-vis the other sectors of the economy.

Inflation and the current account deficit are projected to moderate. With the
output gap projected to turn negative and world commodity prices declining, inflation is
expected to slow to about 0.5 percent in 2009 and 1.5 in 2010. The current account will
benefit from the decline in commodity prices and the slowdown in imports as aggregate
demand decelerates. However, recent devaluation in neighboring countries will increase
competition in the Slovenia’s traditional export markets. Debt sustainability analysis suggests
that Slovenia’s external debt will continue to rise in the medium term. To prevent the current

8
account deficit from staying above 5 percent of GDP in the medium term, wage moderation
and strong productivity gains are necessary.

13.
The authorities and staff agreed that risks to growth and the current account
are on the downside, while risks to inflation are on the upside. International spillovers will
transmit through Slovenia’s tight trade integration with Europe, as well as the banking system.
The main downward risks to growth are lower-than-projected growth in Europe, and a credit
crunch in the event that foreign financing dries up. Private consumption could prove to be less
resilient than projected as a consequence of a weaker labor market. Finally, a failure to stem
the fast wage growth observed in 2008 would lead to a persistent inflation differential with
Euro-area countries, and a further deterioration in competitiveness and the current account.
B. Financial Sector
14.
Slovenia’s banks have so far withstood the global crisis relatively well. The banks
are well capitalized, the level of nonperforming loans is still low, and banks are well
provisioned owing to prudent regulation (Figure 9, Table 4). Foreign ownership is relatively
low. Acting together with other European countries, the authorities responded promptly to the
turmoil with a set of financial measures (Box 3).

9
Box 3: Financial Measures in Response to the Crisis
¾ Unlimited guarantee for all deposits by individuals and small enterprises until end2010;
¾ the provision of up to €12 billion in guarantees on new debt issuance by financial
institutions until end-2010, which is estimated to cover all banks’ foreign refinancing
needs for the next two years;
¾ amendments to the Public Finance Act to empower the government to lend and
provide guarantees to financial institutions, recapitalize banks, and purchase bank
assets;
¾ the issuance of treasury bonds in the amount of €1 billion in January, which were
temporarily deposited with the domestic banking system; and
¾ the announcement of €1.2 billion government guarantees for loans to nonfinancial
companies.

15.
The international credit squeeze has considerably increased the banks’
vulnerability on the liability side. Foreign financing, at about one third of banks’ total
liabilities, of which almost one third is short term, is much higher than in other EU banks.
However, the BoS and staff agreed that banks have maintained adequate liquid assets to cover
their liabilities and could borrow more from the ECB. More pressing is a shortage of
longer-term funding for the financing of loans. The authorities have put in place a contingency
plan, including providing government guarantees for interbank loans, increasing government
deposits in the banking system, and possibly repatriating part of BoS’s foreign assets. The
staff assessed these measures to be adequate to cover the banks’ immediate funding needs but
cautioned that additional public resources may be necessary if the international liquidity
squeeze continues.
16.
On the asset side, rapid credit growth in the past few years and the severe
economic downturn have also increased banks’ credit risk. Household debt, at around
30 percent of GDP, is much lower than the Euro-area average, and there is little sign of a
housing price bubble (Figure 10).4 However, the level of corporate debt (87.5 percent of GDP
in 2008) has approached the Euro-area average. Loan concentration is high. Corporate
vulnerability indicators do not compare well with peers (see table).

So far, the debt service burden is low but nonperforming loans are likely to increase as the
recession deepens. In addition:

See Financial Stability Report (2008).

10
•

Some recent leveraged management buyouts could result in defaults as the value
of the collateral has plummeted. The largest group in trouble owes about
€800 million (2.5 percent of total private sector loans). According to the BoS’s stress
tests, the banking system’s capital adequacy is not at risk. As a precautionary measure,
the BoS has raised the provision requirement for such exposures. However, a failure to
restructure quickly the liabilities of this group could result in the largest bankruptcy in
Slovenia in recent history. While no formal rule appears to have been violated,
enhanced supervisory practices are called for.

•

Possible deterioration of credit made abroad, especially to the Balkans, is another
source of vulnerability. Loans abroad expanded rapidly in recent years but
decelerated sharply in 2008, reaching close to 9 percent of total loans to the
nonbanking sector by end-2008.

17.
The authorities and staff agreed on the need to strengthen the monitoring of
credit risk. In the staff’s view, updated bank-by-bank stress tests are necessary to gauge the
impact of potentially higher nonperforming loans on banks’ capital needs, and the government
should maintain a contingency plan for bank recapitalization. Banks should be encouraged to
maintain precautionary capital buffers against worsening of the portfolio quality. The
authorities should step up coordination with foreign supervisors to monitor potential regional
spillovers. The BoS concurred with staff on the vulnerabilities and stressed that many of these
measures are being taken, including the recommendation of retaining profits and raising
provisions against risky exposures. The authorities also noted that their experience in
recapitalizing banks and restructuring nonperforming assets during the transition is valuable in
dealing with present challenges.
18.
The authorities are considering measures to increase lending to nonfinancial
companies. A second anti-crisis package, which includes auctioning partial state guarantees
on new loans to nonfinancial enterprises of up to €1.2 billion, was announced in February. In
addition, the publicly owned and recently recapitalized Slovene Export and Development
Bank has expanded considerably its portfolio since September. The authorities stressed the
need of ensuring credit to healthy companies. While staff appreciated the benefits of
providing support to viable companies during difficult times, it stressed the need for the
allocation of state guarantees to be transparent and to limit banks’ moral hazard.
C. Fiscal Policy
19.
The authorities and staff concurred that a fiscal stimulus is necessary. The
unprecedented crisis calls for a bold fiscal response to attenuate the drop in aggregate demand
and to alleviate distress of the most vulnerable groups. Staff supported the size of the fiscal
stimulus package (2.1 percent of GDP, Box 4) and projected the fiscal deficit to deteriorate to
4.2 percent of GDP in 2009, reflecting both automatic stabilizers and a fiscal stimulus
package. The MoF indicated their intention to contain the fiscal deficit to 4 percent of GDP in

11
2009, possibly cutting public investment in case the deficit exceeds this threshold. Staff
endorsed this prudent position in light of the necessity to keep fiscal sustainability and rising
borrowing costs.
Box 4: Fiscal Stimulus Package
The government announced a €806 million fiscal stimulus package (equivalent to 2.1 percent
of GDP, of which 1.8 percent will be spent in 2009, 0.2 percent in 2010, and 0.1 percent in
2011) in December 2008 and passed a supplementary budget in March 2009. The main
components of the stimulus package are as follows:
¾ 0.6 percent of GDP in wage subsidies to companies for shorter labor hours;
¾ 0.5 percent of GDP in other subsidies to companies, including for R&D;
¾ 0.6 percent of GDP for the elimination of the payroll tax; and
¾ 0.5 percent of GDP in reduction of corporate taxation.

20.
Views differed on the wage subsidies to shorten working hours included in the
package. The authorities stressed that this measure was targeted at preserving jobs and could
save the payment of unemployment benefits. According to staff, these measures might
provide some relief to workers and medium and large-sized enterprises but were not
sufficiently targeted to the most vulnerable groups; they might entail a risk of abuse and
would be hard to reverse if the crisis continues, causing large fiscal costs. Staff recommended
not to renew these measures and to use the funds for more targeted interventions in case the
crisis continues.
21.
Staff recommended increasing public investment. Public investment could be
leveraged with EU funding and has a direct effect on demand. Moreover, investment is key to
upgrading infrastructure and to increasing potential growth and is, by nature, temporary. The
authorities agreed but noted that institutional bottlenecks had limited absorptive capacity in
the past.
22.
Looking forward, staff stressed that the fiscal position should be reverted to a
more conservative stance as the crisis subsides. Fiscal policy should be tightened as soon as
possible considering the cost of public debt, the fiscal implication of the aging population, and
the contingent liabilities deriving from the financial stability measures. The authorities aim to
reduce the fiscal deficit to below 3 percent of GDP in 2010; however, no plan has been
presented on how to achieve this objective.
23.
The authorities and staff concurred that fiscal adjustment should mainly come
through the consolidation of expenditure. The recent public sector wage agreement will
raise the wage bill substantially over 2009 and 2010. Future increases need to be contained.
Staff welcomed the authorities’ goal of reducing by attrition public employment by 2 percent

12
a year over the next two years and suggested that the government should link the employment
reduction measures to a comprehensive strategy to improve the efficiency of public
expenditure, which would include the introduction of performance budgeting.
24.
The authorities agreed that a rapidly aging population and current policies pose a
challenge for long-term fiscal sustainability, but there is no political consensus for
systemic reforms. The authorities also noted their goal of increasing minimum pension. With
the lowest birth rate in Europe and an aging population, the elderly dependency ratio will
increase to 60 percent in 2030, one of the highest in Europe. In the absence of reforms,
age-related expenditures are projected to increase by 8 to 10 percentage points of GDP and
reach almost 30 percent of GDP by 2050.5 As a solution, the government is considering
greater incentives for a longer working life and private pension savings and active aging
policies aimed at increasing labor participation especially among older workers. In staff’s
view, these measures go in the right direction but are insufficient to ensure long-term
sustainability. Fiscal viability requires systemic reforms, including (partially) de-linking
pensions from wages and increasing the retirement age. A prompt introduction of the pension
reform would also anchor expectations for fiscal consolidation after the crisis.

D. Structural Issues
25.
Staff emphasized that successful competition in the Euro zone requires greater
labor market flexibility. As a consequence of large devaluations in neighboring countries,
Slovenia will face tougher competition, especially in labor-intensive sectors. Labor markets
need to be flexible to facilitate the reallocation of workers from sectors no longer competitive
to new sectors and to contain the wage pressures that were observed after the euro adoption.
To this end, further liberalization of employment protection legislation is necessary in the
medium term and could be implemented in the context of a “flexicurity” approach. The
5

13
authorities stressed that the “flexicurity” model of labor market implies large fiscal costs and
requires further analysis.
26.
Improvements in the product and financial markets are needed to enhance
competitiveness (Figure 11). Slovenian banks are among the least efficient in Europe
(Box 5); Slovenia ranks low among European economies in the World Bank’s Ease of Doing
Business indicators, and has attracted little FDI in the past few years. Among possible causes
are the high government ownership and involvement in the economy, the extent of red tape
and regulations, shortfalls in competition laws and their enforcement, and the lagging
regulation of network industries. To ease business and property registration, the authorities
have adopted several measures, including the introduction of the “one-stop shop” for
companies’ registration. Staff endorsed the government’s program to simplify the regulatory
burden and strengthen judicial enforcement. In staff’s view, further reforms should focus on
enhancing competition in the product and financial markets, including by increasing the
independence of the Competition Protection Office and continuing the privatization process
once the crisis is over.
Box 5. Efficiency of Slovenian Banks
The financial sector remains dominated by domestic, largely state-controlled banks. How well are they
prepared for increasing competition in the integrated European financial markets? A recent paper by
IMF staff finds that Slovenian banks are among the least efficient in Europe, which may reflect the
low contestability compared to EU peers.1
Slovenia tends to lag behind the New Member States (NMS) in cost efficiency, owning to high labor
costs. Profitability is also lower than regional peers, driven by declining net interest margins. The
analysis of scores for bank efficiency and indices for market contestability for Slovenia and its EU
peers shows that Slovenian banks are, on average, less cost efficient than those in the EMU, and
among the least contested in Europe. The Slovenian banking sector is characterized by higher-thanaverage market concentration and state ownership, which could have resulted in low efficiency and
contestability, as suggested by larger cross-country studies.

III. STAFF APPRAISAL
27.
To date, the fiscal and financial policy responses have been broadly appropriate.
Going forward, it is essential that these measures be complemented by broad-ranging reforms
aimed at raising the economy's growth potential and ensuring fiscal sustainability.
28.
Short-term actions are needed to counter the effects of the global crisis. Policies
should focus on attenuating the consequences of the crisis, taking into consideration that the
slowdown may be protracted and the following recovery sluggish. Tight credit markets also
limit the ability to finance fiscal deficits.
29.
In the medium term, the economy needs to emerge from the global crisis on a
sustainable growth path. As the crisis subsides, Slovenia will face new challenges from
tighter international credit conditions, lower potential growth, and neighboring countries with
competitive exchange rates. To address these challenges, reforms in labor, product, and
financial markets are required.
30.
The main long-term challenge comes from the fiscal implications of a rapidly
aging population. The current pension system needs to be reformed to address the imbalance
between the means available and commitments deriving from the current pension provisions
and an aging population.
31.
Vulnerabilities in the banking system have increased and further preventive
actions are in order. Efforts should continue ensuring that the banks have enough funding in
case of further international credit squeeze, especially at longer maturities. Bank-by-bank
stress tests should be performed to gauge the liquidity and capital needs of the banks. The BoS
should encourage vulnerable banks to raise their capital levels. If banks come under stress, the
authorities should be ready to inject public capital into undercapitalized banks, accompanied
by measures to restructure the nonperforming assets and the operation of the affected banks.
32.
The authorities’ priority should be maintaining banks’ stability rather than
expanding further their portfolios given the protracted nature of the crisis. Given the
potential tightness in banks’ capital, there is a trade-off between expanding further banks’
portfolios during the crisis and keeping additional lending capacity for the future. The
authorities announced measures to increase lending to nonfinancial enterprises, including
auctioning partial state guarantees on new loans to nonfinancial enterprises. While staff
appreciates the benefits of providing support to viable companies during difficult times,
caution should be taken to maintain loan quality. The allocation of state guarantees needs to
be transparent, to limit banks’ moral hazard, and to avoid sector picking.
33.
The magnitude of the planned fiscal deficit is appropriate. The severe economic
downturn called for a bold fiscal response, which the authorities have implemented. Looking
forward, the large spread on Slovenian sovereign bonds reminds of the necessity to keep a low

15
level of borrowing. Staff endorses the authorities’ commitment to keep the fiscal deficit at or
below 4 percent and to bring it down further as soon as the crisis subsides.
34.
The composition of the fiscal package could be improved by allocating relatively
more resources to public investment. Public investment increases directly aggregate
demand and can be leveraged with EU funds; public investment is also key to upgrading
infrastructure and increasing potential growth. The authorities should act swiftly to remove
the legal and institutional bottlenecks, which previously hindered the use of EU funds. To this
end, a task force to coordinate the use of EU funds among ministries should be considered.
35.
The fiscal position should be reverted back to a more conservative stance as soon
as a recovery takes hold. The short-term fiscal measures should be embedded into a
long-term fiscal strategy, which highlights the future fiscal liabilities of the pension system
and contingent liabilities owing to the extensive guarantees that the government may issue.
Having a clear deficit reduction strategy coupled with an effective communication framework
will also help in financing the budget.
36.
Systemic changes to the pension system are necessary to ensure longer-term fiscal
sustainability. The measures the government is considering, including greater incentives for a
longer working life and private pension savings, are insufficient to ensure long-term
sustainability and to generate resources to increase minimum pensions. Fiscal sustainability
requires a systemic reform that raises retirement age and/or moderates the indexation
mechanism of the pension benefits. Pensions should not increase to reflect the one-off rise in
wages following the recent public wage agreement.
37.
Structural reforms in the labor, product, and financial markets are imperative to
improve competitiveness. Greater labor participation and flexibility are essential to succeed
in the Euro-area and to face competition from neighboring countries, which have recently
devalued. Staff endorsed the government’s program to simplify the regulatory burden and
strengthen judicial enforcement. Improving the business climate, as well as reviving the
privatization program once the crisis subdues, will boost productivity growth.
38.
It is recommended that Slovenia moves to a 24-month consultation cycle.
Slovenia, being a non-systemic country, with stable economic and financial conditions, and
without outstanding Fund credit or pressing policy issues of broad interest to the Fund
membership, meets the criteria for the 24-month consultation cycle. The authorities agreed to
move the consultations to a 24-month cycle, with an interim staff visit.

For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; Euro deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, Euro deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels
the last projection year.

1/ Derived as [r - g - (1+g) + ⇔(1+r)]/(1+g+ +g ) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; ⇔
= change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms, g = real GDP growth rate,
⇔= nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
increases with an appreciating domestic currency ( ⇔
> 0) and rising inflation
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [- (1+g ⇔
™)
™
 (1+r ⇔
1+g+ +g ) times previous period debt stock. ⇔
(based on GDP deflator).

ANNEX II: SLOVENIA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision is adequate for surveillance purposes.
Special Data Dissemination Standard: Slovenia has subscribed to the Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS), meets SDDS specifications, and its metadata are posted on
the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board on the Internet.
http://dsbb.imf.org/Applications/web/sddscountrycategorylist/?strcode=SVN
Real Sector Statistics: The Statistical Office of the Republic of Slovenia (SORS) follows
the European System of Accounts 1995 (ESA95). Quarterly GDP estimates by industry and
expenditure categories are compiled in both current and constant prices, and are published
within 80 days after the reference quarter. In September 2005, the SORS changed the base
year for compiling constant prices GDP from 2000 to the previous year’s prices and started
using the chain-link index methodology.
The SORS compiles the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for monitoring
compliance with the Maastricht inflation criterion. However, price collection is restricted to
four cities and their surrounding rural areas. The weights are based on the three-year average
of expenditure data for consumer goods from continuous Household Budget Surveys for
2002, 2003, and 2004. It also compiles a retail price index (RPI), which differs from the
consumer price index in weights only.
Government Finance Statistics: Slovenian fiscal statistics are timely and of a high quality.
The ministry of finance publishes a comprehensive monthly Bulletin of Government Finance,
which presents monthly data on the operations of the “state budget” (Budgetary Central
Government), local governments, social security (Pension and Health funds), and the
consolidated general government. The coverage of general government excludes the
operations of extra budgetary funds and own revenues of general government agencies
(zavods). However, these operations are small in size. Monthly fiscal indicators are reported
for publication in IFS on a timely basis and annual statistics covering general government
operations, including the operations of the extra budgetary funds are reported for publication
in the Government Finance Statistic Yearbook (GFS Yearbook).
The data published in the Bulletin of Government Finance are on a cash basis and broadly
use the analytical framework and classification system of the IMF’s 1986 government
finance statistics methodology. The data reported for publication in the GFS Yearbook are
also on a cash basis but are recast in the analytical framework and classifications of the
Manual on Government Finance Statistics 2001(GFSM 2001).
The Slovenian authorities wish to adopt the GFSM 2001 methodology, which could then be
used as a building block for the compilation of the ESA 95-based data jointly by the Ministry
of Finance and the SORS for reporting to the European Commission. To assist the Ministry
of Finance resolve several classification issues and develop a migration path, a STA technical

5
assistance mission visited Ljubljana in April 2006. Pending the approval of the revision of
the law on public finance, Slovenia plans the introduction of a new charts for all public
entities based on GFSM 2001. Nevertheless, accrual principles will not yet be introduced for
preparation, execution, and accounting of the central, local, and social security fund’s
budgets.
Money and Banking Statistics: Monetary statistics are timely and of good quality.
Balance of Payments Statistics: Balance of payments data are comprehensive and of high
quality. The data have been published in the Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook
since 1993 (with estimates of the international investment position published since 1994). In
2002, the Bank of Slovenia revised the balance of payments statistics going back to 1994; the
most significant revisions were related to the income component of the current account and
to the other investment component of the financial account.
External Debt Statistics: External debt statistics were revised and brought in line with the
SDDS in August 2003. The main change comprised the inclusion of trade credits in the debt
data.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on Republic of Slovenia
May 13, 2009

1.
This statement summarizes economic developments and policy action in Slovenia
since issuance of the staff report. The additional information does not change the thrust
of the staff appraisal.
2.
Recently released data confirm that economic activity continued contracting
sharply in the first quarter of 2009. High-frequency indicators worsened compared to the
previous quarter. Industrial production plunged by 21.5 percent year-on-year in February,
while new orders in industry declined by 49.8 percent year-on-year in the first quarter.
Merchandise exports contracted by 25.1 percent year-on-year in February. Consumer and
business confidence indicators dropped to new lows, and the unemployment rate rose to
5.1 percent in the first quarter.
3.
Having reduced their growth estimate to -4 percent in 2009, the authorities are
projecting that the fiscal deficit could exceed 6 percent of GDP without corrective
actions. The government announced a number of budgetary measures to contain the deficit at
5.1 percent in 2009, below 4 percent of GDP in 2010, and below 3.5 percent of GDP in 2011.
The main measures for 2009 include a cut in domestically funded public investment by
0.7 percent of GDP and lower expenditure on the purchase of goods and services by
0.5 percent of GDP. The measures for 2010 and 2011 include also a freeze in pensions, social
transfers, and public sector’s wages.
4.
Staff welcomes the authorities’ commitment to maintain fiscal discipline but
cautions against prematurely withdrawing fiscal stimulus in presence of an increasing
output gap. The announced measures could intensify the downturn in the short term, and
proposed cuts in public investment could be detrimental to medium-term growth prospects.
As discussed in the Staff Report, the proposed measures—which will be useful to rationalize
expenditure—could be embedded in a medium-term plan and tied to the onset of the
recovery.
5.
The financial sector remains under stress, but appears to be comparatively
resilient. Lending conditions remained tight and credit growth continued to decelerate. On a
positive note, the sovereign spread vis-à-vis the German bond has fallen recently. Two large
banks have applied for the government guarantees for debt issuance. The large conglomerate,
which is heavily indebted due to a recent leveraged management buyout, is proceeding with
negotiations with the banks to reach a debt restructuring plan to avoid bankruptcy.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2009 Article IV Consultation with
the Republic of Slovenia
On May 13, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with the Republic of Slovenia. 1
Background
After a period of overheating following the adoption of the euro in 2007, the global crisis
hit Slovenia in the fall of 2008. Manufacturing and trade, and later investment,
decelerated sharply, while private consumption growth moderated. While wage growth
continued to accelerate as wage agreements were implemented, the labor market
cooled in the fall with unemployment increasing to 5.1 percent in the first quarter of
2009. Reflecting a strong pass-through of fuel and food prices, inflation stood at 5.5
percent in 2008, which was significantly above euro-area inflation, but came down to 2.1
in February 2009. The current account continued to deteriorate owing to the overheating
economy, reaching 5.5 percent of GDP in 2008, as did Slovenia’s competitive position.
Consequently, Slovenia’s net external debt rose to 25.4 percent of GDP by the end of
2008.
Output is expected to contract by 2.7 percent in 2009. The main factors driving the
downturn are the deceleration of exports as the Eurozone is in recession, and of
investment as credit conditions tighten and exports decelerate. Private consumption

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities.

should be more resilient because of the recent wage increases and the strong net asset
position of the households. Inflation and the current account deficit are expected to
moderate. The main downward risks to growth are lower-than-projected growth in
Europe, and a credit crunch in the event that foreign financing of domestic banks dries
up.
The government budget was broadly balanced in 2008 with a positive fiscal impulse. In
reaction to the crisis, the authorities have adopted a fiscal stimulus package of
2.1 percent of GDP to attenuate the drop in aggregate demand and to alleviate distress
of the most vulnerable groups. The fiscal deficit is expected to deteriorate to 4.2 percent
of GDP in 2009, reflecting both automatic stabilizers and a fiscal stimulus package. The
government indicated its intention to contain the fiscal deficit to 5 percent of GDP in
2009, possibly cutting public investment in case the deficit exceeds this threshold. Going
forward, the authorities aim to reduce the fiscal deficit to below 4 percent of GDP in
2010. A rapidly aging population and current policies pose a challenge for long-term
fiscal sustainability. As a solution, the government is considering greater incentives for a
longer working life and private pension savings and active aging policies aimed at
increasing labor participation especially among older workers.
Banks weathered relatively well the first impact of the crisis thanks to their limited
exposure to the U.S. financial system, the low level of households’ indebtedness, and
the financial stability measures promptly put in place by the authorities. Nevertheless,
the financial sector is increasingly affected by the global crisis. The international credit
squeeze has considerably increased the banks’ vulnerability on the liability side, given
their high reliance on foreign financing. On the asset side, rapid credit growth in the past
few years and the severe economic downturn have also increased banks’ credit risk.
The authorities have put in place a contingency plan which should help solve banks’
short run funding needs, and recommended banks to retain profits and raise provisions
against risky exposures.
In the medium term, the main challenge is that the economy needs to emerge from the
global crisis on a sustainable growth path. As the crisis subsides, Slovenia will face new
challenges from tighter international credit conditions, lower potential growth, and
neighboring countries with competitive exchange rates. To address these challenges,
comprehensive reforms in labor, product, and financial markets are required.
Executive Board Assessment
The Executive Directors noted that, after a long period of strong economic performance
that allowed a rapid catch-up to EU levels, Slovenia, as a small open economy, is now
severely affected by the global economic crisis. They commended the authorities for
their swift and decisive policy responses to slower growth and financial sector strains.
Looking ahead, Directors stressed that it will be important to press ahead with
broad-ranging reforms aimed at raising the economy’s growth potential, bolstering

3

competitiveness, and ensuring fiscal sustainability, especially in light of the challenges
posed by an aging population.
Directors recognized that the authorities need to strike the right balance between
supporting domestic demand and preserving fiscal sustainability. They welcomed the
authorities’ intention to ensure that the fiscal stimulus measures are temporary,
well-diversified, and targeted to protect the most vulnerable groups. Directors
encouraged the authorities to maintain public investment in infrastructure, while avoiding
generalized increases in public sector wages and wage subsidies to companies for
shorter working hours. Directors suggested that, as recovery takes hold, the fiscal
position should revert to a more prudent stance anchored by the Stability and Growth
Pact. They also supported the authorities’ intentions to tackle longer-term challenges,
such as the fiscal liabilities of the pension system and contingent liabilities owing to the
extensive government guarantees. They recommended systemic changes to the
pension system, and encouraged the authorities to consider bolder reforms, including
raising the retirement age and lowering the pension-to-wages ratio.
Executive Directors noted that the banking sector has so far been relatively resilient,
and welcomed the authorities’ swift measures to respond to the crisis. However, they
cautioned that vulnerabilities have increased, and emphasized that efforts should
continue to ensure that the banks have enough funding in case of a further international
credit squeeze, especially at longer maturities. Updated stress tests should be
performed including in a coordinated manner at the EU level, and the authorities should
be ready to inject public capital into undercapitalized banks, accompanied by measures
to restructure the nonperforming assets and the operation of the affected banks.
Directors advised that the allocation of state guarantees on new loans to nonfinancial
enterprises should be transparent, to limit banks’ moral hazard and avoid unduly
targeting specific sectors.
Directors stressed that structural reforms in the labor, product, and financial markets are
imperative to improve external competitiveness and bolster potential growth. In this
connection, they noted the staff’s estimate of a modest external competitiveness gap,
owing to rising unit labor costs and depreciations in the currencies of neighboring
countries. Addressing this gap will require greater labor participation and flexibility, along
with wage moderation as well as other reforms aimed at boosting productivity. Directors
endorsed the government’s program to simplify the regulatory burden, strengthen
judicial enforcement, enhance the business climate, and revive the privatization program
once the crisis subdues.

Statement by Johann Prader, Alternate Executive Director for Republic of
Slovenia and Ksenija Maver, Advisor to Executive Director
May 13, 2009
The Slovene authorities thank the staff for the productive and stimulating Article IV
discussions. They broadly concur with the staff's assessments of economic developments in
Slovenia and the challenges that it faces.
Global crisis imposing a heavy toll
Slovenia was experiencing solid growth and a strong fiscal position, supported by buoyant
investment and exports, before the global economy entered the current crisis. An annual
inflation of 5.7 percent in 2008 and a widening current account deficit of 5.5 percent of GDP
were a concern, although considered manageable over time in light of the monetary
integration and rapid convergence processes. However, a sudden drop in external demand
and foreign financing, associated with spillovers to domestic demand, were a strong shock to
the economy with an export share in GDP of about 70 percent.
Designing the response
The authorities acted swiftly to deal with the adverse effects of the crisis with three sets of
measures. First, provide liquidity to banks and enterprises. Second, safeguard production and
jobs. Third, soften the impact of the crisis and restore medium-term fiscal sustainability. The
fiscal stimulus package amounts to 2.1 percent of GDP, of which 1.8 percent would be spent
in 2009. If necessary, the government will scale up the fiscal support in 2010, depending on
the evolution of the national and regional situation. The first two sets of measures are already
in effect, while the third is set for formal approval by mid-May.
The above measures were based on the following three principles. The measures should be
(i) temporary, (ii) diversified, and (iii) tailored to Slovenia’s fiscal space and anchored to a
credible medium-term fiscal framework. Given the limited economic options for a small and
open economy, the timing and pace of a sustained turnaround will depend mainly on actions
to stabilize financial conditions and boost demand in Slovenia's main trading partners.
The global crisis has hit Slovenia’s economy hard but it will leave the country better
prepared for the future. The first two sets of measures are primarily aimed at counteracting
the effects of the crisis. But the third set is more development-oriented. It includes proposals
for medium- and long-term structural reforms, such as performance budgeting, expenditure
rationalization in public institutions, modernization of the pension system, and changes in
social expenditures. It also includes short-term measures in the field of employment, social
protection and business environment, such as subsidies for workers made temporarily
redundant and waiting for re-employment, training programs, active employment policies, a
trade financing facility, “green tax reform”, public procurement rationalization, etc. The
authorities also introduced measures aimed at increasing the efficiency of using the EU
cohesion funds for public investments.

Credit growth has declined
The banking sector continues to be well capitalized and liquid, but credit growth has
declined. Difficulties in borrowing abroad, lower demand for credit and reluctance of banks
to lend in the uncertain economic environment have contributed to a slowdown in credit
activity, to 13.3 percent y-o-y in March, down from an average annual growth of 20 percent
recorded over the past few years, and a peak of 40 percent in 2007.
The banks’ funding structure is changing. By making net repayments of foreign borrowing,
banks are substituting foreign funding (which backs about one third of the banks’ credit
exposure) by government deposits (from the EUR 1 billion government bond issue) and
Eurosystem liquidity. Nevertheless, foreign parent banks continue to provide funding to their
banks in Slovenia. In the same vein, Slovenian banks are determined to keep the linkages
with their subsidiaries in the region strong and provide additional capital to them if needed.
Possible rebound, but still contraction in 2009
Recent preliminary data for Slovenia, as for Europe and other parts of the world, suggest that
the pace of contraction may be slowing, and that a recovery is on the horizon.
Notwithstanding this, the economy is expected to record a sharp decline in economic activity
in 2009. The government projects a decline of 4 percent, the European Commission of
3.4 percent, the IMF of 2.7 percent, and the Bank of Slovenia of 2 percent. For 2010,
projections show a slightly positive economic growth in the range of 0.7 to 1.9 percent,
driven by stronger exports and increased investments in motorways and railway
infrastructure.
Public finances are also deteriorating, reflecting the weakening economy, the cost of the
fiscal stimulus package and the effects of changes in tax and expenditure legislation
approved in 2007. The government is now preparing a second supplementary budget for
2009 that projects a widening of the general government deficit to 5.1 percent of GDP, or
1.4 percentage points more than envisaged in the first supplementary budget adopted in
March. Cuts in investments, material expenditures and services are being planned in order to
prevent the deficit from reaching 6 percent of GDP, a level the government considers
unsustainable. The public debt to GDP ratio will increase from the current 23 percent to
36 percent by 2011. The general government deficit is expected to decline to 3.9 percent of
GDP in 2010 and to 3.4 percent in 2011.
Other economic indicators also reflect the impact of the crisis. The current account deficit is
expected to narrow this year by around 2 percentage points to 3.2 percent of GDP, due to
lower imports and improved terms of trade. Inflation has moderated to 1.8 percent y-o-y in
March. Unemployment is rising, especially in manufacturing, and is currently at 6 percent
and trending towards 7 percent. As a result, the wage growth in the private sector has slowed.
In the public sector, however, real wage growth in 2009 is currently projected at 6.2 percent,
reflecting agreements with social partners, reached last August, on a gradual elimination of
wage disparities.

3
Development policy priorities and challenges
Key elements of Slovenia’s development policy have been set by the 2008 Reform Program
for Achieving Lisbon Strategy Goals, the government’s anti-crisis measures and the Stability
Program approved at the end of April. The priority is to pursue policies that will foster
economic growth underpinned by sustainable public finances. Slovenia’s growth prospects
will depend very much on its ability to reduce the competitiveness gap, keep the external and
internal accounts in check and contain public sector wage growth. It will also depend on how
soon the banking sector will resume lending activities.
In the short run, further steps are planned in the following areas:
• Quality of public finance. Introduction of performance budgeting in the 2010–2011
budget cycle is aimed to improve prioritization, resource allocation and performance
measurement. Rationalization of social transfers and other expenditures is also in the
pipeline.
• Pension system. The plan is to finalize the proposals for modernizing the pension
system by autumn, and to agree with the social partners on the main elements by the end of
this year, including on solutions for the population to remain active longer, active aging,
life-long learning, etc.
• Public sector wage policy. Negotiations with social partners on adjusting collective
wage agreements for the public sector are also being planned.
• Business environment and labor market policy. Promoting investments in R&D,
stimulating R&D cooperation between the research community and the economy, increasing
labor market flexibility, and reducing administrative barriers also top the development
agenda.
The task ahead is certainly not easy, in particular as it involves important trade-offs and
social consensus. Slovenia’s experience with transition, EU accession and Euro adoption
proves that at the critical juncture the momentum does build up to move things forward.
