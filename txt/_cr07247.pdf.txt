THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA
Staff Report for the 2007 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2007 Consultation with
The Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia
Approved by Siddharth Tiwari and Carlo Cottarelli
May 18, 2007
• Last Article IV consultation. The 2005 Article IV consultation pointed out the pressure
building on Ethiopia’s balance of payments from persistently high world oil prices and
increases in public sector investment. Executive Directors cautioned that scaling up
domestically financed investments jeopardized macroeconomic stability. They therefore
welcomed the expenditure cuts that were introduced and the authorities’ commitment to
take additional measures to protect international reserves. Directors also noted that a
tighter fiscal and monetary stance might be required to contain demand and to stabilize the
balance of payments. The Ethiopian authorities have been broadly responsive to Fund
advice, albeit with delay in some instances and somewhat tepid intensity.
• Backdrop of mission. Uncertainty regarding donor assistance remains high. Because of
concerns about political governance, donors had suspended their budget support when
unrest erupted after the May 2005 elections. However, support has recently been
increasing through the Protection of Basic Services operation (supported by the World
Bank and other donors). In December 2006, the Ethiopian government dispatched its
troops to Somalia to support the Somali transitional government. Though this action
initially raised additional concerns, no major economic impact has so far been reported.
• Exchange rate. The authorities describe their de jure exchange rate regime as a managed
float with no predetermined path for the exchange rate. However, in light of the relative
stability in the rate as well as the authorities’ intervention policy, the exchange rate regime
has de facto been akin to a conventional peg, although recently exchange rate flexibility
has increased somewhat.
• Participants. Discussions were held February 23–March 9, 2007. The mission met with
Prime Minister Meles Zenawi, Minister of Finance and Economic Development Sufian
Ahmed, Central Bank Governor Teklewold Atnafu, senior officials, and representatives of
civil society and the donor community. The mission team consisted of Messrs. Itam, Doré,
and Honda, Ms. Lu (all AFR), and Mr. Thomas (PDR). Mr. Peraza (STA) joined the
mission to work with the officials on the Statistical Appendix and Ms. Majaha-Jartby
(MCM) joined it to help enhance financial surveillance. Mr. Schwidrowski (Senior
Resident Representative) assisted the mission. Messrs. Kamara and Kanu (OED) attended
most of the meetings. Messrs. Kato and Gerson (OMD) participated in the final round. The
mission collaborated with the World Bank Resident Mission in Addis Ababa and was
joined by a staff member from the African Development Bank (AfDB).

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Focus of the report: The discussions for the 2007 Article IV consultation focused on the
policy requirement for (i) addressing current macroeconomic imbalances (rising inflation and
low official international reserves); and (ii) preserving medium-term macroeconomic
stability while fostering growth potential.
Background: The economy has been enjoying a buoyant expansion since the drought-related
contraction in 2002/03.1 Real GDP rebounded to an annual average growth rate of
10.7 percent for 2003/04 through 2005/06—significantly above the average of 5.8 percent for
sub-Saharan Africa. Although agriculture continues to be the mainstay of the economy, the
recent expansion has been broad-based, with manufacturing, construction, and services
making significant contributions. However, inflation has accelerated. It reached 19 percent in
February 2007. Official international reserves have fallen below 2 months of import
coverage. Expansion of domestic credit has continued to be brisk, reflecting a pick-up in
private sector economic activity and increasingly negative real interest rates.
Challenges: While the economic outlook seems favorable with strong macro policy
implementation, there are significant risks. There is very little margin for policy slippages if
economic stability is to be maintained, adverse weather may recur, structural bottlenecks and
constraints persist, and the environment is not yet fully conducive to private sector-led
growth. A critical challenge for Ethiopia is to strike a judicious balance between demanddampening measures and growth-enhancing structural reforms.
The authorities’ views: The authorities give macroeconomic stability a high priority, though
they reiterate the need to maintain the current growth momentum. They shared staff concerns
about inflation and low official international reserves and recognized the adverse impact they
have, particularly on the urban poor and on business confidence, while the authorities favor a
more gradual approach in some policy areas (in terms of monetary tightening and exchange
rate flexibility) than the staff.
Staff views: Staff encouraged the authorities to make forceful fiscal adjustments (some new
revenue measures and cuts in nonpriority expenditures) and support them with a tighter
monetary policy and greater exchange rate flexibility to ease demand pressures and start to
push inflation downward. They also stressed the importance of addressing emerging supply
constraints and the limited implementation and absorptive capacities of the economy, and of
establishing a sound, dynamic, and competitive financial sector.

I. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
1.
The economy has enjoyed strong and steady growth for the past three years
(Table 1). After a significant drought-related contraction in 2002/03, it rebounded with an
annual average growth rate of 10.7 percent for 2003/04–2005/06—significantly above the
average of 5.8 percent realized in sub-Saharan Africa. As a result, real per capita income
increased at an annual average of 7 percent—the fastest rate in Ethiopia’s recent history.
Although agriculture continued to be dominant, the expansion has been broad-based, with
significant contributions from manufacturing, construction, and services.

Unfortunately, as growth rebounded, inflation rose. While inflation was less than
10 percent for most of 2003/04–2004/05, it accelerated in mid-2005 and reached 18.5 percent
at the end of 2006. The surge in food prices reflected higher disposable income and some
supply-side factors: (i) farmers were able to supply agricultural produce more uniformly over
the year (after improvements in access to credit, storage facilities, marketing information,
and incomes), which helped avoid excess supply during harvesting seasons; and (ii) the total
supply of cereals fell after some

Public finances deteriorated in 2004/05–2005/06 (Tables 2 and 3). After declining
to 0.2 percent of GDP in 2003/04, net domestic borrowing to finance the budget rose to 3.1
percent of GDP in 2005/06 as the domestic revenue effort declined and donors significantly
reduced budget support (a shortfall of 2 percentage points of GDP from what was budgeted).
Consequently, though expenditures were scaled down from the original budget by postponing
large-scale infrastructure projects and constraining recurrent outlays, the overall budget
deficit (including grants) was large, about 4½ percent of GDP a year for 2004/05–2005/06.
4.
Monetary conditions were accommodative (Table 4). Broad money grew relatively
fast in 2005 and 2006, mainly driven by credit expansion to both government and
nongovernment sectors. Demand for bank credit rose sharply to finance large-scale
investment projects by public enterprises and the rapidly expanding private sector. To some
extent, private demand for credit was spurred by the substantial negative real interest rates.
With nominal lending rates averaging 8.6 percent, loan demand—especially for housing
construction and consumer durables—shot up. At the same time, the excess reserves of
commercial banks, which are not remunerated, also fueled the rapid expansion of credit.

With rising domestic demand, particularly for imported raw material and
capital goods, the external current account deficit (after official grants) widened to 10½
percent of GDP in 2005/06. Although there was steady growth in exports of goods, mainly
agricultural products, and services, imports rose even faster. Even though the capital account
surplus (including substantial errors and omissions suspected to be unrecorded inward
remittances) nearly doubled, the overall balance of payments moved from a significant
surplus in 2003/04 to a cumulative deficit equivalent to 2 percent of GDP for 2004/05–
2005/06, a result in part of the shortfall in donor budget support. Gross official international
reserves therefore declined from the equivalent of 3.7 months of imports at the end of
2003/04 to 2.1 months of imports at the end of 2005/06.

The official exchange rate for the Birr against the U.S. dollar (the intervention
currency) was relatively stable despite the widening external imbalances; it stood at Birr
8.78 to the dollar at the end of 2006. The parallel market rate moved within a narrow range.2
With domestic prices rising rapidly, the real effective exchange rate appreciated by 6 percent
in 2006. However, because export prices are fixed in foreign currency and relative price
shifts take time to influence supply, the appreciation may have only moderated the export
growth in recent years though there has been some substitution of imports for domestic
goods.

The economy continues to grow relatively fast, with a little easing of pressures on

major investments in infrastructure and growing private consumption. Inflation is projected
to decline only to about 15 percent at the end of 2006/07, despite the completion of the passthrough of fuel price increases and full adoption by farmers of the new pattern for food
supply. After a period of relative stability, the depreciation of the birr against the U.S. dollar
has in recent months become more pronounced.
8.
The fiscal stance in 2006/07 is now expected to be tighter than originally
envisaged. The authorities had originally planned for a net domestic borrowing of about
4 percent of GDP but the final budget reduced the amount to less than 3 percent. To help
contain pressures on prices and the external position, the authorities are reducing recurrent
expenditures, particularly those not affecting the poor, stretching out large capital outlays,
and have introduced import surcharges to raise revenues. As a result, the overall deficit is
projected at 4.3 percent of GDP, and net domestic financing of the budget would be limited
to 2½ percent of GDP, which the staff believe to be feasible

The external position is expected to strengthen somewhat in 2006/07 (Table 5).
Export growth, led by coffee and horticulture, is projected to combine with substantial
increases in official transfers as relations with donors normalize, reducing the current account
deficit by about half, to 5.6 percent of GDP. The overall balance of payments is projected to
register a surplus of 2.1 percent of GDP, raising gross official international reserves to the
equivalent of 2.2 months of imports by the end of 2006/07.

8
II. POLICIES TO ADDRESS MACROECONOMIC IMBALANCES
10.
Despite strong growth in recent years, there are significant concerns about
inflation and low international reserves. Inflation has risen virtually continuously since
early 2006, hitting 19 percent in February 2007 (the latest data available). At the same time,
official reserves have been declining, mainly because disbursements of external assistance
have been delayed. The authorities concurred with the staff that the impact of inflation,
particularly on the urban poor, is very heavy and efforts should be made to bring it down.
Their main objective is to consolidate macroeconomic stability while maintaining growth
momentum over the medium term; the intention is to reduce inflation to single digits and
build international reserves to 10–12 weeks of import coverage. However, the authorities
argued that the factors contributing to the high inflation should be studied further before
taking additional policy actions. The staff cautioned that action was needed promptly to
prevent expectations of high inflation from becoming entrenched. In particular, the staff
stressed that remedial actions to address macroeconomic imbalances should be based on
prudent fiscal and monetary policies and a more flexible exchange rate.
11.
Fiscal policy should help contain pressures on prices and international reserves
and crowd in the private sector. There was agreement that fiscal policy should be anchored
in net domestic borrowing by the government. The authorities concurred with staff that the
appropriate level over the medium term should be 2–2½ percent in order to (i) release
resources to the private sector over the medium term, while ensuring a gradual decline in
overall money growth to help contain inflation pressures, (ii) contain demand pressures and
mitigate impacts on the external position, and (iii) gradually reduce domestic debt, providing
the flexibility to respond to shocks, particularly climatic shocks that may call for additional
expenditures. To achieve these targets, nonessential recurrent outlays should be further
streamlined, with adequate provision for operations and maintenance. Selection criteria for
capital projects should emphasize productivity and contribution to growth; noncritical
projects with high import content should be avoided. In this context, the authorities noted that
expenditures (particularly on capital goods) would be reduced in case of a shortfall in
revenue collection. Efforts to mobilize more domestic revenue should complement the
expenditure measures. The yield from the new surcharge on imports and other measures
under consideration should raise tax revenue from just under 17 percent of GDP in 2005/06
to about 18 percent a year over the medium term, which would be roughly comparable to
other countries in the region.3 Nevertheless, vigilance is necessary to prevent the erosion in
tax revenue that occurred in the last two years.
12.
Monetary policy should be directed to achieving the inflation and international
reserves targets, but this will require more effective instruments. Currently, the
authorities rely on direct instruments, such as ceilings on domestic credit to the government.
The efficacy of indirect instruments like open market operations with treasury bills has been
Effective April 11, 2007, a surtax (10 percent of CIF value) was imposed on some imported
consumer goods (excluding items for basic needs).

Box 1. Ethiopia: Excess Reserves in Commercial Banks
As of December 2006, bank
reserves exceeded the required level
(5 percent of deposits) by about 14
percentage points. The state-owned
Commercial Bank of Ethiopia
(CBE) holds a disproportionately
large amount. Reserves rose sharply
in mid-2004, while the overall
liquid assets of commercial banks
were kept almost constant during
2002–2006. This reflected the shift
from issuing treasury bills to central
bank financing in 2004/05.

level.

diluted significantly because of structural rigidities, such as the substantial excess cash
reserves of commercial banks (see box 1). There was agreement on the need to rely more on
indirect instruments for monetary policy in the medium term; staff recommended reinforcing
the recent effort to mop up excess cash reserves through the sale of longer-term securities,
facilitating the interbank market (to better allocate the resources to banks in need), and
promoting a more efficient and competitive financial sector. The staff also argued that a
gradual move to positive real interest rates, starting with a sizeable upfront increase in the
minimum deposit rate above the current 3 percent, in combination with the effort to reduce
excess reserves, is needed to contain inflationary pressures.

10
13.
Continued depletion of international reserves in recent months has prompted the
monetary authorities to take measures to defend the level of official reserves. They have
issued directives promoting inward remittances and foreign currency deposits, and are
enforcing the surrender requirement for receipts from tourists and exports of flowers.
Exporters have been given easier access to domestic financing. The staff argued that a more
enduring measure would be to allow the exchange rate—which appears to be overvalued—to
adjust more rapidly, noting the cumulative real appreciation of about 20 percent since early
2005 (see box 2). This should be supplemented with restraints to moderate import demand by
the public sector, including rephasing large infrastructure projects.
14.
The authorities describe the de jure exchange rate regime in Ethiopia as a
managed float with no predetermined path for the exchange rate. The interventions of
NBE in the foreign exchange market have been used primarily to supply foreign exchange in
virtually fixed amounts at regular intervals. Nevertheless, the staff observed that the Birr has
been relatively stable against the U.S. dollar, and that the NBE supplies foreign exchange to
the market based on plans established at the beginning of each fiscal year that take into
account estimates of likely supply and demand. These plans—in particular the exchange rate
path—are not modified when demand or supply conditions change, which means the de facto
exchange rate regime has been until recently akin to a conventional peg. However, in the last
few months, the exchange rate has been appropriately allowed to depreciate somewhat faster.
15.
The authorities agreed that the relatively stable nominal exchange rate may not
enhance growth over the medium term, and noted that the real appreciation in recent
years should be reversed in an orderly and gradual manner. In this regard, the staff is of
the view that the immediate priority is to allow the exchange rate to depreciate more rapidly
within the context of the de jure regime of a managed float. In the circumstances of the
economy—with severe deficiencies in data that impede a precise calculation of the long-term
equilibrium exchange rate, and needing substantial structural reforms for a more competitive
environment—this regime may be appropriate to reflect the evolving fundamental conditions.
16.
The authorities reiterated their policy of relying on grants and concessional
loans (consistent with international terms for concessionality) to finance development.
Recognizing the risks of an unsustainable debt burden, they stressed their commitment to use
wisely the fiscal space provided by recent debt relief (HIPC, MDRI, and bilateral), guided by
the IMF/World Bank Debt Sustainability framework. This approach will apply to both
traditional and nontraditional lenders. In particular, they will exercise great caution in
contracting or guaranteeing new loans.

11
Box 2. Ethiopia: Exchange Rate Assessment
Various assessments suggest that the real exchange rate is overvalued, although the magnitude of the
misalignment varies. The current account deficit (net of current transfers) at over 10 percent of GDP in 2005/06
was at its highest level for over a decade, and the net present value (NPV) of external debt in relation to exports
is projected to double over the next decade. Moreover, the international reserves coverage (measured in terms of
months of imports) is at the lowest level in several years.
Also, recent econometric estimates suggest that the real exchange rate has risen considerably above its
equilibrium level. Gilmour and Chudik (2007) argued that the real exchange rate in Ethiopia is cointegrated
with the terms of trade, openness (measured as the ratio of imports and exports to GDP), productivity relative to
its major trading partners, and government consumption in relation to GDP. Since 2003, when the real exchange
rate was estimated to be in equilibrium, the real exchange rate has appreciated considerably reflecting a growing
disparity between Ethiopian and trading partner inflation rates. Moreover, the equilibrium exchange rate has
depreciated with upward pressure on the equilibrium REER from better terms of trade and increased
government consumption more than offset by downward pressure on the real exchange rate from increased
openness. As a result, based on this approach, the real exchange rate would be currently about 25 percent above
its equilibrium value.
On the other hand, the level of the real effective exchange rate in 2006 was only about 5 percentage points
above the average over the previous ten years. Similarly, the parallel market premium, which averaged some
3½ percentage points during mid-2005–late 2006, is currently only about 1½ percentage points.

III. ENHANCING GROWTH
17.
The authorities affirmed their objective of achieving the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs)4 through Ethiopia’s Program for Accelerated and
4

Progress in achieving the MDGs is summarized in Table 6.

12
Sustainable Development to End Poverty (PASDEP).5 They are aiming at a minimum
average annual growth rate of 7 percent over the medium term, stating that, given recent
growth performance, even 10 percent was within reach. The strategy to achieve growth
centers on boosting economic activity by commercializing agriculture and fostering the
nonfarm private sector. The authorities emphasized that their policies must concentrate on
removing obstacles to growth, stimulating private sector development (with special attention
to the investment climate), and building the financial sector.
18.
In the discussions there was a general consensus on the main obstacles to
growth. Macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability were recognized as prerequisites for
strong, sustainable growth, but progress will be limited unless the emerging supply
constraints are addressed expeditiously and implementation and absorptive capacities are
expanded. Staff pointed to the recent shortage of cement and semiskilled labor as indications
of supply constraints that could only be relaxed with continued structural reforms and with
training. Other constraints identified are (i) land access (i.e., the availability of land,
variations in leasing regulations between regions, pricing of land-use rights, and inability to
use land as collateral); (ii) limited access to financing (mainly long-term), in part caused by
the limited capacity of domestic banks and the paucity of financial instruments; and (iii) high
transportation costs because the country is landlocked and the road network is severely
inadequate.
19.
Private sector development is in its infancy, reflecting the continuing transition
to a market economy. Though recent positive developments, such as the resumption of
privatization and an easing of the regulatory burden, are welcome, more needs to be done.6
To create an environment conducive to private sector activity and to foster growth, the
authorities, with staff endorsement, plan to focus on improving the investment climate,
building the financial sector, and promoting trade openness:
•

An investment climate assessment (ICA) study identified obstacles to private
sector growth, among them cumbersome licensing requirements, rigid labor market
regulations, costly property registration, lengthy export and import procedures, and
the high cost of enforcing contracts (see box 3). The authorities pointed out that they
have made progress in these areas: They have introduced a one-stop-shop to facilitate
operations by new investors; established the Investors Advisory Council to allow
regular consultations with the private sector; adopted an investment code that grants
incentives; and passed business-friendly tax reform. Nevertheless, staff noted, foreign
direct investment in Ethiopia is among the lowest in the region, and further efforts
may be needed to ease the cost of doing business, starting with provision of
information on a timely basis.
The authorities formally submitted this updated PRSP to the World Bank and the Fund on May 7, 2007.

In 2005/06, for example, the share of private investment in the country was about 11 percent, virtually
unchanged from the early 1990s; the contribution of the secondary sector to real GDP amounted to only
11 percent; and the value added in industry was still dominated by public enterprises.

13
Box 3. Ethiopia: Ease of Doing Business
Ethiopia is ranked high on most indicators of ease of doing business in sub-Saharan Africa. This partly reflects
recent efforts to improve administrative efficiency, including implementation of Business Process
Reengineering (BPR) by the Ethiopian Investment Commission that has reduced the procedures and time
needed to secure an investment license.
Yet Ethiopia is ranked 118th in the index of protecting investors, making it sixth among seven countries in the
region. It is ranked 146th on registering property and 149th on trading across borders, lower than the regional
average. From these perspectives, the business environment, as well as a low human capital stock, may thus
explain the low level of foreign direct investment (1.6 percent of GDP in 2002–06) in Ethiopia compared to the
regional average (3.3 percent of GDP).

A sound, dynamic, and competitive financial sector is essential to promote
growth and reduce poverty by mobilizing savings and allocating resources
efficiently. Considerable progress has been made in recent years. The authorities laid
out their strategy for improving the quality of bank portfolios, which would enhance
banking supervision and advocate risk-based management of credit.7 The staff
supported the strategy, reiterating the importance of preparing the financial system for
greater integration into the international financial system. It urged the authorities to
increase competition in banking to improve the efficiency of monetary policy. While
the current capacity-building program with the World Bank will make a significant
contribution, the authorities should consider the merits of undertaking reform of the
financial sector on the basis of a comprehensive developmental FSAP.

•

Trade openness and integration are fundamental to Ethiopia’s development
strategy. The staff welcomed Ethiopia’s plan for future WTO accession. Expanding
agricultural exports could help to broaden the export base and contribute to reducing
rural poverty The authorities noted that preferences available under the U.S. African
Growth and Opportunity Act would stimulate the development of nontraditional
exports. As a step toward meaningful tariff reduction, staff recommended that the

See Annex on the Soundness of the Banking System.

14
authorities consider lowering, or merging at a lower level, the top two tariff bands;
the resulting revenue losses could be significantly reduced by removing some of the
exemptions that give rise to widespread distortions.
•

Raising agricultural productivity is crucial to generating sustained increases in
growth. The PASDEP calls for a range of public investment and services to
(i) expand investments in farm-to-market roads; (ii) encourage private sector
involvement; (iii) build agricultural credit markets; and (iv) enhance the security of
land tenure. Staff stressed the need for a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation
mechanism to assess progress with, and the impact of, reforms being undertaken in
collaboration with the World Bank and the AfDB.
IV. MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK, RISKS, AND CHALLENGES

20.
Based on the above-mentioned policy intentions of the authorities, preliminary
staff projections indicate that the medium-term economic outlook for Ethiopia is
favorable. Real GDP growth will average about 7½ percent a year for 2007/08– 2010/11,
inflation is targeted to trend gradually toward single-digits, and gradual replenishment of
gross official international reserves is expected to bring import coverage to about the 10–12
week target as the balance of payments improves (Table 7). The authorities feel that, given
recent strong performance, these medium-term projections of the main macroeconomic
variables should be considered conservative and prudent.

21.
This baseline medium-term scenario reflects the government’s intention of
reinforcing the foundations for growth to achieve the MDGs and meet PASDEP targets.
The strategy incorporated into the projections centers on consolidating

15
macroeconomic stability while commercializing agriculture to boost economic activity and
fostering the nonfarm private sector.
Although the macroeconomic objectives and the strategy laid out are
appropriate, there are considerable downside risks to the medium-term outlook. There
is little margin for policy slippages, adverse weather may recur, structural constraints that are
emerging would be addressed promptly, and the environment for private sector–led growth is
far from fully supportive. A critical challenge for Ethiopia is to strike a judicious balance
between demand-dampening measures and growth-enhancing structural economic reforms in
order to consolidate macroeconomic stability.
22.

23.
An alternative medium-term scenario, which assumes no policy efforts to
address the macroeconomic imbalances and to enhance growth, shows output growth
declining to about 5½ percent a year by 2010/11. That may not be sufficient to reach the
MDGs. Private investment would decline if reforms to improve the business climate do not
progress. The overall fiscal deficit would increase to over 7 percent of GDP by 2010/11 if
there are no further revenue-enhancing measures. Slackened policy intensity over the
medium term would also contribute to pressures on prices and the balance of payments;
inflation would stay above 15 percent; and official international reserves would fall to the
equivalent of 1.3 month of imports.

24.
The debt sustainability analysis was updated jointly with World Bank staff on
the basis of the baseline medium-term scenario and taking into account MDRI debt
relief from the Fund, the World Bank, and the AfDB (see Supplement). While external
debt ratios have improved considerably with debt relief, the analyses show a moderate risk of
debt distress based on stress tests. Therefore, securing grant and concessional financing

16
And containing domestic borrowing are vital if debt is to stay sustainable over the medium to
long term. Staff urged the authorities to draw up a comprehensive public debt strategy that
specifically includes public enterprise debt and contingent liabilities, and to strengthen debt
management capacity.
25.
Data shortcomings continue to affect analysis of economic developments. The
shortcomings were most prominent in national accounts (where statistical discrepancy was
10 percent of GDP in 2005/06), balance of payments (where errors and omissions were
equivalent to 32 percent of exports in 2005/06), and fiscal accounts (where unidentified
financing reached 1.6 percent of GDP in 2005/06). The mission encouraged further efforts to
improve the quality of data, including with technical assistance from donors and the Fund. In
this regard, addressing the high turnover of relevant staff, defining priorities, and improving
inter-agency coordination are key elements for ensuring the sustainability of statistical
reform.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
26.
The recent growth performance in Ethiopia has been encouraging, but there are
incipient macroeconomic imbalances. Growth exceeded what was envisaged in the
authorities’ poverty reduction strategy, which has apparently helped significantly in reducing
poverty and ultimately achieving the MDGs. Nevertheless, the recent surge in prices and
dwindling official international reserves do not augur well for consolidating macroeconomic
stability over the medium term.
27.
Fully aware of the risks, the authorities are attempting to address them. They
have given high priority to maintaining macroeconomic stability while reiterating the need to
maintain growth momentum. Their main macroeconomic objectives over the medium term
are therefore to keep growth on the current trajectory, push inflation downward to the single
digits, and gradually replenish official international reserves.
28.
Achieving these objectives will require a constellation of policies to restrain
domestic demand, particularly in the public sector, and intensify structural reforms.
The tightening of the fiscal stance in 2006/07 relative to the initial budget plans is therefore
welcome. It incorporates new revenue measures and close monitoring of expenditures to
stretch out some large projects and cut low-priority outlays, but it safeguards povertyreducing and growth-enhancing spending. Over the medium term, it was agreed that fiscal
policy needs to be anchored in net domestic borrowing by the government, which should be
constrained to ensure debt sustainability and better crowd in the private sector as it takes a
more prominent role in economic development.
29.
Monetary and exchange rate policies should focus on achieving the inflation and
international reserves targets. In the absence of effective indirect instruments, the
authorities have relied on direct instruments, which have not been effective in curbing credit
growth given the excess reserves in the banking system. However, the shift to indirect
instruments for monetary policy would depend essentially on (i) the development of an

17
institutional framework for active open market operations; (ii) reforms in the financial sector
to facilitate intermediation, strengthen risk-based management and supervision, and improve
the environment for competition; and (iii) success in mopping up excess cash reserves in the
banking system. A cautious approach toward interest rate flexibility while structural changes
are underway is understandable, but monetary policy should be tightened significantly to
keep high-inflation expectation from becoming entrenched. Furthermore, the authorities
should consider the merits of undertaking financial sector reforms within the framework of a
developmental FSAP.
30.
The authorities’ intention to give the exchange rate more flexibility is welcome.
The immediate priority should be to allow the exchange rate to depreciate more rapidly
within the context of the de jure regime of a managed float. Structural reforms also are
necessary to improve productivity and efficiency so as to strengthen external
competitiveness. Under the current circumstances, including with severe deficiencies in data
that impede a precise calculation of an equilibrium exchange rate, staff is of the view that the
current regime is appropriate to reflect the evolving fundamental conditions.
31.
A critical medium-term challenge for Ethiopia now is to accelerate structural
reforms to buttress sustainable growth. The authorities are accurate in their perception that
emerging supply constraints can only be relaxed with continued structural reforms. They
should therefore continue to focus on improving the investment climate, strengthening the
financial sector, and promoting trade openness.
32.
Based on the authorities’ current policy intentions, the prospects are favorable
for addressing incipient macroeconomic imbalances and maintaining growth
momentum over the medium term. Real GDP would continue to grow relatively fast
through 2010/11, inflation should begin to trend downward, and gross official international
reserves should gradually be replenished but there is no room for policy slippages. While
there is space for new borrowing, Ethiopia must continue to seek concessional financing and
design a borrowing strategy that incorporates long-term repayment obligations. The outlook
has downside risks, such as slippages in macroeconomic policies and failure to intensify
structural reforms to address bottlenecks and encourage private sector–led growth. By
threatening macroeconomic stability these risks would cast a shadow over Ethiopia’s growth
prospects and the likelihood of achieving the MDGs.
33.
The data provided to the Fund are adequate for surveillance purposes, but
major weaknesses persist and further steps should be taken to address the
shortcomings in real, fiscal, and balance of payments statistics without delay. Steppedup efforts, with technical assistance from various sources (including the Fund), are called for.
In the meantime, the authorities should be commended for taking the responsibility to
compile and publish the statistical appendix for Article IV consultations as part of a pilot
project launched by Fund staff.
34.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month
cycle.

APPENDIX. ETHIOPIA: BANKING SYSTEM SOUNDNESS
A. Background
Banks are the major financial intermediary institutions in Ethiopia. There are 8 commercial
banks (2 state-owned and 6 private) and a development bank (the National Development
Bank of Ethiopia (DBE)). The microfinance sector (27 institutions) is expanding and
improving access to credit—benefiting an estimated 2 million borrowers, mainly small
farmers; the sector had a loan value of about Birr 2 billion (2 percent of GDP) as of June
2006. The market share of the insurance sector (9 companies) is small, with only 3 percent of
the financial sector’s assets. The National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) regulates all three sectors.
There are no securities companies.

The banking system is dominated by the
state-owned Commercial Bank of
Ethiopia (CBE), but its market share has
been gradually declining while the other
commercial banks are expanding.

The banking system holds substantial

Loans
reserves beyond the required 5 percent of
Deposits
deposits, most of which are with the
55
state-owned CBE. This creates a hurdle
2001
2002
2003
2004
2005
2006
for active domestic and foreign exchange
interbank markets. The CBE dominates
the supply side of both markets, undermining their effectiveness. Financing government
deficits by issuing treasury bills to commercial banks helped reduce excess reserves from 29
percent at the end of 2005 to 14 percent a year later.
The payment system is very basic, with checks being the main noncash instrument, but
efforts are underway to make it a major component of the World Bank’s new capacitybuilding project.
There are continuing efforts to build capacity within the central bank to effectively supervise
banks and microfinance institutions, and to refine the laws and regulations to better ensure
that provisions for nonperforming loans (NPLs) are sufficient, and that creditor rights are
protected. Enforcement of creditor rights has been improved by the new law on foreclosure,
which allows creditor banks with loans secured by a mortgaged or pledged property to
foreclose by giving 30 days notice to the debtor. Banks are required to acquire collateralized

2007

26
property after two failed auctions. The NBE is being trained by AFRITAC to strengthen
capacity to assess bank risk management systems. Other areas of financial supervision are
being strengthened, especially for microfinance institutions and the insurance sector.
In 2003 Ethiopia adopted a Financial Restructuring Plan (FRP) for the CBE to reduce the
level of NPLs, which were 61.8 percent of outstanding loans. Based on the FRP, the
government adopted benchmarks for the banking sector to achieve one of Ethiopia’s
Millennium Development Goals, which calls for reducing NPLs to 15 percent by June 2007.
B. Soundness of the Banking System
Financial soundness indicators point to a well-capitalized, profitable, and liquid banking
sector (Annex, Table 1), with profitability improving for both public and private banks.
However, there is a notable performance gap between them: Private banks report higher
return on assets (ROA); public banks score higher on return on equity (ROE).8 Since Ethiopia
does not have a stock exchange, performance has no relevance to share prices, so interest in
ROE is limited to shareholders. The higher performance of the public banks on ROE may be
a reflection of low levels of capital.
The banking system has become more financially sound over the last two years as
supervision improved. The NPL ratio of the state-owned banks declined from 39 percent
in 2004 to 22 percent in 2006; in private commercial banks it declined from 12 percent to 6
percent. Capital adequacy ratios have stayed above the minimum requirement of 8 percent of
risk-weighted assets. Financial restructuring of state-owned banks is a primary reason for the
decline in NPLs. However, provisioning requirements recognize the value of collateral and
may significantly increase the balance sheet value of NPLs. Recent rapid credit growth is,
however, raising concerns about credit quality.
Management of bank liquidity is hampered by the absence of a secondary market for treasury
bills, and by the fact that both the interbank money market (where T-bills could be used as
collateral) and the foreign exchange market are very thin. The NBE and the CBE are the
main providers of liquidity support in situations involving Birr liquidity imbalances.
Liquidity in foreign currency is also mainly provided through sales by the NBE
supplemented by interbank activities between the CBE, as the supplier, and other banks.

8

The spread between bank lending and deposit rates is stable and relatively narrow. Weighted average lending
rates were 8.6 percent and the rates paid on customer deposits averaged 4.0 percent. However, there are
noteworthy differences between the spreads for public and private banks with respect to the lending rates, with
public banks about 2 percentage points narrower than private banks.

Assistance committed under the original framework is expressed in net present value (NPV) terms at the
completion point, and assistance committed under the enhanced framework is expressed in NPV terms at the
decision point. Hence, these two amounts cannot be added.

Under the enhanced framework, an additional disbursement is made at the completion point corresponding to
interest income earned on the amount committed at the decision point but not disbursed in the interim.

3

The MDRI provides 100 percent debt relief to eligible member countries. Grant assistance from the MDRI
Trust and HIPC resources provide debt relief to cover all debt owed to the Fund as of the end of 2004 that is
still outstanding when the member qualifies for debt relief.

IX.

Safeguards Assessment

According to Fund policy, an assessment of the National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) was
completed on September 12, 2001, with respect to the Poverty Reduction and Growth
Facility arrangement approved on March 22, 2001. The NBE has made progress in
implementing the recommendations of the safeguards assessment.
X.

Exchange Rate Arrangement

The de facto exchange rate regime was classified as a conventional peg (on April 1, 2006), in
light of the recent market developments. Though the authorities describe the de jure
exchange rate regime as a managed float with no predetermined path for the exchange rate,
the Birr has been relatively stable against the U.S. dollar. Furthermore, the NBE supplies
foreign exchange to the market based on plans established at the beginning of each fiscal
year that took into account estimates of likely supply and demand. The transaction-weighted
average interbank market exchange rate on May 9, 2007, was Br 8.8887 = US$1.
Ethiopia currently maintains four restrictions on the payments and transfers for current
international transactions, which relate to (a) the tax certification requirement for repatriation
of dividend and other investment income; (b) restrictions on repayment of legal external
loans and supplies and foreign partner credits; (c) rules for issuance of import permits by
commercial banks; and (d) the requirement to provide a clearance certificate from NBE to
obtain import permits. These restrictions are inconsistent with Article VIII, Section 2(a), of
the IMF’s Articles of Agreement and remain unapproved.
XI.

Article IV Consultation

Ethiopia is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle. The Executive Board concluded the
last Article IV consultation on March 17, 2006 (Country Report No. 06/122; EBM/06/26).

ANNEX II

Ethiopia: Relations with the World Bank
(As of April 2007)1
A.

Partnership in Ethiopia’s Development Strategy

1.
Bank and Fund share joint responsibility for supporting financial sector, taxation,
decentralization, and public expenditure reforms. The Bank leads the policy dialogue on
structural reforms relevant to economic growth and poverty reduction, including rural
development, infrastructure, private sector development (PSD), human development,
governance, protecting basic services delivery at the local level, and vulnerability.2 The
dialogue is supported by an extensive analytical agenda.
B.

Areas of Common Interest to Bank and Fund

2.
Preparation and Implementation of the PRSP. In January 2007, the government
presented the final draft of the second PRSP, an ambitious strategy called the Plan for
Accelerated and Sustained Development to End Poverty (PASDEP), covering 2005/06–
2009/10. The Ethiopian Parliament endorsed the strategy in 2006, implementation has begun,
and an Annual Progress Report on the first year of implementation is expected within a few
months. Bank and Fund collaborated in supporting formulation of the policy and the reform
agenda needed to underpin the Plan for Sustainable Development to End Poverty (PASDEP).
Together with the donor community, the Bank provided feedback on the draft PASDEP, and
work is beginning on a Joint Staff Advisory Note (JSAN) to be sent to the Boards of the
Bank and the Fund.
3.
Macroeconomic policy, private sector development, and the financial sector. Bank
and Fund cooperate closely in discussing macroeconomic policy with the government,
particularly in relation to the impact of the current macroeconomic situation and its
implications for eventual scaling up to achieve the MDGs. The Article IV consultation and
subsequent IMF reviews of macroeconomic performance are the most important input for
dialogue on macroeconomic issues within the context of the Protection of Basic Services
(PBS) operation. Bank and Fund have worked together on the DSA. With reference to
Ethiopia’s banking sector reforms, the two staffs are working in complementary areas in the
context of the Bank- approved Financial Sector Capacity Building grant (US$15 million) on
future reforms and on consolidating central bank supervisory and monetary policy functions.
The private sector development agenda is being elaborated, with recent efforts focusing on
restructuring the Private Sector Capacity Building operation, and completing in-depth value
chain analysis for a number of sectors, including leather manufacturing, oil and seeds, and
floriculture.

Table 1 on IDA portfolio composition (Section C below) provides details on engagement in these areas.

7
4.
Public sector reforms. Bank and Fund have been supporting the government’s
decentralization program with a view to improving the working of the civil service and local
service delivery, particularly incentives for regional and local performance in the formula for
subnational transfers of public resources. The Bank is also providing assistance for civil
service reform, tax and customs administration reform, legal reforms, and urban management
through the Public Sector Capacity Building Project (US$100 million) approved by the
World Bank Board in May 2004 and now operational.
5.
Public expenditure management. Traditionally the Fund has been an active
participant in Bank-coordinated annual public expenditure reviews (PERs). In 2005/06 the
government, the Bank, the Fund, and Joint Budget Support (JBS) donors introduced the first
annual Joint Budget and Aid Review (JBAR) as part of a new dialogue about the
government’s planning and budgeting cycle. This instrument, together with the fiduciary
assessment, replaced the PERs. Since May 2006, the scope of the JBAR has been refined and
two parts of the process identified.
6.
Part I, which has been subsumed into the due diligence requirements for the Protection
of Basic Services (PBS) project,3 has become the main method of information exchange and
dialogue between development partners and the government relating to PBS. The PBS has
generated a wealth of previously unavailable subnational fiscal data, which will be analyzed
and used to guide future Fund and Bank activities. It is expected that, together with the core
information-sharing activities, Part I will also investigate selected topics on a rotating basis.
The first JBAR review that took place in October 2006 led to very informative discussions on
financing and other aspects of the health sector, including discussions on decentralization. A
third JBAR is scheduled for May 2007, with a focus on agriculture and rural development.
7.
Part II of the JBAR process will have deeper analytical content, resulting in annual
reports. The reports will explore the rich analytical agenda underlying the relation between
public expenditure and poverty reduction, in conjunction with other economic and sector
works (ESWs). Issues to be examined in the near future are the costs of decentralization,
public efficiency and equity in infrastructural sectors, and the quality of intrasectoral
allocations.
8.
Fiduciary assessments. The Ministry of Finance and Economic Development
(MOFED) conducted a fiduciary assessment in 2004/05 jointly with JBS donors and the
Bank, the first of a series of annual fiduciary assessments (FAs). The FA for 2006/07 is now
underway. Like the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) initiative, FAs
are intended to consolidate various reviews of expenditure management systems in Ethiopia.
Aspects of the PER related to institutional and intergovernmental fiscal design issues, the
Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA), and the Country Procurement
Assessment Report (CPAR) will now appear in the FAs.
3

PBS currently accounts for about 28 percent of development assistance to Ethiopia and the quarterly findings
of the JBARs trigger donor disbursements.

8
9.
Millennium Development Goals. Bank and Fund have coordinated their work on
issues related to scaling up to meet the MDGs, particularly the assessment of the
government’s macroeconomic analysis and financing strategy. The Bank, together with UN
agencies in Ethiopia and the U.N. Millennium Project, has supported the government in
assessing sectoral needs to estimate the cost of the investments required to put Ethiopia on a
path to meet the MDGs. A synthesis report was issued in December 2005. The government
has grounded its macroeconomic scenarios for the PASDEP in the planning done for the
whole of the MDG period in the synthesis report. Adjustments were made after dialogue
during the budget process, particularly to adjust the investment plans to the expenditure
ceilings of the Medium-term Economic and Financing Framework (MEFF).
10. Debt sustainability analysis and the Enhanced HIPC Initiative. The Boards of the
Bank and the Fund agreed on April 20, 2004, that Ethiopia had reached the HIPC completion
point, making irrevocable the US$1.3 billion of NPV debt relief envisaged at the decision
point in November 2001. The Boards also approved an exceptional topping-up of debt relief
by an additional US$0.7 billion in NPV terms because of exogenous factors, particularly
changes in the discount rate and exchange rate since the decision point, that fundamentally
changed Ethiopia’s economic circumstances and adversely affected its debt sustainability.
MDRI debt relief with an NPV of approximately US$1.5 billion was approved by the IMF
board on December 21, 2005, and by the World Bank board on March 28, 2006. Bank and
Fund staffs updated the DSA before the completion point, for the MDRI, and for the present
2007 Article IV consultation staff report.
11. Statistical issues. Both institutions have been providing technical assistance to the
government on data and statistics. The Fund has focused on the macroeconomic side and the
Bank on improving the data on poverty and social indicators for monitoring of the outcomes
of Sustainable Development and Poverty Reduction Program (SDPRP)/PASDEP programs.
Further work related to increasing accountability and transparency and fostering structured
learning through evaluation—a priority identified in the PASDEP—is being planned.
12. Financial sector development. The Bank has provided funds for the National Bank of
Ethiopia (NBE) capacity building in banking and insurance regulation and supervision;
economic research; payments system modernization; improving credit referencing;
accounting and auditing; and developing the capital market infrastructure under a capacity
building project. The project has been designed to be carried out in close collaboration with
the Fund (Monetary and Capital Markets Department and AFRITAC East) to avoid TA gaps
and overlaps.
C.

Bank Group Strategy

13.
The Interim Country Assistance Strategy (ICAS) for Ethiopia, discussed in May 2006
and covering FY2006 (July 1–June 30), focuses on good governance and growth as at the
center of Bank support to Ethiopia. The ICAS aims to deepen support in (i) core
governance—public administration, decentralization, and public financial management;
(ii) fair and accountable provision of basic services; (iii) promotion of free enterprise;

9
(iv) improvement of agricultural productivity; and (v) development of infrastructure to
nurture the growth of small towns and growth corridors. A new CAS is expected to go to the
board in the second quarter of 2007/08.
14.
As of April 30, 2007, IDA’s portfolio of operations in Ethiopia comprised 20 active
projects with total net commitments of US$1,796 million and an undisbursed balance of
US$1,287 million (see table 1). In January 2006, there were 22 active projects, with total net
commitments of US$1,614 million and an undisbursed balance of US$939 million. Total
disbursements to Ethiopia amounted to US$301 million in 2005/06 (US$157 million in
grants), compared with US$373 million in 2005/06 (US$195 million in grants) and US$422
million in 2004/05 (US$179 million in grants).4

ANNEX III

Ethiopia: Relations with the African Development Bank
(As of April 2007)1
A.

Partnership in Ethiopia’s Development Strategy

1.
The assistance provided by the African Development Bank Group to Ethiopia since
2002 has been anchored in the country’s PRSP. Building on the achievements of the first
PRSP, Ethiopia has produced its second, the Plan for Sustainable Development to end
Poverty (PASDEP), which is a home-grown development strategy covering
2005/06–2009/10. The final draft of the PASDEP was presented to donors in January 2007.
The AfDB provided comments on the draft jointly with other Development Assistance Group
(DAG) donors. The AfDB will collaborate with the Fund, the World Bank, and other donors
in monitoring progress in PASDEP implementation through the Annual Progress Report.
B.

Areas of Common Interest to the AfDB, the World Bank, and the Fund

2.
Preparation and implementation of the PRSP. The AfDB will work closely with
both the Fund and the World Bank in supporting implementation of PASDEP and in policy
dialogue around structural reforms necessary for growth and poverty reduction, including
private sector development and public expenditure reform. The realization of Ethiopia’s
ambitious growth agenda in the PASDEP requires investment in infrastructure and
productivity-enhancing programs in the rural sector. The AfDB is supporting Ethiopia in
these areas in order to help create an enabling environment for sustained growth and poverty
reduction. Macroeconomic stability is of central importance for the effectiveness and longterm sustainability of current development efforts and to improve prospects for scaling up of
aid to attain the MDGs. Fund assessments of macroeconomic performance conducted
through Article IV consultation and surveillance missions are important inputs into the AfDB
country dialogue and programming process. Building on these assessments, the AfDB will
cooperate with the Fund, the World Bank, and other donors to ensure that external aid is
effective in promoting growth and reducing poverty in Ethiopia. The focus will be on policy
actions to promote fiscal sustainability and enhance the efficiency of propoor and progrowth
public expenditure in PASDEP priority areas, such as infrastructure.
3.
Macroeconomic policy, private sector development, and the financial sector: The
AfDB participated in the 2007 Article IV Consultation mission as part of its cooperation with
the Fund. In future, the AfDB and the Fund will seek to deepen their cooperation based on a
shared commitment to help Ethiopia achieve sustained growth and reduce poverty within a
stable macroeconomic framework. The AfDB is among the donors providing support for the
1

11
Protection of Basic Services (PBS) program using country systems and underpinned by
macro dialogue. Fund surveillance missions will provide a critical input into the PBS macro
dialogue, which forms part of the Joint Aid and Budget Review (JBAR). Both the AfDB and
the Fund recognize the importance of private sector development and a dynamic financial
sector for enhancing the competitiveness of the Ethiopian economy and promoting broadbased growth. The AfDB is supporting private sector development in Ethiopia by financing
infrastructure projects and capacity building for the privatization of public enterprises.2 It is
also providing support to rural micro-financial institutions (MFIs) to improve rural access to
financial services and build the capacity to regulate and supervise rural MFIs. The Fund’s
policy advice on financial sector reform will reinforce ongoing efforts to improve financial
intermediation, including the World Bank’s Financial Sector Capacity Building Project.
4.
Public expenditure management: Fiscal governance is an area of common interest
to the Fund, AfDB, and other donors because it lies at the core of aid effectiveness. The
AfDB, the World Bank, and other donors are engaged in dialogue with the Ethiopian
authorities on public expenditure management with the objective of ensuring that budgetary
allocations reflect PASDEP priorities for growth, poverty reduction, and human
development, and that increased propoor spending is translated into improved development
outcomes. The AfDB and other donors are undertaking joint efforts to support improvements
in Ethiopia’s fiduciary systems and enhance accountability in the management of public
resources through improved fiscal reporting. These efforts are underpinned by diagnostic
work, including the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA), which is a due
diligence requirement of the AfDB and other PBS donors. Efforts to strengthen fiscal
transparency and accountability in the context of PBS will complement the Fund’s technical
assistance in this important area.
5.
Millennium Development Goals: The AfDB, the World Bank, and the Fund share a
commitment to help Ethiopia achieve rapid progress toward the MDGs while maintaining
macroeconomic stability and keeping debt sustainable. The AfDB will collaborate with both
the Fund and the World Bank in helping Ethiopia to follow a sustainable path toward the
MDGs. This will involve further analytic work on the macroeconomic implications of scaledup assistance for the MDGs and the design of measures to help Ethiopia build its capacity to
absorb increased aid. The AfDB will also continue to support sector investment programs
targeted at the MDGs, such as rural water and sanitation.
6.
Enhanced HIPC Debt Relief and the MDRI: Ethiopia reached the completion point
under the enhanced HIPC Initiative in April 2004. In May 2004, its Board approved the
AfDB contribution to HIPC debt relief amounting to US$513.36 million in nominal and
US$339.46 million in NPV terms. Following the G8 decision in Gleneagles in July 2005 to
2

12
cancel the debt owed by HIPCs to multilateral institutions, the AfDB Board on April 19,
2006 approved cancellation of UA 587.70 million (equivalent to US$876 million) in debt
under the multilateral debt relief initiative (MDRI). The debt cancellation became effective
on September 30, 2006. The MDRI debt relief provided by the AfDB, the World Bank, and
the Fund has created fiscal space that Ethiopia will use to increase propoor and progrowth
spending. The AfDB and the World Bank are tracking use of the savings generated from debt
relief through the Joint and Aid Budget Reviews.
7.
AfDB Group Operations: The AfDB’s active portfolio comprises 23 operations
with a total commitment of UA 661.72 million (about US$980 million). This amount consists
of UA 496.60 million (US$740 million) in concessional loans and UA 165.12 million
(US$240 million) in grants. The active portfolio includes projects in agriculture,
infrastructure, and the social sector. The portfolio also include the Protection of Basic
Services Grant of UA 79.42 million (US$117 million) approved by the Board on December
20, 2006. In FY 2006, the Bank disbursed a total amount of UA 88.87 million (US$131
million). Disbursement flows in FY 2007 are projected to increase substantially as a result of
the PBS, which is a quick disbursing operation.
8.
AfDB Group Strategy: The AfDB’s Country Strategy Paper (CSP) for 2006–2009,
approved by the Board on September 6, 2006, is aligned to Ethiopia’s new PRSP, the
PASDEP. The CSP was prepared through a participatory process involving a broad range of
stakeholders. The DAG, which includes the Fund and the World Bank, was consulted when
the CSP was being prepared and before it was finalized. The overarching goal of the AfDB’s
medium-term assistance strategy is to promote growth and reduce poverty. The pillars of the
strategy are: agricultural transformation; infrastructure development; and governance. The
focus of AfDB support to agriculture is irrigation, which is vital to enhance Ethiopia’s
capacity to mitigate the impact of droughts. The priorities for infrastructure are rehabilitation
and upgrading of roads to better connect areas of high agriculture potential with markets;
rural electrification and development of hydro power; and water and sanitation. The
emphasis with respect to governance is on more accountability and transparency in the public
sector to ensure improved delivery of basic services.
9.
Statistics: Ethiopia is among the AfDB member countries receiving statistical
capacity-building support through the Africa Region International Comparison Program
(ICP), which the AfDB coordinates. In 2003, the ICP conducted a country statistical preassessment for Ethiopia. Based on this pre-assessment and the request from the government,
capacity-building support to the Central Statistics Authority (CSA) and the National
Accounts Department of Ministry of Finance and Economic Development (MoFED) was
approved. The support to both involves building capacity in price and expenditure statistics
for ICP through by providing computers, training, and technical assistance.

ANNEX IV

Ethiopia: Statistical Issues
General
1.
Data provided to the Fund are adequate for surveillance purposes, but there are
shortcomings in real, fiscal, and balance of payments statistics. Ethiopia participates in the
General Data Dissemination System (GDDS). Its metadata were first posted on the Fund’s
Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB) in November 2002 and were partially
updated in May/June 2006. Ethiopia has agreed to participate in the fiscal and monetary
modules of the successor GDDS project for Anglophone Africa.
2.
The authorities have agreed to assume responsibility for the Statistical Appendix for
Article IV Consultations commencing in 2008, as part of the pilot project launched by the
African Department of the IMF. The 2007 Statistical Appendix will be posted on the
National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) website (http://www.nbe.gov.et/) prior to the IMF Board
meeting to consider the 2007 Article IV Consultations.
Real sector
3.
A new series of GDP estimates (1995/96–2005/06) updated the base year
from 1980/81 to 1999/2000. However, there is scope for improving the quality of source data
because some internal consistency issues remain. First, the quality of GDP estimates by
industry is affected by the poor coverage of construction activities. Second, while some
progress has been made in making GDP estimates by final expenditure consistent with
output-based measures, there remain substantial shortcomings, particularly in the estimation
of private consumption and fixed capital formation. The statistical discrepancy in GDP
estimates by expenditure categories has been soaring in recent years. The authorities, with
technical assistance from the Africa Regional Technical Assistance Center (AFRITAC East),
are working to address these discrepancies by preparing supply and use tables. Follow-up
technical assistance from AFRITAC East on the CPI is planned.
Public finances
4.
Despite progress in 2003 in eliminating discrepancies between data on the domestic
and foreign financing of the budget deficit and the monetary accounts, significant
discrepancies in recent years continue to complicate assessment of fiscal developments.
Progress has been made in improving the quality and coverage of reporting on the
consolidated general government and consolidating federal and regional budgets—inclusive
of all extrabudgetary funds and accounts—within the decentralization of fiscal powers to
woredas (districts). Ensuring the integrity of consolidated budget reporting will be a
continuing task. Comprehensive information on the operations and financial position of
public enterprises is not available. Fiscal data for the central government for 2002 were
reported for the 2005 Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSY). The authorities
recently submitted 2003 data, albeit with several problems. No fiscal data is provided to the

14
Statistics Department (STA) of the IMF for publication in the International Finance
Statistics.
Monetary accounts
5.
Two STA technical assistance missions in 2004 found that the quality of monetary
and financial statistics was compromised by methodological problems. The missions
recommended correcting certain misclassifications of accounting data, helped the central
bank compile standardized report forms (SRFs) for reporting monetary statistics to STA, and
worked with the authorities and AFR to establish an integrated monetary database (IMD).
The follow-up mission in September 2004 finalized the IMD. The authorities then provided
SRF-based data for the NBE and other depository corporations to STA until December 2004.
At present, there is a need for the NBE to resume data submissions based on the SRF and
IMD framework.
Balance of payments
6.
Balance of payments data still require improvements on coverage, valuation, timing,
and classification of transactions. From 2004 to 2006, four balance of payments statistics
missions were completed as part of the GDDS project for Anglophone Africa. With
assistance from experts, the authorities drew up plans to publish data consistent with the fifth
edition of the Balance of Payments Manual. Questionnaire design and data collection
procedures have since improved, and new methods were introduced for c.i.f./f.o.b. valuation
adjustments for imports, external aid, trade credit, and bank financial account transactions.
The authorities have expressed interest in having a resident expert to help them to address
remaining shortcomings.
Social indicators
7.
Data on poverty are derived from household surveys regularly conducted by the
Central Statistical Authority.1 The World Bank has also produced reports on “Education and
Health Sector Development Programs” and the “Poverty and Policies for the New
Millennium Report” (1999), both of which contain data on the poverty situation. On the basis
of this information, the government, with assistance from the World Bank, has constructed
indicators for measuring poverty reduction, including income and expenditure per capita,
income inequality, literacy, malnutrition, and infant/child mortality. During 2004/05 the
authorities conducted a number of surveys to measure household welfare, including (i) a
participatory poverty assessment; (ii) the Household Income, Consumption and Expenditure
Survey (HICES); and (iii) a welfare monitoring survey. The data are currently being
1

Examples of regular surveys are the Household Income, Consumption, and Expenditure Survey (every five
years) and the Welfare Monitoring Survey (every three years). Other household and consumption surveys have
been carried out by the University of Addis Ababa in collaboration with Oxford University.

processed. There is no adequate data on prevalence rates of HIV/AIDS, especially among the
rural population, and it is not clear whether food consumption among people living in
drought-prone areas is properly monitored. The welfare monitoring survey conducted
in 2004/05 is expected to produce indicators relating to HIV/AIDS.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND AND
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA
Joint IMF/World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis 2007
Prepared by the staffs of the International Monetary Fund and
the International Development Association
Approved by Carlo Cottarelli and Siddharth Tiwari (IMF) and
Sudhir Shetty and Mark Thomas (IDA)
May 22, 2007
I. EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
In recent years Ethiopia has benefited from significant debt relief, which has helped to
ensure that its debt is sustainable. HIPC debt relief in 2004 and MDRI relief in 2006
lowered Ethiopia’s debt stock by about US$6 billion (about 40 percent of GDP), improving
its debt sustainability outlook substantially. Indeed, as of the beginning of 2006/07, the net
present value (NPV) of debt in relation to output stood at 6 percent and to exports at
36 percent, far below the thresholds suggested by the debt sustainability framework (DSF)
developed by the World Bank and the Fund.
The DSA shows Ethiopia at moderate risk of debt distress. While the debt burden
indicators are below the policy dependent-thresholds for the whole projection period in the
baseline, one stress test reaches the threshold in terms of debt to exports (Figure 1). In the
baseline scenario, the NPV of debt to exports is projected to reach about 60 percent in five
years and then hold there over the long run; this is well below the prudent threshold
(150 percent of exports) set in connection with the DSF for a country classified as a “medium
performer” based on the World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment rating
(2003-2005). The NPV of debt to GDP is projected to level out at about 15 percent by
2025/26, also well below the prudent threshold of 40 percent of GDP. Debt service is
manageable throughout the period, rising only to 3 percent of exports in 2025/26.
Over the medium term the debt profile based on historical parameters is less favorable
in terms of output but comparable to the baseline scenario in terms of exports. The ratio
of debt to GDP based on historical patterns is considerably less favorable than the baseline
forecast. This is because the average annual growth rate in U.S. dollars for 1995–2005 period
was only 5 percent but it is projected to average almost 8 percent over the next two decades.
Debt stabilizes at about 70 percent of exports in the historical scenario, slightly higher than in
the baseline scenario. This is attributable to the fact that higher debt financing is needed to
cover the average current account deficit for the 1995–2005 period of 3.3 percent of GDP
(used as the basis for the historical scenario) than for the projected current account deficit of
2 percent for the 2009–25 period.

2
Box 1. Macroeconomic Assumptions for the Baseline Scenario
Real GDP grows annually at about 8 percent until 2010/11, falling to 7 percent thereafter.
Exports of goods and services are projected to grow in volume at an annual rate of about
9 ½ percent between 2007/08 and 2010/11 but export prices are projected to remain flat.
Thereafter, exports grow at 11 ½ percent because prices are assumed to improve.
The current account deficit (before official transfers) is projected to decline from
17 percent of GDP to 12 ½ percent through 2010/11 and to improve further to average out at
7 percent of GDP over the long term. However, official international reserves coverage is
projected to be at the lower end of the target of 10–12 weeks of imports over the next five
years because of high import growth but then rise to 5 months of imports by 2025/26.
Foreign direct investment is envisaged to average about 2 ½ percent of GDP through
2010/11 and rise to 2 ¾ percent of GDP thereafter.
Loan financing on concessional terms is projected to average about 4 percent of GDP
annually through 2010/11 but then decline to below 1 percent of GDP by 2025/26.
Sensitivity analysis
For Ethiopia, the two most extreme stress tests involve (i) applying one half standard
deviation shock to growth, exports and grants and (ii) new borrowing at less favorable
rates. Since Ethiopia has been accustomed to severe droughts over the past two decades, the
standard deviation of output and export growth is high. Applying one half standard deviation
shocks to growth, exports, and grants in 2006/07 and 2007/08 has a very important bearing
on the debt profile since the ratio of debt to exports peaks at about 155 percent in 2010/11
and eventually levels out at 95 percent in 2025/26.
While borrowing at less favorable rates raises the level of debt in relation to exports by
about 50 percent, it does not lead to a breach in the debt threshold. Over half of the new
lending over the medium term is disbursed by the World Bank at an interest rate of
0.75 percent with a 10-year grace period and a 50-year repayment period. The stress test
involving more expensive financing assumes that the average interest rate is higher by
2 percentage points for the whole forecast period. Since Ethiopia is expected to continue to
borrow large amounts over the medium-term, this interest rate hike has significant adverse
effects on the debt profile. However, the effects are much more gradual than for the scenario
with shocks with the debt to export ratio peaking at 107 percent in 2018/19. Higher financing
costs raise the debt-to-GDP ratio to peak at about 25 percent, and the debt service-to-export
ratio levels out at 5 ½ percent. All these estimates are below the prudent thresholds.
The debt profile is sensitive to assumptions made about export growth in the long run.
The baseline long-run forecast assumes that export growth levels out at about 11 ½ percent a

3
year. This estimate is comparable to the historical average for 1995–2005. However, it also
implies a rising export share of output over time, since output in U.S. dollars is projected to
grow at 8 percent a year. If the export ratio is projected to stabilize over the forecast period,
this would have adverse effects on the debt to export ratio. Figure 2 presents the baseline
projection and the profile of debt and debt service in relation to exports, assuming that
exports in US dollars grow at the rate of output. In this case debt rises to about 100 percent of
exports by 2025/26 in the sensitivity scenario, while debt service in relation to exports
stabilizes at about 5 ½ percent a year. Though these figures are considerably higher than in
the baseline scenario, they are still below the prudent thresholds.
The inclusion of commercial loans to public enterprises has a sizeable effect on the DSA
over the medium-term and is another justification for categorizing the debt risk as
moderate. The baseline scenario excludes commercial loans to public enterprises because
they are not publicly guaranteed. This is one reason why Ethiopian Airline debt was not
included in the ceiling of noncommercial debt in recent Fund-supported programs with
Ethiopia. Ethiopian Airlines is currently financing 10 new Boeing 787 airplanes through
2012 at a cost of US$1.2 billion and the Ethiopian electricity company also has ambitious
investment plans. The Ethiopian telecom company is also investing up to US$1.5 billion over
the next 10 years. Incorporating these loans into the baseline (Figure 2), the NPV of debt to
exports peaks at 140 percent in 2011/12 but then settles down to 60 percent over the long
term. The debt service to exports ratio rises rapidly to peak at 14 percent within five years but
then gradually falls toward the baseline estimate as the loans of the public enterprises are
paid off. The stress tests also show considerably higher debt burden ratios when public
enterprise debt is included, with breaches of all three indicative thresholds.
I. FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
The fiscal DSA is based on the assumption that annual domestic financing over the
medium term will be around 2–2 ½ percent of GDP. As a result, the ratio of total debt to
GDP is projected to decline gradually from about 40 percent of GDP in 2005/06 to below
30 percent in the long run (Figure 3). This profile is slightly stronger than the corresponding
scenario based on historical averages for the main macroeconomic determinants of public
debt dynamics. One reason for the rapid decline in total debt over the medium term is that
domestic interest rates rise only gradually to level out at 7 percent. If we assume a
3 percentage point increase in interest rates over the complete projection period, the ratio of
total debt to GDP falls only modestly and stays at around 35 percent in the long run.
II. CONCLUSION
While external debt ratios have improved considerably with debt relief, the DSA shows
a moderate risk of debt distress based on stress tests. These stress tests capture the
vulnerability of the Ethiopian economy to shocks and illustrate the importance of securing
grant and concessional financing and containing domestic borrowing if debt is to stay

4
sustainable over the medium to long term. Also important are strengthened debt management
capacity and a comprehensive public debt strategy that specifically includes public enterprise
debt and contingent liabilities. Finally, the impact on debt ratios of new borrowing in
infrastructure sectors underlines the need to ensure that these investments lead to sufficiently
high returns.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and r = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes
contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that NPV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments devided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the
baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the
shock (implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with
The Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia
On June 1, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with The Federal Democratic Republic of
Ethiopia.19
Background
Ethiopia’s favorable economic performance in recent years has significantly contributed
to poverty reduction and progress toward the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
The economy has enjoyed a strong and steady growth in the past three years after a
significant drought-related contraction in 2002/03. This strong growth performance
resulted in real per capita income increasing at 7 percent per annum—the fastest in
Ethiopia’s recent history. However, this has been accompanied by rising inflation, with
consumer price accelerating to 19 percent in February 2007.
Net domestic borrowing for budget financing rose to 3.1 percent of GDP in 2005/06 from
0.2 percent of GDP in 2003/04, reflecting declining domestic revenue effort and
significantly reduced budget support from donors (a shortfall of 2 percentage points of
GDP from what was budgeted) in view of political governance concerns following the
2005 election. Thus, despite efforts to reduce government expenditures by cutting largescale infrastructure projects and constraining recurrent outlays, the overall budget deficit
(including grants) remained large at about 4½ percent of GDP in 2004/05–2005/06.

19

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions
with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and
financial information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and
policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for
discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing
Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this
summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the
Executive Board as expressed during the June 1, 2007 Executive Board discussion based
on the staff report.

2
Broad money growth remained fast in 2005/06, driven by credit expansion to both the
government and nongovernment sectors. The demand for bank credit rose sharply to
finance large-scale investment projects by the public enterprises and the rapidly
expanding private sector. Substantial negative real interest rates and commercial banks’
excess reserves facilitated the rapid expansion of credit.
Furthermore, current account deficit (after official grants) widened to 10½ percent of
GDP in 2005/06, reflecting rising domestic demand. Although exports grew steadily,
imports—particularly for raw material and capital goods—rose even faster, while donor
assistance was reduced significantly. As a result, the overall balance of payments
moved from a significant surplus in 2003/04 to a cumulative deficit equivalent to 2
percent of GDP during 2004/05–2005/06. Gross official international reserves declined
from the equivalent of 3.7 months of imports at end-2003/04 to 2.1 months of imports at
end-2005/06. The official exchange rate for the birr, however, remained relatively stable
against the U.S. dollar (the intervention currency) at around birr 8.7 per U.S. dollar in
2005/06.
Strong economic growth is expected to continue in 2006/07. Real GDP growth is
projected to hold at about 9½ percent as productivity gains in agriculture continue and
nonagriculture activities, especially manufacturing and construction, expand further.
Inflation is projected to decline to about 15 percent at the end of 2006/07, in light of the
completion of the pass-through of fuel price increases and full adoption by farmers of
the new pattern for food supply. After a period of relative stability, the depreciation of the
birr against the U.S. dollar is expected to continue, reflecting the recent external balance
developments.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed Ethiopia’s recent strong and steady growth, which has
also led to the fastest increase in real per capita incomes in recent years, and
encouraging progress toward achieving the MDGs. At the same time, pressures on
domestic prices and the balance of payments are emerging, the fiscal deficit remains
large, and the economy continues to be vulnerable to weather-related shocks and
shortfalls in donor support. Directors considered that, to further strengthen Ethiopia’s
growth prospects and to meet its poverty alleviation goals, structural reforms will need to
be intensified in the period ahead. These should aim to eliminate infrastructural and
administrative bottlenecks, and support the further development of the agricultural
sector and the emergence of a robust and flexible private sector.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ plans to adhere to a policy of fiscal restraint, as
shown by the tightened 2006/07 budget and the intention to limit domestic borrowing.
They supported the recent steps to enhance fiscal revenues, and encouraged the
authorities to take further measures to restrain domestic demand, if required. Such
measures could include stretching out expenditures on projects with a large import
content and cutting low-priority outlays, while safeguarding poverty-reducing and
growth-enhancing spending. Directors encouraged the authorities to strengthen debt
management capacity and develop a comprehensive public debt strategy over the

3
medium term. In this regard, Directors suggested that the authorities avail themselves of
Fund technical assistance.
Directors called for a tightening of monetary policy to reduce inflation and prevent the
entrenchment of inflationary expectations. To help mop up excess reserves in the
banking system, and pending the introduction of more sophisticated indirect monetary
instruments, the authorities could consider testing the efficacy of issuing longer-term
bonds. A gradual move to positive real interest rates would also help to contain
inflationary pressures.
Directors welcomed the recent increase in exchange rate flexibility, and recommended
that it be continued. This should allow the exchange rate to better reflect balance of
payments developments and lay the groundwork for the needed buildup in international
reserves. Directors cautioned that continued appreciation of the real exchange rate
could weaken external competitiveness over the medium term, and encouraged the
authorities to adopt productivity-enhancing structural reforms.
Directors observed that a critical challenge for Ethiopia is to accelerate structural
reforms to buttress and sustain growth while maintaining macroeconomic stability.
Emerging supply constraints need to be addressed expeditiously, and absorptive
capacity expanded. Further efforts are needed to improve the investment climate,
strengthen the financial sector, and promote trade openness. Directors encouraged the
authorities to consider undertaking financial sector reforms within the framework of a
developmental Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP).
Directors considered that data provided to the Fund are adequate for surveillance
purposes, but that data shortcomings continue to complicate the analysis of economic
developments, in particular with regard to the real sector and fiscal and balance of
payments statistics. They called for further remedial efforts, and they supported the
authorities’ request for technical assistance from the Fund in this area.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Peter Gakunu, Executive Director
for The Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia
and Joseph Tekman Kanu, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
June 1, 2007
1.
The Ethiopian authorities acknowledge that the staff report provides a realistic view
of the policy challenges facing them going forward. They consider the report to be broadly
balanced and agree on the need to address the existing imbalances, especially those relevant
to growth. In designing their policy response to address these imbalances, the authorities aim
at reaching a policy mix that is adequate to preserve macroeconomic stability and sustain
strong growth. They are of the view that the Article IV consultations provided an excellent
opportunity to take stock of the progress made in recent years, especially under the PASDEP.
They also agree that continued exchange of views on key policy issues is useful in supporting
their ongoing efforts to boost Ethiopia’s long-term growth prospects Going forward, the
major challenges facing the authorities include (i) addressing fiscal slippages (ii) tackling
inflation and exchange rate, (iii) undertaking reforms to address structural bottlenecks
affecting private sector-led growth, and (iv) external shocks including bad weather
conditions.
Recent Economic Developments
2.
Ethiopia’s economy continues to enjoy a buoyant expansion after the drought related
events of 2002/03. Real GDP grew by an annual average of 10.7 percent for the period
2003/04 through 2005/06, well above the 5.8 percent average for sub-Saharan Africa. Also,
real per capita income increased during the period at an annual average of 7 percent. Growth
remains broad based with manufacturing, construction, and services, all providing significant
contributions. However, inflation has accelerated, reaching 19 percent in February 2007. The
surge in food prices in particular, reflected an increase in disposable income and the reduced
supply of cereals resulting from the shift from food to cash aid. However, the high food
prices in the urban areas mainly impacted on the poor.
3.
There were shortfalls in domestic revenue, including significant reductions in donor
budgetary support, which resulted in an increase in net domestic borrowing to 3.1 percent of
GDP in 2005/06. Consequently, a scaling down of expenditures from the original budget was
undertaken by the authorities whereby large-scale infrastructure projects were postponed and
restraints imposed on recurrent outlays. Despite these developments, the budget deficit
remains large at about 4.5 percent of GDP a year for 2004/05–2005/06.
4.
Broad money grew in 2005 and 2006 due to increased credit expansion to both
government and the private sector. The increased demand for imports resulted in a widening
of the external current account deficit to 10.5 percent of GDP in 2005/06. Although the
capital account surplus doubled, the overall balance of payments experienced a rapid
transition from the surplus in 2003/04 to a cumulative deficit equivalent to 2 percent of GDP
for the periods 2004/05 and 2005/06. Subsequently, gross official international reserves
declined from 3.7 months of imports at the end of 2003/04 to an equivalent of 2.1 months of

2
imports at the end of 2005/06. The local currency, the birr remained relatively stable despite
the widening external imbalances and the real effective exchange rate appreciated by
6 percent in 2006.
Actions to Address Existing Macroeconomic Imbalances
(i)

Fiscal Policy

5.
The Ethiopian authorities are determined to address the various macroeconomic
imbalances impacting on the economy. In this regard, efforts are being made to ensure fiscal
policy assists in containing pressures on prices and that international reserves are maintained
at comfortable levels. The authorities will maintain the agreed level of domestic borrowing at
between 2–2.5 percent in order to ensure achievement of the following objectives: (i) release
resources to the private sector over the medium term, while ensuring a gradual decline in
overall money growth to help contain inflationary pressures, (ii) contain demand pressures
and mitigate impacts on the external position, and (iii) gradually reduce domestic debt and
provide the needed flexibility to respond to shocks, particularly climatic shocks that may call
for additional expenditures. While streamlining nonessential recurrent outlays, there will be
adequate provision for operations and maintenance. Expenditures on capital goods will be
reduced in the event of revenue shortfalls, while additional efforts will be undertaken to
mobilize more domestic revenue.
(ii)

Monetary Policy

6.
Monetary policy will continue to support fiscal policy through introduction of more
effective monetary instruments. In the absence of effective indirect instruments, the
authorities have relied on direct instruments, which have not been relatively effective in
curbing credit growth, given the excess reserves in the banking system. To ensure
effectiveness in policy implementation, the authorities intend to concentrate more on indirect
instruments especially over the medium term. In view of this, efforts are ongoing to develop
an institutional framework for active open market operations; implementation of reforms in
the financial sector to facilitate intermediation, strengthen risk-based management and
supervision, and improve the environment for competition; and ensuring successful mopping
up of excess cash reserves in the banking system through the sale of longer-term securities,
facilitate the interbank market, and promote a more efficient and competitive financial sector.
7.
Given concerns for inflation, particularly its impact on the urban poor and the low
level of international reserves due to delayed disbursements of external assistance, the
authorities intend to consolidate macroeconomic stability while maintaining growth
momentum over the medium term. With the emerging positive indications that the external
position will be strengthened in 2006/07, efforts will be directed at reducing the current
account deficit by about half, to 5.6 percent of GDP. This will be supported by increased
export growth, led by coffee and horticulture, combined with substantial increases in official
transfers as relations with donors continue to normalize. As a result, the targeted overall
balance of payments surplus of 2.1 percent of GDP will be achieved and will raise the level

3
of gross official international reserves to the equivalent of 2.2 months of imports by the end
of 2006/07.
(iii)

Exchange Rate Policy

8.
To strengthen monetary policy, the authorities’ exchange rate policy will also
continue to focus on achieving the inflation and international reserves targets. Inflation,
which is currently at double digits, will be reduced to single digits. The authorities are
however requesting further TA to help identify and address the factors contributing to the
high inflation. They will continue to pursue prudent fiscal and monetary policies and a more
flexible exchange rate. In addition, efforts will be directed at ensuring a gradual move to
obtaining positive real interest rates. As a result, a cautious approach would be pursued in
this direction in line with ongoing structural changes. This will help to significantly tighten
monetary policy to keep high-inflation expectation from becoming entrenched. Going
forward, the authorities are studying the possibilities of undertaking financial sector reforms
within the framework of a developmental FSAP.
9.
On the external front, the authorities have expressed their commitment to strengthen
the reserves position by implementing measures such as issuance of directives to promote
inward remittances and foreign currency deposits. Given that the current nominal exchange
rate may not enhance growth over the medium term, the authorities are considering a reversal
of the real appreciation achieved in recent years in an orderly and gradual manner. They will
allow the exchange rate to depreciate more rapidly within the context of the de jure regime of
a managed float.
The PASDEP Strategy
10.
To achieve the objectives of the MDGs, the authorities have continued with
implementation of the PASDEP strategy which largely focuses on boosting economic
activity through commercializing agriculture and fostering the nonfarm private sector.
PASDEP policies will further concentrate on removing obstacles to growth, stimulating
private sector development, and building the financial sector.
11.
The authorities consider macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability as the major
conduits for achieving strong and sustainable growth, given efforts to address the emerging
supply constraints while expanding implementation and absorptive capacities. Major reforms
will be undertaken to address constraints arising from access to land, the existing limited
access to financing, in part caused by the limited capacity of domestic banks and the paucity
of financial instruments; and the high transportation costs driven by the landlocked nature of
the country. In addition, efforts will also be made to focus on improving the investment
climate, strengthening the financial sector, and promoting trade openness.
12.
Going forward, the authorities have identified major obstacles to private sector
growth, in particular, the cumbersome licensing requirements, rigid labor market regulations,
costly property registration, lengthy export and import procedures, and the high cost of
enforcing contracts. To tackle these obstacles, they have introduced a one-stop-shop to

4
facilitate operations by new investors; established the Investors Advisory Council to allow
regular consultations with the private sector; adopted an investment code that grants
incentives; and have passed a business-friendly tax reform program.
13.
The Ethiopian authorities will work towards mobilizing savings and allocating
resources efficiently, given that a sound, dynamic, and competitive financial sector is
essential to promote growth and reduce poverty. They will ensure that more action is taken to
improve the quality of bank portfolios to enhance banking supervision and advocate
risk-based management of credit. The authorities will also encourage increased competition
in the banking sector to improve the efficiency of monetary policy.
Conclusion
14.
Prospects for the medium-term economic outlook for Ethiopia remain highly
favorable, with real GDP growth expected to average 7.5 percent a year for the period
2007/08– 2010/11. To achieve this, the authorities intend to reinforce the foundations for
growth, achievement of the MDGs and meeting PASDEP targets, underpinned by their
strategy of consolidating macroeconomic stability.
15.
The authorities are aware of the challenges ahead and are ready to strike a judicious
balance between demand-dampening measures and growth-enhancing structural economic
reforms. Additional efforts will be made to intensify policy implementation over the medium
term in order to contain any pressures on prices and the balance of payments. This will place
inflation on check and maintain the intended level of international reserves.
16.
To ensure debt sustainability over the medium term, the authorities will continue to
secure grant and concessional financing and limit domestic borrowing. They are already
preparing a comprehensive public debt management strategy that will also include public
enterprises debt and contingent liabilities, and will strengthen their current debt management
capacity.
17.
Given the importance of data in ensuring effective analysis of economic
developments, the authorities are committed to improving the quality of data, and are
therefore, requesting technical assistance from donors and the Fund. They also intend to
address the high turnover of relevant staff, define priorities, and improve inter-agency
coordination in order to ensure sustainability of statistical reforms.
18.
The Ethiopian authorities continue to express their commitment to remain engaged
with the Fund. They are of the view that one critical issue to achieving the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs) is the need for scaling up of financing. The authorities therefore
call on the Fund to provide the needed signals for full donor participation in their
macroeconomic stabilization and growth drive. Once this is achieved, sustaining the current
growth trajectory is of crucial importance for which considerable Fund support is required.
