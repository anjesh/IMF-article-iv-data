STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
May 14, 2014

KEY ISSUES
Context: Over the last two decades, good governance and sound macroeconomic
management have delivered remarkable economic and social progress to Cabo Verde.
More recently, however, growth has slowed due to the prolonged downturn in Europe
and a sharp deterioration in domestic confidence. A longer-term decline in the
contribution of total factor productivity to growth may also have played a role. Financial
stability risks have increased with the rise in non-performing loans and fall in bank
profitability. The country remains vulnerable to external shocks, given its dependence on
tourism, remittances, and concessional financing. Over the longer term, Cabo Verde’s
challenge as a new middle-income country is to bolster productivity and diversify the
sources of growth.
Fiscal consolidation remains critical to safeguard macroeconomic and debt
sustainability. Budgetary plans for 2014 and the medium term entail rising public debt,
and are subject to downside risks to revenue. The authorities have already decided on a
package of expenditure containment measures for 2014–17. However, given the high
albeit sustainable level of public debt, further measures are needed to put public debt
on a more robust downward path. Bolstering domestic revenue mobilization, increasing
the efficiency of public investment, and managing existing infrastructure better are also
central to sound public finances.
International reserves have recovered, which provided room to ease monetary
policy in support of the recovery. In the absence of imminent pressures on the
balance of payments or on prices, and with private sector credit growth having stalled,
the central bank has cut the policy rate. At the same time, given pressures on the
banking system, continued vigilance regarding risks to financial stability is warranted.
Structural reforms hold the key to bolstering competitiveness, creating jobs, and
delivering inclusive growth. Increasing labor market efficiency and reducing skill
mismatches would be particularly beneficial in this regard. Enhancing the efficiency of
state-owned enterprises is also essential to improve delivery of infrastructure services.
Data are adequate for surveillance purposes, though some key shortcomings
remain. In particular, national accounts data are released with a long delay.
This complicates the formulation of macroeconomic policies.

DEVELOPMENTS AND CHALLENGES AHEAD
A. The Long-Term Setting
1.
Over the last two decades, Cabo Verde has made impressive strides in economic and
social development. Rapid economic growth, driven in large part by an expansion in tourism and
public investment, helped the country graduate to middle-income country status in 2007. It has also
dramatically reduced poverty—from 49 percent in 1989 to 25 percent in 2011—and raised living
standards, such that achievement of all Millennium Development Goals by 2015 is within reach.
2.
Now, to sustain its progress over the medium term, Cabo Verde must identify new
drivers of growth. The large-scale Public Investment Program (PIP) is beginning to wind down, and
tourism may grow less rapidly as limits to market share are reached. In addition, with total factor
productivity in Cabo Verde having fallen over the last decade, structural reforms that boost
competitiveness are critical to support job-creating and inclusive growth (Appendix).1
3.
At the same time, fiscal consolidation remains essential to ensure debt sustainability.
During the last few years, the combination of weaker revenue performance and higher capital
expenditure has driven up public debt to 98 percent of GDP at end-2013—a rise of 40 percentage
points since 2008. Even though debt financing has been highly concessional, there are risks to debt
sustainability if progress on fiscal consolidation stalls.2

B. Current Conditions
4.
During 2013, the economy continued to face significant headwinds from the anemic
recovery in Europe and weak domestic confidence (Table 1 and Figure 1).


Real GDP growth is estimated at 0.5 percent for 2013, a further slowdown from the
1.2 percent growth registered in 2012 and 4 percent in 2011. While tourism—which accounts for
about a fifth of the economy—continued to do well, private consumption and investment
remained very weak, and credit to the economy grew by only 1 percent. Unemployment was
16½ percent at end-2013 (about the same as in 2012, and up from 12 percent in 2011), with
youth unemployment double that rate. Average inflation fell to 1½ percent, reflecting weak
economic conditions and contained global price developments.



The balance of payments was once again in small surplus (Table 2). The current account deficit
narrowed considerably, to about 4½ percent of GDP, reflecting in particular a sharp decline in
capital goods imports as investment declined. In the capital account, private flows continued to

1

Cabo Verde was part of a recent IMF study of total factor productivity in small Middle Income Countries in SubSaharan Africa (Country Report No. 14/41). Results from this analytical work were presented during the mission.
2

Concessional financing is typically available to a country for an additional five years after graduating to MiddleIncome Country (MIC) status. However, due to the global downturn and to Cabo Verde’s status as a small island
country, donors decided to extend access to concessional financing for a few additional years.

decline, reflecting a further contraction in FDI and in particular a reversal of capital flows to
commercial banks and of other private debt-related flows. International reserves recovered to about
4½ months of prospective imports.
5.
As a result of the authorities’ budget reprogramming exercise, fiscal performance in
2013 was less expansionary than originally budgeted (Text Table 1, page 12; and Table 3b).
This was in line with the Fund’s policy advice.


Total revenue increased by about ¾ percentage point of GDP, considerably less than originally
budgeted. While tax revenue edged down about ¼ percentage point, grants increased by
½ percentage point. Other non-tax revenue increased by the same amount, bolstered by
additional resources from other state agencies that have been brought into the central budget
through the creation of the Single Treasury Account.



Current expenditure and public investment were reduced significantly during the mid-year
budget reprogramming exercise, in light of revenue shortfalls and delays in some external
financing.3 Current expenditure is estimated as 1½ percentage points of GDP lower than
budgeted, while public investment (including onlending) was 4 percentage points of GDP lower.
The authorities were able to safeguard social spending from these containment measures.



The fiscal deficit fell by about 2 percentage points of GDP, to 7¾ percent. Including onlending,
total financing was 13.2 percent of GDP—about ½ percentage point less than in 2012.

6.
Monetary conditions eased over the course of the year, as reflected in the build-up
of excess liquidity in banks (Table 4a and Figure 2). Since May 2013, when the BCV adopted
a market-based process for placing central bank bills, rates on these instruments (and also on shortterm government securities) have fallen below 1 percent—significantly below the 5.75 percent policy
rate. Other interest rates have been relatively sticky at higher levels. For deposits, higher rates partly
reflect ongoing competition between banks to secure emigrant funds. And for loans, higher rates
are related to continued risk aversion by banks, against the backdrop of high NPLs. Looking at
liquidity conditions, while banks overall are in a situation of excess, this has not yet translated into
credit growth. In the absence of a functioning interbank market and given the relatively high cost of
BCV overdraft facilities, banks do not want to risk getting caught short. In addition, given the sharp
rise in NPLs, banks have become more risk averse in the extension of new credit.
7.
Financial stability has been weakened by the slowdown in growth (Table 5). The NPL
ratio peaked at 20 percent in September 2013, though fell back to 16 percent by year-end.4
3

In recent years, the procedure for approving the operating budget has included “freezing” 30 percent of
expenditure on goods and services (except for medication, food, security, and a few other items), which can only be
spent if revenue performs as budgeted. The “freezing” also affects nonfinancial assets, namely the purchase of
administrative equipment and cargo transport equipment (except purchases of sovereign entities). For the
investment budget, a minimum of 30 percent (and in some cases up to 50 percent) of expenditure is similarly frozen.
4
The BCV noted that based on their NPL definitions (Circular 150, rather than IAS/IFRS), Cabo Verde’s financial
stability indicators are stronger. Their NPL ratio (which includes only installments that are 90 days or more past due,
except where the cumulative past due installments exceed 25 percent of the loan balance) was only 13 percent in
December 2013, and the ratio of provisions to NPLs was 60 percent (rather than 48 percent).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

5

CABO VERDE

Capital adequacy appears to remain solid for the banking system as a whole, with the ratio of capital
to risk-weighted assets (CAR) reaching 13 percent at end-2013, comfortably above the 10 percent
regulatory minimum. However, in one bank the CAR has fallen just below the regulatory minimum.
In addition, given that provisioning has not kept up with the rise in NPLs (the coverage ratio is 48
percent, down from 52 percent a year ago), there is a risk that actual capital (if impaired loans are
properly provisioned) could be lower.
8.
Policy implementation in 2013 was broadly in line with the Fund’s policy advice.
As recommended in the last Article IV, capital and current spending was curtailed compared to the
original budget. However, the Fund’s recommendation to adopt an ambitious medium-term fiscal
consolidation plan was not adopted. The Fund had also recommended a neutral monetary policy
stance to support a rebuilding of reserves. The BCV kept rates on hold through 2013. There has also
been further progress in strengthening supervision, as called for by the Fund in order to enhance
Cabo Verde’s financial stability framework.
9.
On the political front, the next parliamentary and presidential elections are expected
in 2016. Prime Minister Jose Maria Neves, who began his third consecutive term in February 2011,
represents the PAICV (Partido Africano da Independência de Cabo Verde). President Jorge Carlos
Fonseca, in power since August 2011, is from the main opposition party, the MpD (Movimento para
a Democracia). These two parties have been central in Cabo Verdean politics since independence in
1975, with each party having ruled for about a decade and now alternating power regularly.

C. External Assessment
10.
While the external position has improved somewhat, Cabo Verde remains vulnerable
due to its increasing external debt and challenges to competitiveness (Box 1). International
reserves have recovered to about 4½ months of prospective imports, and are projected to remain
around this level over the medium term. This reflects a healthy outlook for goods and services
exports, and significant official financing flows (already committed). The exchange rate is assessed as
broadly in line with fundamentals, as found in the last assessment (undertaken in March 2013).
However, Cabo Verde’s high dependence on tourism and remittances points to significant external
vulnerabilities. In addition, business sector surveys indicate that competitiveness remains a
challenge. Cabo Verde is ranked 122nd out of 148 countries on global competitiveness by the World
Economic Forum, with labor market efficiency, financial market development, and macroeconomic
environment found to be particular challenges.

Box 1. External Stability Assessment1
An external stability analysis suggests that the real effective exchange rate (REER) is broadly in line with
medium-term fundamentals. However, competitiveness remains weak, on account of inefficiencies in the labor
market and access to financing. Improving the business environment and increasing the productivity of human
and physical capital remain critical for bolstering medium-term growth.
Over the last decade, Cabo Verde’s balance of payments has been characterized by a relatively stable
current account deficit (of about 16 percent of GDP), mostly used to finance investment. As grants and FDI
have declined, the deficit has been financed

Economic Forum (WEF), Cabo Verde ranks 122nd out of 148 countries on global competitiveness, with market
size, labor market efficiency, macroeconomic environment, and financial market development found to be
particularly weak (see Table). In WEF business surveys, access to financing, labor market issues (cited under
several factors), and inadequate supply of infrastructure feature among the most problematic factors for
doing business (see Chart). Structural reforms aimed at improving the business climate therefore remain
critical for bolstering competitiveness and attracting private investment.

D. Outlook and Risks
11.
Staff forecasts a modest economic recovery in 2014, with GDP growth of 3 percent.
The improving outlook for the euro area bodes well for remittances, FDI, and tourism (although
competition from destinations in North Africa could increase in 2014). Better external conditions and
continued strength in tourism are expected to help consumer and business sentiment recover.
There are also encouraging signs that a number of stalled FDI projects in tourism will resume in
2014. As monetary conditions have eased and NPLs are gradually being resolved, banks should also
be in a stronger position to increase credit to the private sector. Over the medium term, and
drawing on the experience of other small middle-income countries, staff sees growth of about
4 percent as consistent with a lower middle-income economy that still faces challenges on the
competitiveness front (Appendix Table 1). The balance of payments is forecast to again reach a small
surplus in 2014. While imports are expected to rebound, reflecting a recovery in consumer
sentiment and investment, strong remittances and public capital flows (as well as an uptick in FDI)
should allow international reserves to cover about 4½ months of prospective imports.
12.

The outlook remains subject to both upside and downside risks (Table 7).



On the upside, a more rapid resumption of FDI in both stalled and new projects could
bolster growth. And over the longer term, the public investment program and the successful
implementation of the government’s wide-ranging structural reform program could increase
productivity and raise potential growth.



On the downside, Cabo Verde faces both external and domestic risks. Externally, its high
dependence on tourism and remittances makes it vulnerable to a further delay in the European

8

CABO VERDE

recovery. In addition, its strong financial ties to Portugal—three of the four largest banks in Cabo
Verde are owned by Portuguese groups—make it vulnerable to a resurfacing of financial stress in
the euro area. Domestic risks are primarily fiscal in nature, given high public debt. Risks in the
financial sector have increased with the economic downturn, and NPLs could aggravate the cycle
through their adverse effect on growth (Box 2).
Box 2. NPLs and Economic Growth
The economic downturn in Cabo Verde has led to a significant increase in non-performing loans (NPLs).
The experience of other countries shows that high NPLs can exert a drag on economic growth. To mitigate this
impact, the central bank should take action to help arrest the rise in NPLs, and ideally also resolve them.
Since the onset of the global financial crisis, Cabo Verde has experienced a sharp increase in NPLs.
Since 2009, the ratio of NPLs to total loans has increased significantly, peaking at 20 percent in September
2013 (though easing to 16 percent by December 2013). Corporates account for about two-thirds of the NPL
stock, with NPLs concentrated in tourism, transport, business and construction. Households account for the
remaining third of the NPL stock, with the impaired portfolio concentrated in mortgages.
Economic studies have found a link between high NPLs and economic growth, with intermediation
declining as impaired assets rein in bank profitability. A number of empirical studies have established a
strong, albeit short-lived feedback effect from bank losses on economic activity. To cite a few results,
Espinoza and Prasad (2010) found an elasticity of 0.4 for NPLs on non-oil growth in the Gulf Cooperation
Council (1995–2008). Nkusu (2011) found an elasticity of 0.6 over three years looking at the experience of
26 advanced countries (1999–2009). And Klein (2013) found an elasticity of 0.6 over two years in a group of
Central Eastern and South Eastern Europe (1998–2011). While caution is warranted in applying these results to
Cabo Verde, they do suggest that the recent increase in NPLs entails risks for growth.
The BCV has taken an active role in addressing the NPL situation in Cabo Verde. Following the sharp runup in NPLs in 2012, the BCV conducted a detailed review of the quality of assets for the top clients of the
largest banks, with the aim of assessing their provisioning and NPL disclosure practices. The BCV established
that procedures were not standard across the banks and asked all banks to adopt stringent IFRS compliant
definitions. They developed a credit impairment index to encourage transparency on NPLs and asked banks to
cease dividend payments in 2013. The BCV also undertakes post-balance sheet submission adjustments to
enforce provisioning standards.
The pace of write-offs has been slow so far, reflecting the weak economic situation, lengthy foreclosure
processes, and underdeveloped markets for distressed real estate assets. While speeding up the reduction
of NPLs is desirable, the capacity of banks to absorb further losses is limited. High NPLs are exerting pressure
on banks’ balance sheets, with profitability, as proxied by return on equity, declining to 2.3 percent in 2013
from 9.1 percent in 2010. Capital adequacy dropped from a comfortable cushion of 15.6 percent in 2010 to
12.1 percent in 2012, before recovering to 13.3 percent in 2013.
The BCV is encouraged to take the following steps to support the resolution of the NPL overhang:



continue to monitor banks closely, and intervene preemptively to reinforce resilience of their positions;



encourage banks to strengthen and enforce loss recognition and provisioning standards;



provide proper guidance on loan restructuring, collateral valuation and asset classification;



align current accounting and disclosure practices on loan quality and provisioning to best practices; and



study backlogged cases and develop an action plan to tackle delays in judicial processes.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Policy discussions focused on four key challenges facing Cabo Verde today. First, with public
debt already at high levels, can fiscal policy still play a major role in supporting long-term
growth? Second, given monetary policy’s primary objective of safeguarding the peg, is there
scope to loosen the monetary policy stance in support of the recovery? Third, how has the
downturn affected financial stability? And fourth, what can be done to increase competitiveness
and improve the long-term outlook for growth? These issues are central to ensuring
macroeconomic and debt sustainability in the near term, and for helping Cabo Verde shift to a
productivity-led growth strategy over the medium term.

A. Balancing Fiscal Consolidation with Support for Long-Term Growth
13.
The challenge for fiscal policy is to strike the right balance between supporting growth
and preserving macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability. The IMF has supported
Cabo Verde’s strategy to use concessional resources to finance public investment that boosts the
country’s long-term growth potential. It has also seen a role for public investment to cushion the
impact of the global downturn. However, as noted in the 2012 Article IV consultation, ambitious
medium-term fiscal consolidation is essential to secure debt sustainability and rebuild fiscal
positions. With public debt now approaching 100 percent of GDP, ambitious fiscal adjustment has
become even more urgent (Text Figure 1). This view is shared by the World Bank and other
members of the Budget Support Group.5 It is also shared by rating agencies. In March 2014, Fitch
downgraded Cabo Verde's long-term foreign and local currency ratings from B+ to B, citing a
significant deterioration in the fiscal outlook and a weaker outlook for economic growth.

14.
The authorities' 2014 budget entails an increase in the deficit and total financing
needs, while their medium-term fiscal plans set out a relatively small consolidation effort.6
For 2014, the budget entails a deficit of about 9 percent of GDP, over 1 percentage point higher
than in 2013 (Text Table 1).7 8 Including onlending, total financing needs would reach 13½ percent
of GDP. For 2015–17, the MTFF’s expenditure plans (including onlending) would cause public debt
to exceed 110 percent of GDP by 2017.
15.
Staff recommended more ambitious fiscal consolidation to reduce the risk of debt
distress, support investor confidence, and bolster international reserves. By reducing the need
for domestic financing, there would be more room for credit to the economy, which would support
the shift to private-sector led growth. In addition, by winding down the public investment program
more quickly, external debt would grow less rapidly, thereby reducing external vulnerabilities and
bolstering investor confidence. The impact on the balance of payments would likely be positive, with
private capital flows picking up as external risk declines.
16.
Staff’s recommendations would deliver steady deficit reduction over the coming years,
thereby demonstrating the authorities’ commitment to fiscal consolidation. For 2014, staff
recommended expenditure cuts of about 1 percentage point of GDP, and a similar reduction in
public investment financed by onlending. Staff also recommended that major new public investment
projects meet stringent tests of value-for-money. With current expenditure budgeted to increase by
4 percentage points of GDP, staff saw scope to contain spending, especially in the area of goods
and services. For 2015–17, staff recommended a more cautious public investment plan and slower
growth in some current expenditure items (while protecting social spending). Staff’s proposed path
would reduce the fiscal deficit by over 5 percentage points of GDP between 2013 and 2017, and
total financing by 9½ percentage points—about 4½ percentage points more than envisaged in the
authorities’ plans. Public debt would be considerably lower in the adjustment scenario, falling below
100 percent of GDP by 2017. In light of the weaker growth outlook, the consolidation path
recommended by staff is more gradual than had been proposed in the last Article IV Consultation.

6

The authorities’ fiscal plans are set out in the Medium-Term Fiscal Framework (MTFF), which covers 2014–17.

7

Staff’s projection for 2014 is based on the MTFF’s expenditure plans, with the exception of debt service, for which
staff use the projections agreed by the World Bank and the Ministry of Finance’s Debt Directorate, in the context of
the Medium-Term Debt Strategy exercise (MTDS). The latter exclude an “exchange rate buffer”, included in the
budget to cover unexpected exchange rate swings, which averages about 0.4 percent of GDP for 2014–16.

8

The budget deficit target is 8 percent of GDP. However, staff sees downside revenue risks of over 1 percent of GDP.

Further efforts to enhance domestic resource mobilization will be critical to support
consolidation, and also to prepare Cabo Verde for the phasing out of concessional financing.
Staff welcomed the many important achievements during 2013, including the harmonization and
streamlining of VAT rates, the passage of three new tax codes, and the launch of a large taxpayer
office. The authorities have also focused on enhancing the efficiency of tax administration, by
reforming the Directorate of Contributions and Taxes (DCI). Further improvements in taxpayer
services and a smooth merger of customs and revenue administration remain important priorities.
Staff welcomed plans to resolve sizeable tax arrears (about 4 percent of GDP), as well as outstanding
claims for tax refunds (about 1½ percent of GDP).9
18.
With regards to public financial management, the authorities have also made
considerable progress. They have developed sound fiscal forecasting tools, introduced a mediumterm fiscal framework, aligned their budget and planning processes, and introduced program-based
budgeting. As recommended by FAD, more prioritization amongst the ongoing reforms, as well as
detailed implementation arrangements, would contribute towards their success. Strengthening the
coordination unit at the Ministry of Finance and Planning would also help. FAD has noted that under
current procurement practices, which devolve such responsibilities to line ministries, there is a risk of
unmonitored arrears. For this reason, they have recommended introducing robust commitment
controls and improving the monitoring of arrears.

9

To encourage payment of tax arrears, the Ministry of Finance has offered to waive overdue interest on amounts
due. With regard to claims for tax refunds, the 2014 budget allocates 0.6 percent of GDP towards settling such claims
and other refunds. The authorities are also preparing a full database of tax refunds due.

19.
The performance of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) is improving, but further reforms
are needed to increase efficiency and reduce contingent financial liabilities for the
government. In 2012, the six largest SOEs registered total losses of 0.7 percent of GDP and debt of
27 percent of GDP. Preliminary estimates indicate that performance in 2013 was better. The national
electricity and water provider (ELECTRA) has adopted a cost-based pricing mechanism and a resultsbased management contract—the first amongst the SOEs. The national airline (TACV) aims to
complete the sale of its baggage handling branch by end-2014, but needs further urgent reforms to
reduce losses and resolve sizeable domestic arrears. At the housing agency IFH, potential contingent
fiscal liabilities arising from the social housing program “Casa Para Todos” (with a total program cost
of €170 million over 2011–17, or 11 percent of 2014 GDP) require careful monitoring.10 In light of the
potential financial risks of the program, the authorities should take a careful, phased approach to its
development.
Authorities' views and recent measures
20.
The authorities underscored their commitment to preserving macroeconomic stability.
As noted in their Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper III (GPRSP-III), Cabo Verde would
not have been so successful if it had not prioritized macroeconomic stability as the core factor of
good governance. Now, in the face of the country’s reduced capacity to borrow, it has become
critical to bolster domestic revenue mobilization in order to ensure macroeconomic stability.
A broad set of reforms has already been implemented to streamline and rationalize tax policies in
line with international best practice, and efforts are underway to increase the efficiency of tax
administration.
21.
The authorities emphasized that as in previous years, expenditure containment
measures would be taken if revenue underperformed. A budget re-programming exercise—
covering 2014 and the medium term—will take place in the second quarter of this year, once
revenue performance in the first quarter is known. After the mission, the authorities informed staff
that they had already decided on preliminary expenditure containment measures for 2014–17 that
will lower expenditure by about 1½ percentage points of GDP per year. About half of the reduction
would be in goods and services, with the rest split evenly between other current expenditure and
capital expenditure. The authorities also noted that further cuts could be taken, if needed.11
22.
With regards to capital expenditure, the authorities highlighted the window of
opportunity Cabo Verde still had to draw on concessional resources to finance critical
infrastructure projects. By addressing key bottlenecks, the PIP is boosting the country’s long-term
growth potential and has helped protect the economy from the global downturn. The authorities

10

The program entails building affordable housing units financed by external funds, which will be sold by the
government to private individuals. The program is subject to financial risks, given that purchasers will need to be able
to obtain a mortgage to purchase a property.
11

Following parliamentary approval of the budget, the government can cut expenditure without obtaining additional
parliamentary approval, since the original budget already entailed freezing certain amounts of expenditure pending
satisfactory revenue performance.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

underscored that they are working closely with the World Bank to adopt a national investment
review board, to ensure that approved projects meet stringent rate-of-return criteria.
Staff evaluation and debt sustainability analysis
23.
While staff welcomes the authorities’ initial package of expenditure containment
measures, a considerably greater consolidation effort will be needed to put public debt on a
faster downward trajectory and reduce significant external vulnerabilities (Text Figure 2).
The revised MTFF projections are based on the authorities’ revised nominal expenditure
projections, including the containment measures, but using the Medium-Term Debt Strategy (MTDS)
projections for debt service (Tables 3a and 3b). The baseline projections for GDP growth and
revenue are those of staff; both are somewhat below those of the authorities. While this revised
spending path does bring down financing needs, public debt would still peak at 108 percent of GDP
in 2016–17. In staff’s recommended adjustment scenario, public debt would peak at 103 percent of
GDP, and fall below 100 percent of GDP by 2017.

24.
Based on the authorities’ revised expenditure projections, Cabo Verde’s external debt
risk rating is assessed as “moderate” (Debt Sustainability Analysis Annex). While no threshold
is breached under the baseline, both debt-to-GDP and debt service-to-revenue thresholds are
breached in the one-time depreciation shock scenario. However, risks to overall debt sustainability
remain high. The fact that the NPV of external debt peaks at 49 percent—just shy of the 50 percent
threshold in the baseline—points to significant vulnerabilities. Cabo Verde is also vulnerable to
contingent liabilities from the debt of SOEs. As discussed in the DSA Annex, having to take on even
part of these liabilities through external loans (given legal constraints on domestic financing) would
cause Cabo Verde’s risk rating to increase to “high”. Reducing the risk of debt distress will therefore
depend critically on accelerating fiscal consolidation and advancing structural reforms to boost
growth and enhance the efficiency of the public sector.

B. Balancing a Strong Peg with Support for the Recovery
25.
Cabo Verde’s monetary policy is geared towards maintaining a level of foreign
exchange reserves that is consistent with safeguarding the peg. Following a 150 basis points
policy rate increase in January 2012, international reserves recovered from minimally adequate levels
in 2012, to about 4¼ months of prospective imports at end-2013—within the range estimated as
adequate by staff research. They also cover 70 percent of emigrant deposits (which account for
40 percent of total deposits) and 25 percent of M2. The peg has served the economy well, given
Cabo Verde's strong trade and financial ties to the euro area. An assessment using CGER-type
methodologies indicates that the real exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals (Box 1).
26.
Given weak economic growth, low inflation, and the stabilization of international
reserves, staff saw scope for a cautious loosening of the monetary policy stance. A cut in the
policy rate would send an important signal about the direction of monetary policy, even if
weaknesses in the transmission mechanism would limit its impact on market rates. With regards to a
possible negative impact on capital flows, staff noted that the very high spread between rates in
Cabo Verde and in advanced economy markets made this unlikely. On the contrary, if a rate cut was
seen as supporting a recovery in credit and growth, it could actually lead to higher inflows.12
27.
Staff also recommended reducing the 18 percent minimum reserve requirement,
which is relatively high compared to peers. This would free up liquidity and could support credit
creation. Having said this, staff stressed the importance of close monitoring of liquidity conditions,
and advised readiness to step up sterilization if international reserves came under pressure.
28.
Strengthening the transmission mechanism remains an important objective to
enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy. The policy rate is currently not playing the role of a
reference rate. Strengthening the BCV’s liquidity management could help to align the policy rate
with market rates. Reforms to develop the government securities market, with the aim of developing
a (non-segmented) market-based term structure of interest rates, are also needed. In this regard,
particular care should be taken so that large public institutions do not distort pricing when investing
in this market. More broadly, reforms that enhance the framework for monetary operations would
also contribute to enhancing the effectiveness of monetary policy (Table 6).
29.
With regards to international reserves, the BCV sought to explore options to shore up
Cabo Verde’s resilience to capital outflows. While emigrant deposits have shown welcome
stability over many years, a confidence shock could result in significant emigrant capital flight and
present risks to the financial system. One possible mechanism to shore up international reserves
would be to make the foreign assets held by the “International Support for Cape Verde Trust Fund”
accessible to the BCV, when needed. This is an avenue worth exploring further, and on which MCM
stands ready to provide guidance.

12

Remittances have been found to be positively correlated with Cabo Verde’s GDP growth (A. Shanghavi, Country
Report No. 08/243). The impact of interest rate differentials was weaker.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

CABO VERDE

Authorities' views and recent measures
30.
The BCV agreed with the staff’s recommendation to lower the policy rate, given less
favorable economic conditions, and in the absence of imminent pressures on the balance of
payments or consumer prices. The policy rate was cut by 150 basis points—to 4.25 percent—on
March 1, 2014. The rediscount rate and the BCV’s lending facility rate were cut by the same amount,
to 8.25 percent and 7.25 percent, respectively. The aim of these measures is to help stimulate
financing for viable investment projects, and thereby support the recovery. The BCV emphasized
that the impact of these measures will be enhanced if they are combined with structural measures
that help reduce risks and bolster potential growth.
31.
The BCV noted that the impact of a rate cut on lending rates was unlikely to be
significant, given weaknesses in the transmission mechanism. In discussing the recent
disappointing performance of the interbank market (with no trades since 2012), the BCV explained
that this was due to the fact that all banks have excess liquidity. The BCV requested further TA on
liquidity management, in particular for retaining control over the monetary base (and international
reserves) when the BCV intervenes to help banks facing a short-term liquidity need.13
32.
With regards to the minimum reserve requirement (MRR), the BCV was of the view
that it should be maintained at 18 percent. The BCV considers the MRR an important prudential
tool, whose level should be determined by the stage of development and potential fragilities of the
financial sector. They also noted that it was not a good idea to change the MRR too frequently (and
it had only just been increased 2 years ago). Viewed from a historical context, the BCV considers the
current level of the MRR—at 18 percent—as not very high (though the BCV acknowledged that it is
high compared to peers). Furthermore, the BCV noted the constraints that the fixed exchange rate
regime places on monetary policy, in particular given that about 40 percent of the funding of banks
consists of emigrant deposits.
Staff evaluation
33.
With the recent cut in the policy rate, staff assesses the stance of monetary policy as
appropriate. Over time, this lower policy rate should help bring down market rates, which in turn
would catalyze credit creation and support growth. In addition, if banks are successful in reducing
the NPL overhang and with improving growth prospects, risk aversion may come down, which could
reduce the need for precautionary excess liquidity. Given the weak transmission of monetary policy
(either through changes in the policy rate or by releasing required reserves) and existing excess
liquidity, financial sector reforms that address this weakness remain urgent.

13

An MCM TA mission on liquidity management took place in April 2014.

C. Reinforcing Financial Stability through the Economic Downturn
34.
While financial stability risks have increased with the economic downturn, the BCV has
acted on various fronts to address these risks. The central bank has adopted a more stringent
definition of NPLs (using IAS/IFRS standards), has undertaken an asset impairment review for the top
100 clients of systemic banks, and has issued guidance to banks to suspend dividend payments
(which was done for 2012, and may also be done for 2013) . The BCV also issued new regulations
that harmonize asset quality classification and provisioning standards, which are in effect as of
December 2013. Cabo Verde is supported by MCM TA aimed at strengthening the financial stability
framework (including bank supervision, crisis management and contingency planning; see
Informational Annex). Progress continues to be made in implementing the recommendations of the
2009 Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP), especially in the areas of bank supervision and
the legal and regulatory framework (Table 6). An important achievement was the recent enactment
of the Basic Banking Law and the Financial Institutions Law, which will enhance the BCV’s powers to
strengthen oversight (including of the offshore sector) and implement regulatory reforms. The new
financial laws will also strengthen the framework for insolvency, by enabling the use of progressive
enforcement measures, early intervention and a broad range of resolution and liquidation tools.
The next step is to draw up implementing regulations, which will also provide the opportunity to
address some recommendations provided by MCM on the new laws.14
35.
Staff encouraged the BCV to press ahead with efforts to address remaining priorities
from the FSAP agenda. Amongst these, staff considers enhancing banking supervision and putting
in place robust policies for crisis management as particularly important. The BCV should step up
further its supervision of banks (to ensure proper classification of NPLs and proper provisioning),
and reach understandings with bank owners on how to deal with possible liquidity and/or solvency
threats. In particular, it should work closely with the bank whose CAR has fallen just below the
10 percent minimum, to ensure that it rebuilds its capital quickly. Strengthening collaboration
between the BCV and the Ministry of Finance—in particular by making the Financial Stability
Committee fully operational—remains essential to enhance crisis preparedness at the institutional
level. The BCV's Financial Stability Report, which compares favorably with its peers, could be
strengthened further by linking assessments over time (to clarify where the principal changes have
taken place), strengthening the forward-looking orientation of the report by using early warning
tools and qualitative surveys, and including more analytical topics (Box 3).

14

LEG had provided extensive TA to the BCV when the financial laws were drafted, and stands ready to provide
further support as implementing regulations are drawn up.

Box 3. Cabo Verde’s Financial Stability Report
The Banco de Cabo Verde (BCV) began publishing a Financial Stability Report (FSR) in 2008. The BCV’s
FSR compares well with FSRs issued by peer countries, in particular with regards to the consistency of
covering key stability risks, and also its increasing use of more sophisticated assessment tools like stress tests.
Some suggestions for further enhancements are provided below, drawing on international best practices.
Over the last 20 years, Financial Stability Reports (FSRs) have come to play a key role as a financial
sector surveillance tool. Since they are published on a regular basis, FSRs provide a good perspective on
emerging risks and adverse trends that might threaten the financial system. By alerting financial institutions
and market participants to the possible collective impact of their actions, FSRs can help prepare the ground
for a collaborative and informed approach when confronted with a crisis. Publishing FSRs subjects the
analysis of central banks to public scrutiny, which improves accountability and transparency. FSRs can also
help encourage greater cooperation between central banks and ministries of finance, in particular if they are
a regular agenda item of joint committees that focus on stability, crisis preparedness and management.
Most central banks are publishing FSRs. The first FSRs were issued in Europe in 1995; the first FSR in subSaharan Africa (SSA) was issued in 2004, by the South African Reserve Bank (SARB). The BCV launched its FSR
in 2008 with the goal of identifying, analyzing and monitoring current and potential risks to the financial
system. Like most central banks, the BCV publishes its FSR on a semi-annual basis, to capture in a timely
manner emerging risks to financial stability. To assess the risks, most FSRs utilizes indicators related to
macroeconomic aggregates, financial soundness, early warning, and market based and qualitative indicators.
The BCV’s FSR compares well to FSRs issued by peers in SSA. The BCV started publishing its FSR
relatively early (about four years after the SARB), and in the absence of a financial crisis (unlike most peers).
Using an approach based on the “CCC” framework (assessing the report’s clarity, consistency and coverage)1
FSRs published by the BCV (2008–13) were compared with those published by peer central banks of Ghana,
Mauritius, Namibia and South Africa. As the BCV has gained more experience, the content of the report has
been strengthened, and more data is being provided. Over time, there has been good consistency in
covering key stability risks, as well as sectors like the insurance markets, payment systems and the regulatory
framework. The use of more sophisticated tools like stress tests (adopted in 2009 after Cabo Verde’s FSAP)
has increased over time, and has enhanced the forward-looking orientation of the report.
Drawing on international best practices, the BCV’s FSR could be strengthened further as follows:



improving the linkages between assessments over time, to clarify main changes in the assessment;



strengthening forward orientation, by using early warning tools and surveys (e.g., Bank Lending Survey);



focusing more on the interconnectedness of banks, to avoid missing risks to financial stability;



exploring the introduction of a non-core part of the report where issues for follow up, selected articles,
collaborative studies or papers on topical issues are discussed; and



including the BCV’s definition of financial stability and the aims of the FSR in each report, to improve
users’ understanding of the purpose of the report.

Martin Čihák (2006) “How Do Central Banks Write on Financial Stability?” IMF Working Paper WP/06/163

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CABO VERDE

Authorities' views
36.
The BCV explained the recent steps they have taken to shore up financial stability.
Banks have been required to strengthen their provisions and, in cases of insufficiency, they must
register these insufficiencies immediately in their financial statements. The BCV is also monitoring
write-offs of fully provisioned NPLs very closely, and explained that a new BCV regulation requires
banks to regularly report all impaired loans to the BCV.
37.
The BCV noted that the coverage ratio of provisions is actually higher than indicated
by headline measures. All banks were asked to harmonize their accounting provisions by endDecember 2013. Where relevant, the BCV identified underprovisioning in banks’ financial reports
and deducted the estimated underprovisioning from bank capital, reporting this as “adjusted”
capital. Based on the harmonization exercise, if the value of the provisions recorded in the financial
statements is included, the coverage ratio of provisions improves to 55 percent for credits more than
30 days overdue, and 70 percent for credits more than 90 days overdue.

D. Bolstering Competitiveness to Sustain Inclusive Growth
38.
To sustain robust and inclusive growth over the medium term, Cabo Verde needs to
make further progress in addressing shortcomings in competitiveness. The country made
significant strides in recent years, moving up in the World Economic Forum’s (WEF) Global
Competitiveness rankings from 146th in 2010 to 122nd in 2012. And as noted in Box 1, the exchange
rate is assessed as broadly in line with long-term fundamentals. However, compared to its peers in
the region, Cabo Verde still lags behind in a number of areas that matter for global competitiveness.
It has also demonstrated greater macroeconomic vulnerabilities than its peers (Figure 3).
39.
Improving the performance of the labor market is particularly important to increase
productivity, raise employment, and reduce inequality. The WEF ranks Cabo Verde 129th out of
148 countries for labor market efficiency. A new Labor Code—which is being finalized through
broad-based consultation with stakeholders—should help reduce inflexibility with regards to
working hours, disciplinary measures, and redundancy regulations. In addition to making labor
regulations more employment-friendly, the authorities should explore providing more funding for
vocational training and other skills enhancement. This would help address the skill mismatch, which
has been found to be an important factor in explaining the decline in total factor productivity
(Appendix I).
40.
Cabo Verde has continued to do exceptionally well in the area of social development,
putting achievement of all MDGs by 2015 within reach. Staff took note of the ambitious and
comprehensive strategy set out in the GPRSP-III to promote economic growth, create jobs, and
reduce poverty. Even as the country overall has done well, poverty and unemployment remain
troublesome in rural and agricultural areas—and among women overall—where the incidence is
higher. This calls for policies that focus in particular on increasing opportunities for groups that are
doing less well. Given constraints on financial resources and capacity, further prioritization of the
objectives of the GPRSP-III would help achieve goals with the highest social and economic return.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

CABO VERDE

Authorities’ views
41.
Improving the business climate is a key feature of the government's medium-term
growth and development plan (GPRSP-III). Enhancing labor market flexibility, bolstering
productivity, and improving the quality and relevance of education and training are central to the
authorities’ reform agenda. The authorities also noted that while some indices may rank Cabo Verde
low on competitiveness, others rank them much higher—for example, they noted that the country is
now ranked 60th out of 160 countries in the Heritage Foundation’s Economic Freedom Index.
42.
With regards to social development, the authorities expressed their strong
commitment to reducing inequality in income and increasing employment opportunities.
The GPRSP-III seeks to reduce these inequalities through policies that promote pro-poor growth, for
example by targeting training resources for workers in the farming and informal sectors, investing in
infrastructure in less-advantaged areas, and strengthening linkages between tourism and other parts
of the economy (especially agriculture).

STAFF APPRAISAL
43.
Cabo Verde finds itself at an important juncture in its economic development, with
capital investment waning as a driver of growth. For the transition to a productivity-led economy
to be successful, an ambitious structural reform agenda is needed to address challenges to
competitiveness. Maintaining robust growth over the medium term is certainly achievable, but far
from given, with the historical experience of micro and small economies indicating an average long
term growth rate of 3–4 percent. At the same time, given Cabo Verde’s high public debt, a strong
commitment to fiscal consolidation is critical to support macroeconomic stability.
44.
In the near term, the outlook for economic growth is improving, though subject to
some downside risks. With demand from major trading partners expected to pick up, tourism
should continue to do well, and FDI to recover. And as banks work through the NPL overhang, a
modest increase in credit growth could help fuel an incipient recovery in domestic demand.
45.
For 2014, the macroeconomic policy stance is now broadly appropriate, though it
required a shift in the policy mix and a reduction in the fiscal deficit. In the face of sharply
lower investment and depressed private consumption, there has been a need for policies to support
economic activity. And with the outlook for growth still moderate and uncertain, staff sees a
continued role for accommodative policies. However, given the high level of public debt, staff
recommended a more ambitious fiscal consolidation path than envisioned by the authorities. In
addition, while the expenditure containment measures agreed after the mission are welcome, it
would have been preferable for the original budget to set out a more realistic expenditure path,
given likely risks to revenue. With regards to monetary policy, in the absence of pressures on the
external position or on prices, staff welcomed the decision to loosen the monetary policy stance in
support of the recovery.

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CABO VERDE

46.
Looking farther ahead, ambitious fiscal consolidation holds the key to
ensuring macroeconomic stability and providing a sound basis for private sector-led growth.
The large-scale public investment program has helped close infrastructure gaps and cushion the
economy from the impact of the global financial crisis. However, with debt now approaching
100 percent of GDP, a strong commitment to bringing down debt is needed to reinforce Cabo
Verde’s reputation of sound macroeconomic management, and also to create room for financing
private sector growth. Staff therefore welcomes the authorities’ decision to adopt expenditure
containment measures (for 2014 and beyond), though recommends that further containment
measures be taken to put Cabo Verde on a faster downward trajectory for public debt.
47.
The fixed exchange rate regime has anchored macroeconomic stability in Cabo Verde,
and external stability does not appear to be at risk. However, with its high dependence on
tourism and remittances, Cabo Verde remains vulnerable to changes in external conditions.
This underscores the importance of adopting reforms that enhance competitiveness and support
economic diversification. At the same time, cautious macroeconomic management remains essential
to safeguard the peg and macroeconomic stability more generally.
48.
Cabo Verde’s Third Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (GPRSP-III) provides
the country with a sound blueprint for achieving these aims. The GPRSP-III presents an
ambitious and comprehensive strategy to promote economic growth, create jobs, and reduce
poverty. Given constraints on resources—both financial and in terms of capacity—staff recommends
further prioritization amongst the goals set out in the strategy, focusing efforts on those where the
economic and social returns are expected to be highest.
49.
While data are adequate for surveillance purposes, some key shortcomings remain.
National accounts data are released with a significant lag and only on an annual basis.
This represents a serious obstacle to macroeconomic policy formulation. STA has provided technical
assistance in this area, focusing most recently on quarterly national accounts data. The authorities
are taking steps to improve the provision of statistics, but still face both financial and human
resource constraints.
50.
Staff urges the authorities to consent to the 2010 IMF Quota and Voice reforms.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard 12 month cycle.

Prolonged stagnation would depress exports, remittances, and

High
While the authorities have committed to

the 2014 budget is expansionary
and 2015 is a pre-election year.

High
A perceived lack of commitment to fiscal consolidation could
seriously undermine investor perceptions of macroeconomic
stability, reducing capital inflows and weakening confidence in the
peg. It could also reduce concessional support from development
partners, who have underscored the importance of fiscal
consolidation.

Medium
The outlook is for reserves coverage to
remain at about 4½ months of imports
over the medium term. However, a
sharper-than-expected increase in
imports or shortfall in capital inflows
could weaken the balance of payments.

High
A decline in the reserves coverage could undermine confidence in
the peg, which could lead to a further decline in private inflows
and remittances. A policy response of tightening monetary policy
would weaken the recovery, while an imposition of capital
controls would undermine investor confidence.

Medium

Medium

NPLs have risen significantly in the last
two years, reflecting the decline in
economic activity but also intensified
supervision. With the economy still weak,
NPLs could rise further. Associated bank
losses could result in capital shortfalls.

The banking system as a whole is fairly well capitalized, which
reduces the potential cost of a bank failure. In addition, with most
banks having majority foreign ownership, outside capital would
likely be available to recapitalize a failed bank. However, there is
little fiscal space to finance any public bail-out.

Medium
The authorities have adopted a detailed
agenda to reform SOEs. However,
implementation could be delayed due to
political economy challenges.

Medium
Financial weaknesses in some of the largest SOEs represent
contingent liabilities for the government. As of end-2012, the debt
of SOEs amounted to 27 percent of GDP. Persistent weak financial
performance of SOEs could crowd out public investment and

Appendix I. Raising Potential Growth in Cabo Verde1
Over the last two decades, Cabo Verde’s rapid economic growth has allowed it to
graduate to middle-income country status. In recent years, growth has been driven
primarily by factor inputs, with productivity playing a fairly small (and declining) role.
For Cabo Verde to remain on the path towards upper-middle income status, reforms that
boost productivity will be essential. These include easing the regulatory burden in the
labor market, reducing the skills mismatch, improving the business environment for local
entrepreneurs and SMEs, and enhancing the efficiency of key public services.

Cabo Verde’s Economic Development and Recent Challenges
1.

Cabo Verde has achieved impressive gains in social and economic development over the

past two decades. Good governance, sound macroeconomic policies, and structural reforms have
attracted foreign direct investment and significant donor financing. Annual real GDP growth
average over 6 percent during 2000–07, faster than most small island economies and the average
for sub-Saharan Africa. As a result, Cabo Verde reached middle income country (MIC) status in
December 2007.
2.

To continue along its transition towards upper middle income level, Cabo Verde must now

address new challenges. First, the crucial growth engines of the Cabo Verdean economy have been
tourism, tourism-related foreign investment, and construction, all of which are greatly
dependent upon the global economy. Second, the large-scale public investment program launched
in 2008—which has contributed significantly to growth—is expected to wind down soon, as
Cabo Verde’s access to grants and concessional financing ends. Third, Cabo Verde faces
considerable structural limits to sustaining high growth over the medium term. The growth
experience of micro and small middle income countries shows that long-term growth has averaged
around 3 to 4 percent (Table 1).

Countries of SSA” (Country Report No. 14/41).

3.

A growth accounting framework can help explain the dynamics of economic growth in

Cabo Verde. The framework decomposes output growth into (i) the contributions from increases in
the amount of factor inputs—namely physical capital, and human capital-augmented labor—and
(ii) the growth residual which cannot be accounted for by observed increases in factor inputs (Solow,
1957).2 The contribution of capital input is calculated from the estimated capital stock—using the
standard perpetual inventory model with geometric depreciation—weighted by the income share of
capital. Meanwhile, the contribution of human capital-augmented labor input is derived from the
estimated human capital stock—using the average educational attainment of the employed labor
and the estimated returns to education—weighted by the income share of labor. With this growth
decomposition, the growth residual indicates a change in technological progress and is known as
total factor productivity (TFP). TFP affects economic growth through improvement in resource
allocation, innovation, and productivity of each of the factor inputs. Therefore, rising TFP provides an
economy with the opportunity to grow more efficiently, and thus, more sustainably in the long run.

Raising Potential Growth in Small Middle Income Countries of SubSaharan Africa
5.

The growth experience of Cabo Verde—with a period of rapid growth and high resource

accumulation followed by a period of slow growth and falling TFP—is also found in other small
middle income countries in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA SMICs). The growth slowdown prevents
countries from reaching upper middle income and high income status—a phenomenon known as
the “middle income trap”.3 To overcome this challenge, SSA SMICS—including Cabo Verde—need
to revisit their growth model and identify new, higher-productivity drivers of growth.

The experience of SSA SMICs suggests a two-stage trend in TFP and thus economic growth:

capital deepening during the high growth period, and economic concentration and regulatory
constraints in the slower growth period (Table 2). In the earlier decades, when global economic
conditions where relatively supportive, SSA SMICs undertook capital deepening in the form of
infrastructure investment and higher FDI to bolster productivity and growth. However, in the last few
years, as the external environment deteriorated, the growth momentum in SSA SMICs weakened.
The structural reforms that would have sustained the growth of TFP—such as those that encouraged
economic diversification, and helped create a business friendly environment—were not fully
implemented. In addition, their highly restrictive regulatory systems, albeit in different markets, and
large public sector hinder productivity gains by raising production costs, and thus, reducing
investment efficiency.
7.

Cross-country empirical analysis can help shed light on the role of macroeconomic,

structural, and institutional factors in TFP growth. Three econometric methodologies are applied to
an (unbalanced) panel dataset of 33 middle-income countries (MICs) during the 1981–2010 period.
First, the dynamic panel regressions are estimated to control for time-invariant country fixed effects,
using the generalized method of moments.4 Second, the co-integration analysis is used to identify
and estimate the long-run relationship between TFP and its determinants. And third, a panel Probit
analysis is conducted to identify the factors that contribute to TFP growth. The cross-country panel

dataset is obtained from five primary sources: the Penn World Tables, the IMF’s World Economic
Outlook (WEO), the World Bank’s World Development indicators (WDI), the Economic of Freedom of
the World (EFW) project, and the Barro-Lee database.
8.

The empirical results suggest that macroeconomic stability and trade openness are

necessary but not sufficient conditions for productivity growth (Table 3). MICs need to improve the
quality of human capital to minimize the skills mismatch, reduce the regulatory burden on firms, and
be aware of limits up to which infrastructure gap could be closed by public borrowing. First, the
panel estimation results point to a negative impact of skill-mismatches on the contribution of TFP to
growth.5 They also suggest a concave impact of government debt on TFP contribution. Although
public investment could enhance overall productivity and play an important counter-cyclical role,
it carries risks of inefficient crowding-out similar private sector initiatives.6 Second, turning to the cointegration analysis, most findings are consistent with those of the dynamic panel regressions, with
foreign direct investment (FDI), trade openness, and market capitalization as additional positive
factors for TFP. High inflation is found to reduce TFP growth. In addition to these results, the panel
Probit analysis shows that restrictive labor and credit market regulations have a negative impact on
TFP growth, while the impact of access to credit for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) is positive.

Relevance of the SSA SMICs’ Productivity Analysis for Cabo Verde
9.

The results of the cross-country analysis could help identify factors that are inhibiting TFP in

Cabo Verde. The following factors may be of particular relevance: skill mismatch, labor market
regulations, access to finance by SMEs, and the size of public debt.
10.

Improving the quality and relevance of education and training is crucial to reduce skill

mismatch and generate employment. Skill mismatch has been relatively high in Cabo Verde and
contributed to high unemployment, especially among young people. The unemployment rate was
over 16 percent at end-2013, with youth unemployment more than double that rate. While the
country has significantly improved access to higher education and professional training, it is still not
able to create enough jobs for all new graduates. In 2012, there were around 9,300 formal job
offers for graduates, compared to around 23,000 young people looking for jobs. Cabo Verde's
medium-term development plan for 2012–16—the Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper-III
(GPRSP-III)—seeks to address skill mismatch and unemployment by focusing resources on technical
and vocational training, especially in tourism, agri-business and the creative economy. As funding is
one of the challenges for expanding the education and training development plan, the government
should also encourage more private sector participation in human capital development.

Enhancing labor market efficiency would also bolster competitiveness. Available business

surveys reflect investors’ concerns with heavy labor market regulations. The World Economic Forum
(WEF) ranked Cabo Verde 129th out of 148 countries on labor market efficiency in its 2013/14
Competitiveness Report. In addition, the labor regulation indicators from the Economic Freedom of
the World indices suggest that Cabo Verde’s labor market is more restrictive than other SSA SMICs,
particularly in hiring and wage-setting regulations, hour regulations and dismissal costs. Cabo Verde
is already taking steps to address these inefficiencies. A new labor code is expected to enable a
business climate and job creation by providing more flexibility in terms of working hours,
disciplinary measures and redundancy costs.

Creating a business climate that better supports local entrepreneurs and SMEs would also

play an important role in boosting growth. Given the large informal sector, another effective way
to promote sustainable employment and increase productivity is to support entrepreneurship and
self-employment. As set out in the GPRSP-III, the government aims to develop entrepreneurship by
both expanding training programs in entrepreneurial skills and innovation, and fostering an
enabling business environment. The WEF had also identified access to financing as one of the most
serious obstacles to doing business in Cabo Verde. The GPRSP-III addresses this issue, by setting out
plans to strengthen access to financing by local entrepreneurs and SMEs, encouraging cooperative
behavior, and providing business support infrastructure.
13.

It is also worth considering whether the size of public debt could potentially slow

productivity growth. Since 2008, Cabo Verde's public debt has increased by nearly 40 percentage
points of GDP, reaching an estimated at 95 percent of GDP at end-2013. The significant increase in
public debt reflects in good part a large-scale public investment program, which focuses in
particular on reducing bottlenecks in energy and transportation, which are expected to play a
positive role in boosting productivity. With many of Cabo Verde's infrastructure gaps now having
been addressed (and access to concessional financing likely to end), it is possible that the public
sector could make greater contributions to productivity by focusing more on the efficiency of public
investments rather than by further increasing it. In addition, as the government reduces its draw on
domestic financing, it will create more financing room for the private sector to investment in
innovation and growth.

Conclusion
14.

The cross-country analysis has shown the importance of boosting productivity to achieve

sustainable economic growth in Cabo Verde. Reforms in the following areas look particularly
relevant: reducing skill mismatch and the regulatory burden in the labor market, creating an
enabling business environment for local entrepreneurs and SMEs, and enhancing the efficiency of
public investment. The GPRSP-III sets out many important initiatives in these areas. Steady progress
in implementing these reforms would play a key role in raising TFP in Cabo Verde, and moving
towards upper MIC status.

While Cabo Verde’s debt remains sustainable, it is subject to significant vulnerabilities.
Based on the authorities’ budgetary projections (“baseline”), Cabo Verde’s external debt risk
distress rating is “moderate”. However, total public debt is expected to reach considerably
higher levels over the medium term than projected in the previous Debt Sustainability
Analysis (DSA). This is a dangerous trend, particularly in light of a weaker macroeconomic
outlook and contingent financial liabilities related to state-owned enterprises. Reducing the
risk of debt distress depends critically on accelerating fiscal consolidation and advancing
structural reforms to boost growth and enhance the efficiency of the public sector.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 47

CABO VERDE

BACKGROUND
Over the last five years, Cabo Verde’s public debt has increased significantly, reflecting a
sharp decline in revenue and grants, as well as the ramping up of public investment.
While public and publicly guaranteed debt remains sustainable, it is expected to reach
considerably higher levels over the medium term than projected in the previous DSA, and
is subject to significant vulnerabilities. This is a dangerous trend, particularly in light of a
weaker macroeconomic outlook and contingent financial liabilities related to the debt of
state-owned enterprises. Given these risks, efforts to significantly accelerate fiscal
consolidation, combined with structural reforms that boost productivity and growth, are
essential to improve the debt outlook.
1.
This DSA reflects official debt stock data for end-2012, and additional information
available as of April 2014. The fiscal outturn of 2013 and staff’s fiscal projections for 2014–17
(Table 3a in the Staff Report) are used to project debt-creating flows. The debt data include central
government external and domestic debt, and external debt contracted by the central government
on behalf of state-owned enterprises (also referred to as "onlending"). The data do not include debt
contracted directly by state-owned enterprises and local governments that carry a centralgovernment guarantee; at end-2012, this debt was estimated at about 4 percent of GDP. Estimates
for such publicly-guaranteed debt for 2013, and projections for 2014 and beyond, were not available
at the time of this assessment.
2.
There is little reliable data on external private debt. To estimate this debt, information
from the balance of payments on bank and non-bank liabilities to non-residents is used. On this
basis, private external debt was estimated around 36 percent of GDP at end-2013. The authorities
are compiling information about private sector external debt, but there is a need for a more
systematic monitoring of actual disbursements and repayment flows.
3.
Total public debt in Cabo Verde continued to increase in 2013 as a result of the Public
Investment Program (PIP). The stock of public debt reached 90 percent of GDP in 2012, and is
estimated to have reached 98 percent of GDP at end-2013. The increase in public debt reflects the
still-high financing needs owing to increases in capital spending, and falling tax revenue
as a share of GDP.

While external public debt is high, it is overwhelmingly concessional. Multilateral
institutions, in particular the World Bank Group and the African Development Bank, are the main
external creditors. Cabo Verde’s external public debt has a long maturity profile and low average
interest rates (Text Table 2).

Cabo Verde’s domestic public debt remains at relatively low levels. The government’s
ability to finance the PIP through concessional external loans has helped keep domestic debt low
(24 percent of GDP at end-2013). Moreover, there is a legal limit of 3 percent of GDP on domestic
financing of the deficit per year.1 At end-2012 the National Pension Fund held about 44 percent of
domestic debt, and the rest was held by the banking system. Treasury bonds make up about
94 percent of domestic debt. The average maturity of domestic debt at end-2013 was six years and
the average interest rate was 5.4 percent.
6.
Cabo Verde is a strong policy performer for the purpose of determining the debt
burden thresholds under the Debt Sustainability Framework (DSF). Cabo Verde’s rating on the
World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) averaged 4 (on a scale of 1 to 6)
during 2010–12, making it a strong policy performer. Based on its 2012 CPIA score, Cabo Verde
ranks first among IDA-recipient countries in the sub-Saharan African (SSA) region, and third among
all IDA countries. The corresponding external public debt burden thresholds are shown in
Text Table 3.

In addition to the legal limit on domestic deficit financing, the government has also set the policy objective of
keeping domestic debt below 25 percent of GDP.

BASELINE SCENARIO UNDERLYING THE DEBT
SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
7.
The assumptions underlying the current DSA differ in a number of ways from those
used in the 2012 Article IV Consultation (Text Table 4 and Box 1). While the current
baseline scenario assumes a rebound of economic activity, growth projections in the medium and
long term are about one percentage point lower than in the previous DSA. Growth is also estimated
to have been considerably weaker in 2012 and 2013. The baseline scenario assumes a slower path of
fiscal consolidation, given the delayed economic recovery and higher current account deficit,
reflecting higher imports owing to a slower phasing out of the PIP.

CABO VERDE

Box 1. Cabo Verde: Macroeconomic Assumptions of the Baseline Scenario, 2013–33
Real GDP growth is expected to pick up after the slowdown in 2012-13, and settle at 4 percent per year in
the long term. Growth assumptions are based on continued good performance in the tourism sector,
better conditions in the euro area, resumption of private credit growth, some product diversification into
areas like agriculture and fisheries, and an increase in productivity owing to payoffs from the Public
Investment Program and from structural reforms.
Fiscal policy. In the medium term (2013–17), the fiscal deficit and overall financing needs are expected to
decline by 2.8 and 6.3 percentage points of GDP, respectively, corresponding to the fiscal consolidation
outlined in the baseline scenario, as set out in paragraph 23 in the Staff Report. Fiscal consolidation is
expected to continue in the long run, with the government continuing to reduce its financing needs as the
concessional borrowing window closes. In the long run (2018-33), with fiscal consolidation complete and
onlending coming to an end, financing needs are projected to stay below 2.5 percent of GDP per year.
The non-interest current account deficit is projected to widen in 2014 owing to the expected increase in
economic activity, public investment and FDI (which will drive up imports) and decline gradually
afterwards, as the Public Investment Program winds down.
Consumer price inflation is projected to remain below 3 percent.
Financing. The concessionality of new external loans will decline significantly starting from 2019, and the
baseline assumes a slightly more accelerated move towards non-concessional financing than the previous
DSA. In addition, the baseline assumes that domestic financing will remain below 3 percent of GDP, in
compliance with the limit set in the Budget Law.

DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
E. External Public Debt
8.
Under the baseline assumptions, all external debt and debt-service ratios remain
below the policy-dependent thresholds throughout the projection period (Figure 1). The
present value (PV) of public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) external debt is expected to peak at
49 percent of GDP in 2016, and then gradually decrease to 28 percent of GDP in 2033 (Figure 1b,
Table 1a). The large increase in the PV of PPG external debt in 2013-14 is due to high public
investment in these years.
9.
Cabo Verde’s external debt sustainability is most sensitive to a one-time depreciation
shock. Under a bound test that entails a 30 percent nominal depreciation shock in 2014, the PV of
the debt-to-GDP ratio would exceed the threshold in the year 2014 and remain above it for more
than a decade (Figure 1b; Table 1b, Scenario B6). The PV of the debt-to-exports ratio would also
breach the threshold under a hardening of financial terms, an export shock, and a GDP deflator
shock (Table 1b, scenario A2, B2, and B3, respectively).
10.
External debt sustainability is also vulnerable to contingent liabilities associated with
the debt of state-owned enterprises (SOEs). At end-2012 (the latest information available), SOEs’
debt that did not carry a government guarantee amounted to 12 percent of GDP. In a shock scenario
where the financial situation of SOEs deteriorates to such an extent that the central government
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

51

CABO VERDE

must take on all of this debt, and respecting legal limits on domestic debt financing, the PV of PPG
external debt reaches the 50 percent threshold under the baseline (Text Figure 1).2

F. Total Public Debt
11.
Total public debt in the baseline scenario peaks at 108 percent of GDP in 2016, and
declines gradually over the projection period (Table 2a). The debt outlook is vulnerable to a
prolonged economic slowdown; a delay of the Euro zone recovery, which would affect growth by
depressing remittances and tourism income; and realization of losses on contingent liabilities
associated with SOEs. With regards to remittances, which accounted for roughly 10 percent of GDP
in 2013, there are also vulnerabilities related to financial stability. While these flows have remained
fairly stable over many years, problems in a systemic bank could cause emigrants to re-assess their
financial investment in Cabo Verde and withdraw their funds. Regarding SOEs, while the financial
situation of ELECTRA has improved during 2013, TACV continues to be in difficult financial
circumstances.

2

The scenario assumes that (i) the stock of non-guaranteed SOE debt held steady in 2013 at the level recorded for
end-2012 (CV$ 18.2 billion) and (ii) the entire stock of this debt is transferred to the central government in 2014.
Assuming that the SOE debt at end-2012 had an average original maturity of 7 years, the government would need to
refinance this debt over 2014–19. The financing to cover this would come from domestic borrowing (up to the legally
binding limit on domestic deficit financing of 3 percent of GDP) and the remainder from external borrowing.

52

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CABO VERDE

12.
Public debt sustainability is sensitive to various alternative scenarios and stress tests
(Table 2b). The expansion of public debt is most pronounced under the scenario which keeps the
primary balance the same as in 2013. However, this scenario appears rather unlikely, given that the
primary balance in 2013 reflected a temporarily high level of public investment. Significantly lower
growth (for a prolonged period or the whole projection horizon) would also cause public debt to
reach unsustainable levels.

G. Comparison with the Previous Debt Sustainability Analysis
13.
While the PV of external debt does not breach the threshold under the baseline
scenario—as was the case in the previous DSA—public debt peaks at a higher level.
The improved assessment under the baseline is due to the increase in the discount rate from 3 to
5 percent.3 However, while in the previous DSA public debt peaked at 92 percent of GDP (in 2015),
in the current DSA it reaches 108 percent in 2016. This is a significant deterioration in the outlook
for public debt, reflecting a combination of weaker economic growth and a slower path of fiscal
consolidation.

H. The Authorities’ Views
14.
The authorities broadly concurred with the results of the DSA, though they saw upside
risks to the assessment. In particular, they noted that by improving Cabo Verde’s infrastructure, the
large-scale public investment program was addressing critical bottlenecks to growth, which would
deliver a more favorable economic performance over the medium term. This would bolster domestic
revenue (which would reduce the deficit) and also raise growth (which would reduce the debt-toGDP ratio).

DEBT DISTRESS CLASSIFICATION AND CONCLUSIONS
15.
Based on the external debt burden indicators, the current DSA finds that Cabo Verde’s
debt is sustainable, and that the risk of debt distress is moderate. None of the debt burden
thresholds is breached over the 20-year projection period under the baseline scenario.
A depreciation shock is the one to which debt sustainability is most sensitive.
16.
However, the rapid accumulation of public debt has increased risks to the baseline,
and points to elevated vulnerabilities. The degree (and timing) of the impact of the public
investment program on growth remains uncertain, prospects for export diversification are
challenging, and SOEs remain in financial difficulties. Given these downside risks, further efforts
should be made to accelerate fiscal consolidation and reduce public debt faster. In addition, the
government should aim to limit its external borrowing to concessional loans.

3

The discount rate for the IMF’s Debt Sustainability Analysis was increased from 3 to 5 percent in 2013 because
globally low interest rates were making it difficult to obtain financing terms that met concessionality requirements.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

Grant element assumed on residual financing (i.e., financing required above baseline) 6/
Sources: Country authorities; and staff estimates and projections.

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.

Safeguards Assessments
Two safeguards assessments of the Bank of Cabo Verde (BCV) have been completed, in 2002 and
2008. The 2008 assessment was conducted at the request of the authorities regarding the Policy
Support Instrument (PSI). It concluded that the BCV had adopted some of the measures
recommended in 2002, but also made recommendations to address further safeguards
vulnerabilities notably in the internal audit mechanism, system of internal controls, and
transparency practices. Although the implementation of certain safeguards recommendations
remains work in progress, the BCV has since improved the completion of the audits and the
publication of audited financial statements on its website.

Exchange Rate Arrangements
The de facto and de jure exchange rate arrangement of Cabo Verde is a conventional fixed peg.
The escudo has been pegged to the euro at a rate of CVE 110.265 per euro since January 4, 1999.
Cabo Verde accepted the obligations of Article VIII of the Articles of Agreement effective July 1,
2004. It maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers for current international transactions.

Previous Article IV Consultation and PSI Reviews
The final review under the 15-month PSI for Cabo Verde was completed on January 30, 2012
(Country Report No. 12/29). The Executive Board concluded the 2012 Article IV consultation on
March 8, 2013 (Country Report No. 13/52).

WORLD BANK AND IMF COLLABORATION
(As of March 31, 2014)
The IMF and the World Bank Cabo Verde teams maintain an ongoing exchange of views on
macroeconomic and structural issues. The cooperation and the coordination include the following:


Article IV Consultations. World Bank representatives attended the Policy Consultation Meeting
for the 2014 Article IV mission brief, and meetings during the 2014 IMF Article IV mission in
Cabo Verde. This facilitated the discussions and provided valuable input, in particular in the
areas of mutual interest such as public financial management and state-owned enterprise
reform.



Joint managerial action plan. The IMF and World Bank teams meet regularly to discuss and
exchange views on relevant issues. The Fund provides macroeconomic framework updates
requested by the Bank for their sectoral work. The Bank’s work program comprises projects in
the following areas: poverty reduction, public sector efficiency, competitiveness and private
sector development, and management of state-owned enterprises (SOEs). The Bank’s tourism
development study was completed in July 2013, while the Country Economic Memorandum was
completed in December 2013, covering the key challenges and structural reforms that could
support productivity-driven growth and broad-based poverty reduction. The Bank’s work in the
coming years will be guided by a Country Partnership Strategy (FY2014–FY2017). The two teams
have also worked closely on issues related to public financial management and a joint debt
sustainability analysis (DSA).



Joint Staff Advisory Note on the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper. The staffs
have prepared a JSAN on the Third Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (GPRSP-III)
2012–16.

The teams plan to continue the close cooperation going forward. The table below describes specific
activities planned by the two country teams over the fiscal years 2014/2015. The Fund will continue
to lead on macroeconomic analysis, and the Bank will continue to lead on developments in
competitiveness and innovation in the private sector (including agriculture) and SOEs. The teams will
cooperate closely in preparing a joint DSA.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
General: Cabo Verde is assessed as “Category A” with regards to data adequacy for surveillance
purposes. While substantial improvements are needed in national accounts, on the whole data
are adequate for surveillance purposes. The country has participated in the General Data
Dissemination System (GDDS) since February 2004. Cabo Verde’s plans for improvements of its
statistical system are posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB); the
metadata of the monetary and financial sector were updated in August 2007. The country has
benefited from IMF Statistics Department (STA) technical assistance under the GDDS project for
Lusophone Africa.
The authorities are taking steps to strengthen statistics, but the statistical system still suffers from
a shortage of financial and human resources. A comprehensive master plan has been developed
under the direction of the National Statistical Institute (INE), which assesses the need for
upgrading the agencies that constitute the statistical system and outlines steps to broaden and
improve all areas of statistics.
National Accounts: Although some improvements have been made to the national accounts,
significant weakness remains — including a lack of timely and accurate GDP numbers. The most
recent annual GDP data are for 2012 (released in March 2014). In the past few years, INE has
worked on a complete overhaul of the national accounts. More specifically, INE has implemented
the estimation of GDP at chained prices—as recommended by the 1993 System of National
Accounts (1993 SNA)—as well as changing the base year from 1980 to 2007. The national
accounts based on the new methodology were presented for the first time in July 2013, for 2011
and the backward projections of the old series for 2002-2010.
With technical assistance from IMF STA National Accounts missions since 2012, INE has also been
working towards the publication of quarterly national accounts. INE plans to publish quarterly
GDP data by 2015.
Full implementation of the 1993 SNA and quarterly national accounts publication require
substantial improvement in source data collection, for which capacity is currently limited.
While capacity of INE staff is found to be overstretched, INE has an ambitious target to continue
building its statistics series—ranging from business, household, and labor force surveys to
governance and security surveys. In addition, INE assesses in detail and corrects individual source
data entries—something not generally undertaken in most countries by national accounts
compilers. Given capacity constraints, a greater prioritization amongst data collection is
encouraged. Further technical assistance on how to preliminarily estimate or extrapolate
economic activity from random sampling surveys in various sectors could lead to crucial
improvement in national accounts estimates and the timeliness of the release.
Price Statistics: A revamped Consumer Price Index (CPI) with new methodology was launched in
February 2008. The previous official CPI was based on weights dating back to 1989, four years
before imports were liberalized. Import liberalization considerably changed consumption
patterns. INE has received assistance, from the National Statistics Institute of Portugal and IMF
STA CPI missions during 2006-2007, to support the introduction and dissemination of the revised
68

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CABO VERDE

CPI. The new index has new weights and an updated commodity basket. Price statistics are
published on a monthly basis and in a timely manner.
Labor market statistics: INE publishes labor market statistics only on an annual basis with long
delays. The annual unemployment data for 2012 were released in the second quarter of 2013.
In addition, there are no published data on wages and employment in different sectors. The labor
force survey is relatively extensive and has a large coverage of around 10,000 households which
are representative at the municipality level.
Government Finance Statistics: The fiscal data have improved. Benefiting from technical
assistance (TA) under the GDDS project for Lusophone Africa, the Government Finance Statistics
(GFS) compilation system is being upgraded. Most deposits previously held with commercial
banks have been consolidated at the central bank. SIGOF, the Integrated Online Budget
Management System, was expanded to cover all semiautonomous institutes and most
municipalities by the end of 2007, and recent TA helped the authorities compile GFS data in line
with GFSM 2001. The authorities have started reporting GFS for publication in the GFS Yearbook.
However, quality is a concern. The fiscal accounts are subject to statistical discrepancies, and
flows and stocks are not always consistent. Tax arrears and overdue tax credits and refunds need
to be better measured and integrated into the budget. Also, institutional coverage of fiscal data
needs to be extended. A significant delay in donor reporting of project financing also affects the
accuracy of fiscal data. Despite the recent revision of external debt data, weaknesses regarding
the public and publically guaranteed debt of state-owned enterprises persist.
Monetary and Financial Statistics: The monetary and financial statistics are adequate and the
quality of the monetary survey has been improved. An STA mission undertaken in March 2007
helped the Banco de Cabo Verde (BCV) to finalize the standardized report forms (SRFs) for
reporting monetary statistics to STA. SRF-based monetary data have been published in the IFS
Supplement since June 2007. These data are fully aligned with the recommendations of the
Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual. An integrated monetary database that meets STA, AFR,
and BCV statistical needs is now in place.
External statistics: The accuracy, periodicity, and timeliness of Balance of Payments (BOP)
statistics compiled by BCV have continued to improve. A greater use of surveys, combined with
the International Transactions Reporting System implemented by the BCV, has permitted a
significant expansion of data sources and statistical coverage, which to a large extent follow the
recommendations of the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5). However,
problems and limitations in data sources and compilation techniques remain and need to be
addressed. Data coverage needs to be strengthened, particularly for foreign trade in goods, direct
investment, portfolio investment liabilities, and the nonbank sector’s external transactions
conducted via accounts held abroad. Dissemination of quarterly BOP data on the BCV website has
been regular. Since 2007, the BCV has resumed regular and timely transmission of these data to
STA for publication in IFS and in the Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Washington, D.C. 20431, USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation1 with Cabo Verde
On May 28, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
2014 Article IV consultation with Cabo Verde.1
The economy of Cabo Verde has continued to face significant headwinds due to the prolonged
downturn in key trading partners in Europe and weak domestic demand. Output growth slowed
from 4 percent in 2011 to 1.2 percent in 2012. Staff estimates that growth moderated further in
2013, to about 0.5 percent. While tourism performed well, remittances and private capital flows
continued to decline, and domestic confidence declined further. The unemployment rate was
16 percent at end-2013, with the rate for youth twice as high. Consumer price inflation has fallen
sharply, reaching 0.6 percent in March 2014. On the external front, the current account deficit is
estimated to have narrowed sharply, contributing to a positive overall balance of payments and
allowing international reserves to increase to roughly 4½ months of prospective imports.
Given weak economic conditions, and in the absence of imminent pressures on the balance of
payments or consumer prices, the Banco de Cabo Verde (BCV) reduced its policy rate by
150 basis points in March 2014. While banks remain well-capitalized, financial stability has been
weakened by the slowdown in economic growth. Non-performing loans have continued to rise,
and by end-2013 accounted for 16 percent of total loans. This has contributed to a decline in
bank profitability.
On the budgetary front, the fiscal deficit fell to 7¾ percent in GDP in 2013, about 2 percentage
points less than the year before. However, total financing needs (including onlending to state-

owned enterprises) remained very large, at 13 percent of GDP, causing total public debt to reach
an estimated 98 percent of GDP by December 2013. The budget imbalance reflects the
combination of weaker revenue performance and higher capital expenditure.
Staff projects Cabo Verde’s real GDP growth to pick up to 3 percent in 2014. Improving
economic conditions in the euro area bode well for tourism, remittances, and FDI. Domestically,
consumer and investor confidence is expected to begin recovering, boosted by a more
accommodative monetary policy stance. Inflation is expected to increase as activity picks up, but
remain below 3 percent. The current account deficit should widen in 2014 as the demand for
imports recovers, and is likely to remain high for a few more years, as the large-scale public
investment program is gradually phased out. The principal near-term risks relate to a further
delay in the European recovery, and to a resurfacing of financial stress in the euro area. Domestic
risks are primarily fiscal in nature, given high public debt, though these risks are mitigated by the
high concessionality and long maturity of this debt. Over the longer term, staff project growth of
about 4 percent. The main risk to this outlook relates to Cabo Verde’s ability to implement the
structural reforms needed to boost competitiveness and potential growth.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended Cabo Verde’s economic and social progress in the past decade,
as well as the authorities’ skillful macroeconomic management amid a difficult external
environment, which has helped strengthen foreign reserves and safeguard the exchange rate peg.
At the same time, Directors noted that Cabo Verde is vulnerable to external shocks, and that its
public debt, while mainly on concessional terms, is elevated. They encouraged fiscal
consolidation to rebuild buffers, and structural reforms to bolster productivity and long-term
growth and enhance resilience.
Directors welcomed the fiscal consolidation achieved in 2013 and the authorities’ plans to
restrain spending in 2014 and beyond. At the same time, most Directors saw merit in faster
deficit reduction, balanced with the need to protect growth, to help bring public debt on a
downward path. Directors recommended safeguarding priority social spending and prioritizing
strategic public investment projects while focusing on enhancing their efficiency.
They welcomed efforts to bolster domestic revenue mobilization, and noted the role of Fund
technical assistance in supporting the reform efforts. Directors also commended recent actions to
strengthen the governance and financial performance of state-owned enterprises, and encouraged
continued efforts to improve their efficiency.
Directors agreed that the recent loosening of monetary policy is appropriate, given the slowdown
in private sector credit growth and absence of pressures on international reserves or prices.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive
Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can
be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

However, the weak monetary transmission mechanism undermines the effectiveness of monetary
policy, and Directors called on the authorities to strengthen their liquidity management capacity,
improve interbank market efficiency, and continue developing the government securities market.
It will also be important to maintain a sufficient level of international reserve buffers.
Directors supported the efforts to safeguard financial stability and address non-performing loans,
including more intense bank supervision and new laws that strengthen the supervisory and
regulatory framework. They encouraged the authorities to implement the remaining
recommendations of the 2009 Financial Sector Assessment Program.
Directors noted staff’s assessment that the escudo remains broadly aligned with fundamentals.
In order to enhance the economy’s resilience to external shocks and diversify its sources of
growth, they called for further progress on reforms to bolster competitiveness, create jobs, and
deliver inclusive growth. Improving the business climate and increasing labor market efficiency
and reducing skill mismatches will be particularly important. Directors also encouraged the
authorities to prioritize the goals of the medium-term development plan with the highest
potential economic and social returns.

CABO VERDE

Statement by Mr. Nogueira Batista, Executive Director for Cabo Verde;
Mr. Oliveira Lima, Alternate Executive Director; and Mr. Felipe Santarosa,
Government-Provided Advisor
May 28, 2014
1.
The Cabo Verdean authorities are thankful to staff for their constructive cooperation and
dialogue during the Article IV mission. The process has provided an opportunity for an exchange of
views on a broad range of topics that will contribute to a refinement of the authorities’
macroeconomic objectives in the current transition of Cabo Verde from low to middle-income
status.
2.
Cabo Verde is pursuing a pathway of reforms that, together with the successful conclusion of
the public investment program (PIP), are expected to accelerate growth by increasing productivity
and competitiveness, as well as to foster economic diversification and develop human capital.
The authorities also attribute a high priority to enhancing financial supervision, improving debt
management and strengthening tax administration, areas in which Fund’s technical assistance (TA)
has been instrumental.
Economic developments and outlook
3.
Exposed to a difficult external environment, the Cabo Verdean economy decelerated in the
last two years. The country has been particularly affected by a decline in remittances and foreign
direct investment (FDI) originating from Europe. In 2013, according to staff, GDP is estimated to have
grown by 0.5 percent. If confirmed, this growth rate would be the lowest since 1990. Against this
background, support to domestic demand by the PIP seems to have been of crucial importance.
An outright recession could have been the outcome in 2013 had the government followed staff’s
advice in the last Article IV consultation and pursued fiscal consolidation at a faster pace.
4.
The continued decline in the current account deficit (from 16.3 percent of GDP in 2011 to an
estimated 4.5 percent of GDP last year) has been linked most of all to the good performance of the
services sector, especially tourism, and to the reduction of imports in the context of a carefullymanaged re-phasing of the PIP. Thanks to infrastructure investments and consistent policies for the
sector, tourism has continued to expand in 2013, albeit at a slower pace, and remained a key driver
for growth and exports. The overall balance of payments moved into surplus in 2012 and 2013 and is
expected by staff to remain in positive territory until 2017. As a result, at end-2013, gross
international reserves held by the central bank (Banco de Cabo Verde – BCV) reached the equivalent
of 4.4 months of prospective imports, the midpoint of the Fund’s estimated optimal range for
Cabo Verde. We note that, in the last Article IV report, staff projected reserve coverage for 2013 at
3.3 months of prospective imports, below the floor of the optimal range.
5.
For 2014 and beyond, GDP growth is expected to accelerate as remittances and FDI
gradually recover and the impact of the PIP on productivity and competitiveness starts to be more
clearly felt. Cabo Verde is an archipelago with its economic activity concentrated in three of the nine

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 75

CABO VERDE

inhabited islands: Santiago, the administrative center, and Sal and Boa Vista, the main tourist
destinations. One of the main objectives of the PIP is to overcome infrastructural bottlenecks and
enhance integration between the islands. As the infrastructural transformation takes place, synergies
are being created between the most dynamic sectors and the rest of the economy, allowing each
island to fully develop its potential, according to its comparative advantages.
Fiscal policy
6.
Cabo Verde has a long record of sound macroeconomic management, and the authorities
are aware of the need to pursue fiscal consolidation. As highlighted in our last Buff statement, the
fiscal deficit has been closely associated with the PIP and the country is a good example of why it
may be relevant to separate the capital from the current budget. The ordinary or current budget
balance — proxied by the overall balance excluding public investment — was in surplus last year to
the amount of 1.3 percent of GDP, as can be seen from Table 3b of the staff report. Public
investment (net acquisition of non-financial assets) corresponded to 9.1 percent of GDP while the
central government’s overall deficit was 7.8 percent of GDP. Current expenditures (including wages,
goods and services, subsidies, transfers, social benefits and interest) have decreased as a share of
GDP, from 28.3 percent in 2000 to 22.4 percent in 2012 and 2013. We are surprised to see that staff
once again fails to make this fundamental distinction, thus providing a misleading presentation of
Cabo Verde’s public finances.
7.
Even when including public investment, a trend towards medium-term fiscal consolidation
can be observed since the PIP peaked in 2012. The overall deficit of the central government dropped
from 9.9 percent of GDP that year to 7.8 percent in 2013. It is expected to fall to 7.4 percent in 2014
and to gradually decline to 4.6 percent in 2017. Moreover, the pace of fiscal consolidation is likely to
be more pronounced in the years to come than portrayed under staff’s baseline projections. Staff’s
forecasts are based on expenditure plans contained in the original 2014 budget and in the current
Medium-Term Fiscal Framework (MTFF). However, given Cabo Verde’s budgetary rules, actual fiscal
performance is often less expansionary than originally envisaged.1 This has been the case in recent
years, and the authorities are currently reviewing this year’s budget execution in order to reduce
expenses according to the weaker revenue performance observed in the first quarter. Expenditures
projected in the MTFF for years 2015–17 are also being reduced accordingly.
8.
Raising fiscal revenues is another important component of the middle-term consolidation
strategy. In 2013, measures continued to be taken by the Ministry of Finance and Planning (MFP),
with the help of Fund TA, to broaden the tax base, enhance tax collection, and strengthen the
institutional and administrative capacities of the General Directorate for Contributions and Taxes
(Direção Geral de Contribuições e Impostos – DGCI). The authorities believe that the full impact of
these measures will materialize in the course of the current year. The same can be said of the
harmonization of the value-added tax (VAT) rates, approved in 2012. In this case, a loophole in the

original law was seized by the biggest tourism operators allowing them to pay old rates on tourist
packages during 2013, provided that contracts had been signed in 2012.2
9.
The performance of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) is improving, as noted by staff. Of the six
largest SOEs, only two remain under distress — the energy company Electra and the airline company
TACV (Transportes Aéreos de Cabo Verde) — but reforms on both companies are starting to show
positive results. Preliminary data for 2013 indicate that Electra’s operational losses decreased by half
when compared to 2012. Insofar as TACV is concerned, with the sale of its baggage handling branch,
streamlining of routes and fleet, as well as ongoing managerial improvements, losses have been
similarly contained and the company is expected to break even in 2015.
Debt sustainability
10.
While maintaining Cabo Verde’s commitment to sound public finances, the authorities
intend to finalize in the next few years their strategy of harnessing the concessional financing still
available to the country for ramping up public investment in infrastructure and social projects.
This has resulted in a rapid increase in public external debt, but under very favorable conditions.3
Interest rates are very low (averaging 1.1 percent), mostly fixed (over 92 percent of the total), and the
amortization and grace periods are very long. As can be seen in Text Table 2 of the Debt
Sustainability Analysis (DSA), multilateral debt, which represents over 50 percent of total external
debt, has an average grace period of 9 years and an average amortization period of 34 years. As a
result, external public debt does not breach any indicative threshold under the DSA baseline.
11.
Financing infrastructure projects through concessional rather than non-concessional
resources has entirely different implications. Staff continues to ignore or downplay this elementary
point, and focuses excessively on the debt to GDP ratio. Had Cabo Verde not stepped up its
investment during the current window of opportunity after graduation to middle-income status, it
would have been required to pay much more to finance the same infrastructure. The completion of
the PIP will lay the ground for higher future growth and enhance the country’s capacity to pay its
debt.
12.
Staff continues to consider Cabo Verde’s public and publicly guaranteed debt to be
sustainable but seems unwilling to say so. The important conclusion that Cabo Verde’s debt is
sustainable is only stated in the DSA, and not in the main report, let alone in the staff appraisal.
The report concentrates on emphasizing debt-related risks to such an extent that a different
impression is conveyed to the reader. While references to high or very high overall debt levels
abound (for example, three times in the seven paragraphs of the staff appraisal), there are very few
reminders of the overwhelmingly concessional nature of Cabo Verde’s debt.

This was possible because the VAT law used the date contracts were signed as the basis for determining the rate to
be applied. Taking advantage of that, tourism operators anticipated to 2012 the signature of contracts for a sizeable
number of tourist packages sold for 2013.

External public debt accounts for 76 percent of Cabo Verde’s total public debt.

Monetary policy and financial sector
13.
Monetary policy in 2013 was successful in keeping inflation low and supporting the
exchange rate peg with the euro. With the increase in international reserves to a comfortable level
and inflation under control, the BCV was able to ease monetary policy to support the economic
recovery, in line with staff’s advice. It cut the policy rate by 150 basis points — to 4.25 percent — last
March, and reduced the rates of rediscount and of the lending facility by the same amount, to 8.25
and 7.25 percent, respectively.
14.
Staff had also recommended the BCV to lower the 18 percent minimum reserve requirement
(MRR), stating that it is high compared to peers and that a decrease would free up liquidity and
support credit creation. The BCV, however, considers the current level of the MRR as adequate, given
its dual role as a monetary and prudential tool, and also argued that reserve requirements should
not be changed frequently. Staff’s arguments for lowering the MRR are indeed unconvincing.
It is doubtful that a central bank would make a decision on reserve requirements based on a simple
comparison with its peers. Moreover, with already high excess liquidity, freeing up more bank
reserves would hardly have any effect on credit, and would make liquidity management an even
greater challenge.
15.
BCV’s measures to address non-performing loans (NPLs) in the banking system, on the other
hand, could bring about an increase in credit to the private sector. As indicated in Box 2 of the staff
report, among other initiatives, the BCV conducted a detailed review of banks’ practices for NPL
provisioning and disclosure, and requested banks to follow strictly International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS) definitions. The level of NPLs has started to fall, but, at 16 percent, is still high.
16.
Cabo Verde’s banking sector remains well capitalized and liquid. Foreign banks do not
depend on parent institutions as they are fully funded by domestic deposits. The BCV is committed
to completing the implementation of the 2009 FSAP recommendations. Future priorities of the BCV
include refining its operational framework so as to raise the efficiency of the transmission
mechanism and promote the development of the interbank market.
