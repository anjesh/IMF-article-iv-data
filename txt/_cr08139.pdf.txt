REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA
Staff Report for 2007 Article IV Consultation and the Third Review under the ThreeYear Arrangement Under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility
Prepared by the European Department
(In consultation with other departments)
Approved by Juha Kähkönen and Anthony R. Boote
February 20, 2008
Executive Summary
Much is going well. The authorities have established a good track record of economic
stability, despite shocks. Growth is picking up, investment is replacing remittances as the
main driver of growth, export performance is improving, and poverty has fallen.
Improved growth prospects have brought new challenges. Capital inflows have been
accompanied by strong appreciation pressures, and a widening trade deficit. Moldova has few
policy levers to cope with these pressures, with fiscal policy constrained by development
needs and monetary policy limited by weak transmission mechanisms.
The policy discussions focused on:
•

The need to consolidate disinflation in the face of growing external pressures.
There was consensus on the need to entrench price stability as the primary objective
of the National Bank of Moldova, allow greater exchange rate flexibility, and further
tighten monetary policy if necessary to achieve the objective of single digit inflation.

•

The appropriate balance of fiscal policy between supporting disinflation and
development. There was agreement that improved fiscal prospects provided an
opportunity to boost reforms to create additional space for pro-growth and pro-poor
spending, and to modernize the public administration to better manage resources.

•

The need to bolster the transition process. The FSAP update points to the need to
deepen financial reforms. Structural measures underway target the business climate,
advancing the privatization process, especially of large state enterprises, and
streamlining of the regulatory environment.

Performance under the Third Review has been satisfactory, despite slippages.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Much is going well, but Moldova is increasingly facing many of the strains
experienced by other countries undergoing transition. Since the 2006 Article IV
consultation, the authorities have established a good track record of macroeconomic stability,
despite successive shocks, and the Russian ban on wine imports. Investment is picking up,
and is beginning to replace remittances as the main driver of growth. Improved growth
prospects have also brought new challenges, with strong appreciation pressures from foreign
exchange inflows complicating the disinflation objective. Structural reforms aimed at
advancing the transition process and improving the competitiveness of the economy have
become correspondingly more urgent.
2.
Political pressures are growing with the upcoming national elections in 2009. The
ruling communist party of President Voronin, reelected in 2005 on a pro-Europe, pro-reform
platform, lost support in the capital city of Chişinău in the June 2007 local elections. Politics
have yet to noticeably influence macroeconomic policy, however, apart from disputes at the
municipal level, particularly on heating tariffs.
3.
The external environment has improved. An advantageous autonomous trade
preferences (ATP) agreement with the EU is expected to come into force in March 2008, and
wine exports to Russia are resuming. The successor to the EU-Moldova Action Plan is
expected to be negotiated in mid-2008.
4.
The authorities remain committed to the PRGF-supported program. European
aspirations and prospects of growing financial assistance from the EU and international
donors continue to drive reform. Program implementation under the Third Review has been
satisfactory, despite some slippages.
Box 1. Implementation of Past Fund Policy Recommendations 1/
The authorities’ responsiveness to Fund advice in earlier Article IV consultations has been
good, as reflected in the completion of two reviews under the program. Macro policies have
been prudent, though monetary policy has been less aggressive than Fund recommendations.
Implementation of structural reforms has also been successful with only minor slippages. As
a result, the authorities have managed to maintain macroeconomic stability, even in the face
of a series of significant shocks.

II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
5.
The economy is doing well, but has been set back by consecutive shocks. Moldova
was hit hard by the regional financial crisis in 1998, with the poverty rate doubling to

7
70 percent in 1999, and substantial outward migration. The subsequent recovery was setback
by Russia’s ban on imports of Moldovan wine in March 2006, a doubling of natural gas
prices by Russia’s Gazprom in 2006, and a drought in 2007, which led to a sharp drop in
agricultural output.
•

Growth has been resilient. Strong non-agricultural output maintained overall growth
at a projected 5 percent in 2007, supported by robust exports and higher investment.

•

Disinflation has been set back by the drought. Good progress by the National Bank
of Moldova (NBM) in reducing inflation since 2006 was reversed by a spike in food
prices. After having already met the end-year target of 10 percent by June, headline
inflation ended the year at 13 percent.1

The pass-through from higher prices for imported natural gas has been small, since 90 percent of natural gas is
consumed by households and its CPI share is only 2 percent.

•

The current account deficit narrowed. The current account deficit improved to
10 percent of GDP in 2007 from 12 percent in 2006. A deterioration in the
merchandise trade balance due to strong import growth has been offset by stronger
net income flows and transfers. A resumption of wine exports to Russia in October
was a major positive development, although volumes are likely to recover only
slowly.

6.
The pattern of growth is also changing, with developments in Moldova
increasingly mirroring those in other transition economies:
•

Growth is increasingly been driven by investment. There are signs that the earlier
model of consumption-driven growth financed by remittances is shifting. While large
inflows of remittances continue, information from the banks and investment data
suggest that they are increasingly flowing into investment rather than consumption
(Box 2). FDI has also picked up and is estimated to have reached 12 percent of GDP
in 2007, up from 7 percent in 2006.

Box 2. Remittances and Investment in Moldova 1/
A large proportion of remittances should probably be reclassified as investment in Moldova.
Remittances are defined as personal transfers by non-resident workers (those abroad for more than
a year), often involve related persons, and appear in the current account. Transfers by non-residents
to buy goods or services, however, should be classified under the financial account—what the
money is intended for matters.
The authorities have initiated the process of reclassifying remittances. Recent analysis of
disaggregated data by the NBM revealed some very large transactions, accounting for a substantial
proportion of total money transfers. It is likely that these were intended as payments for goods or
services, but were channeled as personal transfers due to lower transaction and administrative
costs. This revision might ensure a better consistency with survey data on remittances. A recent
2006 household survey estimates that overall remittances (including compensation of employees)
were less than half of those recorded in the BoP, implying that other transfers may be intended for
investment. The table shows 2007 BoP numbers, plus what is implied if some 50 percent of
remittances were to be reclassified.

compensation of employees (wages paid to Moldovans living abroad for less than one year).

•

The structure of the economy is also changing. Construction and trade are growing
rapidly, while agricultural employment has declined. There has been a shift of
employment within the industrial sector away from winemaking into manufacturing,
particularly to textiles, where Moldova’s low labor costs continue to provide a
comparative advantage. This has led to an increase in private sector employment and
a recent slowdown in emigration.

•

Poverty has fallen. Migration has ameliorated poverty as remittances have been
channeled to the poor. Rural wages have also increased due to tighter labor markets.
Overall poverty has fallen to 30 percent in 2007 with notable improvements in access
to water supplies and reducing infant mortality. New estimates indicate that extreme
poverty is lower than previously thought (at less than 5 percent, compared with an
earlier estimate of 16 percent in 2005). The recent drought may have led to some
reversal of some of these gains, despite donor and government efforts to address the
social consequences.

7.

Strong growth performance has presented new challenges:

•

A surge in capital inflows, driven by FDI. Net capital inflows topped 20 percent of
GDP in 2007, up from 8 percent in 2006, and would be higher if remittances were to
be reclassified.

•

Strong appreciation pressures. The strengthening of the real effective exchange rate
has raised concerns about competitiveness, while large sterilization costs have
weakened the financial position of the central bank.

•

A weakening of the trade balance. While export growth has been robust, imports
have grown faster than expected, fuelled by remittances and stronger FDI. The
deterioration in the underlying current account position has been masked by
remittances.

8.
While the trends are similar to those in other transition countries, Moldova has
fewer effective policy levers to address these pressures. Fiscal policy is constrained by
Moldova’s low-income and high development needs, while the effectiveness of monetary
policy is limited due to weak transmission mechanisms.

The policy response has been mixed:

•

Fiscal policy has been restrained. Fiscal performance remained strong in 2007, with
the end-year deficit of

commitments.

•

Monetary policy has been playing catch-up. Despite the tightening in early 2007,
strong inflows of foreign exchange led to a surge in reserve money, and the end-year
ceiling was breached (Figure 1). Faced with mounting inflationary pressures due to

12
second-round effects of the drought, the NBM raised reserve requirements from 10 to
15 percent at end-September, accompanied by an increase in the sterilization rate of
2.5 percentage points to 16 percent. The NBM accelerated the build-up of reserves,
which by end-2007 reached US$1.3 billion, well in excess of US$1 billion projected
at the Second Review, limiting the strong appreciation of the leu (Figure 2).
10.
The structural reform agenda also remains long, despite recent efforts. Moldova
continues to perform poorly under EBRD transition and World Bank “Doing Business”

III. PERFORMANCE UNDER THE THIRD REVIEW
11.
Performance has been satisfactory, with some slippages. All end-September
quantitative PCs were observed. A quantitative benchmark on non-accumulation of domestic
expenditure arrears was missed as Chişinău failed to fully pay the heating subsidies it
decided to grant to households. The indicative target on reserve money has also been missed
as the National Bank of Moldova (NBM) has pursued the multiple objectives of inflation,
low interest rates and exchange rate stability in the face of strong foreign exchange inflows.
12.
All structural PCs have been met. There has been good progress in strengthening
the independence of the central bank, improving financial sector supervision, and enhancing
public finance management.

But some structural benchmarks were missed. The end-September structural
benchmark (SB) on the adoption of the methodology for a targeted social assistance system
was implemented with a slight delay. Reform of the heating sector suffered delays. The endSeptember structural benchmark on increasing tariffs for heat and water to 70 percent of cost
recovery was missed. Tariffs for water were increased to full cost recovery in October, but
the increase in tariffs for heat was delayed pending further work on a municipal social
assistance scheme. An SB on transferring the tariff-setting responsibility for heat and water
to ANRE, the independent national regulator, was not implemented owing to uncertainty
whether the transfer would comply with the constitutional division of rights between local
and central governments. As a compensatory measure, heat tariffs paid to utilities were raised
to full cost-recovery of lei 540 in January (prior action).
14.
Previous concerns about the weakening of the AML regime related to the
passage of a capital amnesty law have been addressed through the new AML law and
by fixing loopholes in the capital amnesty law. Revisions to associated laws aimed at
bringing them in conformity with the international standards have been prepared with the
help of the IMF and bilateral partners.
IV. OUTLOOK
15.
The macroeconomic outlook for 2008 and beyond appears favorable. Growth is
projected to pick-up to in 2008 and 2009, reflecting stronger investments and the unraveling
of the shocks, and then slow to around 6 percent in the medium-term. While rising FDI and
domestic investments, and some weakening of private savings, are expected initially to feed
imports, export recovery and strong transfers should help contain the current account deficit
at about 10 percent of GDP. At the same time, large capital inflows are projected to more
than compensate for the current account deficit, boost reserve accumulation and add to
appreciation pressures. With appropriately tight macroeconomic policies, inflation is
projected to gradually decline to mid-single digits by 2010–11, and help maintain Moldova’s
competitive margin.

While the authorities see upside risks to the outlook, the mission emphasized
that the current favorable environment is still fragile, even if Moldova was little
affected by the recent international financial turmoil. Staff stressed that coming late to
transition, Moldova could benefit from the experience of other countries in the region that
have faced growing current account and inflationary pressures. In particular, smooth
convergence will require maintaining a strong fiscal anchor to bring inflation down quickly
and to allow more policy flexibility when Moldova faces inevitably declining private
savings, mounting capital inflows, and appreciation pressures. At about 43 percent of GDP,
the size of the government is excessive for a country at Moldova’s level of development, and
limits growth potential. Gradual retrenchment of the public sector over the medium term will
be essential to provide room for the private sector. At the same time, a look at Moldova’s
neighbors clearly shows the importance of structural reforms and a healthy financial sector,
for boosting longer-term growth prospects.

While the authorities agreed that the current exchange rate is broadly in line
with fundamentals, they expressed concerns about possible loss of export
competitiveness due to continued appreciation. However, a range of indicators shows that
there is scope for further appreciation without undermining competitiveness (Box 3). The
trend appreciation of the real exchange rate in Moldova mirrors the experiences of
neighboring CEE countries during transition in 1990s, reflecting high rates of return and the
beginning of the convergence process.

Box 3. Competitiveness and the Equilibrium Exchange Rate
Estimates of the equilibrium rate vary within a wide range, and have the usual caveats, but seem to suggest
that the exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals. A standard econometric analysis suggests that the
real effective exchange rate moves broadly in line with fundamentals. The CPI-based REER is roughly unchaned
from the 2001 level; the macroeconomic balance approach indicates the exchange rate is overvalued by about
7 ½ percent; while an estimate of the equilibrium rate based on wage costs for transition countries indicates a
modest overvaluation. Data also suffer from problems. The coefficients for the macroeconomic balance approach
are from the advanced-country CGER exercise (Moldova has insufficient data), and transition economies exhibit
very different characteristics. In addition, Moldova recently suffered from a series of external shocks that adversely
affect the medium-term current account, and an exchange rate devaluation to bring it into balance would be
necessarily biased upwards.

Despite appreciation pressures, competitiveness is still high. Unit labor costs remain low and productivity is
growing fast compared with new EU member states. Moldova is one of the few countries in the region that
continues to attract investments in textiles and other low value-added industries. This assessment dovetails with a
recent business survey, where only 5 of 33 companies viewed excessive strengthening of the leu as a major obstacle
to business development. The large appreciation has not hampered robust export growth (30 percent y-o-y to
November, and 43 percent excluding wine).

The improved macroeconomic outlook further decreases the low risk of debt
distress. Since July 1, 2007, Moldova is classified as a low middle-income country and
above the IDA cutoff. This implies a shift in World Bank financing towards a blend of IDA
and IBRD funds―a move included in the July DSA. The debt-sustaining non-interest current
account deficit is estimated at 17.1 percent of GDP, compared with the expected outturn in
2007 of 8.1 percent of GDP. Although the priority remains to attract concessional financing,
the debt ceiling was raised at the time of the Second Review to accommodate loans from the
EBRD and EIB for roads, and for a health project financed by the Council of Europe
Development Bank.2 Given the outlook, absorptive capacity is likely to be more of a
constraint than debt sustainability.
V. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
19.
The Article IV consultation was a timely opportunity to focus on medium-term
policies and the reform agenda. The program is at the half-way point, and it is clear that the
country is facing different problems than at the time of the last Article IV consultation. Key
areas for discussion were:
•

how to strengthen macroeconomic stability and resume disinflation in the face of
strong capital inflows and appreciation pressures;

•

the appropriate fiscal framework given development needs, including the importance
of creating fiscal space through strengthened capital budgeting, and enhancing
public sector efficiency by balancing employment with the need to attract high quality
staff;

•

how to promote financial deepening, drawing on the FSAP update, and boost
structural reforms to strengthen competitiveness; improve the business climate,
accelerate privatization, and

•

the implementation of a targeted social assistance system to alleviate poverty, a core
objective of the three-year PRGF arrangement.
A. Strong Challenges for Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy

20.
There was consensus on the need to make price stability the overarching
objective of monetary policy, despite lingering appreciation concerns. Strong
appreciation pressures and capital inflows have complicated monetary policy, and the NBM
has been faced with hard choices, as it is not possible to juggle inflation, exchange rate and

20
interest rate goals. The FSSA stressed that lack of clarity about the central bank objectives
has caused difficulties in policy implementation. However, staff noted that the NBM had
recently strengthened its de-facto independence, establishing disinflation as its central
objective, with a planned move to an inflation targeting framework over the medium-term.
Further, it was agreed that:
•

Monetary policy should remain tight until disinflation is firmly reestablished.
The mission and the authorities agreed that real interest rates on sterilization
operations need to stay substantially positive until monetary pressures are eased.
Moreover, an early further tightening should be considered if disinflation does not
quickly resume. The 2008 monetary program proposes to lock in the overperformance
in 2007 on NDA and NIR, and tighten reserve money to ensure the objective of
single-digit inflation is achieved.

•

More exchange rate flexibility is needed to shoulder some of the burden of
monetary tightening. While the authorities expressed some concern about the impact
of the strengthening of the real effective exchange rate on competitiveness, staff
argued that the exchange rate has some scope for further appreciation. Moreover,
although the leu has strengthened against the dollar, appreciation of the nominal
effective rate has been less pronounced. The joint understanding was reached that the
NBM will only intervene to smooth excessive exchange currency fluctuations, and
that any required recapitalization of the NBM due to high sterilization costs will be
covered from the budget.3

There was agreement on the need to bolster these short-term policy changes with
structural measures to strengthen the weak monetary transmission mechanism and
build confidence. These focused on measures to reduce excess liquidity and strengthen the
NBM signaling function (Box 4):
21.

In 2007 the NBM suffered large unrealized losses due to appreciation. However, thanks to the strengthened
capital structure of the central bank, no recapitalization will be needed.

•

To ease liquidity pressures, the accounts of the Social Fund, the Health Fund and
local budgets have been moved from commercial banks to the treasury single account
at the NBM at end-2007, while the introduction of zero-balancing accounts is planned
by end-June 2008. At the same time, the planned securitization of the government
debt to NBM in the first quarter of 2008 will provide the central bank with an
additional liquidity management tool.

•

Markets appear uncertain about NBM’s true objectives. To further improve
policy effectiveness, the NBM intends to step up its policy communication strategy,
streamline existing monetary instruments by adopting a base rate as its main policy
rate by end-March 2008, and shifting sterilization operations to shorter maturities
(MEFP ¶10).

•

The National Bank of Moldova and IMF staff organized an international
conference in December on strengthening the monetary transmission process.
The conference drew on the experience of countries in the region.
Box 4. Interest Rate Channel of Monetary Transmission in Moldova 1/

Staff analysis indicates that the interest rate channel of transmission in Moldova is weak compared
with more advanced European economies. The pass-through coefficient from the policy rate to money
market rates is estimated at 0.27, while in more mature markets these are closer to unity. Pass-through
from the money market to retail lending rates is also weak with a coefficient estimate of only 0.14 versus
the average of 0.65 for the sample of selected countries in the region. Moldova appears to be a clear
outlier. Its financial markets are segmented and there is no a well-established benchmark yield curve.

Pass-through from policy rates to market rates

The main impediment to interest rate transmission in Moldova is excess liquidity. Unless the liquidity
overhang is eliminated, transmission is likely to remain weak. Other factors undermining pass-through
appear to be (i) the perceived uncertainty about monetary policy objectives, which undermines credibility
of the NBM and weakens its signaling function; (ii) underdeveloped financial markets with an incomplete
term structure of interest rates; and (iii) the lack of banking competition.

B. Fiscal Policy in the Face of Conflicting Needs
22.
The authorities were concerned with striking a balance between development
spending and disinflation needs. It was agreed that fiscal policy for 2008 would remain
tight, while increasing spending on health and social assistance and protecting key
investment projects, particularly on much-needed roads, where EBRD and EIB are
supporting the government. In the medium-term, while keeping the budget deficit at
0.5 percent of GDP, the authorities plan to provide for greater fiscal space for social and
investment spending through downsizing, reduction in spending inefficiencies, and
strengthened tax administration.

23.
The 2008 budget is prudent. The deficit target of 0.5 percent of GDP is consistent
with the disinflation objective, implying higher negative domestic financing than in 2007.
Negative domestic financing is likely to increase even further given the upside risks to
privatization revenue. Despite the worldwide growth slowdown, overall revenue estimates
are conservative, particularly revenue from VAT on remittance-financed imports, even
though the budget has been squeezed by corporate and personal income tax cuts. The
authorities proposed to spend any revenue overperformance, now estimated by staff at up to
1 percent of GDP, on investment. However, staff underscored that fiscal policy should
remain tight and any spending of the overperformance be conditional on single digit inflation
being firmly re-established. The authorities agreed to discuss any budget rectification in the
framework of the Fourth Review (MEFP ¶6). The previously announced wage increase was
scaled back, with the public sector wage bill projected to decline from 9.5 percent of GDP in
2007 to 9.4 percent in 2008, which is below the program ceiling of 10 percent of GDP, but
still high for the region (Box 5). In support of the NBM’s efforts to bring inflation down to
single digits, the quarterly profile of the fiscal program in 2008 envisages a balanced budget
for the first half of the year.

23

Box 5. Cooperation with World Bank on Public Administration Reform
Staff is working closely with the Bank on public administration reform. The ongoing World Bank Public
Expenditure Review has identified the implementation of a transparent and uniform remuneration scheme and
consolidation of school and health care networks as key reform areas. The number of budget sector workers is high
by international comparison, particularly in the education sector. The public wage bill is also above regional
averages: at a projected 9.9 percent of GDP in 2007, it is 2.4 percentage points higher than in peer countries. The
2008 wage increase, although scaled back, will continue to crowd out essential spending if downsizing is not
considered. Public sector wages lag behind the private sector and a poorly designed pay structure creates
difficulties in attracting and retaining skilled employees. The public sector rationalization plan under the PRGF is
key for strengthening the link between the medium-term expenditure framework and public administration reform.
Civil service reform is already part of the PRGF.

24.
Policy discussions on the medium-term framework focused on the need to create
fiscal space given pressing development needs:
•

Staff welcomed the authorities’ intention to retain a fiscal deficit anchor of
0.5 percent of GDP, as reflected in the medium-term expenditure framework.
While the DSA shows there would be room for modest additional borrowing, the
fiscal anchor would support macroeconomic stability, and offset the projected decline
in private savings, in line with the experience of other transition economies. At the
same time, the authorities plan to create additional fiscal space to maintain social and
investment spending, allowing a reduction in the overall footprint of the state.

•

It was agreed that strong revenue prospects provide a good opportunity for
decisive reform of the public sector. In line with recommendations of the World
Bank’s 2007 Public Expenditure Review, the authorities’ objectives are to reduce the
size of public employment, especially in education, to consolidate school and health
care networks and improve quality of service and education standards, and design a
transparent and uniform remuneration scheme to closely align pay with skills (Box 5).
The government’s medium-term action plan for rationalizing the public sector
employment envisages downsizing of employment by 10,000 by 2010, with an initial
reduction of 3,000 in 2008. As a first step towards development and implementation
of a new wage grid, essential to rationalizing employment and increasing the quality
of public services, by end-September 2008 the government—with the assistance of
the WB and/or other donors—plans to approve a draft law, which will consolidate all
forms of remuneration in base pay for civil servants, with a view to implementing it
in 2009 (MEFP ¶7, ¶8). The rationalization of public sector employment and wage
grid reform is estimated to reduce the wage bill by about 0.2 percent of GDP
annually.

•

The mission welcomed the authorities’ strategy for strengthening tax
administration. The reform effort in this area has been prompted by a tax amnesty

25
implemented in May 2007, against staff advice, which canceled pre-2007 tax arrears
and halted tax audits for the same period. The MEFP outlines the reform plan, which
has been recently revised in accordance with the recommendations of the FAD TA
mission. The key component of the reform is to strengthen tax enforcement and tax
arrears management by upgrading the IT systems, developing prompt measures for
forced arrears collection, and streamlining procedures for writing off uncollectible
arrears. At the same time, all functions for assessing and collecting arrears, which are
now spread among several entities, will be consolidated in the State Tax Inspectorate
(STI), which will also be reorganized along functional lines (MEFP ¶9).
•

Staff stressed that timely implementation of a new targeted social assistance
system will be key to reduce poverty. As noted in FAD’s poverty and social impact
assessment (PSIA) report, the current system of social assistance based on social
categories is poorly targeted.4 The new, means-tested system, whose methodology
was adopted in early October, and which is scheduled to be implemented by end
September 2008 (MEFP ¶27), promises to considerably improve targeting at an
additional cost of about 0.2 percent of GDP in 2008.
C. Strengthening the Financial Sector

25.
Overall, Moldova’s banking sector appears stable and vulnerabilities
manageable. Robust capitalization and liquidity constitute a first-line buffer in case of
possible distress, but may also indicate weaknesses in operating and risk management
capacity. Rapid credit growth, partially funded through a decline in banks’ foreign assets, and
high dollarization also need to be carefully monitored. In addition, high profitability of banks
and high intermediation spreads suggest that competition may be inadequate. Ironically,
underdevelopment and weak integration in international financial markets have helped
Moldovan banks to weather external disturbances exceptionally well. The banking sector has
proved to be remarkably resilient to external shocks, and the recent global liquidity squeeze
had virtually no impact.
26.
At the same time, the FSAP update highlighted the difficulty in introducing
effective market reforms. Despite considerable efforts to strengthen the financial sector
over past years, it continues to lag behind its peers in intermediating savings. Total assets and
private sector credit have doubled since 2001, but at 54 percent and 31 percent of GDP
respectively, the share of the financial sector in the economy is still small compared with
more advanced countries in the region. More recently, a number of strategic foreign banks
have started to show a keen interest in Moldova, but insufficient transparency of bank
ownership continues to hamper development.

27.
Under the program, there was agreement on the importance of strengthening the
supervisory and regulatory framework for the financial system, and promoting the
transparency of bank ownership. To preserve independence and regulatory powers of
financial sector supervisors, all entities regulated and supervised by the NBM and the NCFM
have been excluded from the Law # 235 on Core Principles of Regulating Entrepreneurial
Activities, which streamlines regulations of entrepreneurial activities (PA). Similarly, the
draft licensing law, which was recently submitted to Parliament, will also be amended to that
effect by end-March 2008 (PC). Further, to address the remaining weaknesses in
transparency of bank ownership, the NBM will step up its efforts in identifying beneficial
owners and study best international practices, especially those of EU countries, in applying
‘fit and proper’ test for significant shareholders (MEFP ¶16).
28.
The staff were encouraged by the authorities’ commitment to accelerate the
privatization of the majority state-owned Banca de Economii (BEM) to a strategic
banking investor, long seen as critical for enhancing competition. As mandated under the
program, the authorities held an international tender for selecting a consulting company for
the bank evaluation. However, in consultation with staff, negotiations have subsequently
been revoked because of the winner’s unwarranted demands for exclusive proprietary rights
to share information obtained during the evaluation and to advise on the sale of the bank after
evaluation. Instead, the authorities have decided to skip this stage and will announce a new
tender for a privatization advisor by end-March 2008, and will select a winner by endSeptember with a six-month timeframe for bringing BEM to market (MEFP ¶14). In the
meantime, they will continue to abstain from granting any preferential treatment to the bank.
D. Boosting Structural Reforms
29.
The authorities showed strong commitment to advancing transition by
bolstering reforms designed to improve the investment climate and clarify the role of
the state in the economy. Important initiatives include: the ongoing regulatory reform,
which is intended to streamline the procedures for business licensing and registration in the
non-financial sector, including setting-up a one-stop shop service, and optimizing the
institutional structure and functions of controlling bodies to reduce business harassment;
revision of insolvency legislation and development of bankruptcy procedures in accordance
with best international practices; strengthening competition legislation and the effectiveness
of the National Agency for Protecting Competition; implementation of the Strategy for
Attracting Investments and Promoting Exports; strengthening product quality testing capacity
and further liberalizing foreign trade by removing quantitative restrictions on imports of meat
and dairy; and adoption of the law on public-private partnerships (PPP).
30.
Staff noted that the zero-rated CIT is not likely to bring new FDI without
improvements in the business climate. With declining CIT rates in other countries in the

28
region, the relative importance of the overall institutional quality is likely to increase further
(Box 6).
Box 6. Zero Corporate Income Tax in Moldova and its Implications for Tax Competition1/
Global economic integration has intensified tax competition over mobile capital. This led to significant
declines in corporate income tax (CIT) rates in Western and Eastern Europe during the last decade. Further
cuts in CIT are likely to continue in the near future (in 2008 alone, ten countries in Europe reduced corporate
tax rates). The declining CIT rates raised concerns about tax competition and the resulting “race to the
bottom”, which could undermine public investment and social spending.

The Moldovan zero CIT could encourage further cuts in CIT. Countries in Eastern Europe strategically
respond to changes in CIT rates in the region. Corporate tax in the region are likely to further decline.
Evidence suggests that FDI flows in the region will not be much affected, because taxes seem to have only
secondary importance in attracting FDI. However, revenues are likely to decline. More positively, the shift in
the composition of tax revenue towards consumption and labor taxes may increase economic efficiency, but at
the cost of a decline in equity.

31.
In a welcome initiative, the authorities have decided to revitalize the stalled
privatization process. The authorities recently published privatization list is a strong
statement that they are committed to private sector development and reducing the role of the
state. However, they were concerned that spending of privatization proceeds was constrained
by the fiscal deficit limits under the program. In response, staff reiterated the importance of
reducing inflation to single digits for macroeconomic stability and noted that quick progress
on disinflation would already have provided more room for spending by the time
privatization revenues materialized. At the same time, staff concurred that transparent

29
privatization efforts that target strategic investors could become a catalyst for growth and
provide a powerful signal of business-friendly policies.
32.
The mission welcomed the government’s decision to sell remaining large state
enterprises, where private involvement can bring new investment and provide a catalyst
for growth. Specifically, they plan to reopen the privatization of Moldtelecom, the
incumbent telecommunications operator. There is evidence that Moldtelecom’s privileged
position distorts the telecommunication market. The World Bank has indicated its
willingness to support the government’s efforts in this area, suggesting that consideration of
privatization should be situated within a wider reform process that includes measures to
bolster competition and liberalize the market to ensure distortions are removed. The
authorities agreed to a structural benchmark on selecting an advisor to look at the modalities
for possible privatization through an open tender by end-September 2008 (MEFP ¶19).
33.
The implementation of utility tariff reform became controversial for heating,
threatening the financial viability of the utility, Termocom. In line with past program
conditionality, the regulator, ANRE, now calculates the cost-recovery tariff using appropriate
inputs and normal rate-of-return methodology. However, it is the municipality that sets the
actual tariffs paid to the utilities. In January 2007, the municipality of Chişinău set heat
tariffs at cost recovery, but subsidized households. The municipality subsequently disputed
the inputs to the methodology, arguing that the cost recovery tariff was lower (implying
lower subsidies needed for households). In December 2007 the municipality canceled its
earlier decision to raise tariffs and subsidize households, resulting in a build-up of arrears to
Termocom. Heat tariffs have been restored to their previous cost-recovery level of lei 540 in
January 2008 following a court decision. To avoid future disruptions in the heating sector,
the authorities request a continuous structural benchmark that heat tariffs received by utilities
be set at cost-recovery following the ANRE methodology, and that in cases of disputes, a
lower tariff than provided by ANRE would imply new domestic expenditure arrears under
the program (MEFP ¶27). To ease the burden on the poor, an interim municipal assistance
scheme will be put in place until the introduction of a new targeted social assistance system
in September 2008.
34.
The authorities at times have shown a tendency to intervene in the trade regime
through administrative measures, though the regime remains generally open. Moldova
is a WTO member and benefits from both a free trade agreement with CIS countries and,
from March 2008, an ATP with the EU. With world grain prices rising and volatile, several
proposals to ban or limit wheat exports have been floated. In addition, the cumbersome new
system for approving meat and dairy imports implemented in early 2007 is a worrying signal
to potential foreign investors.5 The authorities agreed to a structural benchmark to remove the
5

Companies face weekly quantitative restrictions on imports, and have to reapply for permission. This has led
to shell companies being set up, and approvals are regarded as politically influenced and opaque.

30
existing restrictions on meat and dairy, and to refrain from imposing any new restrictions in
the future.
35.
With the program at a halfway stage, discussions focused on key reforms for the
remainder of the PRGF arrangement. It was agreed that high priority should be given to
consolidation of the independence of the financial regulators with appropriate amendments to
the ‘Guillotine law’ (PA) and licensing law (PC). Other core conditionality focuses on
addressing the deteriorating financial condition of the heating sector, which has also
undermined the fiscal position of the general government, the ongoing privatization of Banca
de Economii to enhance competition in the banking sector and strengthen the monetary
transmission process, and the rationalization of the public sector. On the latter, key measures
include initial reforms of the payroll and the downsizing needed to achieve the overall
spending objectives in the medium-term framework, as well as the privatization of the
remaining two large state enterprises (BEM and Moldtelecom) which tie up substantial state
resources and hamper competition in key strategic sectors.
VI. PROGRAM ISSUES
36.
The authorities request to drop two structural benchmarks under the program.
Given the strengthened independence of ANRE, which sets natural gas and electricity tariffs
according to normal rate-of-return methodology, and the demonstrated effectiveness of the
system for these items, it is proposed to drop a continuous SB that these tariffs remain at
cost-recovery levels.6 On the transfer of tariff-setting responsibility for heat to ANRE, the
missed end-September SB, the authorities indicated that it does not comply with the
constitutional division of rights between local and central governments. The staff agreed to
propose dropping this condition from the program, but pointed out that unless the
effectiveness of the current system in setting tariffs for heat and water at cost-recovery is
demonstrated, the Fourth Review would return to this issue. The new structural conditionality
for the review is summarized in the text table.
37.
The authorities have prepared the National Development Strategy (NDS), which
will replace the EGPRSP. The medium-term objectives of the NDS are: (1) strengthening
democracy based on the rule of law and respect for human rights; (2) settling the
Transnistrian conflict and reintegration; (3) enhancing competitiveness and the business
environment; (4) enhancing employment and promoting social inclusion; and (5) developing
regions. Staff discussed measures under the PRGF arrangement to support competitiveness
and the business environment as well as the new social assistance system. The Bank has
greater expertise in labor market and rural development issues. The JSAN, prepared jointly
staffs of the IMF and the WB, summarizes the assessment.

The agreement with Gazprom calls for a gradual increase in gas import prices to European levels by 2011.

VII. STAFF APPRAISAL
38.

Much has been achieved despite the shocks:

•

Growth remains robust. Investment is picking up, and is beginning to replace
remittances as the main driver of the economy. Poverty has fallen, and Moldova has
been reclassified as a middle-income country.

•

The PRGF arrangement remains on track. Program implementation under the
Third Review has been satisfactory, and the authorities’ policies for 2008 are
appropriately ambitious, with a welcome pick-up in the pace of structural reforms,
despite the upcoming elections.

39.

But much remains to be done, and the challenges are considerable:

•

Moldova’s progress has not come without tests. Transition has brought with it
strong capital inflows, appreciation pressures, and a widening trade deficit.

•

The authorities have few policy levers to address these pressures. The impact of
monetary policy is compromised by a weak transmission mechanism, and fiscal
policy is burdened with large development needs.

40.
Monetary policy needs to play a major and strengthened role. Inflation at 13
percent at end 2007 is higher than we had hoped, even accounting for the drought. Continued
strong foreign exchange inflows and reserve money growth suggest the upside risks to
inflation remain. The recent tightening by the National Bank and its commitment to establish
price stability as its sole objective is therefore welcome. However, it needs to be prepared to
allow greater exchange rate flexibility, and to tighten its policy rate further if disinflation
does not resume.
41.
Overall, vulnerabilities of the financial sector appear manageable, but reforms
to deepen financial markets will be important to help strengthen the effectiveness of
monetary policy. In line with the FSAP update, these should focus on strengthening the
supervisory and regulatory framework, restructuring of the central bank with a view to
eventual introduction of inflation targeting, and promoting transparency of bank ownership.
The privatization of the majority state-owned bank should also help inject greater
competition into the system. The authorities should ensure that implementation of the new
AML/CFT law is effective.
42.
Fiscal policy has to play its part. The 2008 budget does a reasonable job in
balancing development needs with disinflation. Modest fiscal deficits are an appropriate
compromise. Nevertheless, the budget should remain tight until single digit inflation is firmly
established, with the scope for higher development expenditure assessed at the time of the

33
next review. Revenue performance will be helped by robust VAT on imports, which is likely
to partly offset the impact of the earlier tax cuts. Social spending has been raised, investment
remains high, and the effects of the recent wage increases limited.
43.
Strong revenue prospects provide an opportunity for decisive public sector
reform. The authorities’ plans for reducing the size of the public sector, introducing a
transparent and attractive remuneration system, and consolidating education and health care
networks, are all important steps to ensure the efficient management of scarce public
resources and establish a modern public administration.
44.
The authorities’ commitment to strengthen tax administration is welcome. The
reforms, which draw on Fund technical assistance, should help avoid reemergence of the
problems with tax arrears that we saw at the time of the last review.
45.
The structural reform agenda remains long. Moldova continues to score
unfavorably on most transition indicators. The second ‘Guillotine law’ is an important
initiative to improve business licensing, but just as important will be planned measures to
curtail discretionary powers of officials and to revitalize the privatization process to promote
private sector-based growth.
46.
The instinct for state intervention is nevertheless strong. This is seen most clearly
in the trade sector where numerous initiatives have obstructed the normal workings of the
trade system. The authorities have undertaken to remove recently imposed import
restrictions, but attitudes are likely to take longer to change.
47.
Modernization of the energy sector should remain high on the authorities’
agenda. The establishment of cost recovery tariffs in the heating sector will help alleviate the
weak financial condition of the energy sector, and staff have encouraged the authorities to
work with the Bank on broader energy reforms.
48.
The staff assessment of the exchange rate raises no major concerns regarding
external sustainability, with room to accommodate appreciation pressures. The current
exchange rate appears to be broadly in line with fundamentals. With considerably lower labor
costs and higher productivity growth compared to the region, there is scope for further
appreciation without undermining competitiveness.
49.
The staff recommends completion of the third review. Performance under the
program has been satisfactory, and policies for 2008 remain appropriately ambitious.
50.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Moldova remain on a 24month cycle in line with the provisions of the decision on consultation cycles in program
countries.

The draft law was passed in first reading on Dec 28, 2006. Because of the
controversy in parliament over the negative list of companies to be
privatized, the law passed in second reading is May 2007 as a prior action
for the second review.

Deloitte was announced the winner.

Functional reviews were completed. In Nov. 06 DAI Europe company
presented the final report on functional analysis plus five sectorial reports,
based on which a group of experts from the PAR Unit is elaborating
recommendations to be submitted for the government.

STI has taken on this responsibility.

Draft law has been prepared, but the authorities (in consultation with staff)
decided to postpone submission to parliament to take advantage of OECDSIGMA TA in Q1 2007. The consultation process has taken longer than
expected, partly due to the local elections in June, but parliamental
approval is expected in late 2007.

The plan for strengthening the Social Fund’s financial situation was
approved on Dec 27, 2006.

The draft law on management and divestiture of state assets was submitted
to parliament with delay to take account of comments from development
partners. The draft law on public debt was approved by government and
approved by parliament in first reading on Nov. 23, 2006.

A draft strategy has been drafted, but the authorities are looking for
international technical assistance to complete the draft.

The requirement that grain exports must be transacted on Moldovan
Commodity Exchange has been abolished by the govenment Decision #946
of Aug. 18, 2006.

The plan was prepared and signed jointly by the MoF and the NBM on
Sep. 29.

Draft Methodology and Guide to Regulatory Impact Assessment have been
prepared, approved by the State Commission for Entrepreneurship Activity
Regulation on Sep 15, and then by the government on Sep 27.

By decision #206 of February 14, 2006 "On Natural Gas", ANRE - the
national energy regulator - raised the natural gas tariffs for consumers to

January 1. Households consume 71 percent of the district heat, at the old

At the time of the second review, the measure was divided into two parts

The NBM and the MoF adopted a plan, which envisages gradual
securitization of the remaining stock of the NBM cliams on the government
until end-March 2008, in conformity with #28.

Water tariffs were increased to full cost-recovery with a small delay on
Oct. 11. The increase in heating tariffs was delayd pending furhter work on
a municipal social assistance scheme.

The draft 2008 budget assumes no transfer of NBM net income due to
expeted large unrealized losses from revaluation.

Law #382-XVI on amendments to the NBM Law was approved on Dec 7,
2006.

Because of the delay with the passage of the NCFM law, this measure was
pushed back to August 2007, but was made a structural PC (see # 19).

Draft legislation was submitted to parliament in late March and passed in
first reading in early May. The law passed on June 7, 2007 (see # 16

The agreement between the NBM and the MoF was signed on Dec 12,

By the government decision of September 21, 2007 the remaining balances
on the accounts of Social Fund, Health Fund and territorial budgets have
been transferred to STA in the NBM on December 29, 2007.

Around lei 150 million still remains to be paid.

The methodology was approved by the government on Oct. 3, 2007.

There appears to be legal uncertainty as to whether the transfer would
comply with the constitutional division of rights between central and local
governments. Since Chisinau follows the ANRE methodology and thus
objectives of the condition were met, staff is proposing to drop it from the
program conditionality.

Information on the financial performances of state-owned enterprises and
joint stock companies was included with the draft budget already in 2007.

Given the strengthened independence of the energy regulator, the mission
porposes to drop this measure.

Mr. Dominique Strauss-Kahn
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street NW
Washington, DC 20431 USA

Dear Mr. Strauss-Kahn:
The attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies(MEFP) for 2008
describes policies and measures we intend to implement this year and for which we
request the support of the International Monetary Fund under the three-year arrangement
under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF). These policies are consistent
with our National Development Strategy (NDS) as well as with the action plan agreed
between the European Union and the Republic of Moldova.
Now that the external shocks have receded, the government and the National Bank
believe that all efforts should focus on the core goals of the program, which are to
promote sustainable growth and reduce poverty. To this end, the policies set forth in the
attached memorandum aim at ensuring macroeconomic stability and financial sector
development, and improving the business environment, including through reduction of
the footprint of the state in the economy. In addition, in consultation with the Fund, we
will take additional measures that may become appropriate for reaching these objectives.
We implemented all end-September performance criteria under the program, as well as
prior actions for this review, and hereby request completion of the third review under the
PRGF arrangement.
We will communicate to the IMF the information needed to monitor progress in
implementing the program, and will conduct discussions with the Fund for the fourth
review under the PRGF arrangement before end-May 2008. We anticipate that the fourth
review under the PRGF arrangement will be conducted based on end-March 2008 data
and be completed before end-June 2008. The Fifth Review will be based on endSeptember 2008 data, to be completed by the year-end.

55
We are committed to transparency, and thus we authorize the IMF to disseminate the
MEFP and the associated Technical Memorandum of Understanding, as well as staff
report that will be examined by the IMF Executive Board.
Sincerely yours,

ATTACHMENT II. MEMORANDUM OF ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES
February 19, 2008
A.

Introduction

1. Building on the progress achieved over the past 2 years under the program supported
by the three-year arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF),
this memorandum summarizes our strategic priorities for 2008 and sets forth policies and
reform objectives.
2. Despite severe external shocks suffered by Moldova in 2006, macroeconomic
developments this year have been favorable. The national economy grew by 8 percent in
the first half of 2007, though it slowed thereafter due to a weak harvest caused by the
summer drought. As a result, we expect GDP growth to reach 5 percent for the year, up
from 4 percent in 2006. Export performance has been encouraging and the recovery is
likely to accelerate further as wine exports to Russia resumed from the fourth quarter of
2007. While imports grew even faster, fuelled by rapidly increasing FDI and strong
remittances, the current account deficit has still narrowed due to improvements in net
income and transfers. Successful disinflation in the first six months of 2007 was set back
by the drought. At 13.1 percent CPI inflation remains high for the region. Strong inflows
of foreign exchange and the global weakening of the US dollar led to an appreciation of
the leu, which strengthened by 12 against the dollar and by 2 percent against the Euro
since the beginning of the year.
B.

Performance under the Program

3.
Except for a few instances, the government and NBM have implemented the
measures under the updated Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP)
of June 14, 2007. In particular, by September 30 the following actions have been
completed:
a. On May 4, 2007 the parliament of Moldova approved the Law on Public
Property Management and Divestiture. Furthermore, the government
approved resolutions on (i) privatization of state-owned public land; (ii)
measures to implement the Law on Public Property Management and
Divestiture; and (iii) the structure and regulation of the Public Property
Agency under the Ministry of Economy and Commerce;
b. On June 7, 2007, parliament approved Law #129-XVI, which effective
July 6, 2007, established the National Commission for Financial Markets
(NCFM) to take on the responsibility for supervision of insurance and
capital markets, non-state pension funds, and loan and savings

57
associations. To make the new body operational, parliament appointed the
administrative board and the management of the NCFM, which in turn
approved the organizational structure on August 3, 2007;
c. The concept paper on “Rationalization of the Number of Employees in the
Budgetary Sector for 2008-2010” was approved on September 28, 2007,
imposing a limit on the public sector wage bill of 10 percent of GDP.
Since then the paper has been further revised to include a time-bound plan
to downsize public employment, implementation of a new wage system
for public servants, and an assessment of the fiscal impact;
d. On September 28, 2007, the prime-minister approved an action plan for
improving the tax arrears management. We have further updated the plan
based on recommendations of the FAD TA mission;
e. The draft 2008 Budget Law approved by the government on September
27, 2007 includes an assessment on financial performance in 2006 of
state-owned enterprises and joint stock companies in which the state is the
majority shareholder.
f. The plan for converting government’s debt into state securities was
adopted by the Ministry of Finance on September 10, 2007 and by the
National Bank of Moldova on September 12, 2007.
At the same time, four structural benchmarks were not observed:
•

•

•
•

The end-September structural benchmark on adoption of the targeted
social assistance system was implemented on October 3, 2007. The
government approved the draft Law on Social Assistance, which aims at
ensuring a guaranteed minimum monthly income to vulnerable households
based on proxy means testing;
The passage of the legislation ensuring that ANRE establishes tariffs for
heat and water directly, rather than indirectly through the municipality,
was not implemented because of legal uncertainty about the conformity of
this measure with the constitutional division of responsibilities between
local and central governments;
Tariffs for water were raised to cost-recovery in October, but the heating
tariffs in Chisinau were not increased.
The municipal budget made only partial payment for the difference
between the amount paid by households for heat and the cost recovery
level. At end-September the arrears equaled about lei 50 million, down
from lei 160 in April.

58

Program Objectives

4.
The government’s medium-term objectives are outlined in the newly developed
Strategy for 2008-2011 (NDS), which will replace the Economic Growth and Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (EGPRSP). Unlike earlier practices in developing national
strategies, this document focuses on a well-defined list of strategic priorities, both
economic and political. The draft NDS Strategy includes five fundamental priorities:
•
•
•
•
•

strengthen a modern democratic state, based on the principle of rule of law;
settle the Transnistrian conflict and promote the reintegration of the country;
enhance national economic competitiveness;
develop human resources, raise the employment level, and promote social
inclusion, and;
promote regional development.

In addition to setting out our medium-term priorities, one of the NDS goals is to integrate
in one single strategy the key external commitments of the Republic of Moldova (without
substituting bilateral policy papers) and to establish a single system to monitor the
fulfillment of these commitments.
5.
The main objective for 2008 remains unchanged: facilitating poverty reduction by
ensuring macroeconomic stability and sustainable economic growth. We hope to achieve
this objective by modernizing the public service and reducing state involvement in the
economy, developing the financial sector, creating a favorable investment environment,
encouraging the development of small and medium businesses, rehabilitating
infrastructure, promoting exports, creating new jobs and providing social protection to
vulnerable categories of the population. These objectives – that incorporate the
achievement of the Millennium Development Goals – are reflected in the NDS.
D.

Fiscal Policy

6.
Fiscal policy for 2008 will remain tight, given continuing high inflation and the
need to ensure macroeconomic stability and build confidence in the program. The
government will keep a budget deficit of 0.5 percent of GDP. Any budget rectification
will be discussed in the framework of the fourth review. Our priority is to channel
overperformance to investments, which have a minimal inflationary impact.
7.
While budget wages have been increased by 45 percent in 2006 and 12 percent in
2007, they remain insufficient for attracting and keeping qualified employees, many of
whom have opted for a job in the private sector or abroad. To improve competitiveness of
the public sector, wages will be increased by another 23 percent in 2008, though the total
wage bill will be kept below 10 percent of the GDP, owing to a phasing in of the
increases. However, we realize that raising salaries will not increase public sector
effectiveness unless accompanied by bold reforms. For that purpose, the government

59
plans to start implementation of the medium-term action plan for rationalizing the
structure of employment in the budget sector for 2008-2010. which envisages:
•

downsizing of employment by 10 thousands by 2010, with a initial reduction of
3 thousands in 2008, and

•

the government approval of a draft law, which will consolidate all forms of
remuneration in base pay for civil servants by end-September 2008, with a view
to implementing it in the 2009 budget year.

8.
Part of the savings from the optimization of staffing will be used towards
improving the quality of public service. Moldovan authorities are to develop annual plans
for the implementation of the program with plans for 2008 completed by end-March
2008, which should include, but not be limited to budget sector staff inventory; review of
wage and non-wage payments to staff; and assessment of sector needs for highly
qualified staff. Restructuring in the education sector will focus on rationalization of
educational establishments.
9.
To promote foreign and domestic investments in 2007, we announced a major
reform of the corporate income tax system, as well as a wide-ranging amnesty of tax
arrears and a liberalization of capital legalization regulations. We are aware that these
reforms imply certain risks, in particular with respect to budget revenues. To address
these concerns, we intend to speed up the implementation of Tax Administration
Strengthening Strategy. The plan, which was adopted in September 2007, has now been
updated to reflect recommendations of the FAD TA mission. It aims at strengthening the
tax arrears management system, which will improve accounting of tax arrears to allow
distinction of arrears by vintage, introduce a set of prompt unconditional measures for
forced arrears collection, amend the current legislation to ensure a shorter, more
streamlined procedure for writing-off uncollectible tax arrears, and consolidate all
functions for assessment and collection of arrears in a single agency. The State Tax
Inspectorate (STI) will be reorganized along functional lines, beginning with
headquarters. By March 2008, we will adopt legislation to allow STI to write off
uncollectible tax arrears. At the same time, we will develop a modern accounting and
information technology platform, and ensure adequate resources for these reforms.
E.

Monetary Policy

10.
In 2008 the National Bank of Moldova will continue to pursue its main objective
of price stability. The monetary policy stance will remain tight with the aim to resume
disinflation and achieve single digit levels by the year-end (December-to-December). For
that purpose, real interest rates on sterilization operations will be kept sufficiently
positive in real terms until disinflation is well entrenched. Moreover, we stand ready to
promptly increase reserve requirements and/or interest rates at the first signs of reversal
of trend disinflation. Liquidity pressures are expected to be further eased by the transfer

60
of the remaining deposits of the Social Fund, the Health Fund and territorial budgets from
commercial banks to the Treasury Single Account at the NBM at end-2007, and the
introduction of full zero-balancing by end-June 2008. To further improve effectiveness of
monetary policy, the NBM will streamline its instruments by adopting a base rate as a
main policy rate to remove the ambiguity between the two rates, and shifting sterilization
operations to shorter maturities. At the same time, the planned securitization of the
government debt to NBM in the first quarter of 2008 will provide the central bank an
additional liquidity management tool.
11.
The NBM will maintain a flexible exchange rate regime to ease the burden on
monetary policy tightening. If inflows of foreign exchange and appreciation pressures
persist, the NBM will intervene only to smooth excessive fluctuations of the national
currency, while allowing markets to determine the exchange rate. We expect foreign
exchange reserves to reach USD 1.7 billion, or at least 3 month of imports, by the end of
2008. While continued appreciation of the leu and growing sterilization costs may
weaken the financial position of the NBM, we are committed to the disinflation objective,
which will not be compromised for NBM profitability considerations. Any need to
recapitalize the NBM will be met by the government in accordance with the NBM law.
The NBM will develop an early warning system that it will use to detect potentially
disruptive economic developments, including large capital flows
12.
We are planning to move to a formal inflation targeting (IT) framework at an
appropriate time in the future. Although we are aware that Moldova is not yet ready to
implement IT, we are nevertheless undertaking intermediary steps to improve the current
framework of monetary policy and lay the foundation for a new regime. Starting with the
2008 Budget, the Budget Law will no longer oblige the NBM to roll over state securities,
including those acquired through securitization. Instead, the NBM and the Ministry of
Finance will conclude yearly agreements on the annual redemption of state debt to the
NBM. We will further improve our communication strategy and policy transparency to
raise public awareness of risks to inflation and to strengthen the signaling function of the
NBM. To help us achieve our objectives, we have requested technical assistance––a longterm advisor–– from the Fund in monetary research and capacity building for monetary
policy implementation. As a first step, in line with MCM TA recommendations, the NBM
will restructure its research and monetary policy department, and will hire new qualified
staff.
13.
The NBM will extend its supervision over all parts of the payment system,
including those that are operating outside the central bank
F.

Financial Sector Reforms

14.
In order to strengthen competition in the banking system, we intend to accelerate
privatization of Banca de Economii (BEM) to a strategic banking investor. Our previous
plan to perform an independent valuation of the bank prior to bringing it to market has
stalled due to unwarranted demands by the selected evaluation advisor. Instead, we have

61
now decided to hire directly a privatization advisor. For that purpose, by end-March 2008
we will announce a tender for selecting a privatization advisor and by end-September
2008 will sign a contract with the winner with a 6-month timeframe for bringing BEM to
market. In the meantime, the government and the NBM will continue to abstain from
granting preferential treatment to the bank, including as regards taxation, prudential
regulation or access to resources.
15.
The establishment of the NCFM in June 2007 as a regulatory and supervisory
body for the non-bank financial sector was the first step aiming at strengthening this
segment of the financial market. We will ensure a solution for the stable financing of the
NCFM, and financial sector supervisory/regulatory agencies will be required to conclude
formal agreements of cooperation with each other. The medium-term goal is to promote
development of capital and insurance markets, the market for non-state pension funds,
and the micro-credit institutions by reducing risks and vulnerabilities, increasing
transparency, updating the regulations in conformity with the best international practices,
and encouraging introduction of new financial products. To this end, we intend to request
technical assistance from international financial institutions.
16.
The government and the NBM will continue to strengthen the supervisory and
regulatory framework for the financial system and ensure transparency to promote
stability and steady development. Following the recommendations of the recent FSAP
update, to preserve independence and adequate powers of financial sector regulators, all
entities licensed, regulated and supervised by the NBM and/or the NCFM have been
excluded from the provisions of the law #235 on the Core Principles of Regulating
Entrepreneurial Activity, which was adopted by Parliament at end-2007. Similarly, the
draft licensing law now before Parliament will also exclude the financial sector and
delegate the full licensing authority in this area to the NBM and the NCFM. Further, to
strengthen transparency of bank ownership and control, following FSAP update
recommendations, we will step-up our efforts in identifying beneficial owners of banks
and will study best international practices, especially those of EU countries, in applying
‘fit and proper’ tests for significant shareholders.
17.
The parliament of Moldova has adopted a new Anti-Money Laundering (AML)
and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (CFT) Law (drafted with the assistance of the
IMF and other partners). We will continue revision of associated laws to bring the
AML/CFT framework of Moldova in conformity with the international standard. With
the assistance of the IMF and others, we intend to strengthen the capacity of the Financial
Intelligence Unit, as well as of the NBM in preventing and combating money laundering
and the financing of terrorism, and streamline AML/CFT procedures to reduce the burden
of compliance.
G.
Other Structural Reforms
18.
External shocks faced by the Republic of Moldova during the last two years have
revealed the country’s limitations with regard to competitiveness and resilience towards
potential macroeconomic risks. Government agenda for 2008 will include structural
measures aimed at building the economy’s resilience to external shocks and laying a

62
sustainable foundation for strong inclusive growth. In this context, the central public
administration reform, as well as the reform of the business regulatory framework will
continue, while measures will be taken to encourage private sector investment.
To increase competitiveness, special attention will be paid to improving the quality of
infrastructure. To that effect, we will ensure that public investment in infrastructure is
sustained at a high level.
Privatization, Trade Policy and Investment Promotion
19.
A component of our strategy will be the acceleration of the privatization of public
assets to attract know-how and promote private sector development. A clear statement of
our commitment to private sector development will be the selection of an advisor through
an open tender by end-September 2008 to assess the modalities for the possible
privatization of Moldtelecom. Our objective is to continue the privatization of state assets
through a competitive and transparent process. Any adjustor for the use of possible
excess privatization revenues will be discussed with the IMF during the fourth and
subsequent reviews. In the meantime, in line with the recommendations of the IMF,
OECD guidelines, and international best practice, we will seek technical assistance from
international institutions to strengthen financial discipline of remaining state enterprises,
set up procedures to select management of state enterprises through a competitive
process.
20.
By the end of this year, Moldova will benefit from an autonomous trade
preferences regime with the EU. For businesses to benefit from the new trade regime, the
government will make efforts to improve the quality of management systems in Moldova.
In this context, a number of actions will be undertaken: (i) the National Program for the
Development of Technical Regulations by Converting the Relevant Normative Acts of
the EU will be fully implemented; (ii) the structure of the laboratories for testing and
ensuring the product quality will be assessed and a strategic plan for further strengthening
and development of the laboratories will be developed; (iii) the National Training
Program for Businessmen in Quality Management, Modern Techniques for Ensuring the
Quality of Produced Goods (ISO), and Systems for Ensuring Safety at Enterprises
(HACCP) will be developed and implemented; (iv) guidance manuals for consumers will
be developed to increase public awareness and literacy in quality standards.
21.
The National Competition Protection Agency will adopt a clear definition of state
aid, to avoid confusion of such terms as subsidies, subventions, tax facilities, to set clear
rules for granting state aid in 2008.
22.
To encourage investment inflow into the national economy in 2008, Government
will make efforts to implement the actions set by the 2008 Action Plan for the
Implementation of the Strategy for Attracting Investments and Promoting Export for
2006-2015. Strengthening of small and medium business is one of the key elements that
will contribute to economic growth and poverty reduction in the Republic of Moldova.
To support SME development, the Organization for SME Sector Development was
established, and its capacity will continue to be built next year. During 2008 Government

63
will continue implementation of the actions set in the Strategy for SME Development
Support and will ensure compliance with the provisions of the SME Law.
23.
To diversify ways to attract investments, the Law on Industrial Parks was
approved. Thus, based on the performance indicators for investment attraction to the
North, Center, and South regions we are planning to establish the first pilot industrial
parks in 2008 in several settlements in these regions. These projects will have a minor
impact on the budget, and will be implemented in a way that will eliminate any economic
distortions. Government will be looking for ways to attract private investors in the
process of industrial parks’ management.
24.
The government approved the law on public-private-partnerships (PPP) in
December 2007. Parliament will adopt the law by end-July 2008, and the PPP unit will be
fully operational by the end of 2008. In addition to reporting to parliament any contingent
liabilities that could be introduced through this mechanism, and assessing the potential
fiscal impact that would be included in the budget, we intend to consult with the IMF
before concluding any significant PPP arrangements.
25.
The non-accumulation of external payments arrears, as defined in the TMU, will
constitute a continuous performance criterion, as will our commitment not to impose or
intensify restrictions on current payments, introduce multicurrency practices, including
bilateral payments agreements that are inconsistent with Article VIII, or imposing or
intensifying import restrictions for balance of payments reasons. The government will
remove the recently imposed quantitative import restrictions on meat and dairy products
by June 2008.
Enhancing the Business Environment and Regulatory Reform
26.
With the aim to improve the business climate, the government intends to
streamline the regulatory environment in the non-financial sector by substantially
reducing excessive licensing, permit and authorization requirements; burdensome and
loosely regulated activities of controlling bodies; and proliferation of public services
provided for fees. In particular, the new licensing law that will be effective by March
2008, will establish a more liberal, consolidated and transparent licensing system valid
for all licensing authorities except for the NBM and the NCFM, and set up a free of
charge access for the public (through the internet) to register licenses. At the same time,
Government will take steps to optimize the institutional structure and the functions of the
state control bodies, focusing mostly on supervision of activities in the non-financial
sector without on-site visits, and carrying out inspections only if information is gathered
during supervision that shows that enterprises are violating current legislation. Starting
with 2008, all informative notes accompanying new draft acts will include regulatory
impact analyses. In addition, during 2008 one stop-shop services will be launched for
relevant public services. Insolvency legislation will be reviewed taking into account the
best international bankruptcy practices.

64
27.
Tariffs for natural gas and electricity have stayed at cost-recovery levels, for all
consumer categories. Moreover, as energy prices change, these tariffs will also adjust
accordingly in line with the ANRE methodology. As a prior action, tariffs for heat will be
set at the cost-recovery level according to the ANRE methodology. As originally
planned, the new system of targeted social benefits will be put in place by September 30,
2008. As an interim measure, appropriate social assistance for those that cannot afford
the higher tariffs will be put in place

The general government is defined as comprising the central and local government
budgets. The central government includes also the Social Insurance Fund, the Health
Insurance Fund, special and extrabudgetary funds, and foreign-financed investment projects.
The local government includes also special and extrabudgetary funds. The authorities will
inform the Fund staff of any new special or extrabudgetary funds that may be created during
the program period to carry out operations of a fiscal nature and will ensure that these will be
included in the general government. Excluded are any government-owned entities with a
separate legal status. Net credit of the banking system to general government is defined as
outstanding claims of the banking system on the general government (exclusive of the claims
associated with accrued interest, tax and social contribution payments by commercial banks,
and foreign financed on-lending by banks), including overdrafts, direct credit and holdings
of government securities, less deposits of the general government (excluding accrued interest
on government deposits, and including the accounts for foreign-financed investment
projects).1 The Ministry of Finance will provide data on the holdings of government
securities and foreign-financed investment projects.
12.
The quarterly limits on the overall cash deficit of the general government are
cumulative and will be monitored from the financing side as the sum of net credit of the
banking system to the general government (excluding the change in the stock of government
securities issued to recapitalize the central bank), the general government’s net placement of
securities outside the domestic banking system, other net credit from the domestic nonbanking sector to the general government, the general government’s receipt of disbursements
from external debt2 for direct budgetary support and for specific projects minus amortization
paid, and privatization proceeds stemming from the sale of the general government’s assets,
after deduction of the costs directly associated with the sale of these assets.

For the calculation of the net credit of the banking system to general government the following accounts will
be excluded: 1731, 1732, 1733, 1735, 1761, 1762, 1763, 1801, 1802, 1805, 1807, 2711, 2717, 2721, 2727,

The quarterly limits on the general government wage bill are cumulative and
measured as the sum of total salaries, bonus payments and other types of remuneration,
social security contributions to the National Social Insurance House, and contributions to the
National Health Insurance Company paid to all employees in the general government sector
as defined in paragraph 11, excluding wages paid to employees of the National Social
Insurance House and the National Health Insurance Company. For 2007, the general
government wage bill based on such a definition amounted to 4,970 million lei.3

Government securities in the form of zero-coupon obligations sold at a discount to
face value will be treated as financing items in the fiscal accounts, in the amount actually
received from buyers. At the time of redemption, the sales value will be recorded as
amortization, and the difference between amortization so defined and the face value will be
recorded as domestic interest payments.
15.
External-debt limits apply to the contracting or guaranteeing of (i) short-term nonconcessional external debt (with an original maturity of up to and including one year) and
(ii) non-concessional medium- and long-term debt with original maturities of more than one
year. The limit is zero with the exception of the health project financed by €9 million from
the Council of Europe Development Bank (CEB). In 2007, the ceiling was raised for a road
project to be partly financed by €30 million from the European Investment Bank (EIB) and
by €30 million from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD).
The first phases of the EBRD and EIB road project (in the amount of €12.5 million each)
will not have grant co-financing, but the second phases (in the amount of €17.5 million each)
are expected to include grant co-financing sufficient to bring the overall level of
concessionality on the second phases of the project to at least the target level of 35 percent.
Short-term debt includes all short term obligations, excluding import trade credits. Shortterm debt denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar shall be valued in U.S. dollars

The term debt has the meaning set forth in point No. 9 of the Guidelines on
Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt (Decision No. 12274-(00/85), adopted
August 24, 2000).4 This performance criterion applies not only to debt as defined above, but
also to commitments contracted or guaranteed for which value has not been received.
17.
For purpose of the program, the guarantee of a debt arises from any explicit legal
obligation of the government or the NBM or any other agency acting on behalf of the
government to service such a debt in the event of nonpayment by the recipient.
18.
Concessionality will be calculated using currency-specific discount rates based on
the OECD commercial interest reference rates (CIRRs). The ten-year average of CIRRs will
be used as the discount rate to assess the concessionality of loans of an original maturity of
at least 15 years, and a six-month average of CIRRs will be used to assess the
concessionality of loans with original maturities of less than 15 years. To both the ten-year
and six-month averages, the following margins will be added: 0.75 percent for repayment
periods of less than 15 years; 1 percent for 15–19 years; 1.15 percent for 20–30 years; and
1.25 percent for over 30 years. Under this definition, only loans with a grant element
equivalent to 35 percent or more will be excluded from the borrowing limits. The debt limits
will not apply to loans classified as international reserve liabilities of the NBM.

4

Debt is defined as a current, i.e., not contingent, liability, created under a contractual arrangement through the
provision of value in the form of assets (including currency) or services, and which requires the obligor to make
one or more payments in the form of assets (including currency) or services, at some future point(s) in time;
these payments will discharge the principal and/or interest liabilities incurred under the contract. Arrears,
penalties, and judicially awarded damages arising from the failure to make payment under a contractual
obligation that constitutes debt are debt. Failure to make payment on an obligation that is not considered debt
under this definition (e.g., payment on delivery) will not give rise to debt.

71

19.
For the purposes of the program, external payments arrears will consist of all overdue
debt-service obligations (i.e. payments of principal or interest) arising in respect of any debt
contracted or guaranteed or assumed by the government of the Republic of Moldova, or the
NBM, or any agency acting on behalf of the government of the Republic of Moldova. The
ceiling on new external payments arrears shall apply on a continuous basis throughout the
period of the arrangement. It shall not apply to external payments arrears arising from
external debt being renegotiated with external creditors, including Paris Club creditors; and
more specifically, to external payments arrears in respect of which a creditor has agreed that
no payment needs to be made pending negotiations.
20.
Expenditure arrears are defined as the difference between payment obligations due,
and actual payments made. They can arise on any expenditure item, including transfers, debt
service, wages, pensions, energy payments and goods and services. Expenditure arrears for
goods and services to suppliers are defined as obligations to suppliers, which are due but not
paid for more than 30 days and are non-disputed. Arrears between the state budget, local
government, social and health funds, and all extrabudgetary funds are not counted towards
the expenditure arrears’ ceiling on the general government.
IV. ADJUSTERS
21.
In the event that privatization receipts exceed the program assumptions, the limits on
the overall cash deficit of the general government will not be increased.
22.
In case disbursements of external loans exceed the program assumptions, the limits
on the overall cash deficit of the general government will be increased by the corresponding
magnitude up to a cumulative cap of lei 200 million. In case of shortfalls, the limits will be
decreased by the full amount.
23.
The limits on the overall cash deficit of the general government will be increased by
the amount of paid in cash for recapitalization of the NBM or by the face value of
government securities issued for the same purpose.

REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA
Debt Sustainability Analysis
Prepared by the staffs of the International Development Association
and the International Monetary Fund
Approved by Luca Barbone and Carlos Braga (World Bank)
and Juha Kähkönen and Anthony Boote (IMF)
February 20, 2008
The joint Bank-Fund low-income country debt sustainability analysis (LIC DSA) indicates
that Moldova’s risk of debt distress is low. The public DSA suggests that Moldova’s overall
public sector debt dynamics are sustainable in light of the current size and the evolution of
the domestic debt stock.1
A.

Background

1.
Moldova’s debt situation has improved since the last DSA in mid-2007, mostly
due to GDP growth. At the time of the inception of the PRGF arrangement in May 2006,
short-term financing needs stemmed from the projected financing gaps from external shocks
and the stock of arrears owed to bilateral creditors (mainly Russia, the US and Japan). The
latter concerns were subsequently resolved through Paris Club rescheduling in May 2006.
Debts covered under the agreement were 33 percent of Moldova’s total debt stock, based on
end-April 2006 numbers.2 However, the reduction in external debt from this deal was not as
dramatic as it had been from 2000–2005: external debt was 124 percent of GDP in 2000
(with public debts totaling 95 percent of GDP), falling to 56 percent of GDP in 2005
(27 percent of GDP for public debt).3
2.
Prospects for continuing official donor assistance are good. In response to the twin
external shocks—doubling of energy prices and Russia’s ban on imports of Moldovan
wine—large commitments were made by donors at the December 2006 Consultative Group
1

The DSA has been produced in consultation with the EBRD. Moldova is now above the threshold for IDAonly eligibility, and should also no longer be judged as a weak performer, given improved CPIA ratings.

2
3

Moldova owed Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, and the US a total of $274 million, out of $822 million.

The rapid fall in debt to GDP was mainly due to strong GDP growth; the nominal amount of debt remained
relatively constant.

2
meeting (primarily grants and technical assistance) and are beginning to materialize, although
disbursements in 2007 were slower than hoped for. Moldova has also qualified for grants
from the Millennium Challenge Corporation, reducing the pressure to borrow for growthenhancing investments.
3.
A significant fraction of external debt is on concessional terms, and will remain
so. Table 1 illustrates the preponderance of debt owed to multilateral lenders on concessional
terms and the likely evolution from future disbursements. Most borrowing in the near term is
forecast to be on concessional terms, either directly or through integrated loan arrangements
that incorporate grants. Over the longer term, as Moldova becomes an IDA-IBRD blend
country, borrowing will continue to be primarily from multilateral lenders, but will become
less concessional. Loans from commercial creditors make up a very small fraction of the
total.

4.
Private external debt is growing, with loans associated with FDI becoming more
important. Private external debt can be divided between regular loans (classified as
liabilities under other capital in the capital account), loans associated with FDI transactions,
and energy arrears. In 2001 new disbursements from FDI-linked loans comprised 35 percent
of new borrowing, but by 2007 the proportion was 67 percent (based on the first three
quarters). Private debt is also increasingly denominated in euros – 20 percent in 2006
compared with only 6 percent in 2002. This is a welcome trend, given the natural hedge from
remittances denominated in euros and the strengthening trade linkages.

3
5.
The increase in energy prices led to private external arrears. There is a large
outstanding stock of historic debt from unpaid energy bills (mostly from the 1990s between
Moldovagaz and suppliers, totaling $320 million at end-2006), but in recent years current
payments at least have been made. However, while electricity and natural gas tariffs are set at
cost recovery, tariffs for heat are below that level causing Moldovagaz to run arrears of about
$34 million to Gazprom in 2006, and early indications are that arrears will continue in 2007.
Heating tariffs are now set by municipalities to be at cost-recovery levels, as determined by
an independent regulator.
B.

Underlying Assumptions

6.
The macroeconomic framework has changed substantially since the last DSA.
The main cause has been a shift away from remittances as the driver of growth, as
developments in Moldova increasingly mirror those in other transition economies, and
growth prospects improve. Investments have begun to grow strongly - FDI in 2007 nearly
doubled as a percent of GDP, from 6.6 in 2006 to 12.4 percent in 2007. Private debt over the
medium-term is also forecast to grow substantially, supported by improvements in the
business climate. The government has established a good track record of macroeconomic
stability, improved the supervisory framework, and is streamlining the regulatory
environment.
7.
Box 1 summarizes the medium-term macroeconomic assumptions underlying the
DSA. Growth prospects have improved, driven by higher investments. Inflation should
subside to single-digit levels by end-2008, with additional benefits to the business
environment and poverty. Export growth will be supported by the resumption of wine exports
to Russia and the recent autonomous trade preferences agreement with the EU. However,
remittances will continue to finance the trade deficit. Moldova has one of the highest
proportions of overall remittances (including remittances and compensation of employees) to
GDP in the world, 37 percent in 2007, and investments have begun to grow strongly. FDI in
2007 nearly doubled as a percent of GDP, from 6.6 in 2006 to 12.4 percent in 2007. Nominal
growth of remittances (in US$) has averaged 40 percent since 2001, reaching a peak of 54
percent in 2003 and subsiding to 38 percent in 2007. Strong growth in the euro area provides
incentives to work abroad, but border crossings are now complicated by the accession of
Romania to the EU at the beginning of 2007 (because of new visa requirements).
8.
The overall fiscal deficit is expected to remain at about 0.5 percent of GDP over
the medium term, permitting modest primary surpluses to accumulate. High levels of
remittances and investments should continue to feed import growth, VAT and excises on
which will bolster revenue. Recent policies, such as an increase in civil service wages are
expected to be offset by a medium-term rationalization of public sector employment. Despite
the increase in donor assistance for capital expenditures over the next few years, there is not
a large growth dividend built into the baseline scenario. Indeed, growth of 6 percent over the
medium term is roughly what Moldova had after the Russian crisis and before the shocks of
2006 and 2007.

4

Box 1. Moldova – Macroeconomic Assumptions
The macroeconomic assumptions have improved since the last DSA: growth will remain
strong, inflation will subside, with continuing current account deficits and primary government
surpluses.
Real GDP growth is projected at 5 percent in 2007, rising to 7 percent or above in 2008-09, and gradually
declining thereafter. While this is higher than the historical average, the past decade included two years of severe
recession in the aftermath of the Russian crisis of 1998 causing average growth rates to fall and volatility to rise.
In the post-crisis period (2001–2006) real growth averaged 6.6 percent.
Inflation is projected to subside to the single-digit range by end-2008, falling to three percent by 2027 (as
measured by the GDP deflator). This is considerably lower than the historical average of 16 percent, but measures
taken under the program should ensure the National Bank of Moldova keeps a tight rein on monetary policy.
The current account is projected to continue to be supported by strong remittances, which in 2007 are estimated
to have reached 37 percent of GDP. As remittances largely feed into consumption and imports, changes in flows
largely net out with respect to the current account deficit. The improved prospects for the business environment
have also raised capital inflows, in particular direct investment. Exports, which were down sharply after the
Russian ban on wine, are growing strongly, both in wine (especially now that exports to Russia have resumed),
and in other goods.
The overall fiscal balance is expected to remain negative, but with a small deficit. Grant assistance from donors,
especially the European Union, is projected to increase, as are project loans that flow through the budget. This
fiscal stance reflects the need to increase capital investment and social spending over the medium-term.

C.

External Debt Sustainability

9.
External public debt and debt-service ratios remain well below the thresholds in
the baseline and historical scenarios. External debt and debt-service to exports ratios are
well within the relevant limits, despite the continuing effects of the Russian ban on wine
(Figure A1). Included in the baseline are higher disbursements of concessional loans over the
next four years. An alternative scenario (A2 in Table A2) that examines the effects of less
concessional terms on loans indicates no breach of the thresholds either.
10.
In staffs view, the most worrisome possibility is a fall in transfers.4 This
alternative scenario (B4 in Table A2) shows the effects of a shock of one standard deviation
below the historical average of net non-debt generating inflows in 2008-09 (which are
primarily remittances in Moldova at this point). This illustrates Moldova’s reliance on
remittances. The baseline scenario assumes that remittances plateau at the current percent of
GDP. However, should the labor environment abroad become less welcoming, or a
4

The most extreme shock, the combination of other bound tests (B5), also shows a temporary breach of the
threshold for the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio. However, staff judge this scenario to be less likely in practice than
the scenario incorporating a fall in transfers.

5
slowdown in Russia or the EU (the two main destinations) occur, migrants may find it more
difficult to maintain their level of support to dependants in Moldova. On the other hand, as
remittance flows tend to be much less volatile than other types of inflows, such as portfolio
investment, the chances for them to reverse appear slim.5 Under this scenario, the threshold
for the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio is breached in 2009. Despite this temporary breach, staffs
still characterize Moldova as a low risk of debt distress, given the good track record of
macroeconomic stability the authorities have established in the face of shocks. Note also that
given the robust increased in remittances experienced in the last three years, the magnitude of
the shock is most likely exaggerated.

D.

Public Debt Sustainability

11.
Public debt and debt-service to revenue ratios remain well below the
appropriate thresholds in both the baseline and historical scenarios. Public domestic
debt has remained steady at about 25 percent of total public debt, and is held primarily by the
National Bank of Moldova. While there are no thresholds as to the appropriate level, the
proportion held domestically is likely to increase in the future as domestic financial markets
become more developed. As there were primary surpluses in recent years, the historical
scenario shows how quickly all public debt could be paid off: the debt and debt-service ratios
all become negative before 2020. In practice, this is unlikely to occur, especially considering
Moldova’s significant and widely-recognized needs to upgrade infrastructure and make other
capital investments to lay the foundation for future growth.
5

While the annual growth rate of remittances has been over 30 percent since 2001, experiences from other
countries do not imply equal risks of large negative growth. In addition, remittance growth in the first quarter of
2007 is estimated at 29 percent, and the robust growth in the euro area is an upside risk.

6

12.
A recession in 2008-09 could potentially derail the positive trends depicted under
the baseline scenario. As shown in Figure A2 (and B1 in Table A4), a contraction in real
GDP growth of 1.6 percent in 2008 and 2009 (equivalent to a growth shock of one standard
deviation below the historical average growth rate) that is not accompanied by fiscal
expenditure adjustment would imply that the debt-to-GDP ratio rises above 30 percent by
2011, with a continuing increase in that ratio over the remaining projection period. Under this
scenario, with tax revenues falling with GDP, the failure to adjust nominal expenditures
implies that these expenditures rise as a share of GDP and give rise to a relatively large and
permanent primary deficit (4.5 percent of GDP) that would need to be financed. Adjusting
this expenditure path, as shown in Figure A2 (and B2a in Table A4), will be critical to
maintaining debt sustainability. Even if the expenditures are kept high during the recession to
provide fiscal stimulus, a gradual post-recession expenditure adjustment that restores fiscal
balances to closer to the baseline trajectory over the next five years will result in declining
debt burden ratios. Recent history has shown the resilience of the Moldovan economy to
external shocks. More importantly, policy makers have not hesitated to undertake fiscal
adjustment to maintain their record of fiscal prudence.

Conclusions

13.
Moldova’s external debt outlook is favorable, with a low risk of debt distress,
despite some temporary breaches in the threshold for the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio under
two scenarios.
14.
In the face of some severe shocks in 2006, the Moldovan authorities did not
resort to excessive borrowing. This led to an agreement with the Paris Club and
commitments by the Consultative Group that have bolstered debt sustainability. Good
macroeconomic management has also laid the groundwork for future investment-led growth,
improving the situation further. Given Moldova’s development needs, there appears to be
room for modest additional borrowing for infrastructure and other high priority projects, as
long as such borrowing remains prudent. Absorptive capacity will likely be a more binding
constraint than debt sustainability, and since Moldova is now above the IDA-only threshold,
opportunities for concessional borrowing should be appropriately examined in the context of
the medium-term expenditure framework in the near term.
15.
There is a possibility some remittances should be reclassified as investments.
Recent analysis of disaggregated data by the NBM revealed some very large transactions,
accounting for a substantial proportion of total money transfers, and the authorities have
initiated the process of reclassifying remittances. It is likely that these were intended as
payments for goods or services, but were channeled as personal transfers due to lower
transaction and administrative costs. This revision might ensure a better consistency with
survey data on remittances. A 2006 household survey conducted by CBS-Axa estimates that

7
overall remittances (including compensation of employees) were less than half of those
recorded in the BoP, implying that other transfers may be intended for investment.
16.
However, a reclassification should not change the assessment of a low risk of
debt distress. The risk of a sudden fall in remittances would be mitigated, as financing
sources would be more diversified. Although the impact of a recession or a slowdown in
exports would be greater if a substantial fraction of remittances were reclassified as
investments, growth would also be more robust, given a better basis on both consumption
and investment. Moldova is well below the thresholds for the existing scenarios. However,
when more information about the extent of a reclassification is available, these risks should
be explored more fully.
17.
Although the risk is low, there are some vulnerabilities. The external outlook
remains dependent on remittances, which have expanded rapidly in recent years, but this is
tempered by the increase in investments. An interruption in the ability of migrants to support
dependents in Moldova, or a reversal of investment growth would significantly affect the
sustainability of debt. In addition, the recent Financial Sector Assessment Program update
pointed to the need to deepen financial reforms, which would improve the sector’s ability to
intermediate flows. Improving the business climate so that internal growth can attract
migrants back into the country and maintain the pace of private investments would improve
resilience. In addition, a temporary recession would cause the public fiscal situation to
deteriorate rapidly. A smaller government as a proportion of GDP would be less likely to
endanger debt sustainability.

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA
Staff Report for 2007 Article IV Consultation and the Third Review under the Poverty
Reduction and Growth Facility––Informational Annexes
Prepared by the European Department
(In consultation with other departments and the World Bank)
February 20, 2008
Mission dates

December 5 – 21, 2007

Team

G. Justice (head), N. Gigineishvili, S. Hida, M. Piatkowski (all EUR), I. Asmundson (PDR)
and J. Mathisen (resident representative).

Area covered
by the
consultation

The consultation covered only the government-controlled areas on the “right bank” of the
Dniester River, and did not consider the areas not under the government’s control on the “left
bank,” hereinafter referred to as Transnistria.

PRGF

The three-year PRGF arrangement was approved with the conclusion of the 2006 Article IV
consultation on May 5, 2006. Cumulative access was SDR 80.08 million (65 percent of quota).
Owing to external shocks faced by Moldova, and in light of the authorities’ adjustment efforts,
cumulative access was increased to SDR 110.88 million (90 percent of quota) at the first
review on December 15, 2006, and SDR 31.97 million was disbursed at that time, and SDR
21.7 million following completion of the second review on July 13, 2007. Upon completion of
the third review, a disbursement of SDR 11.44 million will become available.

Exchange
system

Moldova has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3 and 4, of the Fund’s
Articles of Agreement. Its exchange system remains free of restrictions on payments and
transfers for current international transactions (Annex I).

Donor
coordination

The mission liaised with the World Bank (Annex II), the EBRD (Annex III), the UNDP and
other donors, particularly the European Commission.

Data

National Bureau of Statistics (http://www.statistica.md/), National Bank of Moldova
(http://www.bnm.org/english/index_en.html), Ministry of Finance (www.moldova.md).
Despite some weaknesses, data provision is adequate for surveillance, and Moldova subscribes
to the SDDS (Annex IV).

Outreach and
publication

The mission met with members of parliament, trade unions, industry, the financial sector,
NGOs, and the academic community. A press briefing was held at the end of the mission
and—for the first time—the Concluding Statement was published
(http://www.imf.org/external/np/ms/2007/123107.htm). The authorities have agreed to
publication of the staff report and all program documents. The mission also held—in
collaboration with the NBM—an international conference on monetary policy transmission.

Disbursements made after November 28, 2000—with the exception of disbursements of emergency assistance
and loans from the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility—are expected to be repaid on the expectations
schedule. Countries may request the IMF Executive Board to make repayments according to the obligations
schedule if their external payments position is not strong enough to meet the repayment expectations without
undue hardship or risk. Please note: Repayments under the Supplemental Reserve Facility are scheduled to be
repaid on the expectations schedule.

VII.

Safeguards Assessments:

Under the Fund's safeguards assessment policy, the National Bank of Moldova (NBM) is
subject to an assessment with respect to the PRGF arrangement approved on May 5, 2006
and its subsequent augmentation requested in November 2006. The assessment was
completed on October 13, 2006 and concluded that safeguards in place at the NBM appear
adequate, however, certain vulnerabilities were identified in the governance and control
system. Recommendations made to address these vulnerabilities have been implemented
according to information received from the authorities.
VIII.

Exchange Arrangement:

Moldova has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3 and 4, of the Fund’s
Articles of Agreement. Its exchange system remains free of restrictions on payments and
transfers for current international transactions.
Moldova’s exchange rate regime was reclassified from a de facto peg (to the U.S. dollar) to a
managed float in April 2006.
Prior to the introduction of the Moldovan leu on November 29, 1993, the Russian ruble
(supplemented by NBM-issued ruble denominated coupons) was the legal tender in
Moldova. The government introduced the leu at a conversion rate of one leu equal to
1,000 Moldovan rubles and an exchange rate of one dollar equal to lei 3.85. The leu
remained broadly stable around MDL 4.75/$ until mid-October 1998. It has since depreciated
against the dollar and traded at MDL 11.32=$1 on December 31, 2007.
Foreign exchange was initially traded on the Chişinău Interbank Foreign Currency Exchange
(CIFCE). Operations of the CIFCE started at the beginning of 1993, and daily auctions
commenced in early February 1995. An active foreign exchange cash market exists within
authorized banks and foreign exchange bureaus. From November 16, 1993 through endOctober 1998, the U.S. dollar exchange rate established in the CIFCE was the official
exchange rate quoted by the NBM. Since November 2, 1998, the official rate as announced
by the NBM is determined as the weighted average of all daily market transactions. The
NBM quotes exchange rates of the leu for other currencies on the basis of the leu-U.S. dollar
rate and the cross-rate relationships between the U.S. dollar and the currencies concerned in
the international market.

XI.

Use of Fund Resources:

On February 4, 1993, Moldova purchased Fund resources totaling SDR 13.5 million,
equivalent to 15 percent of quota under the Compensatory and Contingency Financing
Facilities (CCFF). This was followed by a first drawing under the Systemic Transformation
Facility (STF) of SDR 22.5 million, equivalent to 25 percent of quota, which was approved
by the Board on September 16, 1993. On December 17, 1993, the Board approved a purchase
of Fund resources under a stand-by arrangement (SBA) in the amount of SDR 51.75 million
and the drawing of the second tranche of the STF totaling SDR 22.5 million. On
December 19, 1994, Moldova made a second purchase under the CCFF totaling
SDR 12.2 million, equivalent to 13.5 percent of quota, in conjunction with the second review
of the SBA that expired at end-March 1995. The Board approved a successor SBA for
Moldova in an amount totaling SDR 58.50 million (equivalent to 65 percent of quota) on
March 22, 1995. Three purchases, totaling SDR 32.4 million (equivalent to 36 percent of
quota), were made under the arrangement. An Extended Arrangement amounting to
SDR 135 million (equivalent to 150 percent of old quota) was approved by the Executive
Board on May 20, 1996. At the time of the third review, the program was extended by one
year to May 19, 2000. While the fourth review was completed; the program expired on
May 19, 2000 without the completion of the scheduled last review because parliament
rejected twice an important program condition. Five purchases totaling SDR 87.5 million
(equivalent to 97 percent of old quota) were made under the EFF arrangement. A PRGF
arrangement was approved on December 21, 2000 in the amount of SDR 110.88 million
(equivalent to 90 percent of quota). SDR 9.24 million was disbursed on December 29, 2000,
followed by SDR 9.24 million on February 23, 2001, and SDR 9.24 million on July 26, 2002.
The arrangement expired in December 2003 with only one review completed. A new PRGF
arrangement was approved on May 5, 2006 (IMF Country Report No. 06/184) in the amount
of SDR 80.08 million (equivalent to 65 percent of quota). SDR 11.44 million was disbursed
on May 10, 2006. An augmented arrangement was approved on December 15, 2006 (IMF
Country Report No. 07/45) in the amount of SDR 110.88 million (equivalent to 90 percent of
quota). SDR 31.97 million was disbursed on December 21, 2006, and SDR 21.71 million was
disbursed on July 30, 2007, following completion of the second review on July 13, 2007
(IMF Country Report No. 07/275).

ANNEX II: MOLDOVA—IMF-WORLD BANK RELATIONS
(As of January 29, 2008)
Country Director: Mr. Paul Bermingham
A.

Telephone: +380 44 490 06671

Partnership in Moldova’s Development Strategy

1.
Moldova’s development agenda for 2004 to 2007 had been set out in its Economic
Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (EGPRSP). The EGPRSP was presented to
the Boards of the International Development Association (IDA) and the IMF in
November 2004. In December 2007, following a broad-based, participatory consultation
process, the Parliament approved the successor to the EGPRSP, i.e. the National
Development Strategy (NDS). The President of Moldova promulgated the NDS in January
2008. The NDS will be presented to the Boards of the International Development
Association (IDA) and the IMF in March 2008. The 2008 Joint Staff Advisory Note (JSAN)
provides the government with advice on future implementation of the NDS. The document
describes the participatory process underpinning the development of the strategy, provides a
diagnostic of poverty, and presents sector programs and policy measures for sustainable
economic growth and poverty.
2.
The IMF has taken the lead in assisting Moldova in promoting and maintaining
macroeconomic stability through prudent monetary and financial policies. In this regard the
Fund has encouraged the Moldovan authorities to implement a policy reform agenda that
would attract the needed level of concessional foreign financing from bilateral and
multilateral creditors and encourage the international community to reschedule Moldova’s
external debt to enhance debt sustainability. The Fund has supported Moldova’s economic
reform program since 1993. The last three-year PRGF program was approved on
May 5, 2006.
3.
The World Bank has taken the lead in the policy dialogue on a number of structural
issues relevant to economic growth and poverty reduction, including private sector
development, infrastructure, health, education, social protection, and agricultural sector
reforms.
4.
On October 19, 2006 the Bank Executive Board approved a US$10.0 million Poverty
Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) for Moldova. The credit, the first in a planned annual
series, aimed to support the Government’s efforts to accelerate economic growth and
improve the efficiency of its social programs and public administration. It directly supported
implementation of Moldova’s EGPRSP, as well as the EU-Moldova Action Plan. PRSC2
(US$10 million) is currently under preparation and will be presented to the IDA Board of
Directors in April 2008. The PRSC program supports selected areas of the Government
reform agenda with the objective of: (i) improving the investment climate; (ii) improving the
efficiency and management of public resources; and (iii) strengthening pension and social
assistance systems. It is expected that the implementation of the reform program supported
by the PRSC will contribute to improved business environment and investment climate,

10
leading to an increase in the quality of growth and poverty reduction, particularly in the rural
areas. A more professional civil service combined with increased transparency and
accountability of public finances with improved public expenditure management and
strategic allocation of resources is also an important part of the reform program supported by
the Credit. Given the recent increases in the price of imported energy, the PRSC also
supports the Government’s efforts in strengthening existing social safety nets for vulnerable
groups by completing the 1999 pension reform and improving the targeting of social
assistance programs.
5.
On December 12, 2006, the World Bank together with the European Commission
hosted a Consultative Group Meeting for Moldova. The meeting assessed progress in the
implementation of the country’s reform program and provided indications of additional
external financing. Moldova’s development partners expressed their support for the
authorities’ strategy and indicated financial support totaling more than US$ 1.2 billion
(almost 1 billion €) over the next three years, of which 25 percent is in budgetary and balance
of payment support.
6.
Recent analytical work of the Bank includes a Public Expenditure Management
Review, an Investment Climate Assessment, a Country Procurement Assessment Review, a
Country Financial Accountability Assessment, a Trade Diagnostic Study, the second Poverty
Assessment, an Education Policy Note, a Health Policy Note, an Agricultural Note, a
Country Economic Memorandum and a Public Expenditure Review. Bank is also providing
technical assistance to the government in the areas of poverty monitoring, public
administration and civil service reform and governance, and social protection.
7.
In a number of areas—social sectors, environment, infrastructure—the Bank takes the
lead in the dialogue. The Bank is also leading in the areas of support for the private sector
development and agricultural sector reform. Bank analysis serves as input into the Fund
program. In other areas—trade and customs reform, financial sector policies, public sector
management—both institutions work together. Finally, in areas like fiscal, monetary, and
exchange rate policies, and tax administration, the IMF takes the lead.

B.

IMF-World Bank Collaboration in Specific Areas
Areas in which the World Bank leads

8.
Areas in which the Bank leads the policy dialogue are social sectors, infrastructure,
and environment. In the social sphere, the Bank has carried out Poverty Assessments to
monitor and evaluate progress in alleviating poverty. A second poverty assessment has
recently been completed. A Health and Social Assistance Project supports the
implementation of comprehensive reform of the public pension system and the introduction
of a regulatory framework for private pension funds. The project also supports the
implementation of the new organizational structure for social insurance. The Bank has also
supported two Social Investment Fund (SIF) Projects to assist in the building of local
community and municipal capacity and skills through the rehabilitation of social

11
infrastructure. The SIF also focuses on improving the delivery of social services, creating
short-term employment and opportunities in rural areas by financing small-scale public
works and supporting micro-business development.
9.
In health, the Health and Social Assistance Project is focused on improving the
health status of the Moldovan population and increasing the quality and efficiency of public
health services by improving access to essential services by the poor. The Moldova AIDS
Control Project aims at improving Moldova’s health status and assists in achieving the
health-related Millennium Development Goals by reducing mortality, morbidity, and
transmission of HIV/AIDS. An additional operation to help Moldova combat Avian Influenza
is under implementation.
10.
In education, the Quality Education in Rural Areas Project supports the
Government's education program to enhance the quality of teaching and learning, increase
access and equity, improve the efficiency in public spending for education, and strengthen
education planning and monitoring.
11.
With regards to infrastructure development, the Bank is concentrating on upgrading
basic utility services impacting the population at large and the poor in particular. The Energy
II Project has two main components: (i) power system infrastructure—investments to
upgrade and rehabilitate metering, dispatch and communications, selected priority
rehabilitation of the electricity of the electricity transmission network, and institutional
development and regulation of the electricity market; and (ii) heating supply and
consumption—investments in improving heating supply and energy efficiency in selected
public buildings. A Pilot Water Supply and Sanitation Project is aimed at enhancing the
welfare of the population living in some of the poorest rural areas and medium-sized towns
and cities by improving the quality, efficiency, and sustainability of water supply and
sanitation services by rehabilitating and improving operations of selected water and sewage
systems to increase service quality and efficiency, improving the financial viability and
commercial practices of the participating utilities, and involving the private sector in the
sector. The Moldova Road Sector Program Support Project was approved by the Board in
FY07 and a National Water Supply and Sanitation Project is under preparation for Board
consideration in May 2008.
12.
The Bank has supported a number of environmental projects. The Agriculture
Pollution Control Project focuses on significantly increasing the use of environmentally
friendly agricultural practices by farmers and agro-industry thereby reducing nutrient
discharge from agricultural sources into the Danube River and Black Sea. A number of
technical assistance activities are also under implementation. A Biodiversity Strategy
Development is assisting the government in implementing Articles 6 and 8 of the Convention
on Biological Diversity. The project also supports the formulation and adoption of strategies
and actions for the protection and sustainable use of bio-diversity, through a participatory
process involving the public and private sectors and local NGOs. The Environmental
Infrastructure Project was approved by the Board in FY07. The objectives of the project are
to improve the quality of sanitary services in Northern Moldova and reduce the discharge of

12
pollutants, including nutrients into the Nistru River and demonstrate and disseminate costeffective nutrient reduction strategies and technologies for municipal wastewater sources.
13.
In the area of rural and agricultural development, the Bank’s recently closed First
Cadastre Project has initiated the first cadastre, implemented a rural land registration system,
and helped develop the institutional framework to complete and manage the legal cadastre in
urban areas. The project helped establish a system of clear and enforceable ownership rights
so as to promote the privatization of land the development of real markets in Moldova. The
two Rural Investment and Services Projects (RISP1 and RISP2) increase rural incomes and
living standards by promoting rural entrepreneurship, agricultural production, economic
diversification, and trade in the rural areas. The projects provide public investment support to
alleviate key institutional constraints in farmer’s group formation, supporting development of
marketing institutions and infrastructure for improved access to input and output markets,
and developing a rural advisory service. The projects also provide investment and working
capital at commercial terms to support a broad range of agribusiness. Additional financing
to RISP2 is under preparation for IDA Board consideration in June 2008. The purpose of the
additional financing is to provide support to irrigation, especially in the wake of the
devastating 2007 drought.
14.
While the Bank has taken the lead in the areas of the structural reform described
above, the IMF has a strong interest in these areas since many of them are critical to
achieving macroeconomic stabilization and enhancing growth prospects. Accordingly, there
is a high degree of consultation and coordination between the two institutions on these
matters.
Areas of shared responsibility
15.

The Bank and Fund are working jointly in a number of areas:

16.
Private Sector Development. While substantial progress in improving Moldova’s
business environment has been made, a challenging reform agenda remains. Both the Bank
and the Fund have focused on this agenda in their assistance programs, including SAC III
and PRGF arrangement and the surveillance exercise. The Bank has undertaken a number of
studies, including the Investment Climate Assessment, the Business Environment and
Enterprise Performance Survey (together with EBRD), a Diagnostic Review of the
Environment for Foreign Investment, and a number of Costs of Doing Business Surveys, to
gauge ongoing developments in this area and determine the most important impediments to
private sector development. The Bank’s Private Sector Development II (PSD II) Project
strengthened the competitiveness of private and public enterprises in Moldova through the
hands-on training of local managers abroad (human capital investment) and creation of a
Competitiveness Center (market information and benchmarking). The Competitiveness
Enhancement Project builds upon successes of the PSD II credit by providing support for the
business environment improvement and modernization of the standardization and metrology
system. The IFC has promoted financial sector development by extending credit lines to a
number of private banks for on-lending to private sector. The Fund has focused on policies
needed to maintain a stable macroeconomic environment and remove obstacles to growth,

13
thus encouraging private sector activities. A number of technical assistance missions have
been undertaken to improve banking legislation and banking supervision, including the joint
Financial Sector Assessment Program. A joint IMF-World Bank FSAP Update has just
recently been completed.
17.
In the area of Public Sector Management, the Bank’s Public Economic
Management Review, Country Procurement Assessment Review and Country Financial
Accountability Assessment examine fiscal adjustment and reform efforts in the social sectors
and suggest policy measures to strengthen public expenditure management and actions
needed to build capacity for increased government effectiveness. The Country Economic
Memorandum entitled Moldova: Opportunities for Accelerated Growth contains
recommendations for improving the macroeconomic environment, enhancing the
opportunities presented by the large inflow of remittances, creating a more dynamic and
diversified private sector. The recently closed Bank project Trade and Transportation
Facilitation in Southeast Europe (part of the Stability Pact initiative), aimed to strengthen
and modernize the Customs Administration and other border control agencies with the
objective reducing non-tariff costs to trade and transport and preventing smuggling and
corruption at border crossings. The Public Finance Management Project is helping the
Moldovan Authorities to develop a budget planning and execution system by
institutionalizing the medium-term expenditure planning and modernizing budget
classification, and is assisting in upgrading the internal control and audit system in the
central government bodies. The Fund has also provided technical assistance to improve tax
and customs administration, government financial statistics, and public expenditure policies.
Areas in which the IMF leads
18.
The Fund takes the lead in the formulation and execution of fiscal and monetary
policies, external policies, and issues involving economic and financial statistics. In the
budgetary area, the Fund leads the dialogue on fiscal matters, taking the lead on tax policy
and reforms.
19.
In these areas the Bank takes into account the policy recommendations of the IMF
and ensures that its own policy advice is consistent.
C.

The World Bank Group Strategy

20.
The main objective of the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Moldova for the
period of FY04-FY08 (November 2004 Boar discussion ) is to support the implementation of
the government’s EGPRSP and capitalize on the gains of previous assistance programs.
21.
A CAS Progress Report was presented for the Executive Board’s review on
October 19, 2006. It assessed the implementation of the Strategy and discussed adjustments
to the program for the remaining two years of the current CAS period. It was proposed to put
in place an annual PRSC program of approximately US$10 million per operation, starting in
FY07. The balance of the available IDA allocation would be made available for investment
operations drawn from roads, health and social protection, and agriculture and rural
development.

14
22.
A CAS Completion and the 2009-2012 Country Partnership Strategy are currently
under preparation, the latter of which will include a continuation of the annual PRSC
program with a highly selective number of investment operations in the areas of the Bank’s
comparative advantage.

15
ANNEX III: MOLDOVA—RELATIONS WITH THE EBRD
(As of end 2007)
The EBRD’s strategy in Moldova is aimed primarily at supporting private sector
development in the country and increasing policy dialogue with the authorities. In particular,
the Bank will pursue the following operational objectives:
I. The Bank will continue to pursue investment opportunities in all enterprise sectors
including, without limitation, the food processing, manufacturing, information and
communication technology (ICT), retail and property sectors. Well performing
companies will be provided with direct financing including through ETC instruments.
The Bank will facilitate foreign investment either by investing alongside foreign
strategic investors or by assisting the development of local companies which in due
course may attract foreign investment. Working capital may be provided to
agribusinesses under the recently established warehouse receipt system. The Bank will
continue to provide non-financial support to private enterprises through its Turn Around
Management (TAM) and Business Advisory Services (BAS) programmes;
II. The Bank will provide its local partner banks with access to its SME and MSE credit
lines, its Trade Facilitation Programme (TFP) as well as its Medium-sized Co-financing
Facility (MCFF). The Bank will seek to extend its cooperation to new partner banks and
will assist in the development and promotion of new financial instruments such as
mortgage financing, leasing and energy efficiency credit lines. On the equity side, the
Bank may consider further investment in banks, leasing companies and mortgage
providers. The Bank will further enhance its support for the development of
microfinance particularly (but not exclusively) in Moldova’s regions. The Bank will
explore opportunities to support the emergence of the non-banking financial sector;
III. Given Moldova's sovereign debt capacity constraints and the IMF's concessionality
requirements, the Bank will - to the extent possible - co-finance public infrastructure
projects with other IFIs and donors to ensure maximum leverage of grant and
concessional financing. To enable Moldova to take full advantage of its new EU
neighborhood status, the Bank will give priority to infrastructure projects that promote
regional integration and interconnection with neighboring countries. The Bank is also
committed to resume its municipal infrastructure lending provided sufficient grant
financing can be attracted to address affordability constraints. The Bank will continue to
support private infrastructure investments.
Fifty nine projects have been signed totaling €222.2 million of EBRD resources, including: (i) a
wine export promotion project, which is targeting the main Moldovan wineries and glass
producer, through restructuring of the sector (€24.6 million) and equity investment into a glass
producer (€6.4 million); (ii) an energy efficiency project for upgrading the heating distribution
networks in Chisinau (€7.8 million); (iii) several credit lines and equity investment for Moldova-

16
Agroindbank for on-lending to small and medium enterprises (€29.3 million in total); (iv)
several credit lines, a co-financing facility and equity investment for Victoriabank (€12.5 million
in total); (v) three credit lines and a co-financing facility for Mobiasbanca (€6.4 million); (vi)
credit lines for Moldinconbank and Banca Sociala (€9.2 million in total);(v) a project for linking
Moldovan satellite earth stations to the Eurovision Network (€0.8 million); (vi) a road
rehabilitation loan (€9.6 million); (vii) partial financing for construction of a new oil terminal at
Giurgulesti (€9.6 million); (viii) credit facilities for micro enterprises through local banks
(€5.4 million); (ix) rehabilitating Chisinau’s water services (€17.6 million); (x) Chisinau Airport
Modernization (€7.4 million); (xi) trade facilitation program for Victoriabank, MoldovaAgroindbank, Moldindconbank, Mobiasbanca and Banca Sociala (regional TFP—€18.1 million
in total); (xii) equity participation in and a loan to ProCredit and a loan to Rural Finance
Corporation – two micro-finance companies (€3.2 million in total); (xiii) equity participation and
loan financing for three privatized power distribution companies (€26.9 million); (xiv) a loan
(MMF) totaling €3.0 million and a credit line of €5 million to Banca Sociala to extend mediumto long-term loans of up to €500,000; (xv) equity and loan participation for SUN
Communications (€1.9 and €3.7 million, sequentially); (xvi) a loan facility in the amount of up
to €30 million, including €12.5 million for Phase 1 and an uncommitted EUR 17.5 million for
Phase 2. ; (xvii) DLF Orhei Vit- a financing of new capital investments into the existing facilities
and increased working capital needs of the Company through a €4 million facility.
In addition to banking projects, some 79 Technical Cooperation projects have been
completed or approved (totaling €13.9 million).

17
ANNEX IV: MOLDOVA—STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Economic and financial data provided to the Fund are generally adequate for
surveillance and program monitoring. In July 2005, a ROSC Data Module found that while
the quality of macroeconomic statistics has improved significantly in many areas in the past
few years, accuracy and reliability need to be enhanced further regarding compilation of
fiscal and national accounts statistics.
2.
Moldova subscribed to the SDDS in May 2006, and became the sixth country which
has graduated from the GDDS to the SDDS. Participation in the GDDS began in February
2003.
3.
National accounts statistics are prepared according to the 1993 SNA methodology.
Estimates do not include the Transnistria region for which data have not been collected
since 1991. GDP is estimated from the production and the expenditure sides, annually and
quarterly. The data are prepared in current and constant (previous-year) prices, and annual
data are revised—in two stages—as updated information becomes available. However, the
quarterly data remain unadjusted, thus limiting their consistency with the revised annual data.
Overall, the national accounts statistics need improvement in the following areas: (i)
improving the accuracy of the data sources (quarterly reporting of all basic statistics on a
discrete basis, industrial production index and price indices following international
standards); (ii) benchmarking the annual and the quarterly data; and (iii) estimating the
consumption of fixed capital in line with international standards.
4.
Price statistics still have several shortcomings. Price collection for the CPI and PPI
is limited geographically and new observations are not imputed. The weights of the CPI
basket, underestimate the share of durable goods. The PPI is not a transaction price index,
and covers a small population of industrial establishments. The industrial production index is
compiled from data in constant prices adjusted to price changes by establishments
themselves.
5.
Labor market statistics have been substantially revised following the 2004
population census, substantially improving data reliability. While the methodology, training
and practices of surveyors have improved, the most substantial revision was the expansion of
sampling, thus achieving a more accurate reflection of the labor market situation. No
comprehensive attempt has been made to revise the old series based on new methodology.
6.
Fiscal statistics. In January 2008, the IMF Government Finance Statistics Advisor
for Southeastern Europe at the Ljubljana Center of Excellence in Finance (CEF) visited
Chisinau during January 21-25. The purpose of the visit was to develop an understanding of
and assess the environment for the production of government finance statistics ― both
annual and subannual ― according to the methodology of the GFSM 2001 and to discuss
with the authorities a work program for 2008 in that area. The authorities have indicated a

18
need to review the newly introduced budget classification, which will be undertaken in
liaison with the CEF Public Finance Management Advisor. The Advisor also has requested
the support of the MoF in reporting of monthly fiscal data (the GFSM 2001 Statement of
Sources and Uses of Cash) to STA for publication in International Financial Statistics. In
addition, World Bank technical assistance has been provided to improve the budgetary
reports of local authorities as well as the Social Fund. The authorities reported annual cashbased data through fiscal year 2006 in the GFSM 2001 format for publication in the 2007
GFS Yearbook.
7.
Balance of payments. The compilation methodology follows the fifth edition of the
Balance of Payments Manual. Problems remain related to: (i) under-reporting of imports and
exports; (ii) collection of data on services; (iii) measurement of private capital inflows,
including direct investment data; and (iv) treatment of transactions with Transnistria. Besides
the balance of payments statistics, Moldova disseminates quarterly international investment
position and external debt statistics. Data on international reserves and foreign currency
liquidity are disseminated monthly.
8.
Monetary and financial statistics are broadly in line with international statistical
standards and of a generally good quality. The NBM has compiled and submitted a complete
set of monetary data beginning from December 2001 using Standardized Report Forms
(SRFs). Monetary data are reported by the NBM on a regular basis and are being published
in the IFS Supplement. An STA technical assistance mission is scheduled for April 2008 to
assist in expanding the coverage of monetary statistics to include other financial
corporations.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with the
Republic of Moldova
On March 12, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with the Republic of Moldova.1
Background
Moldova is doing well, despite a series of consecutive shocks (the doubling of the price of
imported natural gas and Russia’s ban on imports of Moldovan wine in 2006, and a severe
drought in 2007). Growth is estimated at 5 percent in 2007 and is projected to increase to
7 percent in 2008. Investment is picking up, and is beginning to replace remittances as the main
source of growth––an encouraging sign that the earlier model of consumption-driven growth is
changing.
Moldova increasingly faces the challenges experienced by other transition economies.
Improved growth prospects have come with strong appreciation pressures from foreign
exchange inflows, and a widening trade deficit. FDI has picked up and is estimated to have
reached 12 percent of GDP in 2007, compared with 7 percent in 2006.
The main macroeconomic concern is inflation, which, at 13 percent, remains high for the region.
A deterioration in the merchandise trade balance due to strong import growth has been offset by
improvements in net income and transfers, with a small improvement in the current account

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

deficit to 12 percent of GDP. A resumption of wine exports to Russia in October was a major
positive development, although volumes are likely to recover slowly.
Fiscal policy remained tight, ending 2007 with a modest deficit of 0.3 percent of GDP Strong
revenue performance was driven by robust VAT on imports, while expenditure was kept in line
with the budget. However, the tax cuts introduced in 2008 may undermine the favorable fiscal
position.
Monetary tightening in 2007 was complicated by the strong inflow of foreign exchange. The
National Bank of Moldova increased reserve requirements from 10 to 15 percent, and raised
policy interest rates by 2.5 percentage points. Nevertheless, the possibility of second-round
effects from the drought, liquidity pressures from growing remittances and FDI, and the
continued strong growth in credit and broad money suggest that upside risks to inflation are not
yet fully contained.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the improved growth prospects and decline in poverty in
Moldova, and commended the authorities for their reform efforts and balanced macroeconomic
policies. Developments in Moldova appear to mirror increasingly those in other transition
economies, with large capital inflows, appreciation pressures on the national currency, and a
widening trade deficit. Directors underscored the importance of maintaining macroeconomic
stability and improving the business environment to support private sector development and to
help reverse the emigration of labor.
Directors considered that inflation remains high relative to that in other countries in the region,
even after accounting for the drought. They cautioned that with strong foreign exchange inflows
and rapid credit and reserve money growth, upside risks to inflation remain. The recent
monetary tightening by the National Bank of Moldova (NBM) was welcomed, as was its
commitment to establish price stability as its sole monetary policy objective. Directors noted that
with considerably lower labor costs and higher productivity growth in Moldova compared to the
region, there is scope for further exchange rate appreciation without undermining
competitiveness. They urged the central bank to allow greater exchange rate flexibility.
Directors commended the authorities for their disciplined fiscal policies. Modest deficits are an
appropriate compromise to balance development and disinflation objectives. Directors
welcomed the authorities’ efforts to strengthen tax administration and to increase social and
investment spending, while maintaining the deficit target. At the same time, they stressed that
the budget should remain tight until low single-digit inflation is firmly reestablished, and that any
spending related to potential overperformance on the revenue side should be conditional on
achieving the inflation objective.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ plans for reducing the size of the public sector, introducing a
transparent and competitive remuneration system for the public service, and consolidating
education and health care networks. These were seen as important steps toward a leaner

3
government structure to ensure efficient management of scarce public resources, and to allow
more room for pro-poor and pro-growth spending.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to bolster structural reforms aimed at improving
the investment climate and clarifying the role of the state in the economy. They were particularly
encouraged by the efforts to streamline the business licensing and registration procedures, to
improve the transparency of regulatory agencies and reduce red tape, and to strengthen
bankruptcy procedures and competition legislation. Directors supported the government’s
decision to revitalize the privatization process, including the intention to sell remaining large
state enterprises, which would help to reduce the weight of the state in the economy and
provide a catalyst for private sector growth.
Directors considered modernization of the energy sector as a high priority. They welcomed the
strengthened independence of the energy regulator and establishment of heat tariffs at a cost
recovery level, which will be critical for the financial viability of the utilities. At the same time,
they stressed that timely introduction of a new targeted social assistance scheme will be
essential to ease the burden of higher tariffs on the poor.
Directors noted that the financial sector is stable, and urged the authorities to be vigilant in
addressing the remaining vulnerabilities in the sector. Strengthening the supervisory and
regulatory framework and increasing the transparency of bank ownership will be crucial to
ensure the soundness of the banking system. Directors welcomed the authorities’ efforts to
accelerate privatization of Banca de Economii, which will help to enhance competition in the
banking sector and attract additional banking expertise. They urged the authorities to ensure
that the new AML/CFT law is implemented effectively.

Statement by Age Bakker, Executive Director for the Republic of Moldova
and Victor Yotzov, Advisor to Executive Director
March 12, 2008
The Moldovan authorities appreciate the continued constructive dialogue with the
management and staff over the last several years. They attach great value to the close
relationship with the Fund, whose advice continues to support the policy formation process in
Moldova. Now that the external shocks of 2006 seem to have receded, the authorities remain
firmly committed to stick to the core goals and policies agreed under the PRGF arrangement.
Those policies are consistent with the National Development Strategy (NDS) as well as with
the action plan agreed upon with the European Union. European aspirations and prospects of
growing financial assistance from the EU and international donors continue to complement
the authorities’ reform efforts.
For the years to come, Moldova’s overriding policy priority remains promoting
sustainable growth and reducing poverty. To this end, the policies set forth for 2008 aim at
further modernizing the public service and reducing state involvement in the economy,
developing the financial sector, creating a favorable investment environment, encouraging
the development of small and medium businesses, rehabilitating infrastructure, promoting
exports, and creating new jobs and providing social protection to vulnerable categories of the
population. As always, the authorities stand ready to take additional measures that may
become appropriate for reaching these objectives.
Recent developments and performance under the program
Macroeconomic developments in 2007 were favorable despite the severity of the external
shocks that the country suffered in the previous years. The economy grew strongly in the first
half of 2007, but slowed somewhat in the second half due to a weak harvest caused by the
summer drought. Nevertheless, excluding agriculture, growth remained robust. Importantly,
its pattern appears to be changing: there are already signs that the earlier model of
consumption-driven growth financed by remittances is shifting toward more sustainable
investment-based growth. Export performance, too, has stepped up considerably and the
recovery in the foreign sector is set to accelerate further as wine exports to Russia resumed
late last year. Even though imports in 2007 grew faster than exports, fuelled by rapidly
increasing FDI and strong remittances, the current account deficit has narrowed due to
improvements in net income and transfers. Strong inflows of foreign exchange led to an
appreciation of the leu, but the exchange rate remains broadly in line with fundamentals.
Recent favorable developments, however, have presented some challenges as well.
The most important among them are the surge in net capital inflows and the associated
appreciation pressures that complicate the conduct of monetary policy. On top of that,
inflation continues to be stubbornly in double digits, which requires additional fiscal efforts.
As similar trends have been observed and dealt with in other countries in the region and
elsewhere, the authorities are willing, with the help of the Fund, to benefit from their
experience so that negative consequences be mitigated to the extent possible.

2
Performance under the PRGF-supported program has been strong and except for a
few instances, the authorities have implemented the measures as stated in the last
Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies. All end-September quantitative
performance criteria were observed while only one quantitative benchmark was missed. All
structural PCs have been met but some structural benchmarks were missed, partly due to
technical reasons.
Given the strengthened independence of the National Agency for Energy Regulation
(ANRE), and the demonstrated effectiveness of the system for these items, the authorities
request to drop a continuous structural benchmark that electricity and natural gas tariffs
remain at cost-recovery levels. The authorities would also like to indicate that the missed
end-September structural benchmark on the transfer of tariff-setting responsibility for heat to
ANRE does not comply with the constitutional division of rights between local and central
governments and should therefore be dropped as well.
Fiscal Policy
Fiscal performance remained strong in 2007, as the year ended with a deficit of 0.3 percent of
GDP which was below the programmed 0.5 percent. Revenue performance was driven by
higher VAT on imports, while expenditures were kept in line with budget commitments.
Notwithstanding this achievement, fiscal policy continues to be severely constrained by two
conflicting needs – the need to substantially increase development spending in line with the
approved NDS, and the need to subdue rising inflation. In this regard, the authorities and
staff have agreed that fiscal policy should remain sufficiently tight until disinflation is
entrenched. Spending of revenue overperformance will be contingent on bringing inflation
down into the single-digit territory, and will be directed solely to investments. In line with
the above, the 2008 budget was approved in accordance with the disinflation objective,
implying higher negative domestic financing than in 2007. Negative domestic financing may
increase even further if privatization proceeds exceed projections. Any budget rectification
will be contemplated in the framework of the program and the upcoming fourth review.
In the medium-term, the authorities’ plan is to keep the budget deficit at about
0.5 percent of GDP, while providing for greater fiscal space for social and investment
spending through downsizing and reduction in spending inefficiencies. Further strengthening
of tax administration is also given high priority.
With regard to downsizing the role of the state in the economy and rationalizing the
structure of employment in the budget sector, the government just recently announced that it
is cutting 10 thousand budget-sector positions by 2010, starting with 3 thousand in 2008. In
addition, the authorities intend to pass a law that would consolidate all forms of remuneration
in base pay for civil servants by end-September 2008, with a view to implementing it in the
2009 budget. Public sector wages will be further increased in 2008 in order to keep qualified
workers, though the total wage bill as share of GDP is expected to remain unchanged owing
to a phasing in of the future increases.
The biggest change in the 2008 budget is the major reform of the corporate income
tax system, that cut the CIT rate to zero on reinvested profits, as well as a wide-ranging
amnesty of tax arrears and a liberalization of capital legalization regulations that aim at
promoting both foreign and domestic investment. The authorities are aware that these

3
reforms may imply certain risks, in particular with respect to budget revenues, but they
strongly believe that possible shortfalls will be compensated by improved tax collections.
For that purpose, the authorities will speed up the implementation of Tax Administration
Strengthening Strategy, including by reorganizing the State Tax Inspectorate. At the same
time, the authorities intend to develop a modern accounting and information technology
platform, and ensure adequate resources for these reforms.
Monetary Policy
Strong appreciation pressures caused by persistent inflows of foreign exchange have
continued to complicate monetary policy in 2007, facing the monetary authorities with
difficult choices. Despite the tightening up early in the year, reserve money continued to
grow which prompted the central bank to raise reserve requirements to 15 percent at endSeptember, accompanied by an increase in the sterilization rate. The build-up of reserves at
the end of the year exceeded US$ 1.3 billion which was well above what was projected under
the program. Against this background, and in order to clear up any misinterpretations
regarding its policy objectives, the NBM’s independence has been strengthened, while
disinflation was established as its central objective, with a planned move to an inflation
targeting framework over the medium-term.
The authorities and staff agreed that monetary policy should remain tight until
disinflation is firmly reestablished. To this end, the monetary program for 2008 envisages
locking in the overperformance in 2007 on NDA and NIR, and tighten reserve money to
ensure the objective of single-digit inflation is achieved. In addition, the NBM has declared
readiness to promptly increase reserve requirements and/or interest rates at the first signs of
reversal of trend disinflation. To further improve effectiveness of monetary policy, the NBM
will streamline its instruments by adopting a base rate as a main policy rate to remove the
ambiguity between the two rates, and shifting sterilization operations to shorter maturities. At
the same time, the planned securitization of the government debt to NBM in the first quarter
of 2008 will provide the central bank an additional liquidity management tool.
As regards the planned move to a formal inflation targeting framework, the
authorities acknowledge they are still at an early stage of implementation. Nevertheless, they
are undertaking important steps to improve the current framework of monetary policy and lay
the foundation for a new regime. In particular, starting with the 2008 Budget, the Budget
Law will no longer oblige the NBM to roll over state securities, including those acquired
through securitization. Instead, the NBM and the Ministry of Finance will conclude yearly
agreements on the annual redemption of state debt to the NBM. Further improvements are
also envisaged with respect to the communication strategy and policy transparency, aiming to
raise public awareness of risks to inflation as well as to strengthen the signaling function of
the NBM. In this regard, the authorities have requested technical assistance from the Fund in
monetary research and capacity building for monetary policy implementation.
Reform Agenda
With regard to financial sector reforms, the authorities continue to strengthen the
supervisory and regulatory framework and ensure transparency to promote stability and
steady development. Following the recommendations of the recent FSAP update all entities

4
licensed, regulated and supervised by the NBM and/or the NCFM have been excluded from
the provisions of the law #235 on the Core Principles of Regulating Entrepreneurial Activity.
In addition, the authorities are prepared to step-up their efforts in identifying beneficial
owners of banks and will study best international practices, especially those of EU countries,
in applying ‘fit and proper’ tests for significant shareholders.
With the assistance of the Fund, the parliament has recently adopted a new AntiMoney Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism Law. Moreover, the
authorities have committed to continue revision of associated laws to bring the AML/CFT
framework in conformity with the international standard. The authorities’ plan is to
strengthen the capacity of the Financial Intelligence Unit, as well as of the NBM in
preventing and combating money laundering and the financing of terrorism, and streamline
AML/CFT procedures to reduce the burden of compliance.
The expected enforcement of the autonomous trade preferences regime with the EU is
a major step forward. For businesses to benefit from the new trade regime, the government
intends to put efforts to improve the quality of management systems. In addition, to
encourage investment inflow into the national economy, the authorities plan to implement the
actions set by the 2008 Action Plan for the Implementation of the Strategy for Attracting
Investments and Promoting Export for 2006-2015. Strengthening of small and medium
business is one of the key elements that will contribute to economic growth and poverty
reduction. To support SME development, the Organization for SME Sector Development
was established, and its capacity will continue to be built in 2008.
Finally, the authorities assign high priority to the acceleration of the privatization of
public assets to attract know-how and promote private sector development. In this regard, the
expected privatization of Moldtelecom is viewed as of crucial importance. The authorities’
intentions are to continue the privatization of state assets through a competitive and
transparent process. Furthermore, in order to strengthen competition in the banking system,
the authorities intend to accelerate privatization of Banca de Economii (BEM) to a strategic
banking investor. As the previous plan to perform an independent valuation of the bank prior
to bringing it to market has stalled, the authorities have decided now to hire directly a
privatization advisor. A tender for selecting a privatization advisor is expected to be
announced by the end of March, and a contract for bringing BEM to market to be signed by
end-September 2008. In the meantime, the government and the NBM will continue to abstain
from granting preferential treatment to the bank, including as regards taxation, prudential
regulation or access to resources.
