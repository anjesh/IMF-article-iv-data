BARBADOS
Staff Report for the 2009 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2009 Article IV Consultation
with Barbados
Approved by Gilbert Terrier and David Marston
September 2, 2009

 Background. After barely growing in 2008, the Barbados economy is expected to
contract by 3 percent in 2009, buffeted by the global recession. Price pressures have
abated, and domestic demand has slowed. International reserves declined in recent
months, reflecting lower tourism receipts and private capital inflows but were recently
boosted by a successful international bond placement. Widening fiscal deficits in recent
years led to an increase in public debt to 106 percent of GDP at end-2008.
 Focus of consultation. Discussions focused on the impact of the global recession on
Barbados and the options and priorities to weather the crisis and ensure medium-term
macroeconomic stability and growth. The mission recommended early tightening of the
fiscal stance within a credible medium-term fiscal consolidation framework.
 Authorities’ views. The authorities are reluctant to tighten fiscal policy, on the
grounds that this would deepen the recession and weaken confidence. They are confident
that they can secure foreign financing to cover the budget shortfall and stabilize reserves.
 Exchange system. The Barbados dollar has been pegged to the U.S. dollar at the rate
of BDS$2.00=US$1.00 since 1975. Barbados has accepted the obligations of Article VIII,
Sections 2, 3, and 4, and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on current
account transactions. While at end-2008 the real effective exchange rate was close to its
estimated equilibrium, efforts should be intensified to address the risks to external stability
from large fiscal imbalances.
Mission. The team that visited Bridgetown during July 10–17 comprised
Trevor Alleyne (head), Gamal El-Masry, Usman Khosa, and Carla Macario (all WHD).
Michael Horgan (Executive Director) and Pierre St-Amant (OED, Senior Advisor)
participated in the concluding discussions. The team met with Prime Minister
David Thompson; Minister of State (Finance) Senator Darcy Boyce; Central Bank
Governor Dr. Marion Williams; other senior government officials; and representatives of
the private sector and labor.

I. BACKGROUND AND ECONOMIC OUTLOOK
1.
Barbados has strong public and
private institutions and benefits from
high political and social stability. The
country has some of the highest social and
competitiveness indicators in the region and
enjoys investment-grade rating on its
sovereign bonds. Its low crime level, welleducated work force, reliable infrastructure,
and attractive natural setting have helped
make it a leading destination for high-end
tourism and a prime location for offshore
financial services.

2.
The global recession is severely affecting the Barbadian economy. After barely
growing (0.2 percent) in 2008, real GDP is estimated to have declined by 3 percent (y/y) in
the first half of 2009 (Figure 1). Similar to its Caribbean neighbors, stay-over tourist arrivals
in Barbados fell thus far in 2009 by 8½ percent (Figure 2), tourism receipts dropped by more
than 11 percent, and construction declined by 4½ percent, affected by cancelled or delayed
tourism-related projects. The unemployment rate rose from 7.9 percent in 2008Q1 to
10.1 percent in 2009Q1, its highest level since 2003. A recovery in tourism will likely have
to wait for a resumption in employment growth in advanced countries. Accordingly, output is
expected to contract by 3 percent in 2009 and to remain virtually flat in 2010, while the
unemployment rate is likely to increase further.
3.
Balance of payments pressures have increased, despite a narrowing in the
current account deficit. The external current account deficit is projected to narrow from
10½ percent in 2008 to 5¼ percent of GDP in 2009, reflecting a sharp contraction in imports.
In the first semester of 2009, a reversal of private capital flows led to net capital outflows.
Thus, despite a 30 percent fall in imports, international reserves declined by about
US$50 million, after a drop of almost US$100 million in 2008. In the second half of 2009,
foreign reserves will be boosted by the SDR allocations (around US$90 million) and the
successful placement in August of a US$120 million government bond abroad.
4.
Based on current policies, in FY 2009/10, the non-financial public sector (NFPS)
deficit would widen to 8½ percent, with public debt rising to 115 percent of GDP by
year-end. Reflecting a steady relaxation of the fiscal stance in recent years, the overall
balance of the nonfinancial sector shifted from a small surplus in FY 2004/05 (April to
March) to a deficit of 7½ percent of GDP in FY 2008/09. In the first quarter of this fiscal
year, tax collections declined by 9.3 percent year-on-year. In June, Standard and Poor’s
downgraded Barbados’s foreign currency rating from BBB+ to BBB, with stable outlook,
citing the country’s high debt, weak outlook, and difficult fiscal challenges.
5.
As part of the FY 2009/10 budget, the government announced a number of
countercyclical fiscal measures. These included: (i) public loans, grants, and guarantees to
encourage the renovation of tourism-related facilities; (ii) new public capital projects; and
(iii) an employment stabilization scheme under which employers would be allowed to defer

4
for one year their contribution to the National Insurance Scheme (NIS). At the same time, the
government took important steps to place public enterprises on a more solid footing. In
October 2008, it introduced a new pricing mechanism for domestic fuel prices, to bring them
in line with international prices and, in July 2009, raised utility rates for water and
wastewater services by an average of 60 percent—the first such rate increase in 20 years.
6.
At end-March 2009, twelve-month broad money growth was flat. Although yearon-year credit growth remains positive (7½ percent in April) it has decelerated sharply in
recent months. Twelve-month inflation, which had peaked at 11.2 percent (y/y) in September
2008, fell to 3.8 percent in April 2009, and is projected at 3–4 percent by year-end. With
declining inflation pressures, the Central Bank of Barbados (CBB) has eased monetary
conditions, gradually lowering the minimum deposit rate from 5¼ percent in November 2007
to 2½ percent in August 2009. In early July, it also reduced the reserve requirement on
foreign currency deposits from 6 percent to 4 percent.

Estimates of the equilibrium real effective exchange rate suggest that, as at end2008, the actual rate was close to equilibrium (Box 1). Nevertheless, there remain
significant downside risks to external sustainability, in particular, related to the large fiscal
imbalances. On current policies, the external current account deficit is projected at about
5½ percent of GDP over the medium term. However, FDI inflows, which have traditionally
financed a significant part of the deficit, would remain subdued. In the absence of corrective
measures, reserves are projected to decline to close to two months of imports over the
medium term, which could lead to pressures on the currency peg.

Box 1. Barbados: Exchange Rate Assessment
Barbados’s exchange rate peg has been a very effective nominal anchor. It has provided a long
period of nominal exchange rate and price stability, which have had positive effects on investment
and growth.

Barbados' Share in Caribbean Tourism

Indicators do not point to a competitiveness
problem. Tourism receipts displayed robust doubledigit growth rates and increased market share during
2005–07, i.e., until the cyclical decline in 2008,
which largely reflects a collapse in external demand.
Similarly, the country’s placement on the OECD’s
“White List” for international tax jurisdictions (the
only such country in the Caribbean) also bodes well
for sustained offshore business activity.

relies on a panel regression of actual exchange rates
on a set of fundamentals, using a sample of tourism-dependent countries in the Caribbean. Barbados’s
actual exchange rate is almost identical to its estimated equilibrium level, as at end-2008.
Nevertheless, there are some downside risks to external sustainability, in particular, related to the
large fiscal deficits and the consequent pressure on aggregate demand. In the absence of corrective
measures, over the medium term, the external current account deficit is projected at around 5–
6 percent of GDP and international reserves would decline to close to two months of imports,
reflecting reduced access to foreign financing.

II. RISKS TO THE OUTLOOK
8.
At this stage, risks to the economic outlook are mainly tilted to the downside,
arising largely from a protracted recession or anemic recovery in advanced economies.
In addition, there is a risk that, at least in the near term, FDI and other private capital inflows
to the Caribbean region will not recover to pre-crisis levels. 1 This would prolong the
country’s recession and increase pressures on international reserves and the public finances.
Moreover, the outlook for the offshore financial sector may be uncertain, particularly if
significant changes were to be introduced in the Canadian and U.S. tax regulations governing
their companies’ overseas operations (Box 2). Sharper-than-projected increases in world oil
prices could also place the BOP under strain and reignite inflation pressures. The country’s
commitment to the fixed exchange rate—both to the regime and to the nominal level vis-àvis the U.S. dollar puts all the burden of adjustment on contractionary domestic policies.
9.
There are also important fiscal financing risks. While there appears to be sufficient
financing available for the current fiscal year, the outlook for FY 2010/11 and beyond is less
certain. There is a risk that, in the context of lower capital inflows, the borrowing
requirements of the public sector could crowd out credit to the private sector or lead to
reliance on central bank financing. There is also a heightened risk that some public sector
entities may no longer be able to service government-guaranteed loans, thus forcing the
government to assume and service those loans. Finally, the still uncertain fate of CLICOBarbados (see below) might entail additional budgetary costs not yet reflected in the current
fiscal projections.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Fiscal Policy
10.
The mission encouraged the authorities to aim for a lower fiscal deficit in
FY 2009/10. Given uncertainties about the strength of the global recovery and the
normalization of capital flows, the mission cautioned the authorities that large fiscal deficits
and declining reserves could result in a sudden and sharp deterioration in investor
confidence. Early fiscal action was therefore needed to reduce fiscal financing risks, support
the balance of payments, and begin the process of medium-term fiscal consolidation. To this
end, it recommended that the authorities seek expenditure savings of about 1 percent of GDP
in FY 2009/10, in an effort to keep the overall deficit at around the same level as last year.
11.
The authorities did not favor further tightening the fiscal stance at this stage.
They noted that their commitment to fiscal prudence was evidenced by the recent tariff
adjustment for utilities and expressed concern that fiscal contraction, at a time of declining
output, would choke the economy and further weaken confidence. They maintained that their
strategy would center on seeking external funding, principally from multilateral institutions,

The baseline projections assume a modest recovery in private capital flows, beginning in the second half of
2009, based on an early resumption of some hotel construction projects.

Box 2. Barbados: Outlook for the Offshore Financial Sector
The global financial crisis has significantly depressed revenues and profits in Barbados’s
offshore financial sector, leading to lower corporate tax collections. Even as signs of a
global economic recovery emerge, the outlook for the sector is clouded by downside risks
stemming from regulatory actions in source markets and increased competition from other
offshore centers.
The international business sector is a major contributor to the economy of Barbados.
The sector accounts for about two-thirds of corporate tax revenues, employs over 3,500
people, mostly in high-skill jobs, and serves as a magnet for tourism, foreign exchange, and
technical know-how. Canada and the United States, with whom Barbados has double taxation
avoidance treaties (DTATs), are the most important source markets for activity in the sector.
The current financial crisis has led to a
decrease in overall activity in the sector. In
recent months, offshore companies have
experienced a steep fall in revenues and profits.
Although businesses in the sector differ in size
and activity, their close linkages to financial
institutions and markets in advanced economies
have made them susceptible to the global
financial crisis.

The offshore sector could be adversely affected by changes in U.S. and Canadian tax
policy and regulations. Following the report of the Advisory Panel on Canada’s System of
International Taxation in December 2008, Canada has begun a process of entering into a
number of new DTATs, including with some of Barbados’s competitors in the region. This
would eliminate or at least reduce certain tax advantages that Canadian companies enjoy in
Barbados. Also, the United States has proposed new regulations that would limit tax
arbitrage opportunities that Barbados offers to U.S. companies.
The authorities should quickly adapt to any changes in international tax regulations.
Notwithstanding uncertainties, a sudden downward shift to the business outlook is possible,
if certain aspects of the U.S. proposals become law, or if Europe introduces similar curbs on
international taxation. That said, Barbados’s reputation as a well-managed and developed
jurisdiction with a highly educated workforce, together with its placement on the OECD
“white list”, puts it in a strong position vis-à-vis its competitors.1/
____________________________________

On April 2, 2009, the OECD published a scorecard of jurisdictions and their progress towards implementing internationally agreed tax
standard. Barbados was placed on the “white list,” leaving centers such as Switzerland, Singapore, and Luxemburg on the “grey list”. Since
then, many jurisdictions have signed tax information exchange agreements with other members and have graduated to the “white list.”

to cover the financing needs in the near term, while preparing to implement a strong fiscal
adjustment program in the period ahead.
12.
Some uncertainty persists with respect to the financing of the fiscal deficit next
year. The mission supported the government’s efforts to intensify its engagement with
multilateral institutions. It agreed that accessing liquidity support facilities and policy-based
lending from multilaterals could provide an important buffer against external shocks in the
current global environment. It also recommended expediting administrative procedures in
order to ensure the rapid disbursement of existing project loans. 2 It encouraged the
authorities to save the proceeds from the US$120 million foreign bond, with a view to prefinancing a large amortization payment (US$100 million) due in June 2010. The mission also
cautioned the authorities that, absent a significant reduction in the deficit, its financing could
be a challenge for next fiscal year and beyond.
13.
The mission noted that there was a risk that, under current policies, public debt
would gradually grow to unsustainable levels (Appendix 1). It recommended that the
authorities articulate, as soon as possible, a

14.
The authorities emphasized their commitment to substantially reduce the fiscal
deficit over the medium term and broadly agreed with these measures. They agreed that
a credible medium-term fiscal consolidation strategy was needed and indicated that they had
begun its preparation, including with plans for a comprehensive tax reform, which would be
designed with support from CARTAC. To reduce spending, the authorities are contemplating
a reduction in implicit subsidies for natural gas deliveries and negotiated wage settlements. In
this context, the mission noted that Barbados’s social partnership—a tripartite framework of
high-level consultation between government, business, and trade unions—has proven to be a
reliable institutional structure to reach social consensus, particularly on tough policy choices.
2

In a number of cases, the government had completed and fully paid expenses associated with foreign-financed
projects, but not yet completed administrative requirements for reimbursement.

9
B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
15.
The mission cautioned that further monetary policy easing would need to be
consistent with maintaining an adequate level of reserves. It pointed out that, at
2½ percent, the minimum deposit rate remains negative in real terms. Given the decline in
international reserves and the authorities’ commitment to the exchange rate peg, the scope for
further easing appears very limited. The mission recognized that existing capital controls
provided the country with some protection against disruptive and volatile capital flows
(Box 3). However, it noted that capital flows had turned negative during the first half of 2009
and advised the authorities to monitor developments carefully before adopting any further
monetary accommodation.
16.
The authorities indicated that recent cuts in the minimum deposit rate were
consistent with protecting foreign reserves. They noted that interest rates in Barbados
remained higher than in industrialized countries and explained that their actions were not
aimed at stimulating bank credit but at alleviating interest costs to borrowers. They expected
that the cuts would reduce the risks of credit default, at a time when businesses were
suffering from lower earnings.
17.
The authorities reaffirmed their strong commitment to the current exchange
rate peg. The fixed peg to the U.S. dollar has been an effective nominal anchor since its
establishment in 1975, providing price stability with a positive effect on investment and
growth. Staff noted that various indicators suggest that the exchange rate is close to its
equilibrium level. However, current global shocks have put strains on the country’s
economy. Staff noted that there is a risk that pressures on the currency could emerge if
private capital inflows were to remain weak, while public debt continued to rise in the
context of persistent large fiscal deficit. Staff also noted that, over the medium term, possible
changes in tax regulations abroad could adversely affect Barbados’s offshore financial sector,
which has been an important source of foreign exchange in the past decade.
C. Financial Sector Policies

Barbados’s banks, which are predominantly Canadian owned, appear well

Box 3. Barbados: Capital Controls
The Central Bank of Barbados (CBB) maintains restrictions on capital flows, although these have
been implemented liberally. The goal is to protect monetary and financial stability, strengthen the
effectiveness of monetary policy, and manage pressures on the peg. In the mid-1990s, however, in
line with Barbados’s commitments under the CARICOM Single Market and Economy, some controls
were lifted. These included granting commercial banks the authority to approve a number of capital
transactions, which had previously required prior approval by the CBB. Approval by the CBB is,
however, still required for a range of non-CARICOM capital account transactions, including the
following:


Direct investment. The CBB maintains controls on both inward and outward (non-CARICOM)
investments but has delegated authority to commercial banks to approve the liquidation of
unlisted equity investments in Barbados up to the amount registered with the CBB.



Real estate. The CBB maintains controls on purchases of real estate abroad by residents, and
purchases of real estate in Barbados by nonresidents. In September 2007, the authorities relaxed
restrictions on remittance of the proceeds from the sale of real estate in Barbados involving
transactions between two or more nonresidents and settled through their respective accounts
abroad.



Capital and money market instruments. Transactions involving the sale and purchase of nonCARICOM securities by residents require CBB approval. Earnings on securities and other money
market instruments purchased abroad by residents must be surrendered to commercial banks.



Financial sector provisions. Commercial banks require CBB approval to borrow abroad to
finance their domestic operations and are required to surrender 25 percent of their foreign
currency borrowings to the CBB.

system, and the authorities concurred. The mission advised the authorities to pause with the
implementation of certain Basel II standards, particularly as they relate to self regulation by
commercial banks. It commended the authorities for moving ahead with the implementation
of the 2008 FSAP Update recommendations. These steps include new legislation to
strengthen regulations on large bank exposures, loan classification, provisioning, and lending
to related parties, which the authorities expect to be approved by early 2010.
19.
The mission welcomed moves for closer regional cooperation in bank
supervision. Given the integration of the region’s financial system, the mission welcomed
the signing of various memoranda of understanding, and strengthened cooperation with the
Canadian and Trinidadian supervisors on cross-border activities of bank conglomerates.
20.
The mission encouraged the authorities to continue efforts to improve the
regulatory and supervisory framework of the nonbank financial sector. It stressed the
importance, in the context of the planned establishment of the Financial Services
Commission next year, of taking steps to strengthen its technical capacity. The authorities

11
agreed, and to this end, have requested technical assistance from CARTAC to assess and
improve the effectiveness of insurance supervision.
21.
Decisive action will be needed to resolve the problems of CLICO-Barbados and
prevent large losses to the public finances. The government has taken steps to address the
contagion problems affecting CLICO-Barbados and its subsidiaries from its Trinidadian
parent company, Colonial Life Financial. In particular, earlier this year, the central bank
deposited US$5 million into CLICO-Barbados’s mortgage subsidiary, and gave it access to a
special credit window. At the same time, the government is trying to facilitate an orderly
takeover of CLICO-Barbados and its subsidiaries by other viable financial entities, without
recourse to public funds. The issues involved are complex, due to some illiquid assets and a
significant shortfall (about 3 percent of GDP) in the statutory fund of the life-insurance
subsidiary. In this context, the mission encouraged the authorities to develop contingency
plans that could be quickly implemented in the event that the current approach is
unsuccessful, to mitigate the potential impact on the already high public debt, on financial
sector soundness and on investor confidence. The authorities expressed confidence that their
efforts would result in a positive outcome and explained that a number of local entities had
already entered firm bids to acquire one of CLICO-Barbados subsidiaries.
D. Statistical Issues
22.
The mission welcomed the completion of a CARTAC-sponsored technical study
aimed at improving the coverage, and revising the series, of current GDP. This study
implies that 2007 nominal GDP was underestimated by about 15 percent, mainly due to
under-coverage of the financial and tourism sectors. While the timing has yet to be
determined, the mission recommended that the authorities publish the revised data as soon as
possible, as the corrected nominal GDP data would have important implications for a number
of macroeconomic indicators. It also encouraged the authorities to seek additional technical
assistance in order to revise GDP series at constant prices, which still rely on the economic
structure of 1974 as a base year.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
23.
Barbados is facing a severe economic recession. Output is contracting, as the global
financial crisis has depressed tourism, brought FDI to a sudden stop, and weakened public
finances. Consequently, unemployment has risen to double-digit level, and international
reserves have declined. While the underlying balance of payments is expected to remain
weak, international reserves are expected to increase marginally in 2009, on account of the
SDR allocations and the large government bond issue abroad.
24.
The authorities are committed to maintaining the fixed exchange-rate peg. The
longstanding peg to the U.S. dollar has been an effective nominal anchor, providing price
stability with a positive effect on investment and growth. While various indicators suggest
that the actual exchange rate is close to its equilibrium level, the current global shocks have
put strains on the country’s economy. In addition, possible changes in tax regulations abroad

12
could adversely affect Barbados’s offshore financial sector, which is an important source of
foreign exchange.
25.
The authorities are encouraged to develop a credible medium-term fiscal
adjustment plan and start with its implementation, as soon as possible. If left unchecked,
the large fiscal deficits, combined with an uncertain foreign financing outlook, could result in
a sudden and sharp deterioration in investor confidence. A concerted adjustment effort is,
therefore, crucial to countering such a risk, by reducing fiscal financing needs, supporting the
balance of payments, and placing public debt on a firm downward path. This would also
enhance growth, including by enhancing confidence and attracting higher investment. To this
end, the authorities will need to commit early on to decisive fiscal measures, particularly in
the area of expenditure restraint. It will also be important to develop contingency plans, in
the event that the economic recovery is delayed and fiscal pressures persist. Barbados is,
however, well placed to take such bold action, given its established social partnership that
has a proven track record of reaching social consensus, particularly at difficult times.
26.
Monetary policy should be geared to ensuring price stability and protecting
foreign reserves. The existing capital controls give the country some protection against
disruptive and volatile capital movements, thereby providing the authorities some room to
independently set interest rates. Given the recent decline in foreign reserves, the authorities
are encouraged, in the context of their strong commitment to the peg, to monitor
developments closely before easing monetary policy further.
27.
Barbados’s banks appear to be well capitalized. Prudential indicators remain
favorable, and the mission advised the authorities to carefully monitor the incipient rise in
nonperforming loans, although they were still at a relatively low level. On banking
supervision, the authorities should review the implementation of certain Basel II standards,
particularly regarding the self regulation by commercial banks. The authorities are
commended for moving ahead with implementing the recommendations of the 2008 FSAP
Update. Quick and decisive action should be taken to resolve the problems of CLICOBarbados and prevent large losses to the public finances. There is also a need to develop
contingency plans, should the current approach of selling CLICO-Barbados’s subsidiaries to
private investors prove unsuccessful, to mitigate the impact on the public finances, and
protect the financial system and investor confidence.
28.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

APPENDIX I. ILLUSTRATIVE SCENARIOS AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSES (DSAS)

The staff conducted debt sustainability analyses, based on two scenarios for the
medium-term outlook: (i) a baseline “passive” scenario that assumed current policies would
be broadly maintained for the foreseeable future; and (ii) an adjustment “active” scenario that
assumed that a number of corrective measures—mainly in the fiscal sector—would be
implemented beginning in FY 2009/10 (April to March).
A. Key Assumptions and Scenarios
A number of assumptions are common to both the baseline and adjustment scenarios.
These include the same price developments, a stable exchange rate peg, and a recovery in the
global demand for Barbados’s goods and services, starting in 2010. Both scenarios also
assume that no new large private-public-partnerships projects will be undertaken, and there
will be no costs to the budget arising from the resolution of the problems of CLICOBarbados. On the external side, both scenarios assume the special and general
SDR allocations totaling US$88 million will be approved and will come into effect in the
second half of 2009. Likewise, it is assumed that some private capital inflows will resume in
the second half of 2009 to finance a number of stalled tourism projects.
Baseline scenario
The baseline scenario is premised on an unchanged fiscal policy stance. The nonfinancial
public sector (NFPS) deficit would rise from 7½ percent of GDP in FY 2008/09 to
8½ percent of GDP in FY 2009/10. While the overall balance would improve as the country
emerges from recession, the NFPS deficit would remain at around 5 percent over the medium
term. As a result, gross public debt would rise along an upward trajectory from 106 percent
of GDP at end-FY 2008/09 to more than 130 percent of GDP by the end of FY 2014/15. At
the same time, the current account deficit would remain at about 5–6 percent of GDP. Capital
will continue to flow into the country at a weak pace, and it will be insufficient to cover the
current account deficit. Accordingly, reserves would decline from currently about 3.3 months
of imports to 2.2 months of imports at end-FY 2014.
Adjustment scenario
In the adjustment scenario, it is assumed that the authorities will tighten fiscal policies
in the context of a medium-term fiscal consolidation plan. This will start with a modest
effort of 1 percent of GDP in FY 2009/10. While some small improvements are projected in
revenue collections, the bulk of the fiscal efforts would take place in moderating and
prioritizing expenditures. The improved fiscal outlook would result in the NFPS moving

22
from a deficit of 7½ of GDP on FY 2008/09 to a surplus of 140
Total Public Debt
3½ percent of GDP in FY 2014/15, and gross debt, after
(In Percent of GDP)
130
peaking in FY 2010/11 at close to 119 percent of GDP,
would steadily decline along a downward path to
120
103 percent of GDP by the end of the projection period.
110
Real GDP would contract moderately in 2009, reflecting
the demand withdrawal from expenditure savings in
100
FY 2009/10, but subsequently rebound quicker and remain
90
higher, as investor confidence in the government’s
adjustment policies recovers and private capital inflows
80
2006/07
2008/09
2010/11
resume at a healthier pace, with higher FDI, particularly in
the tourism and offshore financial sectors. The higher growth
in the outer years would also contribute to improved debt
dynamics, as would lower spreads on government debt.
1000

The fiscal consolidation effort will also improve the
balance of payments outlook. As investor confidence
strengthens, current and capital inflows in general, and FDI
in particular, will rebound. As a result, the current account
deficit will narrow, compared to the baseline scenario.
International reserves, rather than trending downward, will
broadly stabilize during 2010–11, and then rise steadily to
reach about US$970 million, or 4.5 months of imports, by
the end of the projection period.

B. Assessment of DSAs
Baseline scenario
Bounds tests reveal that the path of debt could be affected considerably in response to
standard shocks. Public debt under the baseline scenario, as discussed above, will increase
continuously over the projection period to 131 percent of GDP. Debt ratios are particularly
sensitive to a growth and fiscal shocks. Should economic growth decline on a permanent
basis by ½ standard deviation from its historic trend, public debt at the end of the projection
period would rise to 146 percent of GDP. In the same way, if the primary balance were to
continue in line with its historic trend, public debt would reach 150 percent of GDP at the
end of the projection period.
External debt is less sensitive to standard shocks. This is mainly on account of the
relatively low share of external debt relative to total debt (less than one-third). Total private
and public external debt is estimated at about 47 percent of GDP at end-2008, and after
peaking in 2009, is likely to fall under the baseline scenario to about 40 percent of GDP by
the end of the projection period. However, as can be expected, external debt is most sensitive
to a real depreciation shock. Accordingly, an illustrative depreciation of 30 percent would
raise the external debt to 56 percent of GDP by the end of the projection period. Another
perspective is to estimate the potential shock arising from an increase in the price of oil by
30 percent above current WEO projections, starting in 2010. This would widen the current
account deficit by 2 percent of GDP, and could lead, everything else left unchanged, to a
depletion of reserves by 2014.
Adjustment scenario
Under the active scenario, rather than climbing steadily, public debt will peak in
FY 2010/11 and then trend downward. The public debt outlook improves considerably,
thanks to positive and sustained fiscal balances, higher overall growth, and lower interest
rates and payments. Bound tests also reveal a much-reduced vulnerability to the standard
stresses, suggesting that public debt would continue to fall even after these shocks hit the
economy. A similar improvement is also evident in stress tests to the external debt outlook.

1/ Indicate coverage of public sector, e.g., general government or nonfinancial public sector. Also whether net or gross debt is used.
2/ Derived as [(r - (1+g - g + (1+r]/(1+g++g)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate;  = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;  = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and  = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as (1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

APPENDIX II. BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF APPENDICES

Discussion. The 2009 Article IV consultation discussions were held in Barbados during
July 10–17, 2009. The staff team comprised Trevor Alleyne (head), Gamal El-Masry, Usman
Khosa, and Carla Macario (all WHD). Michael Horgan (Executive Director) and Pierre
St-Amant (OED, Senior Advisor) participated in the concluding discussions. The team met
with Prime Minister David Thompson; Minister of State (Finance) Senator Darcy Boyce;
Central Bank Governor Dr. Marion Williams; other senior government officials; and
representatives of the private sector and labor.
Exchange-rate arrangements Barbados accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3,
and 4 on November 3, 1993, and there are no restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers for current international transactions. The Barbados dollar has been pegged to the
U.S. dollar since mid-1975 at BDS$2.00 = US$1.00.
Fund relations.
 Financial assistance. Barbados has no outstanding purchases and loans with the Fund. The
last financial arrangement was a Stand-by Arrangement for the period 02/07/1992 to
05/31/1993 totaling SDR 23.9 million, of which SDR 14.7 million was drawn.


Recent technical assistance:
 CARTAC in July 2009 completed a three-year project of assisting the Barbados Statistics
Services in improving the coverage, and revising the series, of current GDP data.
 In July 2009, CARTAC and the IMF’s Statistics Department conducted a workshop in
Barbados on improving the coverage of government finance statistics.
 In February 2009, a mission from the IMF’s Statistics Department visited Barbados on
monetary and financial statistics.

Relations with the World Bank Group. The World Bank just recently concluded an HIV/AIDS
awareness and prevention project. A successor project, totaling US$35 million, which became
effective in 2009, is supporting the implementation of the 2008–2013 Barbados National
HIV/AIDS Strategic Plan. More recently, the World Bank is also exploring whether it can
resume policy-based lending to Barbados.
Relations with the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB). The IADB’s Country Strategy
with Barbados for the period 2005–08 focused on public sector reforms and improving
competitiveness. The IADB is in the process of preparing a new successor Country Strategy
with Barbados. The IADB’s current Barbados portfolio totals US$137 million, comprising
US$3 million in technical assistance grants and US$134 million in investment loans.

Relations with the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB). Since 1970, the CDB has
provided Barbados with loans and grants totaling US$276 million in support of the
productive sectors, economic infrastructure, health, and education. In 2008, the CBD
disbursed loans amounting to US$25.2 million to Barbados. Disbursements during the first
five months of 2009 amounted to US$4 million.

The Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) has approved loans amounting to US$400
million over the years of which US$340 million have been disbursed, and with an undisbursed
balance of US$77 million. Net cash flow to Barbados has been negative since 2003 as a result of
a slow-down in execution but a positive flow is projected in 2009.

APPENDIX IV. BARBADOS—RELATIONS WITH CARIBBEAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
As of May 31, 2009
The Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) approved US$276.1 million (net) in loans, contingent
loans, equity and grants to Barbados between 1970 and 2008. This represents 8.4 percent of total
approvals to CDB’s borrowing member countries.
Of the total funds approved US$78.7 million or 28.5 percent were allocated to the productive
sectors which comprise agriculture, manufacturing, tourism, and mining. Approximately
US$45.5 million or 16.5 percent of the total was allocated to the manufacturing sector, while
tourism accounted forUS$28.9 million, or 10.0 percent.
Economic infrastructure accounted for US$143.8 million or 52.1 percent of approved funds. Of
these funds, US$88.1 million (31.9 percent) were allocated to the transportation,
US$50.2 million (18.2 percent) to the education, and US$3.2 million (1.2 percent) to the health
sectors.

APPENDIX V. BARBADOS—STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
While data provision has some shortcomings, it is broadly adequate for surveillance
purposes. Barbados participates in the General Data Dissemination System, with metadata and
the authorities’ plans for improving the statistical base posted on the Fund’s Dissemination
Standards Bulletin Board.
Real Sector
2.
The Barbados Statistical Services compiles national accounts statistics according to the
1968 SNA manual. A lack of current, reliable source data on nonsugar agriculture, private
construction, and nontourism service activities affects production-based GDP estimates. To
address some of the weaknesses in this area the authorities initiated a census of economic
activity in June 2005. The census covered tourism, financial businesses, and transport and
communications. Expenditure-based GDP estimates are derived from selected surveys; the
household survey yields a reliable estimate of aggregate consumption, but the external trade and
investment surveys suffer from certain weaknesses. Constant price GDP estimates, compiled by
the Central Bank of Barbados (CBB), have an outdated 1974 base year; the authorities are
currently updating the base year to 2000 in order to facilitate comparison within the Caribbean
Community area. The authorities, with the assistance of CARTAC, recently completed a revision
of the national accounts data, which revealed that current GDP over the past two decades was
underestimated by 7-20 percent. Thus, these data shortcomings add some uncertainty to the GDP
analyses and projections, as presented in the staff report.
3.
Despite recent initiatives to update the consumer price index and the index of industrial
production, potential misalignments in real estate prices are not addressed due to the absence of a
systematic index of property prices. The consumer price index uses an expenditure basket for
1998–99 for its July 2001=100 series introduced in January 2002. The index of industrial
production is based on the sectoral weights from 1982; the authorities are currently working
towards rebasing the series to 1994. Since these outdated base years do not necessarily reflect the
current structure of consumption and production, they possibly distort the derived price data.
Government finance statistics
4.
Fairly comprehensive and up-to-date above-the-line data are available for the general
government, but there is a lag in the reporting of transfers. As a result of the incomplete coverage
of off-budget transactions, a discrepancy exists between the overall balance and financing data.
Public enterprise data are not systematically and promptly reported to the Ministry of Finance,
Investment, Telecommunications and Energy. Financial sector data on public sector net domestic
borrowing usually cannot be fully reconciled with above-the-line fiscal data, partly because of
limited availability of nonbank financial sector information. This reduces the degree of certainty
about the actual fiscal position. The authorities introduced accrual accounting of public finance
in April 2007.

10

Monetary and financial statistics
5.
While some weaknesses remain with respect to the overall quality, coverage, and
timeliness of the monetary and financial statistics, they do not hinder Fund surveillance. The
2007 and 2008 STA missions found that the quality of monetary and financial statistics was
compromised by various methodological problems, misclassifications, and the inconsistent
application of residency criterion. The technical assistance missions recommended correcting a
number of misclassifications of accounting data and assisted the CBB in compiling the
standardized report forms (SRFs). The CBB has recently started compiling monetary statistics
based on the SFRs, which include comprehensive detailed depository corporations’ data.
External sector statistics
6.
Lags in the compilation of merchandise trade data, and infrequent and incomplete
information on the activities of the offshore sector, limit the timeliness of the external current
account balance estimates. Estimates of the components of the external financial account need to
be improved, including data on the net international investment position.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
September 14, 2009

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2009 Article IV Consultation
with Barbados
On September 10, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Barbados. 1
Background
Barbados benefits from well-functioning institutions and social and political stability. The
country has some of the highest social and competitiveness indicators in the region and
enjoys investment-grade rating on its sovereign debt. Its low crime rate, well-educated
work force, and attractive natural setting have helped make it a top destination for highend tourism and a prime location for offshore financial services and real estate
investment. While the long-standing peg to the U.S. dollar has provided a positive effect
on investment and growth, some vulnerabilities arise from the high level of public debt
and continued fiscal imbalances.
The global recession is severely affecting the Barbadian economy. After barely growing
in 2008, real GDP is expected to contract by 3 percent in 2009 and to remain virtually
flat next year, on account of weak performances in the tourism and construction sectors.
After peaking at 11.2 percent in September 2008, twelve-month inflation is projected to
decline to 3–4 percent by end-2009. The external current account deficit would narrow
from 10½ percent of GDP in 2008 to 5¼ percent in 2009, and remain below 6 percent in
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities.

2
2010. International reserves, which declined by almost US$100 million in 2008, are
likely to broadly stabilize during 2009, boosted by the recent placement abroad of a
US$120 million government bond and by SDR allocations of around US$90 million.
Reflecting a steady relaxation of fiscal policies, the nonfinancial public sector balance
shifted from a small surplus in FY 2004/05 (April to March) to a deficit of 7½ percent of
GDP in FY 2008/09. Based on current policies, it is likely to widen to 8½ percent of GDP
this fiscal year, raising the public debt ratio to 115 percent of GDP by year-end.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that Barbados is facing a severe economic recession. Output
is contracting, as the global financial crisis has depressed tourism, brought Foreign
Direct Investment (FDI) to a sudden stop, and weakened public finances. Consequently,
unemployment has risen to double-digit level. While the underlying balance of payments
is expected to remain weak, international reserves are expected to increase marginally
in 2009, on account of the SDR allocations and the large government bond issue
abroad.
Directors took note of the authorities’ commitment to maintaining the fixed exchangerate peg. The longstanding peg to the U.S. dollar has been an effective nominal anchor,
providing price stability with a positive effect on investment and growth. While various
indicators suggest that the actual exchange rate is close to its equilibrium level,
Directors observed that the current global shocks have put strains on the country’s
economy. In addition, possible changes in tax regulations abroad could adversely affect
Barbados’s offshore financial sector, which is an important source of foreign exchange.
Directors encouraged the authorities to develop a credible medium-term fiscal
adjustment plan and start with its implementation, as soon as possible. They were of the
view that, if left unchecked, the large fiscal deficits, combined with an uncertain foreign
financing outlook, could result in a deterioration in investor confidence. A concerted
adjustment effort was, therefore, crucial to countering such a risk, by reducing fiscal
financing needs, supporting the balance of payments, and placing public debt on a firm
downward path. This would also enhance growth, including by strengthening confidence
and attracting higher investment. To this end, Directors encouraged the authorities to
commit early on to decisive fiscal measures, particularly in the area of expenditure
restraint. They considered that it would also be important to develop contingency plans,
in the event that the economic recovery was delayed and fiscal pressures persisted.
Directors, however, underscored that Barbados was well placed to take such bold
action, given its established social partnership with a proven track record of reaching
social consensus, particularly at difficult times.
Directors noted that monetary policy should be geared to ensuring price stability and
protecting foreign reserves. They observed that existing capital controls gave the
country some protection against disruptive and volatile capital movements, thereby

3
providing the authorities some room to independently set interest rates. Given the recent
decline in foreign reserves, Directors encouraged the authorities, in the context of their
strong commitment to the peg, to monitor developments closely before easing monetary
policy further.
Directors considered that Barbados’s banks appeared to be well capitalized. Prudential
indicators remained favorable, and Directors advised the authorities to carefully monitor
the incipient rise in nonperforming loans, although they were still at a relatively low level.
On banking supervision, Directors recommended that the authorities review the
implementation of certain Basel II standards, particularly regarding the self regulation by
commercial banks. They commended the authorities for moving ahead with
implementing the recommendations of the 2008 Financial Sector Assessment Program
Update, adding that quick and decisive action should be taken to resolve the problems
of CLICO-Barbados. Directors also noted that there was a need to develop contingency
plans, should the current approach of selling the subsidiaries of CLICO-Barbados to
private investors prove unsuccessful. This would be important in order to mitigate any
impact on the public finances, and protect the financial system and investor confidence.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat
