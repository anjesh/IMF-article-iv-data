IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with Bhutan
On June 22, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with Bhutan.
Bhutan has made significant economic progress in recent years and the GDP per capita more
than doubled during 2004-2014, rising from $1,108 to $2,612. In the aftermath of the rupee
shortage episode of 2012-13, GDP growth has slowed to below 4 percent in Fiscal Year (FY)
2012/13 and FY2013/14 (July 1 – June 30). Measures to cool down activity contributed to the
slowdown. However, GDP growth is estimated to have picked up to 5.2 percent in FY2014/15
and is projected to reach 6 percent in FY2015/16. Inflation has decelerated rapidly, from 11.3
percent in Q4 2013 to below 3 percent in Q1 2016, though it is projected to return to about 5
percent. Following the slowdown in the wake of the rupee shortage crisis, growth in credit to the
private sector has picked up. The fiscal balance switched from a deficit of 4.2 percent in FY
2012/13 to a surplus of 3.8 percent in FY2013/14, and 1.5 percent of GDP in FY2014/15,
reflecting mainly lower capital spending in the early years of the 11th Five Year Plan (2013/14 –
2017/18). The current account deficit has been approaching record high levels in recent years,
reflecting hydropower investment. These deficits were financed by robust aid inflows, and the
overall balance of payments remained generally positive, allowing further accumulation of
international reserves.
Growth is projected to accelerate further in the coming years, to 6.4 percent in FY2016/17 and to
over 11 percent in FY2017/18, supported by hydropower construction and the commissioning of
new hydropower plants, as well as solid growth in domestic services. The increase in
hydropower generation capacity will boost electricity exports, and as a result, the current account
deficit will decline rapidly, from over 30 percent in FY2016/17 to around 5 percent in
FY2020/21. Reflecting accelerated capital spending in the final years of the 11th Five-Year Plan,
fiscal balance is projected to turn to a moderate deficit in FY2016/17.
Risks are linked mainly to the high public external debt and the need to manage projected large
hydropower-related revenues. If not properly managed, the large pickup in hydropower exports

and the projected increase in export earnings and budget revenues could undermine
macroeconomic stability and the competitiveness of the economy, resulting in overheating and
external imbalances akin to those seen during 2012-13. In addition, Bhutan’s growth could be
adversely affected by a growth slowdown in India triggered by delays in structural reforms. Also,
as illustrated by the slowdown in tourist arrivals in the wake of Nepal’s earthquake, the
Bhutanese tourism industry is susceptible to adverse regional developments.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed the improvement in Bhutan’s macroeconomic performance and
commended the authorities for the significant economic and social gains of recent years.
Directors also considered that the outlook was favorable going forward. However, the current
account deficit and external public debt remain high, mainly reflecting developments in the
hydropower sector. Accordingly, Directors cautioned that while hydropower development brings
opportunities, it also creates macroeconomic challenges that need to be managed carefully to
avoid overheating and imbalances. Moreover, strong efforts are required to increase employment
opportunities, especially for the youth, through enhanced skills and training, and economic
diversification.
Directors noted that the favorable fiscal outcomes in recent years reflected slower-than-projected
implementation of investment projects. They recommended balancing acceleration of capital
spending with maintaining sound fiscal balances and macroeconomic stability. Directors
underscored the need to improve tax revenue collection and limit exemptions, especially given
the expected gradual phasing out of donor assistance and the need for higher social spending.
They welcomed plans to introduce a modern goods and service tax and encouraged the
authorities to ensure timely implementation by 2018.
Directors considered the current monetary policy stance to be broadly appropriate and
commended the authorities for the recent tightening. Directors recommended close monitoring of
liquidity, credit and inflation, and encouraged the authorities to stand ready to adjust monetary
policy as needed. They also recommended further improvement of the liquidity management
system.
Given close economic ties with India, Directors agreed that the exchange rate peg to the Indian
rupee has served Bhutan well and remains an appropriate nominal anchor, even as the ngultrum
is moderately overvalued. They emphasized that macroeconomic stability and improvements in
the business climate and competitiveness are essential to support the peg.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers

Directors welcomed the authorities’ plans to strengthen reserve management. They noted that
while the level of international reserves remains adequate, there is room for improvement in the
composition of reserves to better align it with the structure of external debt and trade flows.
Directors noted the Royal Monetary Authority’s recent efforts to strengthen macroprudential
regulation and supervision and welcomed the introduction of additional tools. They emphasized
the need to fill remaining regulatory gaps, including in the regulation of nonbank financial
institutions.
Directors encouraged elimination of exchange rate restrictions as soon as macroeconomic
conditions allow.

KEY ISSUES
Context. Macroeconomic conditions have improved recently. Growth appears to be
picking up while inflation has declined to low single digits; foreign reserves have been
increasing on the back of a strong financial account; the fiscal balance has recorded a
surplus in the past two years; and credit growth remains moderate. Financial soundness
indicators point to a modest improvement in the health of the financial sector.
Challenges. In the near-term, the main challenge is to maintain stable macroeconomic
conditions as capital spending accelerates in the final years of the current five-year plan.
Looking ahead, the projected increase in hydropower exports needs to be managed
carefully, to avoid overheating and external pressures. A temporary hydropower-related
increase in revenues could create pressures for higher spending.
Main Policy Recommendations.


A large easing of the fiscal stance should be avoided. Given demand conditions,
significant increases in capital spending would provide an unsuitably large fiscal
stimulus, stretch the absorption capacity of the economy, and increase external
pressures.



Tax revenue reform is needed to broaden the tax base, improve revenue collection
and reverse the recent decline in the tax-to-GDP ratio. Existing tax exemptions
should be phased out, and granting of new exemptions should be limited.



The projected spike in hydropower exports and revenues should be managed
carefully, to avoid undermining competitiveness and destabilizing the economy. The
fiscal institutional framework could be strengthened to ensure that a temporary spike
in budget revenues does not lead to a hurried increase in spending.



Credit and liquidity conditions should be closely monitored and hydropower-related
inflows sterilized, to prevent overheating and a resurgence of external pressures.
Additional instruments of liquidity management should be developed, to improve
monetary policy transmission. Reserve composition should be better aligned with the
composition of external debt and trade flows, and reserve management
strengthened. The share of Indian rupee reserves should be increased, and the
reserves invested in safer Indian government securities.

INTRODUCTION
1.
Significant economic and social gains have been realized in Bhutan in recent years. Bhutan
has enjoyed political stability, with national parliamentary elections and a smooth political transition to
the victorious opposition People’s Democratic Party taking place in 2013. Political stability, large donor
assistance, and increased hydropower generation capacity combined to support a more than doubling
of GDP per capita during 2004–2014, rising from $1,108 to $2,612—a significantly faster growth than
that of regional peers.

However, these achievements came with some
important policy challenges. While it brought significant
economic benefits, large hydropower investment and
hydropower-related imports have also presented
significant challenges to macroeconomic management.
This was illustrated during the “rupee shortage crisis” of
2012–13, when large hydropower investment and
hydropower-related imports, together with the boom in
housing lending, led to a sharp widening of the current
account deficit and a shortfall in Indian rupee reserves.

3.
The authorities’ past macroeconomic policies have been broadly in line with staff advice.
The authorities have exercised fiscal restraint by introducing revenue measures and keeping current
expenditures under control, both in accord with the previous staff recommendations. In response to
rapid credit growth, they took steps in 2015 to tighten liquidity, and have removed administrative
credit restrictions. The authorities have also made progress in expanding the toolkit of macroprudential
instruments,

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK AND RISKS
4.
Following a slowdown in activity in the wake of the rupee shortage episode, economic
growth has picked up more recently. From an average of around 8 percent during the Ninth and
Tenth Five-Year Plan (FYP) spanning fiscal years (FY) 2003/04–2012/13, real GDP growth fell to below
4 percent in FY2012/13 and FY2013/14. Measures to dampen the activity contributed to the slowdown.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

However, real GDP growth is estimated to have picked up to 5.2 percent in FY2014/15 and is projected
to reach 6 percent in FY2015/16, driven by a pickup in mining, construction and services.
5.
Inflation has fallen rapidly recently, reaching
a record-low level. After peaking at 11.3 percent in Q4
2013 (y-o-y), consumer price inflation fell to 3.5 percent
at the end of 2015, and further to below 3 percent in
February and March 2016, below India’s 4.8 percent
inflation rate (Box 1). Imported goods inflation has been
falling more rapidly than domestic goods inflation: in
the last twelve months, imported goods inflation fell
from 6.2 percent to 1.8 percent, while domestic goods
inflation eased less, from 6.5 percent to 4.2 percent.

Despite the overall low unemployment rate, some problems in the labor market persist.
Overall unemployment in 2014 was relatively low, at 2.6 percent of the labor force, a modest decline
from 2.9 percent in 2013. Nonetheless, the unemployment problem is serious in some segments of the
labor market. In particular, youth unemployment and urban unemployment are much higher. The
authorities view these problems as worrisome, and are taking active steps to address them through
training and labor market reforms (Box 2).

8.
Private sector credit growth has accelerated
recently, but remains moderate. Following a deceleration in 2012–2014 to below 10 percent, growth
of bank credit to the private sector has picked up in 2015, to about 13–14 percent and around
46 percent of GDP. Credit growth acceleration has been significantly faster in the nonbank sector.
Between end-2013 and end-2015, credit outstanding by nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs) has

outstanding loans. Banks’ liquidity positions
remain solid. The reduction in credit growth also resulted in a lower bank credit-to-deposit ratio, which
fell from 86.4 percent in 2013 to 73 percent in 2014, before increasing to about 80 percent in 2015.

10.
Fiscal performance in recent years has reflected the expenditures dynamics of Bhutan’s
five-year plans. Specifically, capital expenditure tends to ramp over the course of the plan, as projects
get underway. This has been reflected in a deterioration of the fiscal balance as the plan progress. A
surplus of 3.8 percent of GDP was recorded in FY2013/14, the first year of the 11th FYP, compared to the
deficit of 3.7 percent of GDP projected in the original budget. The FY2014/15 (revised) budget
envisaged a deficit of 2.3 percent of GDP, mainly on account of rapid growth in current spending, which

hydropower generation projects will boost
output, exports and fiscal revenues. Growth is projected to accelerate to over 11 percent in FY2017/18
and to around 14 percent in FY2018/19, supported by a tripling of hydropower electricity generation.
The current account deficit is projected to peak at 31.5 percent of GDP in FY2016/17, and then fall
quickly in FY2017/18 and eventually to turn into a surplus. The overall balance is projected to be mostly
positive, supported by hydropower grants and loans.
12.
Risks to the outlook are skewed to the downside. Domestic risks stem from the need to
manage high debt and potentially volatile hydropower-related inflows that may fuel rapid credit
growth and lead to renewed external pressures. External risks result from weaker tourism and the
adverse impact of developments in China on Bhutanese exports. Nepal’s earthquake and regional
security concerns have adversely affected tourism. At the same time, China’s excess capacity in the steel

industry could adversely affect the position of Bhutanese ferroalloy producers exporting to the Indian
market. On the positive side, growth in India remains strong, though reform setbacks could weaken

Policy discussions focused on the appropriate fiscal policy stance in the final years of the 11th Five-Year
Plan and how to boost domestic revenues, on strengthening the monetary policy transmission
mechanism, and how to manage the expected spike in hydropower exports and revenues.

A. Fiscal Policy
Background
13.
For FY2015/16, while the revised budget projected a deficit of 3 percent of GDP, the
outturn is projected to be a surplus of 0.6 percent. While growth in current expenditure has been
tepid, the revised budget assumed an unrealistically high jump in capital spending by over 70 percent,
which is now projected at about 30 percent. The increase in spending is to be financed primarily by
higher GoI grants. In the absence of new revenue measures, domestic revenue growth is projected to
be modest. Even though discussion of the FY2016/17 budget in the Cabinet has not yet been finalized,
the authorities suggested that the budgeted capital spending will likely remain elevated, and if fully
implemented, would result in a deficit of over 5 percent of GDP. Over the medium term, with the
commissioning of new hydropower plants, hydropower-related revenues are projected to increase. At
the same time, donor financing is projected to fall as per capita incomes rise.
14.
The authorities are working towards a major reform of the tax system. With the help of
IMF/World Bank technical assistance, the authorities have launched the project of introducing a
modern goods and services tax (GST) by end-2018. Numerous deficiencies in Bhutan’s tax system have
contributed to a gradual decline of tax revenues. The objective of tax reform is to mitigate these
deficiencies and replace the current sales tax with a simple broad-based GST that would boost
government revenues, while minimizing tax-related distortions and supporting an investment-friendly
environment.
Staff Views
15.
In the near term, fiscal policy should avoid contributing to the reemergence of
overheating pressures and large shifts in the fiscal stance. Staff cautioned against attempts to boost
capital spending excessively in an effort to “catch up” to originally budgeted public investment plans.
Large increases in current spending, including wage increase, should be avoided as well. The recent
increase of pay and allowances of public servants, the resumption of credit growth, and the pickup in
import growth point to a strengthening in domestic demand. At this juncture, a fiscal deficit of around
5 percent of GDP (as under consideration by the authorities) would entail a large fiscal stimulus that
could start undermining macroeconomic stability. Staff cautions against such fiscal loosening, and
recommends targeting a smaller fiscal deficit in the range of 1–2 percent of GDP in FY2016/17. In

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BHUTAN

FY2017/18, with the projected acceleration of economic growth, further strengthening of the fiscal
balance is recommended. Staff recommends targeting a small surplus of around ½ percent of GDP.2
16.
While in recent years the fiscal balance has been stronger than originally targeted,
revenue performance has remained weak and needs to be addressed as a matter of priority. Tax
revenues are projected to fall to 13.2 percent of GDP in FY2015/16 and FY2016/17, down from
15.2 percent of GDP in FY2012/13. As in other countries, the widespread and expanding use of tax
incentives has resulted in a weakening of tax revenue collection. The authorities estimate that tax
exemptions and holidays result in a loss of revenue of up to 2 percent of GDP. Thus, staff recommends
that new tax exemptions should be avoided, expiring exemptions should not be renewed, and existing
exemptions should be phased out. To increase fiscal transparency, listing and costing all tax
expenditures should become an integral part of the budget. The authorities should aim for a simple,
broad-based tax system. In this context, the authorities’ decision to replace the current sales tax with a
simple broad-based GST is welcome. This will increase government revenues while minimizing taxrelated distortions and help create an investment-friendly environment.3
17.
Over the medium-term, the priority should be to place public finances on a more solid
footing, to contain the already-high public debt, and to avoid excessive volatility in the fiscal
stance and emergence of external pressures. On the revenue side, the priority should be the
implementation of a broad-based GST. On the expenditure side, the main objectives should be: (i) keep
current spending growth moderate, in support of debt reduction; and (ii) to ensure that volatility in
revenues and grants does not lead to high spending and fiscal stance volatility. This may require
strengthening the fiscal institutional framework to effectively manage the expected spike in
hydropower-related revenues. The objective should be to avoid hurried spending of temporarily higher
revenues that would pose a risk to both fiscal sustainability and the external position.4 One option—
discussed in the 2011 Article IV Staff Report——would be to introduce a fiscal rule that would constrain
the growth of current spending.5 In addition, a separate account (or stabilization fund) could be created
to temporarily “park” additional hydropower revenues, shield them from pressures to be spent quickly
and less effectively, and avoid the real exchange rate appreciation that would harm competitiveness
and diversification of the economy.
Authorities’ Views
18.
The authorities explained that actual fiscal outcomes are typically stronger than
budgeted. They observed that in the early years of the FYPs, capital spending is usually lagging behind,
as it is a period of carrying out preparatory work for capital investment, and for mobilizing resources,
2

The recommended fiscal balance targets for FY2016/17 and FY2017/18 are derived from a conservative revenue
assumption in the absence of new measures, and the authorities’ spending plans for these years, but smoothed to
avoid large swings in the fiscal balance.

3

Each percentage point increase in the GST is estimated to yield 0.3 percent of GDP in revenues.

4

A projected jump in hydropower-related dividends and profit transfers in FY2018/19 and FY2019/20 with the
commissioning of the three ongoing hydropower projects Puna-I, Puna-II and Mangdechhu will lead to a spike in
nontax revenues.

with donor coordination taking time. As a result, capital spending tends to pick up only in the later
years of the FYP. Thus, capital spending is budgeted to increase significantly in FY2015/16 and
FY2016/17. However, the authorities agreed with the staff’s point that limited absorptive capacity puts a
cap on how much capital spending can be usefully increased, and noted that government agencies do
not usually spend the full budgeted amounts.

revenue collection and increasing reliance on
domestic revenues in covering budgetary spending poses a big challenge. The original target of
financing 85 percent of total spending from domestic revenues at the end of the 11th FYP will not be
met. The authorities noted that domestic revenues have been flat in recent years, and that to increase
tax revenues would require measures to be taken by parliament. They recognized the importance of
introducing the reformed GST, and underscored the need to have it in place before the 2018 elections,
to avoid possible delays.
20.
The authorities agreed that the projected increase in hydropower-related revenues needs
to be managed carefully. They have been discussing the pros and cons of establishing stabilization
fund for some time, but no decision has yet been made. The authorities emphasized the need to avoid
tying their hands too tightly, as Bhutan needs to use the expected hydropower revenues to finance
economic development, given the likely gradual phasing out of external support.

B. Monetary and Financial Sector Policies
Background
21.
The slowdown in credit growth during 2013 and 2014 partly reversed in 2015. After a
period of rapid growth in credit to the private sector averaging 35 percent in 2005–2011, credit growth
fell to below 10 percent in 2013 and 2014.6 However, following the September 2014 termination of the
ban on vehicle and housing loans (introduced during the “rupee shortage crisis”), credit growth picked
up in 2015, though it remained in the 13–14 percent range for most of the year. To sterilize persistent
excess liquidity in the banking system, in March 2015, the Royal Monetary Authority (RMA) increased
the cash reserve ratio (CRR) from 5 to 10 percent—as also recommended by staff during 2014 Article IV

consultation. In the wake of the credit slowdown, financial soundness indicators have improved
modestly.
22.
The RMA is expanding its toolkit
of prudential measures, by increasing its
reliance on macro-prudential regulations.
In 2014, with the support of the Asian
Development Bank (ADB), the RMA outlined
a comprehensive framework for macroprudential policy.7 During 2014–2016, some
macro-prudential regulations such as the
loan to value and loan to income were
implemented, while others — including
counter-cyclical capital buffer and sectoral
capital requirements—are yet to be
operationalized and used.8

should monitor liquidity and stand ready to
promptly respond in case of a resumption of excessive credit growth that would lead to a pickup in
inflation or external pressures. Rupee inflows related to hydropower projects and grants should
continue to be sterilized. At this stage, the RMA needs to rely on CRR and the statutory liquidity ratio
(SLR) as the main available monetary policy instruments.

24.
Looking ahead, RMA’s monetary management should be further strengthened. The CRR
and the SLR are rather blunt instruments, and adding further tools could help improve monetary
transmission. This would require: (i) developing the short-term government securities market, with Tbills at market-determined rates providing a tool for liquidity management (which includes meeting the
These macro-prudential measures included: (i) minimum requirement for leverage ratio; (ii) counter-cyclical capital
buffer; (iii) sectoral capital requirements; (iv) loan-to-value and loan-to-income restrictions; (v) debt-to-equity ratio;
(vi) time varying capital provisioning and margin requirements; and (vii) restrictions on the distribution of profits.

SLR requirements) and an investment alternative; (ii) improving RMA’s ability to forecast liquidity in the
financial sector and the Ministry of Finance’s (MoF) ability to forecast government cash flow;9 (iii)
promoting further development of the interbank lending market as a tool of first resort for banks to
meet their short-term financing needs; (iv) introducing a RMA short-term (overnight) standing facility at
a penalty rate, to complement the interbank markets and RMA’s longer-term RSTLAW facility, and help
the banks meet their short-term liquidity needs; and (v) consider introducing a similar RMA standing
deposit facility, to allow banks to deposit excess liquidity overnight, with penalty (low) rates setting the
floor for interbank deposit rates. In step with these measures, consideration should also be given to
reforming the system of base interest rates (Box 3).
25.
A more developed framework for monetary operations would bring numerous benefits.
Monetary policy transmission would become more effective, as the transition from the policy rate to
interbank rates and government securities rate, and from the interbank rates to bank deposit and
lending rates, would strengthen. Increased supply of government securities would provide financial
institutions a tool for better liquidity management, and an asset for investment. Finally, creating a riskfree benchmark yield curve should help develop an alternative source of corporate funding in corporate
bonds and equity markets. Staff understands that discussions are under way in the working committee
on the publication of the T-bill issuance calendar, and on improving the debt management policy,
including the developments of a long-term domestic debt market, and supports these efforts.
26.
The RMA’s efforts to expand its toolkit of prudential regulation are important. Staff
welcomes the introduction of additional macroprudential tools, including limits on loan-to-value and
loan-to-income ratios. Despite these improvements in prudential regulations, further strengthening of
the RMA’s capacity to detect and prevent development of weaknesses in the financial sector is needed,
in line with the recent IMF technical assistance recommendations. This includes the need to fill the
regulatory gap in the supervision of NBFIs. Currently, the NBFIs are supervised as banks, and some
specific risks, such as insurance risk, are not properly monitored and covered.
27.
The RMA’s steps to strengthen prudential regulation and supervision should put it on
firmer ground to support financial sector development. The mission notes the concerns that parts
of the economy, including small and medium enterprises (SMEs), still lack access to financial services.
The Financial Sector Development Action Plan, prepared with the assistance of the World Bank,
provides a good opportunity to formulate a financial sector development strategy that would properly
balance prudence and development.
Authorities’ Views
28.
The authorities broadly shared staff’s view about monetary conditions and agreed with
the staff’s assessment that further strengthening of the monetary transmission mechanism is
needed. They noted that in view of the ngultrum’s peg to the Indian rupee and close economic and
financial ties to India, they need to closely follow India’s monetary stance. Regarding monetary

transmission, the authorities agreed that the CRR is a blunt instrument, used currently to address both
frictional and structural liquidity problems. They noted that the RMA is already considering the
introduction of short term (overnight) lending and deposit windows, to replace the system of sweeping
overnight balances. However, while the RMA is ready to deploy new monetary policy instruments, for
the successful development of the interbank market, short-term instruments to be used as collateral
are required, including banks’ certificate of deposits and short-term government securities. In addition,
a proper legal framework to regulate the creditor-debtor relationships needs to be developed, so that
both creditors and debtors understand their rights and obligations. The authorities also noted that
there is widespread dissatisfaction with the current system of the base interest rate, and that calls are
growing on the RMA to come up with a fairer system of interest rate setting. In response, the RMA is
envisaging a review of the base rate system, possibly introducing a single base rate.
29.
The authorities expressed concern about insufficient access of certain borrowers to
credit. They are concerned about the lack of credit availability to certain sectors and segments of the
economy. In their view, too much credit goes to finance consumption rather than investment, and some
sectors—in particular micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs)—face difficulties in
accessing credit. Establishing a specialized credit institution is one option under consideration. The
authorities expect that these issues will be addressed in the World Bank’s Financial Sector Development
Action Plan that is currently being finalized.

C. External Sector
Background
30.
The current account deficit remains extremely large, driven by hydropower investment,
but international reserves have been increasing. The current account deficit is estimated to have
approached 29 percent of GDP in FY2014/15, of which about one half was the deficit with India.
Following two years of decline or stagnation, growth of exports and imports (goods) picked up in
FY2014/15, to about 8 percent.10 The current account has been financed by surpluses in capital and
financial accounts. However, the overall balance turned into a small deficit in FY2014/15 and reserves
fell slightly. Subsequently, foreign currency reserves have recovered again in FY2015/16, reaching US$
1,022 million by February 2016, covering about 11 months of imports of goods and services, and
represent about 53 percent of external debt. In the medium-term, with the commissioning of new
hydropower plants, hydropower exports will increase sharply, and the current account deficit is
projected to turn into a surplus.
Staff Views
31.
The current account deficits and external public debt are very high, but reflect Bhutan’s

Hydropower exports represent about one third of total exports, while hydropower related projects and industries

vulnerability. External public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) debt has increased moderately in 2015, to
94.5 percent of GDP, from 93.6 percent of GDP in 2014, and is projected to peak at around 113 percent
of GDP in 2017, before starting to decline. The construction of hydropower projects has led to
increased external debt-to-GDP, and all indicative thresholds of the LIC-DSA are breached in the
baseline (see the Debt Sustainability Analysis Annex). While the extent and length of the breaches
would indicate a high risk of external debt distress, there are unique mitigating factors that point to risk
remaining moderate. As was explained in the 2014 Debt Sustainability Analysis (see 2014 Article IV Staff
Report), explicit guarantees from India that cover financial and construction risks for all hydropower
projects allows for the exceptional treatment of hydropower loans from India similar to that of FDI.11
These unique mitigating circumstances are still in place.
32.
Staff assesses the real effective exchange rate to be moderately overvalued relative to the
level suggested by fundamentals. Using the adjusted external sustainability approach, which takes
into account temporary effects of hydropower related flows, staff assess the ngultrum to be moderately
overvalued (see Box 4). The peg to the Indian rupee continues to remain appropriate and given that
India is Bhutan’s largest trade and development partner, provides Bhutan with a key nominal anchor. To
continue benefitting from the peg, Bhutan needs to avoid loose macroeconomic policies that would be
incompatible with maintaining the peg and that would create the risk of renewed rupee shortages.
33.
Bhutan’s foreign reserves are adequate, but further improvement in their composition is
advisable. All standard measures of reserve adequacy for Bhutan are met by a wide margin (Box 5).
However, when interpreting the reserve metric indicators, it should be kept in mind that Bhutan’s
reserves reflect more external assistance than export earnings—though this is projected to change as
electricity exports pick up. While the level of reserves is adequate, their composition remains
suboptimal. Further gradual increase in the share of rupee reserves is advised, in line with the
recommendation of the recent IMF TA, to better align the currency composition of reserves with
Bhutan’s external liabilities and trade structure. 12
34.
Staff encourages the authorities’ efforts to improve reserve management. The mission
welcomes the recent steps to strengthen reserve management, including the swap agreement with the
Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to receive liquidity support.13 It also welcomes the ongoing discussion with
the RBI to sell or buy Indian rupee (INR) against USD, and gain access to Indian Government securities.
In addition, Bhutan’s planned participation in the World Bank’s Reserve Advisory Management Program
will provide an opportunity to improve RMA’s debt management skills. The new reserve management
framework should mitigate the liquidity and the currency risk, avoid the risk of renewed Indian rupee
shortages, reduce credit risk and at the same time improve the return on reserves.

11

These include a strong track record of project implementation, commercial viability and close economic and
political ties with India, the main provider of financing for hydropower projects and the key consumer of Bhutanese
electricity.

12

As of February 2016, convertible currency reserves still represented close to 80 percent of total reserves.

13

Under the SAARC Currency Swap Agreement signed with the RBI, the RMA can make withdrawals of US dollar,
Euro or Indian Rupee up to a maximum US$100 million or its equivalent.

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BHUTAN

35.
Staff welcomes the removal of some of the exchange restrictions introduced in 2012. In
response to the rupee shortage, Bhutan introduced regulatory measures that gave rise to new
exchange restrictions subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Section 2(a). Subsequently, as the
situation stabilized, the restrictions on INR access for certain imports were removed in 2014. The
mission understands that since then, no new measures that would give rise to restrictions on the
making of payments and transfers for current international transactions or multiple currency practices
were introduced.
Authorities’ Views
36.
The authorities shared staff’s assessment of external debt vulnerability, and agreed with
staff’s view that reserve management needs to be improved. They noted the agreement with the
RBI that will provide them with more flexibility to actively manage the composition of foreign reserves
and address eventual temporary liquidity pressures. The authorities agreed that the projected increase
in hydropower exports should help repay a large part of the external debt, and underscored the need
to take this factor into account when assessing external debt vulnerability. However, far from being
complacent, they have also cautioned against relying too much on the hydropower sector to cushion all
external pressures. The authorities underscored the need to monitor separately the hydro and nonhydro parts of the balance of payments, to better understand the current developments and future
prospects. They noted that although the hydropower projects are fully financed, the development of
the hydropower sector can have repercussions on the current account balance, and suggested that to
address long-term balance of payment challenges, policies to encourage domestic production of
imported items may be needed. As Bhutan’s foreign reserves are built mainly on external aid inflows
and borrowing, the authorities continue to consider as necessary the maintenance of existing
restrictions under Article XIV, and those inconsistent with the Article VIII obligations (see Information
Annex).

STAFF APPRAISAL
37.
Bhutan’s economic performance has improved in recent years, but challenges lie ahead.
Following its deceleration in the wake of the “rupee shortage crisis” of 2012–13, growth has picked up
more recently. At the same time, inflation has been falling rapidly to record-low levels, reflecting a
decline in both imported and domestic goods inflation. The unemployment rate has been trending
down, though high youth unemployment continues to pose a problem. In the medium-term, growth is
projected to gain further momentum with the commissioning of new hydropower plants. As growth
accelerates, it will be important to ensure that overheating and imbalances do not arise.
38.
A disorderly easing of the fiscal stance should be avoided. In the first two years of the 11th
Five-Year Plan (FYP), capital spending has been subdued, despite higher-than-budgeted external
grants. Together with tight control on current spending, this resulted in a stronger fiscal balance. In the
final years of the current FYP, capital spending is expected to accelerate as project implementation
gathers speed. However, while some acceleration of capital spending is to be expected, staff cautions
against big jumps in capital spending. Large swings in the fiscal balance—as that implied by a

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

BHUTAN

FY2016/17 deficit in excess of 5 percent of GDP—would provide an unsuitably large stimulus and could
stretch the absorption capacity of the economy. Looking ahead, a stronger fiscal institutional
framework could help effectively manage the projected spike in revenues related to increased
hydropower production.
39.
Addressing weak revenue performance is crucial for maintaining long-term fiscal
sustainability and the exchange rate peg. The pegged exchange rate, together with the mild
overvaluation of the exchange rate, underscores the importance of fiscal sustainability and improved
domestic revenue performance. With external grants expected to gradually decline, the authorities are
properly emphasizing the need to increase reliance on domestic revenues to finance government
spending. However, in recent years, tax revenues have been weak, reflecting increased use of tax
expenditures that have been eroding the tax base, weakening tax compliance and complicating tax
administration. The policy of granting tax exemptions and incentives needs to be reassessed. Tax
expenditures usually do not deliver the expected benefits in terms of higher investment and growth,
but often entail high costs in terms of revenue erosion. At the same time, the reform of the sales tax,
with the objective of replacing the existing inefficient sales tax with a modern GST, should proceed as
planned and be implemented by 2018.
40.
Staff views monetary conditions to be broadly appropriate. After a sharp slowdown in the
wake of the “rupee shortage crisis” of 2012-13, credit growth has picked up more recently, but remains
within a moderate range. To absorb excess liquidity, the RMA appropriately increased the cash reserve
ratio (CRR) in March 2015, and at this time, there are no signs of excess or shortage of banking sector
liquidity. This being said, the RMA needs to remain vigilant, monitor liquidity conditions and credit
growth closely, and stand ready to respond as needed. In parallel, Bhutan’s still rudimental system of
liquidity management needs further improvement.
41.
Steps to strengthen financial supervision and regulation are welcome. The RMA is to be
commended for the effort to expand its toolkit of macroprudential regulation. Looking ahead, the
authorities need to close the gaps in the regulation of nonbank financial institutions. A more robust
and effective regulation and supervision framework should also provide a more solid ground for
policies to promote financial deepening, without incurring a risk to financial stability. Financial
soundness indicators point to a generally sound financial system: the capital ratio remains solid, and
NPLs have declined moderately.
42.
Even though the real exchange rate is assessed as moderately overvalued, the exchange
rate peg with India continues to serve Bhutan well. The adjusted external sustainability approach,
tailored to take into account the temporary effects of electricity-related exports and imports on the
current account balance, suggests a moderate real effective exchange rate overvaluation. Disciplined
fiscal and monetary policies supporting moderate inflation, as well as measures to improve business
climate, are needed for Bhutan to continue benefitting from the peg and ensure that the exchange rate
does not deviate significantly from its fundamentals.
43.
The level of external reserves is adequate, but further improvement in reserve
management is needed. All standard metrics of reserve adequacy show that Bhutan’s reserves are

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BHUTAN

adequate. With external reserves amounting to about one half of GDP, proper reserve management is
even more important. First, the currency composition of reserves needs to be better aligned with the
composition of external debt and trade flows, by reducing the share of convertible currency reserves
and increasing the share of the Indian rupee-denominated reserves. Second, new reserve management
policies and investment guidelines need to be implemented.
44.
The authorities did not request and staff does not recommend approval of the exchange
restrictions maintained inconsistent with Article VIII obligations. Bhutan continues to maintain
exchange restrictions under the transitional arrangements of Article XIV, Section 2. Staff recognize the
limited and unpredictable sources of convertible currency inflows and justifiable concerns over
outflows, and encourages the authorities to gradually ease the exchange restrictions towards their
eventual elimination, including restrictions that have been maintained under Article XIV, Section 2,
which should be eliminated as soon as Bhutan’s balance of payments positions permits. The authorities
are encouraged to consider accepting the obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3 and 4, of the
IMF’s Articles of Agreement in due course.
45.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on a 24-month cycle in
accordance with the Decision on Article IV Consultation Cycles (Decision No. 14747-10/96).

Box 1. Inflation in Bhutan: Near-Term Outlook and Considerations for the Long-Term1
Bhutan’s rate of inflation is closely linked to Indian inflation. This link is underpinned by a
combination of factors, namely:
(i)
Broadly similar consumption baskets between India and Bhutan. For example, food accounts
for about 40 percent of the CPI basket in Bhutan and about 50 percent in India;
(ii)
Large reliance of Bhutan’s economy on imports, of which 90 percent come from India;
(iii)
Long-standing free trade agreement (FTA) between India and Bhutan, which facilitates trade,
commerce, and transit between the two countries;
(iv)
Ngultrum’s peg to the Indian rupee, supported by the FTA’s provisions for facilitating trade
transactions in both currencies.
Over the near-term, Bhutan’s inflation is likely to remain slightly below that of India. Empirical
evidence featured in Bhutan’s 2014 Article IV Consultation (IMF Country Report No. 14/178) suggests
that (i) the inflation rates in the two countries co-move in the long-term, (ii) Indian inflation is exogenous
to that of Bhutan, and (iii) when a temporary divergence between the inflation rates in the two countries
emerges, Bhutan’s inflation tends to converge to that of India within about one year. The extension of
the VECM-based model of Bhutanese inflation to recent

shape Bhutan’s inflation prospects in the long term. The
adoption of a flexible inflation targeting regime with a 4 percent headline CPI inflation target and a +/- 2
percent band around it has been central to India’s anti-inflationary drive of the past few years. Progress
has also been made to enhance monetary transmission and underpin food supply through productivity
enhancing and market efficiency reforms. This has also helped to bring down both food and non-food
inflation in Bhutan. Going forward, the Bhutanese economy is set to benefit from India’s improved
inflation outlook, but idiosyncratic drivers will require continued careful monetary policy management.

Box 2. Bhutan’s Labor Market: Problems and Solutions1
Problem. Bhutan’s unemployment rate in 2014 was 2.6 percent (11,000 unemployed; this
compares with 50,000 foreign workers currently in Bhutan). The female unemployment rate was
3.5 percent, almost twice as much as the male unemployment rate of 1.9 percent. However, the
unemployment rate among young people is particularly high, and reached 9.7 percent in 2014.
The unemployment rate is also higher in urban areas (6.7 percent) than in rural areas (1.2 percent).
Causes. There are several causes of high unemployment among the youth. One is the mismatch
between the existing skills of young people and skills demanded by employers. Some occupations
are not perceived by youth as sufficiently “well-regarded” and there is not enough interest in
pursuing them. Furthermore, public sector jobs are often perceived as offering a better
combination of security and pay than private sector jobs. Urban youth also have high reservation
wage, and while there is no unemployment support, they receive support from their families while
unemployed. Finally, the hydropower sector— an important part of the economy—is not offering
many job opportunities. The construction phase is labor-intensive (up to 18,000 workers are
working at the ongoing three hydropower projects), but only about 20 percent are Bhutanese
citizens. This low number reflects either a lack of skills or unwillingness to take up jobs requiring
manual work.
Solutions. The government target is to bring the unemployment rate down to 2.5 percent. The
challenge is how to absorb the large number of unemployed young people, particularly as the
absorption capacity of the public sector is approaching its limits. There is no silver bullet.
Improving skills is one solution. The authorities have started six hydropower training centers to
provide workers with the qualifications for hydropower construction jobs, and they have been
organizing job fairs. All government agencies are required to build crèches, to facilitate
employment of women. The authorities have also launched a program of sending people overseas
for employment (mainly to India, Thailand and Middle East). The development of labor-intensive
SMEs, supported by better access to finance, could also help.

Box 3. Base Rate System in Bhutan1
The objective of Bhutan’s base rate system for interest rates is to improve credit market
transparency and efficiency, and monetary policy management. Bhutan’s base rate system has been in
place since 2012 and is modeled on the Indian base rate system implemented in 2010. A bank’s base rate is
a minimum rate at which it can lend, as loans are to be priced from the base rate with the addition of bankdetermined borrower-specific charges to account for loan product, credit risk, and term premium. As in
India, a base rate of a bank in Bhutan takes into account its cost of funds, costs of complying with certain
regulations (such as CRR or SLR), overhead costs, and profitability. A range of exemptions from the base
rate is also stipulated for lending to priority sectors, such as
Select Bank Lending Interest Rates
agriculture, small and artisan schemes, and entrepreneurship.
(In percent)
The base rates have been reviewed annually on the basis of 18

banks’ audited annual accounts. In India, banks were required 17

to take these variables into consideration but ultimately were

free in deciding on their base rates. In contrast, the Royal

Monetary Authority has played an active role in base rate

setting, including by imposing ad hoc adjustments to the
base rates to engender a greater uniformity of lending rates 11

across the financial system.

Addressing shortcomings of the current base rate system
is a policy priority. Steps have been taken to initiate semi-annual computation of base rates, as the current
practice of annual revisions significantly hampers monetary transmission by essentially imposing one yearlagged monetary conditions onto the next year’s base rate. The lack of uniformity in the application of the
base rate methodology, prompted by the practice of ad hoc adjustments to reduce variation of the base
rates across banks and financial institutions, has led to inefficiencies and hampered transparency.
Specifically, banks with access to external aid and hydropower-related funds have had significantly lower
calculated base rates, with further variation due to differences in capital base, operating environment, and
profitability parameters. In theory, a base rate should enhance monetary transmission by serving as a
reference for floating-rate loans, but in practice bank loans and advances in Bhutan are mostly mediumand longer-term and are set at fixed rates.
Improving the responsiveness of the base rate system to changes in monetary stance is of key
importance. As is also suggested by the Indian experience, the base rate system has proven ineffective in
responding to changes in the monetary policy stance as the average cost of funds used in the calculation
tends to adjust slowly relative to the marginal cost of funds. Indeed, India’s recently implemented Marginal
Cost of Funds-based Lending Rate (MCLR) which has replaced its base rate system, limits the funding costs
used in its calculation to more recently raised funds, assigns these funds a greater weight, and stipulates
monthly-based reviews. Adopting similar features could also be contemplated in Bhutan, in part to ensure a
more timely adjustment of Bhutan’s financial conditions to India’s improved inflation outlook and its new
monetary policy framework. In addition, this would help avoid an undue increase in real interest rates in
Bhutan that could chip away at the economic activity. Enhancing monetary transmission would also benefit
from promoting greater use of variable rate lending.

Box 4. External Sector Assessment1
The standard External Balance Assessment (EBA) methodologies are not well suited for
Bhutan. The application of the EBA Lite current account (CA) methodology for Bhutan in
FY2015/16 suggests a current account norm of about -8.7 percent of GDP, while the external
sustainability (ES) approach suggests a norm of about -5.5 percent of GDP. These approaches do
not take into account the temporary nature of hydropower-related imports and future electricity
exports, and incorrectly interpret large near-term CA deficits as sign of significant overvaluation.
As Bhutan is not part of the EBA Lite sample, country-specific constant in the REER methodology
was set at a level that ensures that the sum of sample residuals is zero during 1995–2013. As a
result, the 2015 REER is estimated to be undervalued by 7.8 percent.
The adjusted ES approach2, in turn, suggests that Ngultrum is mildly overvalued. The
adjustment incorporates the temporary effect of electricity-related exports and imports on the CA
path. Initially, there is an accumulation of foreign liabilities associated with imports of goods and
services related to the construction of hydropower plants. When the plants are commissioned, the
increase in electricity exports will turn the CA into a surplus and the net foreign assets (NFA) will
begin to rise. Specifically, in line with staff’s baseline macroeconomic scenario, the simulations
assume that Bhutan’s total electricity generation capacity will reach around 6,800 MW over the
next two decades. From then onwards, the generation capacity is held constant and the annual
growth of domestic consumption is assumed at 5 percent. From 2075, a year when electricity
generation is estimated to be sufficient to meet domestic consumption3, net electricity exports are
assumed at zero. The calculated equilibrium

factoring in the uncertainties and variability of
external flows related to hydropower development, the exchange rate is assessed to be mildly
overvalued. The external position is expected to follow a path that results in a reversal of the large
current account deficits and the negative net foreign asset position over the medium term. Bhutan
has an exchange rate peg with the Indian rupee, and macroeconomic policies are broadly
appropriate with this arrangement. International reserves have grown steadily over the recent
years and are adequate for precautionary purposes.

After a dip in reserves in FY2011/12 due to overheating pressures, Bhutan’s international reserves have grown steadily
over the last three years in large part resulting from aid inflows. At the end of FY2014/15 reserve holdings stood at US$958
million, corresponding to 10.4 months of prospective year imports. As of February 2016, reserve holdings reached US$1,022
million. Bhutan’s reserve position is higher than suggested by standard

The composite IMF metric for Bhutan is constructed by assuming that reserves have to fully cover the debt service requirements, part of the

Annex I. Risk Assessment Matrix
Nature/Source of
Threat

Likelihood

Impact

Policies to Minimize Impact

Domestic Risks

Mismatches in
rupee inflows
and outflows

H

H: Mismatches in Indian rupee inflows and outflows, and
prospective bulky debt service payments could lead to
renewed pressure on rupee reserves and could tighten
liquidity conditions.

Build Indian rupee buffers by holding a
larger share of reserves in rupees to meet
obligations. Develop a foreign exchange
cash-flow forecasting framework to
anticipate pressures and build buffers.

Delayed project
implementation

M

H: Delays in projected completion of hydropower
projects could lead to lower electricity exports and larger
fiscal deficits.

Constrain non-essential expenditure growth
and implement measures to broaden tax
base and improve tax administration.

Debt
sustainability

M

M. So far, hydropower projects have been governmentto-government. The next generation of hydropower
projects will rely on joint ventures, with some risks
shifting to the Government of Bhutan.

Strengthen the capacity to evaluate and
manage the risks from joint venture
hydropower projects.

Bank balance
sheet risks

M

M: Following a period of rapid credit growth, banks’
assets quality has been volatile and asset-liability
maturity mismatch persists. NPLs remain elevated, and
liquid assets ratio fell.

Avoid loosening of liquidity conditions.
Strengthen and intensify supervision and
tighten prudential regulations. Take early
action as signs of deteriorating asset quality
emerge.

External Risks

Structurally
weak growth in
key advanced
and emerging
economies

M

H: Delays in structural reform could weaken growth in
India, which could adversely affect non-hydro exports,
aid and hydropower construction disbursements to
Bhutan.

Scale back non-essential spending plans
while mobilizing domestic revenues, to
maintain scope for fiscal response.

Renewed pickup
of inflation in
India

M

M: The recent slowdown in India’s inflation could be
temporary, reflecting decline in global commodity prices.
Renewed inflation would push up imported inflation
from India which would hurt the poor.

Tighten monetary conditions and reduce
bank liquidity to prevent second-round
effects from building.

Tourism
slowdown

H

M: Nepal earthquake and regional security concerns
adversely affect tourism receipts.

Promote other sources of BOP receipts such
as FDI.

“L”=Low; “M”=Medium; “H”=High.
This matrix shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The
relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline. The Risk Assessment Matrix reflects staff
views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with authorities.

Exchange System

Since its introduction in 1974, the ngultrum has been pegged to the Indian rupee at par. Bhutan
continues to avail itself of transitional arrangements under Article XIV, Section 2, pursuant to which
it maintains exchange restrictions in connection with: (i) the availability of foreign exchange for
travel, except for medical travel abroad by Bhutanese citizens, invisibles, and private transfers; (ii)
foreign exchange balancing requirement on remittances of income in convertible currencies or other
foreign currencies from FDI; and (iii) the availability of foreign exchange for importers who are not
able to provide the identity of the seller.
Bhutan also maintains exchange restrictions subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Section 2(a)
in connection with: (i) the FX balancing requirements for imports of capital goods (for projects
involving FDI) and primary raw materials (for certain industrial projects); (ii) banning residents who
do not comply with the requirement to repatriate export proceeds from accessing foreign exchange
for unrelated imports; (iii) requiring foreign direct investment businesses to pay for their
establishment and operational expenses from their own convertible currency resources; (iv)
requiring Bhutanese companies to pay the interest on and amortization of external loans from their
own convertible currency resources; (v) restricting the availability of Indian rupee for making
payments and transfers to India in the following current international transactions: personal and
business travel and study-abroad living arrangement, family, advance payments for imports from
India and to recruit Indian workers and (vi) banning the access to Indian rupee for unrelated current
international transactions for those who contravene RMA ‘s 2012 guidelines on Indian rupee
transactions. On September 1, 2014, the RMA reintroduced housing and vehicle loans (after
temporary suspension of access to Indian rupees to finance imports of personal vehicles and
housing construction materials in March 2012).1
Staff is in the process of assessing other measures introduced by the authorities with respect to their
implications to Bhutan’s obligations under Article VIII, Section 2(a) and 3.

Article IV Consultation
Bhutan is on a 24-month consultation cycle. The 2014 Article IV consultation was concluded by the
Executive Board on June 20, 2014.

_______________________

1
This measure removed the previous exchange restrictions found on the access to Indian rupee for imports of
certain construction materials and vehicles from India. Staff also found that the exchange restriction on access to
Indian rupees for salary remittances by non-residents has been removed. For a description of the measures which
lead to the remaining findings of exchange restrictions outlined above, please see IMF Country Report No. 14/179
(Informational Annex).

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
(As of April 2016)
The World Bank Group (WBG) Strategy in Bhutan
The WBG Board endorsed the new Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Bhutan on September 23,
2014. It supports the Royal Government of Bhutan Eleventh Five-Year Plan (11FYP) (2013–2018)
approved by the Parliament in October 2013. The government focuses on Self Reliance and Inclusive
Green Socio-economic Development in the Eleventh Five year Plan. Self-Reliance is interpreted as
“ability to meet all national development needs as articulated through 5 year plans by 2020” and
Inclusive development refers to “reducing poverty and inequality by enhancing the standard of living
and the quality of life of the most vulnerable sections of the society”.
The CPS seeks to protect Bhutan’s recent gains in reducing poverty through a continued focus on
improving rural livelihoods and managing urbanization, while protecting its natural assets (ongoing
investment lending in all three areas). The CPS organizes activities under three results areas: (i)
improving fiscal and spending efficiency, (ii) increasing private sector growth and competitiveness,
and (iii) supporting green development, implemented by the IDA and the IFC, through financial,
analytical and advisory support.
International Development Association (IDA) - “World Bank”
IDA Portfolio and Pipeline
The World Bank provides around $15-20 million of new IDA resources per year. There are four ongoing
specific investment operations for a net commitment of $82 million of IDA. These include three
country specific IDA operations: Urban Development II and additional financing, Remote Rural
Communities Development; one regional IDA project: Regional Cooperation on Wildlife Protection; as
well as one GEF grant operation: Sustainable financing for biodiversity conservation. In addition, the
Bank manages several small grants for Bhutan on climate resilience, disaster management, public
financial management, urban budget processes, REDD+.
The World Bank has also extended three development policy operations over the last six years. The
most recent, Development Policy Credit (DPC-2) was approved by the World Bank’s Board of Executive
Directors in August 2014 for a total of $20 million. It is the first of a two-operation series, focusing on
macroeconomic and fiscal sustainability and improving the investment climate. Projects under
preparation include a regional project to facilitate trade and ICT connectivity, the second and last
operation of the Development Policy Credit series, a GAFSP-funded agriculture project, a regional
hydromet project and a public transport project funded by GPOBA.
Analytical and Advisory Services (ASA)
Ongoing analytic work includes a Public Expenditure and Financial Assessment (PEFA), an assessment
of the environmental and social impact of hydropower, a labor market study, an agribusiness note
and an investment climate assessment. Recent analytic work include a policy note on the
macroeconomic impact of hydropower and the role of public finance, a green growth study, a food-

security policy note, a poverty assessment. Technical assistance activities support an improved
investment climate, mining policy, a financial sector action plan and implementation, the review of
Bhutan’s tourism policy, hydromet, disaster management and climate change (Bhutan is a pilot PPCR
country), a procurement review to allow Thimphu municipality to use Alternative Procurement
arrangements, support to the statistical system to use CAPI solutions for surveys. A Multi-Donor Trust
Fund on Public Financial Management is expected to become effective in September 2016, with the
EU and ADA contributing a total of US$4m. The Bhutan Royal Monetary Authority is expected to
become a member of the Reserve Advisory Management Program (RAMP) of the World Bank Treasury.
International Finance Corporation (IFC)
The IFC has a total committed investment portfolio in Bhutan of about $34 million. The portfolio
consists predominantly of IFC’s investments in the financial sector and support for the expansion of a
local hotel. IFC, using some of its own funds and mobilizing funds from the Global Agriculture and
Food Security Program together with ADB are investing $12 million in a hazelnut plantation project.
IFC’s first debt assistance of $10 million to a hotel was made in 2003 and successfully liquidated in
June 2015.
The advisory portfolio includes advice in structuring PPPs, improving Bhutan’s investment climate and
enhancing access to financial services. IFC is also providing assistance to the Ministry of Economic
Affairs and Druk Holding and Investments to help them consider setting up a power trading company
in India.
IFC continues to explore areas of assistance in the hydropower, tourism, manufacturing, agribusiness,
health, and education sectors, among others. IFC’s advisory support on investment climate reforms,
infrastructure development through PPPs and the financial sector is expected to continue.
Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA)
On October 21, 2014, Bhutan became the 181st member of MIGA. In light of Bhutan’s recent
membership, MIGA has not provided guarantee coverage for investment in Bhutan to date.

RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
Bhutan became a member in 1982 and ADB began its lending operations to the country in 1983.
Bhutan is classified as a Group A country and is eligible for the Asian Development Fund (ADF)
resources. Classified as moderately debt stressed, Bhutan has been receiving a 50:50 mix of ADF
loan and ADF grant assistance since 2011. Cost-sharing ceiling has been set at 99 percent for loans,
technical assistance, and other grants.
ADB assistance has followed closely Bhutan’s Five Year Plans (FYP) and been guided by ADB’s
country partnership strategies (CPS) and country operations business plans (COBP). The CPS (20142018) and COBP (2016-2018) are currently being implemented in line with the government’s
Eleventh FYP (2013–2018) and Strategy 2020─ADB’s Long-Term Strategic Framework The
overarching goal of the current CPS (2014-2018) is to support three strategic pillars: inclusive
economic growth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional cooperation and integration
(RCI). The core sectors of ADB operations are energy (including development of hydropower
generation and transmission) finance, transport, and water and other urban infrastructure and
services. The country assistance program evaluation, conducted in 2010, rated ADB country
operations and programs in Bhutan successful, which were found to be well aligned with country
development needs, government development priorities, and Strategy 2020.
ADB has been closely coordinating with other development partners in key sectors to avoid
duplication. It provided parallel financing for urban development in Thimphu with the World Bank,
and for rural electrification with the Japan International Cooperation Agency and the Austrian
Development Agency. ADB also collaborated with SNV on renewable energy, and is currently
supporting a pilot biogas project in southern Bhutan, which builds on the experience of SNV to
create a viable biogas sector. Other examples of effective partnerships include ADB’s rural
electrification loans following the Rural Electrification Master Plan, which was developed with
assistance from the Government of Japan. Similarly, development partners are using the Road Sector
Master Plan, which was developed with ADB assistance. ADB’s resident mission in Thimphu is
helping further strengthen its partnership and coordination with development partners.
The current COBP covers the period 2016–2018. The indicative cumulative lending allocation for this
period is $327.87 . The 2016-2018 lending program will help develop the South Asia Subregional
Economic Cooperation (SASEC) Transport, Trade Facilitation, and Logistics Project), Air Transport
Connectivity Enhancement Project, Urban Infrastructure Project, Improved Urban Environmental
Infrastructure Project, Amochhu River Training and Flood Prevention Project, SASEC Green Power
Investment Program. A nonlending program of $2.3 million has been programmed for 2016−2018.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Statistical Issues Appendix
(as of May 20, 2016)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision – particularly timeliness - has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. Most
affected areas are: national accounts, balance of payments, and fiscal data.
Real sector: As part of a Japan-funded technical assistance project for the Implementation of the System of National Accounts
and the International Comparison Project, the Statistics Department of the IMF (STA) has been providing technical assistance to
improve the national accounts and develop a producer price index.
National Accounts: The accuracy and reliability of the data are affected by inadequate source data. Key shortcomings include
heavy reliance on production data collected by line ministries, which often lack quality control, long lags in providing estimates,
large revisions of historical data and, in certain cases, ad hoc estimation procedures. Lack of reliable data on expenditure
components hampers estimation of national savings and domestic investment. The key factors contributing to the data
deficiency are the shortage of qualified personnel and facilities. The National Statistical Bureau (NSB) is also constrained by the
absence of a Statistics Act. Thus far, Bhutan does not produce quarterly national accounts data, and STA has been providing TA
on the quarterly compilation. Annual data are provided with long lags.
Price statistics: Starting in 2004, the consumer price index (CPI) is compiled on a quarterly basis, the number of commodity
prices has been greatly expanded, and the geographical scope broadened. Monthly CPI series for domestic and imported goods
starting from April 2013 are now being released.
Government finance statistics: Despite recent improvements in the quality of government finance statistics (GFS), the fiscal
data are subject to frequent and substantial revisions, particularly in the expenditure area. The compilation and dissemination of
budget execution data and GFS are very limited. Only annual budget execution data are compiled and disseminated, and with a
long lag. No GFS are disseminated nationally. The authorities were planning to start producing and distributing internally
quarterly data, but thus far there has been little progress. There are inconsistencies between the fiscal and monetary data with
regard to bank financing, stemming from differences in the definition of government.
Monetary statistics: While monetary statistics are generally consistent with the Fund’s guidelines, there is room for
improvement in a number of areas, specifically: (i) the valuation of financial assets is based on purchase price while market or
market-price equivalents would be preferable; (ii) to avoid misclassifications, a list of government units and nonfinancial public
enterprises should be prepared and shared with the reporting financial institutions; During the technical assistance mission on
Monetary and Financial Statistics (MFS) in March 2010, the authorities and STA improved the timeliness of data reporting to STA
to be in line with national publications. As part of the mission objectives, the Royal Monetary Authority (RMA) has also
submitted to STA the Financial Soundness Indicators (FSI) for Bhutan on a quarterly basis, and the FSI have been published on
the IMF’s FSI website: http://fsi.imf.org/.
Balance of payments: External sector statistics has improved recently. BOP and IIP dissemination moved from annual to
quarterly, to sixth BOP and IIP format. RMA is expected soon to start reporting external debt statistics to the World bank’s
Quarterly External Debt Statistics Database. Coverage, accuracy and timeliness of ESS data has improved. Despite recent
improvements, external statistics continue to be affected by shortcomings. These include: (i) limited coverage of services’
transactions in the current account, (ii) long lags in dissemination and lack of high frequency data.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Bhutan participates in the General Data Dissemination

System (GDDS), and posted metadata for the first time on
the Fund’s Dissemination Standard Bulletin Board (DSBB)
in May 2010. After the e-GDDS superseded the GGDS in
May 2015, Bhutan was assessed as Basline-2,
disseminating all 15 recommended data categories. STA is
providing assistance in creating a National Summary Data
Page consistent with e-GDDS.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS1

June 8, 2016

Approved By
Paul Cashin and Andrea
Richter Hume (IMF) and
Satu Kahkonen (IDA)

Prepared by
International Monetary Fund
International Development Association

The assessment of Bhutan’s external risk has not changed materially from the 2014 DSA.
Since FY2010/11, Bhutan’s rapid hydropower development has led to a substantial
buildup of external debt. As a consequence, external debt ratios breach all indicative
thresholds, and these breaches are projected to continue for several more years.2 The
extent and length of these breaches indicate a high risk of external debt distress. However,
based on unique mitigating circumstances (as spelled out in the 2014 DSA), staff continue
to assess Bhutan’s external risk as moderate. These mitigating factors are as follows. A
large share of external debt is linked to hydropower project loans from the Government of
India (GoI). GoI covers both financial and construction risks of these projects and buys the
surplus electricity output at a price reflecting cost plus a 15 percent net return. India’s
large unmet demand for power and the political commitment to increase its reliance on
clean energy ensure a strong demand even in the current environment of low prices of
alternative energy sources. As a result, Bhutan’s debt situation is expected to improve in
the medium and long term, reflecting significantly higher electricity exports when
hydropower projects come on stream. This being said, stress tests to public sector debt
dynamics reveal the need for fiscal consolidation and the importance of sustaining
economic growth going forward.

1

This DSA was prepared by IMF and International Development Association staff in collaboration with the
Asian Development Bank and Bhutanese authorities. The analysis updates the previous Joint DSA dated May
30, 2014 (IMF Country Report No. 14/178). The DSA follows the IMF and World Bank Staff Guidance Note on
the Application of the Joint Fund-Bank Debt Sustainability Framework for Low-Income Countries (November 7,
2013). The data underlying the analysis are from the Bhutanese authorities, IMF, and World Bank staff
estimates.
2

The magnitude of the breach has increased due to the revision of the Country Policy and Institutional
Ratings (CPIA) to medium, from a strong rating in the 2014 DSA. In 2013 and 2014, Bhutan’s 3-year moving
average CPIA ratings were 3.74 and 3.71, marginally below the “strong” rating threshold of 3.75.

BHUTAN

BACKGROUND
1.
Bhutan’s public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) external debt jumped to 94 percent of GDP in
2013, up from 75 percent of GDP in 2012, and has remained relatively stable in 2014 and 2015.3 The
earlier rise in public debt was driven mainly by hydropower sector-related external borrowing (see text chart
below). Hydropower projects are primarily financed by India with a mix of loans (70 percent) and grants
(30 percent).4 External debt continues to be dominated in Indian rupees (and related to hydropower sector
debt), which accounts for about 70 percent of total external debt, with convertible currency debt accounting
only 30 percent of GDP. Domestic debt remains a small fraction of public debt.

UNDERLYING DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
ASSUMPTIONS
2.
The baseline scenario assumes that additional expansion of Bhutan’s power generation
capacity will triple the generation capacity. Presently, five hydropower plants are operating, with total
capacity about 1,600 megawatts (MW). The hydropower development policy of Bhutan currently envisages
eight new hydropower projects to be commissioned by 2026 (see table below), adding 5,200 MW to
3

The DSA uses fiscal years (FY). For example, 2013 means FY 2012/13.

4

The second generation of hydropower projects will be based on joint venture (JV) models (see text table below). In
this model, 70 percent of the project will be financed by loans from India, while the remaining 30 percent will the
financed by equity equally split between India and Bhutan’s governments. India will provide a grant to Bhutan to
finance its equity share.

Bhutan’s power generation capacity.5 Total techno-economically feasible hydropower potential is estimated
to be 24,000 MW. External financing for non-hydropower sector activities continues to remain

3.
The hydropower sector will continue to have a major impact on the rest of the economy as
summarized by the following key baseline macroeconomic assumptions.


Real sector: Similar to the spike in real GDP when Tala was commissioned in 2006/07, Puna I,
Mangdechhu and Puna II will continue to boost economic growth as they come on stream in
2017/18 and 2018/19.6 Real growth is projected to average around 9 percent in 2016–21,
higher than the 10-year historical average of 7.4 percent. Growth will accelerate significantly
in 2018-2019, with the commissioning of the above-mentioned plants, and then moderate to
an average 5.5 percent in 2022–36.



Fiscal sector: Upon completion, the commissioning of hydropower projects will boost
temporarily the domestic revenue-to-GDP ratio, mainly as a result of higher nontax revenues
(transfer of profits and dividend payments). External budgetary aid is assumed to decline
sharply during the 13th FYP (2024–2028) as Bhutan’s per capita income rises. On average, the
overall fiscal deficit remains broadly balanced over the long term.



External sector: The current account deficit is projected to remain close to the current levels
till 2017, and then to start declining rapidly, as a result of significant increase in electricity
exports upon the completion of hydropower projects. In the medium-term, electricity exports
are estimated to more than quintuple from current levels, and the current account balance
should move to a surplus by 2025, with external reserves increasing significantly.

5

There is uncertainty surrounding the exact timing of the projects, as well as the future of some additional projects
under discussion that are not included in the projection.
6 Prior to commissioning, construction of these hydropower plants has been the second largest contributor after
services to real growth during the 10th FYP. A more than doubling of electricity generation capacity with the
commissioning of these plants will lead to a jump in electricity exports and fiscal revenue, providing a much larger
boost to economic growth in comparison to the construction phase.

EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
A. Baseline
4.
Bhutan’s external debt ratios remain above the LIC-DSA indicative thresholds during the first
half of the projected period under the baseline, but the commissioning of the hydropower projects
in 2017/18 and 2018/19 and the start of debt repayment put the debt ratio on a steady downward
trajectory. Bhutan’s external debt is driven mainly by hydropower developments. External PPG debt as a
share of GDP is projected to peak at 113 percent in 2017, with disbursements for hydropower-sector
projects, before declining slightly to 111 percent of GDP in 2018.7 As the first phase of hydro construction
comes to an end (see table above) and debt repayment starts, the stock of PPG debt is projected to start
falling briskly, to below the 50 percent of GDP by 2026, and to below 10 percent of GDP by 2036. As a
result, the present value (PV) of PPG external debt-to-GDP gradually declines to only 5 percent over the
long term, crossing the 40 percent indicative threshold in 2027. The PV of PPG debt-to-exports ratio
remains above the threshold of 150 percent until 2024, but falls to 15 percent at the end of the projected
period. Similarly, the PV of PPG external debt-to-revenues ratio peaks at close to 722 percent in 2018, but
falls below the 250 percent threshold in 2025, and to 24 percent by 2036.
5.
The PPG debt service-to-export ratio is projected to exceed the indicative thresholds in the
medium term intermittently by a relatively small margin. The PPG debt service-to export ratio peaks at
around 24 percent in 2017 and 2018. However, as exports pick up and debt repayment declines, the ratio
falls below the 20 percent threshold by 2019, before rising above the threshold again marginally in 2020–22.
In contrast, reflecting partly conservative revenue projection, the debt service-to-revenue ratio remains
moderately above the 20 percent indicative threshold for most of the projected period, falling below only in
2032.

B. Sensitivity Analysis
6.
The indicative thresholds for the PV of PPG external debt-to-GDP, debt-to-exports and debtto-revenue ratios are breached under alternative scenarios and stress tests. All these indicators breach

In the 2014 DSA, public external debt was projected to peak at 120 percent of GDP. The main reason for the lower
debt in the present DSA is the lower number of hydropower projects in the pipeline (three projects less).

their respective thresholds after the shocks in 2016, and most continue to breach the threshold for an
extended period of time. The standard sensitivity analysis points to a high risk of debt distress (Figure 1 and
Table 2). In particular, historical alternative scenario and bound test with exports in 2017–18 linked to
historical average show very large breach. However, these scenarios fail to capture the projected jump in
hydropower exports or fiscal revenues. Similarly, the worsening of external debt indicators under the bound
test of 30 percent nominal depreciation in 2017 overestimates Bhutan's debt vulnerability as a large share of
Bhutan’s external income is in Indian rupees, which act as a natural hedge to the largely rupee-denominated
external debt.
7.
Debt service ratios indicative thresholds, too, are breached for large part of the projection
period. As in the case of PPG external debt ratios, the historical scenario shows the largest breach for the
debt service ratios as well. Debt service ratios remain above their respective thresholds under the historical
scenario for the whole projection period. Under the bound tests, debt service ratios return eventually below
their thresholds, but mostly late in the projection period.

PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
A. Baseline
8.
The baseline public debt dynamics follows closely that of the external debt. The PV of public
debt exceeds the public debt benchmark by a significant amount. The public debt-to-GDP ratio is projected
to peak at around 115 percent of GDP in 2017, less than the 129 percent of GDP peak in the 2014 DSA.
After 2017, public debt is projected to decline steadily, falling to below 60 percent in 2027 and to 49 percent
by 2036. Bhutan’s public debt consists mainly of the external debt, and thus the same assessment of the
unique mitigating circumstances as in the case of the PPG external debt above applies. With the gradually
declining role of external financing, domestic financing is assumed to start playing a larger role in the
financing of the development agenda, and the share of domestic debt in the public debt will increase.

B. Sensitivity Analysis
9.
The public debt ratios are projected to be on a declining path over the long term under
alternative scenarios and various stress tests. However, the scenario with the primary balance unchanged
from the 2016 level fails to capture additional revenues from the commissioned hydropower plants, and
shows only a very gradual decline in the debt ratio. The sensitivity analysis also suggests that the debt and
debt service ratios are sensitive to negative growth shocks. However, the size of the negative growth shock
in 2017-20 is substantially magnified by the fact that growth is projected to peak during this period, with the
commissioning of the new hydropower plants.

STAFF ASSESSMENT
10.
The current assessment remains broadly the same as the assessment made in the 2014
IMF/World Bank Joint DSA, which found that Bhutan’s debt dynamics are subject to a moderate risk
of distress. Even though Bhutan’s PPG external debt indicators continue to breach external debt thresholds

by large margins and for a long period, the unique and mitigating factors discussed in detail in the 2014
DSA remain valid and underpin staffs’ unchanged assessment.


The current and projected PPG external debt is now somewhat less than projected in the
2014 DSA, due to the fact that some hydropower projects have been put on hold. In 2015,
PPG external debt stock reached 94.5 percent of GDP, 20 percentage points less than
projected in the previous DSA. However, as mentioned above, Bhutan’s CPIA rating has also
worsened, from ‘strong” to “medium”—even though the overall decline in CPIA score was
relatively modest, to 3.74 and 3.71, marginally below the “strong” rating threshold of 3.75.
Even with the lower CPIA rating and thus lower debt and debt service thresholds, these are
mostly breached for similar or shorter period than in the previous DSA, reflecting the lower
current and projected debt.



India provides explicit guarantees that cover financial and construction risks for the intragovernmental hydropower projects. In addition, India buys all surplus power that is not
consumed domestically, and the price is on a cost-plus basis which includes a net return of
15 percent. As a result, hydropower loans from India are more akin to foreign direct
investment rather than debt-creating loans. Moreover, in power-hungry India, there is little
risk of insufficient demand for future hydropower supply. This arrangement significantly
reduced the risk of external debt distress.



Bhutan’s hydropower production, exports and thus the capacity to service its debt will
increase only in the medium term. Therefore, staff continue to advice against any
nonconcessional borrowing at this stage. As highlighted previously and confirmed again by
the present DSA, Bhutan is vulnerable to adverse shocks. DSA’s stress testing illustrates
potential vulnerabilities in Bhutan’s external debt situation to export and growth shocks, as
well as to shortfalls in aid inflows and failure to reverse declining tax revenues.



Assuming they are effectively executed and associated macroeconomic challenges properly
managed, the additional hydropower projects should eventually bring solid economic
dividends, supporting higher exports and income.



The authorities agreed with staff’s assessment of external risk. They emphasized that the
projected increase in hydropower exports should help repay a big part of the external debt,
and underscored the need to take this factor into account when assessing the external debt
vulnerability.

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly a
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Statement by Subir Gokarn, Executive Director for Bhutan
and Indu Chaturvedi, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
June 22, 2016
1.
Our authorities’ discussions with the 2016 Article IV mission were constructive and
productive. The mission chief, Mr. Jiri Jonas and his team have an excellent understanding of the
macro-economic situation in Bhutan, including the unique features of the country’s economy.
The authorities wish to place on record their appreciation of the outstanding work done by the
IMF mission team. They also broadly agree with the assessment made in the Article IV report,
and hope to benefit from staff’s recommendations.
2.
Our authorities are also thankful to IMF staff and management for the Fund’s
engagement with Bhutan over the years. As the country endeavors to achieve rapid socioeconomic progress, it also needs to develop capacities in various areas of economic management.
The authorities have, in this task, received from the Fund both encouragement and assistance, of
which they are deeply appreciative. Indeed, Bhutan has been a major beneficiary of Fund
technical assistance (TA). Eighteen TA missions were completed in FY2015; fifteen were
completed in FY2016; and three have been completed and six are planned for completion in
FY2017; These cover diverse areas, including budget planning, government finance statistics,
balance of payment statistics, AML/CFT, currency management and national accounts.
3.
Bhutan’s development record over the last three decades has been impressive, and
particularly so in recent years. GDP per capita more than doubled during 2004-14. During 20002014, the percentage of population below poverty line reduced from 36.3 to 12, infant mortality
fell from 68.4 to 29.7 and universal primary enrollment was achieved. There have been similar
marked improvements in several other indicators also- maternal mortality ratio, immunization
coverage, road connectivity in rural areas, rural electrification and so on. Bhutan scores very well
on indicators of environment - more than 80 percent of the country’s land area is under forest
cover, it is a net sink for Global Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions, the quality of water at the
macro level is very high and air pollution is considerably lower than internationally acceptable
levels.
4.
Our authorities are committed to building on this strong track record and following
policies that ensure both macroeconomic stability and strong and inclusive growth. They
recognize that addressing the several challenges that lie ahead would require both sound
macroeconomic management and structural reforms. These challenges include managing
hydropower related inflows, managing the projected spike in hydropower revenues keeping in
view the likely phasing out of external aid, and addressing youth and urban unemployment.
5.
The authorities are in agreement with staff’s assessment that Bhutan’s medium-term
outlook is favorable. They are confident that with the commissioning of new hydropower
generation projects, growth will significantly accelerate from FY2017/18 and the current account
will return a surplus. The financial sector has been assessed as generally healthy by staff. While
the authorities note staff’s emphasis on containing the fiscal deficit in FY2016/17 and
FY2017/18, they feel that staff’s concerns about fiscal outcomes are somewhat overstated.
6.
The authorities are cognizant of the need for avoiding an excessively expansionary stance
and large shifts in the fiscal balance. The fiscal deficit in FY2015/16 is projected to be
significantly lower than what was budgeted for. Though it is correct that capital spending tends

2
to pick up in the last two years of the five year plans, the authorities endeavor to ensure that the
selected projects are not beyond the implementing capacity of the government agencies. They
also recognize the need for increasing tax revenues and are hopeful of introducing a new goods
and services tax (GST), with Parliament’s approval, by the end of 2018. On the expenditure side,
they have taken several measures to contain current spending. Going forward, they also intend to
strengthen the fiscal framework with a view to containing public debt and avoiding excessive
volatility in the fiscal stance. However, any such framework will have to keep in view the fact
that as hydropower exports and revenues increase and GDP growth accelerates, external support
is likely to reduce. This is an area to which the authorities plan to give more attention in the
coming months.

Staff’s advice on monetary policy is consistent with the authorities’ own views. The
current monetary policy stance is viewed as suited to the prevailing monetary conditions. There
is certainly a need to improve the monetary policy transmission mechanism which currently
relies solely on the cash reserve ratio (CRR). The authorities will carefully consider staff’s
suggestions in this regard and follow a graded approach in moving forward, mindful of the need
for adequate institutional capacities and supporting legal frameworks. They also intend to review
the base rate system keeping in view both the wide-spread dissatisfaction with it and staff’s
suggestions, which include learning from the Indian experience.

As reported by staff, a comprehensive framework for macro-prudential policy was put in
place by the RMA in 2014 and some macro-prudential regulations have already been
implemented. The authorities intend to implement additional regulations in the coming months,
in doing which the advice of the recent TA mission on banking supervision and regulation
should prove useful.

In the external sector, the large current account deficit and the high external public debt
should be seen in the background of the large external investment and imports relating to the
hydropower projects that are under implementation. The authorities feel that there is no reason
for concern on these counts. As already stated, the current account should move to a surplus once
hydropower exports pick up. Also, staff rightly points out the unique circumstances that mitigate
the external risks that appear high because of the current level of the ratio of public and public
guaranteed (PPG) debt to GDP. Though the current level of international reserves is high,
covering about 11 months of imports, this too needs to be seen in the context of the current
hydropower centered development strategy. These reserves are built largely on external aid flows
and borrowing for the hydropower related investments. The authorities note staff’s advice for
further improvement in the composition of foreign reserves. They would not describe the Rupee
shortage of 2012-13 as a crisis. They also do not consider the risk of another rupee shortage as
likely, particularly because of RMA’s recent swap agreement with the RBI which would enable
RMA to have access to short-term Indian Rupee liquidity support. Moreover, arrangements to
sell or buy Indian Rupees against USD and gain access to Indian Government securities are
being currently pursued.

The authorities consider it important that spillovers from development of hydropower are
managed well. They are keen to separately keep track of developments in the hydropower and
non-hydropower sectors. In particular, they would like to separate the impact of developments in
the two sectors on the balance of payments. Fund technical assistance in this regard will be very
welcome.

Our authorities also plan to give attention to the problem of high youth and urban
unemployment. Development of the private sector and diversification of the economy would be
critical to addressing this challenge. In the near term, they see the need for employment of a
significantly greater number of Bhutanese citizens in the construction of hydropower projects.
All necessary measures will be taken to substantially raise the percentage of Bhutanese citizens
employed in construction of these projects from the current low level of 20 percent. Staff has
rightly mentioned the need for addressing the existing lack of skills in this regard. However, the
authorities do not agree with staff that a lack of willingness to take up jobs requiring manual
work could also be a contributing factor to this state of affairs. A more plausible contributing
factor would be lack of awareness about the job opportunities that are likely to be created
resulting in lack of acquisition of the required skills. The authorities intend to address all such
factors.
