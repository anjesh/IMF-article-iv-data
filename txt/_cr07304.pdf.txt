Executive Summary
Background and Challenges
The economy has been recovering since the civil conflict, but the country remains the
poorest in the region and heavily dependent on logging and aid. Macroeconomic stability
has been maintained and growth has averaged 6 percent since mid-2003, but per capita
income remains the lowest in the region. In 2007, growth is expected to be 5½ percent,
mostly reflecting an escalation in logging from an already unsustainable rate. The current
account deficit is expected to widen sharply due to imports related to the gold mine, but
strong aid flows and FDI should keep reserve cover at a comfortable level. The budget is too
expansionary but projected to remain in surplus. Inflation is expected to ease to 7 percent.
The political situation remains fragile and medium-term challenges daunting. Political
instability could resurface and donor relations have been strained but are improving. The
logging stock is now estimated to decline sharply after 2009 and aid flows will likely slow.
Absent higher nonlogging growth, living standards will stagnate.
Key Policy Issues
These challenges require a more integrated and forward-looking approach and
immediate actions. Some progress has been made in structural reforms, but a wellprioritized country-led development strategy is needed and early actions should focus on:
•
Maintaining fiscal prudence and anchoring fiscal policy to a medium-term
framework. With the prospect of declining revenues and aid, and the need to increase
priority spending while reducing debt, the authorities should: maintain their revenue efforts,
continue refraining from borrowing until all debt indicators fall below the thresholds; save
most of the likely revenue overperformance compared to the 2007 Budget; and adopt a
medium-term budget framework that explicitly recognizes impending pressures. Early
measures to improve the poor performance of state-owned enterprises and passage of the
National Provident Fund bill are also necessary to mitigate the risks to the budget and
strengthen governance.
•
Easing the binding constraints to growth. Measures should aim at reducing high
business costs─expensive and unreliable utilities, weak transport infrastructure, and skilled
labor shortages─and addressing poor governance stemming from opaque rules, unwarranted
government discretion, and land tenure uncertainties.
The current exchange rate policy is appropriate, but the CBSI should strengthen its
monetary management and financial supervision. With strong inflows, the currency has
been stabilized against the U.S. dollar but downward pressure should not be resisted. The
CBSI should adopt a more forward-looking approach to countering inflation pressures if they
materialize, and tighten prudential measures to ensure asset quality remains high.
The statistical data base hampers surveillance and should continue to be improved.

I. BACKGROUND
1.
The economy has been recovering since the end of the civil conflict, but the
Solomon Islands remains the poorest country in the region and relies heavily on logging
and aid. Since the intervention of the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands
(RAMSI) in mid-2003, growth has averaged 6 percent and financial stability has been
maintained (Table 1). Nevertheless, with one of the fastest growing populations in the world,
per capita income is the lowest in the region. Economic activity continues to rely on the
unsustainable exploitation of the country’s forests and large donor assistance. Social
indicators are poor, and most MDGs are unlikely to be met (Annex V).

2.
After a rocky period following the 2006 elections, relations with donors have
improved recently, but the political situation remains fragile. The government survived a
no-confidence vote last February and has taken steps to mend relations with donors. Aid
flows have been largely unaffected, but tensions remain, and political instability could
resurface given shifting political alliances.
3.
The government program focuses on rural development, but a comprehensive
and well-articulated development and poverty reduction strategy has yet to be
elaborated. The government Policy Translation and Implementation Document emphasizes a
bottom-up approach to development. At the same time, implementation of some donorassisted sector strategies in education, health, transport, and agriculture are benefiting from
improved capacity of some government departments. To bring order to these separate
initiatives, recently there appears to be some renewed interest in reviving a national
development strategy, which was shelved late last year contrary to Fund advice, after the
change in government.
4.
The effectiveness of past surveillance has been mixed. Progress has been made in
simplifying foreign investment applications, developing transport infrastructure, reducing tax
exemptions, and monitoring aid delivery. Nevertheless, reforms of state-owned enterprises
(SOEs), the National Provident Fund (NPF), and the proposed liquidation of the troubled
Development Bank of the Solomon Islands (DBSI) have fallen short of expectations. The

6
large civil service wage increases approved last October contradicted Fund advice. The
backpedaling on the increase in the reference prices of logs, little follow-up to the Auditor
General’s Special Audits, and controversial government appointments have reinforced
perceptions of uneven progress on governance.
5.
Longer-term challenges are
daunting. Based on a new government
report, the fast-declining stock of logs is
now estimated to run out in 2014, much
earlier than previously anticipated.
Activity in this sector accounts for
70 percent of exports, 15 percent of
domestic government revenue, and
10 percent of GDP. Committed aid flows,
currently about 35 percent of GDP, are
also expected to decline.

II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
6.
Economic growth remained satisfactory in 2006. Real GDP rose an estimated
6 percent: nonlogging growth accelerated to 6 percent, driven by fish, palm oil production,
and services (Figure 1). Logging continued broadly at the same level as in 2005, over four
times the sustainable rate. The current account deficit widened slightly to 26 percent of GDP,
mainly reflecting higher fuel and
20
investment-related imports (Table 2 and 20 Inflation in PICs (In percent)
Figure 2).1 Continued strong aid inflows

and 4, Figures 3 and 4). Due to this and

New customs trade data, which have become available in 2006, show much higher imports than previously
measured from foreign exchange transactions. Also, the new aid survey covering cash and noncash aid flows
has revealed that aid flows have been significantly higher than previously estimated by staff.

7
receding oil prices, inflation decelerated to 7½ percent, but remains the highest among the
Pacific Island Countries (PICs).
7.
Growth is expected to be about 5½ percent in 2007, mostly reflecting a further
escalation in logging. Logging has accelerated by over 50 percent year-on-year in January–
April 2007 and shows no signs of abating given strong international demand, especially from
China. However, nonlogging growth is expected to slow to 3½ percent, as fish and traditional
crops are contracting, while palm oil will contribute about 1 percentage point to overall
growth.2 Despite much higher logging exports, the current account deficit is expected to
widen to 40 percent of GDP due to imports related to the gold mine (17 percent of GDP).
Nevertheless, continued strong aid flows and FDI are expected to keep reserve cover
adequate (Table 5). Inflation is projected to ease to 7 percent.
8.
Absent an acceleration of key reforms, even the modest per capita income
growth recently achieved is unlikely to be sustained over the medium term. In the
baseline scenario, which assumes RAMSI and donor support, an unchanged pace of reforms,
and no new major projects, growth is projected to decline to 1½ percent by 2010 and average
3 percent in 2007–12 (nonlogging at about 3¾ percent), compared to population growth rate
of almost 3 percent (Table 6). Although aid inflows—most of which are channeled outside
the budget—are projected to fall by half, the effect on growth is likely to be limited because
the decline will affect mostly technical assistance (representing over 60 percent of total) as
capacity improves. Logging is projected to remain broadly at the current rate until 2009 and
decline sharply thereafter. With project-related imports falling sharply once the rehabilitation
of the gold mine is completed, the start of gold exports from 2008 and the planned expansion
of palm oil production should help narrow the current account deficit considerably over the
medium term, notwithstanding the decline of logging and diminishing aid flows. The reserve
import cover is expected to fall, but remain above three months (Table 7).

The April tsunami is expected to have a negligible impact on growth. Logging remained unscathed; tourism is
not a main growth source; and rebuilding activities could provide some stimulus.

Risks to the baseline scenario remain tilted to the downside. Potential risks stem
mainly from: political instability, disruption to law and order, slippages in fiscal discipline,
and interruptions in aid flows. Adverse shocks to commodity prices also remain a significant
risk, given the highly-concentrated commodity export base.

stronger export growth partly offset by
more imports. Higher fiscal revenue from expanding nonlogging activities and a
comprehensive tax reform would create space for more government spending. Samoa and
Mauritius provide clear examples of the growth benefits that can result from well-targeted
reforms in small island economies. In the Solomon Islands, the rise in foreign investment
applications since the new Investment Act came into force suggests that accelerating reforms
along the lines discussed below could quickly translate into higher investment and growth.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
11.
The authorities are aware of the need to generate higher nonlogging growth, but
an overarching development strategy is lacking. Given the urgency of replacing logging,
the authorities plan to facilitate investment in sectors that take advantage of the country’s
natural resources and low-cost labor, such as fishing, mining, palm oil, and tourism. They
added that reforms to encourage more sustainable forestry management would become
feasible once alternative growth sources have taken off. Yet, they recognized that there is still
a need to adopt a country-led poverty reduction and growth (PRS) strategy that clearly
identifies priorities, sequencing, implementable actions linked to budgets, and evaluation
mechanisms.
12.
In the face of impending fiscal pressures and growth challenges, discussions
centered on immediate policy priorities to facilitate faster sustainable development. As
the authorities broadly agreed with the medium-term outlook, the focus was on measures to:
(i) maintain fiscal discipline and create additional fiscal space for priority spending within a
medium-term framework; and (ii) make progress on implementing key structural reforms that
would ease binding constraints to higher private sector-led growth.

discretionary exemptions. Also, for the first
time since 2003, reference prices of logs were raised. However, more than in previous years,
revenue overperformance and investment underspending compared to the budget will be
offset by higher spending on wages and goods and services. Current spending is projected to
surge by 29 percent compared to a 20 percent increase in domestic revenue. This risks
stoking inflation pressures and ignores looming medium-term challenges. The authorities
argued that some expansion is warranted, especially in the social sectors and on wages, as the
average civil service wage remains low.

spending; and (v) debt repayments and
arrears settlement. Also, the authorities stated that, while spending on health and education is
high by cross-country comparisons, there is pent-up demand for higher social spending.
15.
A medium-term budget framework would help manage fiscal pressures and
ensure further progress toward debt sustainability. Though declining, public sector debt
remains uncomfortably high and contingent liabilities could rise (see below). With
government deposits the only source of financing, and given debt repayments and the
projected revenue path absent comprehensive tax reform, current expenditure would need to
be reduced by some 3 percentage points of GDP, starting in 2008, to keep the primary
domestic surplus at around ½ percent of GDP over the medium term and thereby reduce

10
debt.3 The authorities agreed to avoid new borrowing for now and noted that the 2008 budget
will be more forward-looking and prioritize expenditure better. However, they stated that
spending cuts would be implemented only if revenues weaken. Staff cautioned that delaying
the adjustment will make it more abrupt and possibly result in undue cuts in priority
spending.
16.
Additional revenue efforts are planned. While revenues have increased sharply, the
effective import duty rate has declined to under 4 percent reflecting weak collection from
customs, and reference prices of logs remain about 50 percent below international prices
resulting in foregone annual revenue of around 3 percentage points of GDP. The authorities
are upgrading systems and skills in customs to improve revenue collection. The Minister of
Finance also committed to raising reference log prices by a further 20 percent by mid-year
and adopting an automatic price adjustment mechanism to prevent future deviations from
market prices. The registration of businesses is a welcome step toward a broad-based
consumption tax which the authorities may introduce in the longer term.
17.
Strengthened expenditure control and efficiency are necessary to maintain
financial stability and improve service delivery. The rapid growth in spending over the last
few years reflects the resumption of government operations after the conflict, but at around
33 percent of GDP current expenditures are significantly higher than in most LICs. Better
expenditure allocation would create fiscal space for higher development spending as aid
dependence is reduced, and on operations and maintenance as ongoing projects are
completed. The authorities agreed that a system that links budget allocations to agencies’
performance in achieving policy outcomes would be highly desirable.
18.
The high and rising civil service wage bill calls for tighter payroll control and
improved service delivery. The recent Special Audit Report on the Treasury Payroll has
recommended critical measures including improving the monitoring of entry, exit, and
attendance rates, and achieving closer coordination between Ministries, the Public Service
and Teachers’ Commissions, and the Treasury payroll. In addition, to improve incentives for
better service delivery and move toward a leaner and more responsive civil service, the wage
structure should be decompressed and preparations for the adoption of a performance-based
remuneration system started. A census and functional review of the civil service would also
set the stage for a comprehensive reform. The authorities agreed to tighten internal controls
and practices related to the payroll, but emphasized that rebuilding a stronger middlemanagement is key to improving civil service performance.

3

This adjustment is larger-than-previously recommended due to the sharper projected decline in logging
revenue, partially compensated by gold revenues.

Budget preparation is improving, but public financial management could be
strengthened. The 2007 Budget contained more accurate information on aid flows and
included some donor-funded health spending. For the 2008 Budget, the Expenditure Review
sub-committee of the Cabinet (ERC) has been set up to agree early on key expenditure
priorities, take into account recurrent costs of projects, and integrate more closely the
recurrent and development budgets. The authorities are reviewing the revised Finance
Instructions that would enhance expenditure control and accountability. Staff also considered
that the appointment of an accountant-general is necessary to reinvigorate public financial
management reform. These improvements, together with the adoption of a PRS and
improved capacity, would also set the stage for the gradual integration of more aid into the
budget.
20.
The authorities agreed that

above the Board-endorsed threshold (Supplement I). The authorities hoped that additional
relief would result from the review of the Honiara Club agreement soon to be concluded by
one major creditor.4 In the baseline scenario, assuming no new borrowing, all debt indicators

decline below thresholds in 2009. However, debt would rise sharply with even a temporary
decline in export and GDP growth or a return of growth and the primary balance to historical
levels. Moreover, most contingent liabilities (14 percent of GDP at end-2006) are likely to
materialize and more could arise, given the SOEs’ weak financial positions.
21.
The authorities did not share the staff’s sense of urgency in tackling the SOEs’
difficulties. Several SOEs continue to incur arrears, depend on government support, provide
poor services, and some have borrowed commercially. The bulk of identified contingent
liabilities relate to the Solomon Islands Electricity Authority (SIEA) and the Water Authority
(SIWA). However, the management contracts for the two utilities, recommended by the
World Bank and long in the works, have yet to be tendered. Privatization plans for Solomon
Airlines have been shelved. The authorities agreed that SOEs should operate on a more
commercial basis and pointed to their plans to update accounts, introduce a new bill to
improve governance, and increase private participation, but emphasized their social benefits.
Staff cautioned that SOEs should not borrow until their finances have stabilized and
suggested that the government should make any support more transparent and conditional on
performance improvements. Steps toward the privatization of the marina and the fishing
company are welcome, provided transparent tender procedures are used. Finally, the
authorities could not commit to the liquidation of the DBSI, even though several
commercially-based schemes to extend access to financial services in rural areas are being
implemented.5
22.
The NPF’s profitability is improving, but the government attaches low priority
to the new bill. After successful asset recovery and restructuring, the NPF’s nonperforming
assets are estimated to have declined to below 10 percent, and its net operational income to
assets ratio rose to 4 percent in 2006 from 1½ percent in 2005. The NPF is also increasing its
investments abroad, which should boost returns without undue risks, provided the newlyapproved guidelines are applied conservatively. However, the government’s proposal that the
NPF acquire the Solomon Islands Home Finance Limited (SIHFL) could have an adverse
effect if a significant share of SIHFL’s assets are impaired. The authorities explained that
SIHFL would become a subsidiary to which the existing NPF’s housing loans would be
transferred and would be managed at arms’ length, allowing the NPF to concentrate on
generating higher returns for its contributors. Staff countered that passage of the NPF bill is
needed to clarify the NPF’s objectives, improve governance, and ensure investment decisions
are commercially based, but the authorities commented that political support for the bill is
weak.

A rural and small businesses credit scheme is administered by commercial banks and the government’s
guarantee is capped. Also, the government is providing capital transfers for additional mobile banks and ATMs.

13
B. Structural Reforms
23.
The authorities noted advances on several fronts of the reform agenda, while
staff stressed that a sharper focus on the binding constraints to growth could yield
higher payoffs. Although some progress on structural reforms has been achieved, capacity
constraints, entrenched vested interests, and infrequent parliamentary sessions have
contributed to delays (Table 9). Staff encouraged the authorities to better target reforms, as
tackling many problems simultaneously can lead to poor sequencing and prioritization, and
further burden weak implementation capacity.
24.
Staff analysis suggests that low investment returns pose critical obstacles to
growth. Low social returns stem mainly from high costs of doing business—in particular,
costly and unreliable utilities, weak transport infrastructure, and shortages of skilled labor
(Box 1). The low share of returns that accrues to private investors appears related to
governance issues, including opaque rules, perceptions that the government can exercise
discretion and renege on previous commitments, and uncertainties surrounding land tenure.
Lack of financing does not seem to be a binding constraint given the excess liquidity in the
banking system and strong aid inflows.
25.
Improving utilities, transportation, and the predictability of the investment
environment are critical elements in fostering private sector growth. The authorities
agreed with the need to improve the operations of SIEA and SIWA, but the timeframe for the
management contracts remains unclear. Attempts to introduce competition in the
telecommunications sector have led to reduced telephone costs, but legal procedures have
stalled the process. The road network is being upgraded with the Asian Development Bank’s
assistance, but airline and shipping services remain unreliable. Staff also underscored the
importance of maintaining clearly-defined and transparent rules, minimizing the use of
negotiated tax agreements and exemptions for individual investors, and improving the
commercial dispute resolution system. The authorities pointed to improvements in the
business environment with the new Investment Act and streamlined work and residency
permits procedures, and also noted their plans to eliminate provincial business licenses and
modernize the Companies’ Act. They added that land tenure problems cut across all sectors,
but reforms will take time.
C. Exchange Rate and Monetary Policies
26.
Competitiveness appears adequate, but wage increases could erode it. The real
effective exchange rate (REER) appreciated slightly in 2005–06 and export shares increased
somewhat. Despite a decline in 2006, growth in nonlogging export volumes has been robust
in recent years and is expected to increase with the start of gold exports in 2008 and
continued expansion of palm oil production, contributing to over half of the decline in the
current account deficit over the medium term. Furthermore, the recent high volatility of
nonlogging exports does not appear related to competitiveness. Nevertheless, the profitability

14
Box 1. Identifying Binding Constraints to Growth
The Solomon Islands face certain unavoidable impediments to growth as a result of remoteness and sparse
population, but other constraints could be addressed through structural reforms.
The Hausmann, Rodrik, and Velasco diagnostic framework6 is used to identify which among the following
general constraints are binding: (i) inadequate returns to investment; (ii) low private sector share of investment
returns (appropriability); and (iii) inadequate access to finance. It then asks which factors lead to these
problems. In the Solomon Islands, poor investment returns and low appropriability seem the most relevant
constraints as evidenced by high business costs and poor governance and predictability of government rules.

Business Costs
The Solomon Islands ranks 69th out of 175 countries in the World Bank’s (WB) cost of doing business
indicators, one of the highest in the region. The Asian Development Bank (AsDB) and WB reports and
interviews with firms point to lack of infrastructure, expensive and unreliable transport, high electricity and
communications costs, land issues, a burdensome regulatory system, and scarce skilled labor as major problems.
For instance, high electricity costs have a large impact on the gold mine’s investment decisions and both the
gold mine and the palm oil company are seeking alternative power-generating options since the state-owned

Low Private Appropriability
The findings of the AsDB’s private sector assessment report corroborate the widely-held view that corruption is
endemic. The country is at the lowest quintile on the WB’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment ranking
and scores the lowest in the region in the Kauffman Rule of Law Index. Low private returns are also associated
with poor contract enforcement and uncertainties surrounding land tenure, given that more than 80 percent of
the land is customarily-owned. A WB survey of contract enforcement ranks the Solomon Islands 102nd out of
175 countries.

The staff continued to support
the current exchange rate policy.
Amid strong aid and FDI inflows, the
CBSI has stabilized the value of the SI
dollar against the U.S. dollar. As
projects financed by these inflows are
implemented, reserves should be
allowed to decline. Should downward
pressure on the exchange rate
materialize from other sources, the
exchange rate should be allowed to
adjust since the current policy
framework could not support a pegged
exchange rate. The staff added that
domestic policy slippages should be
countered with financial tightening.

The CBSI remains committed to counter inflationary pressures if they resurface.
Inflation has moderated, but could be rekindled by wage increases, donor spending, and rapid
credit expansion, especially given supply constraints. The CBSI indicated that measures
would be introduced if inflation exceeds 10 percent for three consecutive months or if
reserves come under pressure. The staff recommended a more forward-looking approach by
taking action as soon as the inflation outlook deteriorates. The planned offshore investments
of the NPF and the CBSI’s remunerated standing deposit facilities would help absorb excess
liquidity and strengthen monetary management. If action is needed before the standing
deposit facilities are introduced, the CBSI would have to resort to raising reserve
requirements or introducing credit ceilings. Developing additional market-based instruments
as the treasury bill market evolves would also be desirable.
29.
The CBSI considered that risks related to rapid credit growth are contained.
Credit to the private sector has nearly doubled since 2005, driven by loans to personal,
forestry, and distribution sectors, but financial intermediation remains low by regional
standards. Moreover, banks’ credit appraisals appear cautious, most lending is collateralized,
and capital adequacy ratios are above the 10 percent prudential norm. However, the CBSI

D. Statistical Issues
30.
Some measures are being taken to address serious deficiencies in statistics, which
hamper surveillance. The National Statistics Office has recently published a Household
Income and Expenditure Survey which will be used to rebase GDP and calculate a national
consumer price index (Annex VI). However, SOEs’ accounts are still lacking, monitoring of
the MDGs is weak, and balance of payments statistics are poor.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
31.
Macroeconomic stability will likely be sustained in the near term, but political
uncertainty and an acceleration in logging have heightened the economy’s vulnerability.
With RAMSI and donor engagement, financial stability should continue, but the tensions of
7

nonresident banks. Currently, the single customer exposure limit applies to the capital of the parent bank.

18
the past year have highlighted that even the fragile stability achieved so far cannot be taken
for granted. Also, the recent escalation in logging has brought forward the exhaustion of the
natural forest and intensified the urgency of generating alternative sources of growth to
prevent living standards from falling.
32.
Medium-term challenges require a more integrated and forward-looking
approach to economic reform and immediate action. Progress on structural reforms is
welcome, but limited. The country needs a medium-term national development strategy that
can serve as the umbrella framework for all programs and projects, which should achieve
enhanced policy and aid effectiveness. Also, pressures on the budget in the medium term are
almost certain to intensify due to lower logging revenues and aid inflows and higher
infrastructure and maintenance spending. Now is a propitious time to accelerate reforms,
given the degree of macroeconomic stability achieved and the current favorable international
backdrop.
33.
A medium-term budget framework that explicitly recognizes future pressures
and financing constraints and continues to make progress toward debt sustainability is
urgently needed. Public sector debt remains at high risk of distress. The NPV of external
debt to GDP is projected to fall below the Board-endorsed threshold only in 2009 and several
shocks could interrupt the declining trend of recent years. Hence, the government should
sustain its efforts to regularize debt and uphold its policy of no new borrowing at least until
all debt indicators fall below the thresholds.
34.
With the 2007 Budget too expansionary, the likely overperformance on revenue
should be saved and current expenditure kept strictly within budget. Saving a large
share of the overperformance would ease the transition until new sources of revenue come on
stream when logging falls, or could be used to reduce debt or cushion shocks. This policy
would also contribute to contain inflation pressures.
35.
Adjusting the reference prices of logs could provide a powerful signal of the
government’s commitment to additional revenue reform. This year’s increase is
welcome, but reference log prices should be raised further without delay and an automatic
price adjustment mechanism introduced. Strides taken in broadening the tax base are
commendable and preparations for introducing a VAT should continue. The results obtained
by the inland revenue suggest that better administration can raise revenue substantially,
something that has yet to happen on the customs side.
36.
Enhanced expenditure control, composition, and efficiency should be key
elements of the fiscal strategy. Recent increases in current expenditure cannot be sustained
and will have to be partly reversed over the medium term. The wage bill is high and
continues to rise, while domestically-financed investment spending remains low. Not only
should generalized wage increases be avoided and future increases linked to skills and
performance to boost service delivery, but tighter payroll controls should be implemented

19
immediately. The setting up of the ERC sub-committee should help improve expenditure
prioritization and implementation of investment projects. Strengthening public financial
management remains at the core of ensuring efficient and accountable use of public funds.
37.
Vigorously pursuing SOE reform and strengthening the NPF are crucial to
minimize future contingent liabilities to the budget and strengthen governance. The
implementation of the SIEA and SIWA management contracts would provide a convincing
signal of the authorities’ commitment, and consideration should be given to the
commercialization of Solomon Airlines. As recommended in previous consultations, the
DBSI should be liquidated. Passage of the NPF bill is required to enhance governance, which
holds the key to raising profitability. Even before the bill is passed, the authorities should
continue to work toward increasing the risk-adjusted returns on the NPF’s assets by ensuring
investment decisions follow purely commercial criteria.
38.
Reforms focused on removing binding constraints to growth are likely to attain
higher payoffs. Lowering the costs and improving service delivery of the utilities, together
with continuing to upgrade transport infrastructure, would raise investment returns.
Maintaining a level playing field would give investors greater certainty that they can recoup a
higher share of their investment returns.
39.
The level of competitiveness appears adequate and the present exchange rate
policy remains appropriate. Despite a slight appreciation of the REER in 2005–06,
nonlogging export growth is expected to accelerate in the next few years with increasing
palm oil production and gold coming on stream. However, substantial increases in the
minimum wage would be detrimental. Stabilizing the exchange rate as inflows continue to be
strong remains advisable, but should downward pressure on the exchange rate materialize,
the value of the currency should adjust.
40.
The CBSI is gearing up to be in a position to take measures quickly if inflation
picks up. Although inflation has moderated, demand pressures could reignite it. The planned
introduction of standing deposits facilities to absorb the structural excess liquidity in the
system would increase the CBSI’s monetary control and enable it to take quick action if the
inflation outlook deteriorates.
41.
Banks appear generally sound, but prudential measures should be tightened.
Despite the rapid increase in bank credit, financial intermediation is still low and banks
appear to take a conservative approach to lending. Nevertheless, to ensure that asset quality
remains high, the CBSI should intensify its surveillance, tighten loan classification, consider
redefining the single customer exposure limit, and support the introduction of a credit
registry.
42.
The statistical database should continue to be improved. Despite some progress,
the coverage and quality of the data are barely adequate for surveillance. Priority should be

20
given to the new GDP statistics, SOEs’ accounts, monitoring the MDGs, and balance of
payments statistics.
43.

It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the 12-month cycle.

now being captured more accurately, and they indicate much higher levels than previously estimated.
2/ On an accrual basis.
3/ Recurrent costs of projects and from taking over recurrent costs currently funded by donor grants.
4/ Includes transfers for realized contingent liabilities in 2005, 2006, and 2007.
5/ Domestic revenue and recurrent grant budget support minus recurrent expenditure.
6/ Domestic revenue minus noninterest recurrent expenditure and domestically-financed development spending.
7/ Includes interest arrears.

APPENDIX I. SOLOMON ISLANDS: JOINT FUND-BANK DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
(DSA)
Under the medium-term baseline scenario, living standards would fail to rise, and the debt
remains at high risk of distress.1 Assuming macroeconomic stability, but an unchanged reform
pace, growth would average 3 percent. Logging would start detracting significantly from growth
from 2010 after its recent acceleration brought forward the exhaustion of the natural forest.
Although the debt situation has continued to improve, historical scenarios and several stress
tests—even some temporary ones—still lead to a significant rise in the debt burden and cause
several indicators to rise above thresholds.
Appendix Box 2. Medium-Term Baseline Scenario
Under the medium-term baseline scenario,

in 2007-2009, given continued strong
expected demand from China and favorable international prices, after which it drops dramatically and detracts
significantly from growth until the natural forests are exhausted in 2014. After 2014, logging is expected to
contribute only marginally to growth, mainly from plantations. Nonlogging growth is projected at an average
of 3¾ percent in the medium term, and is expected to stabilize at about 3 percent in the long run. Inflation is
projected to ease but would remain at around 5 percent. The real effective exchange rate is assumed to be
constant. Despite the decline in logging exports, the current account deficit is expected to narrow rapidly as
import growth declines given lower official development assistance (ODA) and investment inflows, and as the
gold mine starts production in 2008, but would remain at about 8 percent of GDP. The reserve cover is
projected to fall, but would remain adequate at above 3 months of imports. The budget position would need to
maintain a small surplus due to financing constraints and the desire to avoid abrupt fiscal retrenchment, and to
reduce the high public debt.
Risks to the baseline are tilted to the downside. Potential risks stem mainly from: the country’s history of
political instability, disruption to law and order, slippages in fiscal discipline, donors leaving and interruptions
in aid flows, and adverse exogenous shocks, such as to the terms of trade, given the highly-concentrated
export base. Also, growth and exports have been highly volatile.

Data on private external, state enterprise, and provincial government debt are not available. Therefore, the
analysis is limited to central government debt data.

38
Progress has been achieved in regularizing the debt situation. The Honiara Club initiative
led to a short-term moratorium on principal payments and the forgiveness of interest payments
during the moratorium (0.2 percent of GDP) from one creditor, which expires in 2007, as well
as the possibility of debt forgiveness and arrears settlement after an ongoing review.2 This
analysis, however, does not assume debt forgiveness, but incorporates the impact of the shortterm moratorium and related interest forgiveness. Successful negotiations with an external
commercial creditor achieved debt relief amounting to ½ percent of GDP in July 2006. In
February 2006, agreement was also reached on debt owed to the Central Bank of the Solomon
Islands (CBSI): 25 percent of interest arrears amounting to 0.4 percent of GDP was settled, the
rest was forgiven (1.3 percent of GDP), and outstanding advances were converted into longterm bonds carrying a 2¼ percent interest rate. The stock of arrears to suppliers also fell by
about 1 percentage point of GDP to 1.2 percent of GDP in 2006. These developments helped
bring down total public debt to 73 percent of GDP at end-2006, from 81 percent of GDP in
2005.
Debt Sustainability in the Baseline Scenario
Results of the baseline external debt sustainability analysis are mixed (Appendix
Table 10).3 At end-2006, the NPV of external debt to GDP at 37 percent was higher than its
Board-endorsed threshold, but is expected to fall below it by 2009. This relies critically on
the assumption that the government’s current policy of incurring no new debt will continue.4
All other indicators, including the ratios of the NPV of debt to exports and revenue, and debt
service ratios were below their thresholds, and are expected to decline over time. Although
the starting point of the NPV of external debt to GDP is about the same as earlier projected
for 2006, indicators decline at a slower pace over the medium term due mainly to the lower
projected GDP and the faster decline in logging revenue.
Albeit declining, the overall central government debt remains high (Appendix Table 12).
At end-2006, central government domestic debt including arrears stood at 19 percent of
2

The Honiara Club is a multilateral forum convened by the government in October 2005 to seek debt relief
from its official creditors. Four creditors participated in the Honiara Club, namely, the Export Finance and
Insurance Corporation (EFIC), the European Commission, the European Investment Bank, and the International
Fund for Agricultural Development.

This analysis assumes that the government remains current on all obligations from June 2007, and that all
debts in arrears are treated as a current short-term obligation with NPV equal to its face value. Existing external
arrears are assumed to continue growing with accrued interest.

4

The thresholds (see Appendix Table 10) apply to countries with weak policies and institutions, and are
discussed in Operational Framework for Debt Sustainability Analysis in Low Income Countries—Further
Considerations. Albeit improving, the Solomon Islands’ 3-year average CPIA at 2.5 remains the lowest among
the Pacific Island Countries.

39
GDP, from its 2003 peak of 51 percent. In 2007, this is expected to decline further to
16.3 percent of GDP, partly reflecting the settlement of most remaining informal arrears and
the continuing repayment of existing debt as scheduled. Nevertheless, total central
government debt would still be 42 percent of GDP in 2012, and the NPV of public sector
debt to revenue ratio stays above 100 percent until 2011.
Risks to the debt dynamics
Historical scenarios and even some temporary stress tests demonstrate the country’s
vulnerable debt position (Appendix Tables 11 and 13).
•

External Debt: Key variables at their historical averages set the NPV of external debt
to exports on a rising path as historical averages for real GDP and export growth are
close to zero, and the 10-year average of non-debt creating flows is significantly
below recent levels. The export shock (bound test B2) is the most extreme stress test
for the NPV of debt to export and NPV of debt service to export ratios due to the high
volatility of exports. Even a temporary decline in export growth to its historical
average increases the NPV of debt to exports to twice its threshold. The most extreme
stress test for the NPV of debt to GDP ratio is the temporary reversion to historical
averages, minus one half a standard deviation, of real GDP growth, export growth,
the U.S. dollar GDP deflator, and net non-debt creating flows (bound test B4). If all
recognized contingent liabilities are realized (14 percent of GDP), the NPV of
external debt to GDP would exceed 30 percent of GDP until 2015.

•

Public Debt: Lower GDP growth, even temporarily, and a return of growth and the
primary balance to their historical averages causes the NPV of public debt to GDP
and revenue ratios to rise dramatically. The most extreme stress test, which assumes a
temporary decline in GDP growth to its historical average less one standard deviation,
almost triples the current level of the NPV of public debt to revenue ratio.

These tests seem especially relevant given the country’s volatile economic and political
history, poor credit history, and mixed progress in key areas of the reform agenda.
These results are indicative given major uncertainties surrounding important variables.
Macroeconomic variables (especially GDP) are subject to large measurement errors. ODA
plans are uncertain and contingent liabilities are likely to increase as the SOEs’ financial
situation remains poor.
The authorities should sustain their efforts to regularize debt and uphold the policy of
no new borrowing at least until all indicators fall below the thresholds. In view of
impending fiscal pressures from declining logging revenues and aid, and the need to sustain
progress towards debt sustainability, the authorities should maintain fiscal prudence, continue
to work towards clearing all arrears, retain the policy of no new borrowing, and anchor fiscal

40
policy to a medium-term framework. Vigorously pursuing SOE reform and strengthening the
National Provident Fund will also be necessary to minimize future contingent liabilities to
the budget.

Exchange Rate Arrangements:
Since November 2000, the exchange rate for the Solomon Islands (SI) dollar has been based
on an undisclosed trade-weighted basket of the currencies of the Solomon Islands’ major
trading partners, with the U.S. dollar as the intervention currency. During 2002, as pressures
on external reserves intensified, the Central Bank of Solomon Islands (CBSI) accelerated the
rate of currency depreciation, leading to a gradual real depreciation of the SI dollar. Since
December 2002, the CBSI has kept the exchange rate broadly stable against the U.S. dollar,
although there is no public commitment to continue to do so. The Solomon Islands now

3
maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers for current international transactions.

Last Article IV Consultation:
The 2006 Article IV Consultation discussions were held in Honiara during June 8–June 20,
2006. The staff report (IMF Country Report No. 06/362, August 30, 2006) was considered by
the Executive Board and the consultation concluded on October 4, 2006.

Tax Administration and Policy
A mission in May 2004 designed plans to modernize and enhance the efficiency of the
Customs and Tax Divisions. A further mission in May 2005 reviewed the current system,
outlined a detailed strategy for the implementation of tax reforms over the next few years,
and assessed the required technical assistance to support this strategy. The authorities
released a tax reform proposal in conformity with PFTAC’s advice. A mission in February
2006 assisted the government further with a detailed implementation plan, including
discussions on the policy and design issues in relation to the VAT, income tax, and revenue
administration. With assistance from LEG, draft legislation was prepared for the VAT and
Revenue Administration Acts. In December 2006, a mission assisted the authorities in the
preparation of a high-level design and project plan for the implementation of the Business
Revenue Reform, and a follow-up visit took place in early May 2007. However, the
government’s revenue policy remains to be finalized.
Public Financial Management
In May 2006, the PFTAC adviser undertook a review of the Public Finance and Audit Act
(PFAA; 1978), the Financial Instructions (FI; 1978) and the Stores Instructions (1976; SIs).
The mission agreed with the authorities that the more immediate need was for a process
redesign of the key accounting operations, linked to a significant redraft of the FI. In August
2006, a mission recommended measures to improve accounting operations and installed two
consultants to redraft the FI. A final report was sent to the authorities in January 2007.
Financial Sector Regulation and Supervision
In September 2004, an advisor visited the CBSI to advise on the implementation of an antimoney laundering regime. A peripatetic advisor visited in January 2005 to assist with
improving the CBSI’s bank supervision department’s database. In April 2005, the PFTAC
advisor worked with an MCM expert to provide assistance in dealing with a failed insurance
company and developing a supervisory framework for insurance companies, provided advice
on the oversight of the National Provident Fund, developed supervisory guidelines on

AML/CFT activities in financial institutions, and prepared a project document for the
establishment of the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU). In September 2005, the PFTAC
advisor assisted CBSI staff in conducting an AML/CFT on-site examination of a domestic
bank. CBSI staff also attended a seminar on monetary policy in shallow markets arranged by
PFTAC/MFD in March 2005. In February 2006, the advisor participated in an AML/CFT
awareness training seminar conducted by the CBSI. In November 2006, the CBSI hosted the
annual meeting of the Association of the Financial Supervisors of Pacific Countries.
Economic and Financial Statistics
During 2003, the National Statistics Office (NSO) restarted activity, with the production of
the Honiara CPI. A joint PFTAC/Secretariat of the Pacific Community mission in February
2004 devised a recovery plan, and AusAID and NZAID provided funding for equipment and
a long-term advisor (a former PNG deputy statistician) to help build capacity and also to
coordinate the Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES). The CBSI compiles
balance of payments and GDP data and CBSI staff attended a regional training course on
balance of payments statistics arranged by PFTAC in April 2005. Missions in August 2005
and February 2006 reviewed current methodologies for balance of payments and national
accounts statistics and suggested some short-term improvements to their compilation.
Assistance was also provided on a prototype government finance statistics system. In
September 2006, the NSO released the findings of the 2005/06 HIES. Over the February–
March 2007 period, PFTAC experts assisted the authorities in improving the compilation of
balance of payments statistics and revising the GDP data.

III. SOLOMON ISLANDS—RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
(As of June 2007)

Since becoming a Bank member in June 1978, the Solomon Islands has received eight IDA
credits totaling US$50 million in the infrastructure, education, health, finance, and
agriculture sectors. Following the repayment of all outstanding arrears in September 2003,
the Solomon Islands came out of nonaccrual status, and country relations have normalized.
The Solomon Islands is eligible for an IDA 14 allocation of SDR 7.3 million (indicative
only) over FY 2006–08. The IDA allocation for FY 07 is SDR 5.2 million.
The Bank’s assistance to the Solomon Islands is motivated by the need for re-engagement in
a low capacity post-conflict country, while recognizing the abundance of donor funds. The
assistance program is guided by the government’s own development priorities articulated in
the National Economic Reform, Recovery, and Development Plan (2003–06), and the Bank’s
broader Pacific Regional Strategy which has a focus on: (i) strengthening government
capabilities, and (ii) improving incentives for the private sector. The Bank’s involvement in
the Solomon Islands is in the following areas:
Strengthening Government Capabilities
•

Health Sector: The government has initiated preparatory steps to move toward a sectorwide approach (SWAp) in the health sector, consistent with the direction that AusAID, as
main donor to the sector, is also moving as indicated in the recent AusAID’s White Paper
on development aid. IDA is exploring options for its engagement to strengthen the health
sector, including technical assistance, sector policy analysis and advice, and IDA grant
funding (US$2 million), if there is a financing gap in the health program.

•

Education SWAp: The Bank has co-financed a study to support the development of a
National Skills Training Plan. The government has indicated interest in joining the
Education for All Fast Track Initiative (FTI) and the process to prepare the Ministry of
Education for participation has begun. It is hoped that with technical assistance, a costed
sector strategy will be developed by late 2007 and formal FTI participation would begin
in 2008. Any funding that the Bank provides for FTI activities would become part of the
ongoing SWAp, which is currently financed only by the EU and NZAID.

•

Energy Supply: The Bank is supporting the government’s decision to implement a
structural reform program in the electricity sector in order to improve electricity supplies,
reduce their dependence on diesel-fired electricity generation, and provide affordable
rural electricity systems. The government has determined that the best way to improve
the performance of the Solomon Islands Electricity Authority (SIEA) is to contract out
SIEA’s management for five years through a performance based management contract.
The management contract will provide the skills necessary to improve SIEA’s

8
commercial management as well as providing SIEA with the specialist expertise it
requires to implement a proposed rural electrification program and a program to convert
the outer islands diesel systems to bio-diesel. A management contract will also allow
local managers to receive the training they require to resume full control of SIEA by the
end of the contract. The procurement process has commenced with the appointment of a
procurement advisor to the government funded by AusAid. The management contract is
expected to commence by end-2007. The Bank has also included the Solomon Islands in
a regional renewable energy project to be financed by the GEF.
•

Water Sector: The Bank has prepared a Financial Restructuring Plan (FRP) for the
Solomon Islands Water Authority (SIWA). The report provides the government and
SIWA Board with an overview of SIWA’s financial position and recommends that the
management contract for the SIEA be extended to cover SIWA.

•

Rural Growth: The Bank has completed the Agriculture and Rural Development
Strategy (ARDS) which has been disseminated within the country. In parallel, the Bank
has also started the preparation of the Solomon Islands Rural Development Project
(RDP), which would be co-financed by the EU and AusAID, and implements the main
recommendations of the ARDS.

Improving Incentives for the Private Sector
•

Telecommunications Sector: Τhe Bank is providing technical assistance to the
government to examine ways to improve the competitiveness of the sector to reduce
telecommunication costs and improve the service quality and coverage. Specifically,
the Bank has provided technical assistance to the government to: (i) assess the
telecommunication sector and offer the government strategic options for reform;
(ii) prepare and implement a new telecommunication code; and (iii) provide the
government with options to change the license granted to Solomon Telekom. The
Bank will continue to assist the government to pass a modern telecommunications
code (a good draft has been produced) to prepare for competition in the sector and
good sector regulation. The Bank is ready to assist the government to manage the
transition from a monopoly to competition if the management of Solomon Telekom is
willing to renegotiate the exclusive license.

•

Foreign and Domestic Investment: The Foreign Investment Advisory Service
(FIAS) has provided assistance to the government for the preparation of new foreign
investment legislation and is assisting with a review of investment incentives and
administrative barriers to business.

IV. SOLOMON ISLANDS—RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of June 2007)
Since joining AsDB in 1973, Solomon Islands has received 16 loans amounting to
$79.3 million, and 58 technical assistance (TA) projects amounting to $13.85 million. In
2006, AsDB also approved an Asian Development Fund (ADF) grant in the amount of
$350,000. The last AsDB loan—Post-Conflict Emergency Rehabilitation Project (PCERP)—
was approved in 2000. Solomon Islands is eligible for the Asian Development Fund (ADF)
grants available to countries that are very poor, heavily indebted, or in a post-conflict
situation. The 2005–06 ADF allocation for Solomon Islands succeeded in catalyzing
substantial bilateral grant cofinancing for the improvement of rural roads.
AsDB’s country assistance strategy seeks to achieve rapid, pro-poor, private sector-led
economic growth, and focuses on improving transportation infrastructure and services and
the enabling business environment. Capacity development and the promotion of good
governance are priorities. AsDB assistance is provided entirely on a grant basis and, in line
with government policy, no new lending to the country will be provided until public finances
stabilize. The Country Strategy and Program Update 2007–09 can be found at
www.adb.org/Documents/CSPs/SOL/2006.
AsDB has committed substantial support to the country in response to a strong earthquake
and consequent tsunami on April 2, 2007, which caused significant damage in Choiseul and
Western Provinces. AsDB supports the recovery and rehabilitation of the affected areas
through disaster risk management advisory support to the Government, and assistance for the
rehabilitation of damaged infrastructure to be accommodated within existing projects and a
proposed ADF grant funded emergency project.
AsDB currently has five ongoing TA projects in the areas of institutional strengthening of the
Ministry of Infrastructure and Development, inter-island transportation, state-owned
enterprise reform and private sector participation, companies law, trustee law, companies
registration, and secured transactions reform. AsDB’s ongoing PCERP loan helps rehabilitate
roads and bridges on Guadalcanal and Malaita that were damaged during the conflict. The
Solomon Islands Road Improvement Project, approved in 2006 as an ADF grant with
significant bilateral grant cofinancing, helps rehabilitate roads and bridges throughout the
country to improve rural residents’ access to markets and economic and social services,
promote private sector-led development, foster market formation, and facilitate domestic and
international trade and income and employment opportunities.
AsDB’s Pacific Liaison and Coordination Office in Sydney is responsible for country
programming, project implementation and administration, supported by the Pacific
Operations Division in Manila.

V. SOLOMON ISLANDS—POVERTY AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT INDICATORS
Social indicators of poverty and human development remain low in the Solomon Islands. The
country ranks 128 out of 177 countries in the 2006 United Nations Human Development
Index, below all Pacific island countries, except Papua New Guinea. There are few recent
poverty statistics, but anecdotal evidence suggests poverty remains high. However, the more
extreme forms of poverty, such as malnourishment, have remained limited due to an
abundant resource base, assured access to customary land tenure, and resilient social
networks. This advantage is under pressure from a population growth rate that, at about
3 percent a year, is among the highest in the world.2
Results of the 2005–06 HIES indicate that majority of the population do not have access to
basic services such as electricity and water. For example, 86 percent of the population uses
open fire for cooking, 80 percent relies on kerosene lamps as primary source of energy, and
78 percent does not have water piped into their household.
Nonetheless, the Solomon Islands has achieved some progress in improving living conditions
since independence despite falling per capita incomes. Prior to the civil conflict in 1999,
sizable health and education expenditures (at 3–5 percent of GDP each) and high per capita
aid inflows had helped underpin these improvements. Providing widespread and quality
education to the very young population (45 percent under age 15) is a challenge. The primary
education enrollment ratio is about 95 percent, although primary education is not
compulsory. The enrollment ratio is only 30 percent in secondary education. Concerning
health, malaria is rampant, with the highest rate of infection in the world outside of subSaharan Africa, and a third of the rural population lacks access to safe water.
The paucity of data makes an assessment of human development trends since 1999 difficult,
but anecdotal evidence suggests that pro-poor services delivery is improving. The positive
trend was likely either halted or reversed during the civil conflict. While the conflict sharply
reduced agricultural production for market (due to the lack of security and transport
services), this has recovered since mid-2003 and service delivery has been enhanced.
The aggregate social indicators mask large differences between urban and rural areas. The
two main problems in the rural sector are the lack of essential public services such as health
and education, and cash income due to difficulties in market access for rural products. While
the urban areas have better social services and average incomes are higher, the urban poor
face difficulties in securing employment and land for residence.

2

The 2005–06 HIES estimates the average population growth rate at 4.4 percent, but the authorities are
disputing this.

13
The government has committed to monitor progress towards the Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs). Achieving the MDGs by 2015 is still possible, but remains a major
challenge. Progress in some areas, such as reducing malaria incidence, maternal mortality,
and ensuring environmental sustainability, has so far been inadequate.

VI. SOLOMON ISLANDS—STATISTICAL ISSUES
The economic and financial database is poor, which significantly hampers surveillance,
particularly for the real, fiscal, and external sectors. Although the National Statistics Office
(NSO) is being rebuilt, the central bank (CBSI) continues to publish highly summarized
monetary and price data in its Monthly Economic Bulletin and data on all sectors in its
Quarterly Review and Annual Report. There is a Solomon Islands page in IFS, but significant
updating delays occur, particularly for the balance of payments (BOP), government finance,
and national accounts statistics.
Real Sector Statistics
As the NSO has not produced national accounts data since 1994, the task of preparing GDP
estimates was taken over by the CBSI. GDP estimates are severely hampered by data
availability and quality, and rely on limited sources (primarily commodity exports and
employment estimates). Data on production of major export commodities are reported
monthly. No breakdown of GDP by expenditure categories exists. A survey of business
activities for 2003 covering 1,434 businesses was published by the NSO in August 2006,
including employment and financial data for NSO-registered private and government
business enterprises. The 2004 business survey is still being finalized.
A 2005–06 Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) completed in September
2006 should help strengthen estimation of GDP. A PFTAC advisor in February 2007 rebased
the GDP to 2004 and recalculated the GDP series, but major weaknesses in measuring GDP,
primarily the shortage of informal sector data, severely limit the accuracy of GDP estimates,
which the authorities have not yet adopted.
The NSO resumed production of the CPI (which currently covers only Honiara, the capital)
in August 2003, but the weights are outdated. Using the HIES results, the weights of the
Honiara price index are scheduled to be revised in 2007, and eventually, a national CPI
measure will be estimated. Limited data on total employment can be obtained from the
National Provident Fund. Wage data are not compiled.
Monetary and Financial Statistics (MFS)
The CBSI publishes monthly MFS in summary form and provides more detailed data in its
quarterly and annual reports. Monetary statistics had been reported every two months to
STA, but now reporting has fallen behind. A November 2005 expert mission, during a
PFTAC monetary statistics workshop held in Fiji, reviewed the compilation procedures and
provided training and a work plan for the CBSI to comply with the methodology of the
Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual and to report data using the standardized report
forms (SRFs). However, limited progress has been made on the mission’s recommendations

17
due to the high turnover rate of the CBSI’s monetary statistics team. A PFTAC mission
scheduled for July 2007 will assess the progress in the implementation of the 2005 mission’s
recommendations, introduce the SRFs, and develop an integrated monetary database that will
meet the data needs of the CBSI and the Fund.
Government Finance Statistics (GFS)
The Ministry of Finance (MOF) started monthly press releases on budget outturns in August
2003. However, its expenditure and financing data are not consistent with the GFSM 2001
methodology, and historical data seems unreliable given the breakdown of accounting
mechanisms and large expenditure arrears during the conflict. The NSO has developed a
prototype GFS system, but problems exist in the coverage of the general government. In
particular, data for provincial governments are unavailable and ongoing audits of state
enterprises have yet to be completed. The authorities started collecting disbursement
information on donors’ grants in 2006. The introduction of the Commonwealth Secretariat
Debt Recording and Management System (CS-DRMS) database in the CBSI and MOF in
March 2005 has improved the quality of official debt data, but coordination problems remain.
The MOF does not report annual or subannual GFSM 2001-based data for the Government
Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSY) and the International Financial Statistics (IFS),
respectively.
External Sector Statistics
The CBSI estimates partial quarterly BOP data based on cash foreign exchange transactions
(FET) reported through the banking system, which are available with a three-month lag.
These data are deficient in detail and coverage. A February 2006 PFTAC mission noted a
significant deterioration in the net errors and omission item. In addition, “other items” in
several categories have increased significantly, indicating a deterioration of data quality.
Surveys of enterprises on service and financial flows are conducted to collect supplementary
information, but the response rates are very low. The NSO started publishing merchandise
trade data in 2005 but there are still coverage issues. A mission from New Zealand in
February 2006 began to install PCTrade software in the Customs Department to facilitate the
NSO’s use of Customs data to prepare trade statistics. A February 2007 PFTAC mission
assisted the authorities in further improving compilation of the BOP and international
investment position statistics. The key recommendations were: (i) improve the balance of
payments report forms, (ii) maintain regular contact with the most important respondents,
(iii) improve coverage and classification in the foreign exchange transactions system, and
(iv) further develop the international investment position, including integrating it with other
external sector statistics.

18
Remedial Measures
The NSO is gradually resuming data collection and publication responsibilities, but its
effectiveness continues to be hampered by weak technological skills among its staff and low
survey response rates. A PFTAC GDDS mission in February 2004 concluded that rebuilding
the statistical system will require extensive technical assistance and external funding.
Following its recommendations, a new government statistician was appointed in 2004 and a
long-term social statistics advisor (18 months)—funded by AusAid and NZAid—took up his
post in April 2005. In addition, the NSO and CBSI supported the February 2007 PFTAC
mission’s advice to engage an economic statistics advisor to further strengthen compilation.
The CBSI is planning to host a STA/PFTAC mission in July 2007 to further develop the
monetary statistics.
Preparations for a Demographic and Health Survey started in mid-2006. The Ministry of
Tourism, in coordination with NSO, has started a project to measure tourism spending. A
population census is planned for late 2009, with preparations expected to commence in 2007.
The NSO has requested PFTAC’s assistance to enhance the GFS, and the Secretariat of the
Pacific Community’s (SPC) assistance to rebase the CPI.
The February 2006 PFTAC mission identified a number of statistical issues that require
attention, including: (i) ensuring that compilation methodologies are applied consistently for
GDP and BOP data; and (ii) collecting prices for additional items in the CPI, particularly on
diesel fuel and telecommunications products. In the area of the BOP, there is a need to:
(i) increase the response rate to enterprise surveys to reduce reliance on FET records;
(ii) investigate alternative data to supplement FET data, including the use of official transfers
data from the government’s financial accounts; and (iii) review the Customs merchandise
data.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with the
Solomon Islands
On July 16, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with the Solomon Islands.1
Background
The economy has been recovering since the end of the civil conflict and the intervention of the
Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands (RAMSI) in mid-2003, but the country
remains poor and relies heavily on logging and aid. Over the last four years, economic growth
has averaged 6 percent─although logging is occurring at an unsustainable rate─and financial
stability has been maintained. Large amounts of donor assistance and the restart of two large
projects (gold mine and palm oil plantation) have helped sustain economic activity.
Real GDP growth rose to an estimated 6 percent in 2006, driven by fish, palm oil production,
and services, but is expected to ease to 5½ percent in 2007, as a further escalation in
logging─now running at around five-times the sustainable rate─will be likely offset by lower
growth of fish and traditional crops. The April 2007 tsunami is not expected to have a significant
impact on growth. The current account deficit, which widened slightly to 26 percent of GDP in
2006, mainly reflecting higher fuel and investment-related imports, is expected to increase to
40 percent of GDP in 2007 due to imports related to the refurbishment of the gold mine

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

(17 percent). Nevertheless, continued strong aid flows and foreign direct investment are
expected to keep reserves adequate.
A sizeable overall budget surplus in 2006 helped slow overall monetary growth, as the resulting
contraction in credit to government partly offset continued strong growth in banking sector credit
to the private sector. This moderation in monetary growth, combined with receding oil prices,
helped inflation decelerate to 7½ percent from 8½ percent at end-2005. In 2007, despite a
higher revenue effort, the overall budget surplus is projected to decline to ½ percent of GDP,
reflecting sharply higher spending on wages and goods and services. Thus, while private sector
credit growth is expected to moderate and oil prices stabilize, inflation is projected to ease only
slightly, to 7 percent by end-year.
With the natural forest expected to be depleted within the next few years, structural reforms are
necessary to generate higher sustainable growth, raise living standards, and reduce the
economy’s vulnerability to shocks. However, progress in this area has been mixed. Import
duties were lowered; statutory and discretionary tax exemptions were reduced; reference prices
of logs were raised for the first time since 2003; work permit and immigration procedures were
streamlined; and, with the help of donors, sectoral strategies are being implemented in health,
education, transport, and agriculture. The road network is improving. Against this, little progress
has been made in easing other critical constraints to higher sustainable growth; namely, in
restructuring the utilities, which continue to provide unreliable and costly services and threaten
the budget, and in strengthening governance, which continues to be adversely affected by
opaque rules, the perception that government exercises excessive discretion, and uncertain
land tenure arrangements.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the Solomon Islands’ favorable near-term growth prospects, and
the authorities’ success in maintaining macroeconomic stability since the end of the civil
tensions, and the support of the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands. Directors
supported the authorities’ intention to adopt a medium-term national development strategy,
which once implemented, could help them better cope with the significant challenges ahead.
These include improving the outlook for employment, poverty reduction, and growth, against the
backdrop of rapid depletion of the natural forests due to intensive logging. In that connection,
Directors encouraged the authorities to implement their planned structural reforms to generate
alternative sources of growth in the context of a poverty reduction strategy framework.
Directors commended the recent strengthening of the revenue effort, especially in reducing tax
exemptions and improving tax administration and collection in the Inland Revenue Division, and
the simplification of the import duty structure. They encouraged the authorities to save most of
this year’s expected revenue overperformance. They looked forward to the introduction of an
automatic adjustment mechanism for the reference prices of logs used in calculating export
duties, and to further progress on a comprehensive tax reform. Directors welcomed proposals to
strengthen the budget process and called for efforts to rein in current expenditure in order to
make room for higher spending on high-priority maintenance and infrastructure investments.

3
This should include tighter payroll controls, linking future civil service wage increases to
productivity improvements, and strengthening public financial management.
Looking ahead, Directors encouraged the authorities to adopt a medium-term fiscal framework
to help anchor fiscal policy in the face of impending revenue pressures, assist with the
prioritization of spending, and support the attainment of debt sustainability. They recommended
that the authorities refrain from new borrowing until the sustainability of public debt is well
secured.
Directors supported the central bank’s commitment to restrain inflation and its readiness to
tighten reserve requirements if inflation accelerates. They considered that the introduction of a
standing deposit facility would help absorb some of the excess liquidity and increase the central
bank’s control over monetary aggregates. Looking ahead, Directors recommended that the
authorities develop a more forward-looking and proactive approach to monetary policy, and
supported Fund assistance to develop inflation forecasting capability. Directors agreed that the
banking system appears generally sound, but the continued growth in bank credit calls for
intensified supervision and tightened loan classification.
Directors observed that although the current account deficit is fully financed by aid inflows and
foreign direct investment, close monitoring is called for in view of the large swings in the deficit.
Export competitiveness appears adequate, but Directors cautioned that a large minimum wage
increase—in excess of productivity increases—could weaken labor-intensive exports and
rekindle inflation. Directors supported the current exchange rate policy of stabilizing the
exchange rate against the U.S. dollar, in the light of strong inflows and adequate
competitiveness. However, Directors recommended that the exchange rate be allowed to adjust
downward, if needed, in response to market pressures.
Directors considered that the restructuring of state-owned enterprises, liquidation of the
Development Bank of Solomon Islands, and durable strengthening of the National Provident
Fund will be critical to minimize future contingent liabilities and improve public sector
governance. They encouraged the authorities to implement without further delay the
management contracts for the electricity and water utilities, which should lower costs and
improve service delivery. Continued efforts to improve basic infrastructure should lead to a
better return on investments over the medium term. Directors welcomed recent improvements in
the investment and business environment, and looked forward to further progress, including the
promotion of further governance enhancements.
Directors welcomed recent improvements in the statistical database, and recommended
continued efforts to address weaknesses that complicate the effectiveness of surveillance and
policymaking.
