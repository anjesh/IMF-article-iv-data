STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
January 14, 2015

KEY ISSUES
Context. Mauritania’s economy has benefited from macroeconomic stability and high
growth in the context of contained inflation, responsible macro-policies, high iron ore
prices and scaled-up public investment. However, economic growth has not translated
into broadly improved living standards and is being hit by a sharp decline in iron ore
prices.
Outlook and Risks. Although the outlook remains favorable, it hinges heavily on
stabilizing iron ore prices and expanding mining capacity. Downside risks to the outlook
dominate because iron ore prices may decline further in response to excess supply in the
global market.
Key Policy Recommendations. With high risk of debt distress and deteriorating terms
of trade, Mauritania’s fiscal policy needs to remain focused on consolidation to support
fiscal sustainability. Over the medium term, a fiscal framework with a full-fledged fiscal
rule will help prevent the boom–bust cycles that ensue from volatility in natural resource
revenue, and with strengthened governance in managing mining wealth. The central
bank should take advantage of the low-inflation environment to strengthen monetary
policy formulation, gradually liberalize the foreign exchange market, and introduce
liquidity support and banking resolution frameworks. The implementation of the recent
FSAP recommendations should be pursued to enhance the stability of the financial
sector stability.
Economic diversification and inclusive growth are the foremost medium-term
challenges. The authorities should accelerate structural reforms needed to raise
Mauritania’s potential growth, create jobs, and improve living standards for all
Mauritanians.
Article VIII. A comprehensive analysis of the foreign exchange market identified
exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices (MCPs) subject to Fund approval
under Article VIII. Effective November 20, 2013, the exchange rate regime is classified as
“stabilized” arrangement.

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF MAURITANIA

CONTEXT
1.
With macroeconomic stability restored, Mauritania needs to focus its economic
policies on increasing the economy’s resilience to external shocks and promoting inclusive
growth. With the support of the ECF arrangement (2010–13), the authorities managed to restore
macroeconomic stability with high economic growth, contained inflation, a more prudent fiscal
stance, and improved policy space. Both fiscal and external buffers improved thanks to exceptional
donor assistance, better tax collection, rising iron ore prices, and fishing proceeds. However, a
49 percent decline (year-on-year) in iron ore prices in 2014 again exposed Mauritania’s vulnerability
to terms-of-trade shocks: receipts related to the extractive sector account for 75 percent of exports
and 30 percent of fiscal revenues. The medium-term outlook hinges on the authorities’ capacity to
consolidate macroeconomic stability by strengthening policy formulation and governance;
strengthen the financial sector and promote financial inclusion; and undertake broad structural
reforms to promote private sector development and economic diversification, to broaden and
sustain growth and promote inclusion.
2.
After a double victory in parliamentary and presidential elections, Mauritania’s ruling
party has the political space to undertake renewed economic reforms. The ruling party and its
allies gained a majority in the Parliament, paving the way for legislative economic reforms. President
Abdel Aziz intends to strengthen national unity, the judiciary system, and governance, while
reducing social inequality and poverty through better redistribution.

ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
3.
Economic growth in 2013–14 remained elevated in the context of contained inflation.
Based on the new national accounts,1 real GDP growth is estimated at 5.7 percent in 2013, from
6.0 percent in 2012. Reduced activity in fishing and agricultural sectors was only partly offset by
better mining and services activity. Preliminary economic indicators for the first part of 2014 point to
weaker than expected oil, manufacturing, and agricultural output, partly offset by stronger fishing
and construction activity and higher iron production. Average headline inflation declined from
4½ percent at end-2013 to 3 percent in mid-2014, owing to declining international prices. A spike in
domestic food prices, together with a gas price increase, accelerated average inflation to 4.1 percent
(year-on-year) in October 2014.2
4.
The current account deficit remained wide during 2013–14 because of large capital
imports associated with the extractive sector and, lately, to worsening terms of trade. The
current account deficit reached 25 percent of GDP in 2013, reflecting large imports to expand
capacity in extractive industries—mostly financed by FDI. Reserve levels remained stable

(6½ months of prospective imports excluding those related to the extractive industries). But an
improvement in the terms of trade during 2013 (at 34 percent) reversed during 2014 (at minus
18 percent). During the first half of 2014, the current account deteriorated to an annualized
32 percent from 18 percent of GDP compared to a year earlier, on account of a deteriorating trade
balance.
5.
The deterioration of the terms of trade has been absorbed by lower foreign exchange
reserves. The nominal exchange rate against the U.S. dollar slightly depreciated (by 2 percent) since
end-2012; but appreciated in real terms owing to the inflation differential between Mauritania and
its trading partners. In 2014, the ouguiya continued its gradual depreciation with respect to the
U.S. dollar, with an appreciation of 7 percent vis-à-vis the euro, given the U.S. dollar’s appreciation
relative to the euro. Because the euro is a major trading partner currency, the real effective exchange
rate appreciated cumulatively by about 12 percent since 2013. The Central Bank of Mauritania (CBM)
stepped up its volume of foreign exchange sales in both fixing sessions and direct sales from
US$1.2 billion in 2012 to US$1.5 billion in 2013, and kept a similar trend during 2014 with sales
totaling US$1.5 billion. Weaker foreign exchange repatriation from mining companies to Mauritania
and no EU fishing compensation have decreased gross reserves to US$639 million in December
2014 from US$996 million at end-2013, to close to five months of prospective imports excluding
those related to extractive industries.
6.
Fiscal policy has aimed at maintaining consolidation efforts. In 2013, the overall balance,
excluding grants, posted a deficit of 2.2 percent of non-extractive GDP, down from 3 percent in
2012.3 Budget execution up to the third quarter of 2014 showed an overall deficit (excluding grants)
of 3 percent because of high capital spending execution compared to the annual envelope. Within
tax revenues, lower domestic VAT revenues were more than offset by higher corporate income
taxes, customs revenues, and taxes on wages and salaries. For nontax revenues, higher revenues
from fishing licenses partially mitigated the slight decline in dividends and royalties from public
enterprises. Despite progress in revenue mobilization (Box 1), fiscal consolidation did not result in
improved non-extractive fiscal balances and external debt maintained an upward trend and—
despite the upward revision in national income accounts—remains elevated at 73½ percent of GDP
at end-2014.4
7.
The risk of debt distress is assessed to be high because of the lagged effects of the
deterioration of the institutional environment in 2009 on debt thresholds (Annex I). The debt
sustainability analysis reports the breach of one of the debt thresholds in the baseline scenario,
leading to a deterioration of the assessed risk of debt distress. This is associated with lower debt
thresholds, driven by the lagged effects of the worsened institutional capacity as measured by the
World Bank’s CPIA rating in 2009, even though this rating has improved continuously since 2010.

The public debt-to-GDP ratio has declined from the previously reported level (98 percent of GDP in June 2013) due
to higher GDP figures in the new national accounts.

The projected increase in new debt disbursements for infrastructure projects has also contributed to
this reclassification.
Box 1. Tax Revenue Performance in Mauritania1/
Mauritania has experienced a rapid and significant increase in tax revenue collection over the past
years. The tax effort is especially worth noting, given the crisis in neighboring Mali and elections in the past
year. The ratio of tax revenues (excluding those from natural resources) to GDP improved by more than
50 percent since 2010, reaching an estimated 22 percent of GDP in 2013. Corporate Income Tax (CIT)
doubled, to 4.0 percent. Payroll tax and VAT increased by about 60 percent, to 3 percent and 8 percent
respectively. This increase does not consider revenues associated with extractive industries. The amount of
tax revenues generated by mining activities reached 5.0 percent of GDP in 2013.
Mauritania seems to have so far avoided the resource curse regarding taxation; domestic revenue
mobilization improved during the recent boom in commodity prices. This can be attributed to the low
share of foreign exchange earnings that re-enter the country.
Non-extractive tax revenues performed strongly as the VAT regime in the mining supported
formalizing the economy. For any developing country, the VAT self-enforcing property dominates its
neutrality: (1) the cascading effect of a general sales tax—the alternative to a neutral VAT—is limited by the
low number of production stages in Mauritania; (2) economic agents in the formal sector—especially
exporters—who can claim VAT credit have an incentive to acquire their purchases from formal suppliers that
provide proper VAT invoices. Mining firms, taxed at a zero rate because they are exporters, can be
reimbursed if and only if they can prove that their domestic purchases are taxed under local VAT. These
transactions provide useful information that can be used to broaden the tax base. However, Mauritania could
benefit further on this front, as local purchases in Mauritania remain comparatively low: the World Gold
Council estimated that local purchases represented 38½ percent of total expenditure in 2012—compared
with 89 percent for Mali, 91 percent for Ghana, and 67 percent for Burkina Faso.
In addition, the Mauritanian government engaged in several important and complementary reforms
in revenue administration and tax policy.

By eliminating the global income tax in 2012, Mauritania switched to a dual tax system, where
progressivity of the tax system is kept only on wages.

Mauritania implemented reforms to protect its tax base against aggressive tax optimization by
multinational companies. In 2013, a withholding tax of 15 percent on any payment to nonresidents limits
profit-shifting to foreign countries. The authorities are working on a thin-cap rule and taxation on capital
gains from indirect transfer of mining titles.
Mauritania-specific factors can also explain the increase in revenue collection. For example, the rise of
CIT can be explained by the end of the CIT exemption in 2012 and by the end of the minimum tax revenue
(2.5 percent on turnover) collected by customs. CIT revenues rose by 1.3 percent of GDP to 3.7 percent in
2012, while minimum tax revenue increased from 0.8 percent to 1.4 percent of GDP. The latter tax is similar
to a royalty at 2.5 percent; however, it is creditable against the CIT and collected by customs. This point is
important because it reinforces the coordination between the ministries of finance and mining, and improves
the quality of valuation of exported minerals.

8.
Monetary indicators suggest a moderate increase in credit and excess liquidity (FSSA
report). Between October 2013 and 2014, as short-term deposits fueled broad money growth from
9.8 percent to 11.4 percent, banks’ credit growth slowed from 13.3 percent to 12.1 percent. Despite
the CBM’s increased FX sales, which helped stabilize excess liquidity in the past, liquidity in the
banking system has started to increase since mid-2014, on account of limited investment
opportunities. Free reserves increased in October 2014 on an annual basis.5
9.
The banking sector is well capitalized and liquid, but remains fragile to shocks. High
credit concentration (including credit to the public sector), foreign-exchange risk exposures, and low
profitability due to a constrained business model and higher competition exacerbate banking
vulnerabilities. Although the banking system appears well-capitalized overall, some banks are not
meeting the minimum capital requirement and are under-provisioned. Asset quality remains weak:
nonperforming loans (NPLs) represented 20 percent of loans in the second quarter of 2014. On
December 31, 2014 the CBM removed the licenses of Maurisbank, an undercapitalized bank, and of
FCI, a financial institution with negative capital and little credit activity. The cases are likely to be
contested in courts and deposits be covered by the existing deposit insurance.
10.
Advances in social indicators remain stalled. Poverty and unemployment remain elevated
and progress toward achieving the MDGs is uneven. About 26 percent of households were
estimated to be food-insecure in June 2014, in part because of higher rural migration to
Nouakchott. Progress toward building the foundation for inclusive growth, as set at the time of 2012
Article IV, has been mixed (Appendix I).

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
11.
The near-term outlook remains favorable despite slower economic activity and lower
iron ore prices.


Slower economic activity in 2015. After recovering to 6.4 percent in 2014 (to the effect of the
strong rebound in fishing, which drives non-extractive GDP growth to 7.1 percent), real GDP
growth is projected at 5.5 percent in 2015 because of lower growth in mining activity, and lower
public investment and consumption from the demand side. Terms of trade are projected to
deteriorate by 4.5 percent as lower iron ore prices (24 percent) are partially compensated by the
decline in oil prices (40 percent). The current account deficit in 2015 (at 7.7 percent of GDP)
narrows significantly due to higher transfers associated with the telecom licensing. The overall
fiscal deficit is projected at 4.7 percent of non-extractive GDP (compared to 3 percent of non-

extractive GDP under the revised 2014 budget law) on account of lower-than-expected SNIM’s
contribution and VAT receipts and similar capital execution with respect to the original budget.6


Inflation is expected to accelerate somewhat but remain below 5 percent, favored by the
decline in international food prices and lower non-extractive GDP growth. Continued
appreciation in real terms could result in higher private sector demand given the high share of
imported goods and services in the consumption basket.

12.
Downside risks to the outlook are dominated by global developments (see Risk
Assessment Matrix). The authorities acknowledged the downside risks to the external outlook.


Spillovers from weakening external demand for commodities could further reduce iron ore
prices and mining export revenues (Box 2). Advanced economies will eventually exit from the
supportive monetary policies implemented in recent years—which could lead to lower demand.
China’s economy is expected to rebalance away from an investment-based growth model
toward a more consumption-based model. Both these factors will likely have significant
spillovers globally and affect commodity markets. Larger-than-envisaged declines in main export
prices would further reduce exports and FDI, and cast doubts on mining expansion plans,
dimming growth prospects and worsening fiscal balances. External shocks could expose
vulnerabilities in the banking system, exacerbating a negative shock to growth and financial
stability.



Spillovers from global oil and food prices—other important channels for inward transmission—
could work favorably for Mauritania as a net importer in the context of subdued global growth.
However, a worsening of geopolitical risks in Ukraine/Russia or the Middle East that could
reverse oil price dynamics would negatively affect trade flows.



At the domestic level, the Mauritanian economy remains exposed to drought, which could
require additional budget support to assist the affected population. At the regional level,
although Mauritania is not affected by the Ebola outbreak, the effects of health risks in West
Africa could dampen Mauritania’s economy through its trade ties with neighboring countries.

6

Dividends from SNIM—the state-owned mining company—are estimated to account for 2.1 percent of nonextractive GDP, against the originally budgeted 3.8 percent of non-extractive GDP.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF MAURITANIA

Box 2. External Spillovers to Mauritania’s Economy
This box explores a scenario in which iron ore prices decline further than envisaged, the planned mining
expansion comes to a halt, and SNIM’s dividend contribution to the budget stops. The medium-run implications
of such a scenario would require adequate policy response from the authorities, including a depreciation of the
ouguiya to reflect weaker fundamentals and the use of buffers.
Global spillovers from iron ore markets. Iron ore represents about half of Mauritania’s exports. Global iron
ore demand has been highly dependent on China, which imports about two-thirds of the global volume.
With record high prices in recent years, iron ore supply surged, in anticipation of China’s increasing steel
production. However, analysts have now identified signs of oversupply and predict that the largest world
suppliers, Australia and Brazil, are taking the opportunity to reduce competition. Iron ore futures, at about
US$64–66 in 2015–16, suggest a further 20 percent decline in prices below the projections embedded in the
baseline. If these prices materialize, they would pose risks to Mauritania’s budgetary revenues because of
SNIM’s lower dividend contribution, balance of payment dynamics through lower FX receipts, and,
ultimately, lower potential economic growth if the planned mining capacity expansion does not take place;
project feasibility depends on how far prices are from projects’ reservation prices.
Downside scenario. Under an alternative (somewhat extreme) scenario with no mining expansion beyond
the almost-complete Gelb II project and no SNIM dividend contribution to the budget during 2015–20,
economic growth would be lower by more than 3 percentage points for 2018–19 relative to the baseline and
the fiscal position would substantially deteriorate over the medium term—with an additional fiscal deficit,
ranging from 1.6 percent to 2.5 percent of non-extractive GDP. Although private transfers and other capital
inflows in 2015–17 will support reserve levels, starting in 2018 the cancellation of additional mines will lower
mining exports and widen the external financing gap for 2018–20.
To dampen first-round effects, the authorities will need to respond using all policy tools at their disposal.
Weaker fundamentals will result in a more depreciated ouguiya. The government would likely have to
prioritize its public investment plan to achieve maximum possible fiscal savings without sacrificing the most
pressing investment projects. At the same time, the country would have to accelerate its plans to diversify
the economy away from mining so as to maintain potential without the mining expansion. The government
would seek the appropriate policy mix to mitigate the revenue shortfall by adjusting spending, raising
revenues, and seeking additional budget support from donors.

Medium-term prospects remain promising. With iron ore prices stabilizing at US$72 per
ton under the baseline, Mauritania’s large resource endowment provides ample opportunities for
development. Iron production is projected to more than double over the medium term, with real
GDP growth averaging 6.5 percent per year during 2015–20. SNIM, the public mining company, is
projected to ramp up production to MT22.75 per year by 2020 and by MT49.5 by 2030. The start of
the Tazadit underground mine in 2015 (peak production is expected after 2017 with MT2.5 per year)
and the Askaf mine in 2017 (with peak production of MT22.5 per year by 2023) are projected to
keep the growth of extractive GDP at 11 percent per year, on average, during 2015–20. Moving
forward with the Banda Gas project (with the potential of up to BTU65 billion per day over 20 years)
will provide Mauritania and the sub-region affordable and cleaner power, resulting in an additional
upside for growth in Mauritania.
14.
The authorities expressed confidence in the continued strong growth and a
strengthening of the BOP over the medium term, while acknowledging the downside risks to
the external outlook.


The authorities pointed to their recent achievements despite the external shocks, including
continued elevated economic growth and contained inflation in 2014. They emphasized that
risks to macroeconomic stability could materialize in the context of a double shock (with
declining mining prices and rising oil prices, as in 2008), and noted upside risks to the outlook,
given that their development strategy was focused on scaled-up public investment that was to
be sustained by rising export earnings and fiscal revenues over the medium term.



The authorities emphasized steps to address the 2014–16 terms of trade deterioration. The
budget in 2015 aims at absorbing this external shock (¶16), and further adjustment or use of
buffers is envisaged if additional revenue shortfalls materialize. The CBM discussed the scope to
further accumulate reserves in the context of reduced FX demand for imports and additional
receipts from telecomm licensing, while envisaging higher exchange rate flexibility (¶21). Scaledup investment and progress in the business environment would support private sector
development and economic diversification, especially in agriculture, fishing, and services (¶26).
On that basis, the authorities did not consider additional adjustments necessary at this time.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
The outlook depends on consolidating macroeconomic stability by strengthening governance and
addressing vulnerabilities. In addition, strengthening of the financial sector, greater financial inclusion,
and implementation of broad structural reforms to support private sector development and economic
diversification will make it possible to support growth, create jobs and promote its inclusiveness.

A. Consolidating Macroeconomic Stability by Strengthening Policy
Formulation and Public Sector Governance
Strengthening fiscal policy formulation to support medium-term sustainability
15.
The 2015 budget focuses on mitigating the mining revenue shortfall. The budget
envisages keeping the fiscal position to an overall deficit (excluding grants) of 2.1 percent of nonextractive GDP. Extractive revenue losses, estimated at 3.2 percent of non-extractive GDP, would be
mostly offset by an increase in VAT revenues (0.6 percent of non-extractive GDP) resulting from a
hike of 2 percentage points in the VAT rate to 16 percent and from lower current spending (of
1.8 percent of non-extractive

agreed with the authorities on
making use of fiscal buffers to smooth the shock in the short term. The authorities highlighted the
relatively small magnitude of the wage increase.
16.
The budget may come under stress. The expected dividend contribution from SNIM, at
UM36 billion, seems optimistic, given the 27 percent decline in iron ore average prices during 2014.7
SNIM has also undertaken ambitious investments that may hinder its ability to distribute dividends.
In addition, the envisaged contribution from the higher VAT tax rate could underperform in light of
slower economic activity. Because of the unclear effect of fiscal consolidation on economic activity,
staff recommended using fiscal buffers to address additional revenue shortfalls. The authorities
should rebalance their spending, continue to rely on financing on concessional terms, and refrain

from non-concessional external borrowing—even in the form of pledging future resource revenues.8
The authorities, however, were confident about budget risks remaining manageable given the
additional oil revenue windfall, which should be registered in the fiscal accounts; and the renewal of
telecom licenses at end-2015, which could provide room for reducing debt and smoothing
adjustment in case of larger-than-envisaged shocks.9
17.
Staff made the following recommendations on measures to buttress medium-term
fiscal sustainability and reduce the risk of debt distress. The authorities recognize the need to
maintain efforts on these fronts.


Renew revenue mobilization efforts through improved tax collection capacity and a widening of
the tax base. To increase non-resource revenue, reforms need to be accelerated to limit tax
expenditures (under evaluation) and strengthen human resources of the tax and customs
administrations, improve information technology systems, and widen the list of taxpayers.



Curb current expenditure by proactively managing the wage bill, and by gradually phasing out
subsidies and transfers to other public sector entities. As a first step, the budget should fully
recognize the transfers to SOMELEC, the public electricity company, and establish a clear
mechanism that determines budget support,10 and register the revenue windfall from declining
oil prices to improve budget transparency. More importantly, the authorities should apply the
automatic pricing rule formula. Efforts to reduce the size of the civil service and introduce a
performance-based compensation system would reduce the wage bill and increase productivity.
A timeline for eliminating subsidies (on electricity and food products) should be accompanied
by appropriate communication and the broad establishment of the targeted cash transfer
program to limit the impact on the neediest.



Enhance monitoring of public enterprises to foster greater efficiency, including analyzing
potential fiscal risks. The authorities need to make progress in resolving pending arrears with
SOMELEC. The macro relevance of SNIM requires stronger accountability and transparency. A
broader coverage of public finances, beyond the central government, will facilitate a better
understanding and management of the fiscal stance.

8

Collateralized borrowing, by pledging future mineral revenues, is made on nonconcessional terms, and reduces
budget flexibility (by earmarking revenues for debt service) and a country’s flexibility in mobilizing and managing
foreign exchange, increasing its potential vulnerability to shocks. It could also worsen the status of current and future
creditors by protecting some; can raise creditworthiness risks; and usually ends up being more costly than more
traditional borrowing schemes. Careful consideration of their full implications needs to be taking into account before
engaging in such schemes.
9

The authorities introduced a new petroleum price structure and adjustment formula, bringing domestic prices to
international levels in 2012 (IMF Country Report No. 12/323); however, domestic prices have remained relatively
stable despite the recent decline in oil prices, which has translated into a revenue windfall for the authorities. These
additional revenues have not yet been registered in the TOFE, the budget reporting system, nor in the 2015 budget.
10

The MoF is in discussions with SOMELEC to determine the budget transfer required to support the operations of
SOMELEC.

14

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF MAURITANIA



Enhance the efficiency of capital spending by ensuring consistency with PRSP priorities and
absorption capacity, while ensuring debt sustainability. Identifying the magnitude of the
infrastructure gap and establishing a multiyear program of investment could increase
investment efficiency.



Reduce risks of debt distress by resolving Kuwait’s passive debt; contracting external loans on
concessional terms; enhancing the oversight and capacity of the public debt management office
at the Ministry of Finance; and improving institutional capacity and coordination to enhance
debt management practices.

18.
Addressing fiscal dependence on extractive resources is necessary to improve fiscal
policy formulation. The budgetary framework should include a fiscal rule, a fiscal anchor, and a
fiscal stabilization fund that take price volatility into account, while incorporating intergenerational
equity considerations through a resource wealth fund. This budgetary framework should be
supported by robust institutions to enhance the management of mining wealth. Strengthening fiscal
policy formulation will help better safeguard the budget against boom-and-bust cycles in
nonrenewable resources (Box 3), reduce procyclicality, and provide predictability to fiscal policy. The
authorities agreed in principle with this approach but felt that such reforms are premature. Staff
supported the authorities’ intention to continue pursuing reforms in public financial management,
including a multiyear fiscal framework and the approval of the organic finance law (planned for
2015), which are considered prerequisites for introducing the fiscal rule.

Box 3. Strengthening the Macro-Fiscal Framework in Mauritania1/
Mauritania’s economy is dependent on natural resources,
with minerals accounting for over 75 percent of total
exports and 30 percent of the central government’s
revenues. Given the significance of mineral revenues, fiscal
policy needs to address not only issues of demand
management and long-term sustainability as in other
countries, but also challenges arising from the volatility of
commodity prices and their effect on government finances,
and from the exhaustibility of the mining reserves in the
ground to address intergenerational equity considerations.

Resource-rich developing countries (RRDCs) are more
inclined to run procyclical fiscal policies, which often results in fiscal expenditure volatility. The
current deterioration in iron ore prices and, on the other hand, the potential expansion of production both
rise important fiscal policy challenges for Mauritania. Avoiding procyclical fiscal policies and adopting rules
that guide medium-term budget formulation will help increase the resilience of the economy to external
shocks, reduce fiscal stance and growth volatility, and enhance policy predictability.
RRDCs face the double challenge of transforming their resource wealth into assets that support
sustained development, while also maintaining mechanisms to avoid the boom-bust cycles that stem
from volatility in natural resource revenues.

Depleting resource wealth will be converted into a portfolio of other assets to support sustained
development, including human capital, domestic public and private capital, and foreign financial assets.
Capital scarcity (including infrastructure gaps and constrained capital market access) suggests that the
returns on domestic investment are likely to be higher than returns to international financial assets.
Therefore, part of the resource wealth should be invested in building domestic capital, subject to absorptive
capacity constraints, while low incomes may justify some tilting of consumption toward poorer current
generations.

RRDCs also need to avoid boom-bust cycles by working to delink spending from the volatility
dynamics of resource revenues, which result from resource exhaustibility and price volatility. Resource
exhaustibility gives rise to intertemporal decisions about how much of the resource wealth to consume and
how much to save, with implications for intergenerational equity and long-term fiscal and external
sustainability (that is, avoiding the need for massive fiscal adjustment once resource wealth is depleted).
Revenue volatility calls for distinct medium-term fiscal rules and precautionary savings to limit procyclicality
(by delinking expenditures from resource revenues).
The fiscal framework requires appropriate fiscal institutions to support the transparent and efficient
management of resource wealth. The adoption of a fiscal rule must be mirrored by a stabilization/savings
fund with clear objectives and a strong governance structure. The fiscal framework for RRDCs sets out
additional indicators on resource use, and fiscal rules for managing price volatility and establishing fiscal
sustainability benchmarks. Additionally, resource-rich countries with stronger institutions tend to have better
macroeconomic and growth performance. Challenges to setting up sound institutions include pressures to
redistribute of a windfall when institutions are weak; pressures to earmark investments to geographic areas
from which resources are extracted; and investments that are not integrated into the budget or not fully
transparent. Appropriate fiscal institutions include those that affect the capacity to undertake long-term
revenue forecasts, establish medium-term budget objectives, implement high-quality investment projects,
and manage special institutions such as natural resource funds. Institutionalized savings rules could support
incentives for saving revenues.

Coordinating monetary and exchange rate policies to support contained inflation and
enhance exchange rate flexibility
19.
Monetary conditions are favorable to strengthening the monetary policy framework.
Staff agreed with the authorities on the need to evaluate liquidity conditions, adopt a formal
liquidity forecasting framework and enlarge liquidity management tools. In the context of contained
inflation, the CBM has relied on indirect monetary policy instruments (FX interventions and T-bills)
to reduce liquidity, leaving its policy rate and reserve requirements unchanged since 2009.11
However, FX interventions will be constrained by lower reserves as an instrument for managing
liquidity. Staff called for a start to formalizing monetary policy and the liquidity management
framework in the context of weak inflationary pressures with a view to strengthening governance
and institutions for the conduct of monetary policy; and agreed with the authorities on expanding
the instruments to include standing facilities and deposit certificates. The authorities noted that
implementing the strategy to develop these instruments needs to go in parallel with the
recapitalization of the CBM to ensure its operational autonomy and facilitate bearing the costs of
monetary policy. Although inflation has remained contained in recent years, a volatile global outlook
and pressures on FX reserves could result in rapid changes in price expectations. Staff agreed with a
proactive use of reserve requirements if demand pressures materialize ahead of reforms, given the
limited effectiveness of the interest rate transmission mechanism.
20.
Gradually reforming the foreign exchange market will be essential to increase the role
of the exchange rate as a shock absorber and to support economic development. The
exchange rate regime has been reclassified as “stabilized,” from “other managed” (see Informational
Annex), and staff assessed the ouguiya as broadly consistent with medium-term fundamentals
(Appendix II). However, the current exchange rate policy of gradual depreciation vis-à-vis the U.S.
dollar may result in misalignment from a short-term perspective in the event of further
strengthening of the U.S. dollar vis-à-vis other

increasing predictability in FX intervention (by, among other measures, regulating private sector
access to direct sales under exceptional circumstances) and shifting toward a wholesale auction may
deepen the market and support exchange rate flexibility. Over the long term, deeper coordination
between exchange rate and monetary policies, combined with changes in regulatory and
institutional arrangements, will support gradual development of the interbank FX market.
21.
The authorities are committed to meeting Mauritania’s obligations under Article VIII
of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement. A recent comprehensive review of Mauritania’s foreign
exchange system identified three multiple currency practices (MCPs) and two exchange
restrictions.12 The authorities have already eliminated the three MCPs and the exchange restriction
arising from the limitation on the availability of foreign exchange for multiple transactions below
US$50,000, while ensuring a minimal impact on the functioning of the market; therefore the only
remaining exchange restriction arises from the insufficient foreign exchange availability at the fixing
sessions (auctions) organized by the CBM for those transactions that are required to be submitted
to the fixing sessions. The authorities noted that these exchange measures existed since the FX
market was first set up in 2007 with Fund technical assistance. The authorities request the Fund’s
approval to temporarily maintain the remaining exchange restriction as it is necessary for BOP
reasons and does not discriminate among Fund members. The authorities commit to eliminate the
restriction, working with staff, within one year following the approval.

B. Strengthening Financial Stability and Promoting Financial Inclusion
22.
The strengthening of the financial regulatory framework needs to be accompanied by
its enforcement, to support financial stability. The CBM has adopted regulation on risk
classification, provisioning, and bank governance, and is developing risk-based supervision
procedures and on-site inspection methodology. Supervisory capacity has also been strengthened
with new personnel for inspections and IT systems to support real-time data transmission. However,
enforcement is weak because of the lack of legal protection for the supervisory authorities. In
addition, strengthened procedures for licensing and consolidated supervision, for risk concentration
and capital requirements, higher reporting standards and transparency on the financial situation of
credit institutions as well as expanding CBM supervision to the Deposit and Development Fund
(CDD) and the insurance sector will help support financial stability. Staff welcomed the authorities’
interest in anchoring the medium-term financial reform agenda in the accompanying FSAP
(Appendix III).
12

The MCPs arise from (i) the mandatory commissions and penalties on transactions at the fixing session (auctions);
(ii) the mandatory use of the official rate for direct FX transactions with the CBM and the lack of a mechanism to
prevent the deviation by more than 2 percent of the official rate from the fixing rate used in the fixing session and
from the exchange rate used in other transactions in the market; and (iii) the segmentation of the market in the
absence of a mechanism to ensure that the exchange rates in the fixing sessions and bank-to-client bilateral
transactions do not deviate from each other by more than 2 percent. The exchange restrictions arise from (i) the
insufficient foreign exchange availability at the fixing sessions organized by the CBM for those transactions that are
required to be submitted to the fixing sessions, and (ii) the limitation on the availability of foreign exchange for
multiple transactions below US$50,000.

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF MAURITANIA

23.
The CBM’s role in times of stress needs to be strengthened. The CBM agreed with staff’s
recommendations on the need to revise the existing banking resolution framework for addressing
troubled financial institutions. Following the FSSA recommendations, the authorities agreed to
expedite a revised banking law that provides independence and legal protection to the authorities in
exercising their competencies, while introducing early-warning solvency and liquidity indicators. The
authorities also agreed on the need to reinforce the deposit guarantee fund, which remains
insufficient.
24.
Promoting financial inclusion requires reducing economic informality. The financial
system remains small, underdeveloped, and constrained by dependence on short-term funding. The
small number of depositors reflects the still-large informal economy. According to the World Bank,
only 17 percent of the population has accounts in a formal financial institution, lower than the
Middle East and North Africa regional average (36 percent). As a result of the short maturity of
funding sources, credit to the private sector is essentially short-term. Loans to small and mediumsized enterprises (SMEs) are constrained by collateral requirements. In addition, the banks’ ability to
play a decisive role in supporting private sector development is limited by nonperforming loans. At
the same time, financial services are difficult to access because of physical and geographic isolation,
insufficient infrastructure, and a lack of financial

Authorities’ efforts to set standards for corporations’ financial statements and regular updates in the
credit registry are also welcome.

C. Structural Reforms to Facilitate More Inclusive Growth
25.
With macroeconomic stability regained, policies need to focus on promoting inclusive
growth. The economy is characterized by low productivity, and most of the Millennium
Development Goals in education, health, and environmental sustainability appear out of reach by
2015. Mauritania’s private sector is narrow and its development is hindered by longstanding

structural bottlenecks, a weak business environment,
and poor governance. The government has scaled up
public investment to address large infrastructure gaps.
Continued efforts are crucial to tackle a challenging
reform agenda: strengthening institutions, the
business climate, human capital, and labor markets
and promoting the private sector

as the engine of growth, economic diversification, and job creation while supporting better social
protection and economic inclusion of vulnerable and marginalized people.
26.
The authorities envisage structural reforms to manage external risks more effectively
and promote job creation. The authorities recognized the need to focus on promoting private
sector development and economic diversification while protecting the most vulnerable. This strategy
will strengthen the economy’s resilience to external shocks and offer macroeconomic benefits
associated with job creation and inclusiveness.


The authorities have identified comparative sectoral advantages (in agriculture, livestock, and
fishing) and have started implementing plans to increase value added in production and to
diversify an export base narrowly concentrated in unprocessed fishing and mining.



The private sector development strategy is supported by an action plan to improve the business
environment. Mauritania ranks low on the World Bank’s 2014 Doing Business indicators (173 out
of 189). The business climate is encumbered by burdensome procedures related to insolvency,
payment of taxes, starting a business, and obtaining credit. The authorities have taken steps to
improve the business climate by eliminating minimum capital requirements and by introducing a
one-stop shop to facilitate SME creation. In addition, staff encouraged the authorities to
increase transparency in procurement, develop the public-private partnership framework, and
strengthen dialogue with private sector stakeholders.



The authorities recognized the need for higher human capital and better jobs. Reforms are
needed to improve education and the functioning of the labor market so as to generate more
jobs in the formal sector. Assuming a constant rate of participation, the economy will need to
create some 200,000 jobs during 2014–20 to absorb new entrants in the labor market. The
unemployment rate reported and the informal sector mask significant heterogeneity across age,
gender, and region.

27.
The authorities have made progress in targeting social transfers. With the support of the
World Bank, the authorities launched a household survey to identify poverty profiles. The survey will
result in a registry of beneficiaries that will facilitate better targeting of transfers to the most
vulnerable. Progress has been limited, however, and the timeline for implementing countrywide
targeted social transfers is unclear, with important implications for subsidy reform. A parallel
strategy to enhance access to, and quality of, public services will also be important for the future
development of conditional cash transfers to improve food security, education, and health
outcomes.
28.
Strengthening governance and institutions will support a more inclusive economic
process. A level playing field that allows private companies to participate and compete will increase
the contribution of the private sector as a growth engine. This will also require large state-owned
companies such as SNIM—which has become active in non-mining activities—to refocus on their
mandate to improve their efficiency. In addition, enhancing the governance of public institutions,
which should include communicating decisions undertaken in the conduct of macro policies, would

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF MAURITANIA

enhance policy predictability. Better access to public sector information would also provide a better
understanding, in general, of the public sector’s economic role.
29.
Efforts to strengthen macroeconomics statistics should continue. Data provision is
broadly adequate for surveillance purposes, but data gaps, related mostly to capacity constraints,
still affect many areas, including balance of payments, fiscal, debt and labor markets indicators
(Appendix IV). Good progress is being made in upgrading national accounts statistics, and new
surveys have allowed for updated employment data and social indicators. A replacement for the
outdated CPI index is expected to be available in 2015, and will offer broader geographical
coverage. Incorporating GFM2001 in fiscal statistics and expanding data coverage beyond the
central government will facilitate a comprehensive assessment of the fiscal policy stance. Additional
Fund and World Bank technical assistance is planned to help strengthen data quality.

STAFF APPRAISAL
30.
Mauritania continues to be one of the fastest-growing economies in the Middle East
and North Africa region. Growth in 2012–14 remains elevated supported by infrastructure
investment, increasing mining production, and strong services activity. Inflation fell to a three-year
low in August but has picked up recently on higher gas prices and domestic food prices.
31.
The near-term outlook remains favorable, but vulnerable to external shocks. Largerthan-envisaged deterioration in terms of trade—beyond the declines in iron ore prices realized in
2014 and projected for 2015–16—would require a rapid policy response, including higher exchange
rate flexibility and fiscal measures to absorb the shock, as well as further policy adjustments down
the road. Maintaining FX intervention, despite lower FX receipts, resulted in a significant decline in
reserves, a trend that may not be sustainable. In particular, the outlook is subject to downside risks
from the uncertain prospects for global demand for commodities, which could negatively impact
Mauritania via trade and FDI channels. Vulnerabilities in the banking system could be exposed, and
these could exacerbate a negative shock to growth.
32.
The 2015 draft budget focuses on adjusting to lower mining revenues, but additional
measures may be needed. Extractive revenue losses would be offset by an increase in the VAT rate
and lower current spending; however, the authorities should prepare to take additional measures if
the budget comes under stress. In particular, the authorities should record the oil windfall revenues
in the fiscal accounts, rebalance their spending, use buffers, rely on financing in concessional terms
and refrain from pledging mineral resources to collateralize nonconcessional borrowing—especially
in the context of Mauritania’s elevated debt level. Measures should concentrate on renewing
revenue mobilization efforts; curbing current expenditure; enhancing monitoring of public
enterprises; making capital spending more efficient; and managing external debt so as to reduce the
risks of debt distress. The authorities should apply the automatic pricing rule formula to enhance its
credibility.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF MAURITANIA

33.
Reforming the fiscal framework to address fiscal dependence on extractive resources
will strengthen fiscal policy formulation. The budgetary framework should include a fiscal rule, a
fiscal anchor, and a fiscal stabilization fund that take price volatility into account to help safeguard
the budget against boom-and-bust cycles, while incorporating intergenerational equity
considerations through a natural resource fund. Robust institutions are also needed to manage
prospective increasing mining wealth. Continuing with reforms in public financial management,
including a multi-year fiscal framework and the approval of the organic finance law, are crucial for
introducing the fiscal rule.
34.
Strengthening the monetary policy framework will facilitate proactive use of monetary
policy. The authorities should take advantage of the present contained inflation to adopt a formal
liquidity forecasting framework and enlarge the set of liquidity management tools. This will help to
formalize monetary policy; improve the transmission mechanism to the real economy, and
strengthen institutions and governance for the conduct of monetary policy. By managing liquidity
more effectively, the CBM would be in a better position to reduce FX intervention. The
recapitalization of the CBM should be undertaken to support its conduct of monetary policy.
35.
Gradually increasing exchange rate flexibility will help absorb external shocks and
support economic development over the long term. The exchange rate regime has been
reclassified as “stabilized” from “other managed”. While the ouguiya is in line with fundamentals
from a medium-term perspective, the current exchange rate policy of gradual depreciation vis-à-vis
the U.S. dollar may result in misalignment from a short-term perspective in the event of further
strengthening of the U.S. dollar vis-à-vis other major currencies given the extended negative terms
of trade. Mauritania needs to rebuild external buffers to support external stability, and plans to
gradually liberalize the foreign exchange market. Reducing market imperfections, increasing
predictability in FX intervention and shifting toward a wholesale auction would deepen the market
and support higher exchange rate flexibility. Over the long term, the central bank needs to transition
toward the objective of intervening only to smooth excessive exchange rate volatility. Coordination
between exchange rate and monetary policies, combined with changes in the regulatory and
institutional arrangements, will support gradual development of the interbank FX market.
36.
Efforts to strengthen financial stability should continue. Building on progress in
strengthening banks’ capitalization and liquidity, the CBM should strictly enforce the existing
regulatory framework, which will require revising the banking law to provide legal protection of staff
in the exercise of their competencies. In addition, strengthening procedures for licensing and
consolidated supervision and for risk concentration and capital requirements, higher reporting
standards, and transparency on the financial situation of credit institutions, as well as expanding
CBM supervision to the public bank and the insurance sector, will help support financial stability. The
bank resolution regime should be enhanced, and a legal framework developed for introducing
early-warning solvency and liquidity indicators. The deposit guarantee fund needs additional
funding. Staff welcomed the authorities’ objective in anchoring the medium-term financial reform
agenda in the accompanying FSSA recommendations.

provide ample opportunities for development. Mining GDP is projected to expand rapidly during the
next five years as large projects come on stream. Sustained growth outside the mining sector would
need to be supported by continued structural reforms to promote private sector development and
economic diversification through improvements in the business environment and higher human
capital, while protecting the most vulnerable. Promoting access to credit and financial inclusion are
also required for private sector development. Efforts to strengthen macroeconomic statistics should
continue.
38.
Staff supports the authorities’ request for approval of the remaining exchange
restriction. Staff welcomes the determination of the authorities to bring Mauritanian foreign
exchange regime in compliance with the member’s Article VIII obligations, and the timely
elimination of most of the identified exchange measures. Staff considers that the temporary
retention of the remaining exchange restriction is necessary for balance of payments reasons. In
addition, the exchange restriction does not discriminate among Fund members. In view of the
authorities’ commitment to eliminate this restriction in the next calendar year, and progress already
achieved regarding other identified measures, staff recommends the temporary approval of the
retention of this restriction until January 28, 2016 or the date of the conclusion of the next Article IV
consultation, whichever is earlier.
39.

It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

Appendix I. Mauritania: Implementation Status of the Main 2012
Article IV Recommendations
Mauritania’s 2012 Article IV policy recommendations were focused on maintaining short-term macroeconomic stability
in the face of the 2011 drought and building the foundation for inclusive growth over the medium term. Progress in
implementing the recommendations has been mixed.
Recommendations
Fiscal Policy
Framework for managing the
mining wealth

Implementation status
Partial progress
Partial progress. Revenues from high iron ore prices allowed for higher
social and capital spending. However, more progress is needed to anchor
fiscal policy to non-mining revenues and to adopt a fiscal framework for
managing mining wealth, including a stabilization fund.

Subsidy reform and wage bill
containment

Partial progress. The subsidy for diesel products was removed, but the rulebased mechanism has not been applied. The tariff study on electricity was
completed, but progress is lacking on removing the electricity subsidy. A
study was launched to clarify SOMELEC’s optimal budget transfer. The
authorities are advancing with SOMAGAZ privatization and the gas subsidy.
The design of an automatic pricing formula along with a timetable for rate
increases has not been completed. The wage bill has continued to rise.

Public sector governance:
improving public financial
management (PFM) and limiting
fiscal risks of large infrastructure
projects

Partial progress. With technical assistance, the authorities are implementing
the single account. However, the repayment plan for domestic arrears
stopped in 2013. SNIM facilitated financing for the new airport project by
acquiring land in an operation that exposed financing constraints.

Mining taxation

Progress. Some aspects of the new mining code are in line with best
international practices; but issues on IT exemptions, asymmetric and
stability clauses, and reduced rate on payroll taxes need further
improvements.

Debt sustainability

No progress. Although most debt is contracted on concessional terms,
some nonconcessional debt has been contracted. Debt level of 54.5
percent by 2017 is out of reach by a wide margin.
Partial Progress. The central bank has taken significant steps to strengthen
banking supervision and the regulatory framework to limit banking risk
profile; and efforts are needed on enforcement. On the monetary policy
framework, the liquidity management framework and the monetary
transmission mechanism are weak, hindering effective monetary policy.
Financial intermediation has improved but remains low.
Partial progress. The authorities have progressed on implementing new
investment and procurement codes, establishing a one-stop shop, and
streamlining taxpayers’ procedures. Reforms to the agricultural sector
support developing its potential as an employment generator.

Monetary and Financial Policies; to
enhance banking system stability,
the effectiveness of monetary
policy and financial intermediation

Structural reforms, enhancing the
investment climate and labor
market policies to create more
employment opportunities.

Appendix II. Mauritania: External Sector Assessment
1.
Mauritania’s real effective exchange rate (REER) has appreciated by over 6 percent
over the past two years. The nominal effective
exchange rate (NEER) appreciated by a similar
110
Effective Exchange Rates
magnitude over the same period, largely owing to the
(Index Jan 2010 = 100)
recent depreciation of the euro, a major trading
105
REER
partners’ currency, against the dollar, relative to which
NEER
the ouguiya remained stable. With inflation rates in
100
trading partner countries at historical lows, even the
relatively modest price increases in Mauritania over the
95
past few years resulted in a more substantial
appreciation of the real exchange rate of 12 percent
90
since the end of 2012.
85

2.
Mauritania’s foreign reserves increased
2010 2011 2012 2013 2014
rapidly in 2012 but they de-accumulated
substantially in 2014 as a result of a terms-of-trade shock. As the macroeconomic conditions
improved during the ECF program, the country managed to raise its reserve cover from less than
four to almost seven months of prospective imports (excluding mining industry imports) between in
2011 and 2012. The overall current account deficit expanded from 6 percent in 2011 to more
30 percent in 2013 owing to a substantial increase in imports by the extractive industry, which now
accounts for more than half of total imports. The non-extractive current account deficit remained
stable at about 30 percent of GDP in the past five years. In the financial account balance, foreign
direct investments used to finance the mining industry expansion increased dramatically from
5 percent of GDP in 2010 to almost 35 percent in 2012. These, in turn, contributed to higher
international reserves. Yet the collapse in the price of iron and other metals, and the resulting
worsening of Mauritania’s terms of trade in 2014, have resulted in the loss of about 25 percent of
foreign reserves to five months of imports.
3.
Mauritania’s external position is undergoing a substantial change from current
account deficits of more than 25 percent of GDP to much smaller ones at about 6 percent of
GDP by 2021. The country’s mining industry is financing (mostly through FDI and to a lesser extent
using long-term external debt) a large investment program that is expected to substantially increase
mining output over the medium term. Virtually all output of the extractive sector is exported and
already accounts for more than three quarters of total exports. The expansion thus translates into a
change of a large FDI-financed current account deficit in 2014, estimated at 24 percent of GDP, into
a much smaller negative deficit of 6 percent in 2021, by which time major projects will have come on
stream. The external balance should then remain at a similar level for the long run. The CGER-like
REER assessment methods rely on steady-state equilibrium values of a country’s external variables,
usually taken to be their medium-term—five years ahead—forecasts. In 2020, the transformation of
Mauritania’s current account will not be quite complete; therefore, the analytical approaches used in

42

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF MAURITANIA

this assessment consider the 2021 value of Mauritania’s current account deficit as an estimate of the
underlying steady-state equilibrium value.
4.
Mauritania’s exchange rate appears to be in line with fundamentals. The CGER-like
macroeconomic balance, external sustainability, and equilibrium REER approaches all suggest the
rate is in line with fundamentals (with an undervaluation of 0.1 percent under the former two and
0.4 percent under the latter method).

5.
In the short term, Mauritania needs to rebuild foreign reserve buffers to mitigate the
impact of possible future external shocks. The country has already suffered a recent terms-oftrade shock, which demonstrated the economy’s vulnerability to swings in global commodity prices,
particularly those for metals. At the same time, Mauritania as a net oil importer has benefited from
the sharp drop in oil prices. Nonetheless, the country had to use a substantial part of its foreign
reserves to weather the impact of the shock. Higher prices of oil or food—the country relies heavily
on food imports to satisfy domestic demand—would bring about another substantial deterioration
in trade and current account balances. Other things equal, a 20 percent rise in world food prices
would result in a 10 percent decrease in Mauritania’s foreign reserves, assuming the shock is fully
absorbed with reserves. Similarly, a 20 percent increase in oil prices would deplete reserves by more
than 15 percent. Because Mauritania is very vulnerable to such external price shocks, both through
its food and oil product imports and commodity exports, it needs to maintain a sufficient level of
foreign reserves to ensure the economy’s stability in the face of exogenous price changes.
Additionally, the country’s optimal level of reserves is between three and six months of overall
imports , whereas under current baseline projections reserves are only forecasted to reach three
months of total imports in 2020 (they will temporarily reach that threshold in 2015 because of a fall
in capital imports as mining expansion projects are delayed). Mauritania thus needs to focus on
rebuilding external buffers over the coming years back to and above the levels seen in 2013.
6.
The exchange rate is not a driver of overall export competitiveness but may affect
employment in the export sector. A large and growing share of Mauritania’s exports comprises
commodities, whose extraction requires little in terms of local factors of production. In particular, the
local labor intensity of the extractive industry is very low, implying that changes in the REER would

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

43

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF MAURITANIA

be unlikely to affect the country’s competitiveness on global commodity markets. At the same time,
Mauritania is attempting to expand its artisanal fish industry precisely because of its high labor
intensity, in order to increase formal employment in a higher value-added sector. A substantial REER
appreciation, which may result from the improvement in the country’s current account balance,
could negatively affect local employment in the export-focused fishing industry.
7.
Non-price measures of structural competitiveness suggest that Mauritania can
improve its external competitiveness substantially through structural reforms. Both the 2014
Doing Business indicators and the 2014–15 Global Competitiveness Index (GCI) show that
Mauritania is lagging behind the average for lower-income countries (LICs) and behind the oil
importers of the MENAP region. The Doing Business survey indicates that access to finance may
present the largest constraint to businesses in the economy, followed by supply of adequate
infrastructure. GCI data, in turn, demonstrate that,
within infrastructure, Mauritania particularly lags
behind other LICs in quality of roads, port, and air
transport infrastructure. The authorities are already
addressing deficiencies in these areas through their
public investment program. Continued well-targeted
and effective improvements—as well as better access
to finance through a more developed financial
system—can ease the operating conditions for local
business and thereby improve their external
competitiveness.

on bank licensing.
Further develop microfinance and Islamic banking.

Weak liquidity management framework

Weak transmission mechanism

Weak coordination between monetary and
FX policies

Eliminate penalties and commissions applied to foreign exchange
auctions, accept all bids to sell on the fixing market and clearly state
the policy for rejecting the bids to sell, shorten the timeframe for
currency transfer transactions after the auction, ensure strict
application of the FX regulation and strengthen sanctions, and increase
transparency on CB intervention and policy by communicating to the
market an intervention range for the next one to three months.
Adopt a multiple-rate auction system with a benchmark rate.
Move to a wholesale auction and develop the IT infrastructure to
better monitor the market.
Enhance transparency by regular publication of banks’ financial
statements; standardize model Islamic contracts for interbank
transactions.
Quarterly update the monetary program tables in order to establish
medium-term monetary objectives and set a daily liquidity forecasting
system.
Widen the range of instruments to manage liquidity (standing facilities,
seven-day Treasury bills), examine issuing Islamic securities, and use
the average for the establishment of the reserve requirement.
Develop a yield curve by separating auctions for Treasury bills and
bonds with different maturities, gradually securitizing the CBM's claims
on the government using marketable securities with longer maturities.
Coordinate the regulatory framework for liquidity and foreign
exchange and banks' liquid assets in ouguiyas, review the CBM's
organizational structure and the division of duties relating to monetary
and currency exchange transactions.

Appendix IV. Mauritania: Statistical Issues
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance.
National Accounts: Following STA recommendations, the National Office of Statistics (ONS) is now
compiling annual national accounts (ANA) at 2009 year prices. Data for 2011–12 is still provisional but
has been incorporated in the macro framework. The ANA broadly follow the 1993 SNA
recommendations. Afritac West is providing technical assistance to complete ANA by mid-2015 and
progress with the compilation of quarterly national accounts.
Price Statistics: Data are published with a delay of less than one month. The current edition of the
consumer price index (CPI), developed with the assistance of AFRISTAT has been published since May
2004. Geographical coverage of the CPI is limited to the capital Nouakchott. The authorities are working
on a new CPI with broader scope to better reflect pricing trends.
Government finance statistics: Key shortcomings include insufficient institutional coverage (coverage
is limited to Budgetary Central Government, albeit in a wide sense that includes the general budget, the
annexed budget, and the special treasury accounts), classification problems, long lags for production of
statistics, and lack of reconciliation of financing with the monetary accounts. Key factors behind these
weaknesses include the lack of financial resources allocated to the compilation of statistics, insufficient
interagency coordination, and concern about accuracy that give rise to reluctance to publish provisional
data. It has however benefited from recent efforts to increase the comprehensiveness of the data
through the adoption of systematic compilation practices. With ongoing methodological
improvements, the authorities should publish monthly statements of treasury accounts.
Monetary statistics: CBM monetary statistics are in line with the statistical methodologies of the
Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual and data dissemination recommendations of the GDDS. More
specifically, CBM developed and implemented bridge tables from source data for monetary statistics to
the new Standardized Report Form (SRFs) for reporting monetary statistics to STA. In parallel, CBM
pursued the implementation of the recommendations of the various IMF safeguards assessment
missions. CBM posts monetary statistics on its official website (the most recent data refer to December
2013). With recent methodological improvements, the CBM is expected to submit monetary data to STA
monthly by using the SRFs 1SR, 2SR, and 5SR beginning with end-January 2010 data onwards, and to
progressively compile SRFs back to December 2001.
Balance of payments: Balance of payments statistics are affected by significant shortcomings, because
many components are routinely based on estimates and there are no systematic efforts to collect data
on certain transfers and foreign direct investment. In addition, non-mining exports, services, and shortterm capital flows are not well measured because the reporting by commercial banks is problematic. TA
from AFRICA West could help address some of these shortcomings.
II. Data Standards and Quality

Mauritania: New National Accounts (1998–2012)
The Mauritanian National Office of Statistics (ONS) recently released revised national accounts
(NA) data for the period 1998–2012. The publication follows efforts supported with Fund technical
assistance from AFRITAC West. Data are definitive for 1998–2010, and provisional for 2011 and 2012.
According to ONS, the new NA are in line with SCN 1993 methodology and better capture the informal
sector which is dominant in the Mauritanian economy. The reported real GDP figures correspond to
chained GDP with 2004 as a base year.
The most visible changes resulting from the revision came in the areas of nominal GDP levels,
real GDP growth rates, and sectoral shares of GDP.

Both the level and the growth rate for nominal GDP are higher. The revised nominal GDP is, on
average, 18 percent higher than the one previously reported. In 2012, nominal GDP rose to UM1.44 billion.
GDP per capita, taking into account the 2013 population survey census, is estimated at about US$1400. The
revised real GDP growth rate is 0.5 percentage point higher on average over 1999–2012 with the main
difference in 2005–06 owing to higher oil production levels in the revised data.


Sectoral composition in GDP has changed
significantly vis-à-vis the previously GDP figures. In
particular, the share of the primary sector—mainly
livestock—increased significantly at the expense of
services. Trade and public administration were the most
affected, with their shares declining respectively by
4.9 percent and 5 percent in 2012 compared to old
national accounts.

Implementation of Post-Catastrophe Debt Relief (PCDR): Not Applicable
Decision point—point at which the IMF and the World Bank determine whether a country qualifies
for assistance under the HIPC Initiative and decide on the amount of assistance to be committed.
Interim assistance—amount disbursed to a country during the period between decision and
completion points, up to 20 percent annually and 60 percent in total of the assistance committed at
the decision point (or 25 percent and 75 percent, respectively, in exceptional circumstances).

3

Assistance committed under the original framework is expressed in net present value (NPV) terms at the
completion point, and assistance committed under the enhanced framework is expressed in NPV terms at the
decision point. Hence these two amounts cannot be added.
4

Under the enhanced framework, an additional disbursement is made at the completion point corresponding to
interest income earned on the amount committed at the decision point but not disbursed during the interim period.
5

The MDRI provides 100 percent debt relief to eligible member countries that qualified for the assistance. Grant
assistance from the MDRI Trust and HIPC resources provide debt relief to cover the full stock of debt owed to the
Fund as of end-2004 that remains outstanding at the time the member qualifies for such debt relief.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF MAURITANIA

Completion point—point at which a country receives the remaining balance of its assistance
committed at the decision point, together with an additional disbursement of interest income as
defined in footnote 2 above. The timing of the completion point is linked to the implementation of
pre-agreed key structural reforms (i.e., floating completion point).
Safeguards Assessments
The latest safeguards assessment of the CBM, completed on April 30, 2010, concluded that
significant risks remain. Action is needed to develop the CBM’s financial reporting, which lags
significantly behind international standards and the practices of other central banks in the region.
The CBM will also need to build capacity in the areas of information systems and internal audit, and
notwithstanding recommendations to improve governance, has no plans to establish an Audit
Committee or require the Board to fulfill its functions.

AML/CFT
The Middle East and North Africa Financial Action Task Force (MENAFATF) adopted the mutual
evaluation report for Mauritania in November 2006, where it recommended corrective measures to
address the deficiencies in the country’s AML/CFT framework. In the ninth follow-up report last
November 2014, the MENAFATF noted the positive steps taken by the authorities, such as Senate
approval of the amended AML/CFT draft law. However they concluded that some core and key
recommendations remain unaddressed, in particular, (a) shortcomings in the legal definition of the
act of terrorist financing; and (b) lack of sufficient procedures to implement United Nations Security
Council Resolutions (UNSCRs) 1267 and 1373 on listing and freezing of terrorist assets. Mauritania
was thus kept under the enhanced follow-up procedures and was asked to report back on new
actions taken at the next Plenary scheduled for end-April 2015. Authorities are committed to
improving the AML/CFT laws to address the identified deficiencies, and have undertaken measures
to expedite procedures for joining the Egmont Group of Financial Intelligence Units as
recommended by the 2012 FATF.
Exchange Arrangement
Mauritania’s de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The de facto exchange rate arrangement
has been reclassified from “other managed” to “stabilized” effective November 20, 2013. Since endMarch the nominal exchange rate against the U.S. dollar has remained within a 2 percent band.
Mauritania maintains one exchange restriction subject to IMF approval under Article VIII of the
Fund’s Articles of Agreement. The exchange restriction arises from the insufficient foreign exchange
availability at the fixing sessions (auctions) organized by the Central Bank of Mauritania (CBM) for
those transactions which are required to be submitted to the auctions. The authorities have
requested, and staff recommends, Board approval for the temporary retention of this restriction.
Last Article IV Consultation
Previous Article IV discussions were held in Nouakchott during April 29–May 16, 2012 together with
the Fourth Review under the Three-Year Extended Credit Facility Arrangement. The Country Report
No. 12/246 was considered by the Executive Board on July 2, 2012.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of December 31, 2014)

Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. Most affected areas
are: national accounts, balance of payments, external debt, and financial sector statistics. Since 2005,
STA and AFRITAC West have been assisting the authorities with macroeconomic statistics.
Mauritania is participating in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS). The metadata has
been posted on the Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB); and ROSC data for most
internationally recognized standards and codes is not available except for fiscal transparency.

Real sector
Under AFRITAC West technical assistance, the National Statistical Office (ONS) released revised
national accounts for 1998-2010 based on 2004 prices, and also produced provisional estimates for
2011-12. The revised national accounts are in compliance with the 1993 System of National
Accounts (1993 SNA), however the ONS is planning to move to SNA 2008 by 2016 and to develop
quarterly national accounts in parallel.
The current consumer price index (CPI), developed with the assistance of AFRISTAT, has been
published since May 2004 with a geographical coverage limited to Nouakchott (the capital). The
authorities plan to update and broaden the consumer basket by using the 2013 consumer survey
titled “Enquete sur la Pauvreté et les Conditions de Vie” (EPCV), and by extending the geographical
coverage to four cities.

Government finance statistics
The adoption of systematic compilation practices has improved data comprehensiveness, but there
is a need to operationalize a data validation process as a quality control measure. In view of ongoing
methodological improvements, the authorities should publish monthly statements of treasury
accounts. Substantial work is needed to move towards GFS2001.
Monetary and financial statistics
CBM monetary statistics are broadly in line with the statistical methodologies of the Monetary and
Financial Statistics Manual and data dissemination recommendations of the GDDS. The CBM
developed and implemented bridge tables from source data to the Standardized Report Form (SRFs)
and since last year submits SRF 1SR (central bank) and 2SR (other financial institutions) to STA on a
preliminary basis. The quality of these data needs to be further enhanced, and the scope of 2SR
should be expanded to cover micro-finance institutions, and the Caisse de Dépôts et de
Développement (CDD) which is a deposit and development fund created in 2011. The CBM should
be moving to prepare its financial reporting system for IFRS implementation, a key safeguards
assessment recommendation. The CBM should also publish monetary statistics on its official website
in a timely manner.

Balance of payments
Balance of payments statistics are affected by significant shortcomings, as many components are
routinely based on estimates, and there are no systematic efforts to collect data on certain types of
transfers, foreign direct investment, or tourism receipts. In addition non mining exports, services and
short-term capital flows are not well measured. Similarly, under-reporting of external transactions by
commercial banks is problematic. No balance of payments statistics are reported to STA. An April
2011 STA TA mission provided recommendations, which, if implemented by the authorities, would
significantly address identified shortcomings.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Approved By
Daniela Gressani and
Dhaneshwar Ghura (IMF)
and John Panzer (IDA)

Prepared by the staffs of the International Monetary Fund
and the International Development Association

Mauritania’s risk of debt distress is rated high due to a breach of the debt-to-GDP ratio threshold
under the baseline scenario. This represents a downgrade from the moderate risk of debt distress
at the time of the 2012 Debt Sustainability Analysis. The downgrade is mostly due to a
combination of higher projected debt disbursements and a more stringent level of the policydependent debt thresholds as measured by the World Bank CPIA score. The expected resolution
of bilateral debt relief with Kuwait and a hike in export-led growth are projected to lower
Mauritania’s debt level and enhance the capacity of carrying debt over the next years; however,
strengthening the quality of policies and institutions—and particularly debt management
capacity—will prove critical to rapidly revert to a moderate risk of debt distress. Overall, external
debt dynamics tend to follow public debt dynamics, while private sector debt represents a modest
portion of external debt.

BACKGROUND
1.
Debt level remains elevated and mostly represented by public and publicly guaranteed
(PPG) debt. Private sector’s access to finance remains limited. Public debt is mostly of an external nature, in
the form of official lending with multilateral or bilateral institutions at concessional terms. Debt peaked
during 2012 as the central government put in place large investment projects to address Mauritania’s
infrastructure gap. The public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) debt includes the debt of the central
government, central bank and few state-owned enterprises (SOEs); and it is mainly constituted of external
debt as the domestic debt is small. The non-publicly guaranteed external debt includes the state-owned
mining company SNIM (which does not need government guarantees) and commercial banks’ debt. In
2012, the PPG external debt rose 7 percentage GDP points to 73½ percent of GDP (2012) due to higher
external debt disbursements for the central government financing of large infrastructure projects and it is
projected to decline to about 52 percent of GDP over the medium term. The non-publicly guaranteed
external debt, at 17 percent of GDP in 2013, has recently increased as SNIM has borrowed externally to
finance its mining expansion plans.
2.
Mauritania’s debt structure remains broadly sound. Despite its high level, Mauritania’s debt
structure remains solid. Debt is contracted with bilateral and multilateral institutions, a stable creditor base,
and mostly at concessional terms. Multilateral and bilateral creditors account for 42 and 46 percent of total
debt, respectively. Mauritania’s exposure to regional Arab lenders, with about 60 percent of the total debt
portfolio, could make it vulnerable to a change in their lending policies. Its debt structure includes very
limited guaranteed borrowing by SOEs and debt is contracted on fixed terms, with long maturities. Sources
of risks in the debt structure relate to foreign currency exposure due to the size of the external debt, as
95 percent of its debt stock is denominated in foreign currency (mainly US dollar, Kuwaiti Dinar, and SDR).
Domestic debt remains small (about 5 percent of stock) and consists of treasury bills for budgetary and
liquidity management purposes. It is, nevertheless, issued at short maturity (up to six months) with some
limited rollover risks. The debt service profile remains stable and relatively benign, but a term-of trade
shock could hamper Mauritania’s ability to servicing its external debt.

The authorities are actively seeking debt relief from Kuwait. An agreement has not yet been
reached on this longstanding issue between the Kuwait Investment Authority (KIA) and Mauritania. Both
parties are seeking agreement about the valuation of the passive debt, including interest in arrears. In
accordance with Paris Club’s debt relief, Mauritania is seeking comparability of treatment consistent with
the HIPC Initiative.

UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS
4.
This debt sustainability analysis (DSA) updates the join IMF-World Bank DSA produced in
June 2012 for the fourth review under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF). The previous DSA concluded
that the risk of debt distress was moderate but borderline high. It also highlighted that the debt dynamics
were subject to risks emanating from country vulnerability to fiscal, FDI, exchange rate fluctuations and
growth shocks, underscoring the need to continue improving debt management to safeguard mediumterm sustainability. Key changes to the DSA inputs since the last exercise are as follows:


Real GDP growth is expected to be higher mainly due to a large expansion in the extractive
industry and in particular in iron mining. Existing and new producers are already undergoing a
large expansion of mining capacity which will increase production capacity from 11,000 to
18,000 tons by 2016. Another planned expansion will bring the country’s extraction capacity to
over 60,000 tons by 2025. The mining projects result in a pronounced hump-shaped investment
plan that will boost growth dynamics over the medium and long term. In addition, scaled-up
public investment in agriculture aims at doubling the arable land.



Current account balances in the long run have been revised to account for the more ambitious
mining expansion plans that could triple iron ore exports over the next ten years against
forecasts of a much smaller 40 percent hike in the last DSA. In particular, during 2016-20,
substantial FDI-financed current account deficits are projected as the mining capacity is
expanded; to be followed by a sharp improvement as investment-related imports abate and

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF MAURITANIA

exports expand, before stabilizing at a long-run level marginally better than forecast in the 2012
DSA (between 4 and 5 percent of GDP).
Level of GDP has been revised upwards as the authorities improved the national account
statistics with the help of technical assistance from the AFRITAC West. On average, GDP has
increased by about 20 percent compared to previously reported GDP series used in the previous
DSA. Average real GDP growth will average 7 percent over the medium term and expected to
anchor around 6 percent afterwards.



Metal prices have considerably changed since the previous DSA. Mauritania benefitted until
recently from high iron ore prices and positive terms of trade. Iron prices sharply decreased
during 2014 both due to a rise in global mining capacity and lower global demand (mainly
driven by the heightened uncertainty associated with China and Europe’s growth prospects).
Medium-term projections suggest iron ore prices about 32 percent lower than forecasted at the
time of the 2012 DSA (at US$72 per ton). Therefore, medium-run terms of trade are therefore
expected to deteriorate relative to the expectations at the time of the last DSA.



Public financing needs have increased as the authorities have embarked on a program of
public investments, with central government capital expenditure averaging over 12 percent of
non-extractive GDP in the coming

average have to be maintained
for at least 2 years to have an effect on the DSA.1 According to this rule, Mauritania’s debt ratio
thresholds have moved down to the weak institutional performers in this DSA due to the lagged
impact of the low CPIA score the country received in 2011. This includes a move from 40 to
30 percentage points for the ratio of the present value of PPG external debt to GDP. The latest
three-year average CPIA score (at 3.24 for 2011-13) has now been below the threshold for weak
performers of 3.25 for over two years (which had not been the case at the time of the 2012
DSA). This precipitated the reclassification.2



KIA debt relief is assumed to take place in 2015 and incorporated into the analysis since
Mauritania had reached the HIPC completion point. The last DSA assumed the debt relief to take
place in 2012.

EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT
5.
PPG external debt ratios remain below indicative thresholds in the baseline scenario over
the medium term except for the debt-to-GDP ratio (Figure 1 and Tables 1 and 2). The debt profile of
the country has improved relative to the 2012 DSA despite the higher projected disbursements mainly due
to the upward revision of the GDP3. Yet under the baseline scenario, the ratio of PV of PPG external debt to

The methodology is described in https://www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2013/110513.pdf. The new methodology
incorporates, among others, revised debt thresholds and benchmarks for public sector debt, and revised guidance
for the incorporation of remittances in the DSA. The latter is, however, not relevant in Mauritania due to low private
remittances.
2

The use of the 3-year moving average aims at avoiding frequent changes in the risk of external debt distress ratings
as a result of small changes in the CPIA around the thresholds used to determine the institutional quality
classification. If only the current CPIA rating (at 3.3) were used, Mauritania would have maintained the moderate risk
of debt distress.
3

With the new national accounts, GDP numbers have been revised upwards by 20 percent on average, and the 2013
PPG external debt-to-GDP ratio has been revised from 84 percent to 69.2 percent.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

5

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF MAURITANIA

GDP breaches its threshold through 2025 because this threshold has been lowered to 30 percent from
40 percent due to the reclassification of the country’s institutional quality. The ratio will reach slightly over
39 percent in 2015-16 (after a decline due to the assumed KIA debt relief) and then decline slowly to
stabilize at around 35 percent. The decrease over time is driven by the pick-up in exports which will
translate into both stronger growth and fiscal revenues. The breach of the relevant threshold by the ratio of
PV of PPG external debt to GDP is, at over 9 percentage points in 2015, somewhat larger but much more
sustained than the breach of the threshold for the same ratio in the 2012 DSA.
6.
Standardized stress tests lead to breaches of three debt ratio thresholds and point to the
vulnerability of projected debt reduction to both domestic and external factors. A currency devaluation
and failure to secure the projected non-debt creating flows would be particularly damaging to the ratios,
even though the latter would probably be partially offset by lower imports.
7.
The historical scenario produces unrealistically large swings in the level of projected external
debt. This result is driven by the large discrepancy between changes in external debt and identified net
debt-creating flows in the baseline scenario. This scenario involves a substantial change in the current
account balance from a large FDI-financed deficit while the mining capacity is being expanded in the short
run to a much diminished one once mining exports have increased. A large portion of the projected current
account deficits in the short run will be financed by SNIM and a substantial share of the improvement in
current account balances in the medium run will accrue to SNIM. The former will not raise the PPG external
debt and the latter will not be necessarily used to rapidly decrease the external indebtedness of the
sovereign. The large residuals in the analysis arise from the fact that a large share of SNIM’s project
financing as well as use of the resulting higher export proceeds is unlikely to fall under the identified net
debt-creating flow categories, which include non-interest current account balance.
8.
The outlook for overall external debt has worsened in absolute terms compared to the last
DSA. This can be attributed to the public external borrowing disbursements planned for infrastructure
projects as well as increased borrowing from SNIM—whose significant debt-financed expansion plans
could further raise external debt vulnerabilities. In addition, the 2012 DSA assumed that the now-delayed
KIA debt relief would have been completed by this point.

PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT
9.
Indicators of overall public debt (external and domestic) and debt service mirrors the
vulnerabilities associated with the external debt. The total public debt mildly breaches its indicative
benchmark after the assumed KIA debt relief even though the breach steadily declines over the forecast
horizon. The stress scenarios show that this projection is particularly vulnerable to currency depreciation
and depends on the materialization of the expected export-led growth.
10.
Overall public debt is largely comprised of PPG external debt. Almost 90 percent of total
public debt in Mauritania is PPG external debt. Domestic public debt has hovered around 5 to 7 percent of
GDP and is not a significant contributing factor to the overall public debt level.

CONCLUSION
11.
Mauritania’s risk of external debt distress has increased due to a combination of the
reclassification of its institutional capacity and higher projected new debt disbursements. The new
institutional capacity classification has resulted in lowering of Mauritania’s debt thresholds, including from
40 to 30 percentage points for the ratio of the present value of PPG external debt to GDP. As a result of a
baseline breach due to a lower threshold, the risk of debt distress has increased from moderate to high. In
addition, the projected disbursement path in the coming years will increase PPG external debt level. The
projected KIA debt relief will not, in itself, resolve breaching the threshold for the ratio of PV of PPG external
debt to GDP. In the medium term, increased exports and the resulting output growth should decrease the
country’s debt burden. The outlook would worsen substantially should the projected increases in exports
and the subsequent higher growth and improvements in current account balances not materialize, in
particular due to delays to or cancellations of mining capacity expansion plans.
12.
Given the challenges of reducing debt rapidly, Mauritania needs to continue improving its
institutional environment to quickly return to a moderate risk of debt distress. An anticipated debt
relief and a hike in export-led growth are projected to lower Mauritania’s debt level and enhance the
capacity of carrying debt over the next years; but debt management capacity needs to be strengthened.
Given that under the baseline a breach of a threshold occurs for the duration of the projection period,
Mauritania could gain substantially from a stronger institutional environment to increase the debt tolerance
level. Within the categories of institutions considered by the CPIA score, Mauritania has largest scope for
improvement in debt policy, financial sector, social protection and transparency in the public sector. The
country should therefore, among other measures, redouble its efforts to implement a social protection
framework that would help the socially vulnerable. Elsewhere, following the recommendation of the recent
FSAP exercise should aid Mauritania in improving its financial sector institutions.
13.
Recent technical assistance from AFRITAC-West provides recommendations to improve
debt management practices which both bear on the overall CPIA score and is directly linked to
Mauritania’s debt management capacity. The technical assistance mission assessed that debt management
in Mauritania is fragmented and the relevant operational responsibilities are shared and duplicated. The
authorities should therefore reorganize the functions of the various departments of the Ministry of
Economic Affairs and Development, Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank that participate in debt
management to increase the efficiency and coordination in debt contraction and management.
14.
The authorities do not agree with the reclassification of the country’s quality of policies and
institutions into the weak category as a function of the past CPIA scores, which has a direct bearing
on the change in the country’s risk of external debt distress from medium to high. In particular, they
believe the methodology in the joint Bank-Fund Debt Sustainability Framework for low-income countries
places too much weight in its assessment of institutional quality on the past and too little on the present.
The country’s institutional quality is being downgraded at a point in time when the CPIA has both been
increasing for 3 consecutive years and has risen above the 3.25 minimum level required for medium quality
of institutions. This means that the risk of the external debt distress is being increased while the actual
institutional quality is improving and the macroeconomic environment remained stable.

Sources: Country authorities; and staff estimates and projections.
1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the
baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after
the shock (implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with the Islamic Republic of
Mauritania

On January, 28, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with Mauritania.
In recent years, Mauritania’s economy has benefited from macroeconomic stability and high
growth in the context of contained inflation, responsible macro policies, high iron ore prices,
windfall donor assistance, and scaled-up public investment. Real GDP growth is estimated at 6.4
percent in 2014, from 5.7 percent in 2013 owing to a rebound in the fishing sector. The current
account deficit has remained at 25 percent of GDP during 2013–14 owing to large capital
imports associated with investments in the extractive sector and, lately, to worsening terms of
trade. International reserves, which remained at 6½ months of prospective imports, excluding
those related to the extractive industries in 2013, have absorbed the deterioration of the terms of
trade, declining to 4.7 months in 2014. The overall balance, excluding grants, posted a deficit of
2.2 percent of non-extractive GDP in 2013, down from 3.0 percent in 2012, but deteriorated to
4.7 percent of non-extractive GDP in 2014 on lower revenues, mainly mining revenues from
SNIM, the public mining company. Monetary indicators suggest a moderate increase in credit.
The Financial System Stability Assessment (FSSA) concluded that the banking sector is well
capitalized and liquid, but remains fragile to shocks. High credit concentration (including credit
to the public sector), foreign exchange risk exposures, and low profitability due to a constrained
business model and higher competition exacerbate banking vulnerabilities. While the banking
system appears well capitalized overall, some banks are not meeting the minimum capital
requirement and are under-provisioned. Asset quality remains weak with nonperforming loans
representing 20 percent of loans in the second quarter of 2014.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A
staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country's economic
developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board.

2
The near-term outlook remains favorable despite slower economic activity and lower iron ore
prices. Real GDP growth is projected to decline to 5.5 percent in 2015 because of lower growth
in mining activity and lower private investment and consumption. Terms of trade are projected to
deteriorate by 4.5 percent as lower iron ore prices (by 24 percent) are partially compensated by
the decline in oil prices (of 40 percent). Inflation is expected to accelerate somewhat but remain
below 5 percent, favored by the decline in international food prices and lower non-extractive
GDP growth. Continued appreciation in real terms could result in higher private sector demand.
Medium-term prospects remain promising: Mauritania’s large resource endowment provides
ample opportunities for development. Structural reforms are essential to generate more growth
and jobs and to address the challenges of economic diversification, inequality, and
unemployment.
Risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside and dominated by global developments. Spillovers
from weakening external demand for commodities could further reduce iron ore prices and
mining export revenues. Larger-than-envisaged declines in main export prices would further
reduce exports and FDI and cast doubts on mining expansion plans, dimming growth prospects
and worsening fiscal balances. External shocks could expose vulnerabilities in the banking
system, exacerbating a negative shock to growth and financial stability.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended the Mauritanian authorities for policies that have secured
macroeconomic stability and supported development in recent years. Directors noted, however,
that the risks from further declines in iron ore prices and weak activity in key trading partners
cloud the outlook for the near term. Accordingly, they encouraged the authorities to persevere
with prudent policymaking and the implementation of institutional and structural reforms to
boost the economy’s resilience and foster more inclusive growth.
Directors welcomed progress with fiscal consolidation and the improved revenue performance.
They agreed that the 2015 budget mitigates shortfalls in mining revenue, but considered that
additional measures may be needed if the budget comes under pressure. Directors also stressed
the importance of strengthening public financial management to reduce the risk of debt distress.
Looking ahead, they underscored the need to improve the fiscal framework over the medium
term to enhance the management of resource wealth and support macrostability. They
recommended implementing an appropriate fiscal rule that takes into consideration the
development needs of the country and helps safeguard the budget from boom-bust cycles of
natural resource revenue, while reinforcing fiscal governance.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive
Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can
be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

3
Directors encouraged the authorities to take advantage of the favorable inflation environment to
reinforce Mauritania’s monetary framework by strengthening liquidity management. They also
noted that prompt recapitalization of the central bank is essential to safeguard its credibility and
independence. Directors emphasized the importance of a gradual liberalization of the foreign
exchange market, noting that greater exchange rate flexibility would help absorb external shocks
and support the reconstitution of reserve buffers. They welcomed the authorities’ steps toward
compliance with Article VIII obligations, and encouraged them to eliminate the remaining
exchange restriction as soon as possible.
Directors underscored the need to further strengthen the stability of the financial system. They
welcomed the authorities’ intention to implement the recommendations of the recent Financial
System Stability Assessment. Priorities include strengthening regulatory enforcement and
supervisory independence, expanding central bank supervision to cover public banks and the
insurance sector, and enhancing the bank resolution framework.
Directors encouraged the authorities to accelerate reforms to promote private sector development
and economic diversification, which would boost employment and reduce poverty. In particular,
they recommended working closely with development partners to address infrastructure
bottlenecks, invest in human capital and education, improve governance and institutions, and
deepen financial inclusion.

INTRODUCTION

Mauritania has made significant progress in recent years towards both raising economic
growth and achieving macroeconomic stability. Real GDP growth averaged over
5 percent in the past decade owing to the exploitation of the country’s large fishing and
mineral resources, most notably iron ore but also copper and gold. Fiscal revenues rose
significantly, and sound macroeconomic management along with the mining sector’s
rapid expansion has enabled the buildup of sizable external and fiscal buffers. While
prudent policies and a favorable external environment have played a key role, my
authorities also recognize and appreciate the support and candid policy advice of staff
and the Fund, over the years, in this improved performance.
Mauritania also made some progress in the area of poverty reduction, including through
improved targeting of social safety nets and investment in key social projects to address
the country’s immense infrastructure gap. They acknowledge, however, that much
remains to be done in this area. In particular, as noted in the report, progress towards the
MDGs has been mixed. They would like nonetheless to reiterate that the fight against
poverty remains at the center of their development agenda and that they will continue to
promote growth-enhancing polices that are also inclusive in nature, in order to address
the population’s large social needs and provide employment opportunities, especially for
the youth. They are aware that reaching their ambitious objectives in this area requires
continued improvement in the country’s business climate and renewed efforts to
accelerate the development of the private sector.
Given the importance of natural resources in Mauritania’s economy, its recent
performance and the economic outlook has been adversely affected by the steep decline
in the international prices of the main commodities exported and the economic slowdown
in key trading partners. These external developments constitute the key downside risk to
the Mauritania’s outlook. However, my authorities expect that the country’s external
buffers built in recent years and the lower international oil and food prices (Mauritania
being a net importer of both) will help mitigate the impact of external shocks. Going
forward, they view as their key short-term challenge, the implementation of welldesigned policies to address these external risks, while preserving the hard-won
macroeconomic gains, as buffers are being increasingly used. Negotiations on the EU
fishing compensation are ongoing and my authorities expect an agreement that will be
mutually beneficial to all parties.
Over the longer term, the focus as rightly underscored by staff will be to enhance the
economy’s resilience to shocks, including through the imperative diversification of the
economy away from natural resources. My authorities share the overall assessment by
staff along with the key identified challenges which they intend to address in close
coordination with the Fund and other key partners.

II.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK

Growth: While real GDP growth is projected to slowdown slightly to 5.5 percent in 2015,
from 6.4 percent in 2014, the external and fiscal sectors will be the most affected by the
decline in the international prices of iron ore, copper, and gold exported by Mauritania.
External sector: The substantial deterioration in the terms of trade and large FDI-related
imports are having a significant adverse impact on the trade and current account balances,
and on the level of foreign exchange reserves (dropping from 6.6 months of imports
cover in 2013 to 4.7 months in 2014) despite the favorable effect of lower international
oil and food prices.
Fiscal sector: The fiscal deficit is estimated to have widened to 3.9 percent of GDP in
2014, from 1.7 percent in 2013, despite the decline in both current and capital
expenditures. This is due in part to the drop in the contribution of SNIM (the national
iron ore mining company) and other mining companies to the budget.
Inflation: It remains in check and is expected to stay moderate over the medium-term
(within the approximate 4-5 percent range) thanks to lower international food and fuel
prices, and a prudent monetary policy stance.
Outlook: In spite of the fall in iron ore prices and slower economic activity, the short- and
medium-term outlook remains broadly favorable. Real GDP over the medium-term is
expected to average over 6 percent reflecting in part increased mining activity coming
from new mines. The fiscal deficit is projected to narrow gradually from 1.9 percent of
non-extractive GDP in 2015 to 1.3 percent by 2013. The buildup of international reserves
is projected to resume in 2015 to reach 6.5 months of imports cover by 2019.

POLICY ADJUSTMENTS TO EXTERNAL RISKS

While the outlook remains favorable, the economy faces important risks in the near to
medium-term, and my authorities will continue to work closely with staff to design and
implement the necessary policies that will help preserve macroeconomic stability and
continued economic growth.
Fiscal policy adjustments: My authorities are addressing the projected decline in
revenues from the mining sector in the 2015 budget through an increase in the VAT rate
(from 14 to 16 percent) and cuts in current expenditures, while containing the increase in
the public sector wages within a level that does not increase the ratio of the wage bill as a
percentage of non-extractive GDP. The wage bill is actually projected to decline to 8.3
percent of non-extractive GDP in 2015, from 8.4 percent in 2014 and 9 percent in 2013.
As a medium- to long-term fiscal policy reform, my authorities very much welcomed the
discussion on a fiscal rule in a country like Mauritania with relatively abundant mineral
resources. However, they would like to emphasize that on the issue of pro-cyclicality of
fiscal policy, it is important to note, first, that while spending had increased during the

recent mining sector boom, budget revenues from non-extractive industries as a share of
GDP have also increased substantially, as my authorities continued to broaden the tax
base and strengthen fiscal revenue administration. Second, and more importantly, my
authorities believe that the implementation of a fiscal rule in a low-income country like
Mauritania with considerable basic social infrastructure needs would inevitably delay the
implementation of their development agenda and ultimately weigh on the ongoing policy
efforts to accelerate the fight against poverty. Therefore, in the short-term, they believe
that the focus should remain on implementing projects that are deemed viable and that
take into account the country’s absorptive capacity constraints. Nonetheless, they look
forward to continued constructive discussions with staff on this issue, as a potential and
significant long-term reform.
Monetary policy and exchange rate policy adjustments: My authorities agree with staff
that with declining foreign exchange reserves, now is a right time to strengthen the
monetary policy framework and reestablish the use of more direct and traditional
liquidity management instruments such as interest rates and reserve requirements, and
limit the use of indirect instruments like foreign exchange interventions and Treasury
bills. They look forward to continue discussions with staff on the formalization of
monetary policy and the liquidity management framework. My authorities also agree that
in the context of declining reserves, a more flexible exchange rate would contribute to
acting as shock absorber. They are of the view, however, that given Mauritania’s very
shallow foreign exchange market, characterized by considerably higher demand over
supply, the liberalization of the foreign exchange market should remain gradual.
My authorities welcome the assessment of Mauritania’s financial sector stability and
thank staff for the findings and recommendations made in the FSSA report. They would
like to reiterate their commitment to implementing the recommendations made in the
report, as rapidly as possible, and according to the agreed timeframe.

OTHER ISSUES

Deterioration of the risk of debt distress: Mauritania’s public sector debt has risen to an
estimated 78.4 of GDP in 2014 (from 73.7 percent in 2013). The downward revision of
the country’s risk of debt distress (from moderate to high) is a concern to my authorities,
especially given that this revision is taking place at a time when they are facing daunting
external challenges which are having an immediate and direct impact on the economy.
They remain committed however to a prudent external borrowing policy and look
forward to further discussions with the IMF and the World Bank on improving the
institutional environment and stabilizing debt levels, including in the context of the new
public debt limits policy framework.
Obligations under Article VIII: My authorities take note of the report’s findings and will
continue to address the remaining restrictions highlighted in the report, with a view to
meeting all obligations under Article VIII. In the meantime, they request the Board’s
approval to temporarily maintain the remaining exchange restriction which, as indicated
by staff, is necessary for balance of payments reasons and does not discriminate among

IMF members. As also indicated in the report, my authorities will eliminate the
remaining restrictions within one year.
V.

CONCLUSION

Mauritania has made important progress in the past few years in improving economic and
financial performance, and raising economic growth. However, the economy faces
important challenges in the foreseeable future resulting from increased external risks
which have exposed the economy’s vulnerability to terms of trade shocks and could
jeopardize the recent hard-won macroeconomic stability gains. In this regard, my
authorities will continue to work closely with staff to put in place the necessary policies
to address the risks, preserve the gains achieved and also continue their efforts to develop
the economy. In this endeavor, they will work closely with the Fund staff and their
development partners.
