EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Central African Republic (C.A.R.) has recorded modest economic growth in the postconflict period (after 2004). Income per capita is starting to recover after years of decline.
In 2008 and early 2009, a series of domestic and external shocks—unstable power supply,
higher prices for imported commodities, and the global recession—slowed growth,
accelerated inflation, and led to higher current account deficits.
Recent performance suggests a modest recovery, owing in part to the implementation of the
government’s reform program. Real GDP growth is projected to increase from 2 percent in
2009 to 3½ percent in 2010 with average CPI inflation slowing toward 2¼ percent. Recovery
in external demand may take time, but the current account balance will improve in 2010 as
aid flows rise.
Fiscal performance was broadly on track. The government continued its domestic revenue
mobilization efforts, controlled spending, and cleared arrears, and largely refrained from
expensive domestic borrowing. Fiscal structural reforms progressed, though with delays in
some areas. Given pending elections and the challenging peace process, it will be important
to sustain the reform momentum.
The 2009–10 fiscal program is still designed to support domestic demand, finance the peace
process and the election, and mobilize more revenue. Domestic revenue in 2010 is expected
to be stable at 10.5 percent of GDP, but expenditure is projected to increase moderately,
resulting in a primary domestic deficit of 1.2 percent of GDP, up from 0.4 percent in 2009.
Structural reform measures are targeted to supporting the macro-fiscal framework through
better public financial management (PFM), strengthening policy implementation capacity,
and addressing infrastructure supply bottlenecks.
Medium-term policy should focus on measures to accelerate economic growth and strengthen
competitiveness while keeping debt sustainable. Alleviating infrastructure bottlenecks and
security concerns, improving the investment climate, and enhancing private sector access to
credit are vital to growth prospects. Meeting the large infrastructure and development
spending needs will require greater efforts to mobilize domestic revenues, prudent debt
management, and increased donor support on concessional terms.
Staff recommends completion of the fifth review of the PRGF arrangement. Program
implementation has been broadly satisfactory; implementation capacity is improving; and the
policy framework is appropriate. Staff supports a waiver for the performance criterion (PC)
on commercial bank credit to the government based on the corrective action taken.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
The C.A.R. has recorded modest economic growth since conflict ended, but the
economy remains vulnerable to a variety of shocks. Despite CAR’s rich endowment in
natural resources and arable land, political instability since independence is still affecting
economic performance. After declining for nearly two decades, per-capita real GDP only
started to recover in 2003 when the conflict ended (Figure 1). Fund financial assistance and
policy advice under the two Emergency Post-Conflict Assistance and the current Poverty
Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangements have helped economic recovery. In
2008, the economy was affected by both external and domestic shocks, and growth slowed,
inflation accelerated, and the current account balance deteriorated (Text Table 1). Despite
these shocks, however, the government has pursued its fiscal program of mobilizing domestic
revenues, controlling spending, and clearing arrears. Improving the credibility of public
financial management (PFM) has been a major achievement of the government’s economic
reform program.

C.A.R. is slowly recovering from the global economic crisis. Exports initially
declined significantly, but demand for wood products and diamonds appears to be picking
up. Tax revenue growth has slowed, but the tax-to-GDP ratio continues to head upward.
Insufficient resources, particularly in the form of grants, make it hard for C.A.R. to
implement its poverty reduction strategy.

Peace and the electoral process are advancing. However, the disarmament,
demobilization, and reintegration (DDR) program to consolidate the peace process following
the inclusive political dialogue has been slow to start, and appointment of the Independent
Electoral Commission was delayed. Some external financing from the UN and CEMAC has
been secured and integrated into the revised 2009 budget; more is needed to fully finance the
DDR process and the general elections in early 2010.
4.
The government intends to step up structural reforms to foster medium-term
growth. Better PFM, reduced customs exemptions, streamlined VAT refund procedures, and
strengthened tax audits are among the reform priorities. The next reform phase will focus on
full implementation of the government financial management information system (GFMIS)
and on liquidity management. To enhance growth prospects, the authorities need to promote
private sector development and mobilize additional donor support for infrastructure
rehabilitation, particularly in the energy sector.
II. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND PROGRAM PERFORMANCE
A. Recent Developments
5.
The C.A.R. economy is now bottoming out. Exports for wood products and
diamonds are pointing upward, although volumes are still far below those of 2008 (Figure 2).
Thanks in part to lower timber taxes, all forestry companies stayed in business, helping to
sustain production capacity and employment. Real GDP growth in 2009 is expected to be
2 percent; it was 2.2 percent in 2008 (Figure 3). Inflation year-on-year fell to 1.7 percent in
September as food price increases moderated; the average CPI is expected to slow to
3½ percent in 2009, from 9¼ percent in 2008.

6.
The external current account is expected to improve in 2009. The current account
deficit worsened by about 4 percentage points to 10 percent of GDP in 2008. It is expected to
reverse moderately in 2009, reflecting improvements in the terms of trade—favored by
rebounding diamond prices—and lower oil import volume following the sale of the large oil

9
reserves accumulated last year (Figure 4). Gross official reserves are projected to increase as
a result of the SDR allocation and the augmentation of PRGF access. Broad money is
expected to increase by 1 percent because private sector credit demand is weak.

B. Program Performance and Outlook for 2009
7.
Fiscal performance was in line with the program. All performance criteria (PCs)
but one were met (Text Table 2). Total domestic revenues increased despite the difficult
environment; revenue reforms are working, and the revenue-to-GDP ratio is projected to
increase to 10.5 percent of GDP, up from 8.2 percent in 2005 (Figure 5). The domestic
primary surplus target was met with a sizable margin, mainly because DDR expenditure was
postponed and there were delays in capital projects but also due to tight controls on
expenditures (Figure 6). The PC on net credit from commercial banks was not met, mainly
because of a delay in the transfer of government resources from the BEAC to commercial
banks. As a corrective action the authorities have started requiring weekly recommendations
by the liquidity commission on how to adjust fiscal policy to meet this quantitative target
(MEFP ¶8). The quantitative benchmarks (QBs) on the net accumulation of tax arrears,
reduction of expenditure arrears, and social spending were met. The QB on fully paying for
government utility consumption was missed; because those bills were unpaid until late
November, the three major utility companies narrowly missed the QB on the cash collectionto-billing ratio.

The authorities have made progress in integrating revenue administration and
computerizing expenditure management. The tax administration computer system,
SYSTEMIF, was connected to the customs administration’s ASYCUDA++ system to share
taxpayer information (end-June 2009 SB, Text Table 3), and efforts are under way to enhance
the usage and usefulness of data exchange. Introducing the integrated GFMIS, Gesco, is still a
major PFM endeavor. The authorities have now secured the World Bank technical and financial
support and are expected to extend Gesco to all stages of the expenditure process (end-2009 SB).
More efforts are needed to train all users and to work toward generalized use of the system.
9.
Government’s relations with the banking sector were streamlined. All government
receipts are now deposited in the main treasury account at the BEAC, thus meeting the end-June
SB. The revised conventions with commercial banks consolidated government liabilities,
established a repayment schedule, and lowered the average interest rate on the debt. On the
advice of the November 2009 FAD PFM review mission, the authorities are expected to
complete implementation of a treasury single account (TSA) at the BEAC by year-end (SB). All

12
government guarantees issued now need to be signed by the Minister of Finance and be fully
recorded as debt, but the legal basis for government guarantees will be adjusted only after the
2010 budget law is adopted.

REVENUE ADMINISTRATION AND TAX
POLICY

PUBLIC FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT

Sources: C.A.R. authorities; IMF staff assessment

The authorities applied the petroleum price adjustment mechanism in line with
program revenue objectives. In July, they kept individual petroleum prices unchanged because
they thought that they would meet the benchmark in terms of revenues. However, in retrospect,
they lost a marginal 0.004 percent of GDP in revenue for that month compared to what was
programmed (MEFP ¶9). Nevertheless, they met the fuel-related revenue target for the first half
of the year thanks to above-minimum excises in the second quarter, higher consumption and a
larger proportion of fuel imported by river rather than road. In October 2009 the authorities

increased some petroleum product prices and ended subsidies on kerosene. Although the price
increases did not satisfy the minimum excise for every single product, the deviation was very
small and the projected revenue meets the programmed 2009 revenue target. Staff therefore
considers the SB to have been effectively met.
III. ECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND PROGRAM OBJECTIVES
A. Macroeconomic Outlook and Article IV Issues
11.
The global slowdown has jeopardized C.A.R.’s short-term growth prospects. The
authorities agreed that chances for external demand to recover quickly are limited, although
longer-term growth prospects seem favorable (Box 1). Domestic supply will remain constrained
by infrastructure bottlenecks, security concerns, and an uncertain business climate. Real GDP
growth is projected to increase to 3½ percent in 2010, and with stable food and fuel prices
average CPI inflation should fall to about 2½ percent (Figure 7).
Box 1. Central African Republic: Long-Term Growth and its Determinants
Authorities and staff agreed that C.A.R. has the potential to accelerate growth to 5–6 percent over the long term
(2010–30) consistent with the results of a growth accounting exercise (Box Table 1). This tracks the experience
of other post-conflict countries. Alternative scenarios, which suggest some risks to growth, underscore the
importance of building up the capital stock by increasing public investment and attracting foreign investment.
The baseline scenario assumes that:
•

Real capital stock growth would average 5.1 percent based on a depreciation rate of 10 percent and
investment as in the last DSA. A depreciation rate of 5 percent would raise average real growth of the
economy by 0.6 percent; a rate of 15 percent would lower it by 0.4 percent.

•

C.A.R.’s labor growth rate could average 4.2 percent during 2010–30 compared with a UN population
projection of growth of the 15-59 age group at 2.1 percent due to a decline in under- and
unemployment. The unemployment rate is assumed to gradually fall from 40 percent now to 10 percent
in 2030.

•

Total factor productivity growth will be 1 percent.

While in the baseline scenario C.A.R.’s GDP
Box Table 1. C.A.R.: Long-Term Growth 1
growth is 5.5 percent, there are risks related to the
labor force and capital stock growth (see

growth is only 5.0 percent each for public and
private capital formation growth, respectively. These scenarios are not necessarily unrealistic given C.A.R.’s
poor business regulatory environment. To achieve higher growth, more efforts will be needed to improve the
investment climate and to finance infrastructure domestically or through external grants.

The external current account deficit is expected to improve to 7½ percent of GDP in
2010. Export volumes should rebound gradually. However, with imports increasing because of
higher international oil prices and volumes, an accelerating public investment, and increased
current fiscal spending on the peace program and the elections, the trade deficit is projected to
increase, though only moderately. Net private inflows are projected to decline relative to what
was programmed because of the delayed start of major mining investments. The resulting
balance of payments deficit will mean a loss of official foreign reserves in 2010.
13.
In recent years inflation has been higher in C.A.R. than in trading partners, leading
to an appreciation of the real exchange rate. C.A.R. is a member of the CEMAC currency
union, and the real exchange rate for CEMAC is considered appropriately valued. However,
there is some concern about C.A.R.’s external competitiveness that is related more to the
business climate than the real exchange rate, which could also be considered as broadly in line
with fundamentals. Foreign investment and domestic supply are constrained by infrastructure
bottlenecks, security concerns, and an uncertain business climate, which have been the subject of
advice in previous and present Article IV discussions (Text Table 4), particularly with respect to
improving the investment climate, by strengthening the legal framework and security of
contracts.

The banking system and private sector access to bank financing need to be
strengthened. Financial intermediation in C.A.R. is among the lowest in the world. Private
sector credit represents only 6½ percent of GDP, though it should expand moderately in 2010
and beyond as the banks shift from financing the government to financing the private sector.
Based on positive experience with paying salaries through banks, the government will work
toward progressively replacing cash and check payments with bank transactions, which should
also encourage expansion of the formal economy. The mission also discussed ways to
sustainably increase private sector access to credit (see Box 2).
Box 2. Central African Republic: Improving Access to Bank Financing
The lack of adequate financing institutions in C.A.R. is a major constraint on private sector development:
1. Financial intermediation is shallow. The consolidated balance sheet of banks amounts to the equivalent of
12½ percent of GDP, while bank deposits represent only 8½ percent of GDP. Bank credit to the private sector
represents 42 percent of broad money, as compared to 75.9 percent for sub-Saharan Africa as a whole.
2. Bank lending activities are constrained by legal and regulatory weaknesses and the short-term structure of
deposits. Bank credit is mainly channeled to short-term operations and is seldom offered to small and mediumsize enterprises.
3. Bank loan portfolios are of poor quality. Nonperforming loans (NPLs) represent 30 percent of total bank
credit, and only 52 percent of NPLs are provisioned. As a result, bank profitability is reduced and bank loan
conditions are stringent.
4. Large deficit financing operations have crowded out private sector borrowing.
The following could help increase the contribution of local banks to growth:
•

Improve the legal and court systems to guarantee property ownership and speed up resolution of
business conflicts and enforcement of collateral.

•

Strengthen bank capital and provisioning for NPLs and continue reducing government demand for
bank credit.

•

Foster payment of taxes and government outlays through the banking system.

•

Adopt a national strategy for microfinance development and establish licensing of certified public
accountants.

15.
Keeping debt sustainable will require prudent debt management and stronger
external sector performance. The debt sustainability analysis (DSA) conducted in the context
of the HIPC completion point shows that the main risk of debt distress is associated with a
relatively high net present value (NPV) of external debt-to-export ratio. Based on simulations
using the DSA, staff showed that even relatively modest external borrowing (e.g., concessional
external borrowings of 2 percent of GDP a year) would bring this ratio close to the relevant
threshold for C.A.R. Staff and the authorities agreed that, post-HIPC relief, there is a need to
raise more domestic revenue, strengthen external sector performance through diversification and
an improved investment climate, and raise policy performance and institutional capacity.

17
B. Program Objectives
Fiscal framework
16.
The fiscal program for the rest of 2009 is essentially unchanged except for moving
some peace-related expenditures into 2010 (Text Table 5). The revised 2009 budget, approved
in September, is consistent with the fiscal program. Domestic revenues are unchanged as a
percent of GDP, but higher tax revenues resulting from improved tax administration are
offsetting projected declines in nontax revenues. Most DDR expenditure will be postponed to
2010, lowering current primary expenditures. Payment of all government utility bills received
until August 2009 is a prior action. Investment spending is projected to be lower because of
implementation delays. Thus with spending shifted into 2010, the primary domestic balance
deficit in 2009 compared to program is expected to improve by 0.5 percentage points of GDP, to
0.4 percent of GDP.

17.
Fiscal policy in 2010 continues to be geared to stabilizing demand through
government spending while preserving medium-term fiscal discipline. Current primary
spending will increase temporarily in conjunction with the delayed implementation (mostly
donor-financed) of the peace process and the elections. The domestic primary deficit will
increase to 1.2 percent of GDP (0.5 percent of GDP was initially programmed), which is more
than fully explained by the 2009 overperformance and additional program grants. The overall
deficit including grants on a cash basis is slightly smaller despite larger projected arrears
repayments in 2010.
18.
Domestic revenue in 2010, as in 2009, is projected at 10.5 percent of GDP. With
planned improvements in tax administration—publication of a tax administration reform strategy
is an SB for end-March 2010—the tax revenue ratio is projected to increase by 0.3 percentage
point of GDP in 2010. However, nontax revenue is reduced by a similar amount because several
extraordinary receipts will not reoccur. Revenue in 2010 is projected to increase by 1 percentage

18
point of GDP, mainly because of program grants (higher by 0.7 percentage points) from the
European Union (EU) that were expected for 2009. The EU might provide further grant
resources in 2010, but other donor support appears unlikely because multilateral donors have
already exhausted their country allocations.
19.
Priority spending will increase in the 2010 budget. Priorities are implementation of the
peace process, organization of elections, and acceleration of public investment, which should
help alleviate the infrastructure bottlenecks that are crippling growth prospects. 1 The government
is trying to identify additional donor resources to finance not yet covered needs for the peace
process and the elections. 2 It will continue its policy of full payment of government utility
consumption and budgets a real increase in poverty-reducing spending. Staff cautioned that
despite increased resources, the government’s spending program may require difficult trade-offs
considering the tight constraints on external financing in 2010.
20.
Domestic payment arrears and commercial bank debt will be further reduced. The
authorities intend to repay about 2 percent of GDP in domestic arrears (giving priority to salary
arrears and the unpaid bills of small and medium enterprises), which is partially financed by
€8 million from the EU. They have also decided to use part of the SDR allocation, lent through
BEAC, to replace expensive commercial bank financing, make a first mandated repayment of
central bank credit, and partially substitute for the uncertainty of access to the regional bond
market. 3 Using this credit to reduce more expensive sources of financing—commercial bank
interest rates are about 15 percent—rather than increase spending, should improve C.A.R.’s debt
sustainability; and the interest savings could be used for additional social spending. Still, C.A.R.
intends to issue a minimal amount of government paper in 2010 to test its access to the nascent
regional securities market; Fund technical assistance has been requested to advance preparations.
21.
C.A.R.’s debt has become more manageable since HIPC debt relief, but there is still
no room for nonconcessional debt. The country’s moderate risk of debt distress, rooted in its
low revenue and export ratios, implies continued vulnerability to shocks, especially shocks to the
financial system. It is thus essential that nonconcessional debt be avoided. The medium-term
objective remains a domestic primary surplus of about 1 percent of GDP, which should be
consistent with fiscal sustainability (Figure 7). Reflecting mainly debt relief since the completion
point, the public debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to fall from 80 percent in 2008 to 29 percent in
2009, and 25 percent in 2010.

Project grants are reduced compared to program because of a delay in the implementation of the Boali electricity
project, which is now envisioned to be financed on grant resources by the Chinese government.

2

A new military law projects expenditure on the security sectors of about 1 percent of GDP per year, which has no
identified financing. The World Bank will help the government prioritize spending in the context of an upcoming
Public Expenditure Review (PER).

The exact terms of the credit to be extended by the BEAC to member countries are still under discussion.

19
Safeguarding Fund resources
22.
Recent developments have revealed serious governance problems at the regional
central bank (BEAC), raising questions about its ability to safeguard Fund resources. 4 As a
result of weaknesses in BEAC’s governance structure, as well as high-level override of controls,
BEAC suffered significant losses due to fraud in the operations of its Paris office. Staff informed
the authorities that this fraud raised serious questions about BEAC’s ability to safeguard Fund
resources; as a result, staff would need to be satisfied that the authorities were taking appropriate
measures to resolve governance problems in order to recommend the completion of reviews or
approval of new programs for CEMAC members.
23.
The BEAC and CEMAC authorities continue to cooperate closely with Fund staff in
their efforts to resolve the safeguards concerns raised by staff, and have implemented the
initial actions deemed to be essential by Fund staff. The authorities have also committed to
design and implement, in consultation with Fund staff, a comprehensive action plan to address
the safeguard concerns, and to have an independent audit of the implementation of this action
plan and its effectiveness in resolving the problems.
24.
Based on these actions, and the continued determination of the authorities to
effectively resolve the safeguard concerns in cooperation with the Fund, staff is of the view
that the BEAC has shown a sufficient willingness to address safeguards issues to allow
CEMAC country reviews and new programs to be presented to the Board between now
and December 31, 2009. At the same time, if important new information becomes available, or
if the authorities cease their cooperation with the Fund on these issues, this position would need
to be reconsidered.
Structural reforms
25.
Structural reforms are designed to support economic stability and the recovery of
growth. Building on progress already achieved, the authorities agreed with the mission on future
reforms that are intended to enhance revenue mobilization, further strengthen fiscal management
capacity and PFM practices, reform public enterprises, and support private economic activity
through investment sector reform and an improved business climate.
26.
The authorities agreed with the mission that revenue collection is the core of fiscal
reform efforts. Despite recent gains, the domestic revenue ratio is still one of the lowest in subSaharan Africa. The authorities have restructured tax administration, segmenting taxpayers on
the basis of their turnover, but revision of the law to use the current turnover threshold for the
VAT as the sole basis for deciding whether taxpayers are subject to VAT has been postponed to
the 2010 budget law. Publication of a revenue administration reform strategy designed with Fund
4

See Central African Economic and Monetary Community—Staff Report on Common Policies of Member Countries
and the associated supplement for details on the governance problems that emerged at BEAC, the ensuing dialogue
between the authorities and Fund staff, and the measures the authorities have taken and intend to take to investigate
the fraud, strengthen controls, and reform BEAC’s governance.

20
technical assistance is an important component of these efforts (SB, March 2010). The main
elements are enlarging the domestic tax base, enhancing tax efficiency and transparency, and
improving compliance (Table 7). Over the next few years, the authorities expect to increase the
tax-to-GDP ratio by about 0.3 percent annually, and the domestic revenue ratio by about
0.2 percent of GDP. The authorities intend to implement a comprehensive tax policy reform with
technical assistance from the Fund, before the 2012 budget (MEFP ¶26). The new tax audit unit
should expand risk-based tools for detecting fraud and directing audits to the largest revenue
risks; it should also assure more systematic follow-up on identified collection delays.
27.
Timely VAT reimbursement and reduction of customs exemptions will support
competitiveness. VAT reimbursement procedures need to be better monitored to ensure speedy
verification and timely payment, with half the amount paid within 30 days and the rest within
90 days (end-2009 SB). The authorities are making progress in reducing customs exemptions
(end-2009 SB), and they are reviewing current conventions with the view to further limiting
exemptions.
28.
PFM is the second core priority of the authorities’ fiscal reform program. Staff
concurred that PFM reforms are needed to improve the efficiency and transparency of
government financial operations. Gesco is being extended to the payment stage (end-2009 SB),
and in 2010 will be extended further to cover revenues and integrate the resources of spending
agencies. Preparations are also under way to link the debt management system and the simplified
wage management system to Gesco. Eventually the integrated system should enable the
government to have daily information about its fiscal position and serve as a fully integrated
information base for budget implementation.
29.
The liquidity commission should become the linchpin for cash management. The
authorities intend to enhance the role of the committee and move away from managing payments
on an ad hoc basis. The committee will provide written weekly recommendations to the Treasury
committee—chaired by the President—on the basis of rolling resource and expenditure forecasts,
to align expenditure commitments with the resources available (SB, end-March 2010).
30.
The debt database will become the central tool for debt management. The domestic
debt database is being enhanced through detailed recording of all verified domestic arrears in the
computerized debt database (end-2009 SB). It will become a comprehensive database for all
public debt by covering public sector cross-debts (see paragraph 31).
31.
The authorities are determined to reduce public enterprise losses. Further efforts are
needed to fully clarify financial relations and improve service delivery and billing practices
between state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and the government. As part of this effort, the
government will record all SOE debt in its own debt database, inventory cross-debt between
SOEs and local and central governments, and establish a schedule for clearing cross-debts (SB,
end-March 2010). Moreover, as a prior action, the authorities have paid all utility bills issued to
the government from November 2008 through August 2009. They have renewed their
commitment to comply with the QB on paying for government utility consumption within two
months after the receipt of the bill. The SOEs, for their part, will continue to increase their cash
collection-to-billing ratio each quarter, for an annual improvement of 15 percentage points by

21
end-2009 (QB). A reform program for the public utility companies, to be elaborated with World
Bank assistance, should target improvements in their financial, operational, and technical
performance. Notably, the recent commitment by the Chinese government to grant finance
rehabilitation of the electricity generation system should also provide a much-needed impetus for
a fresh look at operational and financial issues for the electricity company, ENERCA.
32.
Strengthening the capital base of the banking system is important for financial
stability. The banking sector is fragile and overly exposed to the government. The planned
reduction in the government’s dependence on commercial bank financing may reduce banks
profitability but should help the banks meet single customer exposure limits; it may also push
them to expand lending to the private sector. Following the regional regulator’s (COBAC)
decision to increase the minimum capital of all banks operating in the CEMAC region to
CFAF 10 billion (1 percent of GDP), the authorities need to decide whether to participate in bank
capital increases (the government holds minority shares in three of the four local commercial
banks). They agreed with staff recommendations to participate in a recapitalization only in
conjunction with a fit and proper major strategic investor and, if required, a COBAC-approved
restructuring strategy. COBAC recently installed a provisional administrator in one of the banks
to work out a timely restructuring plan. A contingency to finance the government’s participation
through a long-term interest bearing bond will be included in the 2010 budget (MEFP ¶28).
While agreeing with the need to strengthen banks’ capital base, the authorities stressed that the
new COBAC capital requirement is high for C.A.R.’s relatively small financial sector and should
be applied with flexibility because banks will have difficulties in meeting it in the short term.
33.
It is essential to improve the investment climate beyond maintaining political and
social stability and to enhance governance and the judiciary system. The new forestry and
mining codes were intended to help attract FDI, but investor response has been mitigated so far
by depressed sectoral prospects. Early assessment of the competitiveness of the tax system under
the new mining code is warranted to address private sector concerns. More generally, firm legal
enforcement practices and a clear and stable regulation are vital to stimulating private investment
and relaunching economic growth. Also, the high trade costs could be lowered by simplifying
customs procedures, improving transportation infrastructure, and streamlining surcharges levied
on top of the common external tariff.
IV. PROGRAM ACCESS, FINANCING, AND MONITORING
34.
The sixth PRGF review will be based on test dates for end-December 2009. The last
review of this PRGF arrangement will take place before June 30, 2010. Quantitative and
structural conditionality are defined in Tables 1 and 2 of the MEFP. The program is fully
financed through the end of the program period in June 2010. The authorities have expressed
their interest in a successor arrangement; preparations for the successor arrangement will begin
at the time of the sixth review mission in March 2010.

22
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
35.
Progress in program implementation and structural reform is steady but slow.
Faced with the challenging realities of a post-conflict situation and scarce financial and human
resources, the authorities are nevertheless making progress toward economic consolidation and
financial stabilization. Macrofiscal policy management has been prudent throughout.
36.
The fiscal stance in 2009 was designed to be moderately countercyclical but
implementation has been delayed. Within the tight constraints of resource availability and
prudent fiscal policy, the program allowed for a moderate fiscal stimulus by maintaining
domestic expenditure programs, including domestic arrears reduction, and initiating donorfinanced DDR expenditure. The authorities are advised to speed up capital spending and to firm
up liquidity management—bunching of project implementation could lead to a tight liquidity
situation by year-end.
37.
Better fiscal management is the main reform priority. Fully integrating the
expenditure management chain and linking it with revenue administration in a well-functioning
computerized system is the real challenge. The Fund is prepared to provide more technical
assistance in these areas, with a view to further strengthening revenue collection and enhancing
the PFM effectiveness and fiscal transparency.
38.
Security reform will present a difficult challenge. Security concerns are a major
impediment to national economic integration and accelerating growth; reform of security
systems should make them more effective and consolidate peace. It is important that cost
implications—and benefits—be analyzed transparently, bearing in mind the difficult expenditure
trade-offs that this may imply, especially for poverty-reducing expenditure.
39.
Enhanced donor involvement is more critical than ever. Given the political
uncertainties, donors’ responses to C.A.R.’s progress in the program have so far been cautious,
and their financial contributions have increased only slowly. The authorities need to better
communicate their successes, intentions, and programs, most notably in the security and political
reform areas. There is also a need to strengthen program implementation by improving donor
coordination and streamlining of procedures.
40.
There is unfinished debt relief business. Achieving the completion point for the
enhanced HIPC initiative and MDRI just five years after conflict ended is a major achievement.
The authorities are now encouraged to forcefully pursue debt relief agreements with all bilateral
and commercial creditors to make HIPC debt reduction fully effective. Negotiations with nonParis Club creditors may be difficult; the authorities are urged to seek treatment of all external
debt on terms comparable to those granted by the Paris Club. C.A.R. is engaged in good faith
efforts to reach collaborative agreements with external private creditors and relations with those
creditors have not undermined program implementation.
41.
Government action is critical to reducing the vulnerability of the banking system.
The establishment of clear relations between the government and commercial banks is welcome;
staff encourages the authorities to accelerate repayment of expensive bank debt. Staff also
recommends that the authorities closely monitor developments in domestic banking and carefully

23
consider how to fulfill their role as shareholder and grantor of banking licenses when faced with
the need to increase bank capital.
42.
The authorities are advised to sustain their reform efforts now that they have
achieved the HIPC completion point. The year ahead will be a particularly difficult for
program implementation; the present PRGF-supported program is coming to an end just as a
heavy political agenda may distract attention from steadfast economic management. Staff
encourages the authorities to diligently persevere in their economic policy stance, consolidate
their achievements, and build on their progress by strengthening program monitoring and
continuing to pursue prudent economic and financial policies.
43.
Sustained economic growth critically hinges on private investment. Much work
remains to be done to improve the investment climate, which is perceived as one of the least
attractive in the world. Mending infrastructure weaknesses through public investment is key. The
financial and technical rehabilitation of public utility companies, including the rapid installation
of additional electricity generation, should help address a major concern for productivity growth
and social development. Streamlining the tax system and reducing informal business practices,
including the pervasive use of cash, should also be beneficial.
44.
Staff supports completion of the review and the waiver for the PC on commercial
bank credit based on the corrective action taken. Staff supports the authorities’ request to
modify end-December performance criteria to reflect better fiscal performance and less external
financing. The authorities’ intention to use the provision of special credit by the BEAC,
introduced on the back of the SDR allocation, to pay off more expensive domestic debt is costeffective and in line with program objectives. The authorities’ interest in a successor Fundsupported program is welcome.

Mr. Dominique Strauss-Kahn
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, DC, 20431
USA
Mr. Strauss-Kahn:
1.
The government of the Central African Republic has successfully implemented the
measures contained in the economic and financial program with the support of the
International Monetary Fund through its Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF).
2.
The attached memorandum of economic and financial policies (MEFP) supplements
previous memoranda attached to the letters dated November 30, 2006, September 7, 2007,
June 3, 2008, December 4, 2008, and June 5, 2009. The last sets out quantitative performance
criteria for end-June 2009 for completion of the fifth review (sixth disbursement) of the
PRGF arrangement.
3.
All quantitative performance criteria for completion of the fifth review under the
PRGF arrangement were observed except for the government credit from commercial banks.
On the basis of our overall performance and on the strength of the policies set forth in the
attached memorandum, we request a waiver on the performance criterion related to
commercial bank credit based on the corrective action taken, and completion of the fifth
PRGF review. We request disbursement of the sixth loan in the amount of
SDR 11.455 million (20.6 percent of quota).
4.
The government believes that the policies set forth in the attached MEFP will enable
it to meet its program objectives, but is ready to take any other measures that might be
necessary. The Central African Republic will, in accordance with Fund policy, consult with
the Fund on the adoption of any measures that may be appropriate and before revising the
policies set out in the attached MEFP. The sixth and last review (seventh disbursement) of
the PRGF arrangement is expected to be completed no later than the end of June 2010.

32
5.
The government intends to explore the possibility of a successor arrangement,
possibly starting in July 2010.
6.
The government intends to make the contents of this letter, the attached MEFP, the
Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU), and the related staff report available to
the public. Therefore, it authorizes the IMF to post these documents on its web site once the
Executive Board has concluded the review.
7.
We fully recognize that the Fund is appropriately concerned about safeguarding its
resources and, in this regard, understand that it would not be in a position to complete this
review unless related concerns are being addressed satisfactorily. To this end, we emphasize
that the Central African authorities will work closely with the BEAC and fellow BEAC
member countries to ensure the timely implementation of the remedial measures discussed
with Fund staff as necessary to demonstrate satisfactory progress in resolving safeguards
concerns at the BEAC. The BEAC has implemented the agreed initial actions; BEAC
authorities are in close contact with Fund staff to discuss further measures designed to
safeguard Fund and BEAC resources.
8.
The government implemented one prior action before Executive Board consideration
of our request for completion of the fifth review of the PRGF arrangement, namely the full
payment of all government utility bills from ENERCA, SODECA, and SOCATEL received
from the beginning of November 2008 through end-August 2009.

ATTACHMENT I
TRANSLATED FROM FRENCH
C ENTRAL AFRICAN R EPUBLIC
M EMORANDUM OF E CONOMIC AND F INANCIAL P OLICIES, 2009–10
Bangui, November 18, 2009
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Economic conditions have improved noticeably since the government of the Central
African Republic (C.A.R.) began implementing its medium-term macroeconomic and
financial program in late 2006 with Fund support. Political and social stability has been
strengthened as a result of the Inclusive Political Dialogue (IPD) held in December 2008.
New expenditures related to the Demobilization, Disarmament and Reintegration (DDR)
program have been initiated and should contribute to national reconciliation ahead of the
general elections to be held in early 2010.
2.
The approval by the Boards of Executive Directors of the Fund and World Bank of
the completion point for the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative in
June 2009 has significantly improved debt sustainability. The total debt relief under the HIPC
Initiative and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) amounted to around
CFAF 560 billion in nominal terms (59 percent of GDP), a large part of which was provided
upon reaching the completion point, allowing a reduction of our external debt to about
CFAF 90 billion by the end of 2009. We are very grateful to the international community,
including the IMF, for granting this debt relief, which allows us to make additional spending
aiming at poverty reduction.
3.
The global economic slowdown has seriously affected our economy. Our major
exports dropped significantly, leading to the lowest economic growth since 2005 and
shortfalls on government revenues. With support from the international community, we have
stepped up our efforts to pursue strong policies and program implementation to stabilize our
economy and create the basis for sustainable economic growth.
4.
This memorandum presents the government’s economic and financial policies until
June 30, 2010. The measures and objectives of the program are consistent with the Poverty
Reduction and Strategy Paper (PRSP) adopted on June 30, 2007, and the first annual report
of the implementation of the PRSP adopted in early 2009, respectively, both after extensive
consultations with major stakeholders. We are aware of our shortcomings toward reaching
the Millennium Development Goals, which are compounded by the fact that financing is
insufficient to meet our needs and that foreign aid has gone mainly to humanitarian
assistance.

34
II. RECENT ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE AND POLICIES
A. Macroeconomic Performance and Program Implementation
5.
Economic growth slowed further with GDP growing at an expected rate of only
2.0 percent in 2009, after 2.2 percent in 2008. The most important contribution to economic
growth is expected from agriculture, which accounts for almost a third of GDP, whereas our
export sectors are continuing to perform poorly under current world market conditions.
Average inflation has fallen to 7.1 percent in September after reaching 9.3 percent in 2008
mainly thanks to food prices that decelerated, thus also providing welcome social relief to
consumers. Year-on-year inflation in September declined to 1.7 percent, which provides
evidence that inflation should decline to 4 percent on average in 2009.
6.
Our two main export commodities were affected by a collapse in external demand:
wood products and diamond exports dropped by 38 percent and 27 percent, respectively, in
volume terms in the 12 months to July 2009. Sustained domestic economic activity in the
primary sector, especially subsistence and animal farming, compensated somewhat for the
negative external shocks thanks to the international community’s support to this sector and
improved security in the production areas. Credit to the private sector declined by 7 percent
in June, in part reflecting weak activity in the forestry sector and the unwinding of stock
building by oil importing companies. The banking system has not been directly affected by
the global financial crisis, and the liquidity position of commercial banks appears intact.
However, second round effects on major economic operators and repercussions on our banks
cannot entirely be ruled out.
7.
Macro-fiscal performance in the first half of 2009 was in line with the program. We
met the performance criteria (PC) on total domestic revenue. Revenue from profits and
property taxes was substantially higher than expected, whereas tax revenue on goods and
services, including international trade taxes, was slightly below target, reflecting the effects
of the economic crisis. We are well under way toward reaching our revenue target for the
year, despite the adverse economic environment. We exceeded our target for the reduction of
tax arrears by CFAF 0.8 billion, and we were able to clean up the stock of tax arrears, which
included many claims that can no longer be recovered.
8.
Thanks to our tight control on expenditures we met the PC on the domestic primary
balance at end-June. We are aware that this result has also been achieved due to lower-thanprogrammed domestically-financed capital expenditure. However, we managed to increase
spending in priority areas, notably health and education, and reached the related quantitative
benchmark. There was a deviation on the PC on net claims of the commercial banking
system on the government due to a miscommunication between the treasury and the central
bank which led to a delayed transfer of funds from the treasury account to the commercial
banks. As a corrective action, the liquidity commission has started providing weekly written
recommendations to the treasury committee on the actions required to adhere to the PC on
net commercial bank credit (in anticipation of the more comprehensive related structural
benchmark for end-March 2010). Due to a technical problem related to the implementation of

35
Gesco, we are not yet in a position to calculate the stock of domestic expenditure arrears
(measured as expenditures approved for payment that have not been paid for 60 days). Thus,
we used the previous definition for this objective according to which expenditure arrears
declined by CFAF 3.4 billion in the first semester of 2009, in line with the relevant
quantitative benchmark.
B. Progress in Structural Reforms
9.
The government has implemented important structural reform measures. The
quarterly petroleum product pricing mechanism adopted on June 1, 2008, has contributed to
strong revenue from the petroleum sector in the first half of 2009, ensuring pass-through to
consumers of all costs, distribution margins, and taxes, including VAT at the regular rate.
Moreover, we have created a difference in the margin for importation of petroleum products
by river versus by road of CFAF 20 per liter to provide a greater incentive to import by river,
which is much less costly for the budget and less environmentally risky. We applied the
formula in January and in April 2009, and all subsidies but the one on kerosene transported
by road were eliminated. In July 2009, we anticipated that not changing the existing price
structure would not result in revenue losses. Calculations based on the methodology specified
in the Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU) made subsequently for July 2009
revealed a small loss of fiscal revenue in the order of CFAF 36 million (0.004 percent of
GDP). We recognize the importance of the principle of passing-through to consumers world
oil price changes regularly and safeguarding our domestic tax revenues from petroleum
products. In this spirit, in October 2009 we adjusted domestic fuel prices on kerosene by
CFAF 50 per liter (thus eliminating any subsidy element on this product) and the price of fuel
oil by CFAF 24 per liter. This resulted in an average increase of 1.3 percent. Moreover, we
unified the price for kerosene, but we were not in a position to increase the price of gasoline
as required by the formula, but the revenue loss for the month again was only
CFAF 86 million (0.009 percent of GDP). Moreover, with the current excise structure we
will be able to meet the annual target for petroleum revenues under the program. Considering
that a criterion for meeting the structural benchmark on adjusting domestic fuel prices hinges
on no net reduction of fiscal revenues, we believe that we have met the spirit of the relevant
structural benchmark.
10.
More progress has been made in revenue administration reform. We intend to meet
the end-December 2009 structural benchmark related to improving the payment of VAT
refund requests for reliable taxpayers. In this regard, the special VAT account with BEAC is
being used exclusively for VAT refunds. We have nominated a director of the audit
department and related personnel in June 2009 and the audit plan for 2010 will be adopted
before end-2009. In the first semester of 2009, we audited 30 percent of large taxpayers and,
with a delay of not more than 30 days, all stop-filers and all VAT declarations with a credit
or zero balance. This has allowed us to achieve a non-filer rate of 5 percent, and we intend to
maintain this rate for all of 2009. We interconnected the tax and customs administrations’
information systems (SYSTEMIF and ASYCUDA++), thus observing the related structural
benchmark. Furthermore, we have stepped up the training of staff and established a working

36
group to define mutual data exchange needs to use these systems widely and effectively. In
order to increase effectiveness of our customs controls and operations, we have abolished the
state agency CEMIFI and limited the activities of the private company SODIF to ex-post
controls to avoid the duplication of collection and enforcement work. Changes to the VAT
(Article 247 of the tax code) to make turnover the only criterion for whether taxpayers are
subject to the VAT will be considered in the context of the 2010 budget law, as modifications
in the context of the revised 2009 budget law were likely to be disruptive for taxpayers. In
line with IMF TA recommendations, tax administration has been restructured through a
revised segmentation of the Large Taxpayer Unit (LTU), the Medium Taxpayer Unit (MTU),
and the Small Taxpayer Unit (STU).
11.
In the area of public financial management (PFM), we are making important progress
in the computerization of the expenditure chain with the extension of the Gesco system based
on the new budget classification adopted in 2008. Firm instructions to limit the authority to
sign conventions that financially commit the government were issued. We submitted to
parliament the legal amendments to revise the 1988 law and decree on government
guarantees and strengthen our legal framework for issuing such guarantees together with the
revised 2009 budget law (end-September 2009 structural benchmark). However, parliament
decided to amend the relevant legislation together with the 2010 budget and we will resubmit
this legislation in this context. We have clarified our financial relations with commercial
banks by signing new conventions between the government and each domestic commercial
banks. These conventions consolidate past loans into one new loan with a lower interest rate,
a grace period of 6 months, and 3-year to 3½-year maturities. All government receipts are
deposited in the main treasury account at the central bank (BEAC) (end-June 2009 structural
benchmark).
III. THE PROGRAM FOR 2009 AND 2010
12.
Despite sustained growth in agricultural production, real GDP growth in 2009 is
expected at 2 percent due to several negative shocks to the economy. Lower demand and
good harvests are expected to reduce price pressures and result in a year-on-year inflation of
minus 0.8 percent at end-2009. However, because of price increases in late 2008, average
inflation in 2009 is expected to be higher at 3.7 percent. The trade sector remains under the
effect of the external shocks. Total exports of goods are projected to fall by CFAF 12 billion
to CFAF 52 billion in 2009, slightly below program. Imports remain compressed and are
projected to fall by 5 percent in volume terms, which is CFAF 6 billion lower than
programmed. The current account deficit is projected to fall to around 9 percent of GDP,
1 percentage point lower than in 2008 result mainly due to overall favorable developments in
world oil prices, recovery of diamonds prices, and higher aid inflows. With significant
additional inflows from donors toward the end of the year and the Special Drawing Rights
(SDR) allocation from the Fund, the overall balance of payments is expected to improve as
official foreign reserves are expected to rise to 5 months of import cover in 2009 from
3.3 months in 2008.

37
13.
Our priorities for the remainder of 2009 and 2010 are to stabilize the economy and
prepare the basis for reverting to a path of economic growth by consolidating our export
sectors while preserving a prudent fiscal stance. Specifically, we will continue (i) improving
our domestic revenue collection; (ii) consolidating domestic demand by maintaining
budgeted expenditures, paying domestic arrears, and accelerating the implementation of
expenditure programs related to the DDR process; (iii) paying all current government
obligations and improving its financial standing; and (iv) maintaining the momentum in
public financial management reforms. Moreover, we are working toward safeguarding the
stability of our banking system.
A. Fiscal Policy for the Remainder of 2009
14.
Domestic revenue in 2009 is projected to rise by 0.1 percentage points to 10.5 percent
of GDP on the basis of the encouraging results of the first half of the year. In particular, the
reforms of the petroleum sector taxation, VAT collection procedures, and more effective
revenue administration are having positive effects. Nontax revenue will fall by 0.3 percent of
GDP, mainly because one-off receipts in 2008 related to the sale of telecommunication
licenses will not be repeated. The revised budget reflects the revenue projections in line with
the updated program projections.
15.
The revised budget, adopted in September, includes some additional expenditure for
the peace process. We have decided to shift a substantial part of spending on the DDR to
2010, partly because of bottlenecks in implementation capacity. In 2009, we have allocated
CFAF 2 billion for such spending, significantly less than our initial projection of
CFAF 10 billion (1.1 percent of GDP); we are also spending the planned CFAF 1 billion to
prepare for the 2010 elections, as expected in the program. We have allocated
CFAF 56 million to repair damage caused by exceptional flooding of extended
neighborhoods in Bangui in July. In addition, we received donor assistance outside the
budget in relation to this natural catastrophe, and we are grateful for this spontaneous
expression of international solidarity. We intend to put in place an effective program to
reduce the impact of recurrent floods in Bangui. Given the delays incurred in capital budget
execution, we are making every effort to avoid undue strains on our treasury at the end of the
year.
16.
In response to these recent developments, the domestic primary balance is
substantially improved compared to program with a deficit of 0.4 percent of GDP. The
available financing would allow for further repayment of arrears (1.4 percent of GDP) and
reduction of the most onerous credits from commercial banks. Public debt should decline
from 80 percent of GDP in 2008 to about 29 percent of GDP in 2009, mostly related to HIPC
completion point debt relief. We will negotiate agreement on final debt relief with our
bilateral creditors and will ensure comparable treatment for the debt renegotiations.

38
B. Macroeconomic Objectives for 2010
17.
Growth is expected to revert to a more expansionary path in 2010, as the effects of
the global economic crisis ebb and the electricity infrastructure is rehabilitated. Improved
growth prospects at 3½ percent and lower inflation around 2.2 percent will be important to
support the peace process and maintain political stability in the run-up to the 2010 elections.
The current account deficit is expected to decline to around 7½ percent of GDP on account of
higher aid inflows, and with moderate private sector inflows, the overall balance of payments
will record a significant deficit and we expect to loose a limited amount of reserves in the
absence of additional external support.
18.
Fiscal policy will continue to support demand while raising our low tax revenue ratio.
We intend to increase our tax revenue ratio by 0.3 percent of GDP through improved revenue
administration; however, due to nonrecurring nontax revenue items the total revenue ratio is
expected to remain unchanged at 10.5 percent of GDP. On the expenditure side, we will
continue to unfreeze civil servant salaries and eliminate fuel subsidies. The overall level of
primary current expenditures will rise by 0.9 percentage point of GDP, mainly due to a carry
over of DDR expenditure from the previous year. We will continue to allocate more to health
and education and less to wasteful subsidies. Social expenditures are expected to increase by
at least 5 percent in real terms; domestically financed capital expenditures would be
unchanged. The 2010 budget will include an allocation of CFAF 6 billion for the DDR,
which will be disbursed in consultation with the DDR Monitoring Committee, as well as
spending for the elections. The latter include contributions from the UN and the European
Union (€4 million).
19.
We intend to further improve the efficiency of our spending and have asked the
World Bank to undertake a Public Expenditure Review, which is expected for early 2010. In
this context, the government also intends to review defense expenditure with a view to
improving the efficiency of this spending while safeguarding security. We expect to receive
additional budget support from the European Union of CFAF 5 billion, which we will use to
make additional repayments of social arrears (salary arrears, pensions, and scholarships) so
as to increase the arrears clearance target to CFAF 20 billion in 2010.
20.
As a result of shifting expenditure for the DDR from 2009 to 2010, the domestic
primary deficit will rise by 0.8 percentage points to 1.2 percent of GDP in 2010. Budgetsupport grants are projected to increase by 0.7 percentage points to 1.9 percent of GDP,
which will help to reduce arrears and finance poverty reducing spending. We intend to use
part of the SDR 44 million (CFAF 30 billion) allocation received from the Fund to reduce
expensive domestic bank debt and to reduce reliance on expensive market financing. This
would provide us with further valuable savings on debt service that we intend to spend on our
social programs. Total public sector debt would decline from 29 percent of GDP in 2009 to
25 percent of GDP in 2010.

39
C. Structural Reforms
21.
The government will coordinate with the donors operating in C.A.R. to harmonize the
structural reform program. We expect that the General Framework for Budget Support to the
PRSP (CGAB-DSRP) agreed in October will improve the predictability of aid and facilitate
administration of donor support. The donors participating in this process are the African
Development Bank, the European Union, France, and the World Bank, with the Fund
participating as an observer. The strategic goal of the harmonized program is to agree on a
streamlined and better focused reform agenda and support it by technical assistance. We will
work with the above donors on common programs for rapid adoption and implementation.
Under this framework, we are preparing a reform program for public finances, with the
financial support of the European Union.
Revenue administration reforms and tax policy
22.
We continue to make the tax system work better. We have started levying VAT on all
petroleum products in January 2009, and we will continue to increase excises on kerosene by
some CFAF 40 per liter every quarter until we completely eliminate any residual subsidies
and essentially equalize its excise with that of diesel, which is a close substitute for and often
mixed with kerosene in transportation. As a result, the gross increase in petroleum-related
resources for the government budget in 2009, including VAT, is projected at
CFAF 13 billion. To facilitate the implementation of the quarterly petroleum product price
adjustment mechanism, the price structure committee, which includes Ministry of Mining
and Energy, Ministry of Finance and Budget, and the oil agency (A.S.R.P.), will provide
price recommendations to the cabinet in line with the mechanism at the latest 5 calendar days
before the end of a quarter. Finally, we will review the competitiveness of mining sector
taxation with external assistance.
23.
The emphasis of tax administration is audit selection, taxpayer registration, and VAT
refund processing. We will continue to perform issue-oriented audits for nonfilers or VAT
tax declarations with a negative VAT liability. Moreover, we intend to develop risk-based
indicators to select large taxpayers for audit and those large taxpayers whose declarations are
inconsistent with their import records. Moreover, we will incorporate large and medium
taxpayers identified during the recent taxpayer census. We will step up security in granting
the tax identification number (TIN) to ensure that each taxpayer is uniquely identified by this
TIN. We will continue to pay VAT refund requests on a timely basis after verification
(December 2009 structural benchmark). Moreover, we will require that all transactions
between the government and large and medium taxpayers be made by bank transfer.
24.
We intend to reinforce our policy and administrative efforts in the area of customs
administration. Making good use of the ASYCUDA system and its connection with
SYSTEMIF will help improve customs administration, and we intend to expand its use and
capabilities forcefully in cooperation with our technical assistance partners. In addition, we
will further increase the efficiency of customs administration by providing adequate

40
resources by making sure the customs fee for computerization is fully available for the use of
the customs IT system. In this context, we will transfer the capacity for the development of
ASYCUDA to customs, and we will extend ASYCUDA to our main offices and the external
inspection company BIVAC. We will also step up efforts to train personnel in various
priority areas, and ensure that the customs service has operational independence and
independence in human resource management. We will work toward facilitating transit
procedures between the Douala port and the final destination. In this context, we request a
technical assistance mission to assess the effectiveness of our bureau in Douala. We are
striving to better control fraud on transit and re-exports by introducing appropriate
administrative controls to ensure that exports are effectively consumed abroad. The customs
and tax departments will undertake detailed assessments of the operational effectiveness and
financial performance of the private company SODIF on a quarterly basis. This will provide
the basis for determining in the second quarter of 2010 how the government’s relationship
with the company should be defined.
25.
Customs exemptions will be reduced further by reviewing existing conventions with a
view to eliminating discretionary exemptions altogether and to limiting statutory exemptions
only to those with a clear economic rationale. Thus, we expect to reduce the total amount of
exemptions from CFAF 11 billion in 2008 to CFAF 9 billion in 2009 (structural benchmark
end-December 2009). Moreover, we will study eliminating customs exemptions for the
government. The idea would be to increase the budgetary allocations of the respective
ministries to pay for the duties in the hope that this would simplify the work of the customs
administration and reduce abuse of exemption privileges.
26.
We have received technical assistance from the IMF’s Fiscal Affairs Department in
May 2009, which proceeded to a comprehensive review of our tax administration and made
recommendations for operational and institutional reforms. We will prepare and publish a
detailed reform strategy for revenue administration, based on the Fund’s diagnosis by endMarch 2010 (structural benchmark), and we have requested follow-up technical assistance
from FAD and AFRITAC for this purpose. In the area of tax documentation, we have
compiled the relevant legislation into a single tax code, which is updated, and will be
published on the internet together with the relevant regulations issued by the tax
administration. We hope to receive technical assistance from the Fund for a comprehensive
tax policy reform in early 2010 so as to implement the new tax code with the 2012 budget.
The objective of the reform would be to further reduce exemptions and nuisance taxes,
streamlining tax payment procedures, and shifting from trade taxes to domestic consumption
and income taxation, with a view to enhancing revenue and administrative efficiency, and
improving the investment climate. Already in preparation for this reform, we requested
technical assistance from the European Union.
Public financial and debt management reforms
27.
The government’s priorities for public financial management reforms continue to be
to (i) strengthen liquidity management; (ii) improve expenditure tracking and budget

41
monitoring; (iii) enhance debt management; and (iv) increase fiscal transparency. To this
end, we intend to take the following steps:
•

We will strengthen the work of the liquidity commission. The commission will
prepare rolling budget projections of expenditure commitments, revenues, and debt
service requirements for the forthcoming week, month, quarter, and remainder of the
year. To improve the work of the commission, we will conduct a review of the
commission and make recommendations to enhance its role. Specifically, at the latest
starting in January 2010, we will require weekly written recommendations on
adjusting expenditure commitments in line with the rolling forecasts. These
recommendations will be presented in a timely manner to the treasury committee,
which is in charge of strategic policy decisions related to budget implementation
(structural benchmark, end-March 2010).

•

We are reestablishing the treasury single account (TSA). We have reduced treasury
accounts at commercial banks to one per bank (with exception of two transfer
accounts and donor-mandated accounts required for project management), which is
the minimum required to maintain transactions through banks, namely wage
payments. We are confident that the TSA will be operational by end-December 2009
(structural benchmark). We have received technical assistance from the Fund to
operate the remaining treasury commercial bank accounts on a zero-balance basis.
The monthly reconciliation of government accounts between the treasury and the
central bank already ensures that data regarding the net treasury position are
consistent. We will work to extend payments by bank transfers to pensioners and
regular suppliers.

•

We are making important progress in the computerization of the expenditure chain,
and we have now secured financing from the World Bank for the extension of the
Gesco system, the compilation of the final accounts for 2008 and the corresponding
budget execution law. With respect to Gesco, the World Bank is financing its
finalization and its integration with other information management systems. We
expect to fully integrate all stages of the expenditure process into the Gesco system
(end-December 2009 structural benchmark). This will require implementing a
feedback mechanism between the budget department and treasury computer systems
to link payments to the corresponding budget categories so as to allow detailed and
comprehensive reports on budget execution. In addition, Gesco will include all
expenditures without prior commitment or payment orders (for example those for
debt service, salaries, travel advances, utility bills, and government petroleum product
consumption), budget agencies’ expenditures financed by own resources, and other
payments not following the standard expenditure procedures. We will measure delays
in processing expenditure at all stages after commitment. A further extension of
Gesco, which will include the recording of transactions by the revenue agencies, is
planned for mid-2010. We will further link to Gesco the debt management system
(SYGADE) and the simplified system for wage management.

•

We continue to work on recording all verified domestic arrears from previous years in
the computerized debt database of the debt department on an arrear by arrear basis
(structural benchmark, end-December 2009). We will also create an inventory of

42
public sector cross debt, establish a schedule for the clearance of cross debt between
State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) and local and central governments (end-March 2010
structural benchmark). As part of the benchmark, all the debts of SOEs will be
recorded in the government debt database to have readily accessible information on
total public sector debt. The actions under the benchmark are an essential step to put
financial relations within the public sector on a transparent and sound basis.
•

Effective implementation of our financial strategy including arrears clearance will
require issuance of government securities in the nascent regional market. In 2010, we
expect to place only a limited amount to test the market. In the meantime, we will
accelerate our preparations for market access and improve the credibility of our
financial management. We expect to receive Fund technical assistance in this process
in late 2009/early 2010.

•

We have started publishing quarterly budget execution reports to increase
transparency and better communicate government fiscal policies. In addition, we have
published the revised 2009 budget and intend to publish the 2010 budget after its
adoption by parliament.

•

We intend to complete the preparation of the 2008 budget execution law before end2009, and to start applying the new chart of accounts from the beginning of 2010 by
(i) customizing the Gesco system, and (ii) conducting a series of tests before the final
transfer into Gesco.

Banking system, public utilities, and municipalities
28.
There is a need to improve the prudential ratios of local commercial banks. Following
COBAC’s decision to set the minimum capital requirements of commercial banks at
CFAF 10 billion, the four local commercial banks have to raise their capital. The government
has minority participations in three of the four commercial banks. Our preferred approach is
not to participate in the capital increase, but should there be a need to participate we would
do so only if there is at least one fit and proper major strategic investor envisioned for the
bank and, if required, a restructuring strategy approved by COBAC is in place. If necessary,
the government would recapitalize by issuing a long-term interest bearing government bond,
and this contingency will be reflected in the 2010 budget. It is expected, that the
government’s contribution to the recapitalization would be less than CFAF 4 billion
(0.4 percent of GDP). Moreover, the government’s strategy to reduce borrowing from
commercial banks will help them meet the regulation on exposure to a single customer,
which some banks had not respected due to their government loans.
29.
We will continue to improve the financial performance of the public utility
companies. The combined collection ratio (cash collections divided by amount billed) for the
three major utility companies (electricity, water, and telecommunications) was 73 percent in
the quarter ending in June, up from 67 percent at end-2008, thus narrowly missing the
relevant quantitative benchmark, mainly because of the nonpayment of government utility
bills during that period. We continue to target a gradual increase of 15 percentage points
during 2009 (quantitative benchmark). Full payment of current utility bills by the

43
government is an essential element of our strategy to improve the financial and overall
performance of utility companies and will help achieve this improvement (quantitative
benchmark). To this end, as a prior action, we have paid all utility bills that were submitted to
the government from November 2008 through end-August 2009 in the amount of
CFAF 1.2 billion. The improvement of the financial situation of the public utility companies
will enable them to repay their tax arrears. The precise repayment of these tax arrears will be
determined in the context of the public sector cross debts clearance schedule.
30.
Securitizing and increasing electricity supply is essential for growth. For ENERCA’s
generating plant in Boali, our main hydro-generation facility, we are benefiting from
technical and financial support from the World Bank (US$10 million) and the French
Development Agency (€4.2 million) for rehabilitation of the system and maintenance of the
currently installed capacity of 18 megawatts of electricity. We have signed an agreement
with the Chinese authorities to rebuild our electricity generating capacity including, in the
short run, the supply of two turbines for Boali III, which would increase electricity
production by 10 megawatts. This would solve the short-term supply problems and produce
large economic benefits since electricity is currently only provided about 16 hours per day,
interrupted by rolling black-outs. This project will be financed by grants and should start its
implementation in 2010.
31.
We also envisage normalizing our financial relations with the municipality of Bangui.
The central government will clear its debt to the municipality by paying ENERCA directly
for municipality arrears. We will continue to fully transfer any shared revenues and disburse
the regular transfers to the municipality of Bangui. We intend to clarify the assignment of the
responsibility for paying the public lighting in Bangui based on the results of a study
expected for early 2010.
D. Program Monitoring
32.
The program will be monitored through biannual reviews of quantitative performance
criteria (PCs) for end-December 2009 (Table I.1), and structural benchmarks for 2009/10
(Table I.2). Detailed definitions and reporting requirements for all quantitative PCs and
structural conditions are contained in the accompanying Technical Memorandum of
Understanding (TMU, Attachment II). The government will make available to Fund staff all
core data, appropriately reconciled, on a regular and timely basis, as specified in the TMU.

APPENDIX I

ATTACHMENT II
TRANSLATED FROM FRENCH
CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
Bangui, November 18, 2009
1.
This Technical Memorandum of Understanding describes the definitions that are
intended to clarify the measurement of the quantitative performance criteria and indicators in
Table 1 of the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies, November 2009, attached
to the authorities’ Letter of Intent. It also specifies the periodicity and deadlines for
transmission of data to the staff of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for program
monitoring purposes. Unless otherwise specified, all 2009 quantitative performance criteria
and indicative targets will be evaluated in terms of cumulative flows from
December 31, 2008.
A. Provision of Data to the Fund
2.
Data with respect to all variables subject to performance criteria and indicative targets
will be provided to Fund staff on a regular basis—with the data and timing indicated in
Table 1—including any revisions, which will be transmitted in a timely manner. In addition,
the authorities will consult with IMF staff on any information and data that become available
that are relevant for assessing or monitoring performance against the program’s objectives
but are not specifically defined in this memorandum.
B. Definitions
3.
Unless otherwise indicated, the government is defined as the central government of
the Central African Republic (C.A.R.) and does not include local governments, the central
bank, or any public entity with autonomous legal personality (i.e., wholly or partially owned
state enterprises) not currently covered by the consolidated government financial operations
table (Tableau des opérations financières de l’État—TOFE).
4.
Government expenditure on a commitment (engagement) basis (except for interest
payments, which are on a due basis) includes all earmarked spending, treasury operations, the
domestic counterparts to foreign-financed projects, and offsetting operations. Poverty-related
spending on health and education will be reported from the functional classification of
government expenditure. Starting in 2009, detailed government expenditure in the TOFE will
be reported on a commitment (engagement) basis, and this information will be
complemented not later than January 2010 by the change in the aggregate stock of
expenditures committed without payment order (dépenses engagées non-ordonnancées) and

47
the change in the aggregate stock of expenditures with payment orders not paid (dépenses
ordonnancées non-payées), which would be divided into those younger than 60 days and
those older than 60 days.
5.
For the purposes of this memorandum, the definitions of “debt” and “concessional
borrowing” are as follows:
•

The term “debt” has the meaning set forth in point No. 9 of the Guidelines on
Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt (Executive Board Decision
No. 12274–00/85, August 24, 2000) but also to commitments contracted or
guaranteed for which value has not been received. For purposes of these guidelines,
the term “debt” is understood to mean a current, that is, not contingent, liability,
created under a contractual arrangement through the provision of value in the form of
assets (including currency) or services, and which requires the obligor to make one or
more payments in the form of assets (including currency) or services, at some future
point(s) in time; these payments will discharge the principal and/or interest liabilities
incurred under the contract. Debts can take a number of forms, the primary ones
being as follows (i) loans, that is, advances of money to the obligor by the lender
made on the basis of an undertaking that the obligor will repay the funds in the future
(including deposits, bonds, debentures, commercial loans, and buyers’ credits) and
temporary exchanges of assets that are equivalent to fully collateralized loans, under
which the obligor is required to repay the funds, and usually pay interest, by
repurchasing the collateral from the buyer in the future (such as repurchase
agreements and official swap arrangements); (ii) suppliers’ credits, that is, contracts
where the supplier permits the obligor to defer payments until some time after the
date on which the goods are delivered or services are provided; and (iii) leases, that
is, arrangements under which property is provided that the lessee has the right to use
for one or more specified periods of time that are usually shorter than the total
expected service life of the property, while the lessor retains the title to the property.
For the purpose of the guideline, the debt is the present value (at the inception of the
lease) of all lease payments expected to be made during the period of the agreement,
excluding those payments that cover the operation, repair, or maintenance of the
property. Under the definition of debt set out above, arrears, penalties, and judicially
awarded damages arising from the failure to make payment under a contractual
obligation that constitutes debt are debt. Failure to make payment on an obligation
that is not considered debt under this definition (e.g., payment on delivery) will not
give rise to debt.
C. Quantitative Performance Criteria

Government domestic revenue (floor)
6.
Government domestic revenue is as reported in the TOFE, and it includes offsetting
operations in revenue and current-period expenditure—between the government and all
suppliers of goods and services—excluding foreign grants and divestiture receipts.
Government revenue includes all tax and nontax revenue, as well as earmarked revenue,

48
checks for project-related customs duties, and withholdings from civil service wages and
salaries actually paid.
Domestic primary fiscal balance (floor)
7.
The domestic primary fiscal balance, on a cash basis, is defined as the difference
between government domestic revenue and government expenditure, excluding all
interest payments and externally financed capital expenditure. Starting in 2009, the domestic
primary balance will be measured on a commitment basis (base engagement). The domestic
primary fiscal balance will be calculated from above the line with the data provided in the
TOFE.
Adjuster
8.
The floor on the domestic primary fiscal balance will be adjusted downward for any
excess in foreign budget support grants relative to program projections.
Change of net claims of the commercial banking system on the government (ceiling)
9.
The end-of-period stock of net claims of the commercial banking system on the
government (net of purchases of government securities) is defined as the difference
between deposits held by the government in commercial banks and outstanding loans and
overdrafts as reported in the monetary survey minus commercial bank purchases of
government securities.
Adjuster
10.
The ceiling on the change of net claims of the commercial banking system on the
government (net of purchases of government securities) will be:
i.

increased by 100 percent of any cumulative shortfalls in external budget
support grants compared to program projections up to the limit specified in
Table 1 of the MEFP;

ii.

decreased by 57 percent of regional bond issuances;

iii.

decreased (increased) by 100 percent of any cumulative excess (shortfall)
compared to program projections in external financing (without project loan
disbursements); and

iv.

decreased (increased) by 100 percent of any cumulative shortfall (excess)
repayments of debt to domestic petroleum companies and/or CEMAC-based
commercial banks (for borrowing before December 31, 2008).

Nonconcessional external debt or guarantees (ceiling, continuous)
11.
The performance criterion on the contracting of new nonconcessional external debt
applies to both short- (original maturity of one year or less) and medium- and long-term
(original maturity of more than one year) external debt contracted or guaranteed by the
government. Purchases from the IMF are excluded from this limit.

49
12.
Loan concessionality is assessed on the basis of the commercial interest reference
rates (CIRRs) established by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD). A loan is said to be on concessional terms if, on the date the contract is signed, the
ratio of the present value of the loan, calculated on the basis of the reference interest rates, to
its nominal value is less than 65 percent (that is, a grant element of at least 35 percent, which
does not apply to refinancing operations). For debts with a maturity exceeding 15 years, the
10-year CIRR published by the OECD is used to calculate the grant element. For shorter
maturities, the 6-month market reference rate is used. To both the 10-year and 6-month
averages of the reference rate, the following margins will be added 0.75 percent for
repayment periods of less than 15 years; 1 percent for 15–19 years; 1.15 percent for
20–29 years; and 1.25 percent for 30 years or more.
13.
The concept of government for the purpose of the indicator on external debt includes
government as defined in paragraph 3, administrative public institutions, public enterprises
authorized to contract, guarantee, or accommodate nonconcessional borrowing, scientific and
technical public institutions, professional public institutions, industrial and commercial
public institutions, and local governments.
External payment arrears (ceiling, continuous)
14.
External payment arrears are deemed to accrue when undisputed interest or
amortization payments of the government are not made within the terms of the contract or in
conformity with any future deferral agreed with the Paris Club or other bilateral and
commercial creditors.
D. Structural Benchmarks
Automatic petroleum product pricing formula (continuous structural benchmark)
15.
The automatic petroleum product pricing formula is designed to ensure full passthrough to the consumer of all costs, distribution margins, a minimum specific excise
inclusive of customs duties by product, and VAT at the regular rate.
•

The minimum retail price for gasoline (super), kerosene (pétrole lampant), diesel
(gasoil), and fuel oil (fuel 1%) will be calculated by using the price structure of
petroleum products transported by river through the Democratic Republic of the
Congo by applying the specific excise as shown in Table 2.

•

The formula will be calculated at the end of each quarter, using the average f.o.b.
price for the previous 90 days for each product (see Table 2), and this retail price will
apply for the 3 months of the next quarter.

•

The formula adds all costs, distribution margins, a specific excise by product, and
VAT. Thus, the minimum retail price will be the sum of (i) the f.o.b. import price,
(ii) all costs and margins, (iii) the minimum specific excise, and (iv) VAT, which is
applied at the regular rate to the sum of (i)–(iii).

50
•

The minimum specific excise is defined to include the following items:
• (i) droit de douane;
• (ii) taxe communautaire d'intégration;
• (iii) redevance d'usage routier;
• (iv) redevance équipement informatique finances;
• (v) C.C.I.;
• (vi) constitution du stock de sécurité;
• (vii) financement extension capacités de stockage;
• (viii) péréquation sur le transport;
• (ix) redevance ASRP;
• (x) contrôle qualité et quantité des produits, and
• (xi) soutien ou reversement de l’État, which was previously called negative or
positive TUPP, as the residual.

•

In January 2010, the program minimum excises for gasoline, diesel, and fuel oil will
be adjusted by the inflation rate to safeguard government revenue in real terms
(Table 2). The inflation rate to be used will be the November 2009 12-month CPI.
The programmed excises were specified in the TMU attached in the Letter of Intent
dated June 5, 2009 as follows:
• 249.2 CFAF per liter for gasoline,
• 175.2 CFAF per litter for diesel, and
• 73.1 CFAF per liter for fuel oil.

•

Should one or more actual fuel excises as defined in the preceding bullet fall below
the minimum excise specified in Table 2 but the projected excise revenue for all fuel
products for the relevant month exceeds the monthly program target, then for
program purposes, the continuous SB on the automatic adjustment would be
considered met.

•

The same amount of VAT will be charged for petroleum products imported by road
via Cameroon or by river via Kinshasa because the retail price is the same; the
specific excise will be adjusted to yield the same final price as specified above.

•

The retail price for each product would remain fixed for the quarter; however, the
price structure would be issued on a monthly basis with the excise adjusting as a
function of the changes in other costs. The VAT would remain unchanged.
E. Prior Action

Payment of government utility bills
16.
A prior action for the Fifth Review under PRGF arrangement the payment of all
utilities bills submitted to the government by ENERCA, SODECA, and SOCATEL from
November 1, 2008 through August 31, 2009. In the case of disputes about the validity of
bills, they will have to be settled to all involved parties’ satisfaction. A letter of confirmation

51
regarding the full payment of all utility bills submitted during this period signed by the
Ministry of Finance and all 3 utility companies will serve as evidence for the prior action.
F. Quantitative Benchmarks
Net present value of external debt (ceiling)
17.
The NPV of external debt is estimated using the IMF’s external debt sustainability
analysis template for low-income countries.
Reduction in domestic payments arrears (floor)
18.
The reduction in domestic payment arrears measures the change in the stock of total
arrears during the period. Thus, a repayment of existing arrears reduces the stock of arrears
whereas the accumulation of new arrears adds to the stock. For purposes of the program new
arrears are defined on a payment order basis, i.e., as an expenditure for which a payment
order has been issued (dépense ordonnancée), that has not been paid after 60 days. It is
expected that data on the stock of arrears measured according to this definition becomes
available for the assessment of the December 2009. Should there be a delay in the availability
of data, the payment of existing arrears will be used as in previous reviews.
Adjuster
19.
The floor on the reduction in domestic payments arrears will be increased by
29 percent of the regional bond issuance.
Net accumulation of tax arrears (ceiling)
20.
Net accumulation of tax arrears is defined as the difference in the stock of tax
arrears (excluding any amount in litigation) during the period plus any write-offs during that
period.
Poverty-related spending (floor)
21.
Poverty-related spending comprises spending on the following sectors: education,
health, rural development, and social affairs, both spending for the current year and arrears
repayment related to these sectors.
Government payment of utility bills (floor, cumulative)
22.
The quantitative benchmark applies to utility bills issued by public enterprises
Enerca, Socatel, and Sodeca, and is deemed met when at least 98 percent of the combined
utility bills issued by these companies are paid within 60 days of the bill issue date. For
example, the benchmark for end-March 2009 would measure payments on utility bills from
January to March 2009 divided by the utility bills issued November 2008 through
January 2009. The benchmark for end-June would measure the payments on utility bills from

52
January to June divided by the utility bills issued November through April. Cash payments
by the government will be required for all bills issued after August 31, 2009.
Collection ratio of utility companies (floor, cumulative)
23.
The target is measured as the cumulative ratio of total period-t cash collections to
total bills issued during the period with a two-month lag. The target is defined jointly for
ENERCA, SOCATEL, and SODECA. For example, the target for the third quarter would be
the sum of cash collections for the three companies for July–September, 2009, divided by the
value of bills issued May–July 2009. The benchmark for end-December would measure the
sum of cash collections from January to December 2009 divided by the value of bills issued
November 2008 through October 2009.

Safeguards Assessments: The Bank of the Central African States (BEAC) is the
central bank of the CEMAC region. The most recent safeguards assessment of the BEAC
was completed on July 6, 2009. The findings indicate that implementation of previous
safeguards recommendations on financial reporting, internal audit, and internal control has
been limited, and that the changing risk profile of BEAC’s foreign exchange holdings
6

Assistance committed under the original framework is expressed in net present value (NPV) terms at the
completion point, and assistance committed under the enhanced framework is expressed in NPV terms at the
decision point. Hence, these two amounts cannot be added.

7

Under the enhanced framework, an additional disbursement is made at the completion point corresponding to
interest income earned on the amount committed at the decision point but not disbursed during the interim
period.

8

The MDRI provides 100 percent debt relief to eligible member countries that qualified for the assistance.
Grant assistance from the MDRI Trust and HIPC resources provide debt relief to cover the full stock of debt
owed to the Fund as of end-2004 that remains outstanding at the time the member qualifies for such debt relief.

59
requires further actions to strengthen safeguards. Furthermore, BEAC initiated a number of
structural and internal reforms during 2007 aimed at increasing member representation on
governance bodies, strengthening management, and enhancing risk management and
controls. Several of these reforms remain work in progress, and should be impacted by the
ongoing investigations into the Paris fraud case and the measures taken after the conclusions
of these investigations.
Exchange Rate Arrangement
The Central African Republic participates in a currency union with five other members of the
CAEMC and has no separate legal tender. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is
conventional peg; the CFA franc is officially pegged to the euro, the intervention currency, at
a fixed rate of CFAF 655.957 per €1. On September 30, 2009, the rate of the CFA franc in
terms of SDRs was SDR 1 = CFAF 709.74. The exchange system common to all members
operates without restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current
international transactions.
Article IV Consultations
The Central African Republic is currently on the standard 24-month cycle for Article IV
consultations for program countries. The last Article IV consultation was concluded on
September 28, 2007.
Resident Representative
The Fund’s office in Bangui reopened in October 2007 (after being closed in
September 2003). The Resident Representative is Mr. Joseph Ntamatungiro.

Appendix III. Central African Republic: Statistical Issues
As of November 13, 2009
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance.
Issues with source data and compilation affect most datasets, but are particularly problematic
in the real sector.
National Accounts: There is a high degree of uncertainty attached to estimates of the level
and growth rate of real GDP, as estimates for informal sector activity are still based on a
1982 survey. Furthermore, developments in the subsistence agriculture sector, accounting for
an estimated 30 percent of the economy, are not tracked well and would benefit from the
development of source data through surveys. STA is providing technical assistance in
national accounts.
Price statistics: The measurement of inflation is also subject to a high degree of uncertainty
since the CPI is based on expenditure weights that are thirty years old and the index covers
only a limited number of items for the capital city. STA is providing technical assistance in
this area.
Government finance statistics: Data provision is broadly satisfactory for surveillance
purposes, although coverage is not complete. The main shortcomings relate to expenditures
financed by line ministries’ own resources and foreign-financed expenditures, which are
estimated by the Ministry of Finance and are considered to be broadly satisfactory.
Budget accounting procedures continue to suffer from serious shortcomings and delays,
which are addressed though various reforms, including through technical assistance
programs, including the Fund. General government statistics are not available
Monetary statistics: Data provision is broadly satisfactory for surveillance purposes. In mid2007, the BEAC started a project to migrate monetary statistics of CEMAC member
countries to the methodology in the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (2000).

63

Balance of payments statistics: Key shortcomings affect the accuracy and reliability of
balance of payments estimates and relate to source data and the need maintain an up-to-date
business register for surveys (list of respondents, reporting forms, and codification).
Methodologies and statistical techniques also need to be reviewed, particularly the
computation of freight and insurance and procedures for attributing banknote movements
among transactions, while more detail on imports and exports is desirable. For surveillance
purposes, IMF staff must estimate certain items using its own methodologies, including for
freight and insurance, and imports and exports for which details are not available. STA is
providing technical assistance in balance of payments statistics.
External and domestic debt statistics: The quality of external debt data has improved
following reconciliation with external creditors in April 2009 conducted in the context of
reaching the Completion Point under the HIPC initiative. Domestic debt data are of poor
quality, due in part to the difficulty of monitoring all stages of the public expenditure chain
from commitment to payment. On the other hand, the stock of government domestic arrears
has been verified up to end-2007. On remedial measures, the IMF set the introduction of a
government financial management information system as a structural conditionality under the
PRGF, and the system is now operational although it does not cover all payments yet.
II. Data Standards and Quality
The Central African Republic has
participated in the General Data
Dissemination System (GDDS) since June
2004.

No data ROSC is available.

IMF Executive Board Concludes Article IV Consultation with
the Central African Republic
On December 4, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with the Central African Republic. 9
Background
The Central African Republic has recorded modest economic growth since the end of
internal conflict in 2003, recovering from decades of decline in living standards. Real
GDP grew by 2½ percent a year on average during 2004–08. In 2008 and early 2009, a
series of domestic and external shocks hit the economy, beginning with unstable power
supply, followed by price rises in imported commodities, and later the global recession,
which led to slower growth, accelerated inflation, and a higher current account deficit.
Recent performance suggests continued slow growth and moderating inflation. Real
GDP growth is expected to decrease from 2.2 percent in 2008 to 2.0 percent in 2009
while average inflation is forecast to slow from 9.3 percent in 2008 to 3.7 percent in
2009. The current account balance is expected to improve in 2009 due to improvements
in the terms of trade and lower oil import volumes.
Over the last few years the government has been implementing an economic reform
program with the support of the international community. To restore credibility in public
finance and help achieve the objectives of the poverty reduction strategy, a prudent
fiscal stance has been maintained—by recording a small domestic primary surpluses
over 2006–08—and structural reforms have been pursued. The program covers a broad
range of areas including public financial management, debt management, and other key
areas of economic management. Based on these reform efforts, the Central African
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities.

Republic reached completion point under the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor
Countries (HIPC) Initiatives in June 2009.
In the period ahead, the government needs to continue its reform efforts to accelerate
growth and to mobilize resources required for poverty reduction while maintaining debt
sustainability. The main areas of focus are improvement in business and investment
climate, promotion of private sector activities through facilitating access to credits,
efficient mobilization of government revenues, prudent debt management, and
strengthening external sector performance through diversification of export base.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities of the Central African Republic (C.A.R.)
for their continued commitment to prudent macroeconomic management and essential
structural reforms, against the backdrop of a challenging domestic and external
environment. Directors stressed the importance of accelerating economic growth and
boosting competitiveness, while keeping debt sustainable, and of mobilizing the
resources needed for the country’s large peace building and development needs.
Improved security and political stability, particularly in the run-up to the 2010 elections,
are critical to encourage private sector development and realize the authorities’ poverty
reduction strategy.
Directors underscored the importance of further strengthening fiscal management. They
supported the government’s focus on improving revenue administration and widening
the tax base, controlling and monitoring expenditure, boosting priority sector spending,
and better managing expenditure commitments to ensure that they are aligned with
available resources. Continuous implementation of the automatic petroleum pricing
formula will also be important.
Directors stressed the importance of increased donor support on concessional terms to
help the authorities improve the security situation in the short term and, over the
medium term, build the economic management capacity and infrastructure essential to
achieve their poverty reduction and the Millennium Development Goals. They
encouraged the authorities to work closely with donors to ensure a clear understanding
of the country’s financing needs and reform efforts.
Directors welcomed the recent measures to strengthen the financial performance of
public utility enterprises. They called for continued adherence to the program targets on
government payment of utility bills and cash collections of the utility companies so that
these enterprises are provided with adequate resources to maintain key infrastructure.
Directors encouraged the authorities to reduce vulnerabilities in the banking system and
to increase the level of financial intermediation. Progressively replacing government
cash and check payments with bank transactions and less government recourse to bank
financing should help spur private sector access to credit and help diversify the
economy. Directors stressed the need to closely monitor developments in the domestic
banking sector and to take necessary remedial measures for the undercapitalized bank.

67

Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to intensify structural reforms aimed at
improving the business climate, removing infrastructure bottlenecks, and enhancing
governance, the judiciary, and the delivery of public services.
Directors stressed the importance for the authorities to seek full debt relief from all
bilateral and commercial creditors on terms consistent with the HIPC and MDRI
Initiatives. They encouraged the authorities to continue enhancing their debt
management capacity, and avoid the contracting of nonconcessional debt. Directors
noted the authorities’ intention to partially draw on the SDR allocation, which will allow
them to replace more expensive commercial bank financing without increasing
spending.
Directors expressed concern about the governance issues at a foreign office of the
regional central bank, BEAC, and welcomed the bank’s decision to adopt a
comprehensive action plan to address them. They encouraged the C.A.R. authorities to
continue to support the BEAC to resolve these issues and strengthen its governance in
a timely manner.

Press Release No. 09/445
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
December 7, 2009

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Completes Fifth Review Under the PRGF Arrangement for
the Central African Republic and
Approves US$18.5 Million disbursement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has completed the fifth
review of the Central African Republic’s economic performance under a program
supported by the arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF)
for an amount equivalent to SDR 69.62 million (about US$112.21 million). Completion of
the review enables the disbursement of an amount equivalent to SDR 11.455 million
(about US$18.46 million).
The Central African Republic (C.A.R.) has recorded modest economic growth in the
post- conflict period, and income per capita is starting to recover after years of decline.
In 2008 and early 2009, a series of domestic and external shocks—beginning with
unstable power supply, followed by higher prices for imported commodities, and later
the global recession—slowed growth, accelerated inflation, and led to higher current
account deficits. However, recent performance suggests a modest recovery, owing in
part to the implementation of the government’s reform program. Real GDP growth is
projected to increase from 2 percent in 2009 to 3½ percent in 2010 with average CPI
inflation slowing toward 2½ percent in 2010.
Implementation of the C.A.R. authorities’ economic program was deemed satisfactory
and in completing the review, the Executive Board approved a request for a waiver of
the nonobservance of the end-June 2009 quantitative performance criterion on the
ceiling on change in net claims on the government by the commercial banking system.
The Executive Board also approved the modification of all quantitative performance
criteria for end-December 2009.
After the Executive Board’s discussion of the C.A.R.’s economic performance on Friday,
December 4, 2009, Mr. Murilo Portugal, Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair,
issued the following statement:
.

70
“The Central African Republic (C.A.R.) authorities are to be commended for the
satisfactory implementation of the program supported by the arrangement under the
Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF)
“The C.A.R. authorities have made significant progress in improving economic
management. The credibility in public finances has been improved through domestic
revenue mobilization and prudent budget execution. The petroleum product price
adjustment mechanism has been implemented consistently, and taxes on petroleum
products have become a significant and stable source for government revenues. The
authorities now have credible plans to reduce domestic arrears and commercial bank
debt. As a result of these reform measures, the economy is on a sounder basis for
sustaining higher growth.
“The C.A.R. authorities need to continue their reform efforts to accelerate growth and to
mobilize resources required for poverty reduction, while maintaining debt sustainability.
The main areas of focus are efficient mobilization of government revenues, prudent
expenditure and debt management, improvement in business and investment climate,
promotion of private sector activities through facilitating access to credit, and
strengthening external sector performance through diversification of the export base.
The assistance that has been delivered under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries
Initiative and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative should provide significant help to the
authorities’ efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. In addition, the
authorities intend to partly draw on their SDR allocation, which will allow them to replace
more expensive commercial bank financing without increasing spending.
“The C.A.R. authorities recognize the importance of improving the security situation and
maintaining political stability in the period ahead of next year’s elections. Funding is
being provided by donors for the peace building process and elections. Enhanced donor
financial and technical support is also needed to help the authorities strengthen
economic management capacity and address critical infrastructure bottlenecks. The
ongoing measures to strengthen financial performance of public utility enterprises are
expected to help catalyze donor funding in these areas.”
The Executive Board approved a three-year, SDR 36.2 million PRGF arrangement for
the C.A.R. in December 2006 (see Press Release No. 06/299). The Executive Board
approved augmentations of SDR 8.355 million in June 2008 (see Press Release No.
08/142) and SDR 25.065 million in June 2009, when it also approved a six-month
extension of the arrangement (see Press Release No. 09/242). The augmented
arrangement totaling SDR 69.62 million (about US$112.21 million) represents 125
percent of the country’s quota in the Fund.

Statement by Mr. Rutayisire, Executive Director
for Central African Republic
December 4, 2009
On behalf of my Central African Republic authorities, I would like to thank staff for the
constructive and fruitful discussions held during the recent Fund mission in Bangui in
connection with the fifth review under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF)
arrangement, and the 2009 Article IV consultations. My authorities are also thankful for the
continued support of the Executive Board and Management.
Since assuming power, the Central African Republic (CAR) authorities have made steady
progress in consolidating peace and security, and in rebuilding the economy. To consolidate
peace and security, the authorities implemented governance and security sector reforms in
line with the recommendations of the Poverty Reduction Strategy and the resolutions of the
inclusive national dialogue conference held in 2008, and pursued further disarmament,
demobilization, and the reinsertion in civilian activities of former soldiers and rebels. They
are appreciative of the support provided by the international community in this endeavor,
including in particular from the CEMAC, France, and the United Nation’s peace building
mission. These efforts will culminate next year with another cycle of elections which would
further strengthen democratic institutions.
On the economic front, my authorities built on the momentum generated by the attainment of
the completion point to move forward their growth and poverty reduction agenda, and
steadfastly adhered to the PRGF supported economic program in spite of a particularly
challenging environment marked by the global economic crisis and a series of domestic
shocks including recent flooding in Bangui, and electricity power outages. They met all the
quantitative performance criteria except for the criterion restricting credit to the government
from commercial banks. This criterion was not met because of a delayed transfer of resources
from the regional Central Bank, BEAC, to the commercial banks. The authorities took
corrective measures, including by requiring weekly reporting by the liquidity Commission on
the matter. All structural and quantitative benchmarks were met, except for the benchmarks
related to the payments of the government’s public utilities consumption which has been
implemented as a prior action, and the revision of the law on the issuance of sovereign
guaranties which is scheduled to be discussed by the parliament in the context of the
adoption of the 2010 budget.
On the basis of this strong implementation of the program and their commitment to sound
policies as they seek to implement their economic objectives, they request the completion of
the 2009 Article IV consultations, and the fifth review under the PRGF. They also request a
waiver of non observance and modification of performance criteria, and financing assurances
review.

72
IV. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
In spite of the domestic and external shocks, the Central African Republic’s authorities
managed to realize a 2.2 percent GDP growth in 2008. CAR’s GDP growth rate is projected
to remain positive going forward, at a level above the average growth performance of SubSaharan Africa, as the economy recovers from the shocks, specially with the restoration of
electric power supply, and the upturn in exports. The rate of inflation declined, and the
current account position improved following terms of trade improvements.
In fiscal policy, the authorities aimed at creating the fiscal space required to respond to the
crisis and support demand, while ensuring of fiscal sustainability. On the revenue side, the
authorities implemented customs and tax administration reforms, adhered to the petroleum
pricing mechanism and reformed tax policy with a view to improving revenue collection. On
spending, they implemented measures aimed at increasing spending efficiency and
reallocating scarce resources towards priority spending. They also intensified their efforts
towards strengthening their capabilities to monitor and control the expenditure chain, and
increase the transparency of government operations. In result, they achieved their fiscal
surplus target while increasing social spending outlays particularly in the education and
health sectors.
After reaching the completion point and benefiting from debt relief under the HIPC initiative
and MDRI, the authorities intensified their efforts to further reduce public debt and use the
savings thus realized to increase priority spending. They sought to secure the participation of
the remaining bilateral and commercial creditors to the debt relief effort, and with donors’
support, cleared a part of the public sector’s domestic debt arrears.
Monetary and exchange rate policies which are set in the context of the CEMAC monetary
union aimed at controlling inflation following increases in fuel and basic commodities prices.
The authorities welcome the finding that the real exchange rate is in equilibrium. They are
also appreciative of the recent allocation of SDR which they plan to use to bolster their
reserves holdings, and retire expensive indebtedness with commercial banks. A share of the
SDR allocations will be used to retire outstanding claims to the regional Central Bank which
will increase the monetary policy authorities’ options to flexibly respond to future shocks.
As regards structural reforms, the authorities have maintained reforms aimed at increasing
the economy’s resilience to exogenous shocks and promoting a private sector led growth.
They took steps to improve the finances of the public utilities companies, including by
improving the collection ratios on their receivables, and paying for the government’s
consumption of utilities. The authorities also implemented reforms aimed at improving the
business climate, the management of natural resources, and governance.

73
V. CHALLENGES AHEAD AND MEDIUM TERM POLICIES
The authorities immediate priority is the stabilization of the economy in the face of a
challenging external and domestic economic environment, while laying the foundation for a
sustainable and broad based growth path in line with their Poverty Reduction Strategy.
Fiscal Policy
The authorities will pursue a prudent fiscal stance going forward with the view to creating
the fiscal space needed to stabilize demand in the short run, and increase poverty reducing
and growth enhancing outlays. In the medium term, their policies will aim at strengthening
the economy’s resilience to shocks, and preserving fiscal sustainability post MDRI and HIPC
initiative’s debt relief. To that end, they will target a medium term fiscal surplus of 1 percent
of GDP. To achieve this objective, they will implement reforms aimed at further increasing
revenue collection, including through tax and customs administration reforms, and reforms of
the petroleum products taxation. They will also step up efforts aimed at ensuring that
spending is directed towards priority sectors such as the rehabilitation of the electricity
infrastructure, the implementation of the peace process, and the mitigation of the impact of
recent flooding in Bangui. They plan to intensify public financial management reforms, and
with the assistance of the World Bank, conduct a public expenditure review in order to
improve spending efficiency.
After benefiting from debt relief under the HIPC initiative and MDRI, my authorities are
determined to preserve the hard achieved debt sustainability. They will continue efforts
towards securing final debt relief from the remaining bilateral creditors at terms comparable
to HIPC’s. They will further endeavor to improve their debt management capabilities
including by completing the build up of a comprehensive debt database with the inclusion of
domestic debt, and claims on public utilities companies. The debt database will become a
central tool in monitoring and managing public sector indebtedness.
Monetary and Financial Sector Policies
My authorities are committed to the development of the financial sector, through reforms of
the judiciary, the reduction of the government’s reliance on the banking sector which would
enable increased private sector borrowing, and the strengthening of the banking sector’s
balance sheets.
Although CAR’s banking system remains sound, an assessment which is shared by staff, the
authorities are closely monitoring a commercial bank which is under stress. The difficulties
of this bank which had been lingering for many years, was recently exacerbated by the global
financial crisis and difficulties experienced by a major shareholder of the bank. The
authorities ability to contribute to the resolution of the troubled bank had been limited by
conditionality in the PRGF supported program, which was modified recently. Going forward,
the authorities are committed to continue working conjointly with the regional regulatory and

74
supervisory body, COBAC, to monitor the situation and are prepared to swiftly act to
preserve the stability and soundness of CAR’s financial system. In doing so they will closely
consult with the Fund and the stakeholders involved.
Structural Reforms
The authorities structural reforms agenda aims at laying the foundation of a robust and
diversified private sector-led economic recovery. To achieve this goal, they plan to intensify
reforms aimed at improving the business climate, removing infrastructure bottlenecks, and
enhancing governance and the delivery of public services.
In order to alleviate the acute shortages in public utilities, the authorities will invest in
increasing production capacity, particularly in the electricity sector. They will also strive to
improve the balance sheets of major public enterprises through timely payments of
government’s utility consumption, and the clearance of debt arrears owed to these
companies.
The authorities will also take steps to improve the management of the natural resources
sector in order to harness their sizable potential, including through continued compliance
with the EITI initiative, and a review of the mining sector’s legal framework to improve its
competitiveness.
VI. CONCLUSION
Despite severe domestic and external shocks, the CAR authorities have made significant
progress under the Fund supported program in stabilizing their economy, and implementing
their poverty reduction and growth strategy.
As they strive to achieve their development objectives, they face daunting challenges
including limited capacities and significant resources constraints. In particular, the peace and
reconciliation process, and the realization of priority infrastructure projects are beset by
significant funding shortfalls. A strong support from the international community, including
the IMF’s financial and technical assistance, will be critical in sustaining the momentum for
reforms.
In light of the strong program implementation and the authorities commitment to sound
policies going forward, I call on Directors to support my authorities requests.
