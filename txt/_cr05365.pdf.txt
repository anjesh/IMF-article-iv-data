-3EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Economic Developments and Challenges
The improvement in the Solomon Islands’ economic performance registered after the arrival
of the Australian-led intervention force in mid-2003 has continued.
•

The economy has begun to recover. Strong commodity exports and substantial
donor support drove growth and strengthened the external position significantly
in 2004. Inflation moderated from its conflict peak. Likewise, the budget recorded a
large surplus. Although moderating, growth is supported by two major projects
restarting in 2005. The projected deterioration in the external current account reflects
investment-related imports, but reserve coverage should remain comfortable. The
budget is projected to record a small deficit due to one-off factors and higher
spending as capacity and wages rise.

•

Despite a positive near-term outlook, the country faces enormous challenges.
With logging set to decline from its unsustainable level, much depends on new
private activities coming on stream to replace lost incomes, exports, and government
revenue. The Solomon Islands is the poorest country in the Pacific, with per capita
GDP two thirds of its preconflict level. The key challenge is to sustain per capita
income growth and broaden its base, while safeguarding macroeconomic stability.

Key Policy Issues
The discussions focused on the macroeconomic policies needed to support the reform
process over the medium term. Now is a good opportunity to tackle long-standing issues,
provided the forthcoming elections do not derail reforms.
•

A strong fiscal position should be maintained over the medium term. With
expenditure pressures set to rise and revenues projected to fall, staff suggested a
1½ percentage points of GDP adjustment in the 2006 budget. This year’s deficit
should also be kept below budget.

•

The central bank’s policy to resist upward pressure on the exchange rate is
appropriate. The CBSI has de facto pegged the currency to the U.S. dollar
since 2003. Downward pressure on the exchange rate should not be resisted. With the
conduct of monetary policy likely to become more challenging, the CBSI should
continue to stand ready to take appropriate measures, were credit growth to become
inflationary.

•

After regularizing its domestic debt, the government is seeking debt relief from
its external creditors. The staff’s debt sustainability analysis suggests that debt is
high and its dynamics fragile.

•

Structural reforms should be accelerated to promote private sector
development. The new foreign investment regime should be introduced, state
enterprise reform deepened, and governance reform vigorously pursued.

I. BACKGROUND
1.
The recovery that began in mid-2003 has continued, but structural reforms have
lagged. With the restoration of law and order and extensive donor assistance after the
Australian-led intervention-force (Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands,
RAMSI) arrived in mid-2003, macroeconomic stability has been maintained and some
improvements in service delivery achieved. The government has begun addressing some of
the reform priorities identified in the 2003–06 National Economic Recovery, Reform, and
Development Plan (NERRDP)—law and order, good governance, financial stability and
public sector reform, revitalizing the productive sector, rebuilding infrastructure, restoring
basic services, and fostering social development—but progress has been mixed.

countries (PICs), and the gap with the best
performing PICs has almost doubled in the past 20 years. Although data deficiencies hamper
the assessment, several social indicators appear to fall well short of the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs), with high incidence of malaria and almost a third of the
population lacking access to safe water (Annex VI).
3.
While the conflict set the Solomon Islands back, its economic problems have
deeper roots. In particular, obstacles to private sector development—such as limited
infrastructure, ill-defined property rights, and labyrinthine regulations—have made the
economy overly-reliant on timber. Weak governance and public sector management have
also fostered macroeconomic imbalances.
4.
The country is at a cross-roads—logging will decline, and unless growth picks up
elsewhere, living standards will fall. At the current, unsustainable rate, the authorities
estimate that logging will exhaust forests by 2015, making it critical to develop a sustainable
forestry management plan, and create an environment conducive to growth in other sectors—
mainly agricultural commodities, mining, tourism, and small manufacturing.
5.
Previous Article IV consultations have underscored the need to maintain
macroeconomic stability while tackling structural reforms.1 Although macroeconomic

stability has been maintained, progress on structural reforms has been slow. In the fiscal area,
tax administration has improved, and the government has started work on a medium-term
fiscal framework. Nevertheless, recommendations to avoid new income tax exemptions and
generalized wage increases unless in the context of realized savings in the rest of the wage
bill have not been followed. In the structural area, work has started on a wide range of
reforms, but progress, especially on the legislative front, has been slow, as attaining reform
buy-in has required extensive consultations.
6.
The political situation is fluid. The parliamentary elections, scheduled for
early 2006, might make it difficult to accelerate the reform agenda. Further, with volatile
political allegiances and typically a high turnover of parliamentarians in any election, the
result is unpredictable.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK
7.
The recovery should continue this year, keeping the Solomon Islands’ real
growth rate above the regional average. Boosted by logging, real GDP growth was
5½ percent in 2004 for the second year

sustainable rate), but new activities should
raise nonlogging growth to 5 percent from
3¼ percent in 2004. The Solomon Islands’ growth in the past three years has been about
2½ percentage points above the PICs’ average, after several years of underperformance.
8.
After rising to 7.8 percent by end2004, inflation is projected to be broadly
unchanged in 2005, remaining above the
regional average. Inflation rose in 2004
due to increased nontradable demand by
expatriates and rising fuel prices. This year,
inflation is projected to remain at about
the 2004 level, due to the continued passthrough of persistently high oil prices and
the pickup in economic activity.

9.
Following a large improvement in 2004, the external position is projected to be
less favorable in 2005. Export volume growth exceeded 35 percent in 2004, with both
timber and other primary commodity exports booming. This, coupled with low imports and
an almost doubling of current transfers,
Reserves Cover, PICs and Low-income Countries
(In months of next-year's Imports)
resulted in a 12½ percent of GDP current
account surplus. Net international reserves
(NIR) rose to US$76 million (5½ months of
imports)—high by historical and
comparators’ standards—boosted also by
sizable inflows of official development
assistance (Table 2 and Figure 2). The
deterioration expected in 2005, with the
current account shifting to a deficit of
11 percent of GDP, is mainly due to the
high import content of investment projects, a rising oil import bill, and recovery from a low
import base. With development grants and FDI (linked almost entirely to the two major
projects underway) expected to be strong, NIR should decline only marginally to about
US$75 million, 4.5 months of projected 2006 imports.

After an unusually large surplus in 2004, the fiscal position is projected to post a
small deficit.2 The central government surplus was 8¼ percent of GDP in 2004 due to higher
grants, improved tax collection, eliminating militia payments, tighter expenditure controls,
and limited spending capacity (Table 3 and Figure 3). Strong growth and clearing of most
domestic arrears cut the public debt-to-GDP ratio to 92 percent from 122 percent in 2003.
Despite further tax revenue gains, a small deficit (½ percent of GDP) is projected in 2005, as
spending capacity and the wage bill rise, and external direct budget support falls. The public
debt-to-GDP ratio should fall again modestly, but the realization of contingent liabilities
equivalent to 6½ percent of GDP is projected to lead to a slightly higher NPV of external
debt to GDP and to exports, both above thresholds.
Reserve money growth was primarily reflected in a large buildup of banks’
excess reserves in 2004, but credit growth has recently picked up. Soaring net foreign
assets at the central bank led to a 74 percent rise in reserve money in 2004, despite a buildup
of government deposits (Table 4 and Figure 4). Banks’ caution limited real private credit
growth to 2.5 percent and resulted in banks accumulating excess reserves amounting to
39 percent of deposits. Reflecting the pickup in economic activity, real private credit growth
rose to 21 percent year-on-year in May and banks’ excess reserves dropped to 32 percent of
deposits.

Due to data availability, the analysis of the fiscal position is limited to the central
government.

III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
12.
With broad agreement on the challenges facing the Solomon Islands, discussions
focused on the macroeconomic policies needed to support the reform process over the
medium term. The critical challenges are to sustain growth, broaden its base, and address
poverty, while safeguarding fiscal sustainability and sound monetary and financial sector
policies. It was recognized that structural reforms play a key role in achieving these goals.
While highlighting the risks of inaction, staff stressed that the current situation offers an
opportunity to tackle long-standing issues, provided budget discipline is maintained and
large donor assistance continues as expected.
A. Medium-Term Outlook
13.

Two key uncertainties shroud the medium-term outlook:
•

The contribution of logging and activities that could replace it. The
contribution of logging to growth over the next few years depends on whether
sustainable forestry management will be introduced and, if so, when. The
contribution of other sectors to growth, mainly agricultural commodities and
mining, will depend on investor confidence and an improved business
environment, as well as technical factors affecting individual sectors, such as
mining exploration.

•

The amount and timing of donor flows. The largest single donor, Australia,
recently committed funding for AusAID and RAMSI through 2009, with
indications that assistance will continue beyond that date. The European Union
has pledged a substantial amount, although disbursements have been slow. New
Zealand’s budget support is scheduled to end in 2006, but continued assistance
has been signaled. While these flows are expected to continue to be sizable over
the next several years, they will likely moderate and, their pace and size remain
unpredictable.

14.
The staff’s baseline medium-term macroeconomic scenario illustrates the
potential rewards of the authorities’ planned reforms. Under the assumptions that
macroeconomic stability is maintained, a critical mass of structural reforms is implemented
(see below), and RAMSI and donors stay engaged, staff projects that annual growth could
plausibly average about 4½ (1½ per capita) percent in 2006–10, driven mainly by private
investment and exports (Annex I, and Tables 5 and 6). Inflation is projected to decline
gradually. The external current account deficit would peak in 2006, due to imported capital
goods, and narrow gradually over the projection horizon as export capacity is developed.
Reserves would fall modestly as aid moderates, but reserve coverage would stabilize at four
months of imports. Nevertheless, all projections are subject to considerable uncertainty.
15.
Risks to the baseline scenario are skewed to the downside, even though a
faultless implementation of reforms might engender a stronger supply response.

-8-

Downside risks stem from lackluster policy implementation, political instability, lower donor
flows and international commodity prices, and disruptions in the development of major
projects. Staff views setbacks in policy implementation as the main risk at least in the near
term, partly because of the upcoming elections. Further, this phase of economic reform is
more difficult than the initial stabilization, as it requires confronting vested interests and
improving governance. A slow reform process, simulated in the staff’s alternative scenario,
would undermine macroeconomic stability and could limit donor support (Table 7). Lack of
economic opportunities could also rekindle ethnic tensions. Given high external
vulnerability, the external position would deteriorate if new export activities do not
commence, also because private remittances are not sizable (Table 8). In such a scenario,
debt service arrears would likely accumulate and imports contract. The fiscal accounts would
also come under strain and force a large reduction in public services and spending. On the
other hand, a stronger reform drive with flawless implementation could push growth to an
annual average of about 6 percent in 2006–10.
16.
The authorities broadly agreed with the staff’s analysis, and underscored the
complexity of their task. They welcomed the focus on the medium term and expressed their
intention to advance reforms to stimulate growth, while pointing out that slow
implementation of some infrastructure projects also reflected donors’ slow disbursements.
The authorities shared the view that growth needs to be private-sector led, with the public
sector establishing the enabling environment. Further, they explained that the government’s
current poverty reduction strategy centers around promoting growth, and noted that the
subsistence economy plays an important role in alleviating extreme poverty and providing a
buffer against shocks. Nevertheless, highlighting the difficulties, the authorities described
their starting point as comprising a degraded public sector, weak institutions, and obsolete or
non-existing infrastructure.
B. Fiscal Policy
17.
The 2005 budget envisages a shift to a 1½ percent of GDP deficit from an
8¼ percent of GDP surplus in 2004. About half of the deterioration in the budget balance is
due to exceptional, one-off factors, primarily Australia ending direct budget support
(3.3 percent of GDP) and revenue from a tax amnesty and payment of back taxes (1 percent
of GDP) in 2004, and a civil servants bonus paid in June 2005 (0.8 percent of GDP). Also,
the budget allocates additional resources for key priorities and higher spending is partly due
to the government’s taking over some programs previously run by donors. While
acknowledging the importance of the special factors affecting the budget in 2004–05, staff
cautioned against an overly expansionary fiscal stance and its implications for the budget
over the medium term, arguing that the budgeted expenditure increase could be too large to
be spent well at current capacity levels and that a stronger budget balance would avoid
frequent changes of direction in fiscal policy.
18.
Staff advised saving any revenue over-performance and any under-spending on
investment projects and in other areas that may occur this year, while holding current
expenditure tightly to the budget. Tax revenue is likely to over-perform as tax

-9-

administration improvements yield results, and logging and import duties are on track to
exceed budget estimates. The pace of domestically-financed capital spending, some
government programs, and the process of filling vacancies are again likely to fall prey to
capacity constraints. Some current spending overruns, especially in administrative and
representation costs, are expected, but should not fully offset other factors. Provided the
government resists emerging spending pressures in nonpriority areas, the budget outturn
could be roughly 1 percent of GDP better than budgeted.3 The authorities noted that
expenditure pressures were intensifying, but were fairly confident to keep within budget even
if the contingency warrants are spent. Under existing legislation, the cabinet has the power to
spend a certain amount beyond parliamentary appropriations, the so-called contingency
warrants, which in 2005 amount to 1 percent of GDP for recurrent outlays and an equal
amount for development spending. In the staff’s projection, only the recurrent contingency
warrant is assumed to be utilized.
19.
Medium-term fiscal risks loom.4 Besides spending pressures arising from wage
demands and administrative costs, social, infrastructure, and operations and maintenance
needs are likely to strain the budget going forward. An anticipated decline in aid flows over
time is one source of these pressures, as services currently offered by donors, as well as
infrastructure construction projects will be taken on by the government. Maintenance costs
for new infrastructure will also become an increasingly important source of these pressures.
On the revenue side, direct foreign budgetary support is likely to decline further, and tax
receipts from logging and imports (due to tariff reductions as part of the Pacific Island
Countries Trade Agreement) are expected to fall. Moreover, the government still has a
substantial stock of arrears, and debt servicing costs are projected to rise.
20.
To meet the medium-term challenge that the Solomon Islands faces, the
authorities agreed that the 2006 budget should seek to consolidate the fiscal position.
Given limited sources of financing and the need to reduce public debt to safer levels, an
adjustment of about 1½ percentage points of GDP would be appropriate and is feasible. It
could be obtained by ensuring this year’s 16 percent bonus to civil servants is not
incorporated in base salaries (equivalent to about ¾ percent of GDP), further tax
administration gains, containing nonproductive outlays, and, if necessary, by adjusting
excises, fees, and the determined prices for logs (which has not been done in years).
21.
The authorities said that decisions regarding the composition of public
expenditure require careful medium-term planning. Currently, donors are providing
several basic government services. Spending for police and law and justice is high in the
3

In contrast to budget support grants, development grants, for which very limited data exist
and are estimated by staff, are currently administered directly by donors, and hence cannot
directly generate a surplus for the government budget.

present post-conflict situation and should decline over time. Also, these services will cost
less once provided by local personnel. Nevertheless, as donors scale down their activities, the
government will need to decide which services to provide, as well as the level of
infrastructure spending.
22.
The authorities have started work toward a medium-term fiscal framework and
welcomed the staff’s proposal of a combined-source budget. A medium-term fiscal
framework would help determine the resource envelope and avoid large swings in the level
of public services. Incorporating donor flows into a combined-source budget would be an
important tool to help the government decide on the level of services, by providing a
quantification of the overall level of services currently offered, at present unavailable due to
scant information on donor activities. It should also improve the fit between the
government’s priorities and donors’ projects and facilitate donor coordination.
23.

framework. To deal with the tension between
containing the wage bill and filling critical vacancies, room for needed qualified
professionals could be created by rationalizing civil service employment and decompressing
the wage scale. In the social sectors, obtaining better outcomes for already sizable levels of
spending and reallocating resources toward primary education and health care has priority.
24.
Over the medium-term, widening the tax base is imperative. While the tax
revenue-to-GDP ratio is broadly in line with other PICs, tax rates, with the exception of
excises, are among the highest in the region. Staff urged the authorities not to grant new tax
exemptions, reduce the scope of existing ones, and continue implementing the Pacific
Financial Technical Assistance Center’s (PFTAC) recommended tax and customs
administrative reforms. The authorities responded that no future tax holidays are envisaged,
but noted that the backlog of logging duty exemptions would continue to erode revenue for
some time.

25.
The tax reform being considered by the authorities envisages a VAT-type tax as
the linchpin of the indirect taxation system. The authorities noted that the proposed tax
reform would have several advantages, notably eliminating distortionary effects, especially
cascading under the present goods and sales taxes, removing most of the existing
exemptions, and providing an alternative revenue source to replace the loss from import and
logging duties anticipated over the medium term. Later, the tax reform would also simplify
direct income taxes and lower rates.
26.
Staff advised caution on fiscal decentralization. As plans to implement a federal
system are being actively discussed, they continued to advise that fiscal decentralization was
not prudent until public finances and administrative capacity strengthen and would likely
entail weaker fiscal discipline. The authorities noted that the aim of decentralization would
be to improve service delivery in the provinces and that any move toward decentralization
would take a long time to implement. If this proposal were to go ahead, safeguards to prevent
local governments from borrowing should be put in place.
C. Debt
27.
The authorities described their debt situation as “unsustainable,” and were keen
to regularize it. They pointed to the narrow revenue

Honiara Club under the auspices of a broker as more
propitious than bilateral negotiations. They expected that these negotiations would start after
the conclusion of this consultation. On the domestic side, having restructured domestic bonds
in 2004, the government is gradually paying expenditure arrears owed mainly to suppliers

- 12 -

(amounting to about 8 percent of GDP) and formulating plans on how to handle the largest
claims.
28.
Staff encouraged the government to normalize relations with its creditors and
discussed the debt sustainability analysis (DSA). Staff also underscored the importance of
honoring future debt service obligations. The staff’s DSA suggests that debt is high, with
some indicators currently above thresholds, and its dynamics fragile (see Annex I). Although
debt indicators improve over time in the baseline scenario, some scenarios and shocks, even
some temporary ones, could cause debt ratios to deteriorate significantly. These findings,
combined with the country’s poor credit history, and the high likelihood of further contingent
liabilities being realized, suggest that the Solomon Islands is at high risk of debt distress.
D. Exchange Rate and Monetary Management
29.
Staff continued to support the CBSI’s policy to resist upward pressure on the
exchange rate in the face of strong foreign inflows. After depreciating by 34 percent
in 2002, primarily reflecting the civil unrest, the CBSI has de facto pegged the Solomon
Islands dollar to the U.S. dollar since early 2003, and has indicated that this exchange rate
regime would be maintained in the near term.
Exchange Rat es
Staff supported this policy as reserve
(Index NEER/REER: 2000=100)
accumulation in these circumstances is
appropriate because large aid flows are expected
to be volatile, and taking this opportunity to build
reserves helps buffer the economy against the
influence of these flows and potential external
shocks. An appreciation of the exchange rate
would reduce external competitiveness, and
although export performance is heavily influenced by supply factors, it would undesirably
disadvantage exporters additionally through prices.

As aid flows diminish and imports grow in line with the economy, staff suggested
that downward pressure on the exchange rate should not be resisted. Given the country’s
exposure to external shocks and the priority of maintaining an adequate level of reserves, the
CBSI agreed with this advice, and indicated that the exchange rate regime would be
reviewed when necessary. They explained that, at a minimum, reserves should cover 3½
months of imports and agreed that the real exchange rate level—almost 20 percent lower
than pre-conflict levels—appears broadly adequate at present, as indicated by the positive
performance of nontimber exports.
31.
The exchange rate has so far provided an effective nominal anchor, but going
forward the conduct of monetary policy is likely to become more challenging. Inflation
has remained below 8 percent in the past two years, but continued strong foreign inflows and
a substantial drawdown of government deposits or banks’ excess reserves as credit rises
could jeopardize the CBSI’s single digit indicative target, given the limited instruments at its
disposal. The Governor explained that, if credit growth were to become inflationary, the

- 13 -

CBSI stands ready to take appropriate measures, including moral suasion and administrative
measures, if necessary. Improving the functioning of the T-bill market could also be pursued
to develop indirect instruments for liquidity management in the future, but its contribution in
the short run would be limited due to the perceived risk of government debt.5
E. Financial Sector Issues
32.
The commercial banking system continues to perform well, while the
development bank should be liquidated. All commercial banks—comprising two foreign
banks with a combined market share of 57 percent and a local private bank—are well
capitalized and the aggregate capital to risk-weighted assets ratio is over 25 percent. Asset
quality has improved with a decline in nonperforming loans to 1.9 percent of total from
5.5 percent at end–2003. Despite the recent fall, profitability remains robust (return on equity
averages about 20 percent) and liquidity is high.6 The CBSI, as the court-appointed manager,
has made progress in repaying depositors of the troubled Development Bank of the Solomon
Islands (DBSI) and shrinking its balance sheet. Staff advised to liquidate the DBSI and
confront the challenge of financing the institution’s liquidation, currently estimated to cost
¾ percent of GDP.
33.
The profitability of the National Provident Fund (NPF) remains a concern.
Despite improved liquidity, poor asset quality (nonperforming assets are estimated at
13 percent of total) and low yields affect the NPF’s ability to generate a return sufficient to
cover operating costs and the 2.5 percent annual return to contributors mandated by law. The
authorities noted that greater transparency in the NPF’s operations had already been
introduced and efforts were being made to improve governance and redefine the objectives of
the institution to protect members’ contributions, including by preparing a new NPF bill.
Staff recognized the benefits of allowing the NPF to invest abroad, especially given limited
domestic investment opportunities, but advised that conservative investment guidelines be
adopted to prevent asset mismanagement.
34.
Staff welcomed the progress on anti-money laundering and combating the
financing of terrorism (AML/CFT). After the amended AML Act came into force in May,
the CBSI issued the Customer Due Diligence guidelines to banks to introduce reporting
requirements for AML/CFT. With the Fund’s and donors’ assistance, a financial intelligence
unit is in the process of being established.

The development of the T-bill market is discussed in the Selected Issues paper.

While deposit-lending spreads remain high due to the high risk environment, banks typically
offer lower lending rates to clients with good creditworthiness and hence high spreads are not
deemed an obstacle to private sector development. Although spreads obviously contribute, the
major source of banks’ profitability are foreign exchange transactions.

- 14 -

F. Structural Reforms and Other Issues
35.
The newly established Economic Reform Unit is leading several reform efforts to
meet the NERRDP objectives, but much remains to be done to implement them. The
authorities and staff shared the view that reforms to promote a better business environment,
reforming state-owned enterprises (SOEs), enhancing infrastructure, and improving
governance are key priorities, with building civil service capacity a prerequisite for all of
them. Staff highlighted the signaling effect of individual reforms reaching the
implementation stage and the importance of sustaining the reform momentum to support
business confidence.
36.
A new foreign investment bill is spearheading the efforts to improve the business
environment. The proposed bill would reform the investment regime—rendering the
registration process simpler, more transparent, and nondiscretionary—but awaits
parliamentary passage. Staff also encouraged the authorities to proceed with a review of
investment incentives and administrative barriers to businesses (especially, business
licensing procedures and foreign labor permits), which the Foreign Investment Advisory
Service of the International Finance Corporation is facilitating.
37.
SOE restructuring has advanced somewhat. Staff commended the authorities’
efforts to restructure Solomon Airlines, expected to be ready for privatization in late 2005,
and suggested that it might serve as a model for reforming other SOEs. With the assistance of
the World Bank, a draft restructuring plan for the Solomon Islands Electricity Authority has
been prepared, although some key decisions have yet to be made. It is expected that the
restructuring of the Water Authority would start next. A review of the regulatory
environment for utilities is also being considered and the audited accounts of public
enterprises are being prepared. SOE restructuring would improve service delivery and
support the revival of economic activity, as well as reduce fiscal risks, as some of these
companies are making losses mainly financed via inter-institution arrears.
38.
With external assistance, infrastructure is slowly starting to be rebuilt. Financed
by donors, road construction and other infrastructure projects have recently commenced. The
Asian Development Bank (AsDB) is assisting the government in strengthening the ministry
of infrastructure and develop a national transport plan. Inter-island shipping, a key ingredient
to rural development, is also being addressed and additional wharves are being built.
39.
The authorities recognize the importance of better governance and, with
RAMSI’s assistance, are making progress in several areas. Last July, parliament
approved legislation to introduce a single ballot box, which is expected to reduce the scope
for vote-buying. Programs to strengthen many institutions, including parliament, the justice
system and watchdogs, and increase the participation of civil society in oversight are under
way. Some economic institutions, for example the Ministry of Finance and the NPF, have
become more transparent by publishing regular press briefings and their accounts.

- 15 -

40.
The authorities are improving the statistical database, which is barely adequate
for surveillance and continues to hamper it (Annex VII). Data deficiencies are significant
in the real, fiscal, and external sectors. With the exception of crude GDP estimates, national
accounts have not been produced since 1994. Very limited data are available on donor
activities and the accounts of public institutions outside the central government do not exist.
Partial balance of payments data are estimated using foreign exchange transactions, and are
suspected to misstate trade. These shortcomings make assessing the fiscal stance and the
external position challenging. The National Statistical Office (NSO) is beginning a
household income and expenditure survey this October, plans to prepare complete national
accounts in 2006, and is preparing preliminary trade estimates based on customs data. Staff
and the authorities agreed on the need to collect data on aid flows and produce accounts for
public institutions outside the central government.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
41.
The notable improvement in the Solomon Islands’ economic performance, which
started after RAMSI’s arrival, has continued. Against the backdrop of improved security,
macroeconomic stability has been maintained and economic activity has rebounded. The
authorities have achieved better service delivery and started to work on structural reform.
Aid flows have risen, and donors have pledged assistance for some time to come.
42.
Nevertheless, major challenges remain. The key issue is to sustain per capita
growth over the medium term, while logging will decline from its present unsustainable rate.
This requires embracing structural reform and setting macroeconomic policies within a
longer-term horizon. Structural reforms are needed to promote private sector development.
Fiscal reforms have to ensure adequate provision of government services and infrastructure
without jeopardizing fiscal sustainability. Price stability is necessary for a stable
macroeconomic environment. Now is a good opportunity to tackle long-standing issues, but
risks are skewed to the downside.
43.
Given limited financing sources and the need to reduce public debt, the
government must consolidate its budget. A start toward this could be made by ensuring
that this year’s budget outturn comes in better than budgeted. This could be achieved by
saving any revenue overperformance and any underspending, while holding current outlays
tightly to the budget. There is also an opportunity in the 2006 budget to consolidate the fiscal
position by ensuring one-off bonuses paid to civil servants in 2005 do not enter base salaries,
pursuing further tax administration gains, and containing nonproductive expenditure.
Although debt indicators improve under the baseline scenario, fragile debt dynamics and the
country’s credit history suggest that the Solomon Islands is at high risk of debt distress. The
authorities should normalize relations with creditors as soon as possible.
44.
Over the medium term, the efficiency of government spending will have to be
substantially raised and revenue should be kept broadly constant in relation to GDP.
Spending decisions and a civil service reform should be set within a medium-term budget
framework and a combined-source budget incorporating aid flows. The government should

- 16 -

start re-orienting expenditure away from the wage bill and toward infrastructure,
maintenance, and primary education and health care. No new tax exemptions should be
granted and the scope of existing ones curtailed. The proposed tax reform would go a long
way in improving revenue generation. Fiscal decentralization, at least until public finances
and capacity strengthen, would be imprudent and would likely weaken fiscal discipline.
45.
The policy of stabilizing the exchange rate in the face of strong foreign inflows is
appropriate. The CBSI has de-facto pegged the Solomon Islands dollar since early 2003 and
rebuilt reserves, as large aid flows are expected to be temporary and volatile. However,
downward pressure on the exchange rate should not be resisted given the country’s exposure
to external shocks and the priority assigned to maintaining an adequate reserve level.
External competitiveness appears adequate at present.
46.
The exchange rate regime has so far served the country well as a nominal
anchor, but going forward, the conduct of monetary policy could become more
challenging. As the CBSI has recognized, continued strong foreign inflows combined with a
drawdown of government deposits and an acceleration in private credit growth might
jeopardize its indicative single digit inflation target. The CBSI should continue to stand
ready to rein in credit growth, including, if necessary, via administrative measures, given
limited instruments at its disposal.
47.
The commercial banking system continues to perform satisfactorily, though the
NPF’s weak profitability is a concern and the DBSI should be liquidated. Commercial
banks are well capitalized and asset quality has improved. The NPF, however, continues to
suffer from low profitability, despite improved liquidity. Letting the institution invest abroad
could be beneficial, but strict investment guidelines should be adopted first. The new NPF
bill should be passed. Pressures to revive the DBSI should be resisted and the bank
liquidated.
48.
Structural reforms play a crucial role in creating an enabling business
environment for private sector development and achieving higher per capita income.
Passage of the foreign investment bill would send a signal to investors and donors about the
authorities’ commitment to reform. Deepening and extending SOE reform, in particular of
the utilities, is needed to improve service delivery and reduce fiscal risks. Infrastructure is
slowly being rebuilt, which is key to boost new economic activities. Better governance and
institution strengthening are afoot in a number of areas and their continuation is critical in
maintaining confidence and ensuring equal opportunities for all in society.
49.
The statistical database is barely adequate for surveillance and continues to hamper
it. Data shortcomings in the real, fiscal, and external sectors, hinder the assessment of the fiscal
stance and external position. Nonetheless, remedial efforts are under way in a number of areas.
50.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be conducted on the 12month cycle.

ANNEX I

SOLOMON ISLANDS: MEDIUM-TERM SCENARIO AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS1
If the government implements its reform agenda, the Solomon Islands could enjoy higher
living standards over the medium term, although its debt situation remains fragile. If
necessary reforms are not implemented, however, living standards and debt indicators
could deteriorate further.
Medium-term scenario
The staff’s baseline medium-term framework is underpinned by policy adjustment. It
assumes that RAMSI and donors remain engaged, and although declining, aid flows continue
to be substantial (9 percent of GDP in 2010 from 20 percent in 2005), and logging activity is
halved. It also assumes that a critical mass of structural reforms is implemented so that new
private activities take up the slack left by logging. Finally, it assumes that financial stability
is maintained, underpinned by fiscal adjustment. In line with government policy, no new
borrowing takes place.2 However, downside risks to this scenario, particularly related to
policy implementation, are high.
Under these assumptions, real GDP growth is projected to average 4½ percent in 2006–
10, driven largely by investment and exports (Tables 5 and 6). Per capita income would
rise by a cumulative 10 percent and inflation decline gradually to 5 percent as supply
constraints ease. In spite of declining logging, exports grow strongly over the medium term,
especially in 2006, as new export activities—primarily palm oil and mining—come on
stream and expand. The current account deficit peaks (at around 13½ percent of GDP)
in 2006 due to imported capital goods, and narrows over the projection horizon to around
4 percent of GDP. Reserves fall modestly as official development assistance (ODA)
moderates and external debt repayments jump in 2008, but reserve coverage stabilizes at
around 4 months of imports. The overall fiscal position is projected to improve resulting in
modest budget surpluses over the medium term, with expenditure adjustment of 1½ percent
of GDP and further revenue measures keeping the revenue-to-GDP ratio broadly constant,
while import and logging duties fall by 2½ percent of GDP between 2005 and 2010.3
If reforms stall causing donors and investors to leave, macroeconomic stability would
likely falter (Table 7). Under such an alternative scenario, growth is projected to slow to
about 1½ percent, leaving real per capita income 6.5 percent lower by 2010 and almost
14 percent below the baseline. Inflation could gradually rise to 10 percent as supply
1

Prepared jointly with World Bank staff.

2

Staff assumes no gross external borrowing throughout the projection horizon. Net domestic
borrowing remains negative throughout the projection period.

3

Staff assumes that the government gradually eliminates outstanding informal expenditure arrears
by 2010, and realized contingent liabilities (of around 1.5 percent of GDP) to the NPF by 2015.

- 30 -

ANNEX I

constraints reemerge. Production and exports weaken, and lower ODA and no FDI result in
considerable import compression. With weaker growth limiting revenue, no revenue
measures to compensate falling logging and import duties, and an inability to borrow, the
government is forced to reduce recurrent spending by one fifth, with service provision falling
further in line with lower ODA. Unpaid debt service adds to arrears, with government debt
largely unchanged in 2010 from its level at end-2006.
Debt sustainability in the baseline scenario4
The external debt sustainability analysis under the baseline scenario paints a mixed
picture (Annex I Table 1).5 At end-2004, the NPV of external debt to GDP (at 45 percent)
exceeded the Board-endorsed indicative threshold, while the ratios of the NPV of debt to
exports and revenue were below their respective thresholds. However, with the recent
realization of an external contingent liability worth 5 percent of GDP, the ratios of the NPV
of debt to both GDP and exports are projected to exceed their respective thresholds at end2005.6
In the baseline adjustment scenario, all debt indicators improve over time. The NPV of
debt to exports is projected to fall below its threshold in 2006, but the NPV of debt to GDP
still exceeds its threshold in 2010. Debt service to both exports and revenue (at 5.5 and
9.3 percent, respectively, in 2005) always remain below thresholds.
The high level of domestic debt and informal expenditure arrears pose significant risks
to fiscal sustainability (Annex I Table 2). At end-2004, domestic debt was 30 percent of
GDP (including expenditure arrears), bringing total public debt (including arrears) to
92 percent of GDP. Reflecting the realization of both the external contingent liability as well
as domestic contingent liabilities worth 1.5 percent of GDP, public debt to GDP is projected
to fall only slightly in 2005.7 While all debt indicators decline under the baseline, the NPV of
public debt remains above 100 percent of government domestic revenue and around
30 percent of GDP even in 2015.

4

Data on private external, state enterprise, and provincial government debt are not available.
Therefore, the analysis is limited to central government debt data.
5

This analysis assumes that the government remains current on all obligations from mid-2005, and
that all debt in arrears is treated as a current short-term obligation with NPV equal to its face value.
Existing external arrears are assumed to continue growing with accrued interest.

6

The realized contingent liability relates to a government-guaranteed loan which the creditor called in
during 2005. The loan was originally made to the government fishing company, Soltai, but was later
transferred to the Investment Corporation of the Solomon Islands which has been unable to service it.
7

The domestic contingent liabilities realized this year relate to loans made by the NPF to provincial
governments and guaranteed by the central government.

ANNEX I

Risks to the debt dynamics
Historical scenarios and even some temporary stress tests highlight the fragility of the
Solomon Islands’ debt position (Annex I Tables 3 and 4).
•

External Debt: A return of key variables to their historical averages would see the ratio of
the NPV of debt to exports and GDP rise during the projection period. Even a temporary
fall in export growth would see the NPV of debt to exports jump and exceed the
threshold almost throughout the period to 2025 and result in an external debt service ratio
above its threshold for two years before 2010. A temporary fall in GDP growth would
keep the NPV of debt to GDP above its threshold past 2010 and the NPV of debt to
exports above its threshold to 2008. The concentration of exports, and their historical
volatility, suggest these are very relevant stress tests for assessing vulnerability.8

•

Public Debt: Lower GDP growth, even temporarily, and a return of growth and the
primary balance to their historical averages result in the ratios of the NPV of public debt
to GDP and revenue rising.

These results are indicative only, as major uncertainties surround critical variables. In
particular, macroeconomic variables (especially GDP) are subject to large measurement
errors. Data on aid flows are extremely limited, and staff estimates, based on discussions
with donors, are subject to great uncertainty as future ODA plans are sketchy.
Contingent liabilities—currently estimated at 10 percent of GDP—are another key
source of uncertainty. If all were realized as external debt, the NPV of debt would exceed
30 percent of GDP even in 2015. Additional contingent liabilities are likely to be uncovered
as audits of state enterprise and provincial government accounts are underway for the first
time in many years. Since state enterprises and provincial governments have few resources, a
large share of any contingent liabilities related to them is likely to be realized.
The Solomon Islands is at high risk of debt distress. Some external debt indicators are
currently above thresholds and domestic debt, arrears, and contingent liabilities are also high.
Although debt indicators fall over the medium term under the staff’s adjustment scenario,
historical scenarios and several stress tests, even some temporary ones, lead to a deterioration
in the debt burden. These tests seem especially relevant given the Solomon Islands’ volatile
economic history, and the nascent stage of the current reforms and recovery process. These
findings, together with the country’s poor credit history, suggest that the Solomon Islands is
at high risk of debt distress.

The coefficient of variation of export growth was almost -6 over the last ten years, with roughly the
same volatility in absolute terms over the period since 1978.

Estimate

1/ Gross central government debt, including informal arrears. Foreign currency denominated debt converted using end-of-period exchange rate.
2/ Current estimate of contingent liabilities recognition. Remaining contingent liabilities are estimated at 10 percent of GDP.
3/ Gross financing need is defined as the primary deficit plus debt service plus the stock of short-term debt at the end of the last period.
4/ Revenues excluding grants.
5/ Debt service is defined as the sum of interest and amortization of medium and long-term debt.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.

Sources: Data provided by the authorities; and Fund staff estimates.

Sources: Data provided by the authorities; and Fund staff estimates.
1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and nondebt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline, while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Assumes an interest rate equal to U.S. 6 month Libor + 2 percent.
3/ Liabilities realized and add to arrears from the beginning of 2006, attracting an interest rate equal to 2004 six month libor.
4/ Ratios calculated using baseline export-to-GDP, since GDP and exports are driven by the same primary commodities.
5/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock
(implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
6/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
7/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
8/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

VIII. Exchange Rate Arrangements:
Since November 2000, the exchange rate for the Solomon Islands (SI) dollar has been
based on an undisclosed trade-weighted basket of the currencies of the Solomon
Islands’ major trading partners, with the US dollar as the intervention currency.
During 2002, as pressures on external reserves intensified, the Central Bank of
Solomon Islands (CBSI) accelerated the rate of currency depreciation, leading to a
gradual real depreciation of the SI dollar. Since December 2002, the CBSI has kept
the exchange rate broadly stable against the US dollar, although there is no public
commitment to continue to do so. Exchange restrictions reintroduced starting in 2000
were removed in 2003. The Solomon Islands now maintains an exchange system that
is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current
international transactions.

SOLOMON ISLANDS: SUPPORT FROM THE PACIFIC FINANCIAL
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CENTER1
(As of July 2005)
Tax administration and policy
A mission in May 2004 designed plans and a time-table for modernizing and enhancing the efficiency
of the Customs and Tax Divisions. The authorities agreed to the strategy and have decided to proceed
with implementation. The authorities have laid the groundwork for further modernization by:
appointing two project managers (Tax & Customs) who will be funded by AusAID; requesting
NZAID to fund the implementation of required computer software in the Customs Division;
implementing a computer system to help manage the operations of the Inland Revenue Division
(IRD) that will be funded by AusAID, and implementing a new organizational structure for IRD,
which includes a Large Taxpayer Unit. Meanwhile, a new income tax bill to provide a final PAYE
withholding system has been drafted with the assistance of LEG.

A further mission in May 2005 reviewed the current tax system. The mission outlined a detailed
strategy for the implementation of tax reform over the next few years and assessed the required
technical assistance to support this strategy. It is anticipated that PFTAC and the Fund’s LEG will
assist with the implementation process and a request for legal drafting for the new tax policy reform
package is expected shortly.
Financial sector regulation and supervision
The Central Bank of Solomon Islands (CBSI) has been assigned considerable new responsibilities,
including the supervision of insurance companies and the establishment of a Financial Intelligence
Unit (FIU). In September 2004, an advisor visited the CBSI to advise on the implementation of an
anti-money laundering regime. A peripatetic consultant visited in January 2005 to assist with
streamlining the financial reporting system; and experts visited in February and May 2005 to review
the supervision and regulation of the insurance industry. In April 2005, a PFTAC expert worked with
an MFD expert to provide assistance on the supervision of an insurance company; provide advice on
oversight of the Solomon Islands National Provident Fund; develop supervisory guidelines on
AML/CFT activities in financial institutions and prepare a project document for establishment of a
FIU. CBSI staff also attended a seminar on monetary policy in shallow markets arranged by
PFTAC/MFD in March 2005.
Economic and financial statistics
During 2003, the National Statistics Office (NSO) restarted activity, with the production of the Honiara
CPI. A PFTAC mission in February 2004 devised a recovery plan, and AusAID and NZAID have
committed to provide funding for a long-term advisor, new computers, and a head count of the
population. The CBSI currently compiles balance of payments and national accounts data and CBSI
staff attended a regional training course on balance of payments statistics arranged by PFTAC in April
2005.

ANNEX IV

SOLOMON ISLANDS: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
(As of July 2005)
Since becoming a Bank member in June 1978, the Solomon Islands has received eight IDA credits
totaling US$50 million in the infrastructure, education, health, finance, and agriculture sectors.
Following the repayment of all outstanding arrears in September 2003, the Solomon Islands came out
of non-accrual status, and country relations have normalized. The Solomon Islands is eligible for an
IDA 14 allocation of SDR 5.7 million (indicative only) over FY2006-08. In FY06, this will be on a
grant-financed basis with future years subject to annual assessment.
The Bank’s assistance program in the Solomon Islands is guided by the Government’s own
development priorities articulated in the National Economic Reform, Recovery, and Development
Plan (2003-06), and the Bank’s broader Pacific Regional Strategy, which has a focus on two main
pillars: public expenditure management and private sector development. The Bank’s focus for the
Solomon Islands is in the following areas:
•

•

•

•
•
•

•

Health Sector. The IDA-funded (US$4.0 million) Health Sector Development Project
approved in mid-2000 is helping address some of the challenges in the sector through the
strengthening of the reproductive health and malaria programs, the testing of new approaches,
and through improved planning, management and monitoring.
Education Sector. The government has launched a new education strategy and is developing
a sector-wide approach to education planning and financing with support from NZAid and
the EU. The Bank is providing selected policy inputs into this process, drawing on the lessons
of such approaches elsewhere (including in the Pacific).
Energy Supply. The Bank is supporting government’s efforts to improve the efficiency of
the energy sector by providing technical assistance for the financial restructuring of the
Solomon Islands Electricity Authority (SIEA), regulatory reform and capacity building, as
well as to explore options to improve rural access and service delivery in remote areas. It is
expected that this work will expand to include the water utility (Solomon Islands Water
Authority).
Telecommunications Sector. The Bank is providing technical assistance to the Government
to examine ways to improve the competitiveness of the sector to reduce telecommunication
costs and improve the service quality and coverage.
Rural Growth. The Bank is looking to partner with key donors active in the sector to
develop an overall sector strategy and pilot project, to diversify and increase rural incomegenerating opportunities as the basis for stronger and more inclusive growth.
Financial Sector Recovery and Development. The Central Bank Capacity Building Project
with an Institutional Development Fund (IDF) grant of US$ 254,000 has been approved to
support capacity building at the Central Bank. The Bank has also provided technical
assistance and policy advice to the National Provident Fund to strengthen investment
portfolio management.
Foreign and Domestic Investment. The Foreign Investment Advisory Service (FIAS) has
provided assistance to the government for the preparation of new foreign investment
legislation and is assisting with a review of investment incentives and administrative barriers
to business.

ANNEX V

SOLOMON ISLANDS: RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of July 2005)
Since joining the Asian Development Bank (AsDB) in 1973, the Solomon Islands has received
16 loans for a total amount of US$79.3 million, and 57 TA projects for a total amount of
US$13.2 million. The loan and TA projects have been in agriculture and fisheries, transportation,
infrastructure rehabilitation, finance, power, water supply and sanitation, ports, reform of state-owned
enterprises, and institutional development of government ministries and public agencies, particularly
the executing agencies of AsDB-financed projects.
During 1994–97, no new operations were initiated because of government arrears on debt servicing
obligations. In 1998, with the clearance of overdue loan payments to the AsDB, lending and TA
operations resumed. In August 1998, the ADB approved a US$25 million policy-based program loan
and a US$1 million TA loan to support the Government’s Public Sector Reform Program. The first
tranche of the program loan (US$15 million) was disbursed in November 1998. The second tranche
of the loan was not released and was eventually cancelled since, subsequent to the outbreak of ethnic
unrest in mid-1999, a new government did not support the program’s objectives. In 2000, the AsDB
approved a US$10 million post-conflict emergency rehabilitation project loan. However, due to debt
servicing arrears, the AsDB suspended its operational program in the Solomon Islands in February
2002. The AsDB resumed its country operations after the settlement of the arrears in September 2003.
In 2003, one new TA grant was approved for institutional strengthening of the Ministry of
Infrastructure Development; in 2004, two TA grants were approved in support of inter-island
transportation and state-owned enterprise reforms and private sector participation; one TA grant for
interisland transport reform has been approved in 2005, and another one for business environment
reforms is proposed for approval in late 2005. However, in agreement with the Government, the
AsDB will provide no new loans to the country until public finances have stabilized.
The AsDB’s operations in the Solomon Islands are guided by the Pacific Strategy 2005-2009. In
support of the Government's National Economic Recovery, Reform, and Development Plan, the
AsDB will assist the Government in: (i) improving inter-island transportation; (ii) reforming stateowned enterprises; and (iii) providing an enabling environment for the private sector. The AsDB’s
Pacific Liaison and Coordination Office (PLCO), established in early 2005 in Sydney, is responsible
for country programming, project implementation and administration, supported by the Pacific
Operations Division (PAHQ) in Manila.

ANNEX VI

SOLOMON ISLANDS: POVERTY AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT INDICATORS
Social indicators of poverty and human development are low in the Solomon Islands. The country
ranks below all Pacific island countries, except Papua New Guinea and Vanuatu, in the United
Nations Human Development Index, coming in at 124 out of 175 countries. There are few recent
poverty statistics, but anecdotal evidence suggests poverty remains high. However, the more
extreme forms of poverty, such as malnourishment, have remained limited due to an abundant
resource base, assured access to customary land tenure, and resilient social networks. This
advantage is under pressure from a population growth rate that, at about 3 percent a year, is
amongst the highest in the world.
Nonetheless, the Solomon Islands has achieved some progress in improving living conditions since
independence despite falling per capita incomes. Prior to the outbreak of the civil conflict in 1999,
sizable health and education expenditures (at 3–5 percent of GDP each) and high per capita aid
inflows had helped underpin these improvements. Providing widespread and quality education to
the very young population (43 percent under age 15) is a challenge. The primary education
enrollment ratio is about 97 percent, although primary education is not compulsory. The enrollment
ratio is only 30 percent in secondary education. Concerning health, malaria is rampant, with the
highest rate of infection in the world outside of sub-Saharan Africa, and more than a third of the
rural population lacks access to safe water.
The paucity of data makes an assessment of human development trends since 1999 difficult. It is
likely that the positive trend was halted, if not reversed during the years of the civil conflict. Public
service delivery was hampered, and large inter-island migrations put strains on the existing
capacity. While the conflict led to a sharp decline in agricultural production for market (due to the
lack of security and transport services), it has recovered since mid-2003, and anecdotal evidence
suggest that the delivery of pro-poor services is improving.
The aggregate social indicators mask large differences between urban and rural areas. The two main
problems in the rural sector are the lack of essential public services such as health and education,
and cash income due to difficulties in market access for rural products. While the urban areas have
better social services and average incomes are higher, the urban poor face difficulties in securing
employment and land for residence.
The government has adopted the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in its National Economic
Recovery, Reform, and Development Plan, and has committed to monitor progress toward them.
Achieving the MDGs by 2015 is still possible, but remains a major challenge. Progress in some
areas, such as reducing malaria incidence, maternal mortality and ensuring environmental
sustainability, has so far been inadequate.

ANNEX VII

SOLOMON ISLANDS: STATISTICAL ISSUES
The Solomon Islands’ economic and financial database is poor. Data shortcomings significantly limit
the staff’s analysis, particularly for the real, fiscal, and external sectors. Only the Central Bank of the
Solomon Islands (CBSI) regularly provides monetary statistics that are adequate for surveillance
purposes. Overall, the data are barely adequate for surveillance. Although the rebuilding of the
National Statistical Office (NSO) has commenced, the CBSI continues to publish highly summarized
monetary and price data in its Monthly Economic Bulletin and data on all sectors in its Quarterly
Review and Annual Report. There is a Solomon Islands page in the IFS, but significant updating
delays occur.
Real sector statistics
The NSO has not produced national accounts data since 1994. The task of preparing GDP estimates
was taken over by the CBSI, but its annual estimates build on a limited amount of source data
(primarily commodity exports and employment estimates) and no breakdown of GDP by expenditure
categories is provided. Data on production of major export commodities are reported on a monthly
basis. Limited data on employment can be obtained from the National Provident Fund, while wage
data are not produced. The NSO reclaimed the task of producing the CPI (which currently applies
only to Honiara) from the CBSI in August 2003, but the weights are outdated.
Monetary and financial statistics
Monetary statistics are compiled by the CBSI on a monthly basis and summary data are published in
the Monthly Economic Bulletin, while more detailed data are published in the Quarterly Review and
Annual Report. The monetary and financial statistics provided to the Fund are considered adequate
for surveillance purposes. Prior to the civil conflict, monetary statistics were reported to the Fund’s
Statistics Department with a four-week lag. Over the past several years, however, direct reporting to
STA by the CBSI was suspended (monetary statistics obtained from APD continued to be published
in the IFS). Recently, the CBSI has resumed direct reporting to STA, but it fails to utilize the
standardized report forms (SRFs) for reporting monetary statistics to the IMF, introduced in October
2004.
Government finance statistics
The Ministry of Finance (MOF) started disseminating monthly press releases on budget realizations
in August 2003. However, expenditure and financing data provided by the MOF are not consistent
with GFS methodology, and the reliability of historical data is doubtful given the breakdown of
accounting mechanisms and large expenditure arrears accrued during the crisis. Separate data for the
provincial government finances are not available and financial data for state enterprises have not
been compiled for several years. With the exception of direct budget support, the authorities do not
collect information on disbursements of grants or grant-financed development spending. The
installation of the Commonwealth Secretariat Debt Recording and Management System (CS-DRMS)
database in the CBSI and MOF in March has improved the quality of official debt data. The MOF

- 47 -

ANNEX VII

has not reported annual GFS data for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook
(GFSY).
External sector statistics
Partial quarterly balance of payments data are estimated by the CBSI on the basis of cash foreign
exchange transactions reported through the banking system and are available with a three-month lag.
In the absence of supplementary surveys (e.g., on foreign direct investment and aid inflows), such
data are deficient in both detail and coverage.
Remedial Measures
The NSO is being rehabilitated, and is gradually resuming data collection and publication
responsibilities. A PFTAC GDDS mission in February 2004 concluded that rebuilding the statistical
system will require extensive TA over at least two years and external funding. Following its
recommendations, a new government statistician was appointed in 2004 and a long-term adviser—
funded by AusAid and NZAid—took up his post in April 2005.
The NSO is currently conducting a business survey and has commenced preparation for a household
income and expenditure survey (HIES), expected to take place over a six month period beginning in
October 2005. The HIES results will then be used to construct new bases for the national accounts
and the CPI weights. Work on producing 2005 national accounts estimates is expected to commence
in April-May 2006. The NSO has started work on a construction price index, and following the
HIES, plans to prepare national headline and underlying CPIs. A population census is planned for
late 2009, with preparations expected to commence in 2007.
The PFTAC GDDS mission identified a number of other statistical issues that still require attention,
including increasing the response rate to balance of payments surveys in order to reduce reliance on
foreign exchange transaction records, and resuming use of customs data for the estimation of imports
and exports. The PC Trade software, scheduled to be installed at the Customs Division in 2006, will
make it easier for the NSO to make use of customs data to prepare trade estimates. Nonetheless, the
NSO should soon be in a position to produce export and import value estimates based on customs
data, with volume estimates to follow. The NSO continues to be hampered by weak technological
skills amongst its staff and low survey response rates, which it is seeking to address through tougher
penalties under the Statistics Act. The NSO has prepared a prototype of government finance statistics
tables based on recurrent revenue and expenditure data provided by the Ministry of Finance.
However, this work in progress is still very preliminary, and is hampered by the dearth of aid and
development spending information. Audits of state enterprise accounts are currently underway and,
once completed, should provide a better picture of public sector finances. PFTAC is planning to
provide technical assistance to the NSO in the area of government finance statistics compilation.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation with the
Solomon Islands
On September 28, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with the Solomon Islands.1
Background
The recovery, which began after the arrival of Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon
Islands (RAMSI) in mid-2003, has continued. With the restoration of law and order and
extensive donor assistance, in the last two years the economy registered positive per capita
growth, lower inflation, improved public finances, and a stronger external position. International
reserves have been rebuilt to comfortable levels.
After several years of underperformance, the Solomon Islands’ growth in the past three years
has been about 2½ percentage points above the Pacific Island Countries’ average.
Boosted by logging, real GDP growth was 5½ percent in 2004 for the second year running.
In 2005, although nonlogging growth should accelerate due to the pickup in investment and
significant fiscal stimulus, absent a net contribution from logging, growth is projected to
moderate to 4½ percent. Inflation rose to 7.8 percent in 2004 due to increased nontradable
demand by expatriates and rising fuel prices, and is projected to be broadly unchanged this
year, due to the continued pass-through of persistently high oil prices and the pickup in
economic activity.
The central government recorded a large surplus of 8¼ percent of GDP in 2004 due to
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2higher budget support grants, improved tax collection, eliminating militia payments, tighter
expenditure controls, and limited spending capacity. Despite further revenue gains, a small
deficit (½ percent of GDP) is projected in 2005, as capacity and the wage bill rise and budget
support falls. About half of the deterioration between 2004 and 2005 is due to exceptional
factors, primarily Australia’s withdrawal of budget support, one-off revenue from a tax amnesty
and payment of back taxes in 2004, and one-off civil servants bonus this year.
The external position improved markedly in 2004. The current account recorded a surplus of
12½ percent of GDP, owing to a strong recovery of both timber and other primary commodity
exports, low imports, and an almost doubling of current transfers. Net international reserves
(NIR) rose to US$76 million, equivalent to 5½ months of 2005 projected imports. In 2005, the
current account is projected to post a large deficit, mainly
due to the high import content of investment projects, but also to a rising oil import bill and
recovery from a low import base. Despite the wide current account deficit projected for 2005,
with development grants expected to be strong and FDI to rise considerably, NIR are projected
to decline only marginally.
Soaring net foreign assets at the central bank led to a 74 percent rise in reserve money in
2004. However, a large buildup of banks’ excess reserves prevented strong money growth
from translating into high inflation. Banks’ caution limited real private credit growth to
2.5 percent and resulted in banks accumulating excess reserves equivalent to 39 percent of
deposits. Real private credit growth rose to 21 percent year-on-year in May 2005, as banks’
excess reserves dropped to 32 percent of deposits.
Although macroeconomic stability has been maintained, progress on structural reforms
has been mixed. In the fiscal area, tax administration has improved, and the government
has started work on a medium-term fiscal framework. In the structural area, work has
started on a wide range of reforms, but progress, especially on the legislative front, has
been slow, mainly because attaining reform buy-in has required extensive consultations.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the continued recovery of the Solomon Islands’ economy and
the maintenance of macroeconomic stability. Inflation is expected to remain in single digits;
strong commodity exports and substantial aid flows have strengthened the external position;
and reserve coverage is comfortable. Directors commended the authorities for these
improvements, but noted that the country still faces difficult challenges that will require
sustained policy efforts in the coming years. Logging is expected to decline from its current
unsustainable level over the medium term and unless growth in other sectors picks up, living
standards will likely fall. Against this background, Directors urged the authorities to set
macroeconomic policies with a longer-term horizon, embrace fiscal reform to make room for
social and infrastructure-related spending without jeopardizing fiscal sustainability, and step up
the pace of structural reform to promote private sector development.
Directors commended the authorities for the marked improvement in the fiscal position in 2004
and welcomed the increased focus of spending on priority sectors in the 2005 Budget. At the
same time, spending plans should take into account the country’s still limited absorptive
capacity, and the authorities were advised to save any revenue overperformance and
underspending to keep this year’s deficit below budget. Going forward, Directors stressed the

-3need for continued fiscal consolidation, given limited financing sources and the need to reduce
the high level of public debt. In this connection, they emphasized the importance of
implementing a medium-term fiscal framework, and urged the authorities to adopt a combinedsource budget that would include all aid flows.
Directors agreed that further rationalization and tighter controls over expenditure, in particular
the wage bill, are needed in order to help reorient spending toward primary education and
health, infrastructure, and maintenance. Progress over the medium term will require a broad
based reform of the civil service. Directors welcomed the authorities’ proposed tax reform to
bolster domestic revenue in the face of declining import and logging duties and encouraged
continued efforts to strengthen tax administration. They also urged the authorities to reduce
the scope of tax exemptions. Directors considered that fiscal decentralization should be
preceded by a strengthening of the public finances and of administrative capacity and should
not be allowed to weaken fiscal discipline. Given that the Solomon Islands debt situation will
remain fragile even if sound policies are implemented, Directors welcomed the authorities’
plans to normalize relations with creditors, and, in this context, emphasized the importance of
tackling arrears.
Directors considered that the policy of stabilizing the exchange rate in the face of strong
foreign inflows, which has been in place since early 2003, remains appropriate at the current
juncture. Looking ahead, they agreed that it will be important to avoid intervention in the face
of possible downward pressures on the exchange rate, and a few Directors also suggested
keeping under review the possibility of allowing some appreciation if warranted. Directors
noted that continued strong foreign inflows, a drawdown of government deposits, and the
acceleration in private credit growth could pose challenges for the conduct of monetary policy.
They called on the central bank to continue to develop further its instruments of monetary
policy, and to stand ready to rein in credit growth in the face of inflationary pressures.
Directors noted that the banking system of the Solomon Islands is generally sound, although
the pick up in credit growth will require strong risk management practices by banks. Directors
expressed concern about the continued poor profitability of the National Provident Fund (NPF)
and the associated fiscal risks. In this context, they welcomed the authorities’ efforts to
introduce greater transparency in the NPF’s operations and their initiative to improve its
governance, including through the planned legislation. Directors also recommended that the
troubled Development Bank of the Solomon Islands be liquidated. They welcomed the
amended anti-money laundering (AML) Act and the steps being taken to combat money
laundering and the financing of terrorism.
Directors underscored that a strengthened commitment to wide-ranging structural reforms will
be key to creating an enabling business environment for private sector development, and
mitigate the impact of declining logging activity on growth over the medium term. In this
context, the passage of the foreign investment bill and significant efforts to streamline
regulation and licensing procedures will send a positive signal to investors and donors. It will
also be important to deepen state-owned enterprise reform and strengthen the regulatory
environment for utilities in order to improve service delivery and reduce fiscal risks. Directors
also highlighted the critical importance of better governance and stronger institutions, including
an efficient civil service, to enhance confidence, promote a level playing field for private sector
activity, and ensure the effective management of aid flows.

-4Directors noted that several shortcomings of the statistical database continue to hamper
surveillance. While welcoming the remedial efforts that are currently under way, they urged the
authorities to step up efforts to improve the reliability, coverage, and timeliness of data, which
will enable the authorities to strengthen economic analysis and policymaking.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.
