STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
June 25, 2014

KEY ISSUES
Setting: Swaziland has gradually recovered from the fiscal crisis of 2010−11, buoyed by
the improved revenues from the Southern African Customs Union (SACU). Growth
modestly recovered, and international reserves rebounded. Swaziland’s challenges,
however, remain significant, in view of its high vulnerability to exogenous shocks and its
sluggish growth performance, while facing significant social and development
challenges with high unemployment and the prevalence of HIV/AIDS. Swaziland now
stands at a critical juncture to strengthen its resilience to exogenous shocks, address its
weak growth performance, and meet critical social and development needs.
Outlook and risks: Under the status-quo policies, the outlook is for continued sluggish
growth and increasing fiscal and external imbalances, reflecting low private investment,
elevated government spending, and prospective decline in SACU revenues. Risks are
associated with the high volatility of the SACU revenues, possible negative spillovers
from South Africa (including higher policy rate and lower growth), and uncertain
prospects for preferential trade agreements with the U.S. and EU.
Strengthening Resilience to Shocks: Over the medium term, international reserves
should be targeted at five to seven months of imports, and public debt be kept below
30 percent of GDP. This calls for a prudent fiscal policy stance, with fiscal deficit below
2 percent of GDP.
Raising growth: It is essential to enhance the efficiency of the public sector and
promote private sector-led growth through structural reforms including improving
business climate and accelerating land reforms.
Maintaining financial stability: Financial soundness indicators are generally strong. The
strong growth of the nonbank financial sector in recent years calls for strengthening of
supervision and regulation for the sector.
Past advice: There is broad agreement between the Fund and the authorities on
macroeconomic policy and structural reform priorities. With the authorities’ fiscal
consolidation efforts and the improved SACU revenues, fiscal and external sustainability
is being restored, consistent with staff’s advice. However, progress on structural
reforms—including re-launching the privatization process, improving access to modern
finance and improving the business climate—has been modest.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK, AND RISKS
A. Recent Economic Developments
1.
Swaziland’s economic performance has improved since the fiscal crisis of 2010–11,
underpinned by the recovery of revenues from the Southern African Customs Union (SACU).
Driven mainly by communication, manufacturing, and construction (as a result of large capital
spending), real GDP growth in 2013 is estimated at 2¾ percent, recovering from ‒½ percent in
2011. Several indicators suggest the return of business confidence; commercial bank credit to the
private sector is growing strongly, and the risk premium on T-bills continues to decline (Figure 1).
Meanwhile, inflation has slightly risen, reaching 5.3 percent in April 2014, owing to increases in food
and some administered prices (e.g., electricity and fuel).
2.
Improved SACU revenue since
2012/13 reduced the pressure on fiscal and
external balances. The SACU revenue recovered
from about 9 percent of GDP in 2010/112011/12 to over 18–20 percent of GDP since
2012/13.

The external current account turned from a deficit of 8¼ percent of GDP in 2011 to a surplus
of 3¾ percent in 2012 and is estimated to have reached a surplus of 6 percent in 2013. This
outcome was driven mainly by an increase in the SACU revenue and robust growth in
exports (e.g., coal and iron ore). International reserves have reached 3¾ months of imports
by March 2014, recovering from the low level of 2 months at end-March 2012.

Staff analysis suggests that Swaziland’s real effective exchange rate is moderately
overvalued.1 The lilangeni has depreciated in real effective terms in line with the South African rand
since 2011. While different estimation approaches give mixed results, the overall assessment points
to a moderate overvaluation (Appendix 1).2
4.
According to the financial sector soundness indicators, commercial banks are generally
sound and liquid, and their asset quality has recently improved (Table 9), while financial
system risks remain in nonbank financial institutions (NBFI). The banking sector appears well
capitalized, with the capital adequacy ratio of the banks reaching 24 percent of risk-weighted assets.

B. Development and Social Challenges
5.
Swaziland continues to face serious development challenges, including high
unemployment, poverty, and the prevalence of HIV/AIDS (Figure 2). Unemployment (particularly
for youth) stays high.4 The high prevalence of HIV/AIDS (at about 26 percent for adults aged 15–49)
has significantly lowered life expectancy (UNAIDS, 2012). Although there has been some progress in

The analysis is based on the status quo scenario.

2
Swaziland continues to maintain an exchange restriction subject to Fund approval under Article VIII arising from a
50 percent limit on the provision for advance payments for the import of capital goods in excess of 10 million
emalangeni.
3

The authorities are taking steps to strengthen the surveillance of NBFIs. Large SACCOs are being assessed, and the
rest is expected to be also assessed soon. Based on technical assistance from the IMF, the authorities plan to
strengthen the regulatory and supervisory frameworks for NBFIs as well as building capacity for both off-site and onsite supervision.
4

The overall unemployment rate stood at 28.5 percent in 2010, while the youth unemployment reached 52.4 percent.
No newer figures are available, but indications are that unemployment stays high.

poverty reduction, an estimated 63 percent of the population still lives below the national poverty
line in 2010 (down from 69 percent in 2001). This level is generally higher than other countries at the
same income level (Figure 2), suggesting that there is room to enhance the inclusiveness of growth.
6.
Protracted weak growth performance contributed to the lack of progress in social
developments. Though growth rebounded after the crisis, Swaziland has long suffered from
sluggish growth performance, with average real GDP growth over 2004–13 at about two percent per
year. This modest growth—less than half of the level of its neighboring countries (Botswana,
Lesotho, and Namibia)—is also associated with high unemployment and limited progress in social
developments (with widespread poverty and high inequality).
7.
The new government has indicated its intention to address significant social and
development challenges. Following parliamentary elections in September 2013, a new
administration was formed. The prime minister was reappointed, and the minister of finance and the
central bank governor switched their posts.5 The new minister of finance stated in his 2014/15
budget speech that the government would focus on invigorating economic growth, creating
employment opportunities, and accelerating public sector reforms.

C. Outlook and Risks
8.
Based on status-quo policies (baseline scenario), sluggish growth performance is
expected to continue, while Swaziland would remain vulnerable to exogenous shocks. In the
near term, growth is expected to remain low (at about 2 percent per annum), reflecting low private
sector investment. Furthermore, the prospective decline in the SACU revenue and increases in public
sector wages—as envisaged under the government’s medium-term fiscal framework—would
translate into large fiscal deficits and external imbalances.6 With potential crowding out of the credit
to the private sector (owing to large financing needs of the government), growth would gradually
decline to below 2 percent over the medium term. Capital inflows would remain low, international
reserves would fall to 3 months of imports, and the debt-to-GDP ratio would steadily increase to
30 percent. Should SACU revenues fall significantly (as in 2010–11), its impact on the economy could
be even larger (compared with the previous crisis), given that Swaziland would be less resilient to
the shocks owing to reduced policy space.

5

Swaziland is a monarchy, where the King holds the executive authority, which may be exercised either directly or
through the Cabinet or a Minister. Parliamentary elections are held every five years, following which the King
appoints cabinet members, 20 out of 30 senators, and 10 out of 65 members of the lower house.
6

The SACU revenues will remain high in 2014/15 (19 percent of GDP), but medium-term prospects are uncertain. The
authorities expect that the revenue would stabilize around their historical average of 17 percent of GDP.

The main near-term risks are associated with the uncertain external environment
(developments in South Africa, in particular) and the high volatility of the SACU revenue
(see the risk assessment matrix (RAM)). The Central Bank of Swaziland (CBS) would have to raise
its discount rate if the South African Reserve Bank hikes its policy rate further (as expected by the
market). If South Africa’s growth weakens and/or international capital flows to South Africa
significantly decline, adverse outward spillovers from the country may rise—possibly channeled
through lower SACU revenue and trade and financial flows. Furthermore, uncertain prospects for the
fate of preferential trade agreements—the Economic Partnership Agreements (EPA) with the EU and
the African Growth and Opportunities Act (AGOA) with the U.S.—would affect production and
investment in the textile and sugar sectors.7,8

7

During Swaziland’s annual review for AGOA eligibility in December 2013, the U.S. Government determined that
Swaziland failed to satisfy the AGOA eligibility requirements due to violations of worker rights. Though the deadline
was extended to May 15, 2014 for the Swaziland Government to satisfy five conditions, Swaziland failed to satisfy
these conditions. The authorities are currently making efforts to meet the conditions by end-year, with a view to
renewing the AGOA eligibility. Should Swaziland lose its eligibility from 2015, although the trade and growth impacts
would likely be moderate (the GDP share of textile industry is about 3 percent), it could have large employment and
social impacts.
8

The EU and the Africa, the Caribbean, and the Pacific Group of States (ACP) are committed to signing EPAs between
the EU and regional groups of ACP countries, rather than bilaterally. While the current interim EPA is set to expire in
October 2014, Swaziland is currently negotiating the EPA as part of the Southern African Development Community
(SADC) group. Swaziland largely benefits from the EPA for its sugar exports to the EU (accounting for about half of
its sugar exports and 9 percent of the total exports). A loss of preferential access to the EU market could have large

Enhanced reform efforts, combined with prudent fiscal policy, would improve
Swaziland’s growth potential and strengthen its resilience to shocks. The reform scenario
envisages structural reforms to stimulate private sector-led growth and a prudent fiscal policy (with
the fiscal deficits of less than 2 percent of GDP over the medium-term) to secure fiscal and external
sustainability. The impacts of enhanced revenue mobilization efforts are cautiously estimated under
this scenario, which implies possible room for further adjustment by greater revenue mobilization (in
case the risk of a SACU revenue fall should materialize). Current account balance would be stronger
than the baseline scenario, and capital inflows would be higher. International reserves would exceed
five months of imports over the medium term, and public debt would remain below 25 percent of
GDP. Swaziland would be then better positioned to cope with another SACU revenue shock.
Increased capital spending (e.g., to meet critical infrastructure needs), following through project
appraisal and selection, would help to raise Swaziland’s growth potential. Furthermore, with
enhanced efforts to improve business climate and financial intermediation, private investment is
expected to increase, and GDP growth would reach 4 percent.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
While Swaziland has been recovering from two years of fiscal crisis (2010–2011), it remains highly
vulnerable to exogenous shocks. Furthermore, Swaziland continues to face serious development
impact on Swaziland’s exports and the economy. Protracted slower growth in Europe would also adversely affect
Swaziland’s sugar exports.

challenges, with weak growth performance, high unemployment and prevalence of HIV/AIDS.
Swaziland now stands at a critical juncture to (i) strengthen its resilience to exogenous shocks, while
meeting critical social and development needs, and (ii) address its sluggish growth performance and
promote inclusive growth.

A. Strengthening Resilience to Exogenous Shocks
Building cushion to respond to shocks
11.
The experience of the 2010‒11 fiscal
crisis underlines Swaziland’s high vulnerability
to shocks because of its heavy reliance on the
highly volatile SACU revenue. The significant fall
in the SACU revenue (by 10 percent of GDP) during
the crisis led to large fiscal and current account
deficits. Since the authorities’ consolidation efforts
(largely through reduced capital spending) could
not fully accommodate the shock, they ran large
fiscal deficits in 2010–11, with financing from the
drawdown of government deposits and
accumulation of debt, which eventually led to a
decline in international reserves.

the economy’s resilience to exogenous shocks,
through securing a sufficient international reserve cushion and maintaining debt
sustainability.


To respond to exogenous shocks (such as a significant fall in the SACU revenue),
international reserves should be further increased to five to seven months of imports over
the medium-term (Appendix 2). Though this reserve target may stand at the higher end of
traditional reserves adequacy estimates, this level of reserves should be secured, in light of
Swaziland’s high vulnerability to shocks, as reflected by the severity of the recent crisis
experience.9



Public debt should be maintained below 30 percent of GDP, to create sufficient buffer to
address future shocks. Though the public debt stood at a modest level (17.2 percent of GDP)
at end–2013, gross financing needs stay high (Appendix 3). To ensure debt sustainability, a
prudent fiscal policy, together with debt management strategies, should be implemented.

9

International reserves stood at 4 months of imports, or 24 percent of GDP at end–2009. Yet, the government had to
cut spending markedly during 2010‒11 when the SACU revenues declined substantially, and reserve coverage
dropped to 2.3 months of imports at the end of 2011.

The strategy should incorporate the debt from public enterprises and all relevant risks.
Specifically, the projected increase in gross financing needs is a source of concern, as it
could raise interest rate and rollover risks; with possible financing constraints due to the
small size of Swaziland’s financial sector.
13.
The authorities concurred with staff on the need to strengthen resilience to shocks, by
building sufficient international reserves and maintaining modest debt distress.
On international reserves, the authorities agreed with the proposed level of 5–7 months of imports,
noting that it is in line with CBS’s internal target of 6 months as set under the Southern African
Development Community (SADC)’s macroeconomic convergence criteria. On debt limit, they broadly
agreed with staff’s assessment, while setting 35 percent of GDP as the absolute ceiling of public
debt. Taking into account the potential rollover risks, they expressed their intention to take
advantage of the current favorable domestic liquidity conditions to better manage the term
structure of financing.
Maintaining a prudent fiscal stance, while meeting critical social and development needs
14.
Given the desirability of maintaining the exchange rate peg (to maintain price stability
and facilitate capital and current transactions with South Africa), Swaziland will have to rely
on fiscal adjustment and structural reforms to accumulate international reserves. Following
two consecutive years of the fiscal surplus, the 2014/15 fiscal framework envisages an overall deficit
of 1 percent of GDP. Over the medium-term, however, the deficits are expected to increase to
5 percent of GDP, owing to the prospective decline in SACU revenue, the scheduled review of public
sector wages, and planned increase in capital spending.10, 11 In light of already high public sector
wages (the compensation of employees increased from 10 percent of GDP in 2000/01 to
14¼ percent in 2013/14), the minister alerted in his budget speech that “the level of government’s
wage bill has reached unsustainable levels”.

Staff pointed to the importance of maintaining a prudent fiscal target (to secure a
sufficient buffer for shocks), while safeguarding critical social spending and growthpromoting capital expenditures.12 With the increasing spending pressures and a prospective
decline in the SACU revenue over the medium term, Swaziland’s international reserves would stay
significantly below the adequate level. A prudent fiscal policy stance is necessary going forward,
with a fiscal deficit ceiling of 2 percent of GDP over the medium term, to help maintain adequate
international reserves and ensure debt sustainability. To achieve the target, the following policy
measures are called for:


Improving revenue administration. The Swaziland Revenue Authority (SRA) should continue
to expand taxpayer’s registration, increase compliance and service delivery, enhance selfassessment, and strengthen VAT collections. Furthermore, the cost of tax exemptions should
be reassessed to eliminate those whose benefits are not commensurate to the cost.



Rationalizing recurrent expenditures (focusing on spending on goods and services and
compensation of employees). The authorities should identify possible savings in non-priority
spending, while safeguarding critical social expenditures. Recent increases in compensation
of employees, as well as the scheduled salary review, raise a concern as they could squeeze
out critical social and capital expenditures (Box 1). To this end, the staff shared the minister’s
concern about the level of government’s wage bill and argued that, to contain further
increase, public sector wage bills should be kept constant in real terms (e.g., by containing



Effectively implementing planned public sector reforms (including the payroll and skill audits).
To contain the wage bills, the staff supported the government’s plan for public sector
reforms (including payroll audits and the staff inspection function). These reforms should be
implemented promptly and effectively, if needed, with technical assistance by Swaziland’s
international partners.



Strengthening public financial management (PFM). The enactment and effective
implementation of the PFM Bill are critical to strengthen PFM and macroeconomic analysis.
Furthermore, in line with the authorities’ PFM action plan, key reform measures include
(i) preparing a coherent medium-term fiscal and expenditure framework; (ii) improving cash
management; and (iii) strengthening commitment control to prevent arrears.13 It is important
to enhance fiscal reporting and transparency (posting the budget outturn on the website is a
good step forward), while effectively addressing the issues identified in the auditor general’s
reports.14 Reconciliation exercises should also be conducted on regular basis. Furthermore,

13

To assist the rationalization process, a set of spending reviews (driven by a medium term expenditure
framework)—with ranking key priority policies and service delivery outcomes and outputs, and identifying
opportunities for prioritizing resource allocation and reducing manpower costs—should be undertaken.

The 2012/13 Auditor General’s report found that the consolidated financial statements did not present fairly the
financial position of the government. The report specifically identified: i) the lack of working relations between the
Internal Audit and Auditor General’s office, ii) failure to submit audited financial statements by 14 out of 39 public

critical social and development spending.
They affirmed their intention to maintain a prudent fiscal policy, noting that the fiscal deficit ceiling
of 2 percent of GDP would be achievable, while safeguarding critical social and development
spending. They therefore expected that fiscal outcome would turn out to be better than envisaged
in the current medium-term fiscal framework. Nevertheless, they saw the upcoming review of public
sector wages as a challenge. Such spending pressures are expected to be partially offset by the
ongoing efforts for public sector reforms (in particular through payroll audits). As part of the effort
to strengthen PFM, the authorities planned to implement the PFM action plan more rigorously, with

Box 1. Public Sector Wage Increases and Planned Public Sector Reforms
Swaziland’s public wage bill has steadily increased over
the last three decades, reaching 14 percent of GDP in
2013/14. This level is exceptionally high among SubSaharan African countries. The wage bill accounts for
about 40 percent of total expenditures, limiting fiscal
policy flexibility. Thus, fiscal consolidation was often
conducted by significantly reducing capital expenditures
(as in 2010–11).

(Percent of GDP)

The increase in nominal wage bill is largely explained by
the increase in the average per head wage (largely as a
result of periodic salary reviews, cost of living
adjustments, and notch increases) and the increasing
number of government employees. For the last ten
years, the total wage bill expanded by 176 percent, while
the per head wage increased by 116 percent. The pace
of increase in the per head wage far exceeded inflation,
and even higher than nominal GDP per capita.

17.
In view of the high volatility and uncertainty of the SACU revenue, a fiscal framework
to better manage this uncertainty is worth exploring. The authorities are exploring the option of
implementing a revenue rule that would only incorporate into the budget their estimated steady
state level of SACU revenue (17 percent of GDP, the historical average) with any additional SACU
revenue saved in a stabilization fund (to be used when the revenue is lower than the average).


In the staff’s view, a credible fiscal rule could help ensure fiscal and external sustainability
and mitigate the adverse impacts of exogenous shocks on the economy. For the rule to be
successful, however, it would be important to complete the groundwork before its
introduction (Box 2). Specifically such a framework (i) would require strong PFM (e.g., fiscal
monitoring, transparency, internal and external audit) and (ii) should be compatible with a
sustainable macroeconomic framework. In terms of a stabilization fund, it would be
important to (i) ensure its full transparency and accountability and (ii) implement strict
regulation/rule for its use.



The authorities expressed their intention to carefully explore such a framework; initially by
anchoring the fiscal policy with a medium-term international reserve target of 5‒7 months of
imports, while exploring a fiscal rule or a stabilization fund with enhancing efforts to
strengthen PFM or complete the groundwork, assisted by the IMF technical assistance.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KINGDOM OF SWAZILAND

Box 2. Groundwork for Successful Fiscal Rules
Following the fiscal crisis, the authorities are exploring different fiscal policy frameworks to better manage the
high volatility of SACU revenue. Specifically, they envisage a revenue rule that would only incorporate into the
budget their estimated steady state level of SACU revenue of 17 percent of GDP (the historical average) with
any additional SACU revenue saved in a stabilization fund.
A fiscal rule is worth considering, in view of successful experiences in some resource-rich countries with
similar challenges to manage highly volatile revenues.1 A credible fiscal rule could help to manage the high
volatility of SACU revenue. The staff’s preliminary analysis suggests that, compared with the status quo, a
fiscal rule which targets a non-SACU fiscal deficit of 17 percent (similar in spirit with the authorities’ plan), if
implemented effectively, may work better to ensure fiscal and external sustainability and mitigate the adverse
impacts of exogenous shocks on growth.2
If a non-SACU deficit target of 17 percent of GDP
had been introduced in 2008/09, expenditures would
have been more stable...

…leading to additional saving before the crisis and allowing
higher spending during the crisis .Cumulative fiscal
imbalances would be mitigated over the medium term.

For a fiscal rule to work effectively, however, adequate PFM systems are prerequisites.3 Specifically it is
important to have: (1) reliable data as well as a minimum technical forecasting capacity (to predict budgetary
aggregates with sufficient accuracy); (2) comprehensive budget reporting systems (to produce in-year and
timely end-year reports); (3) effective internal and external audit systems (to ensure that public resource
utilization is fully accounted for); and (4) publication of fiscal data (to allow external monitoring of the rule).
The stabilization fund—which may be seen as a convenient way to set aside surges in revenues— would also
call for strong PFM. In particular it is important to (i) create the fund within the budget; (ii) ensure its full
transparency and accountability, and (iii) implement strict regulation/rule for its use.

B. Raising Growth Potential and Creating Jobs
18.
The weak growth performance for the last decade has been associated with low
private sector developments and the apparent low growth impact of fiscal spending. This weak
growth performance, particularly with low private sector development, is also associated with high
unemployment and limited progress in poverty reduction.


In the past decades, the government pursued expansionary fiscal policies, while trend
growth has continually decelerated. The government increased spending from about
18 percent of GDP in 1980s to 32 percent in 2000s, though growth averaged about
8 percent in the early 1980s and thereafter it has continually decreased to about 2 percent
for the last ten years. Furthermore, the increasing number of public enterprises (from 28 in
2007 to 45 in 2014) raises concerns on public sector efficiency and the lack of
competitiveness.



Private sector development has been depressed, as shown by the slow pace of capital
accumulation (Figure 4). While middle-income countries and sub-Saharan countries have
gradually increased their fixed capital formation since 2000, Swaziland experienced a sharp
decline in investment, reaching less than half the level (in terms of GDP) from the early
2000s. This is caused by a significant decline in private-sector investment, suggesting the
stagnation of the sector over a long period. There have also been little new FDI inflows in
recent years. There is a risk that Swaziland may be trapped in a “vicious cycle,” with sluggish
growth prospects leading to low private investment (which adversely affects productivity
growth and industrial diversification) and this further reducing the growth potential.



Financial intermediation has been contained. Though commercial banks’ credit to the
private sector is recently growing, its level (relative to GDP) is still relatively low, compared
with other countries in the region. The nonbanking sector (mainly pension and insurance

19.
The authorities expressed concerns about the weak growth performance, although
their previous efforts, through several strategies, have thus far not been fruitful. The Economic
Recovery Strategy (ERS), for example, rightly identified several structural weaknesses (including
unfavorable business environment and low efficiency in public expenditure) as constraints to growth
and laid out a set of measures to address them. Nevertheless, growth has remained well below the
ERS’s target of “at least 5 percent”. Notwithstanding some progress under these strategies, the
implementation of reform has been generally slow. The new minister of finance stated in his
2014/15 budget speech that the government would focus on invigorating economic growth,
creating employment opportunities, and accelerating public sector reforms.
20.
Staff highlighted the needs to address sluggish growth performance, through effective
implementation of structural policy measures. To raise potential growth (and then to enhance
employment and reduce poverty and inequality), it is essential to improve the efficiency of the
public sector and promote private sector-led, inclusive growth, through wide-ranging structural
reforms.16 Improvement in Swaziland’s competitiveness, through these reforms, is also called for,
given an appreciated real exchange rate.


Improve the efficiency of public spending (Appendix 4). To raise the growth impact of public
spending, it is essential to strengthen PFM and public investment management (e.g., project
appraisal and evaluation), introduce program-based budgeting (with implementing a
program classification as a first step), and allocate higher weight to capital expenditures.
Improved efficiency of public spending could also lead to creating fiscal space for critical
social spending and investment to promote inclusive growth. Expenditures for such fiscal
space, following careful assessments (e.g., MTEF-driven spending reviews, project appraisals),
should focus on the areas to help achieve the government’s objectives of promoting growth
and creating jobs. Furthermore, in light of the recent pace of increase in public enterprises,
staff also pointed to the need to review the status of public enterprises and revisit the
Privatization Road Map.17

16

To raise growth, the World Bank suggested the following policy measures in its recent report (“Institutions,
Governance and Growth: Identifying Constraints to Growth in Swaziland”): (i) enhancing the business environment
(e.g., by improving and standardizing time period and procedures for company registration and ameliorating investor
protection); (ii) enhancing public sector efficiency (e.g., by controlling recurrent expenditures and the public wage bill,
increasing the efficiency and performance of public enterprises, providing more predictable and transparent
regulatory systems, and accelerating the pace of implementation of reforms); and (iii) implementing the land reform
(e.g., by assessing the current land management framework and building consensus around a unifying vision of land
governance —a first step already identified in the Draft Land Policy of 2009, alleviating coordination problems faced
by smallholders and providing better enforcement and dispute resolution mechanisms for commercial investors).
17

Based on the Privatization Policy (approved by cabinet in 2006), the privatization roadmap was formulated in 2007,
which, however, has not been fully implemented.

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KINGDOM OF SWAZILAND



Promote private sector developments (Appendix 5). Staff suggests the authorities’ to
(i) accelerate the improvement of the business climate (e.g., on starting a business and
enforcing contracts), (ii) accelerate planned land management reforms (e.g., to finalize and
implement the draft Land Policy), and (iii) strengthen anti-corruption efforts, including by
mobilizing the anti-money laundering framework. Effective implementation of a set of
comprehensive structural measures is called for to break the vicious circle of sluggish growth
and low private investment. Private sector-led growth, with these structural reforms, would
benefit broad segments of the population, helping to reduce inequality and enhance
employment.



Enhance financial intermediation with proper regulatory oversight. To facilitate private sector
development, the staff also argued for further enhancement of financial intermediation
(particularly for the access to credit by small and medium enterprises), while ensuring
financial sector stability. To this end, the staff also advised the Financial Services Regulatory
Authority (FSRA) to further step up its efforts to strengthen the supervision and regulation
for nonbank financial institutions (including the implementations of legal frameworks for the
regulations for insurance companies and capital market institutions).18 Despite the relatively
small size of the SACCOs (with the total asset accounting for 1½ percent of the total
financial sector assets), strengthening supervision and regulation of the sector is important
to ensure confidence in the financial sector. Furthermore, as some of the pension funds and
insurance companies are granting loans, close monitoring of their risks associated with such
activities (e.g., credit risk) is also warranted.

21.
The authorities, recognizing these challenges, generally agreed with the staff’s
suggestions. Acknowledging the importance of efficient and effective public spending, they plan to
(i) further develop internal audit to eliminate wastage and corruption and (ii) to introduce
performance budgeting. To ensure progress in improving business climate, the government has relaunched the Investor Roadmap in 2012. In terms of privatization, the authorities explained that the
increase in public enterprises reflects the needs to establish regulatory authorities for some
industries, while agreeing to revisit the privatization policy and the rationalization of current public
enterprises. On financial intermediation, the authorities acknowledged that there was room to
enhance the access to credit, particularly for small and medium enterprises. To this end, they
expected their current efforts (to formulate a financial sector strategy, with technical assistance from
the IMF and the World Bank) to help enhance financial sector developments and access to credit.
The authorities, however, expressed difficulty in undertaking land reforms pending wider
consultations, largely due to the complexity of the land management issues. In terms of nonbank
financial institutions (specifically SACCOs), the authorities acknowledged the needs to strengthen
18

The FSRA Act came into force in June 2010. It is now operational with the appointment of key staffs and the
issuance of a set of core regulations. Most of the Savings and Credit Cooperatives (SACCOs) have been licensed, and
large SACCOs are being assessed, with corrective actions being taken, based on recommendations by the IMF TA.
The assessments will eventually cover all SACCOs. The FSRA, however, still faces operational challenges, owing to its
weak capacity and resource constraints.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

KINGDOM OF SWAZILAND

supervisory oversight, and the newly-established FSRA plans to expand the coverage of its
supervisory assessments for all financial sectors, while building capacity for off-site and on-site
supervision and implementing regulatory frameworks for all nonbank financial institutions.

C. Other Surveillance Issues
22.
Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance with some data shortcomings in
national account and fiscal sector statistics. Staff welcomed the authorities’ recent efforts to
update the economic survey as a basis for the national account statistics, which will be rebased and
updated in late 2014. On fiscal data, weak cash management is associated with the lack of proper
fiscal monitoring, which resulted in relatively large unidentified financing (2¾ percent of GDP in
2013/14). To this end, it is critical to conduct reconciliation exercises on a regular basis and
strengthen cash management.

STAFF APPRAISAL
23.
Swaziland’s economy has been recovering from the fiscal crisis of 2010–11. Improved
SACU revenue has relieved the pressure on fiscal and external balances, and economic growth is
gradually recovering. The buildup in international reserves (to 3¾ months by end-March 2014)
suggests that the likelihood of an immediate crisis has receded. Swaziland’s economic outlook,
however, remains subject to downside risks (mainly associated with the uncertain prospects for
South African economy and the high volatility of the SACU revenue). Close monitoring on the
regional and global economic developments is warranted.
24.
Swaziland’s medium-term challenges remain significant. The recent fiscal crisis points to
the need to strengthen Swaziland’s resilience to shocks, while the economy has suffered from weak
growth performance, which has adversely affected social developments. Swaziland’s key economic
policy challenges are therefore to strengthen its resilience to exogenous shocks and achieve high,
inclusive growth, while meeting critical social and development needs. Building on the progress
since the fiscal crisis, Swaziland now stands at a critical juncture to decisively address these
challenges.
25.
To strengthen Swaziland’s resilience to shocks, it is essential to build sufficient
international reserve buffer and maintain modest debt distress. In light of these objectives and
the need to safeguard the exchange rate peg, a prudent fiscal policy stance (with a fiscal deficit
below 2 percent of GDP) should be maintained over the medium-term, while protecting critical
social and development expenditures. Such a prudent fiscal policy stance would help build a
sufficient international reserve buffer (five to seven months of imports) and maintain modest debt
distress, and provide Swaziland with better protection for possible shocks. The prospects for
achieving the prudent fiscal policy target over the medium term, however, appear challenging, in
light of the prospective decline in the SACU revenue and the scheduled salary review for public
officials. It is therefore important to (i) improve revenue administration, (ii) rationalize recurrent

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KINGDOM OF SWAZILAND

expenditure (while safeguarding critical social and development expenditures), (iii) effectively
implement public sector reforms, and (iv) enhance efforts to strengthen PFM.
26.
To address a long-standing problem of weak growth performance, a set of
comprehensive structural reforms should be implemented effectively. The weak growth
performance has been largely associated with a low multiplier of fiscal spending and low private
sector development (depressed private investment in particular). The authorities should improve the
efficiency of spending, through strengthening PFM and public investment management, and
allocating higher weight to growth-promoting capital expenditures. Furthermore, it is also essential
to promote private sector-led, inclusive growth. In particular, enhanced steps should be taken to
further improve business climate, facilitate financial intermediation, and pursue land management
reforms. Should fiscal deficits increase substantially—as envisaged under the medium term fiscal
framework, the government’s large financing needs would likely crowd out private sector credit,
further squeezing private sector developments. Maintaining soundness of the financial sector—with
further efforts to strengthen the supervision and regulation for nonbank financial institutions—is
also critical for private sector-led growth. In most cases, the authorities have rightly acknowledged
the areas of reforms. Staff encouraged the new government to step up efforts to implement reforms,
seeking technical assistance from Swaziland’s international partners, as needed. The CBS’s initiative
to embark on a financial sector strategy is encouraging.
27.
While Swaziland continues to maintain one exchange restriction related to advanced
payments for certain imports (subject to Fund approval under Article VIII), the authorities
have not requested and staff does not recommend the approval of this restriction.
28.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation with Swaziland take place on
the standard 12–month cycle.

Table 1. Swaziland: Risk Assessment Matrix1
Nature/source of main risks
Protracted period of slower growth in
advanced and emerging economies



Advanced economies: Lower-thananticipated potential growth and
persistently low inflation due to a
failure to fully address legacies of the
financial crisis, leading to secular
stagnation.

Likelihood of realization in the next
three years
HIGH ・ Protracted slower growth in
Europe would adversely affect sugar
exports (one of Swaziland’s key export
items) to Europe.
・ Protracted slower growth in South
Africa could lower South Africa’s
imports and weaken demand for
Swaziland’s exports.

Expected impact on economy if risk is realized

Possible Policy Response

MEDIUM
・ External balances would deteriorate with weaker import
demands from Europe and Swaziland’s neighboring countries.
Economic growth would also be affected.

・ Step up structural reforms to
promote private sector
development.
・ Diversify export markets.

HIGH
・ A large decline in SACU revenue would significantly worsen
the fiscal and external balance.
・ Economic growth would slow down, as financing constraint
tightens.

・ Implement fiscal consolidation,
by reducing recurrent
expenditures and enhancing
revenue mobilization.
・ Improve the efficiency of public
spending by strengthening PFM
and enhancing public sector
reforms.
・ Tighten fiscal policy to rebuild
international reserves.
・ Step up structural reforms to
generate private sector jobs.



Emerging markets: Maturing of the
cycle, misallocation of investment, and
incomplete structural reforms leading
to prolonged slower growth.
A temporary decline in SACU revenue
(after 2015/16)

MEDIUM
・ SACU revenue may decline as a
result of possible weakening of import
demand in South Africa or possible
adjustments for previous SACU
revenue.

MEDIUM to HIGH
・ The current interim EPA is set to
expire in October, unless an
agreement on a formal EPA is reached.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
27

KINGDOM OF SWAZILAND

MEDIUM
・ The fiscal surplus would narrow, as the pressure on
government spending intensifies. International reserves would
decline.
・ Current account deficit would increase, but the implications
for growth would be modest, given the low value added
generated by the sector.
MEDIUM
The expiration of AGOA in 2015

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks
listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent,
and “high” a probability of 30 percent or more). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Nonmutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

Appendix I. Exchange Rate Assessment1
1.
Staff analysis suggests that Swaziland’s real effective exchange rate (REER) is
moderately overvalued.2 The estimated results are mixed using different approaches, but overall
points to moderate overvaluation. Since the lilangeni is pegged to South African rand, monetary
policy plays a passive role in Swaziland, following closely the policy rate in South Africa. This points
to the need of structural reforms to improve Swaziland’s competitiveness. It should also be noted
that large uncertainties surround the analysis, as it involves many assumptions and projections.
2.
Swaziland’s real effective exchange rate has been on a declining trend since its peak at
end-2010. The depreciation has followed

3.
Staff assessed the REER based on the IMF’s Consultative Group on Exchange Rate
Issues (CGER) methodology. The CGER methodology includes three different approaches that links
equilibrium exchange rate to a set of fundamentals (Lee et al., 2008). The analysis uses coefficients
from Vitek (2014), which extended the original CGER sample to include many developing countries.
Macroeconomic balance (MB) approach

The MB approach first estimates
Swaziland’s equilibrium current account as 3.8 percent of GDP. The current account is
modeled on Swaziland’s economic conditions,
mostly relative to its trading partners. Specifically, it
is computed as a function of the levels of these

variables projected to prevail in the medium term (2019). One exception is the net foreign asset
(NFA) position, for which the latest data are for 2010, from the (updated) External Wealth of Nation
database (Lane and Milesi-Ferretti, 2007). The NFA to GDP ratio stood at -3.9 percent in 2010, which
is used in the calculation.
5.
This approach suggests an overvaluation of Swaziland’s REER by 7.4 percent.
The exchange rate misalignment is the REER adjustment needed to close the gap between the
equilibrium current account and the “underlying” current account. The medium-term (2019)
projection of the current account (-2.8 percent of GDP) is taken to be the underlying current
account, i.e., the level that would emerge at a zero output gap both for Swaziland and its trading
partners. Using Swaziland’s specific elasticity (0.28) and also controlling for multi-lateral consistency
(a common correction factor to the estimated exchange rate adjustments since there can only be n–
1 independent exchange rates among n currencies), this suggests an overvaluation of Swaziland’s
REER by 7.4 percent.
Equilibrium real exchange rate (ERER) approach
6.
The ERER approach,however, suggests some undervaluation. The ERER approach models
equilibrium real exchange rate as a function of (projected) medium-term values of fundamentals.
The equilibrium REER is then compared with the latest real exchange rate data (February 2014),

weight to the MB approach.
External sustainability (ES) approach
7.
Under the ES approach, the equilibrium current account is the level that would
stabilize the ratio of the net foreign asset position to GDP at its 2010 level (the latest
observation). The current account norm, based on medium-term projection for nominal GDP
growth, is -0.3 percent of GDP. Comparing this to the projected 2019 current account suggests an
overvaluation of the REER at about 11 percent.

Appendix II. Adequate International Reserves 1
1.
Swaziland’s international reserve
level has grown rapidly over the past
two years with the recovery of the SACU
revenue. Reserve coverage dropped to 2.3
months of imports at end–2011, following a
sharp decline of SACU receipts over
2010‒11. Gross official reserves stood at
US$732 million at end-March 2014, or 3.8
months of imports.

traditional metrics based on imports, short-term debt and broad money. The traditional metrics,
based on simple rules of thumb, certainly have relevance and the attraction of simplicity, but are by
their nature arbitrary, and focus only on a particular aspect of vulnerability, and could give disparate
results (IMF 2011a).

3.
The current international
reserves also exceed the level based on
the standard IMF metric. This metric is a
weighted average of four indicators, and
seems to predict exchange market pressure
and other crisis events better than
traditional metrics (IMF 2011a, 2011b).
Specifically, the metric for countries with
fixed exchange rate regime is computed as:

Equity liabilities data are from the (updated) External Wealth of Nation database (Lane and Milesi Ferretti, 2007), where the latest observation is for 2010 (US$68 million). The suggested reserve
coverage is 100 to 150 percent of the metric, and Swaziland’s current coverage reaches 184 percent.
This metric, however, does not take into account Swaziland specific risks.

5.
Swaziland’s own experience suggests that these levels of reserve are not adequate for
it to withstand a severe external shock as experienced during 2010–11. Before the crisis,
international reserves stood at 4 months of imports, or 24 percent of GDP at end–2009. Yet, the
government experienced the fiscal crisis, with marked reduction in spending during 2010‒11 (when
the SACU revenue declined substantially), and reserve coverage dropped to 2.3 months of imports
at end–2011.
6.
To incorporate Swaziland-specific risks (regarding the uncertainty associated with the
SACU revenue), modified metrics are explored. The variables used in the standard IMF metric are
selected based on past episodes of exchange market pressure in emerging markets, where the
coefficient assigned to each variable is based on the size of changes for these indicators during
those episodes. For Swaziland, the largest shock, the crisis of 2010–11, came as a sharp decline in
the SACU revenue. In particular, accumulated decline of SACU revenue during 2010‒11 amounted to
94 percent of the SACU revenue before the crisis. In terms of GDP, the SACU revenue declined from
19½ percent in 2009 to 9–10 percent in 2010–11. Using the same concept for the construction of
the standard IMF metric, we therefore explore the following two modified metrics which would be
more suitable for Swaziland:


The coefficient of 94 percent for the SACU revenue is used, in light of the changes in the
SACU revenue from the pre-crisis level (2009).2
30% of STD+ 15% of OPL + 10% of M2 + 10% of X + 94% of SACU revenue.



A more conservative coefficient of 80 percent for the SACU revenue is used
30% of STD+ 15% of OPL + 10% of M2 + 10% of X + 80% of SACU revenue.

7.
Maintaining a 100 percent coverage of these metrics would call for international
reserves at 33 percent of GDP (5½ months of imports) and 30 percent of GDP (5 months of
imports), respectively. Maintaining a 150 percent coverage would call for international reserves at
more than 45 percent of GDP (7½ months of imports).
8.
Reserve adequacy is further analyzed using a cost-benefit analysis approach. DablaNorris et al. (2011) develop a cost-benefit approach to quantify the optimal level of reserves in lowincome countries, focusing on the role of reserves in preventing and mitigating absorption drops
triggered by large external shocks. Specifically, countries are assumed to maximize the net benefit of
holding reserves (NBR):

Where P and C represent, respectively, the conditional probability of a crisis given a large shock
event and the utility cost of a crisis—where a crisis is defined by a sharp drop in absorption. Both of
these variables depend on reserves R and other control variables (W and Z). The parameters q refers
to the unconditional probability of a large shock event, which is set to be 0.4 based on the sample
average. Large shock events are identified if the annual percentage change of the relevant variable
falls below the 10th percentile in the left-tail of the country-specific distribution. In particular, shock
episodes include one or more of the following six shocks: external demand, terms-of-trade, FDI, aid
flows, remittances, and large natural disasters. Finally, r represents the opportunity cost of holding
reserves.
9.
Relevant values for Swaziland are derived from historical distributions. Higher fiscal
balance is found to be associated with smaller probability of crisis. We used the estimated fiscal
balance for 2013/14. Higher World Bank’s CPIA index, a broad indicator of the quality of a country’s
present policy and institutional framework, is also associated with lower crisis probability. The CPIA
index is not available for Swaziland, so we used the value for Lesotho instead. Changes in external
demand, terms of trade, FDI and aid to GDP ratio all affect the absorption loss when there is a crisis.
For these variables, we used the 10th percentile figure over the past 20 years. The external demand is
compiled as the weighted average of real GDP growth of South Africa, the Euro area, and the U.S.
using 2005 export share as the weights.

In conclusion, Swaziland needs to further increase its reserve coverage from the
current level to secure sufficient buffer for exogenous shocks. While there are uncertainties to
the exact optimal level of reserves, the analyses using various methodologies suggest that Swaziland
should increase its international reserve coverage to 30%-40% of GDP (equivalent to 5-7 months of
imports).

Appendix III. Debt Sustainability Analysis
Though Swaziland’s public debt is low, large gross financing needs raise concerns. The debt
sustainability analysis (DSA) indicates that, under the baseline scenario, most of the public debt
indicators remain below their relevant indicative thresholds over the medium term, although high gross
financing needs raises concerns for rollover risks and possible crowding-out of private sector credit.
Should the SACU revenue fall significantly (as experienced in 2010–11), the debt level would rise
sharply, leaving little scope for absorbing shocks.
Recent Developments
1.
Swaziland’s public debt remains low, although it has gradually and continuously risen
for the past few years. The debt increased in nominal terms from 13 percent of GDP in 2009 to
nearly 18 percent of GDP in 2013, owing to a large increase in primary deficit (particularly during the
fiscal crisis in 2010–2011). Meanwhile, gross financing needs remain high, at about 10 percent of
GDP, owing to an increasing reliance on short-term public debt. While improved SACU revenue after
the fiscal crisis has relieved pressure on the fiscal front, a fiscal surplus was recorded for 2012 and
2013.
2.
The central government has steadily increased their reliance on domestic debt for its
borrowing needs. In terms of the composition of public debt, the proportion of debt denominated
in domestic currency increased over time, reducing exposure to exchange rate risk. The share of
domestic debt rose from 11 percent of total public debt in 2009 to about 50 percent in 2013. By the
end of 2013, treasury bonds account for around 65 percent of the government’s domestic debt.
Treasury bills make up the balance of domestic debt, with the 91-days accounting for 41 percent of
total treasury bills.
3.
The country’s external public debt—primarily in the form of project loans from
bilateral and multilateral sources as well as private creditors—is relatively high (51 percent of
the total debt), albeit on a declining trend. While its importance—relative to domestic public
debt—has declined, the composition of external public debt has been quite stable over the past few
years. Financing from multilateral organizations has accounted for nearly 60 percent of external
public debt, while bilateral project loans and loans from private creditors have made up 30 and
10 percent of external public debt, respectively.
Medium Term Public DSA
4.
A heat map suggests that, while the public debt level is not subject to imminent risks,
the country faces risks relating to its gross financing needs and debt profile (Figure 1). Under
the baseline scenario, the gross financing needs would increase continuously and reach 15 percent of
GDP benchmark by 2018. All standard macro-fiscal shocks would push the gross financing needs
even higher. In particular, the standard primary balance shock and the combined macro-fiscal shock
would raise the gross financing needs above the benchmark by 2016. The large share of debt held by
non-residents—albeit on a downward trend—also highlights vulnerabilities in the debt profile.

Baseline Scenario
5.
The baseline macroeconomic scenario for the DSA is based on the status-quo policies,
consistent with the macroeconomic framework underlying the 2014 Article IV Staff Report.
Specifically, growth is expected to remain sluggish (at about 2 percent per annum), reflecting low
private sector investment. With a prospective decline in the SACU revenue (to a historical average of
17 percent of GDP), the fiscal revenues would slightly decline by 2015 and remain stable around
32 percent of GDP until 2019. Fiscal expenditures would increase by around 3 percentage points of
GDP over the same period, taking into account spending pressure arising from the prospective
review of wage bills and increasing interest payments. As a result, fiscal deficit is expected to increase
by around 5 percentage points of GDP between 2013 and 2019. The realism of this scenario for DSA
purposes is assessed in Figure 2. While the forecast errors for Swaziland for real GDP growth and
inflation (deflator) have been mostly in line with other countries, those for the primary balance have
been relatively larger—mostly reflecting the high uncertainty associated with prospective SACU
revenue.
6.
The DSA under the baseline scenario indicates that the debt level would stay modest
over the medium term, although the fast pace of debt accumulation and the projected
increase in gross financing needs raise concerns (Figure 3 and 4). Under the baseline scenario, the
expected increase in fiscal deficits would lead to fast accumulation of public debt. The primary deficit
averages about 2 percent of GDP during 2014–2019. Gross public debt would reach 30 percent of
GDP by 2019. As it is expected to be financed mainly domestically by short- and medium-term
treasury bills/bond, gross financing needs are projected to grow continuously, from 10 percent of
GDP in 2013 to about 16 percent of GDP in 2019.
7.
The alternative scenarios indicate that a prudent fiscal policy stance, if maintained over
the medium term, would help to avoid a continuous increase in public debt and a high level of
public gross financing needs. Assuming a constant primary balance from 2014 onwards, public
gross financing needs would be brought down to around 8 percent of GDP by 2019, and gross public
debt would be around 17 percent of GDP. A similar result would be achieved under the historical
scenario where the real GDP growth, the primary balance, and the real interest rate are set at their
historical averages.
Macro-Fiscal and Additional Stress Tests
8.
While public debt dynamics are resilient to several stress tests, high gross financing
needs point to emerging risks associated with the maturity structure and crowding out of the
private sector credit. The results of the standardized macro-fiscal stress tests do not fundamentally
alter the broad outlook for public debt previously discussed.1 Under all standardized sensitivity cases,
1

The macro-fiscal stress tests include standard shocks to growth and interest rates, a primary balance shock
(a deterioration in the primary balance by a half of its 10-year historical standard deviation), an exchange rate shock
(equal to a maximum historical movement over the past 10 years and an estimated exchange rate pass-through
of 0.25), and a combined shock.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KINGDOM OF SWAZILAND

the public debt-to-GDP ratio nearly reaches 35 percent by the end of the projection period.
Nonetheless, the macro-fiscal shocks (especially the primary balance shock) result in a more rapid
increase in gross financing needs to around 17 to 19 percent of GDP by end–2019. The rapid
increase in gross financing needs could potentially crowd out the private sector credit, as well as
posing risks related to the maturity structure and debt roll-over.
9.
The customized stress test, which simulates a SACU revenue shock, leads a relatively
large increase in both public debt and gross financing needs. Given the heavy reliance on
customs and excise revenues from SACU, the macroeconomic outlook is subject to downside risks
related to external environment.2 The customized shock, whereby SACU revenue temporarily falls to
9 percent of GDP in 2017–2018, would increase risks significantly.3 Gross public debt would be
estimated at 49 percent of GDP at end–2019. Moreover, the gross financing needs would exceed the
benchmark of 15 percent of GDP by 2016, and reach 25 percent of GDP by 2019.
10.
Under the reform scenario, public debt and gross financing needs are projected to be
sustainable over the medium term. To strengthen the country’s resilience to exogenous shocks,
the reform scenario assumes a prudent fiscal policy, together with structural reform to stimulate
growth (see main text). Such a fiscal policy stance—largely achieved through reduction in
government recurrent expenditures—would also create fiscal space for critical social and
development spending. As a result of these reforms, the primary deficit averages about 0.2 percent
of GDP during 2014–2019. Public debt would be stabilized around 20 percent of GDP over the
projection period, and gross financing needs would stay at a lower level, about 10 percent of GDP on
average.
Medium Term External DSA
11.
Swaziland’s gross external debt has remained low and recently declined slightly from
nearly 19 percent of GDP in 2009 to around 17 percent of GDP in 2013. Public external debt
accounted for around 52 percent of gross external debt in 2013. Under the baseline assumptions,
gross external debt is projected to only slightly increase to about 13 percent of GDP in 2019.
12.
Stress tests, while pointing no imminent concerns for external debt trajectory,
indicates vulnerability to shocks to the non-interest current account and large exchange rate
depreciations. Standardized sensitivity analysis suggests that Swaziland’s external debt is resilient to
interest rate and growth shocks, but a 30 percent real depreciation would raise the external debt-toGDP ratio to around 20 percent in 2019. A current account deficit that is 3 percentage points of GDP
(one-half standard deviations) larger than projected in the baseline would likely put the country on
2

Specifically, Swaziland is subject to outward spillovers from exogenous shocks to South Africa’s economic
performance. In particular, constrained external demand from Europe and the pull back of capital flows could
adversely affect South African economy, and thus, result in weaker SACU revenues and terms of trade.

This customized shock is based on the level of SACU revenues during the 2010–11 fiscal crisis, which was 9 percent
of GDP.

an unsustainable path, as the external debt-to-GDP ratio would increase to 30 percent by 2019. Thus,
moderating the non-interest part of the external current account balance is important for external
debt sustainability.
Conclusion
13.
Overall, the DSA indicates that, though the debt level is not posed to imminent risks,
high gross financing needs and projected pace of debt accumulation raise concerns.
Both public debt and external debt are on sustainable trajectories under the baseline scenario, and
the results of stress tests indicate that debt dynamics are generally resilient to several shocks over
the medium term. Nonetheless, should the expected pace of debt accumulation continue over the
longer period, Swaziland could soon face higher debt distress. In addition, the analysis found that
the public debt outlook is particularly vulnerable to a shock of SACU revenue. Furthermore,
increasing gross financing needs projections—with excessive reliance on short- and medium-term
financing—raise concerns for risks associated with distorted maturity structure, debt roll-over, and
crowding-out of private sector credit.
14.
Addressing these concerns is important for macroeconomic stability over the medium
term. As presented in the analysis under the reform scenario, it is important to maintain a prudent
fiscal policy stance over the medium term, which would moderate the pace of debt accumulation.
Given that the economy has been recovering from the fiscal crisis with the return of confidence, the
authorities should take this opportunity to seek diversification of financing sources.

Appendix IV. Fiscal Multiplier in Swaziland1
For the past two decades potential growth has continually decelerated in Swaziland. Although the
government has significantly expanded its outlays, they seem to have had a low impact on growth.
The estimations suggest the fiscal multiplier in Swaziland is about 0.1. To increase the growth impact
of public spending, the authorities could favor capital as opposed to current expenditures and improve
public financial management.

A.

Introduction

1.
For the past three decades the government pursued expansionary fiscal policies, while
trend growth has continually decelerated. In the early 80’s growth averaged about 8 percent and
thereafter it has continually decreased. Potential growth is currently estimated to be around
2 percent. At the same time the government pursued expansionary fiscal policies, as it increased its
spending by about 20 percentage points of GDP in the past two decades.

2.
Against this backdrop of increasing expenditures and decelerating growth, it appears
that public spending in Swaziland has a low growth impact. This note estimates the effect of
discretionary fiscal policy shocks on output (the so-called fiscal multiplier) and discusses some policy
options to increase the output effect of public spending.

Literature Review

3.
The fiscal multiplier is typically estimated using one of three competing
methodologies. General equilibrium models (DSGE) as in Christiano et. al. (2011), structural vector
autoregressions (SVAR) as in Blanchard and Perotti (2002), or with the so-called narrative approach
(event analysis) as in Romer and Romer (2010).
4.
There is no consensus on how to estimate the fiscal multiplier, as each of the above
techniques has its own merits and pitfalls. The main drawback from the DSGEs is that the fiscal
multiplier is ultimately determined by the assumptions and the calibration of the model.
The narrative approach, intends to capture the effects of specific unexpected policy changes,
however it typically suffers from endogeneity issues. SVARs are specifically designed to control for
the automatic responses of endogenous variables, but require identification assumptions to recover
the structural shocks.
5.
Empirical estimates of the fiscal multiplier tend to vary with country characteristics.
Ilzetzki et. al. (2013) show that the multiplier tends to be larger in industrial than in emerging
economies; under predetermined exchange rate regimes and zero with flexible exchange rates;
smaller in economies that are more open to trade; and might even be negative in highly indebted
countries. Moreover as shown by Auerbach and Gorodnichenko (2012), the multiplier also varies for
a given country, depending on the state of the economy (larger during downturns).

C.

Estimation of Fiscal Multiplier in Swaziland

6.
This section presents some estimates of the multiplier for Swaziland, using a
traditional SVAR approach. It should be noted, however, that given the severe data limitations,
the exercise can only be conducted with annual data which casts some doubt on the identified
structural fiscal shocks. Thus, the estimates should be interpreted with care.
7.
The estimation includes two endogenous variables (real GDP and real government
primary expenditures) and one exogenous variable (South Africa’s real GDP) to control for
the external environment. The estimation sample is from 1980 to 2013 and uses three lags (with
less lags the errors have some residual autocorrelation, and with higher lags the results are similar).
As explained above, since government spending affects GDP but output developments might also
affect economic spending, the structural shocks are recovered with the standard assumption that
real GDP shocks do not have a contemporaneous effect on fiscal policy.

8.
The expenditure multiplier in Swaziland is close to 0.1. The response to an exogenous
shock to total expenditures (normalized to unity) is presented in Figure 2. As explained in Battini et.
al. (2014), the effect vanishes after some periods (left panel), and has an inverted U shape with the
maximum impact occurring in the second period (right panel). More precisely, after three periods
the ratio of the accumulated response of output to the accumulated increase in spending (the fiscal
multiplier) is around 0.1.

D.

Factors Contributing to a Low Fiscal Multiplier in Swaziland

9.
The composition of expenditures plays an important role in determining the effects of
fiscal stimulus. The response to normalized shocks to current expenditures and public investment
are presented in Figure 3 and Figure 4. Both shocks last about three periods, but the multipliers are
0.05 and 0.5, respectively. These estimates are broadly consistent with the work of Ilzetzki et. al.
(2013). They find that in emerging markets spending multipliers range from 0.1 to 0.3, explained by
a government consumption multiplier of zero and a public investment multiplier of 0.6. Moreover, as
can be observed in Figure 5, the increase in government expenditures in the past three decades in
Swaziland has also been accompanied by a decline in the share of public investment (which would
tend to lower the size of the multiplier).

The efficiency of public spending is correlated with the quality of public investment
management (PIM). Arizala (2014) estimates fiscal multipliers using a panel SVAR for a sample of
40 emerging and advanced economies, and finds that the quality of public investment management

Other factors may have also contributed to the low multiplier in Swaziland.
As explained in Battini et. al. (2014), more open economies tend to have lower multipliers and
Swaziland is in the 80th percentiles of the world distribution of openness to trade (with exports and
imports around 50 and 70 percent of GDP). Such a high degree of openness results from the
customs union with South Africa, which has an economy that is one hundred times larger than that
of Swaziland. As a result, the industrial base in Swaziland is small and relatively underdeveloped.

E.

Conclusions

12.
The growth effect of public spending is low in Swaziland and several factors may explain this
result. First, although expenditures have risen significantly during the last two decades, an increasing
share has been allocated for recurrent rather than capital spending. Secondly, a relatively weak
public investment management has lowered the efficiency of spending. Finally, Swaziland’s high
propensity to import and its limited industrial base has resulted in a foreign demand leakage of
fiscal spending. Thus, to improve the fiscal multiplier, it would be helpful to allocate higher weight to
capital expenditures; improve the quality of PFM; and enhance the industrial base to reduce the
dependency on imports.

Swaziland faces critical
challenges to improve its growth
performance. The slowdown in
economic growth—observed in the
past decades—has been apparently
associated with its inability to
maintain private investment crucial for
sustainable economic development
(Figure 1). A couple of structural
factors—some of which are also
discussed in the World Bank’s resent
paper on growth in Swaziland (World
Bank, 2014)—are identified behind
these private sector developments.

First, relatively weak business environments in Swaziland have undermined private
sector development, as recognized in the Economic Recovery Strategy (ERS) and the Investor
Road Map (IRM). According to the World Bank’s 2014 Doing Business Indicators, Swaziland is
ranked 123rd out of 189th countries on the ease of doing business. Although some indicators show
relatively good performance (e.g. dealing with construction permit and paying taxes), Swaziland
ranks 172th and 176th on the ease of starting business and contract enforcement, respectively.3
Though efforts have been made to formulate strategies (e.g., the Investor Road Map and the
Economic Recovery Strategy) to enhance private sector development, their implementation has
been limited.4

These indicators should be interpreted with caution due to a limited number of respondents, a limited geographical
coverage, and standardized assumptions on business constraints and information availability.

The recent achievements in the business climate reforms include: the introduction of VAT in 2012 (replacing the
general sales tax) and the amendments of the Trade Licensing Act and the Shop Trading Hours Act in 2011.

Starting a business in Swaziland is more difficult, relative to the average of Sub-Saharan
African countries. The number of procedures to legally start and operate a company in
Swaziland has remained relatively high, and there has been no improvement in the costs of
starting a business, while Sub-Saharan African countries, on average, have made progress.
Meanwhile, contract enforcement in Swaziland—an indicator for the protection of investor
rights—is quite slow (it takes about 952 days to enforce contracts) and costly (56.1 percent
of the claim).

Furthermore, the World Economic Forum’s 2014 Global Competitiveness Indicators suggest
that the major constraints to doing business in Swaziland are inefficient government
bureaucracy, corruption, and access to financing. Particularly, relatively low domestic credit
to private sector and the decline in access to finance suggest a potential room to improve
credit, and thus, private sector activities.

Second, macroeconomic uncertainties and prolonged weak growth performance may
have also adversely affected investor confidence. The recent fiscal crisis has proven Swaziland’s
vulnerability to exogenous shocks which has likely increased investors’ perceived macroeconomic
risks. Furthermore, with prolonged weak growth performance, the expected returns from investment
are likely undermined. Swaziland seems to be trapped in a “vicious cycle,” with sluggish growth
prospects leading to low private investment, which in turn lowers the growth potential.

4.
Third, high HIV/AIDS prevalence and slow progress on human development also
appears to hold back investment and economic growth, while the recent improvement in
medical treatment may mitigate some of the adverse effects of HIV/AIDS. The impact of the
HIV/AIDS epidemic (prevalence rate is estimated at around 26.5 percent of adults ages 15−49 for
2012 (UNAIDS, 2013)) has resulted in high mitigation costs, absenteeism, and loss of human capital,
which has adversely affected labor productivity and lowered the returns to investment (Simtowe et
al., 2011; and Asiedu et al., 2012). This together with the low levels of human capital—as measured
by the quality of education and training and labor market efficiency—may be possible factors
behind skills mismatch, and high unemployment (IMF, 2013). Skills mismatch and structural
unemployment could, in turn, restrict investment in new sectors with high growth potential. Going
forward, however, as the HIV/AIDS prevalence rate has stabilized, and medical treatment options
have recently improved, economic costs associated with HIV/AIDS are likely to be lowered,
mitigating the adverse impacts on growth and private sector investments.

Fourth, some rigidities in land markets may have adversely affected private sector
developments. Based on discussions with the Swaziland Investment Promotion Authority and
investors, the World Bank (2014) identified tremendous demand from private sector investors for
land. However, some features seem to prevent greater investment in the sector and a more efficient
use of land. These include: (i) lack clarity and documentation of Swazi Nation Land (SNL)
smallholders, which may limit some room to negotiate a more effective use of the land and may
lower the incentives to invest in productivity-enhancing technology; (ii) limited access to credit,
fragmentation and coordination problems for SNL smallholders, and (iii) unclear legal framework
governing commercial investors’ access to land. Creating a clear, transparent legal and regulatory
framework for commercial investors and supporting new initiatives in SNL can lead to higher and
more sustained levels of investment in the sector. Therefore, improvements in land governance and
management can help attract investment into agriculture and reinvigorate growth in the sector and
the overall economy. The Draft Land Policy (2009)—an initial step towards providing a practical
framework to deal with these issues, though further consensus is required—has been prepared but
not approved by the Parliament. This, in addition, has led to private investors’ perceived uncertainty
in land policies and markets.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Swaziland is assessed as “Category B” with regards to data adequacy for surveillance
Purposes (data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance). Staff’s analysis
is mainly affected by shortcomings in the national accounts and fiscal sector.
Real sector statistics: STA missions have improved the national accounts. However, significant
weaknesses remain, including the lack of timely and accurate GDP numbers—the latest data is for 2009
(released in September, 2010). Annual GDP estimates at current and constant prices are compiled using
both the production and expenditure approaches. The Central Statistical Office (CSO) is currently working
to update benchmark and base years from 1985 to 2011 (new estimates for 2010–2013 will be published
by end year). Shortcomings remain with regards to the treatment of Southern African Customs Union
(SACU) revenue. Although the SACU group meeting at end-2012 resulted in a common understanding
among technicians from the statistical offices, the treatment of SACU revenue in national accounts has yet
to be agreed by member commissions.
CSO publishes labor market statistics with long delays. The most recent unemployment data is for 2010
and the 2013 numbers are only expected to be released by end–2014. For 2015, the authorities are
planning to conduct the second labor force survey (first was published in 2010).
The consumer price index was significantly revised in May 2007 in the context of the GDDS initiative,
incorporating improvements in compilation methodology, market basket coverage, flexibility for
introducing new pricing outlets and new varieties of products, and enhanced processing capabilities. Four
new geographical indices, as well as a national index, with updated market basket weights, are now
available. Monthly consumer price data are published by CSO with a one-month lag.
Monetary and financial statistics: Although some progress was achieved in the reporting of data on the
other depository corporations (ODCs), quality problems remained, particularly in the areas of coverage,
classification, and sectorization. The institutional coverage of the depository corporations’ survey is
limited, as it covers only the CBS and the commercial banks. The CBS started to include the Swaziland
Building Society into the monetary data backdated to December 2006. The credit and savings
cooperatives, representing about 8 percent of the deposits of the commercial banks, remain outside the
deposit corporations’ survey.
External sector statistics: Annual balance of payments statistics are compiled by the CBS according to a
methodology consistent with the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5). However,
shortcomings in the timeliness and availability of trade data impart a certain degree of uncertainty to
external sector statistics and surveillance. The CSO publishes data on foreign trade on a quarterly basis,
but further actions are required to improve the accuracy and reliability of external sector data.
II. Data Standards and Quality
No data ROSC is available.
Participant in the General Data Dissemination
System (GDDS) since February 11, 2003.
III. Reporting to STA
The CBS reports monetary and financial statistics to STA regularly, although the timeliness of data could
be improved. Balance of payments data are published in International Financial Statistics (IFS) and in the
Balance of Payments Yearbook.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with Swaziland

On July 15, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with Swaziland and considered and endorsed the staff appraisal without
a meeting.2
Swaziland’s economic performance has improved since the fiscal crisis of 2010–11, underpinned
by the recovery of revenues from the Southern African Customs Union (SACU). Real Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) growth in 2013 is estimated at 2¾ percent, recovering from -½ percent
in 2011. Business confidence has started to show signs of improvement, commercial bank credit
to the private sector is growing strongly, and the risk premium on treasury bills has been
declining. Meanwhile, inflation has slightly risen, reaching 5.3 percent in April 2014, owing to
increases in food and some administered prices.
Improved SACU revenues since 2012/13 reduced the pressure on fiscal and external balances. A
budget surplus of 4½ percent of GDP was recorded in 2012/13. In 2013/14, despite increasing
spending pressure, a small budget surplus (¼ percent of GDP) is estimated, partly aided by
enhanced domestic revenue collection efforts. International reserves have reached 3¾ months of
imports by March 2014, recovering from the low level of 2 months at end-March 2012.
Swaziland’s banking sector appears well capitalized, with the capital adequacy ratio of the banks
reaching 24 percent of risk-weighted assets. Nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs)— including
pension funds, insurance companies, collective investment schemes, and savings and credit
cooperatives—account for about two-thirds of the financial sector (in terms of assets). With less
than complete supervisory surveillance over these institutions, assessing relevant risks remains
difficult.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.
2

Article IV consultations are concluded without a Board meeting when the following conditions apply: (i) there are
no acute or significant risks, or general policy issues requiring Board discussion; (ii) policies or circumstances are
unlikely to have significant regional or global impact; (iii) in the event a parallel program review is being completed,
it is also being completed on a lapse-of-time basis; and (iv) the use of Fund resources is not under discussion or
anticipated.

2

Swaziland faces significant forward looking challenges. Though growth rebounded after the
crisis, the long-term growth trend remains low, with average real GDP growth over 2004–13 at
about two percent per year, and Swaziland would remain vulnerable to exogenous shocks.
Furthermore, there are risks to Swaziland’s economic prospects, in particular the uncertain global
and regional economic outlook that could lower SACU revenues. In addition, Swaziland
continues to face serious development challenges, including high unemployment, poverty, and
the prevalence of HIV/AIDS. Swaziland’s key economic policy challenges therefore are to
strengthen its resilience to exogenous shocks and achieve higher and more inclusive growth,
while meeting critical social and development needs.
Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the 2014 Article IV consultation with Swaziland, Executive directors endorsed
staff’s appraisal, as follows:
Swaziland’s economy has been recovering from the fiscal crisis of 2010–11. Improved SACU
revenue has relieved the pressure on fiscal and external balances, and economic growth is
gradually recovering. The buildup in international reserves (to 3¾ months by end-March 2014)
suggests that the likelihood of an immediate crisis has receded. Swaziland’s economic outlook,
however, remains subject to downside risks (mainly associated with the uncertain prospects for
South African economy and the high volatility of the SACU revenue). Close monitoring on the
regional and global economic developments is warranted.
Swaziland’s medium-term challenges remain significant. The recent fiscal crisis points to the
need to strengthen Swaziland’s resilience to shocks, while the economy has suffered from weak
growth performance, which has adversely affected social developments. Swaziland’s key
economic policy challenges are therefore to strengthen its resilience to exogenous shocks and
achieve high, inclusive growth, while meeting critical social and development needs. Building on
the progress since the fiscal crisis, Swaziland now stands at a critical juncture to decisively
address these challenges.
To strengthen Swaziland’s resilience to shocks, it is essential to build sufficient international
reserve buffer and maintain modest debt distress. In light of these objectives and the need to
safeguard the exchange rate peg, a prudent fiscal policy stance (with a fiscal deficit below 2
percent of GDP) should be maintained over the medium-term, while protecting critical social and
development expenditures. Such a prudent fiscal policy stance would help build a sufficient
international reserve buffer (five to seven months of imports) and maintain modest debt distress,
and provide Swaziland with better protection for possible shocks. The prospects for achieving
the prudent fiscal policy target over the medium term, however, appear challenging, in light of
the prospective decline in the SACU revenue and the scheduled salary review for public
officials. It is therefore important to (i) improve revenue administration, (ii) rationalize recurrent
expenditure (while safeguarding critical social and development expenditures), (iii) effectively
implement public sector reforms, and (iv) enhance efforts to strengthen public financial
management (PFM).

3
To address a long-standing problem of weak growth performance, a set of comprehensive
structural reforms should be implemented effectively. The weak growth performance has been
largely associated with a low multiplier of fiscal spending and low private sector development
(depressed private investment in particular). The authorities should improve the efficiency of
spending, through strengthening PFM and public investment management, and allocating higher
weight to growth-promoting capital expenditures. Furthermore, it is also essential to promote
private sector-led, inclusive growth. In particular, enhanced steps should be taken to further
improve business climate, facilitate financial intermediation, and pursue land management
reforms. Should fiscal deficits increase substantially—as envisaged under the medium term fiscal
framework, the government’s large financing needs would likely crowd out private sector credit,
further squeezing private sector developments. Maintaining soundness of the financial sector—
with further efforts to strengthen the supervision and regulation for nonbank financial
institutions—is also critical for private sector-led growth. In most cases, the authorities have
rightly acknowledged the areas of reforms. Staff encouraged the new government to step up
efforts to implement reforms, seeking technical assistance from Swaziland’s international
partners, as needed. The CBS’s initiative to embark on a financial sector strategy is encouraging.
While Swaziland continues to maintain one exchange restriction related to advanced payments
for certain imports (subject to Fund approval under Article VIII), the authorities have not
requested and staff does not recommend the approval of this restriction.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation with Swaziland take place on the
standard 12–month cycle.
