STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
February 19, 2014

KEY ISSUES:
With growth projected at just over 1 percent in 2014, recovery from the stagnation
of 2012–13 is proving slow, as in much of Europe. Healthy private balance sheets and
integration with Germany dampened the impact of the crisis. However, despite its
resilience the economy has been losing competitiveness due to higher labor cost and
lower productivity growths than peer countries. The government has taken measures to
close the wage gap, but the economy also needs to become more productive and
adaptable through deeper product and labor market reforms. Low rates of employment
further penalize growth. The government has reformed social benefits to increase
activation, but there is scope to further reduce inactivity traps and to shift resources
from passive to active labor market policies.
Short-term risks come mostly from the external environment, but failure of
structural reforms to keep up with competitive pressures is a more significant
medium-term risk. Deleveraging has significantly reduced financial sector risks, and,
while the sovereign-bank nexus remains important, cross exposures are being unwound.
Ability of banks to maintain adequate capital buffers in the face of low profitability
remains a risk.
Public finances are under repair. Structural adjustment of 1.1 percent of GDP was
achieved in 2012–13, but another 3.3 percent is still needed to meet the authorities’
medium-term target. Gradual but steady structural adjustment of 0.75 percent a year
toward that objective appears appropriate in view of current cyclical conditions. At the
same time, the effort should be redirected from revenue to spending measures. Fiscal
consolidation remains challenging because of the complex fiscal structure of Belgium,
but the task has been helped by a new burden sharing agreement which clarifies the
consolidation responsibilities of the regional and federal governments.
The main challenge for banks is to move from balance sheet repair to adjustment
of business models in the face of low profitability and regulatory changes. The
balance sheet of banks has come down from 410 percent of GDP in 2008 to 268 percent
in mid–2013. Solvency and liquidity ratios are improving, but profitability has been weak
owing to low interest margins and high operating costs. The supervisory and regulatory
frameworks are being strengthened, notably with a new draft banking law which
restrains trading activities and improves the recovery and resolution framework,
including by increasing buffers for depositor protection.

ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL CONTEXT
1.
The government’s term comes to an end with elections in May 2014. Under the latest
state reform, federal elections will henceforth coincide with regional and European elections on a
five year cycle. During its 2½ year mandate, the government took actions to stabilize and reform the
economy and has put forth a major banking reform, which is now before parliament.
2.
Economic integration with Germany and healthy private balance sheets dampened the
impact of the crisis. Real GDP is now 1.3 percent above the pre-crisis peak (Figure 1). Germany
remains Belgium’s main trading partner absorbing 17.4 percent of Belgium’s exports, with many
companies firmly anchored in the supply chains of German chemical, pharmaceutical, and
automobile industries (Box 1). Supported by subsidized job schemes, employment has also fared
better than in much of Europe. Household debt, essentially mortgages, has increased in line with
real estate prices, but remains below the euro area average. Relatively low debt has also shielded the
non-financial corporate sector (NFC) from financial stress (Figure 2).
3.
However, as elsewhere in Europe, the recovery from the 2012 slowdown is proceeding
slowly and inflation has declined to around 1.2 percent. The economy bottomed out in 2013Q1,
and since then growth has averaged 1.1 percent in annualized terms. The recovery has been driven
by modest growth in private and public consumption and a significant contribution from net trade,
with investment remaining weak. Overall, the contribution of final domestic demand (excluding
inventory changes) is estimated to be flat in 2013. For the first time since 2009, CPI inflation has
declined faster than in neighboring countries, on the back of developments and reforms of the
energy market.

Box 1. Belgium in the Global Value Chains
The increasing fragmentation of production across borders–the “Global Value Chains” (GVCs)–is
transforming the trade landscape. Countries that integrate more effectively in the GVCs appear to achieve
better export performance and higher growth.1 But export performance also depends on the cost and
quality of non-tradable inputs, and in this regard Belgium’s export performance is likely to be penalized by
low productivity in the services sector.
Belgium appears to be well integrated in the GVC centered around Germany (figure). In 2011, exports of
intermediate goods and services to Germany amounted to 8 percent of GDP, compared to 2 percent for
France and 9 percent for the Netherlands. On the import side, about 40 percent of Belgium’s consumption
of intermediate goods and services was imported, compared with 27 percent on average for its three
neighboring countries (France, Germany, and the Netherlands). Half of these imported inputs came from its
four largest European partners.

But integration in the GVCs does not necessarily increase the value added content of exports. Information
on the value added content of exports is very limited, however. Data compiled by the OECD and the World
Trade Organization suggests that the value added content of Belgium’s exports of goods and services
accounted for 34.5 percent of GDP, whereas total exports of goods and services amounted to 71.7 percent
of GDP. By the metric of value added content of exports, Belgium moves from the 8th largest exporter (out of
58 countries for which data are available) to the 18th.1

Despite its resilience, the economy has been losing competitiveness (Figure 3). Unit
labor costs point to a gradual loss of competitiveness since 2005. Most of this comes from lower
productivity growth, rather than excessive wage growth. Although the overall level of labor
productivity in Belgium is higher than in its three main partner countries (France, Germany, and
Netherlands), the gap has been narrowing. This reflects, in part, measures to increase low-skilled
employment, but productivity growth has been low even in knowledge-intensive sector, which
points to gaps in innovation capacity and education, as well as limited exposure to competition (Box
2). While structural reforms in the energy market since 2012 have contributed to lower energy
prices, the large energy cost differential relative to the United States creates significant competitive
pressures for the energy-intensive Belgian economy. Using the IMF’s External Balance Assessment
(EBA) techniques based on information available as of end–2013, staff assesses that Belgium’s real
exchange rate is overvalued relative to the level consistent with medium-term fundamentals and
desirable policy setting by about 3-8 percent. The cyclically-adjusted current account is weaker than
the level consistent with medium-term economic fundamentals and appropriate domestic and
foreign policies, which EBA regression-based estimates put at a surplus of 1.8 percent of GDP. The
net international investment position remains strong (Figure 2). Gross asset and liability positions,
which grew in the pre-crisis period in connection with the expansion of banks’ balance sheets, have
been shrinking along with bank deleveraging.

Box 2. Non-Cost Competitiveness
Developments in a number of non-cost competitiveness indicators suggest that Belgium could improve its
standing relative to partner countries.


Innovation. While Belgian firms appear to perform well in terms of process innovation, they score
more poorly in terms of product innovation. As such, Belgium’s exports face difficulties in moving
up the value-added chain and, as a result, face increasing competition from emerging markets and
new EU members. R&D spending has been stable in the past decade but is increasingly
concentrated in the pharmaceutical sector, which accounts for a fourth of total R&D spending.
Moreover, Belgium is one of the few advanced countries that had less triadic patents in 2011 than
in 1997. Recognizing the importance of innovation, the government encourages R&D by
subsidizing R&D jobs (9 percent of total labor subsidies), but the effectiveness of this support is
unclear. By contrast the research resources of public universities do not appear to be leveraged as
well as they could in support of private sector innovation.



Education. Building human
capital, notably in science,
should be an essential part of a
strategy to foster innovation.
Compared to its European
peers, Belgium suffers from
fewer students in science and, in
contrast with the experience of
peer countries, student
performance in science has
declined in the last decade.
Regional disparities within
Belgium are also very strong.
Similarly, training of the working
age population is less
developed than in other EU
countries.

Regulatory environment. Competition appears less intense in Belgium than in other European
countries notably because of regulation and administrative burden.1 Belgium ranks 133 out of 144
countries on “burden of government regulation” according to the World Economic Forum; and,
according to the OECD, regulations are significantly more widespread than in other countries.
Building on the success of the recent reforms of the telecommunication and energy sectors, further
liberalization of the services sectors would yield significant gains in terms of productivity and
competitiveness. Regulation in many services sectors undermines total factor productivity growth.
Bourlès et al. (2010) show that Belgium is the European country that would benefit the most from
services sector liberalization (after Poland). They estimate that total factor productivity of the
economy would grow by 1.25 percent more per year over five years if the regulatory burden was
reduced to the best practice in the OECD.2

Public finances are under repair. With structural adjustment of 1.1 percent of GDP
in 2012–13, the deficit is expected to come down to 2.7 percent of GDP in 2013, enabling Belgium to
exit the EU’s Excessive Deficit Procedure. The government’s sale of its 25 percent share in BNPP
Fortis (0.9 percent of GDP) kept the debt ratio just below the 100 percent mark in 2013. Financing
conditions remain favorable, and Belgium has seen its AA/Aa3 ratings confirmed.
6.
Restructuring has reduced the balance sheet of banks, from 410 percent of GDP
in 2008 to 268 percent in 2013Q2 (Figures 4 and 5). Deleveraging has been led by cut backs in
cross-border exposures and sales of foreign subsidiaries. The remaining portfolio of legacy assets
will be unwound gradually. Since mid–2012, improvements in liquidity and solvency have
strengthened banks’ capacity to absorb shocks, while impaired claims have stabilized at 3.8 percent
of total claims. Most banks already comply

asset reduction (83 percent of the improvement) and capital increases (20 percent), mostly from
retained earnings, offset in small part (-3 percent) by an increase in the share of risky assets in total
assets. However, profitability from domestic operations has been weak owing to the combination of
low interest margins and high operating costs.
7.
Ample liquidity from domestic deposits and shedding of foreign assets has enabled
banks to sustain positive credit growth throughout the crisis (Figure 7). Monetary easing by the
European Central Bank (ECB) has been effectively transmitted into lending rates. While overall credit
conditions tightened in 2012 owing to heightened perceptions of credit risk and balance sheet
constraints, they improved slightly in 2013. Banks have continued to channel excess liquidity
generated in Belgium to foreign markets, either by upstreaming liquidity to foreign parent banks or
by funding new foreign lending operations out of Belgium.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
8.
Real GDP is projected to grow by 1.1 percent in 2014, on the back of gradual
improvements in both domestic and external demand. In the absence of deleveraging pressures,
private consumption and investment should be able to respond positively to improved external
conditions, while the negative impulse from fiscal consolidation (0.5 percent of GDP) is expected to
be limited in 2014. But projected growth would still be insufficient to stabilize the unemployment
rate. The reduction of value-added tax (VAT) on energy should keep headline inflation at
1.1 percent, below core inflation.
9.

In the short term, risks to macroeconomic stability are mostly external (Appendix III):



The spillover from protracted low growth in Europe would have durable adverse effects by
raising structural unemployment and making the remaining fiscal adjustment more arduous.



The sovereign-bank nexus could again become a source of vulnerability in the event of renewed
financial stress in Europe, although this risk has diminished as state aid is being repaid, state
guarantees are lapsing, and legacy portfolios are being derisked. Financial stability also
continues to incur risks from incomplete regulatory reform and fragmentation.

10.

Domestic risks are more significant for the medium term outlook:



Failure of structural reforms to keep up with international competitiveness pressures would
undermine growth prospects beyond the recovery and make it much harder to meet fiscal
objectives and create buffers against the looming cost of ageing.



The main financial risk is the ability of banks to maintain adequate capital buffers in the face of
low profitability and possible deterioration in asset quality in a low growth environment.

Exposures to mortgages in Ireland and Hungary, and overall exposures Spain and Italy remain a
risk factor.2 State guarantees to the banking sector remain sizable (12 percent of GDP), but most
of them are related to Dexia, which is in a run-off mode. The realization of financial risks could
also adversely impact the government balance sheet through state owned banks. The Debt
Sustainability Analysis (DSA, Appendix V) illustrates the adverse impact on public finances,
should a part of these guarantees be exercised.


Risks of a sharp correction of real estate prices appear contained. Property prices have risen by
110 percent in real terms since 2000, and, unlike in other EU countries, continued to increase
through the financial crisis. Overvaluation estimates range from 10–60 percent, but valuation
estimates based on price-to-income and price-to-rent ratios often miss catch-up effects. A finer
assessment (interest-adjusted affordability regression analysis) suggests overvaluation of 5–
15 percent. In fact, absolute prices remain moderate by European comparison. High ownership
rates (around 70 percent), coupled with persistent housing shortages, are likely to prevent a
rapid price decline. Robust household balance sheets, the prevalence of fixed interest rate
mortgages, and the recent tightening of capital requirements on mortgage lending should limit
the impact of an interest rate and/or unemployment shocks on the quality of the mortgage
portfolio. However, the prevalence of fixed-rate mortgages shifts the interest rate risk to banks.3

2

Claims on foreign counterparties, such as mortgages in Ireland and Hungary, represent the majority of current
defaults. Exposure of domestically owned banks to Italy and Spain was reduced from EUR 105 billion in 2008 to EUR
21 billion in June 2013.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Discussions focused on the need to activate unused labor resources and reinforce
competitiveness, while anchoring fiscal policy more firmly to medium-term structural
targets. Measures have been taken to correct past slippages in wage costs relative to
partners, but closing the competitiveness gap requires a broader set of structural reforms
to increase productivity and innovation and improve resource allocation. Discussions on
the financial sector centered on the challenges of adjusting the business model of banks
to low structural profitability and changes in the regulatory environment.

A. Raising Productivity, Adaptability, and Activation
11.


The authorities’ structural policies have been guided by two main objectives:

build up over time, but already
employment rates for senior workers have been increasing. A commission has been charged
with preparing pension reform proposals for the next government. The authorities also
underscored the success of job subsidy schemes (amounting to nearly 3.2 percent of total labor
costs) in activating low-skilled workers, for whom the minimum wage (roughly EUR 1,500 a
month) constitutes a barrier to employment. The most developed scheme is the service voucher
system which covers some 109,000 workers, at a budgetary cost of 0.4 percent of GDP in 2011.4
Despite its high cost, the authorities see it as an effective way of promoting durable attachment
to the labor force, all the while preserving the social contract implicit in the minimum wage. The
authorities also pointed to other successful examples of active labor market policies, such as
subsidized apprenticeships. They stressed the desirability of transitioning more generally from
passive support to in-work benefit schemes.

Under the service voucher system, households can purchase vouchers for domestic work from contractual workers
at 60 percent of the minimum wage, with the state (and from 2015 the regions) filling the gap and other costs.

growth in partner countries. In response,
the government took action by: (i)
imposing a real wage freeze in 2013–14; (ii) adjusting the price index, which lowered wage
growth by 0.2 percent; and (iii) reducing energy prices through structural reforms, with a
resulting impact, through indexation, of wage growth. As a result of these measures, the wage
handicap relative to partners was stabilized at 4.8 percent in 2013, and should decline by
1 percentage point in 2014.6 In November 2013, the authorities announced two additional
measures: (i) a commitment to reduce labor taxes by the equivalent of 0.4 percent of GDP over
the next five years; and (ii) a lowering of the VAT rate on electricity from 21 to 6 percent,
effective April 2014, with an estimated impact of 0.4 percent on prices and, through indexation,
on wages. Staff recommended securing the agreement of social partners that labor tax
reductions would go to reducing labor costs rather than increasing wages. Staff also questioned
the merits of lowering the VAT on energy, suggesting that cutting labor taxes would have been
a more efficient way of reducing labor costs.

Notwithstanding these reforms, substantial challenges remain.



Inefficient redistribution mechanisms still create large inactivity traps and disincentives to
work. Belgium’s social model produces the largest degree of redistribution in the OECD.7
However, in the process it also creates widespread inactivity traps. Beyond the pension reform,
staff stressed the scope for increasing further work incentives by reducing interruption of career
schemes and exemptions from job search requirements.



Wage formation could be improved. While the 1996 law on competitiveness has worked
reasonably well in generating consensus around competitive wage setting, the authorities
agreed that automatic corrections for past deviations from the norm should be made more
explicit. Staff also recommended introducing corrections for observed deviations in labor
productivity growth (not only wages), and removing terms-of trade effects from the indexation
mechanisms.



The labor market should be made more adaptable. Labor market arrangements have been
designed to protect existing jobs through lengthy and costly dismissal procedures. The system
was reformed in 2013 to eliminate differences in treatment between blue collar and white collar
workers, but it remains costly and staff underscored the adverse effect on hiring, labor mobility,
and the ability of enterprises to adjust. It suggested that these resources would be better used
by developing new labor market skills through in-work training, where Belgium lags behind
other countries. Labor mobility would also be enhanced by strengthening job search
requirements and reducing tax impediments to relocation.



More efficient product markets are needed as a complement to a more adaptable labor
market. Regulation and administrative burdens appear more cumbersome in Belgium than in
other European countries. As a result, competition, notably in the non-tradable sector, is less
intense and productivity gains are lower (and even negative for some services). A liberalization
of product markets, combined with measures to foster innovation and improve education, would
raise Belgium’s potential growth. Liberalization could be most effective in services sectors such
as transport industries, retail distribution, and professional services, which are heavily regulated
by OECD standards. Greater competition in product markets would create new job opportunities
and thereby reinforce activation policies. Such liberalization would also complement the 2013
reform of the competition authority that increases its capacity to sanction anti-competitive
practices.

B. A More Strategic Approach to Fiscal Adjustment
13.
Structural fiscal adjustment of 3.3 percent of GDP is still required to meet the
authorities’ medium-term structural surplus objective of 0.75 percent of GDP.8 The targeted
surplus would place the debt ratio on a path consistent with EU commitments and create fiscal
space for the looming cost of ageing. The April 2013 Stability Program envisioned reaching this
objective in 2016. Meeting this target date would require an acceleration of adjustment by the
federal and regional governments relative to the structural adjustment projected in 2014 under
current policies (0.5 percent of GDP).
14.
Staff took the view that average structural adjustment of 0.75 percent a year would be
appropriate going forward given the risks highlighted by the DSA. Staff emphasized the
8

15

BELGIUM

importance of steady quality adjustment over a specific target date for reaching the surplus
objective. Average adjustment of 0.75 percent would be consistent with the gradual and limited
increase in revenues over the next five years (1 percent of GDP, similar to the 2013 Stability
Program) and real expenditure growth of 0.5 percent a year, which could be achieved through
structural spending reforms. Since consolidation measures beyond 2014 are yet to be identified, and
given the uncertainty over the regional governments pace of adjustment (see below), the staff’s
baseline scenario presented in the tables assumes a more modest pace of structural adjustment of
about 0.5 percent per year, which would see Belgium achieving its medium-term fiscal objective only
in 2019. The DSA illustrates that public finances, under this baseline scenario, remain fragile, and
even modest changes in the economic environment would push the public debt ratio above
100 percent. A negative growth shock and realization of contingent fiscal liabilities coming from
bank support represent major risks to the debt outlook.
15.
Staff stressed the importance for the post-election government to identify upfront the
sources of medium-term adjustment. Given that most of the structural adjustment to date has
come from revenue measures, staff underscored the need to rebalance consolidation toward
expenditure measures (Figure 8). For the federal government, this implies reducing current spending
and rationalizing subsidies and social transfers, consistent with activation objectives (Figure 9). On
the tax side, there was broad agreement that planned reductions in labor taxes should be integrated
in a comprehensive tax shift toward indirect, environmental, and capital income taxation—income
from capital is subject to different and favorable tax regimes relative to labor income.
16.
With responsibility for roughly ⅓ of the remaining adjustment need, regional and
community governments will have to take decisive actions (Box 3). The pace at which regional
governments will adjust has yet to be agreed, but the enhanced competencies of regional
governments under the sixth reform of the state provide scope for both revenue and expenditure
measures. For regional governments, staff noted that adjustment should focus on current spending
and tax expenditures so as to preserve fiscal space for productivity-enhancing spending in
education and transport infrastructure, where growing bottlenecks are undermining productivity
(Figure 10).
17.
Adapting to the requirements of the EU Fiscal Compact creates opportunities for more
efficient policies but also challenges in Belgium’s complex fiscal structure. Given the
considerable degree of decentralization and the fact that the federal, regional, and community
governments have equal standing before the law, the requirements of the Fiscal Compact have
taken the form of a cooperation agreement between the various governments, backed by a stronger
assessment and monitoring role for the High Council of Finance. Moving to structural targets should
reduce reliance on pro-cyclical stop gap measures in pursuit of annual nominal deficit targets, which
have characterized recent budget executions. However, defining and monitoring structural targets
for regional governments will be challenging. Staff proposed setting nominal deficit targets with
cyclical adjustors for revenues to correct for cyclical effects.

Box 3. Sixth Reform of the State and Burden Sharing of Fiscal Adjustment
The Sixth Reform of the State, negotiated in October 2011, substantially increased the degree of fiscal
federalism by devolving additional spending responsibilities to subnational governments and reforming
their funding. The state reform was finalized in December 2013, when the parliament passed the revised
Special Finance Act governing the financing of the federated entities. The reform will enter into force in
July 2014, and the new financing rules will begin to be applied in 2015. The decentralized responsibilities,
which should amount to nearly 5 percent of GDP in 2015, are discussed in Box 2 of Belgium’s 2011 Article IV
Staff Report.1 The adjustment burden is redistributed towards Regions and Communities in the following
way:


New spending responsibilities are not fully covered by increased tax autonomy and new transfers. Tax
autonomy of Regions2 will increase as they acquire responsibility for around 25 percent of the
personal income tax (2.9 percent of GDP), which means that the share of own taxes in the regions’
total revenue will increase from 43.9 percent to 73.3 percent. Regions will be able to set their own
income tax rates, brackets, and tax exemptions. Additional funding will be provided by new federal
grants (1.3 percent of GDP) and new traffic related revenue (0.2 percent of GDP). Overall, total new
resources of Regions and Communities will increase by 4.4 percent of GDP in 2015. The residual gap
of about 0.6 percent of GDP as of 2016, relative to new spending commitments, will be the Regions
and Communities’ contribution to fiscal consolidation.



Additional adjustment of 0.4 percent of GDP over the medium term. Firstly, Regions and Communities
will contribute to the budgetary cost of aging, in the form of decreased indexation of some grants
to economic growth from 2017 onwards (for example, transfers related to labor market policies will
grow by only 55 percent of economic growth rather than the current 75 percent). This measure
should reduce federal transfers to Regions and Communities by 0.2 percent of GDP by 2030.
Secondly, the Regions and Communities will gradually increase their contribution to their civil
servants’ pension plans, which are currently fully paid by the federal government. This contribution
will increase steadily to 8.86 percent of wages in 2030 (0.2 percent of GDP).



Redistribution between the regions will also be scaled back. The national solidarity allowance, which
redistributes proceeds from the federal income tax based on regional per capita income, will be
scaled, back providing savings of 0.1 percent of GDP for the federal government. The redistribution
grant will compensate for 80 percent of the difference in per capita income relative to the national
average, down from the current 100 percent.

C. Financial Sector: from Deleveraging to Reforming Business Models
18.
The main challenge for banks is to move from balance sheet repair to adjustment of
their business models in the face of low profitability and regulatory changes. The authorities
considered that the risks from legacy assets were manageable, while recognizing that their very long
shelf life called for prolonged monitoring. A revival of economic growth should help bank
profitability, but the authorities noted that the primary instrument of adjustment should be more
aggressive cuts in operating expenses. Stronger profitability would, in turn, facilitate compliance
with more stringent solvency rules under Basel III. To monitor these challenges, and in line with FSAP
recommendations, the supervisor has stepped up its monitoring of banks’ business models and the
profitability of specific business lines. The authorities indicated that consolidation within the
overbanked system might also be needed at some stage. A fundamental regulatory challenge will
come from the changes in the financial architecture embedded in the new banking law which the
government expects Parliament to approve before the May elections.
19.
The forthcoming banking law is the cornerstone of the government’s strategy to
safeguard financial stability (Box 4). The reform of the banking law in Belgium—agreed by the
government in December 2013 and expected to be passed by parliament by spring this year—has
been motivated by the need to equip Belgium with a reinforced framework to deal with bank
failures that limit the likelihood and size of taxpayer-funded bailouts. To this end, the law would
restrain trading activities and improve the recovery and resolution framework within the perimeter
allowed by the EU Bank Resolution and Recovery Directive, including by reinforcing depositor
protection. In drafting the law, the authorities carefully balanced possible competitive distortions
that may arise from front running EU legislation against the need to take swift action to protect
financial stability and public finances. Key elements affecting the recovery and resolution framework,
particularly the bail in provisions, will therefore remain contingent on forthcoming EU agreements in
this area. While acknowledging that banks could circumvent limits on risky trading by migrating
such activities to less-regulated jurisdictions, the authorities noted that the law should permit banks
to continue operating as universal banks: trading activities beneficial to the real economy would still
be permitted, and thresholds triggering additional capital requirements were prudent but not overly
constraining.
20.
At the shorter horizon, banks seem overall well positioned for the ECB comprehensive
assessment which may nevertheless cast doubts on the viability of specific business lines.
Because risk profiles differ across banks in terms of exposure to legacy assets, problematic foreign
mortgage markets, and public sector lending, asset quality problems in a specific loan class could
have uneven repercussions within the banking system. Loss absorption capacity also differs across
banks, and some have increased provisions ahead of the ECB’s asset quality review.
21.
Recent measures by the National Bank of Belgium (NBB) to reduce risk from mortgage
portfolios are timely and appropriate. The NBB has enhanced its supervisory scrutiny of mortgage
risks and has raised the risk weights for domestic mortgages by 5 percentage points above the
banks’ own internal risk weighting models. The authorities presented this measure as mostly

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BELGIUM

preemptive and motivated by the risks of continued upward pressures on housing prices. Loan
impairment of domestic mortgages (around 15 percent of the consolidated balance sheet) remains
low and the latest vintages of mortgage loans do not show any increase in default rates. Still, there
are pockets of vulnerability, with 10 percent of mortgages combining loan-to-value ratios of over
90 percent with debt service ratios of over 50 percent.
22.
Reform of taxation of savings to remove current distortions has proven controversial.
The tax advantage granted to bank savings accounts has contributed to the strong liquidity position
of banks.9 However, it also distorts financial intermediation. In order to create a level-playing field
and encourage the reallocation of short-term saving toward longer-term instruments, the
authorities proposed extending the tax benefit to all financial instruments. By capping it at the
current level, the measure would be revenue neutral; and by phasing it gradually, it would not
disrupt banks’ operations. Such a proposal is consistent with past staff advice, but it has
encountered public and political opposition, in part because it would increase the reporting
requirements of financial institutions to the tax authority.

9

The combination of declining interest rates and a high cap on the amount of interest income (EUR 1,880 in 2013)
that is exempt from taxes has resulted in a massive shift of saving toward savings accounts.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BELGIUM

Box 4. The Draft Banking Law
Consistent with FSAP advice and the EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive, the new draft banking law
seeks to improve the recovery and resolution frameworks, reduce contagion from risky trading activities to
retail banking, and reinforce depositor protection. The draft law described below could still undergo changes
as it goes through parliamentary approval.

1



Trading activities. The draft law bans banks from proprietary trading while allowing trading operations
deemed beneficial for the real economy.1 Trading activities will be limited to 15 percent of the balance
sheet or 10 percent of the regulatory capital; and subject to capital surcharges beyond those
thresholds. Forbidden trading activities have to be transferred to a separate entity. The approach
toward trading appears to be closer to the Volcker rule (United States), as it defines the perimeter for
permissible trading activities that can be preserved by deposit-taking entities, as opposed to the
Vickers reforms (United Kingdom) and the EU Barnier’s proposal, which opt for separating all trading
activities except those strictly necessary for the banks’ treasury functions.



Recovery and resolution framework. The law would require all domestic financial institutions to have
recovery and resolution plans. The resolution framework would be enhanced by: (i) recognizing the
National Bank as the resolution authority and, in compliance with the EU Banking Recovery and
Resolution Directive, empowering it with more flexible instruments to resolve ailing banks (selling part
or all of a failing bank to another bank, using bridge institutions to manage good assets, and
separating assets via asset management vehicles to clean banks’ balance sheets); (ii) speeding up
judiciary decisions to resolve banks; and (iii) extending to all banks the requirement to submit strategic
decisions for regulatory approval.



Depositor protection. The banking law would establish depositor preference over unsecured creditors
for all deposits eligible for coverage by the deposit guarantee scheme. To ensure deposit preference
in case of bank failure, banks are required to provide information on asset encumbrance in their
recovery plans. The level of asset encumbrance will be monitored regularly and assessed against bankspecific thresholds set by the regulator to reflect their risk profile. Failure to comply with preestablished thresholds will trigger corrective action.



Macro-prudential policies. The draft law designates the National Bank of Belgium (NBB) as the macroprudential authority, with responsibility for detection and monitoring of systemic risks, and powers to
make recommendations to the relevant authorities if systemic risks emerge ("act or explain"). The NBB
would have an array of macro-prudential instruments at its disposal (e.g. additional capital and
liquidity requirements, new disclosures, limits on concentration risks, leverage ratio, limitation on
dividends, different valuation of collateral). The federal government would retain responsibility for
setting limits on loan-to-value and debt-to-income ratios, but the NBB would have the power to make
recommendations to the government on the use of these instruments.

Permissible trading activities include financial services provided to clients and the hedging of these transactions, market making

activities, hedging and liquidity risk management operations, and long-term investment transactions.

STAFF APPRAISAL
23.
With financial stability risks receding, strengthening growth performance emerges as
the critical challenge for Belgium. Since taking office, the government has taken decisive
measures to restore financial stability and improve economic performance, but substantial
challenges remain in terms of activating underused labor resources and improving competitiveness.
Growth impediments reflect the interaction of labor and product market rigidities as well as
distortions from inefficient social policies. A comprehensive policy approach of mutually reinforcing
measures is needed to address these impediments, and enable the economy to better adapt and
compete in existing and new high productivity sectors. Failing that, Belgium faces the prospect of
having to adjust wages even more aggressively to compete on prices in traditional sectors.
24.
Continued wage moderation and, even more importantly, structural reforms to
improve resource allocation and productivity are needed to restore competitiveness. Labor
market institutions should be focused on promoting labor mobility and adaptability, including
through life-time training, rather than protecting existing jobs through costly layoff procedures. In
product markets, eliminating barriers to competition would promote innovation and productivity,
and lightening the heavy burden of regulation would free resources for more productive uses. In this
regard, a new cooperation framework would help improve coordination among the various levels of
government that have complementary responsibilities for economic and social policies. Public
resources could be leveraged more effectively in support of private R&D, notably through public
universities, and educational reform appears urgent in view of poor educational outcomes. Wage
setting institutions have proven to be adaptable to external challenges over time, but they should be
strengthened by ensuring more timely correction for deviations in wage and productivity trends
relative to partners.
25.
In combination with greater product and labor market flexibility, a shift of public
resources from passive to active labor market policies would help raise employment rates.
Considerable growth is foregone because of Belgium’s structurally low employment rate, which in
turn puts additional stress on the social security system. Pension reform should focus on
lengthening working life. But a broader reform of social policies is needed to eliminate inactivity
traps and incentives to withdraw from the labor force. Such reforms should be phased in as demand
recovers and also accompanied by an expansion of active labor market policies. In-work benefits,
such as the service voucher system, can be an effective instrument of activation within the constraint
of the minimum wage. However, significant savings have to be generated from reforming passive
support measures to cover the cost of such policies.
26.
High debt calls for continued steady fiscal adjustment which should be rebalanced
from tax measures to structural spending reforms. Annual structural adjustment of
0.75 percentage points would balance the need to rebuild fiscal space, not least because of the
looming costs of ageing, against the risks from the hesitant recovery. This pace of adjustment

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21

BELGIUM

should be achieved by containing expenditure growth, so as to limit the need for new revenue
measures. Fiscal effort should focus on reducing current spending, subsidies, and transfers, thus
preserving space for growth enhancing spending on labor activation and public infrastructure. On
the tax side, planned reductions in labor taxes should be integrated into a comprehensive tax shift,
away from labor income toward indirect taxes (e.g., VAT), environmental taxes, and taxes on income
from capital. The announced reduction of VAT on electricity goes in the opposite direction, and
should at some point be replaced by lower labor taxes.
27.
Adapting to the requirements of the EU fiscal compact creates an opportunity to
improve the efficiency of fiscal policy. In particular, the move to structural deficit targets should
reduce the need for repeated stop gap measures which have characterized the budgetary process.
However, this reform is made more challenging by the fact that it coincides with further fiscal
decentralization and a reallocation of the adjustment toward regional governments. Extending the
fiscal governance framework to all levels of government will therefore require defining individual
fiscal objectives that adequately capture structural effort.
28.
Bank restructuring has reduced financial vulnerabilities, but banks still need to adapt
to an evolving operating and regulatory environment. Risks associated with legacy assets have
declined markedly, but the fact that the remaining portfolio will be unwound very gradually calls for
continued close oversight. Risks going forward are mostly related to low profit margins and thus the
ability to meet more stringent capital requirements under Basel III. This calls for further cost cutting
measures on part of the banks and continued regular monitoring of banks’ business models, as they
adapt to the evolving regulatory environment and the opportunities created by the lapsing of state
aid conditionality. The draft banking law now in parliament should help safeguard financial stability
by strengthening the resolution framework and limiting trading activities, while preserving the
universal banking model of Belgian banks. Supervision has been strengthened in line with FSAP
recommendations, and the tightening of capital requirements on mortgage lending is a welcome
preventive measure against the risks of a further outrunning of real estate prices relative to incomes.
29.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Belgium take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

Appendix I. Main Recommendations of the 2013 Article IV
Consultation and Authorities’ Response
Fund Recommendations

Policy Actions Taken
Fiscal Policy

Maintain a steady pace of fiscal
adjustment based on structural
targets to reduce vulnerabilities.

Structural adjustment of 0.8 percent of GDP achieved in 2013.

Adopt a clear rule-based multi-year
fiscal policy framework, which
would ensure adequate burdensharing across all levels of
government and consistency with
overall fiscal targets.

Requirements of EU Fiscal Compact adopted into law, with
emphasis on medium-term structural targets. Agreement on
burden sharing with regional governments reached in mid–2013

Financial Sector Policy
Strengthen banks’ capital buffers in
line with Basel III requirements and
review regularly the viability of
banks’ business models.

The 2013 and 2014 Annual Risk Reviews focus on the evaluation
of banks’ business models. Recent measures taken by the NBB to
strengthen capital buffers include limits on dividends and the
reduction of specific activities.

Strengthen the national resolution
and deposit insurance frameworks.

New draft banking law before parliament (Box 4).

Reform taxation of financial income
to reduce bias in favor of shortterm deposits and to promote
long-term saving regardless of the
underlying financial instruments.

Discussions are ongoing to extend the tax exemption on income
from savings deposits’ income to other financial instruments, but
no agreement has yet been reached.

Structural Reforms
Phase out wage indexation and
strengthen the link between
domestic wage developments and
those in partner countries, while
providing flexibility to correct for
past deviations.

Consensus reached with social partners on need for continued
wage moderation in order to close the wage gap relative to
partners, estimated at 4.8 percent in 2013.

Enact additional pension and social
policy reforms, consistent with
fiscal consolidation objectives, in
order to raise the effective age of
retirement and employment rates.

High level commission established to prepare pension reform
recommendations for the next government.

Appendix II. FSAP Recommendations
Policy Action

Timing

Status

Overall Financial Stability Oversight
Formalize procedures and
improve information exchange
between the NBB and the
Financial Services and Markets
Authority (FSMA).

Immediate

Done. A Memorandum of Understanding was signed in 2013,
which provides for information sharing procedures as well as
enhanced dialogue through regular meetings at the
technical, senior, and board levels.

Make stress testing a routine
tool within the macro-financial
policy and surveillance
framework.

Short term

Ongoing. Stress tests will be conducted in collaboration with
the ECB/EBA as part of the forthcoming asset quality review.
The NBB has started collecting granular data needed for
credit risk assessment (loss given default and probability of
default).

Enhance further stress testing
of insurers using a market
consistent valuation framework.

Short term

Partly done. Establishment of interim measures for Solvency
II including Own Risk and Solvency Assessment, reporting
requirements, governance, and pre-application of internal
models.

Complete the ongoing
business model reviews for
both banks and insurance
companies and develop a
strategy for both sectors over
the medium term.

Short term

Partly done. The 2013 and 2014 Annual Risk Reviews (ARR)
examine the viability of banks' business models. The 2013
ARR focuses on interest margins, profitability drivers, and
credit risks by activity lines. The 2014 ARR will broaden the
scope of the analysis to market activities, asset liability
management, etc. and perform a full vulnerability analysis for
insurance companies.

Develop an explicit
conglomerates supervision
framework and ensure
consistent application of
governance requirements
across financial conglomerates.

Medium
term

Partly done. The banking law will integrate conglomerate
supervision into banking supervision (for banking-led
conglomerates) This will allow the NBB to give full pillar 2
treatment (including all governance rules) to conglomerates.
Ongoing work to tailor the supervisory framework to
conglomerate-specific risks will be adjusted next year to
comply with EU guidelines on risk-concentration in financial
conglomerates and intragroup transactions in financial
conglomerates. To provide effective supervision, the NBB will
closely monitor multiple leveraging, ensure the systematic
reporting of intra-group transactions and risk concentrations
(as mandated by the Financial Conglomerates Directive), and
finalize and apply consistently insurance and securities
scorecarding systems (2014 ARR).

Designate the NBB as the
macroprudential authority,
ensuring a regular dialogue
with FSMA and Ministry of
Finance (MoF) on

Medium
term

Done. The banking law designates the NBB as the macroprudential authority. As such, the NBB will be responsible for
the detection and monitoring of systemic risks and for
following up on any related recommendations from
international organizations (IIOO); and vested with powers to

40

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BELGIUM

ask for corrective measures to the relevant authorities ("act
or explain"). The NBB is currently revamping the framework
for the detection of systemic risks and will count on a wide
range of instruments to encourage effective action (e.g.
additional capital and liquidity requirements, new disclosures,
limits on concentration risks, leverage ratio, limitation on
dividends, different valuation of collateral). Specific limits
related to loan-to-value and debt-to-income ratios will be
the responsibility of the federal government, but the NBB will
make recommendations on the use of these instruments
whenever risks appear in the real estate sector.

macroprudential and financial
stability matters.

Banking Regulation and Supervision
Review supervisory processes
and calibrate intensity and
resource allocation based on
institutions' risk profiles,
particularly for smaller
institutions.

Short term

Done. Supervisory processes have been strengthened along
a number of dimensions (clustering exercises, resource
allocation based on risks' profiles also for smaller institutions,
etc.) The NBB's supervisory framework is adjusting to SSM
requirements, particularly the adoption of a uniform
supervision scorecard. Up to 20 additional positions will be
created within the NBB to support supervisory tasks.

Embed engagement with bank
and insurance boards in the
supervisory process in a
systematic way.

Short term

Partly done. The NBB Board holds regular meetings with
bank and insurance boards.

Empower the NBB to preapprove a major acquisition by
a credit institution.

Medium
term

Done. The banking law (2014Q1) includes a provision for this
purpose and the notion of strategic decisions for Belgian DSIBs will be broadened to include any changes in banks'
operations that could potentially impact on resolvability.

Maintain current liquidity
regulatory regime until Basel III
Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR)
is fully adopted and phased in
at the European level.

Ongoing

Done. To avoid liquidity cliff effects due to the
implementation of the EU capital requirements regulation,
the NBB will require all Belgian credit institutions and
financial holding companies to stick to the 100 percent LCR
during 2015–18 (phase in period for the adoption of a full
LCR under the CRR).

Insurance Regulation and Supervision
Formulate a baseline prudential
supervisory program for
insurers and risk-based
conduct-of-business
supervision of insurers and
intermediaries.

Short term

Partly done. The 2014 ARR will refine the existing
scorecarding approach towards supervision. Technical
provisions will be monitored on a regular basis and methods
used by insurance companies to compute technical
provisions will be challenged (through dedicated on-site
inspections). Supervisory staff for insurance companies will
be increased by 6 additional positions and the effectiveness
of external auditors and actuaries will be improved (licenses
will be granted upon successful performance in specialized
exams). A law was passed on July 30, 2013 to extend the
Markets in Financial Instruments Directive risk-based

conduct-of-business rules to insurance companies (entry into
force as of January 1, 2014).
Align findings of insurance
stress testing with contingency
planning in the context of the
recovery and resolution
framework.

Short term

Partly done. European Insurance and Occupational Pensions
Authority-led stress tests will be conducted this year (in
continuation of the long-term guarantee impact assessment
conducted in 2013). The Own Risk and Solvency Assessment
regime will also be used to assess the solvency needs of
insurance companies in view of their risk profiles.

Implement elements of
Solvency II, including an Own
Risk and Solvency Assessment
regime.

Medium
term

Partly done. Measures were adopted to improve the quality
of the calculation of the Solvency II balance sheet and capital
requirements (Own Risk and Solvency Assessment Regime,
reporting requirements, governance, and pre-applications of
internal models). The NBB will require insurance companies
to provide additional information in 2014H1 for the
computation of the solvency capital requirement.

Empower the NBB to take
immediate recovery measures
notwithstanding an appeal by
the insurer.

Medium
term

Unaddressed. This recommendation will be addressed in the
context of the transposition of the Solvency II regime.

Securities Markets Supervision
Medium
term

Establish an Emerging Risk
Committee at the FSMA and
formalize framework for
detecting and monitoring
emerging risks.

Partly done. The IOSCO Thematic Review on the
Implementation of Principles 6 and 7 of the International
Organization of Securities Commissions Objectives and
Principles of Securities Regulation (March 2013) found that
the FSMA had made significant efforts to implement these
principles. The FSMA is now consulting with other European
securities regulators to exchange views on the framework for
detecting and monitoring risks.

Crisis Management and Resolution Framework
Formalize domestic coordination
arrangements for the financial
safety net participants via a crisis
management memorandum of
understanding and the
establishment of a crossinstitutional coordination group.

Short term

Unaddressed. In the context of the banking union,
coordination arrangements for safety nets will integrate
resolution authorities at the both national (NBB) and EU
levels (Single Resolution Mechanism and Single Supervisory
Mechanism).

Request recovery and resolution
plans (RRPs) for all domestic
systemically important firms.

Short term

Done. The forthcoming banking law will request RRPs for all
domestic financial institutions.

Grant NBB an explicit mandate
as the resolution authority.

Medium
term

Done. NBB's mandate as a resolution authority will be
embedded in the forthcoming banking law.

Improve the bank resolution

Medium

Partly done. The forthcoming banking law will reinforce the

42

BELGIUM

toolkit by reducing ex ante
procedural requirements,
extending the framework to all
banks, and enhancing powers
for special inspectors

term

crisis management toolkit by speeding up of judiciary
decisions to resolve failing banks, requiring NBB's opinion on
the designation of the administrator and ex ante approval in
the event of bank liquidation. EU agreements on bail in rules
will be transposed to national legislation by royal decree at a
later stage.

Revamp the deposit guarantee
scheme, establish ex ante fund
and depositor preference.

Medium
term

Partly done. The banking law would establish depositor
preference over unsecured creditors. To this end, the
regulator would be tasked with setting, for each bank, a floor
on unencumbered assets which would be available to cover
uninsured depositors in the event of a bank failure. Deposit
guarantee schemes have not been reformed.

Appendix III. Risk Assessment Matrix
Source of Risk

Protracted period of slower
European growth (larger
than expected deleveraging,
or negative surprise on
potential growth)

Financial stress in the euro
area re-emerges (triggered
by stalled or incomplete
delivery of national and euro
area policy commitments)

Risks to financial stability
from incomplete
regulatory reforms (delays,
dilution of reform, or
inconsistent approaches)
Housing price correction

Political risk or lack of
consensus on structural
reforms

44

Relative Likelihood and
channel of transmission
High
Strong impact through trade
channel

Medium
The extent to which financial stress
in the euro area would spread to
Belgium (and cause it to delink
from the euro area core) depends
on the nature of the shock. On the
positive side, Belgium has limited
direct exposures to Greece, and
Portugal, its domestic banks are in
a stronger position than in 2011,
and despite high debt Belgium has
market credibility owing to proven
ability to consolidate. On the
negative side, sovereign banking
interdependence remains high.

Impact if Realized
High
The growth impact of lower external
demand would, over time, translate into
higher structural unemployment and
thus complicate further fiscal adjustment.
Policy response: coordinated fiscal policy
response at European level to support
demand where fiscal space is available.
Medium
Impact would be greatest if source of
stress came from bank asset quality
concerns, as it could reactivate the
sovereign-banking nexus.
Policy response: euro area monetary
policy is first line of defense against
liquidity stress, backed by adequate
backstop and resolution institutions.

Medium
Belgium has been proactive in
implementing reforms but it
remains vulnerable to the lack of
sufficient coordination within the
EU and euro area.

Medium
Banks could be adversely affected by
regulatory fragmentation.
Policy response: accelerated conversion of
regulatory approaches within the EU,
towards banking union.

Medium
Housing overvaluation estimates
are in the 10–60 percent range
based on price-to-income and
price-to-rent ratios, but finer
regression analysis points to
overvaluation of 5-15 percent.

Low
Price adjustment expected to be gradual,
with limited impact on banks owing to
sound lending standards.
Policy response: capital requirements on
mortgages recently increased; additional
macro-prudential measures could be
introduced if necessary.
High
Failure to close competitiveness gap,
improve the efficiency of public
spending, and continue structural
reforms would dampen growth and
make fiscal adjustment more arduous.

Medium
Difficulty in implementing
structural reforms and correcting
cost and non-cost handicap.
Fiscal adjustment lags or is driven
by opportunistic (and inefficient)
tax and expenditure measures.

Appendix V. Debt Sustainability Analysis
Public debt sustainability risks remain high. Under the baseline scenario, the public debt-to-GDP
ratio is projected to peak at 99.9 percent in 2014 and to decline to 90.4 percent by 2019 as the fiscal
deficit narrows and economic recovery gains traction. Gross financing needs are estimated at
18 percent of GDP in 2014 and are expected to remain around 14–18 percent in the medium term.
The projected decline in public debt remains fragile, and even modest changes in the economic
environment would rapidly push the public debt ratio above 100 percent. In particular, a negative
growth shock and realization of contingent fiscal liabilities coming from bank support represent
major risks to the debt outlook.
Baseline and Realism of Projections
Slow but steady fiscal consolidation under the baseline scenario and economic recovery result in a
gradual decline in the public debt ratio over the medium term, while the gross financing need
remains broadly unchanged.


Macroeconomic assumptions. Growth is estimated at 0.2 percent in 2013, rising to 1.1 percent
in 2014 on the back of a rebound in foreign and domestic demand. The output gap narrows
over the medium term, but is still projected to be slightly negative in 2019, owing to the slow
recovery of demand. Inflation is projected to stay well below 2 percent throughout the period,
reflecting the negative output gap and the ongoing real wage freeze in the private sector.



Fiscal outlook. In staff’s baseline projections, the general government deficit comes down from
4.0 percent of GDP in 2012 to 0.1 percent in 2018. A modest surplus is expected from 2019
onwards. The primary surplus is projected to strengthen over the medium term, from 0.4 percent
of GDP in 2013 to 3.9 percent of GDP in 2018. The projected pace of fiscal consolidation
achieves the authorities’ structural surplus of 0.75 percent only in 2019. However, consolidation
measures past 2014 are yet to be identified.



Debt levels and gross financing needs. Belgium’s high level of government debt and gross
financing requirement calls for using the higher scrutiny framework.1 Government gross debt
has increased significantly since 2007, reflecting sizable fiscal stimulus, declining real and
nominal growth, and a large recapitalization of (and financial support to) the banking sector.
Public debt reached 99.8 percent of GDP in 2012 and is projected to stay just below the
100 percent mark in 2014. Gross financing needs are estimated at 18 percent of GDP in 2014
and are expected to remain around 14–18 percent in the medium term.

1

For advanced economies that (i) have a current or projected debt-to-GDP ratio above 60 percent; or (ii) have
current or projected gross financing needs-to-GDP ratio above 15 percent; or (iii) have or are seeking exceptional
access to Fund resources; teams are required to use an extended set of tools to identify and assess specific risks to
debt sustainability. For these “higher scrutiny” cases, teams are also required to produce a standardized summary of
risks in a heat map and prepare a write-up to discuss risks, including any country-specific considerations.



Realism of baseline assumptions. The median forecast error for real GDP growth
during 2004−12 is 0.2 percent, suggesting that there is a slight downward bias in the staff
projections. Similarly, the median forecast error for inflation (GDP deflator) is 0.2 percent,
suggesting that the staff forecasts have under-estimated inflation. The median forecast error
for primary balance suggests that staff projections have been slightly optimistic (a forecast
bias of -0.1 percent of GDP), but the forecast bias is in line with other surveillance countries
and have improved during the later years. Given the openness of Belgium’s economy, fiscal
multipliers in Belgium are relatively low, with estimates ranging between 0.1−0.5. This conforms
to rule-of-thumb methods for assessing fiscal multipliers.2 Thus fiscal consolidation in the staff’s
baseline scenario is not expected to have a large impact on growth.



Cross-country experience suggests the projected fiscal adjustment is feasible. The
maximum 3­year adjustment in the cyclically-adjusted primary balance (CAPB) over the
projection period (2 percent of GDP) is ambitious but Belgium was able to deliver impressive
fiscal consolidation in the past. However, staff does not rule out the existence of implementation
risks and therefore a constant primary balance scenario is presented to illustrate this risk.



Heat map. Risks from the debt level are deemed high given that the relevant threshold to which
Belgium’s values are compared is 85 percent and this threshold is breached under baseline and
all stress test scenarios. Similarly, Belgium’s gross financing needs under most stress test
scenarios exceed the benchmark of 20 percent of GDP. Belgium also faces risks relating to its
external financing requirement and a large share of public debt held by foreigners. At
127 percent, the external financing requirement is significantly above the upper threshold of
early warning benchmarks and the share of debt held by foreigners is relatively high at about
47 percent of total.

Shocks and Stress Tests
The DSA framework suggests Belgium’s government debt-to-GDP ratio remains below 110 percent
and its gross financing needs remain below 30 percent of GDP under different macroeconomic and
fiscal shocks.


Growth shock. Under this scenario, real output growth rates are lower by one standard
deviation starting in 2014–15, i.e. 1.8 percentage points relative to the baseline scenario. The
assumed decline in growth leads to lower inflation (0.25 percentage points per 1 percentage
point decrease in GDP growth) while interest rates are assumed to increase 25 basis points for
every 1 percent of GDP worsening in the primary balance. Under this scenario, the debt-to-GDP
ratio increases to 106.6 percent of GDP in 2016 and declines thereafter.

2

The rule-of-thumb estimate is based on recent work by FAD and EUR, “Guidance Note for Desks on Fiscal
Multipliers,” which suggests that Belgium’s fiscal multiplier is in the low range (0.1-0.3) given its openness and high
public debt.



High interest rate scenario. This scenario examines the implications for debt sustainability of
an increase in spreads by 200 basis points throughout the projection period. The deterioration
of public debt and gross financing needs are back-loaded as old debt gradually matures and
new higher interest rate debt is contracted. In 2019, the impact on financing needs is 1.3 percent
of GDP. Debt dynamics remain favorable, but the debt ratio would be 2.0 percentage points
higher than in the baseline by 2019.



Real exchange rate shock. This scenario assumes 15 percent devaluation in the real exchange
rate in 2014. This shock results in a slight decrease in debt and gross financing needs ratios
through the inflation channel.



Primary balance shock. This scenario examines the implications of a revenue shock and a rise
in interest rates leading to a cumulative 2.3 percentage points of GDP deterioration in the
primary balance (one standard deviation shock). The combined shocks leads to a deterioration in
the debt ratio of 2.5 percentage points relative to the baseline in 2019 and slightly higher gross
financing needs.



Combined macro-fiscal scenario. This scenario aggregates shocks to real growth, the interest
rate, the exchange rate, and the primary balance while taking care not to double-count the
effects of individual shocks. Under this scenario, debt would reach 108 percent of GDP in 2016
and remaining above 100 percent of GDP until 2019. The impact on financing needs would be
significant, raising them to an average of 20 percent of GDP in 2015–19.



Recommended fiscal scenario. This scenario illustrates the debt and gross financing need
paths consistent with the staff’s recommended average structural effort of 0.75 percent of GDP a
year until the medium-term surplus objective is reached in 2019. This scenario is consistent with
the gradual and limited increase in revenues over the next five years underlying the 2013
Stability Program (1 percent of GDP in all), and real expenditure growth of 0.5 percent a year,
which could be achieved through structural spending reforms. Under this scenario, the debt
ratio falls to 88 percent of GDP in 2019, with lower financing needs throughout the forecast
period.



Backtracking on fiscal consolidation. This scenario captures political and fiscal consolidation
risks associated with the post–2014 election period. It assumes some fiscal slippage in 2014
(0.3 percent of GDP), and no new consolidation measures for three post-election years (2015–
17), with the tax-to-GDP ratio constant at the 2014 level and real primary expenditure growing
at 1.5 percent per year, consistently with the experience of 2011, when Belgium was under a
caretaker government. The scenario illustrates that backtracking on fiscal consolidation would
result in public debt remaining elevated at about 100 percent of GDP until 2018, with financing
needs peaking at 19 percent of GDP in 2017.



Contingent fiscal shock. This scenario assumes that 50 percent of state guarantees to the
financial sector are called upon in 2015. While the debt and financing needs impact is large, the
nature of state guarantees is such that they are unlikely to be exercised to such a degree within

the same year. Moreover, the Belgian state could cover some of these costs by selling assets
(public enterprises and shares in BNP) which have an estimated worth of 10 percent of GDP.

Belgium: Financial System Stability Assessment, including Reports
on the Observance of Standards and Codes on the following topics:
Banking Supervision and Regulation, and Insurance Supervision
and Regulation

IMF Country Report
No. 13/124

Summary: During the 2013 FSAP Update, staff assessed progress with the implementation of the
2006 FSAP recommendations. The report outlines that the authorities have made progress in
addressing the recommendations of the 2006 FSAP but many recommendations in the area of
conglomerate supervision and governance remain relevant. The new institutional model is a work in
progress and better communication and coordination between supervisory institutions is needed.
Improvements are evident in the intensity of banking supervision and the adoption of analytical
tools to support system-wide monitoring, including the introduction of an intensive process for
determining Pillar II capital requirements, liquidity stress testing for the banking sector, and
introduction of macrofinancial risk dashboard to monitor systemic and emerging risk. Funding and
risk management standards are being improved. Supervisory tools for monitoring group-wide risks
need to be upgraded. The crisis management framework, while updated for handling systemic firms,
is in need of a further upgrade owing in part to EU-wide developments.
Insurance supervision has been significantly strengthened although further work is needed,
particularly, in strengthening the solvency framework. Both bank and insurance supervisory
frameworks integrate vertical analyses of individual insurers with horizontal review of the sector. The
adoption of the new institutional architecture has allowed the FSMA to focus solely on market and
business conduct and the adoption of EU directives in the interim has addressed many of the
recommendations for the securities sector. The FSMA’s plan to adopt a risk-based approach to
conduct supervision must be adequately resourced. Pension regulation and supervision has been

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

strengthened. While pension funds remain the remit of the FSMA, there is currently a debate as to
whether this should be the responsibility of the NBB.
Belgium: Report on Observance of Standards and Codes—Fiscal
Transparency Module

IMF Country Report
No. 08/116

Summary: The report found that in many areas Belgium meets, and in some cases exceeds, the
requirements of the fiscal transparency code. The basic government finance processes are
supported by a sound institutional and legal framework. Roles and responsibilities in the budget
process are clear, with a well-defined separation of powers between the executive and legislature.
Fiscal information is provided through regular publications and extensive use of the internet. Budget
formulation is appropriately supported by medium-term macroeconomic forecasts and clearly
formulated medium-term fiscal policy goals, and fiscal policy is presented clearly, and in a mediumterm context. Finally, audit processes are extensive and help improve budget management
decisions, practices and standards, with government financial decisions evaluated ex ante and ex
post by various institutions.
There is room to improve the quality and openness of budget processes: (i) there is limited insight
about the objectives and targets of government expenditure; (ii) the medium-term budget estimates
need to make budgetary decision-making more oriented to the medium-term; (iii) the presentation
of new policy measures and their medium-term costs could be clarified; (iv) and budget
implementation by departments and agencies could be streamlined. Information available to the
public on the following topics could be increased: (i) fiscal risk and tax expenditures in budget
documents; (ii) in-year budgetary data on local government and agencies; (iii) the content of the
final government accounts; and (iv) the governance of state-owned equity holdings.
Institutional arrangements for fiscal policy coordination could be strengthened by (i) reinforcing and
expanding the role of the High Council of Finance, including by providing additional institutional
safeguards as to its continuity and independence, and having the Council cover all important issues
bearing on fiscal policy; and (ii) converting the budget agreements between the federal government,
regions, and communities into published agreements which specify the targeted balance for each
partner and identify the measures needed to achieve this target.
Finally, internal audit processes could be better coordinated and simplified by reducing the number
of internal control and audit layers—which makes the Court of Audit’s recent Single Audit initiative
to minimize overlap, coordinate work programs, and to share common data and analysis,
particularly timely.

Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT):
In line with the relevant IMF Board decisions, a full reassessment of Belgium’s AML/CFT framework is
required. Belgium was last assessed in 2005 by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a new
assessment by the FATF is tentatively scheduled for June 2014. The 2005 assessment found that,
overall, Belgium’s AML/CFT framework largely complied with the standard. This was, in particular,
the case with respect to the criminalization of money-laundering and terrorist financing.
Shortcomings were nevertheless identified, notably with respect to the supervision of nonbank
financial institutions, transparency of beneficial ownership and control of legal entities, regulation of
designated nonfinancial businesses and professions, and to the freezing of terrorist assets. Since
2005, it appears that the authorities have taken steps to address these shortcomings. As reported by
the Belgian authorities to the FATF, these steps include measures to reinforce the framework for the
freezing of terrorist assets (2006), and the adoption of a new AML/CFT law (2010).

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Belgium’s economic and financial statistics are adequate for surveillance purposes. The
National Bank of Belgium (NBB) regularly publishes a full range of economic and financial data and
provides calendar dates of main statistical releases. On-line access to these comprehensive
databases is facilitated by the NBB’s data search engine, Belgostat. Belgium is a SDDS subscriber.
Statistics for International Financial Statistics on banking institutions and monetary aggregates are
prepared on a monthly basis and are timely.
Belgium adopted the European System of Integrated Economic Accounts 1995 (ESA95)
in 1999. Revisions of national accounts started in November 2005 to comply with EUROSTAT
requirements and prepare for the adoption of chain-linked national accounts statistics. Unlike in
other countries, the NBB is responsible for compiling national accounts statistics. Quarterly accounts
are published within a lag of three months. Both annual and quarterly accounts data are of good
quality, with shortcomings mainly related to export and import deflators, which are based on unit
values, rather than prices collected directly from exporters and importers.
Belgium compiles and publishes a complete set of general government accounts on an accrual
basis (ESA95). The NBB publishes annual and quarterly data on general government revenue,
expenditure, and net lending/ borrowing; transactions in financial assets and liabilities and a
financial balance sheet data; and details on the consolidated gross debt.
The overall quality and availability of financial indicators are good. The authorities are
providing quarterly updates of financial sector indicators (FSIs) in a timely manner.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with Belgium
On March 5, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with Belgium.
The strong financial position of the non-financial private sector and economic integration with
Germany dampened the impact of the crisis, but recovery from the stagnation of 2012–13 has
been slow, as in much of Europe. As private consumption and investment should respond
positively to improved external conditions, real GDP is expected to grow by just over 1 percent
and the negative impulse from fiscal consolidation is expected to be limited in 2014. However,
projected economic growth would still be insufficient to reduce the unemployment rate. The
reduction of value-added tax on energy should keep headline inflation at around 1 percent, below
core inflation.
Notwithstanding its resilience, the economy has lost competitiveness since 2005, due to lower
productivity and higher wage growth than in peer countries. In response, the government has
taken measures to close the wage gap relative to the three main trade partners (Germany, France,
and the Netherlands). In order to make the economy more productive and adaptable, the
government has also taken steps to reform unemployment, pension, and pre-pensions benefits.
But there is scope for further and deeper reforms of labor and product markets.
Fiscal consolidation continues at a steady pace. In 2012–13, the structural fiscal deficit was
reduced by 1.1 percent of GDP and the headline deficit is expected to come down to 2.7 percent
of GDP in 2013. The government’s sale of its 25 percent share in BNPP Fortis helped keep the
debt ratio just below the 100 percent in 2013. Additional structural adjustment of 3.3 percent of
GDP is needed to meet the government’s medium-term fiscal objective. A burden sharing

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2
agreement clarifies the fiscal adjustment responsibilities of the federal and regional governments
toward that objective.
Banks have largely completed the process of balance sheet repair but face the challenge of low
profitability and adaptation to regulatory changes. Reductions in cross-border exposures and
sales of foreign subsidiaries have reduced the balance sheet of banks from 410 percent of GDP
in 2008 to 268 percent in mid–2013. Improved liquidity and solvency positions have
strengthened banks’ capacity to absorb shocks, but profitability has been weak due to low
interest margins and high operating costs. The supervisory and regulatory frameworks are being
strengthened, notably with a new draft banking law which restrains trading activities and
improves the recovery and resolution framework, including by increasing buffers for depositor
protection.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended the efforts undertaken by the authorities to restore financial
stability, consolidate public finances, increase labor market participation, and strengthen cost
competitiveness. Notwithstanding these efforts, Directors noted that significant challenges
remain, and called for a comprehensive strategy to overcome remaining impediments to
sustainable growth, risks to debt sustainability, persistently high unemployment rates, and the
deterioration in external competitiveness. They recommended measures to put the public
finances on a sustainable footing, including by making social spending more efficient, inclusive
of pensions; reducing labor and product market rigidities; and safeguarding financial stability.
Directors suggested that a steady pace of structural fiscal adjustment would help to create fiscal
space to address the cost of an ageing population and undertake productivity enhancing
investment, while placing the debt ratio on a sustainable path. They recommended rebalancing
consolidation toward expenditure measures, with emphasis on reducing current spending and
safeguarding critical investment spending, and away from taxation of labor income toward
indirect and environmental taxes. Directors welcomed the adoption of new fiscal rules, consistent
with the European Union fiscal compact, which entail appropriate burden sharing between
national and sub-national governments.
Directors commended the recent improvement in financial sector stability and resilience through
the strengthening in the supervisory and regulatory framework of the banking system, in line
with Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) recommendations. They welcomed the
tightening of capital requirements on mortgage lending, which will help dampen upward

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

pressure on real estate prices, and the considerable efforts undertaken to repair and strengthen
bank balance sheets. In light of the current low-profit environment, Directors called for regular
monitoring of banks’ business models and asset portfolios, with a view to ensuring that capital
positions are strengthened in line with Basel III requirements. They looked forward to prompt
parliamentary approval of the draft banking law, designed to curtail risky trading activity and
improve the recovery and resolution framework.
Directors underscored the critical role of structural reforms for restoring external
competitiveness and increasing potential growth. They advised that wage setting should better
reflect productivity developments and domestic and regional labor market conditions.
Directors encouraged continued reforms to promote labor mobility and adaptability, raise
employment rates, eliminate barriers to competition, further reduce utility costs, and lighten the
heavy burden of regulation.
