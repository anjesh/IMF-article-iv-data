EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Owing to strong institutions and sound economic policies, Chile has experienced two
decades of economic stability and increasing living standards. The rules-based policy
framework has helped preserve competitiveness during the recent copper boom. With trend
growth at around 5 percent, further progress has been made in reducing poverty, although
income inequality remains relatively high.
Following a strong performance in the first quarter, growth is expected to reach
5¾ percent in 2007, with the output gap likely to close in 2008. Fiscal policy remains
anchored by the structural surplus rule; as the government has paid down debt and moved
into a net creditor position, the structural surplus target has been lowered from 1 to ½ percent
of GDP as of 2008. Given the strong growth outlook, monetary policy will likely tighten
gradually as excess capacity is absorbed. The exchange rate is assessed to be broadly in line
with fundamentals.
This streamlined consultation has focused on two key areas, reaffirming a broad
consensus with the authorities:
•

The macroeconomic policy framework. The authorities remain committed to the
well-tested policy framework consisting of a freely floating exchange rate, an
inflation targeting framework, and responsible fiscal policy as embedded in the
structural surplus rule. Successful implementation of this framework has created
increasing room for addressing social priorities, which the authorities intend to pursue
in an incentive-compatible manner, accompanied by further increases in transparency.

•

Bridging the income gap with advanced economies. Policies to raise long-term
growth prospects focus on education, job-specific human capital, and innovation.
Financial sector reforms are aimed at increasing depth and competition in Chile’s
financial sector, and integrating Chile further into the global financial system.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Over the past fifteen years, Chile’s consistent economic reforms and prudent
macroeconomic policies have delivered strong growth and low inflation. Per capita income
tripled in U.S. dollar terms since 1990 and the poverty rate was cut by two-thirds, to about
14 percent. Growth was fastest during the mid-1990s, but has slowed somewhat in recent
years amid stagnant employment, less FDI inflows, and declining labor productivity growth.
Moreover, extreme poverty persists—although mitigated by well-targeted social programs—
and income inequality remains relatively high.
2.
Key elements of Chile’s economic policies have been institutionalized, increasing
transparency and reducing volatility. With its open economy and liberal trade regime, the
macroeconomic policy framework—a floating exchange rate, inflation targeting and a
structural fiscal surplus rule—has been geared toward reducing economic volatility from
shocks. These policies have helped maintain the economy’s competitiveness despite the high
price volatility of copper, Chile’s main export product, and provide increasing room to
address social priorities.
3.
Domestic consensus on the policy framework remains solid. President Bachelet took
office in March 2006 with a strong mandate to strengthen social policies within a sound
macroeconomic framework. The government enjoys a majority in both houses of Congress,
and although it has grappled recently with a complex overhaul of Santiago’s public transit
system, it is actively pushing forward an ambitious reform agenda. In May, the President
announced a reduction in the structural surplus target from 1 to ½ percent of GDP in 2008,
with additional resources to be devoted primarily to education.
4.
The discussions have reaffirmed a broad consensus on economic policies and
reform priorities between the authorities and the Fund (last year’s Board discussion is
summarized in PIN No. 06/97).
II. OUTLOOK AND RISKS
5.
Following a strong rebound in the first quarter of 2007, growth is projected at
about 5¾ percent this year. The completion of some large capital projects has boosted
productive capacity, and consumer demand remains strong, underpinned by favorable labor
market conditions and buoyant consumer credit growth.1 Growth is also underpinned by a
supportive fiscal and monetary policy stance, and a broad-based rise in exports.2 With
potential growth estimated at 5 percent, Fund and central bank staff expect the output gap to

1

Staff analysis suggests that credit growth in Chile is less affected by the cycle than by structural developments,
such as rising department store lending to low and middle-income households.

Staff estimates of the fiscal impulse (Table 2) are preliminary and work in progress.

close in 2008 (from around 1 percent at end-2006) and inflation to return to the 3 percent
target.
6.
Risks to the outlook appear broadly balanced. The baseline forecast implies some
softening in the pace of expansion toward the end of the year, but there is a possibility that
the already strong domestic momentum could receive a further boost from improving labor
market conditions. On the other hand, drought conditions and interruptions in gas deliveries
from Argentina pose risks to electricity production; rises in oil and food prices would reduce
disposable income; and tightening global liquidity might dampen domestic credit expansion.
7.
Supply shocks and diminishing excess capacity could present upside risks to
inflation. Strong import growth has helped contain price increases, and overall labor cost
growth has been moderate despite a strong pickup in hourly wages. Stronger demand
conditions could imply a more rapid closing of the output gap, although officials at the Banco
Central de Chile (BCC) were optimistic that a procyclical rise in labor participation would
limit pressure on unit labor costs.
8.
Banks are profitable and highly capitalized, and the financial system appears well
prepared to weather an external shock. Reflecting sound economic fundamentals and the
government’s strong balance sheet, staff analysis suggests that a drop in global risk appetite
to the lows of 1998 could push up Chile’s EMBI spread only by a modest 70 basis points.
While this would also increase private sector financing costs, Chilean banks and corporates

7
are in a better position to accommodate external shocks than in the past. Based on model
simulations, risks in the banking sector would remain well below 1998.3
9.
With Chile accounting for a third of global copper production, spillover effects to
the rest of the world center around the mining outlook. Labor disputes and technical
problems slowed production in 2006, but completion of several labor contracts and
investment projects should propel output toward its projected medium-term growth rate of
3 percent per year. Water and environmental constraints could eventually limit the pace of
expansion, but Chile’s copper deposits are deemed large enough to sustain production for
longer than in most other countries with non-renewable resources.
III. MACROECONOMIC POLICY FRAMEWORK
Fiscal policy
10.
Fiscal policy remains well anchored by the structural surplus rule. The authorities
emphasized that Chile’s long-standing prudent fiscal policy had created the space for the
moderate reduction in the structural surplus target. They firmly expected the 2008 budget to
be consistent with overall macroeconomic stability, with the amount of the expenditure
increase determined—under the rules-based framework—mainly by the long-term reference
price for copper and projected revenues at potential GDP growth.4 The authorities had noted
some recent weakness in VAT collections which, if sustained, would affect projected
revenue—and thus spending—for next year.
11.
Looking ahead, the authorities intend to maintain a positive surplus target in part
to fund future pension costs. The government is committed to put between 0.2 and
½ percent of GDP per year into a public pension fund, depending on the size of the actual
fiscal surplus, to help finance the proposed pension reform (see below). The ongoing
program of recapitalizing the BCC balance sheet will continue as planned (by ½ percent of
GDP in each of the next three years).
12.
Efforts are underway to raise further the effectiveness of government spending.
While pointing to the exemplary success of Chile’s fiscal expenditure framework, officials
noted the importance of spending additional resources in a cost-effective way. To that end,
the government announced steps to improve public financial management, including through
new agencies supervising public investment and education, impose tighter coordination over
regional spending, and the introduction of a new fiscal transparency law. The officials

welcomed the staff’s proposal to shift to a medium-term expenditure framework to tie annual
budget decisions more closely to the government’s strategic objectives.
Monetary and exchange rate policy
13.
Monetary policy will likely tighten gradually as excess capacity is absorbed. As the
economy slowed in 2006, the BCC first paused the tightening cycle underway since 2004,
and then lowered interest rates by 25 basis points in early 2007. With recent data pointing to
a strong and broad-based recovery, policy may have to resume a gradual tightening course in
the months ahead. Long-term interest rates have ticked upwards in recent weeks, and many
analysts expect a resumption of rate increases. As in the past, the BCC will take into account
all available information in gauging the inflation outlook and any needed policy response,
including the impact of the announced reduction in the fiscal surplus target.
14.
Monetary policy has been successful in anchoring inflation expectations firmly
around the 3 percent policy target, despite major shifts in the terms of trade. To increase
transparency, the BCC in January adjusted its inflation target to “around 3 percent, with a
tolerance range of ± one percentage point” to focus attention on the previous mid-point of the
target range.5 The authorities welcomed a staff suggestion to conduct periodic pre-determined
reviews of the inflation targeting framework.
15.
The value of the peso is broadly in line with fundamentals. Despite a sizeable
nominal appreciation against the U.S. dollar, the real effective exchange rate has appreciated
only moderately since the onset of the copper boom in 2004. Staff’s empirical work
(including CGER analysis and a background study of the performance of non-copper
exports) shows that competitiveness remains adequate.

5

The previous target consisted of a range of 2–4 percent over a time horizon of meeting the target of
12-24 months. The new time horizon is set to “around 2 years.”

9
16.
The authorities confirmed their commitment to maintaining a floating exchange
rate. Given the strong external position and upward pressure on the peso, the government is
advancing part of the planned increase in foreign investment limits for pension funds.6 The
authorities reiterated their policy of not intervening in the foreign exchange market except if
they judged that a market overreaction could have potentially adverse consequences for the
economy.
17.
In light of the strong buildup in foreign assets, the authorities are developing a
long-term strategy for the allocation of those funds. The assets accumulated in the two
funds created under the 2006 Fiscal Responsibility Law have been managed by the BCC
since March 2007. A recent assessment of the management of foreign exchange reserves
found the BCC to be in observance of the IMF Guidelines for Foreign Exchange Reserve
Management and having adequate institutional capacity in this area.
IV. BRIDGING THE INCOME GAP WITH ADVANCED ECONOMIES
18.
Building on well-developed institutions and strong governance, Chile has set its
sights on raising long-term growth to close the income gap with industrialized countries
(table below). To address key factors limiting Chile’s growth potential and further reduce
vulnerabilities to external shocks, the government is pursuing an ambitious structural reform
agenda, including in education, pensions, innovation, and the financial sector. Integrating
Chile’s financial sector system more closely with global capital markets will play an
important role in strengthening competitive forces and catalyzing reforms in other sectors.
Human capital and the labor market
19.
Education will be the prime beneficiary of the reduced fiscal target. Most of the
freed-up funds will be used to raise the value of student vouchers, and an education reform
bill submitted to Congress aims at raising quality and improving access especially for lowincome households. The government has also launched initiatives to improve the climate for
entrepreneurship and innovation, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises
(SMEs).
20.
A major pension reform is to raise benefits, improve coverage, increase returns to
saving, and encourage participation in the formal labor market. The proposed reform
includes a universal public pension pillar and aims at boosting participation of low-income
groups and the self-employed (Box 1). Although public benefits will be substantially
increased, the authorities were confident that the additional cost of the new system, netted

6

Under the pension reform plan, the investment limit is to be raised gradually from 30 to 80 percent of pension
fund assets. In May, the government announced legislation to raise the limit to 45 percent.

against the cost of maintaining the current system, will be kept to a maximum of one percent

21.
Although employment growth has picked up, greater labor market flexibility would
facilitate factor reallocation in response to external shocks and competitive pressures. The
authorities are currently building consensus for strengthening the social protection of workers
and improving the unemployment insurance system. Staff noted that separation costs
appeared high, and that instruments facilitating part-time employment were not being widely
used.
22.
The results of a recent ROSC Update suggest that Chile’s macroeconomic statistics
are generally timely and of good quality. The mission encouraged the authorities to improve
the coverage of surveys on labor costs, capacity utilization, and prices, as well as other
statistical data in line with practices in industrialized economies (see table).

7

Preliminary cost estimates by the staff are broadly in line with the authorities’ calculations.

11
Statistical Issues and Macroeconomic Analysis
Chile subscribes to the Fund's Special Data Dissemination Standard. The results of a recent data ROSC Update suggest that
the macroeconomic statistics are generally sound, and gain high marks for assurances of integrity, serviceability, and
accessibility. However, compared to economic statistics of many industrial countries, some gaps remain.
Labor
market

Genuine unit labor cost data are not available, in part because of limited information on hours worked. Time
series on wages by sector were discontinued in 2005. However, monthly indices of average compensation as
well as of hourly labor cost are published. The two major unemployment surveys (by the University of Chile and
the National Statistics Institute) could be improved to provide a consistent labor market picture.

National
accounts

Despite the overall high quality of the national accounts, data on inventories and inventory prices tend to be
erratic and hard to interpret, given that they are mainly estimated as residuals in the balancing of the supply and
use table. Shifting the national accounts to chain price indexing would reduce base-year distortions and improve
the statistical treatment of copper price fluctuations.

Producer
data and
price
statistics

Capacity utilization data are not yet available on a time series basis. The CPI has limited geographic coverage,
and its basket and weight structure remain outdated pending planned improvements. For the PPI, adjustments
for quality differences are not made (in particular, the copper price collection procedure increases quality
induced volatility), and missing prices are carried forward from the last observed price in most of the categories.

Fiscal
data

Adoption of the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001) is a major improvement. However,
the reconciliation of the fiscal balance with changes in government net debt could be improved, and timely highfrequency data on tax revenue by type of tax would help the analysis of revenue and general economic trends.
Some gaps remain in the coverage of military debt, but efforts are underway to improve the legal framework for
compiling such data.

Capital
account
data

Chile provides monthly information on portfolio investment flows, as well as assets and liabilities, in line with
international statistical standards. A more detailed breakdown of portfolio flows, including on a gross basis as
well as geographical basis, would assist economic analysis.

Financial sector
23.
A second round of capital market reforms was passed into law in late May, and
market participants generally welcomed the progress achieved in recent years. Planned
additional measures for 2007 include steps to internationalize the peso, further develop local
markets, strengthen corporate governance and facilitate foreign investment. The mission
agreed that providing smaller borrowers, including SMEs, with improved capital market
access could unlock productive capacity and benefit innovation, and that care was needed to
not impose effective ceilings on SMEs’ size.
24.
The financial component of the pension reform could assist market development.
Broadening portfolio options for Pension Fund Administrators (AFPs) and raising their
foreign investment limits could reduce excess demand for high-quality domestic assets,
expose domestic borrowers to stronger competition, and help in the development of local
markets. The authorities are planning a gradual approach to liberalization, with the pace
depending on financial stability considerations and the capacity of AFPs to manage assets in
a more complex financial environment.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
25.
Reflecting its strong institutional framework and sound macroeconomic policies,
Chile has experienced two decades of economic stability and increasing living standards.
Although trend growth remains below the level of the 1990s, Chile has rightly set its sights
on eliminating poverty and closing the income gap with industrialized economies. Staff

12
supports the government’s strategy of maintaining the macroeconomic framework while
addressing social issues and implementing structural reforms to boost long-term growth.
26.
Amid growing signs of a rebound, the economy is projected to expand by around
5¾ percent in 2007. Upside risks for domestic demand are balanced by concerns over energy
supply and modest downside risks from the global outlook. Inflation is expected to rise
toward the BCC’s 3-percent target, and the peso is assessed to be broadly in line with
fundamentals.
27.
With inflation expectations firmly anchored, monetary policy appropriately
supported the economy’s recovery through the slowdown in 2006. Given strong output
growth, monetary stimulus will likely be withdrawn in the coming months. The BCC’s
balance sheet has been strengthened, and the staff welcomes the government’s commitment
to continue to recapitalize the bank.
28.
Fiscal policy remains well anchored by the structural surplus rule. A modest
reduction in the surplus target is justified by the improvement in the government’s net debt
position. The staff welcomes the authorities’ intention—supported by the rules-based
system—to keep public expenditure increases consistent with macroeconomic stability. In
order to cover future pension liabilities, the authorities are committed to maintaining a
positive surplus target for the foreseeable future.
29.
Ensuring high-quality public spending remains critical. Costs and benefits of new
expenditure projects will need to be carefully weighed, and planned steps to improve the
efficiency of government spending and increase transparency are well placed. Establishing a
medium-term expenditure framework would allow annual budget decisions to be tied more
closely to the government’s strategic objectives.
30.
The proposed pension reform addresses the main shortcomings of the current
system, while maintaining many of its pioneering basic features. A key goal of the reform
is to increase pension coverage and equity in the system. The authorities are confident that
the overall cost of the reform can be kept within the projected amount of one percent of GDP
per year, and that incentives to save will be unimpaired. The mission welcomes steps to
gradually increase foreign investment limits for pension funds, which will allow them to
optimize their portfolio allocation and is timely in view of the strong external position.
31.
The government has launched welcome initiatives to boost human capital and
innovation, and integrate Chile more closely into global capital markets. Improving
education and reducing skills gaps will be key to raising long-term growth prospects.
Targeted initiatives can be useful to help smaller enterprises if designed in a way that does
not impose a ceiling on their future size. Financial sector reforms will play an important role
in strengthening competitive forces and catalyzing reforms in other sectors.

13
32.
There is room to make labor markets more flexible, and to strengthen incentives to
participate in the labor market.
33.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the regular
12-month cycle.

14
Box 1. Reforming the Pension System
The government’s proposals for a comprehensive reform of Chile’s 26-year old pension
system focus on addressing several shortcomings. The system’s coverage ratio is relatively
low, in part because many workers have failed to accumulate the necessary 20 years’ worth of
contributions. Many women, in particular, are left without incomes in old age; and investment
options have been constrained. The reform is a top priority for President Bachelet’s
government, and has been developed by a high-level commission of experts in a broad
consultative process.
Figure 1. Pensions Under Proposed System
350
Pension Including Government Support
(thousands of pesos a month)

The cornerstone of the reform is the
Basic Solidarity Pension (BSP),
which introduces a universal pillar
into Chile’s privatized system. The
reform creates a minimum pension
for Chileans over 65 (equal to about
one fifth of the average wage) and
provides means-tested subsidies to
poor the poor. The proposal also
subsidizes initial contributions by
women and the young, while
gradually enforcing participation
among the self-employed.

The authorities are confident that overall incentives to work and save would not worsen
under the new system, although some tradeoffs are typically unavoidable. In the new system,
the marginal return on a dollar’s worth of additional pension saving would be positive for all
workers:
•

Workers currently receiving the (flat) minimum pension guarantee do not obtain a
higher pension for an additional dollar worth of pension savings. Under the new
system, their marginal return would increase to 62.5 cents per dollar saved.

•

Workers currently receiving more than the minimum pension guarantee would also
face a marginal return of 62.5 cents (unless their pension income exceeds CLP
200,000 per month; see chart). In their case, however, the marginal return is lower
than the 100 cents return they receive under the current system.

The reform also has a strong financial component, aimed at increasing competition among
pension funds and raising real returns to pensioners. In addition to liberalizing investments
rules for Pension Fund Administrators (AFPs), the reform boosts competition among AFPs by
auctioning the right to serve new entrants and allowing domestic banks to enter the market.
The government estimates the cost of the reform at around 1 percent of GDP per year, partly
funded from returns on a pension fund accumulated with the help of structural government
surpluses. Congressional debate of the reform is expected to last into 2008.

1/ Average implied losses and distance to default measures are derived from a contingent claims model for the Chilean banking
system. Distance to default refers to the number of standard deviations by which implied bank assets exceed default levels. Average
implied losses are the probability-weighted losses of the banking sector averaged over the next year.

Annex I. Chile: Analytical Work and Technical Assistance
1. Ongoing Background Work
Chile's Structural Fiscal Balance Rule: A Model Based Evaluation
The paper analyzes Chile's structural fiscal rule using the IMF's Global Integrated Monetary and Fiscal Model
(GIMF) to determine which parameters would minimize inflation and output volatility in a stochastic environment. It
does so along two dimensions, first by comparing the use of different fiscal instruments (taxes, transfers, spending),
and second by allowing for a more or less countercyclical response to excess tax or copper revenue.
Application of Contingent Claims Analysis to Chile
A background paper for the consultation produces risk indicators based on equity and debt data for seven major
Chilean banks. It extends the CCA model by tying the returns on banking-sector assets to macroeconomic
variables. The results suggest that banks are quite heterogeneous in their responsiveness to foreign and exchangerate shocks and sensitivity to interest-rate changes. The paper also presents scenarios to see how bank
capitalization is affected by various macroeconomic shocks.
Credit Cyclicality: A Cross-Country Comparison
This paper studies the determinants of credit cyclicality and compares Chile with 19 other emerging markets and
advanced countries. Using both country-specific and panel VARs, the study focuses on the effects of financial
frictions and financial development on the degree of pro-cyclicality of credit.
Trade Performance, Trade Liberalization and Competitiveness
This study analyses recent developments of non-copper exports and imports, in particular the impact of exchange
rate movement and of trade liberalization. The analysis is conducted by means of a vector error correction model
(VECM) using quarterly data for 1990-2006. Trade elasticities for Chile are also compared to those of other Latin
American countries.
2. Recent Technical Assistance
Risk Management and Contingent Claims Analysis
The BCC and Fund staff collaborate closely in the area of contingent claims analysis and identification of domestic
and external vulnerabilities. This has included several missions as well as a paper in the BCC's Financial Stability
Report co-written with Fund staff.
Assessing the Institutional Aspects of Reserves Management
The BCC was appointed as the government's fiscal agent in the management of the Economic and Social
Stabilization Fund and of the Pensions Reserve Fund in March 2007. An MCM mission has been assessing the
BCC's compliance with Fund management reserves management guidelines in April 2007, the results of which are
reported in this report.

July 13, 2007
1.
This supplement reports on economic and policy developments since the staff report
was issued on June 25. The thrust of the staff appraisal remains unchanged.
2.
Economic developments remain consistent with output growth of around
5¾ percent in 2007. On an annualized basis, the monthly GDP indicator has been growing at
above 6 percent so far this year, and strong retail sales and employment data confirm the
broad-based nature of the recovery. WEO projections for copper prices have been raised
since the staff report was issued, raising the projected current account and fiscal surpluses
(see table).
3.
Inflation has surprised on the upside in May and June, with both headline and core
inflation now slightly above the 3 percent target. Amid upward pressure from food and
energy prices, staff projects inflation to remain around this level for the rest of the year.
Medium-term inflation expectations continue to be firmly anchored at the 3 percent level.
4.
The Banco Central de Chile (BCC) lifted its policy rate by 25 basis points to
5¼ percent on July 12. Citing global supply shocks and reduced slack in the economy, the
BCC also anticipated that it would likely be necessary to further reduce monetary stimulus in
the coming months.
5.
The 2007 central government surplus is now projected at over 7 percent of GDP,
compared with 6 percent of GDP in the staff report. The update reflects higher copper
prices and a projected rebound in VAT receipts receipts based on improved collections in
recent months. Invested government assets now exceed 10 percent of GDP, more than twice
central government debt.
6.
In line with its commitment to recapitalize the central bank gradually, the
government transferred $736 million (½ percent of GDP) to the BCC in late June. The first
such annual payment was made in December 2006.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with Chile
On July 16, 2007 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Chile.1
Background
The Chilean economy is enjoying a broad-based upswing, fueled by a strong global
environment and buoyant domestic demand. Underpinned by supportive fiscal and monetary
policies, GDP growth is expected to reach 5¾ percent in 2007, above the estimated potential
growth rate of around 5 percent. Buoyant credit growth and strengthening labor market
conditions continue to boost consumer spending, solid corporate profits and favorable financial
conditions have contributed to higher investment, and exports are rising with strong external
demand. Despite a sizeable nominal appreciation against the U.S. dollar, the real effective
exchange rate has only moderately appreciated since the onset of the copper boom in 2004.
Inflation has recently increased but remains close to the 3 percent inflation target. The increase
is attributable to higher global food and energy prices and reduced slack in the economy, while
labor cost increases have been contained. Citing these factors, the central bank raised its policy
rate by 25 basis points to 5¼ percent on July 12, noting also that it would likely be necessary to
further reduce monetary stimulus in the coming months.
Fiscal developments have continued to benefit from revenues associated with strong copper
prices, with expenditure increases in line with permanent revenues under the structural fiscal
surplus rule. The nominal fiscal surplus is expected to be at over 7 percent of GDP in 2007,
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
based on strong corporate tax revenues and a projected rebound in VAT receipts. Invested
government financial assets now exceed 10 percent of GDP, and the central government has
become a net creditor. Reflecting the improvement in its financial position, the government
announced a reduction of the structural fiscal surplus target from 1 percent to ½ percent of GDP
beginning in 2008.
The authorities have advanced a broad structural reform agenda. A major pension reform,
designed to achieve broader coverage, liberalize investment rules for pension funds, and
increase competition in the financial sector has been submitted to Congress. A second round of
capital market reforms was passed into law in May, aimed at further developing domestic
markets and integrating the financial sector more closely into global capital markets. The
government has also launched initiatives to boost education, strengthen job-specific human
capital, and promote innovation.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended Chile’s strong institutions and sound macroeconomic policies,
which, supported by ongoing structural reforms, have increased the resilience of the economy
to external shocks, kept inflation and the public debt low, sustained high economic growth, and
led to rising living standards over the past two decades. Directors supported the government’s
strategy of maintaining the current rules-based macroeconomic framework while addressing
social issues and implementing structural reforms to boost long-term growth. A key challenge
will be to further reduce income inequality and eliminate the remaining pockets of extreme
poverty.
Directors commended the central bank for its success in maintaining price stability and
anchoring inflation expectations at the target level. After supporting the economy through the
slowdown in 2006, monetary policy has appropriately shifted toward withdrawing stimulus in
view of the rebound in activity and the potential risks from higher global food and energy prices.
Directors endorsed the floating exchange rate policy, and agreed that the value of the currency
is broadly in line with economic fundamentals.
Directors welcomed the government’s continued commitment to the structural fiscal surplus
rule, which has helped maintain competitiveness under large positive terms of trade shocks.
They viewed the modest reduction in the surplus target beginning in 2008 as appropriate in view
of the sharp improvement in the government’s financial position in recent years, noting that it
provides room for additional social spending. Directors also welcomed the government’s
commitment to continue to build up a pension reserve fund and recapitalize the central bank.
Directors noted the recent rebound in value added tax collections, and recommended that
revenue performance continue to be monitored closely.
Noting the success of Chile’s performance-based budgeting system, Directors considered the
authorities’ plans to further strengthen the quality of government spending and increase
transparency as well placed. They encouraged the authorities to move toward adopting a
medium-term expenditure framework to align annual budget decisions closely with the
government’s strategic objectives.

3
Directors supported the proposed pension reform, which is designed to address the main
shortcomings of the current system while maintaining many of its pioneering basic features.
They viewed the proposed liberalization of investment rules for pension funds as timely, in view
of Chile’s strong external position and the need to deepen domestic financial markets. Directors
considered it important that, in implementing the reform, its overall cost be kept within the
projected amount of one percent of GDP, and that incentives to save remain unimpaired.
Directors commended the authorities’ structural reform agenda, aimed at raising long-term
growth and closing the income gap with industrialized countries through improved education,
innovation, and financial development. They noted the strength and resilience of the banking
system, and welcomed recent measures to strengthen capital markets. Directors encouraged
the authorities to continue with reforms aimed at fostering competition, enhancing labor market
flexibility, and integrating the financial system further into global capital markets.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Javier Silva-Ruete, Executive Director for Chile
and Alvaro Rojas, Advisor to Executive Director
July 16, 2007
1.
This year, Chile’s Article IV Consultation was conducted under the streamlining
procedures, as established under the Medium-Term Strategy, given the broad consensus on
economic policies and the absence of systemic issues. Our authorities would like to thank the
IMF staff for a comprehensive and useful report, which clearly reflects the permanent
collaborative dialogue that has characterized the relationship between Chile and the Fund,
and which in no way was affected by the streamlined consultation process. We look forward
to conveying the results of this Board discussion to our authorities.
Outlook and Risks
2.
After growing 4 percent in 2006, due to one-off adverse events in natural resource
sectors, higher energy prices and restrictions on the supply of natural gas from Argentina,
some switching effects from domestic to external production in specific sectors, and a
marked cycle in fixed capital investment, output growth has resumed during the first half of
2007 at a faster pace than previously envisaged. A favorable external environment, recovery
in investment, firm expansion in private consumption supported by favorable financial
conditions as well as positive labor market conditions and supportive macroeconomic
policies have facilitated stronger growth. In addition, during 2007 the operation of new plants
in the natural resources sector (pulp and mining) will further expand Chile’s productive
capacity. The Central Bank of Chile’s (CBCh) central scenario projects GDP growth for
2007 between 5 and 6 percent, with a balance of risks with an upward bias, figures that are
above the trend growth of the economy.
3.
Given the positive outlook for growth in 2007, the output gap is expected to close
gradually over the year, based on expansion in domestic demand and exports. Private
consumption has remained a key driver of domestic demand in the current cycle. This strong
consumption is expected to continue going forward, in line with increasing household
income and credit expansion. Investment has exhibited a rebound from the low levels of the
second half of 2006, as evidenced by an acceleration of imported capital goods, an increasing
public investment, upward revisions of private investment intentions for 2008 and 2009, and
also an improvement in business confidence indicators, strong firm cash flows and favorable
financial conditions. In terms of external demand, the favorable outlook for the global
economy should be the key driver of a broad based increase in exports, particularly from the
non-copper sector which has expanded its export volume above 10 percent during the first
semester of this year. It is noteworthy that, despite strong positive terms of trade shock
extending over the last few years, the real effective exchange rate has remained
approximately equal to its 15-year average.

Considering the CBCh growth scenario, risks are tilted to the upside, meaning that
growth in the upper part of the range, and even above 6 percent cannot be ruled out. This is
consistent with the broadly balanced-risk scenario described in the staff report, given the
central scenario considered therein. As highlighted in the staff report, the downside risks are
mainly external, such as an unanticipated change in global liquidity conditions, further
increases in the price of oil and other food products, and the further limitations in the
provision of natural gas from Argentina as well as other restrictions in the energy sector. The
upside risks include an expansion of consumption above the dynamic pace already shown in
recent months due to the more favorable developments in the labor markets, which could also
pose an additional risk in terms of tighter excess capacity going forward.
5.
Throughout large part of 2006, CPI inflation was on the upper limit of the 3 ± 1
percent target, due mainly to the incidence of higher fuel prices, while core inflation
measures and other inflation trend indicators were close to 3 percent. However, during the
last quarter of 2006, the pace of price increases moderated substantially, and both CPI and
core inflation measures decreased below the 3 percent level. With decelerating inflation,
lower inflation expectations, and below trend GDP growth, in order to ensure inflation
convergence to 3 percent and after six months of stability in the policy rate, the Central Bank
decreased the monetary policy interest rate in January 2007 by 25 basis points to 5 percent.
6.
Over the course of the first five months of 2007, there have been both demand and
supply shocks changing materially the inflation outlook. On the one hand, the higher growth
rate of both domestic demand and GDP, in an overall context of diminished excess capacity
could put upward pressure in inflation. On the other hand, strong price shocks in specific
food items (grains and milk) and some increases in the price of oil and gasoline (instead of
expected strong declines) have increase inflation marginally above the 3 percent target, much
sooner than what was expected at the beginning of 2007. Inflation expectations remain well
anchored at 3 percent, as evidenced by the survey data presented in the staff report, and the
forward inflation compensation derived from indexed bonds. Furthermore, labor costs remain
well contained, as indicated by unit labor costs. The upside risks in terms of inflation are a
faster than anticipated closure of the output gap, the continuation of the observed supply
shocks to food products as well as oil and gasoline, potential second round effects from
higher prices of basic goods, and increases in the price of electricity. The downside risks to
inflation are an exchange rate appreciation and a faster resolution of the supply shocks seen
to date. So far, the authorities’ view is that risks remain balanced, and if the inflation outlook
shifts to a scenario in which the inflation forecast exceeds the 3 percent target over a 24
month period, the CBCh stands ready to act in order to fulfill its commitment to price
stability by reducing the monetary impulse.
Fiscal Policy
7.
In 2006, the central government posted an overall surplus of 7.7 percent of GDP as a
result of the continued application of the structural budget surplus rule established in 2001

3
and high copper prices. The surplus resulted from a 23.1 percent real increase in revenues
and a 6.9 percent real increase in public expenditure. A large budget surplus for a third
consecutive year has allowed further major improvement in the financial position of the
government via debt prepayments, and a significant increase in its assets from the savings of
copper windfall revenues. This has resulted in the government becoming a net creditor if
recognition bond liabilities (9.5 percent of GDP in December 2006) are excluded. The robust
state of public finances guarantees solvency and flexibility in the face of a deterioration in
the external environment in the future. In 2007 the central government is expected to reach a
surplus of 7.1 percent of GDP. Again in line with the fiscal policy framework, in 2007 public
expenditure is expected to increase by 9 percent in real terms, prioritizing social spending in
health, education and social housing.
8.
In order to manage copper windfall revenues prudently, in 2006 the Government
passed the Fiscal Responsibility Law (FRL), which created two funds for the management of
the government surpluses. The CBCh is currently responsible for the management of these
funds as a Fiscal Agent. The first of these funds – the Economic and Social Stabilization
Fund (ESSF) – was constituted with an initial deposit of USD 6 billion, and the second fund
– the Pension Reserve Fund (PRF) – was established with a USD 600 million initial deposit.
At the end of April 2007, the ESSF had a total of USD 7.2 billion in assets under
management, while the PRF had a total of USD 617 million. In the setup of the two funds,
the authorities have sought to establish institutions to manage the windfall gains from the
high copper prices of recent years. As part of the governance structure associated with the
setup of the ESSF and the PRF, an advisory body called the Financial Advisory Council
constituted by a six-member panel of independent economists was established in order to
provide advice to the Minister of Finance on the establishment of investment guidelines and
other matters related to the funds. The FRL also allowed the government to make use of its
surplus to recapitalize the CBCh by up to 0.5 percent of GDP for 5 years. The first payment
of USD 600 million was made in 2006, and a second payment of USD 735 million was made
recently.
9.
On May 21, during her annual address to Congress, President Bachelet announced a
reduction in the fiscal rule from a 1 percent to a 0.5 percent of GDP structural surplus target.
Such a change in the surplus target of the rule was the result of thorough review of the
conditions underlying the establishment of the 1 percent structural surplus target, namely the
structural deficit of the CBCh, the existence of future contingent liabilities of the government
arising from the state guarantee of minimum and basic pensions, and the vulnerabilities
associated with the currency mismatches of the government’s assets and liabilities.
10.
During the last 6 years, the 1 percent surplus target has provided a clear anchor to
fiscal policy and has allowed a significant reduction in the cost of accessing the international
capital markets as well as a secular fall in long-term interest rates. At the same time, the fall
in public debt and increased asset accumulation has resulted in a reduction in external
vulnerability, while the CBCh has also reduced its structural deficit. As a result, it was

4
deemed necessary to reduce the structural surplus target to 0.5 percent from 2008 onwards.
This adjustment flows from improvements in the conditions that led to the rule’s
establishment, and maintains the current rules-based framework for the conduct of fiscal
policy.
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
11.
Last January, the CBCh announced a refinement to its inflation targeting framework,
including the inflation target itself as well as the horizon in which monetary policy aims to
achieve the target. The previous framework was based on an inflation target in a range
between 2 and 4 percent. Under the new framework, price stability will be understood as
achieving most of the time a year-on-year CPI inflation rate of 3 percent, with a tolerance
range of ± 1 percent. This change in the definition of the inflation target provides a clear
signal that reassures the Central Bank’s commitment to price stability and also strengthens
the midpoint of the previous range as the economy’s relevant nominal anchor. Regarding the
policy horizon, the “12 to 24 months horizon” was replaced by a policy horizon “around twoyears time”. This change reflects that, on the one hand, the CBCh has been giving the
practice of monetary policy a higher weight to the two-year horizon, and on the other hand, it
takes into account the trend of other central banks in the definition of the policy horizon.
12.
In line with the developments of the inflation outlook, monetary policy has shifted
from an easing bias at the beginning of this year, which included a 25 bp. cut in January, to a
restrictive bias. As correctly assessed in the staff report, the remaining monetary stimulus
will probably be withdrawn in the near future, although as usual, monetary policy decisions
will continue to be contingent on incoming data, particularly on its impact on the inflation
outlook in a two-year horizon.
13.
The floating exchange rate regime creates greater scope for monetary policy, and
hence provides a buffer against external shocks. We concur with the staff’s assessment that
the exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals, and there is no evidence of
misalignment of the Chilean peso (CLP). In terms of the real exchange rate, fiscal policy has
played a key role due to the policy framework established to save abroad the windfall
revenues of the government from the copper price boom as it has helped significantly in
avoiding the loss of competitiveness that would have prevailed otherwise. These
developments have been instrumental in preventing the possibility of Dutch disease in light
of the large positive terms of trade shock from commodities prices.
Human capital
14.
The change in the fiscal rule’s target surplus from 1 percent to 0.5 percent of GDP
increases available government resources by approximately USD 740 million on a permanent
basis. Given the government’s emphasis on social spending USD 650 million will be spent
on education: the education voucher for children at mainly state-funded schools will rise by
15 percent, coupled with an increase in schools’ accountability with regard to the use of these

5
resources; the preferential education subsidy which targets the most vulnerable children in
the school system will increase; a family library program for four hundred thousand lowincome families will be established; existing scholarship programs for students of technical
careers will be expanded; and funds to improve the educational and financial capabilities of
municipal schools will be allocated.
Labor markets
15.
One of the key reforms that President Bachelet’s government is committed to is a
major reform of the pension system. Last year, a high-level technical commission headed by
the former Budget Secretary was setup with the purpose of gathering a wide range of reform
proposals from different relevant agents. Based on the proposals contained in the report, in
December of 2006 the government submitted to Congress the bill with the Reform to the
Pension System. The main elements of the reform is the establishment of a basic solidarity
pillar which includes the basic solidarity pension (BSP) and the solidarity pension
contribution (SPC) as explained in Box 1 of the report, the resolution of gender inequalities
of the system, incentives to incorporate independent workers to the pension system, and
increase competition by allowing new players to enter the system. The government’s goal is
to start paying the basic solidarity pensions by mid 2008. In order to achieve this goal, the
government reached an agreement with the parties of the government coalition to accelerate
the discussion in Congress, which implies that as early as August of this year the pension
reform bill would be discussed in the Senate after being discussed in the Lower House, to
become law by early 2008.
16.
In terms of labor markets, one of the latest developments which was not covered in
the report was the increase in the minimum wage of 6.7 percent, introducing a forward
looking clause so that if actual growth (in the period from the 4th quarter of 2006 to the 3rd
quarter of 2007) exceeds 5.8 percent in real terms, the minimum wage increases by an
additional 0.7 percent. The introduction of this forward-looking clause based on GDP growth
is seen by the government as a major step towards linking wage increases to economic
performance.
Financial Sector
17.
In June 2007 the Capital Markets II reform bill became law, introducing key
improvements to domestic capital markets in three broad areas: promoting access to venture
capital and funding for SMEs, strengthening financial market security, and promoting the
development and deepening of financial markets. In the first area, the law establishes tax
exemptions on capital gains from venture capital investments; promotes the participation of
the public sector and bank subsidiaries in venture capital funds; simplifies the legal
framework for the setup of both venture capital funds and companies; redesigns the current
system for the establishment of collateral; and extends for a further eight years the existing
tax benefit on trading of newly listed stocks.

6
18.
The second area of the project improves market security by simplifying the review
process for banks, insurance companies and AFPs license applications, centralizing it in the
corresponding Superintendency; improves the legal protection of financial supervisors; sets
higher custody requirements on securities so as to enhance the security of transactions
between market participants; establishes professional requirements for traders at
stockbrokers; and provides for the dematerialized issuance of securities.
19.
The third area of the project promotes the development of capital markets. Among
these measures are changes in the definition of sight and time deposits and reserve
requirements (that will now be based on effective net worth, rather than basic capital in line
with Basel II guidelines), allowing for further development of the money market; the
authorization of derivatives netting in case of bankruptcy; increases in investment limits for
insurance companies; modernization of the off-shore stock market; collective action clauses
for bond issuance; and a new tax benefit for mutual fund investors to promote saving,
competition and portfolio reallocation in the market segment.
Other Issues
20.
In March 2007, the government announced the Chile Invests Plan, a package of
measures aimed to boost investment, facilitate entrepreneurship, globalize the domestic
financial markets, further enhance trade integration, improve government effectiveness,
foster innovation and human capital, and address the country’s expanding energy needs. The
plan included a new accelerated depreciation tax benefit (still under review by the
legislature), the identification and elimination of bottlenecks in the investment process; and
an increased focus on the execution and quality of public investment. To facilitate
entrepreneurship, the government will indirectly provide long-term financing products for
small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) via the banking system, create a fund to
guarantee the investments of small and medium-sized enterprises, and will create a
standardized balance sheet reporting system for this sector that will be automatically
prepared for SMEs using tax information. To further the integration of domestic financial
markets, a derivatives law setting out a comprehensive tax framework will be submitted to
Congress; to move toward the use of the Chilean peso as an international currency the
government will facilitate connections to global settlement and custody systems, and will
reduce the administrative burdens on foreign investors in domestic markets.
Conclusion
21.
Chile’s rules-based policy framework for monetary and fiscal policy has proven to be
instrumental in the country’s efforts towards sustaining growth so as to improve the living
standards of the population, particularly those of low and middle-income Chileans, as
evidenced by the latest figures on poverty reduction and income distribution. According to
recently released figures, in the last 3 years the population in poverty fell by 5 percentage
points, from 18.7 to 13.7 percent, and in terms of income distribution the figures show the

7
largest improvement since 1990, as evidenced in by a fall in the Gini coefficient. These
improvements and the rules-based policy framework have been recognized recently by the
invitation extended to Chile in May to open discussions for membership of the OECD.
