Staff Report for the 2005 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2005 Consultation with Japan
Approved by Daniel Citrin and Carlo Cottarelli
July 26, 2005

•

This report is based on discussions held in Tokyo during May 16–26, 2005. The team
comprised Messrs. Citrin (Head), Zanello, Kramer, Komori, Wolfson, and N’Diaye,
Ms. Edison (all APD), and Messrs. McDonald (PDR) and Walker (ICM). Mr. Kitahara
(Alternate Executive Director) also took part in discussions. Supporting information and
analysis are provided in a companion Selected Issues paper.

•

The team met with Bank of Japan Governor Fukui; Vice Minister of Finance for
International Affairs Watanabe; and other senior officials at the Bank of Japan; Cabinet
Office; Ministries of Finance; Internal Affairs and Communications; Health, Labor and
Welfare; Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries; Economy, Trade and Industry; and Foreign
Affairs; the Financial Services Agency; the Industrial Revitalization Corporation of
Japan; the Headquarters for Postal Privatization; and with business and financial sector
representatives.

•

Japan maintains a floating exchange rate regime. Published data indicate that the
authorities last intervened in March 2004. The exchange system is free of restrictions on
the making of current international transactions, with the exceptions of those notified to
the Fund in accordance with Executive Board Decision 144-(52/51) (Annex I).

•

Data provided to the Fund are adequate for surveillance purposes, but some
statistical shortcomings complicate analysis of economic and fiscal developments
(Annex II). The recent move to a chain-weighted methodology for national income
accounts has improved the quality of economic statistics. However, consolidated fiscal
data are published with a long lag. The authorities plan to participate in a data ROSC in
September 2005.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background
•

Japan’s economy is regaining forward momentum after a pause during the latter part
of 2004. The external factors behind last year’s soft patch appear to be waning and a
number of economic indicators point to a revival in domestic demand. Mild deflation
persists. Notwithstanding downside risks, near-term prospects are for a moderately
paced expansion.

•

Structural advances on many fronts have strengthened the economy’s resilience.
Firms have made additional progress in deleveraging and shedding excess capital and
labor; banks have further reduced nonperforming loans; and labor markets have
become more dynamic.

•

Monetary policy continues to be highly accommodative. The Bank of Japan (BoJ) has
left unchanged the target range for current account balances under its quantitative
easing framework. Short-term interest rates remain at zero.

•

Fiscal consolidation was achieved last fiscal year but the deficit remains large and the
debt ratio on an unsustainable path. Prospective demands on the budget from an aging
society add urgency to the need for consolidation.

Key Issues and Policy Discussions
•

In spite of an improved near-term outlook, low trend growth and population aging
pose risks to longer-term prospects. Accordingly, discussions focused on policies to
bolster the underpinnings for stronger self-sustained growth.

•

On monetary policy, the mission endorsed the BoJ’s commitment to keep quantitative
easing in place until deflation is eliminated. There was broad agreement that the
transition to more normal monetary operations needs to be managed flexibly and clear
communication remains key to guiding market expectations.

•

Regarding fiscal policy, the mission and the authorities agreed that additional fiscal
savings relative to the budget would be desirable in FY2005. For the medium term,
the mission saw the need for a more ambitious—and better articulated—plan to
stabilize the debt ratio by the early 2010s.

•

Further structural and financial sector reforms are key to higher productivity and
potential growth. There is scope to improve the soundness and efficiency of the
financial system. Other priorities are to increase the flexibility of labor and product
markets and promote greater competition in sheltered sectors. The mission presented
illustrative model-based scenarios where modest productivity gains cushion the
impact of fiscal consolidation on growth and the current account, with benefits from
both domestic and global perspectives.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Over the past few years, Japan has made progress in addressing deep-seated
weaknesses. Supportive policies and a cyclical upswing have facilitated structural adjustment on many fronts. Firms have whittled away at excess capacity and overemployment;
corporate deleveraging has proceeded apace; labor markets have become more dynamic; and
banks’ balance sheets have improved significantly. While the legacies of the post-bubble
years have not been fully shed—witness the persistence of deflation and the breadth of
Japan’s fiscal problems—underlying trends appear more favorable now than they have been
for some time.
2.
With the immediate outlook brightening once again, policies need to take on
longer-term challenges. Recent data point to an improved near-term environment on the
heels of a soft patch in 2004. Notwithstanding some risks, prospects are good for a
moderately paced expansion over coming quarters. Looking beyond the cyclical recovery,
however, there remains the need to bolster the underpinnings for stronger self-sustained
growth. Policies need to address deflation, mounting fiscal imbalances, and low trend growth
in the context of a declining labor force. Accordingly, the 2005 Article IV discussions
focused on Japan’s longer-term challenges, and the difficult policy choices they will require.
3.
Medium-term fiscal and structural reforms are indeed at the center of the public
and political debate on economic issues. Prime Minister Koizumi came to power in 2001
with an ambitious platform to revitalize the economy, shift resources from the public to the
private sector, and further empower local government. Comprehensive reforms aimed at
improving the allocation of resources and strengthening the fiscal structure are crucial to
these goals. Several key initiatives are under way, notwithstanding some opposition, but the
unfinished agenda remains large. The prime minister’s term is scheduled to expire in 2006.
II. ECONOMIC AND POLICY BACKGROUND
4.
Following buoyant growth in the
latter half of 2003 and early 2004, GDP
growth slowed unexpectedly in the second
quarter of last year (Table 1 and Figure 1).
For 2004 as a whole, GDP rose 2.6 percent,
compared with 4.5 percent projected at the
time of the 2004 Article IV consultation last
July.1 About one-half of the shortfall reflected
a shift to a chain-weighted methodology—

These figures are based on quarterly GDP data. The official outturn based on annual data
was 2.7 percent growth in 2004 (or 3.7 percent under the fixed-weight methodology).

-5-

growth on the old methodology was 3.6 percent. The rest was associated with an
unanticipated fall in partner country demand, owing to a slowdown in the global IT market as
well as higher oil prices, and weaker private domestic demand.
5.
Economic activity rebounded sharply in the first quarter of 2005. First-quarter
GDP growth amounted to 4.9 percent SAAR, in part reflecting temporary factors such as a
bounce-back in private consumption following a weather-related weak previous quarter and
some inventory buildup. Recent indicators such as industrial production, retail sales, and
foreign machinery orders point to a continued expansion going forward, albeit at a more
moderate pace than in the first quarter.
6.
Notwithstanding the recovery, mild deflation persists. Core inflation (which
excludes fresh food) was -0.2 percent y/y in

Exports have been sluggish since
mid-2004. Exports to the European Union,
the United States, and the rest of Asia all
stalled during last year, although exports to
the United States recovered in early 2005.
In addition, exports to China have continued
to expand steadily, albeit at a slower pace
than in the earlier part of this decade.
Indeed, China is an increasingly important
trading partner, with its share of exports
more than doubling since 2001 to 13 percent
at present.

8.
Despite the export slowdown, the external balance continues to reach new highs
(Table 2 and Figure 4). The current account surplus was $172 billion (3.7 percent of GDP) in
2004. Export values were up some 20 percent in dollar terms for the year, partly because of
carryover from strong export growth in late 2003. Imports remained robust through the year,
reflecting higher energy prices as well as steady demand for consumer and IT-related goods.
In addition, investment income benefited from buoyant performance of foreign subsidiaries

-6-

of Japanese companies and rising overseas portfolio holdings, boosting invisibles receipts. In
the capital account, purchases of Japanese equities by foreigners picked up, while Japanese
purchases of foreign bonds—particularly by investment trusts—remained large. Accumulation of official reserves slowed, as intervention ended in Spring 2004 after setting new
records in 2003 and the first quarter of 2004 (Box 1). Foreign assets rose to 36 percent of
GDP by end-2004, including official reserves of $834 billion. In the first quarter of 2005, the
current account surplus rose further to $180 billion at annual rates. Export growth remained
sluggish, and import demand weakened, while the balances on nonfactor services and
investment income improved significantly.
9.
The yen has been broadly stable against the U.S. dollar and on a multilateral
basis. Over the past 12 months, the bilateral exchange rate vis-à-vis the dollar has been in a
range of ¥102 to ¥115. Appreciation pressures emerged toward the end of 2004, driven
largely by broad-based dollar weakness, but receded on expectations of faster tightening by
the U.S. Federal Reserve. In effective terms, the nominal and real exchange rates have been
little changed over the past 12 months. Unit labor cost pressures have been muted compared
with those in partner countries, and moreover in light of Japan’s already sizeable external
surplus, competitiveness is not a concern at present. Indeed, staff estimates, prepared in the
context of the periodic Coordinating Group on Exchange Rates exercise, suggest that the yen
remains significantly undervalued from a medium-term perspective. In particular, under
unchanged exchange rates, in the medium term the current account will likely exceed levels
consistent with savings-investment fundamentals.
10.
Pressure on labor markets from job shedding is slowly abating (Figure 2). The
unemployment rate is at a six-year low, the ratio of job offers to applicants has continued to
hover at post-bubble highs, and the Tankan corporate survey indicates declining labor market
slack. Employment of regular workers is firming, as the past trend toward hiring temporary
and contract workers begins to ebb. Thanks in part to the shift back toward regular workers
(who are more highly paid), real wages have recently bottomed out, with positive
implications for future income growth.
11.
Progress in corporate restructuring has continued. Cash flow and profits remain
buoyant, bankruptcies have fallen to a ten-year low, and leverage continues to decline
(Box 2). Furthermore, the recovery in the corporate sector continues to broaden beyond large
export-oriented manufacturers to include

Box 1. Japan: Exchange Rate Policy and Intervention
In Japan, the Ministry of Finance (MoF) has the legal authority to conduct foreign exchange
market interventions to achieve exchange rate stability. The Bank of Japan (BoJ) executes the
interventions on behalf of the MoF, which decides the amounts and the method of intervention. In the
case of foreign currency buying operations, yen funds are raised through sales of yen assets issued by
the MoF (financing bills). Such interventions therefore are, in principle, sterilized: the pursuit of
interventions on behalf of the MOF does not preclude the BoJ from achieving its domestic monetary
objectives. Interventions could be “unsterilized” through expansionary open market operations.
Compared to the United States and the euro area, Japan stands out for its active use of foreign
exchange market intervention as a policy instrument. Since 1991 the BoJ has intervened on behalf
of the MoF on 340 days. By contrast, the Federal Reserve has intervened on 22 days over the same
period, and the European Central Bank only on four days since its establishment in 1998. Most MoF
interventions have been to limit a yen appreciation.
The frequency and size of interventions
have varied through time. From early
1991 to mid-1995 interventions were
generally small but frequent. From mid1995 to end-2002, interventions became
infrequent but large. Finally, in 2003
through March 2004, interventions were
both large and very frequent. At the peak,
they reached daily amounts in excess of
$10 billion. The cumulative amount of
dollars purchased over this last period was
about $180 billion. No intervention has
taken place since March 2004.

There is evidence that intervention has had some impact on yen movements. Measuring the
effectiveness of official intervention is difficult, since many interrelated factors affect the exchange
rate at any time. This said, several researchers have concluded that Japanese intervention has had (at
best) a modest and temporary impact on short-term movements in the yen/dollar exchange rate. In
particular, one study found that intervention of about ¥2.5 trillion (or about $250 billion) on average
moved the yen/dollar exchange rate by ¥1 or so, or about 1 percent at the current exchange rate.1 This
impact may have been somewhat larger in the late 1990s, when foreign exchange intervention was
often coordinated among major countries.

Box 2. Japan: Continued Improvements in Corporate Sector Health
Further progress has been made in addressing the corporate sector excesses of the 1990s. Firms
have continued to trim labor costs from high levels, scale back fixed asset overhangs, and reduce
debt. Meanwhile, recent years have seen a sharp fall in the debt of bankrupt companies, which is now
about 1½ percent of GDP, not far above the 1980s average of about 1 percent of GDP. These
improvements were facilitated by a variety of factors: enhanced regulatory pressure on banks to deal
with nonperforming loans; enhancements to the framework for corporate sector restructuring; and a
strengthening economic environment.
Profitability has continued to rise on a broad basis. Firms of all sizes, in both manufacturing and
nonmanufacturing industries, have enjoyed a sharp pickup in profitability. Indeed, it is notable that
this trend continued through the 2004 soft patch, suggesting that structural as well as cyclical factors
have been at play. For all categories of firms, the ratio of current profits to sales is the highest since
the late 1980s; indeed, for large companies and nonmanufacturers, it exceeds the late-1980s peak.
In addition, corporate deleveraging has continued apace. Debt/sales ratios have recently declined
for both large and small firms in manufacturing and nonmanufacturing sectors alike. By and large,
leverage by this measure has fallen to around levels last seen more than a decade ago. However, small
firms’ leverage remains around the 1990s average.
All in all, the picture is one of a corporate sector that is in better health than in a number of
years. In some sectors, Japanese firms are in the best shape since the bubble period by some
measures.

Box 3. Japan: Update on the Banking System
The financial condition of the banking system has continued to improve. Nonperforming loans
(NPLs) have declined sharply, with the NPL ratio at major banks falling from more than 8 percent in
FY2001 to below 3 percent. Capital quality improved, with the capital adequacy ratio rising to
11.6 percent, and the share of deferred tax assets in capital declining. The improvement at regional
banks has been more gradual, however.
Banking system profitability has increased, but remains low by international standards. Owing
to reduced credit costs, major banks earned a combined net income of ¥575 billion in FY2004,
following losses in the previous three years. Nonetheless, underlying profitability (excluding credit
costs and gains on bond and stock holdings) remains low. Compared with their industrial country
peers, Japanese banks earn narrow net interest margins and low noninterest revenues.
Banks are now less vulnerable to market shocks. Banks have taken steps to reduce their equity
holdings, which are now below the level of Tier 1 capital. However, bond holdings have increased
slightly.
Heightened supervisory efforts have contributed to the improvement in the banking system.
Ongoing corporate restructuring efforts and the improved economic outlook have helped reduce the
overhang of bad debts. Policy efforts have also played a central role, notably through the 2002
Program for Financial Revival. Policies have been broadly in line with staff recommendations,
including in the 2003 Financial Sector Stability Assessment. The priorities have included:
•

Improve recognition and provisioning of bad loans. The Financial Services Agency (FSA) has
broadened the application of forward-looking discounted cash flow analysis in assessing loan
quality. Heightened scrutiny of loan books through special inspections of select borrowers has led
to better bad loan recognition and more appropriate provisioning.

•

Strengthen bank capital. The FSA has requested greater scrutiny of deferred tax assets by
auditors, and is considering rules to limit the share of DTAs in regulatory capital.

•

Recapitalize banks subject to strict conditions. Legislation allowing regional banks to apply for
public capital injections was adopted in 2004. No applications have been made yet, although the
scheme could be used to support planned regional bank mergers.

•

Reduce the role of government financial institutions (GFIs). The authorities are in the process of
deciding the basic framework for GFI reform, with a view to cutting outstanding GFI loans in
half. A blueprint for the privatization of Japan Post—by far the largest GFI—is currently before
the Diet.

Going forward, policies need to shift toward promoting the revitalization of the banking system.
A key priority is to raise core profitability in the banking system. Planned measures to expand the
range of products that banks can offer will be helpful. In addition, reduced reliance on real estate
collateral and improved risk management systems will help prevent a return of the bad loan problem,
and help prepare Japanese banks for the adoption of Basel II. The FSA has adopted a new Program
for Further Financial Reform to guide future financial sector reforms along these lines, and is in the
process of elaborating more detailed policies.

- 10 -

banks more than met the PFR’s goal of halving the NPL ratio to around 4 percent by the
program’s expiration in March 2005. The pace of decline in bank lending has slowed and,
according to the Tankan survey, borrowers perceive an increased willingness to lend. In
addition, the blanket guarantee on bank deposits was lifted at end-March, with no signs of
strain.2 Regional banks, which have been subject to a less rigorous action plan than major
banks, have also made progress, albeit more slowly, in cutting bad loans. Nonetheless, the
process of revitalizing the banking system has further to go. The quality of bank capital is
weakened by deferred tax assets (DTAs), which have fallen steadily but still account for
about a fourth of major banks’ Tier 1 capital.3 Core profitability remains low, leaving banks
vulnerable to shocks and ill-positioned to perform effective financial intermediation.

Asset market developments have
been relatively uneventful (Figure 3). The
Nikkei has been broadly flat over the past
year. The ten-year JGB yield declined in the
summer of 2004 as economic data
disappointed, and has remained low. There
are indications that land prices may be
bottoming out, with clear signs of revival in
central Tokyo.

Monetary policy remains highly
accommodative (Table 3). The Bank of Japan (BoJ) has provided significant liquidity under
its quantitative easing framework, keeping current account balances at a high level and shortterm interest rates at zero.4 It has repeatedly stressed that the policy will remain in place until
deflation is defeated. In May, the BoJ decided to allow temporary undershooting of its target
range for current account balances in the face of seasonal volatility in the demand for
liquidity. The move was generally perceived by markets as a technical step and not as a

Nonetheless, risks remain biased to the downside. Global growth could weaken,
especially if new spikes in oil prices occur.7 In addition, renewed upward pressure on the yen

Japan has become more energy efficient over time. Since 1980, oil imports have declined
from 5 percent to 1¼ percent of GDP. Japan’s oil utilization per dollar of real GDP is the
lowest among advanced economies. According to staff estimates, shocks that could reduce

could dampen external demand and exacerbate deflation. On the domestic side, risks appear
more balanced: the outlooks for consumption and business investment hinge mainly on the
buoyancy of confidence and the prospects for wages and profits growth, which staff gauge as
roughly equally likely to exceed or fall short of expectations.
18.
Over the medium term, with the output gap now having narrowed, growth is
envisaged to slow to potential, with population aging and fiscal consolidation shaping
the economic landscape. In the staff’s baseline projections, growth moderates to potential,
estimated at 1.5 percent, by 2008 (Box 4). Relatively low potential growth reflects muted
total factor productivity, as well as a continued decline in the working-age population.
Population aging also pushes down the household savings rate, contributing to a steady
decline in the private savings-investment balance (with corporate savings and investment
essentially stable).8 However, a rising public savings-investment balance offsets this trend,
with the effect that the current account balance is broadly unchanged over the medium term.

consolidation, and elements of a strategy to stabilize the debt over the medium term are in
place. However, with modest underlying growth and mounting demographic pressures, the
outlook remains vulnerable. Thus, the discussions focused on measures to boost productivity
and rein in fiscal imbalances. There was agreement that monetary policy should continue to
be geared to defeating deflation; fiscal policy should stabilize the debt while making room
for growing budgetary demands from an aging society; and structural policies should further
pursue the benefits of greater competition and flexibility in factor and product markets.
20.
During recent consultations, the staff and the authorities have agreed on the
main policy priorities (Box 5). In recent years, the broad thrust of policies has been in line
with staff advice, including an expansionary monetary stance, fiscal consolidation, and
tighter bank regulation. By and large, however, the authorities have preferred a more gradual
approach than staff, partly out of concern that aggressive reforms could stifle economic
activity, and partly owing to a preference for policy flexibility.
21.
The mission emphasized that putting Japan on a higher medium-term growth
path would also help strengthen the world economy and reduce global imbalances.
Medium-term fiscal consolidation is an essential part of the required strategy. In the short
run, fiscal consolidation could have a modest negative impact on growth, as well as raise
national savings (thereby leading to a larger current account surplus). But in the longer run,
putting the debt on a sustainable path is crucial to achieving a sustained expansion—in
particular, by limiting the risk of higher real interest rates and a more burdensome future
adjustment. The other essential element of the medium-term strategy is structural reform,
which is necessary to mitigate the effects of population aging on potential growth and bolster
Japan’s productive capacity. In addition to making the global economy more resilient, more
robust growth in domestic demand stemming from such reforms would help to reduce
Japan’s large current account surplus. In the context of concerted policy efforts in other
countries to address external imbalances, this strategy could contribute to a smooth resolution
of global imbalances, and thereby reduce the risk of a disorderly adjustment in currency
markets.
22.
To illustrate the long-run gains from a comprehensive package of fiscal
consolidation and structural reforms, the staff prepared indicative scenarios using the
Fund’s Global Economic Model.9 The analysis examines the effects of a policy package
combining (a) a pickup in productivity of ½ percent per year—the simulated payoff from
reforms—and (b) an additional ¼ percent of GDP per year in deficit reduction (as discussed
below, this adjustment is estimated by staff to be necessary, over and above the authorities’
intended path, to stabilize the debt over the medium term). In the simulations, a small upfront

Box 5. Japan: Policy Dialogue
In recent years, the Japanese authorities and the Fund have agreed on the main policy priorities, but the
authorities have generally favored more moderate steps than the Fund, partly out of concern for the risks that
stronger actions might pose.1 The staff has had a frank and open dialogue with the authorities.
Monetary policy
Fund recommendations: Maintain highly accommodative monetary conditions, including through increases
in the quantitative target, and possibly through unsterilized intervention; enhance the communications
strategy through an inflation objective and other measures.
Policy developments: In the past few years, monetary policy has been eased and sizeable interventions have
been made, although the Bank of Japan (BoJ) eschewed more aggressive approaches owing to concerns
about the risks to (for example) its balance sheet. On communications strategy, the BoJ views an inflation
objective as an option and continues an active internal debate on the pros and cons of this and other
approaches.
Fiscal policy
Fund recommendations: Employ both spending restraint and revenue enhancement to make progress toward
medium-term fiscal sustainability; enhance the credibility of the authorities’ consolidation plans by
specifying a primary surplus target and measures to achieve it; in the near term, save any stronger-thanexpected revenues and explore possible expenditure savings.
Policy developments: The structural deficit was reduced by about 1 percent of GDP over FY2001–04,
reflecting both expenditure and revenue measures (and in FY2004, windfall revenues that were saved).
However, the authorities have been reluctant to adopt a more specific medium-term plan, citing a need for
flexibility (in the late 1990s, a fiscal program had to be abandoned soon after it was adopted, owing to the
onset of a recession).
Financial and corporate sectors
Fund recommendations: Strengthen supervision and regulation to expeditiously resolve banking sector
weaknesses (including in the context of the 2003 FSSA); take steps to improve the environment for bank
profitability, in particular by leveling the playing field with public financial institutions.
Policy developments: The government’s 2002 Program for Financial Revival fostered a significant
improvement in the health of major banks, although the Fund favored bolder reforms. In addition,
weaknesses remain in the financial system: regional banks continue to lag, and bank profitability remains
low. Meanwhile, a government plan to privatize Japan Post could reduce competition from public financial
institutions. The plan is now in the final stages of legislative deliberation.
Trade policy
Fund recommendations: Reduce high levels of agricultural protection to ameliorate the costs to Japanese
consumers and developing countries; move forward with trade liberalization in a multilateral context.
Policy developments: The authorities have felt that agricultural liberalization should be gradual and take
account of nontrade concerns such as food security and environmental protection. They have seen bilateral
agreements as opportunities to move forward with objectives that made little progress in the Doha Round.
Structural reforms
Fund recommendations: Enhance labor market flexibility, advance regulatory reform, and accelerate public
enterprise reforms.
Policy developments: The authorities have broadly agreed with these priorities. However, progress has been
mixed, and much remains to be done.

structural reforms offset the potential

23.
A stronger pickup in productivity—corresponding to more vigorous structural
reforms—would yield concomitantly larger benefits. The assumed payoff from structural
reforms of ½ percent per year is toward the cautious end of estimates in the literature, which
range from ¼ to 2½ percent of GDP (see Annex IV). With a more optimistic one-percent per
year pickup in productivity growth and the same fiscal effort as in the previous scenario, the
current account surplus declines by about ½ percent of GDP in the near term. In addition,
after ten years the level of debt is 24 percentage points of GDP lower than under the noreform baseline—thus, structural reforms facilitate the task of stabilizing the debt.
Monetary policy: Defeating deflation and guiding market expectations
24.
The authorities and the mission agreed that the priority for monetary policy
remained tackling deflation. BoJ officials stressed the continued commitment to maintain
the quantitative easing framework until actual inflation is nonnegative for a few months and a
majority of Board members forecast positive inflation (on the basis of the year-on-year
change in the core CPI). Even then, quantitative easing may stay in place if circumstances
dictate. Accordingly, the BoJ has maintained the present level of the current account target
since January 2004 to signal its commitment to easy monetary policy.
25.
That said, there has been increasing discussion in recent months about whether
to lower the quantitative policy target. On the one hand, with dwindling precautionary
demand for liquidity, reducing the target would probably not push up short-term interest
rates. In addition, the fund-supplying operations needed to maintain the target exacerbate
distortions in financial markets and reduce the BoJ’s operational flexibility by lengthening

- 17 -

the maturity of its operations.10 On the other hand, markets could misread a reduction in the
balance as signaling an intention to move toward an early tightening, and there remains a
need to defeat deflation once and for all. On balance, the BoJ has decided to leave the target
unchanged to signal unambiguously the monetary stance and its intentions.
26.
Looking further ahead, it was agreed that skillful communication will be
essential to guide expectations as monetary conditions and operations normalize.11 BoJ
officials noted their recent efforts in this regard, including more explicit public discussion of
the considerations surrounding the conduct of monetary policy as well as a longer horizon for
policy members’ forecasts in the biannual Outlook Reports. The mission observed that open
discourse by BoJ officials on the pros and cons of different policy options appears to have
helped reassure markets of the intention to maintain easy monetary conditions for as long as
necessary. This was evidenced by a smooth market response to the recent adjustment to
monetary operations. Going forward, continued communication along these lines could lay
the groundwork for eventual reductions in the quantitative target.
27.
More generally, there was a shared view that it is important to maintain
flexibility in monetary operations and strategy during the transition back to inflation.
Monetary operations will need to shift back to using interest rates as a policy tool, as
inflation reappears; however, the risks of remaining accommodative for too long are
outweighed by the costs of a premature tightening. That said, it would be inappropriate to
specify in advance a concrete strategy for future monetary operations, which would need to
be tailored to evolving financial and economic conditions. With regard to strategy, the
mission discussed whether more explicit elaboration of the BoJ’s medium-term inflation
objective, without a commitment to achieve it over any specific timeframe, could allow due
flexibility while helping to anchor inflation expectations during the transition. BoJ officials
acknowledged that this was one option for communicating policy objectives, but nevertheless
emphasized the practical difficulties of identifying an appropriate numerical target, partly
because of the measurement problems inherent to price indexes. They also expressed
concerns that even a nonbinding objective would be interpreted by markets as a rigid target
that the BoJ was obliged to achieve in the short term. Accordingly, introducing such an
objective could adversely affect the BoJ’s credibility if inflation did not quickly rise to the
target. This was especially a concern in light of remaining weaknesses in the transmission
mechanism. The team agreed that, given the stated commitment to maintain zero interest
rates until inflation turned positive, the benefit of elaborating a medium-term inflation
objective at present was unclear. Nevertheless, the mission encouraged the BoJ to keep the
option open for the future.
10

Financial market distortions include downward pressure on bank profits due to very low
spreads and reduced transactions in private money markets (with overnight interest rates near
zero, money market dealing is unprofitable).

11

- 18 -

28.
The mission also discussed the possible use of unsterilized intervention to combat
deflationary pressures if the yen strengthened. In its view, smoothing operations could be
warranted if market conditions turned disorderly. In addition, with the effectiveness of more
conventional monetary policy tools hampered and the room for fiscal maneuver limited,
unsterilized intervention would be an option if appreciation pressures threatened to stall the
recovery or significantly worsen deflation. However, from both domestic and global standpoints, unsterilized intervention would be warranted only under extraordinary circumstances.
The economy is better placed now than a year ago to cope with a stronger currency, while its
external surplus has grown. Also, from a longer-term perspective, heightened competition in
international markets has probably reduced pass through from exchange rates to final goods
prices over time—implying that yen appreciation would put less downward pressure on
Japanese domestic prices than it had in the past.12
29.
The authorities broadly concurred with this assessment, and stressed that
Japan’s exchange rate policy remained unchanged. It remains grounded in the notion that
exchange rates should reflect fundamentals, since excess volatility harms economic growth.
Accordingly, the authorities considered that, in the event of disorderly fluctuations in the
foreign exchange market, intervention could still be warranted.
Fiscal policy: Stabilizing the debt and making room for population aging
30.
Large fiscal imbalances and growing pressure on the budget from population
aging create risks for medium-term growth. Since 2000, net public debt has grown from
60 percent to 80 percent of GDP, and absent significant further fiscal measures, is set to rise
further over the medium term. Avoiding an upward spiral in debt will require, among other
measures, steps to contain pressures on public social security spending from population
aging. Government projections show that under unchanged policies, such spending will
double in nominal terms over the next two decades—an increase of 2.5 percentage points of
GDP—reflecting higher healthcare outlays (comprising medical and long-term care).
Addressing this situation will require difficult policy choices (Box 6).
31.
The authorities see a growing public consensus in Japan that the debt situation
needs to be addressed. A focal point for discussion is the Cabinet Office’s medium-term
analysis, which envisages achieving balance in the primary deficit excluding social security
by the early 2010s. This path would stabilize the debt/GDP ratio and subsequently put it on a
slightly declining path. In this context, it is also increasingly recognized among officials and

12

Research has found that the pass through from dollar depreciation to U.S. import prices has
declined significantly during the past ten years or so, possibly owing in part to increased
competition from China and other new entrants. See Marazzi and others, “Exchange Rate
Pass Through to U.S. Import Prices: Some New Evidence,” International Finance Discussion
Paper 883, U.S. Federal Reserve Board of Governors (April 2005).

- 19 Box 6. Japan’s Longer-Term Fiscal Challenges and the Authorities’ Plans
In January 2005, the Cabinet Office (CAO)
released projections for the public finances
excluding social security. The projections
envisaged a primary surplus of 0.1 percent of GDP
in FY2012 for the central and local government
(a concept approximating the general government
minus social security). This adjustment would
stabilize the gross debt ratio from FY2007.1 The
projections assume progress in structural reforms
that generate gains in productivity, as well as some
fiscal efforts to restrain the deficit.

than in the authorities’ plan) would require a
primary surplus excluding social security near 3 percent of GDP (see Annex III).
A recent government report indicates that the public finances including social security will
continue to deteriorate under current policies. In May 2005, the Fiscal System Council (an advisory
group to the Finance Minister) simulated the implications of maintaining current revenue and
expenditure policies:
¾ The primary deficit of the central government’s general account (which is a focal
point of Japan’s fiscal system) would rise to
¥25 trillion in FY2015, from ¥16 trillion in
FY2005.
¾ In addition, government expenditures on
social security benefits (both inside and
outside the general account) will rise to
almost ¥60 trillion (8 percent of GDP) in
FY2025 from ¥27½ trillion (5½ percent of
GDP) in FY2005.

The authorities recognize that bold steps will
be needed to address these challenges. The Fiscal System Council estimates that relying only on
expenditure measures to fill the gap would result in a 30 percent across-the-board spending cut.
Alternatively, assuming no other actions are taken, the consumption tax rate would need to be
increased to 19 percent (from 5 percent). Fiscal adjustment is therefore likely to involve a mix of
spending and revenue measures.

projections—will require difficult measures on both revenue and expenditure sides.
32.
The mission supported the authorities’ aims and recognized the significant
efforts that would be required, but still saw a need for a more ambitious medium-term
consolidation program. In addition to social security reforms, a significant primary surplus
excluding social security is likely to be needed to stabilize the debt, as real interest rates may
be higher than in the authorities’

through the early 2010s (a cumulative adjustment of 7 percentage points of GDP).13
Moreover, it will be desirable to reduce the debt over time, given its already high level—
thus, any savings over and above that average should be used for that purpose. The
authorities expressed reservations about the possible adverse macroeconomic effects of
stronger deficit reduction, but the mission considered that the impact of an additional annual
¼ percentage point of GDP in fiscal withdrawal over the medium term would be manageable,
given that the economy has become more resilient and that the fiscal multipliers are in all
likelihood small (Box 7). The mission also discussed the question of whether fiscal rules
could bolster the credibility of the authorities’ plans, as they have in other countries. The
authorities were skeptical about the usefulness of such rules, citing the experience in 1998
when a rigid fiscal program had to be abandoned shortly after its introduction in the face of
faltering growth. In their view, the credibility of fiscal policy would hinge most of all on the
steady implementation of deficit reduction. In any event, the mission and authorities agreed
that implementation of fiscal consolidation would need to take due account of evolving
economic circumstances.
33.
As for specific measures, the authorities view further reining in expenditures as
a first priority. Although the scope to trim discretionary spending is limited, such cuts are
necessary to limit the size of tax hikes, streamline the public sector, and convince the public
that all possible measures are being considered prior to raising taxes. With regard to more
specific steps, the authorities are discussing expenditure measures in four areas:

13

A one-percentage point increase in the long-run real interest rate, or a one-percentage point
decline in the long-run real growth rate, would increase by roughly one percent of GDP the
primary balance needed to stabilize the debt (see Annex III).

- 21 -

Box 7. How Much Does Fiscal Policy Affect Economic Activity in Japan?
Studies of fiscal policy effectiveness generally find that fiscal multipliers in Japan are
modest.1 Estimated multipliers are typically around unity or less in the short run, and often
smaller in the long run. Broadly speaking, a ¥100 cut in expenditure is estimated to reduce
GDP by around ¥100 to ¥125 in the short run, while a ¥100 increase in the tax burden is
estimated to reduce GDP by about ¥25 to ¥50. Long-run multipliers are usually estimated to
be even smaller. Calculation using the Global Economic Model, for example, shows a shortrun fiscal multiplier of about 1 and a long-run multiplier of about zero.
However, the impact of future deficit reduction could be different than suggested by
these estimates. The estimates depend on underlying economic assumptions (such as the
sensitivity of investment to interest rates and the responsiveness of labor supply and savings
to after-tax income) which are hard to measure. Also, fiscal multipliers may change with
economic circumstances. Accordingly:
¾

The effects could be larger if past cuts to public investment eliminated unproductive
spending, but future cuts impact core infrastructure, thereby lowering growth
prospects. Also, the scope for an offsetting easing of monetary policy is more limited
than in the past.

¾

The effects could be smaller if fiscal consolidation lowers the risk premium and real
interest rates significantly. In addition, taxpayers might pay for expected future tax
hikes by drawing down savings instead of cutting spending, limiting the impact on
aggregate demand. Indeed, research finds that in OECD countries, a one-percentagepoint of GDP increase in the deficit elicits a rise in private savings of one-third to
one-half that size.

On balance, steady fiscal consolidation as advocated by staff in this report will
probably dampen output somewhat over the medium term. With a multiplier of 0.5 to
1.0, additional annual deficit reduction of ¼ percentage point of GDP would reduce growth
by 0.25 to 0.13 percent at the margin. To the extent that taxes bear part of the adjustment and
have a smaller multiplier, the drag would be toward the lower end of this range. In addition,
more decisive consolidation could yield an implicit payoff by forestalling a rise in real
interest rates and a larger future adjustment. In some countries, fiscal consolidation has even
been associated with output expansions, as it has reduced risk premia (see WEO, May 1995,
Box 2). However, such an “expansionary fiscal contraction” seems unlikely in Japan, as risk
premia and interest rates are already very low.

•

Social security: The 2004 reforms to the pension system put its finances on a stable
footing under current demographic assumptions, but healthcare expenditures are set
to continue rising. The government is discussing measures for healthcare spending,
with the aim to devise specific proposals by end-2005.

•

Local government finances: Devolution of tax and spending responsibilities from
central to local government in the context of “trinity reforms” has already achieved
net savings, albeit modest (a cumulative cut in subsidies of 0.1 percent of GDP during
FY2004–05). For FY2006 further tax devolution and subsidy reform is envisaged: the
overall objective of the trinity reform is to shift the financing of ¥4 trillion worth of
subsidies to local governments through the devolution of ¥3 trillion in tax authority
over 2004–06. So far, subsidy reform has entailed broad agreement among the parties
concerned to devolve spending of about ¥2½ trillion (of which ¥0.7 trillion is to take
place in FY2006). The corresponding reallocation of the tax base (including from the
national income tax to the local inhabitant tax) is to be decided in FY2006. Going
forward, increasing local accountability and efficiency through reforms of the system
of block grants (the Local Allocation Tax) could have larger effects over time.

•

The public sector wage bill: In the regions, public servants’ pay is somewhat above
private-sector levels; in addition, scope might exist to reduce head count.

•

Public investment: Since its 1995 peak, spending has been reduced from 6½ percent
to a projected 3½ percent of GDP in 2005, but there was room for additional
reductions (it remains slightly above the OECD average). The Cabinet Office’s
projections assume a 3 percent cut in FY2006.

34.
The staff stressed that revenue measures would likely need to comprise a
significant part of the medium-term adjustment. For FY2006, steps could include
streamlining the income tax system and broadening the tax base (the number of exemptions
has risen dramatically over past decades). For FY2007 and beyond, the consumption tax
could be raised, which would yield about ½ percent of GDP in revenue for each percentage
point increase in the tax rate. The rise might be implemented in modest increments so as to
limit the drag on economic activity. Because the prime minister had vowed not to increase
the tax during his term, a hike is unlikely before 2007.
35.
While comprehensive
expenditure and tax reforms are being
formulated, the authorities are taking
measures to restrain the deficit. In the
FY2005 budget, a past cut in income
taxes has been partly rolled back, with
effect from January 2006. In addition,
many areas of discretionary spending in
the general account of the central
government have been trimmed relative
to FY2004 initial budget levels—with

cuts of 2 to 7 percent in education, investment, and other general expenditures—although
nondiscretionary spending has grown.14 Overall, these measures bring about a projected
improvement in the gap between general account revenues and general expenditures of
0.2 percent of GDP (comparing the projected FY2005 outturn with the revised FY2004
budget). With the primary deficit of the social security system unchanged and the local
government balance improving by 0.2 percent of GDP on the back of buoyant revenues, this
translates into a projected reduction of 0.4 percent of GDP in the general government
primary deficit (staff estimates).15
36.
Regarding the near-term fiscal position, the mission encouraged the authorities
to make significant further headway in deficit reduction. The staff projects that the
primary deficit will decline over FY2005 and FY2006 based on existing measures and a
continued expansion. However, the structural balance is projected to decline only slightly in
FY2005, and staff therefore expressed the view that further savings would be desirable. The
mission and the authorities agreed that in FY2005 any tax windfall should be saved, and that
there is no need for expansionary measures in this year’s supplementary budget, assuming
the expansion continues as envisaged. Looking to FY2006, the mission encouraged the
authorities to make additional significant progress in the context of the forthcoming budget,
reducing the primary deficit excluding social security by ¾ percent of GDP or more. The
mission deemed this adjustment feasible based on existing and prospective policy measures,
namely the further rollback of past income tax cuts, measures to broaden the income tax
base, and continued cuts in discretionary spending (including public investment).
37.
The mission expressed the hope that the authorities would achieve fiscal
consolidation without further impinging on development assistance, with every effort to
raise it toward the UN target. Net ODA disbursement was around 0.2 percent of GNI in
FY2004, slightly reduced from FY2003 and below the UN target of 0.7 percent. The
authorities noted that the reduction in net ODA during recent years reflects heavy loan
repayments; gross ODA has risen for the past four years. In addition, a significant part of
development assistance, including lending activities, is financed off-budget.
Financial system: Shifting from stabilization to revitalization
38.
Strengthened regulation, along with the economic recovery, has stabilized the
financial system. The main balance-sheet weaknesses stemming from the bubble period—

The general account is the basis for the central government budget. It includes most central
government revenues and some spending, with (for example) social security premia included
in “special accounts.”

15

The staff’s macroeconomic estimates compare the estimated outturn for FY2004 (final data
are not yet available) with the projected outturn for FY2005. In formulating the budget, the
authorities’ analysis focuses on the difference between the current year’s and prior year’s
initial budgets.

- 24 -

high NPLs, excessive market risk exposures, and weak capital—have been reduced to
manageable levels for the major banks. In addition, regional banks have made slower, yet
steady, progress in dealing with NPLs. Thanks to the attendant improved confidence in
banking system stability, the end-March rollback in deposit insurance coverage went
smoothly.
39.
Accordingly, financial sector policies are shifting emphasis to revitalization. The
Program for Further Financial Reform (PFFR) announced in 2004 proposes a wide range of
policy measures to improve the soundness and efficiency of Japan’s financial system, in line
with the longer-run trend toward liberalization and internationalization of capital markets
(Box 8).16 For example, banks will be allowed to offer a wider range of products, which
could support core profitability.17 The PFFR incorporates an enhanced focus on risk management, including proposals to encourage banks to rely less on real estate collateral and
guarantees. In addition, the program aims to enhance investor protection through a comprehensive Investment Services Law covering the full range of financial services (banking,
securities, and insurance). It also includes insurance industry measures, such as a review of
the solvency margin standard and strengthened policy holder protection.
40.
The mission encouraged the authorities to implement the PFFR and sustain
efforts to strengthen balance sheets. Enhanced risk management along with stronger
profitability would make the banking system more efficient and robust. This would allow the
banks to better support medium-term growth, including by avoiding a reemergence of past
balance-sheet problems. Meanwhile, however, some balance-sheet weaknesses remain: NPLs
are high at regional banks, and DTAs are a significant part of regulatory capital. The mission
thus encouraged the authorities to continue with tightened regulation and supervision—
especially for regional banks. The authorities broadly shared this view, noting that a proposal
to phase in limits on DTAs in bank capital is under consideration. More generally, the
authorities’ aim is to pay continued attention to balance-sheet weaknesses, while increasing
emphasis on forward-looking issues under the PFFR. For the regional banks, in light of
factors including the more limited risk management capabilities of these banks, the
authorities will continue with the Action Program for Enhancement of Relationship Banking
plan, under which banks played a more active role in debt workouts with problem borrowers.
41.
It was agreed that the planned privatization of Japan Post could help level the
playing field for private financial institutions. Japan Post includes massive savings and

16

Financial sector reforms since the 1997–98 “big bang” have included the winding up of
registration requirements on foreign exchange transactions in 1998, pension reforms in 2000
and 2001, and opening up bank window sales channels for various investment products.
Following these measures, institutional investors have gradually shifted portfolios toward
foreign assets (see the Selected Issues paper chapter on home bias).

17

The Selected Issues paper analyzes factors affecting bank profitability in Japan.

- 25 -

Box 8. Is Japan’s Home Bias Disappearing?
Historically, Japanese investors have shown a strong preference for domestic assets—or
“home bias.” Reflected in a low ratio of holdings of foreign assets to total assets, home bias
is present in many countries. However, it has been particularly pronounced in Japan, due in
part to a combination of regulatory restrictions, administrative guidance, and aversion to
currency risk.
However, investment in foreign assets has picked up. In the past decade, Japan has
reduced or eliminated many administrative and regulatory sources of home bias. The
remaining structural impediments to acquiring foreign assets do not appear out of the norm
for an advanced country. Investors have responded to these changes, as well as low domestic
interest rates and relative yen stability, by increasing purchases of foreign portfolio assets.
Indeed, such purchases reached a record rate in 2003 and a near-record in 2004—almost
double the average pace of 2000–02—and continued at a strong pace in the first quarter of
2005. Correspondingly, the share of foreign assets in Japanese portfolios is rising.
This adjustment could have further to go. It takes time to build up new sales channels or
introduce new portfolio management practices. Accordingly, flows may respond fully to the
new regulatory environment only with a delay of a few years. If outward flows continue at
current rates, home bias should fall further, both in the aggregate and for several classes of
institutional investors (see the Selected Issues paper).

With other factors at play, the macroeconomic implications of a continued reduction in
home bias are not clear. Capital outflows associated with declining home bias would be
expected to put downward pressure on the exchange rate. However, there have been
countervailing trends on the financial account, including a surge in foreign purchases of
Japanese equities in 2003 and 2004. This may be due to reduced home bias on the part of
foreign investors, as documented in the April 2005 World Economic Outlook. Moreover, the
financial liberalization that contributed to the rise in Japanese appetite for foreign assets has
also helped to raise the attractiveness of Japanese assets to foreign investors.

insurance arms, with postal savings deposits of ¥214 trillion and life insurance policies in
force of ¥119 trillion (equivalent to almost one-half and one-fourth of GDP, respectively) in
FY2004. In addition to a huge balance sheet and explicit government guarantees, the
institution enjoys exemptions from deposit insurance premia and certain taxes. Bills
submitted to the Diet in early 2005 provide for Japan Post to be subdivided into four entities
(mail services, postal deposits, insurance, and over-the-counter services) and privatized over
2007–17 under a holding company structure. The holding company would be partly
government-owned after 2017 but the deposit-taking and insurance arms would be fully
divested. Some observers have expressed concerns about certain features in the draft bills—
notably the provision to allow the holding company to buy back shares in the savings and life
insurance arms after they were privatized—but by and large the draft legislation was viewed
as appropriate. The mission underscored the importance of taking timely steps ahead of full
privatization to ensure fair competition with private institutions, including by phasing out
exemptions from deposit insurance premia and taxes as stipulated in the draft bills. The
mission also saw merit in scaling back and consolidating the activities of other government
financial institutions, as is under consideration, which could both make room for private
lending and reduce fiscal risks.
Structural reforms: Boosting Japan’s medium-term prospects
42.
The government has been pursuing a range of structural reforms to lift
productivity. For example, conditions have been eased for the use of temporary workers and
job placement services; the penalties for anti-competitive behavior have been increased; and
regulations have been relaxed in a number of localities on a pilot basis, under the “Special
Zones for Structural Reform” initiative. Notwithstanding these steps, the authorities consider
that much remains to be done in a wide range of areas. A recent government-sponsored
report “Japan’s 21st Century Vision” appropriately highlights the importance of improving
productivity and reaping the benefits of globalization in order to avoid deteriorating living
standards.
43.
In spite of these efforts, unresolved structural rigidities continue to hamper
underlying growth. The efficient allocation of resources remains saddled by market
distortions, excessive and often unclear regulation, and a weak anti-trust framework. Against
this background, productivity growth has tended to decline over time.
44.
The mission supported the authorities’ aims to address these rigidities and
encouraged them to pursue a comprehensive agenda, including (see Annex IV for
details):
•

Further improving flexibility and participation in labor markets. Key measures would
include clarifying the conditions for dismissing workers, and implementing more
family-friendly policies to encourage women to enter (or reenter) the labor force.

•

Enhancing competition in product markets. The Fair Trade Commission could further
stiffen its financial penalties for anti-trust violations, which remain low by
international standards. Also, regulation could be relaxed further, for example by

- 27 -

allowing more private-sector involvement in health and education at a national level
(in line with “Special Zones” initiatives).
•

Encouraging inward foreign direct investment. A key measure is to allow share-forshare swaps, along the lines of recent revisions to the Commercial Code (their entry
into force has been delayed). These revisions, along with clearer rules regarding
takeover defenses, would also facilitate domestic corporate restructuring.

45.
The authorities agreed that reforms are needed on a broad front, and hoped that
barriers to more rapid progress would ease in coming years. In that connection, the 21st
Century Vision report has been helpful in highlighting the need for action. Nevertheless,
vested interests continue to oppose liberalization measures in a number of areas such as
medical care, and building a public consensus would take time. However, the authorities
intend to move steadily ahead with their reform agenda, continuing to develop and
implement structural measures with the aims to revitalize the economy and foster a larger
role for the private sector in economic activity.

The mission also highlighted the agricultural sector as particularly in need of

for most other sectors. Staff urged the authorities to reduce overall farm support and to better
target assistance, lowering import barriers

47.
Trade liberalization more generally would help spur productivity gains. The
mission urged Japan to play a leadership role in the Doha negotiations. In line with this
objective, the authorities support ambitious outcomes in areas such as textiles, clothing and

footwear, and forestry and fisheries, where Japan retains pockets of high protection. Their
interests in the Doha Round include trade facilitation, promoting South-South trade, reducing
industrial product tariffs (especially in advanced developing countries), and tightening WTO
rules on anti-dumping. This agenda could benefit Japan while strengthening the multilateral
system and providing security and new market access for developing countries. The
authorities reaffirmed that the multilateral system remains Japan’s top trade priority.
Although the rapidly expanding network of regional trade agreements diverts attention and
resources from this priority, officials do not see scope to slow negotiations on such
arrangements during the remainder of the Doha Round.19
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
48.
Continued progress has been made in resolving the legacies of the bubble years.
The financial system has been stabilized, the corporate sector is more resilient, and labor
markets have begun to revive. Moreover, a start has been made on fiscal consolidation, and
elements of a medium-term strategy to address fiscal imbalances are in place. As a result of
this progress, the economy appears to be better positioned to sustain an expansion than it has
been in a number of years.
49.
Nevertheless, further efforts are needed to deal with the risks to medium-term
prospects posed by low trend growth and mounting demographic pressures. Population
aging is pushing up social spending, a trend that will only worsen in time. In addition, as
illustrated by last year’s soft patch, modest underlying growth makes the outlook vulnerable
to shocks. In this situation, building on efforts so far with fiscal and structural reforms will
help to secure a robust medium-term expansion.
50.
The necessary fiscal and structural reforms will be difficult, but will pay
dividends for Japan and the world. Significant fiscal consolidation will not be easy, given
the sizeable cuts in discretionary spending already made. Moreover, structural reforms will
continue to face resistance from vested interests. Nevertheless, a push to accelerate fiscal and
structural adjustment would be timely in light of the growing public consensus in favor of
reform, which itself is due in part to the increasing evidence (notably in the financial system)
that past reforms are bearing fruit. Accelerated reforms would benefit not only Japan but the
world, both by raising global growth and—by bolstering domestic demand—helping to
resolve global imbalances.
51.
As for monetary policy, the priority remains conquering deflation. With
continued deflationary pressures and uncertainties about the outlook, the accommodative
19

A free trade agreement with Singapore took effect in 2002, and one with Mexico in April
2005. In addition, negotiations with most individual ASEAN countries are well advanced and
negotiations on a comprehensive agreement with ASEAN are under way. An agreement with
Korea may be reached as early as this year, while discussions with India, Chile, Australia,
and Switzerland are at early stages.

- 29 -

stance of policy is appropriate. In line with the BoJ’s commitment, quantitative easing should
be sustained until deflation—and deflation expectations—are eliminated. The current account
target could probably be reduced without tightening monetary conditions, in view of reduced
liquidity demand. Nevertheless, maintaining the present level is appropriate for the time
being, as it signals unambiguously the BoJ’s commitment to maintain easy monetary
conditions. Indeed, given the high costs if deflation worsened, it would be preferable to err
on the side of being accommodative.
52.
Clear communication has helped to guide market expectations, and will play a
crucial role as monetary operations and conditions normalize over time. Recent more
explicit communication with markets and more open discussion of policy options have paid
off in connection with the recent smooth introduction of a more flexible operational directive.
Going forward, further effective communication can pave the way for future reductions in the
quantitative target for current account balances and, over time, a shift back to using interest
rates as a policy tool. It will be important to take a flexible approach as the end of deflation
draws nearer, with close attention to financial market stability, the economic environment,
and the strength of the monetary transmission mechanism. In this connection, announcing an
inflation objective may not provide benefits at present, but it could be a useful element of a
post-deflation monetary framework.
53.
Fiscal policy faces daunting medium-term challenges. Achieving the authorities’
objective of primary balance excluding social security by early in the next decade would lead
to a large decline in the deficit and require a strong effort. However, a significant primary
surplus will be needed to stabilize the debt, given the likely future level of real interest rates.
The more ambitious adjustment required is achievable, with the economy now more resilient
thanks to progress in addressing structural weaknesses. That said, the authorities’ plan to
achieve medium-term consolidation should have due flexibility to adapt to economic circumstances. Measures would need to be taken to both curtail spending and raise revenues. On the
expenditure side, there is some scope to continue reducing public investment, and early steps
to deal with rising healthcare spending are needed. On the revenue side, there is room to
broaden the tax base, and plans to raise the consumption tax could be put in place soon.
54.
Further progress in dealing with fiscal imbalances is desirable in the near term.
Welcome consolidation was achieved in FY2004. The authorities are taking a range of
measures and further deficit reduction is likely in the coming fiscal years. However, for
FY2005 the structural deficit is estimated to decline only slightly. At a minimum, any
windfall revenues should be saved. In FY2006, policy should aim to reduce the primary
deficit excluding social security by ¾ percent of GDP or more. Such an adjustment should be
feasible on the basis of planned and prospective policy changes.
55.
As for the financial system, the emphasis of policies is appropriately changing
from stabilization to revitalization. The banks are healthier, and major banks’ balancesheet problems are largely resolved. The smooth transition to partial deposit insurance is
evidence of solid public confidence in banking system stability. Continued supervisory
scrutiny is needed, though, to address remaining balance-sheet weaknesses—particularly
NPLs at regional banks. Looking ahead, improving risk management and enhancing the

- 30 -

environment for bank profitability are key to ensuring more effective financial intermediation
and avoiding the reemergence of balance-sheet problems. In this connection, the steps
envisioned in the PFFR, as well as privatization of Japan Post, are appropriate. Formulation
and implementation of measures—in the case of Japan Post, particularly those to level the
playing field with private institutions—should proceed without delay.
56.
More broadly, structural reforms to liberalize factor and product markets can
improve underlying growth. Increased labor force participation can help to offset the
impact of a declining working-age population. Deregulation, particularly to allow the private
sector a larger role in areas traditionally dominated by the government, can also help to boost
long-run growth. The agricultural sector can particularly benefit from reform, given the high
protection and low efficiency. Reducing import barriers and moving toward direct payments
to farmers would bolster productivity and enhance growth prospects.
57.
Further trade liberalization would be beneficial for both Japan and developing
countries. The authorities’ continued support for the multilateral trading system is welcome.
Indeed, Japan should play a leadership role in helping to bring about a successful conclusion
to the Doha negotiations. Concentrating on multilateral liberalization, with ambitious
measures regarding agricultural imports, would enhance opportunities for developing
countries and yield sizeable benefits for Japanese consumers.
58.
Japan has made commendable efforts to maintain ODA notwithstanding
budgetary pressures. Going forward, the authorities are encouraged to do their utmost to
raise development assistance toward the UN recommended target.
59.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the
12-month cycle.

Japan maintains a floating exchange rate regime. The exchange system is free of restrictions
on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions, with the
exceptions of restrictions maintained against the Taliban, Al-Qaeda, the former Iraqi regime,
and others, pursuant to UN Security Council Resolutions 1267, 1333, 1390, 1373, 1483, and
1532. These restrictions were notified to the Fund (EBD/02/52 and EBD/04/111) in
accordance with Executive Board Decision No. 144–(52/51).
VIII.

Article IV Consultation:

The 2004 Article IV consultation discussions were held during May 7–20 2004; the
Executive Board discussed the Staff Report (IMF Country Report No. 04/224) and concluded
the consultation on July 28, 2004. Executive Directors welcomed signs that the Japanese
economy is emerging from its long period of slump, with support from a range of policy
measures. At the same time, Directors noted that financial and corporate sector weaknesses
remain, mild deflation persists, and the public debt is very high, which could restrain growth
over the medium term. Against this background, Directors considered that policies should
build on the existing reform program in order to resolve remaining weaknesses promptly,
boost Japan’s economic potential, and thereby sustain expansion over the longer term. The
staff report, staff supplement, selected issues paper, and PIN were all published.

ANNEX II

JAPAN—STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Japan subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) on July 3, 1996
and met the SDDS specifications for the coverage, periodicity, and timeliness of data and for
dissemination of advance release calendars on June 9, 2000. Economic and financial data
provided to the Fund are considered adequate for surveillance purposes. The Japanese
authorities have agreed to participate in the data module for a Report on the Observance of
Standards and Codes (data ROSC) scheduled to take place in September 12–28, 2005. This
will involve detailed assessments of their country’s practices with regard to the following
data headings.
2.

National accounts

•

The Japanese National Accounts were revised in 2000 by the Economic and Social
Research Institute (ESRI) to reflect the 1993 System of National Accounts (1993
SNA). The data revision involved, among other things, the inclusion of spending on
computer software in investment expenditure and depreciation on social capital in
government consumption, and revision of the benchmark year to 1995. Improved
seasonal adjustment methods were also introduced to take account of leap year and
other shift factors. The data revisions, from 1980 onwards, are described in ESRI’s
publication System of National Accounts 1993 in Japan (April 2001).

•

Preliminary estimates of Japan’s quarterly GDP data are released by the ESRI.
Starting with data from the second quarter of 2002, it introduced a new method that
combines supply and demand side indicators to improve the accuracy of the
estimates. In particular, additional supply side indicators are combined with the
previously-used demand side indicators, thereby reducing the statistical discrepancy
between estimates of GDP measured from the production and expenditure sides.
ESRI also now releases the estimate about 1½ months after the end of the quarter,
approximately a month earlier than before. At the same time, more frequent backward
revisions and concurrent seasonal adjustment methods were introduced. More
complete annual national accounts data are only available with a lag of nine months
to one year.1

•

The industrial production series was improved in April 2003. The base year was
updated from 1995 to 2000, with corresponding updates to components weights, and
seasonal adjustment factors. One effect of these revisions is to increase the weight on
the electrical machinery sector. In addition, revised seasonal adjustments may smooth
the recent history of the series.

1

The data are available in electronic format and hard copy after nine months and one year,
respectively.

- - 43

ANNEX II

•

In November 2002, methods for estimating pension fund output were improved, and
part of expenditure on mobile telecommunication devices was reclassified to
consumption because of wider dissemination of mobile phones to the public. These
and other less significant changes were incorporated in National Accounts data back
to 1990.

•

The Family Income and Expenditure Survey (FIES) has been subject to volatility,
particularly in “lumpy” expenditure items such as consumer durables. Some steps
were taken in January 2002 to improve the quality of the data, including a modest
expansion of the sample size to about 9,000 households and reclassification of survey
items to better reflect expenditures on IT products. In addition, a new survey on
durable goods expenditures, covering about 30,000 households, was introduced in
October 2001, and has been incorporated in GDP estimates since December 2004.

•

The GDP data on some key components of demand are available only with the release
of the annual data, including the breakdown of trade flows into goods and services, of
business investment into structures and equipment, and of private consumption into
durables and nondurables.

•

Preliminary estimates for the income side of the national accounts (with the exception
of household employment income (or compensation of employees)) are not provided,
in part because estimates for profits are based on an imputed quarterly pattern for
annual data.

•

A chain-linked price index number formula (following 1993 SNA recommendations)
was adopted for use in the estimation of real GDP, beginning with the third quarter of
2004.

The ESRI relies on other agencies and organizations to compile the underlying source data
used to construct the national accounts, and faces coordination problems with data providers
in influencing the design of surveys and administrative collections to serve national accounts
purposes.
The Statistics Bureau is responsible for the compilation of the consumer price index (CPI)
and the Bank of Japan (BoJ) is responsible for the wholesale price index (WPI). The WPI has
been renamed as the corporate goods price index (CGPI) to better reflect its characteristics.
•

The CPI has its weights updated every five years. However, the Statistical Bureau
also compiles a chained CPI with weights updated every year and a “mid-period”
index. The latter index has been shown to provide a good approximation to a
“superlative” index which makes use of current and base period weights and is
theoretically desirable. Estimates for 1995 to 2000 found the chained estimates to be
lower than the fixed base “official” index and the “mid-period” index to be in turn
lower than the chained index, though the differences were not substantial.

- - 44

•

ANNEX II

The Bank of Japan (BoJ) revised its CGPI by updating the base year from 1995 to
2000, updating commodities that constitute the index and increasing the number of
sample prices for the index compilation. The BoJ produces both chained and fixed
base estimates. For February 1995, for example, for all commodities, the former fell
to 94.4 (2000=100) while the latter was 96.5 (BoJ website).

The compilation of chained indexes accords with recommendations in the 2004 CPI and PPI
Manuals.
3.

Fiscal

•

Fiscal accounts distinguish between general (or ordinary) accounts for core
government functions, and special accounts, some of which are partly financed
through borrowing from the Fiscal Investment and Loan Program (FILP). Information
on the central government general account is readily available, but published
consolidated accounts—which incorporate special accounts—are insufficient to
calculate a consolidated deficit.

•

There exist more than 2,000 independent prefectures and municipalities, the finances
of which are only partly consolidated with a delay of about one year. The most recent
data for local public finances are published with a lag of six months and final data
with a lag of nine months.

•

Data on general government operations—including disaggregation by major
government sector—are available with the release of the annual national accounts
data.

•

The government has published its annual balance sheet since October 2000. Estimates
from FY1998 to FY2002 are now available. However, the relationship with the flow
data is unclear because the balance sheet consolidates the FILP whereas flow data do
not.

•

The authorities have not reported fiscal data for publication in the GFS Yearbook
since 1994 and STA attempts to initiate reporting have been unsuccessful. As a result,
the Japan country page has been dropped from the GFS Yearbook. No fiscal data are
reported for publication in IFS.

4.

External sector

•

Monthly data on merchandise trade and the balance of payments are released on a
timely basis.

5.

Monetary and financial sector

•

There are some weaknesses in the monetary and financial data submitted to STA. For
example, other (private) nonfinancial corporations, other (nonbank) financial

- - 45

ANNEX II

corporations, and individuals and households are all aggregated as a single category
(private sector). Timeliness of data could also be improved. Depository corporations
(DC) data are disseminated six to eight business days after the end of the reference
month for money stocks and total credit. However, DC data on the external position,
as well as the breakdown of credit to the government and to the private sector, are
usually disseminated six to ten weeks after the end of the reference month. Only data
on money stocks and total credit meet the one-month SDDS timeliness requirement
for Analytical Accounts of the Banking sector.
6.

Recommendations for data improvements

In the short term, there is a need to:
•

improve the timeliness and periodicity of the fiscal data (particularly given the
importance of monitoring fiscal consolidation efforts on a comprehensive basis); and

•

provide greater detail on the quarterly components of spending and national income.

Over the longer term, efforts should be directed to:
•

moving data production (other than monetary and financial statistics) to a single,
independent agency.

ANNEX III

JAPAN—PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
1.
The staff has updated its assessment of Japan’s medium-term debt sustainability, on the basis of the government’s announced fiscal goals. (The macroeconomic
assumptions are based on the latest WEO submission.) The central goal of the authorities’
plan is the achievement of a primary surplus (excluding social security) by the early 2010s,
compared with a deficit estimated at 4.2 percent in FY2004. The baseline scenario assumes
that fiscal consolidation is achieved through both revenue measures and expenditure
reductions (the specific reforms underlying the government’s plan have not yet been
identified). Projections for social security incorporate reforms introduced in 2004 which are
expected to slow the growth in pension spending. Nonetheless, the social security system will
continue to run a deficit (estimated at 1.9 percent of GDP by FY2013).
2.
Under this scenario, public debt will continue to grow rapidly. By 2010, net debt
will rise to almost 110 percent of GDP, up from 82 percent at end-2004. Debt would
accumulate even more rapidly in the

JAPAN—PRIORITIES FOR STRUCTURAL REFORM

1.
Unresolved structural rigidities explain much of Japan’s low potential growth.

adjustment to the excesses of the

construction, food processing,
agriculture, transportation, and communication has lagged that in countries where
competitive forces have been less fettered. Impeded factor mobility across sectors and
enterprises has weighed on average productivity in manufacturing as well.
2.
Estimates of the gains from removing structural impediments vary, but benefits
are likely to be substantial. Static gains (basically, one-time increases in productivity
arising from a more efficient use of resources) are thought to range from about 2 percent of
GDP (for trade reform) to about 8 percent of GDP (in the case of broad-based deregulation).
Dynamic gains in the form of permanent increases in multifactor productivity growth are
estimated in the range 0.3 to 2.4 percent of GDP depending on the breadth of reforms.
Broadly, these estimates support the view that further structural reforms are key to raise the
long-term growth potential.1
3.

A comprehensive reform agenda would entail the following priorities:2
a. Labor markets. Greater flexibility in the labor market has facilitated corporate
restructuring, but there remain obstacles to labor mobility. Furthermore, the
market has become more dualistic, with a growing divide between “regular

workers” and those on temporary or part-time contracts—who earn lower wages,
are less able to upgrade their human capital, and largely fall through the social
safety net. An additional issue for Japan is to support labor supply in the face of
adverse demographic trends. In order to address these issues, essential steps
include:
i. Reducing employment protection for regular workers while
shoring up the social insurance coverage for temporary workers.
This will address both equity and efficiency concerns, rebalancing the
mix of regular and temporary workers at the margin. (Recent employment growth has largely been driven by temporary hires.)
ii. Making corporate pensions portable to enhance labor mobility.
iii. Boosting the role of private job placement services.
iv. Encouraging labor force participation through family-friendly
policies to invite working age women to re-enter the labor force and
discourage early retirement of all workers.
b. Product markets. Competitive forces are weak in many domestic markets
because of timid enforcement of competition laws as well as low import
penetration. Markups are high by international standards in the service sector
and Japan’s price level remains well above that in countries with a similar
level of per capita income. Measures to address these problems include:
i. A more vigorous enforcement of competition law through stronger
powers for the Fair Trade Commission and more effective sanctions.
A new anti-monopoly law that goes some way in this direction was
adopted in April 2005 and will take effect in January 2006.
ii. A review of regulatory policies and procedures in many sectors.
Large-store regulations laws (which favor small-scale outlets) should
be further relaxed to enhance the retail sector’s productivity.
Independent sector regulators should be established to regulate
network industries and limit the risk of regulatory capture. Universal
service obligations should be subject to cost-benefit analysis—and
financed by fiscal transfers. In the postal sector, these universal
service obligations should be abolished for new entrants. There is
scope for regulatory reform in the energy sector (electricity, gas) and
in the telecommunication sector that would bring prices down to international levels. (For example, Japan is one of the largest consumer of
natural gas. Liberalization of the sector could give important gains
both for consumers and manufacture producers.) As for the
transportation sector, according to the OECD, the cost of using
Japan’s harbors and airports is high by international standards.

- 52 -

ANNEX IV

c. Inward FDI. Japan’s has the lowest inward FDI position as a ratio of GDP
among OECD countries (about 2 percent versus more than 10 percent in the
majority of OECD countries). This reflects the long period of economic
stagnation but also barriers to entry for foreign firms. These barriers include
limits on the use of foreign shares to acquire Japanese companies (which are
scheduled to be removed) and relatively high effective taxation on inward
FDI. Key steps to stimulate FDI inflows should include:
i. A shift to product market regulation that strengthens competition.
ii. A removal of remaining barriers and implicit restrictions on
inward FDI, to increase foreign rivalry and the contestability of
domestic markets.
d. Agriculture. Both domestic and trade policies maintain a high level of
protection of this sector, evidenced inter alia by the very high prices of food
and low sectoral productivity. The agenda for agricultural reform is
intrinsically linked to an overhaul of commercial policies for the sector.
Needed steps are:
i. Promote competition and large-scale operations by allowing entry
of corporations in the sector nation-wide (now it is possible only in a
few agricultural “special zones.”)
ii. Reduce agricultural protection. Japan’s trade policies for agriculture
pursue goals that are very different from those for the manufacturing
sector (which is generally more open than in the EU and the U.S.).
There is a consistently high tariff wall: according to the WTO, the
average unweighted tariff is about 16 percent but tariff dispersion is
large. In 2001, overall support to producers (as reported by the OECD)
accounted for about 1 percent of GDP or nearly 60 percent of
agricultural value-added (compared to about 30 percent in the EU and
20 percent in the U.S.). The authorities accept in principle the need for
changes in farm policies, but progress has been slow.

Staff Report for the 2005 Article IV Consultation
Supplementary Information
Prepared by the Asia and Pacific Department
(In consultation with other departments)
Approved by Daniel Citrin and Michael T. Hadjimichael
July 26, 2005

1.
This supplement provides an update of economic developments since the release
of the staff report. The thrust of the staff appraisal remains unchanged.
2.
Data released over the last three weeks point to continued growth and
strengthening domestic demand. The June Tankan survey reports both improved business
conditions during the second quarter and upgraded investment plans at both manufacturing
and nonmanufacturing firms. Indicators of private consumption also remain on an upward
trend, partly reflecting continued improvements in labor markets. Export growth, however,
continues to be weak, partly as a result of reduced demand in the region, although exports to
China picked up in June. Production-side data confirm improved prospects, although
inventory decumulation in the IT sector and weak foreign machinery orders are holding back
industrial activity. Consumer prices (excluding perishables), which have been declining
slightly year-on-year, were unchanged in May, reflecting a rise in gasoline prices.
3.
Against this background, the authorities remain of the view that the expansion is
on track. In its latest monthly bulletin, the Bank of Japan notes that the economy continues
to recover, notwithstanding ongoing adjustments in IT-related sectors, and the trend is
expected to be maintained. The Cabinet Office reaches a similar assessment in its July report.
The staff will review its growth projections following the release of second quarter GDP data
in August. At this stage, recent data and the shift in the pattern of growth suggest that the
near-term projections for the current account surplus in the staff report may be marked down.
4.
The authorities welcomed the revaluation of the Chinese renminbi, noting that a
flexible Chinese currency would benefit not only China, but also Japan and the global
economy. The yen appreciated by over 1 percent against the dollar on the news, reversing
part of its recent decline. The staff considers that, on balance, the impact of the revaluation
on Japan’s economy will be modest.

-2-

5.
In late June, two government advisory bodies released recommendations on
economic reform. The Tax Commission proposed revisions to income taxation, including
streamlined deductions, a less generous treatment of retirement income, and an overhaul of
income tax brackets. The Council on Economic and Fiscal Policy presented to the prime
minister broad policy guidelines to inform the budget discussions for FY 2006. The
guidelines call inter alia for capping some medical expenditures, rationalizing public work
spending, reducing the number of public servants, and studying ways to liberalize the
immigration of unskilled workers. These proposals will be developed in more detail in the
months ahead.
6.
The lower house of the Diet approved the government’s plan to privatize Japan
Post by a very narrow majority. The draft bill is now under consideration by the upper
house which is expected to vote on it by mid-August. Much rides on this decision, as the
prime minister could dissolve the lower house and call for early elections if the legislation,
which he strongly supports, fails to be adopted.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation with Japan
On July 29, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Japan.1
Background
GDP growth slowed unexpectedly in the second quarter of 2004, after several quarters of above
trend growth. For the full year, GDP rose by 2.6 percent, well below expectations. A significant
part of the shortfall reflected a shift to a chain-weighted methodology—growth on the old
methodology was 3.6 percent. The rest was associated with an unanticipated fall in partner
country demand, owing to a slowdown in the global IT market as well as higher oil prices, and
weaker private domestic demand. During 2005, economic activity has rebounded, with
unexpectedly strong GDP growth in the first quarter (4.9 percent SAAR), partly reflecting
temporary factors. Recent indicators, notably on retail sales, investment plans, and employment
growth portend a continued expansion going forward. Despite the acceleration in activity, mild
underlying deflation persists. Financial markets developments have been uneventful, with the
Nikkei broadly flat and bond yields somewhat lower compared with a year ago.
The yen has been broadly stable against the U.S. dollar and on a multilateral basis. Over
the past 12 months, the bilateral exchange rate vis-à-vis the dollar has been in a range of
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2¥102 to ¥115. Appreciation pressures emerged toward the end of 2004, driven largely by broadbased dollar weakness, but receded on expectations of faster tightening by the U.S. Federal
Reserve. In effective terms, the nominal and real exchange rates have been little changed over
the past 12 months. Unit labor costs have been declining, while growing in partner countries;
and, given Japan’s already sizeable external surplus, competitiveness is not a concern at
present.
Pressure on labor markets from job shedding is slowly abating. The unemployment rate is at a
six-year low, the ratio of job offers to applicants has continued to hover at post-bubble highs,
and corporate surveys indicate declining labor market slack. Employment of regular workers is
firming, as the past trend toward hiring temporary and contract workers begins to ebb. Thanks
in part to the shift back towards regular workers (who are more highly paid), real wages have
recently bottomed out, with positive implications for future income growth.
Progress in corporate restructuring continues. Cash flow and profits remain buoyant,
bankruptcies have fallen to a ten-year low, and leverage continues to decline. Furthermore, the
recovery in the corporate sector continues to broaden beyond large export-oriented
manufacturers to include smaller enterprises and nonmanufacturers.
Further progress has also been made in strengthening the banking system. Tightened
regulation of major banks under the Program for Financial Revival (PFR), together with
corporate sector improvements, have reduced nonperforming loans (NPLs) and supported
ratings upgrades. Major banks more than met the PFR’s goal of halving the NPL ratio to around
4 percent by the program’s expiration in March 2005. The pace of decline in bank lending has
slowed, and according to the Tankan survey, borrowers perceive an increased willingness to
lend. In addition, a blanket guarantee on bank deposits was lifted at end-March, with no signs of
strain. Nonetheless, the process of revitalizing the banking system has further to go, with the
quality of bank capital weakened by deferred tax assets, core profitability still low, and regional
banks lagging in cutting bad loans.
Monetary policy remains highly accommodative, with liquidity ample and short-term interest
rates at zero under the quantitative easing framework. The Bank of Japan has repeatedly
stressed that the policy will remain in place until deflation is defeated. In May, it decided to allow
temporary undershooting of its target range for current account balances at the Bank in light of
seasonal volatility in liquidity demand. The move was generally perceived by markets as a
technical step and not as a fundamental policy shift.
Fiscal consolidation was achieved in FY2004 (ending March 2005), but the deficit remains
large. The general government deficit is estimated to have narrowed by 0.6 percent of GDP to
6.9 percent of GDP. The structural balance improved by 0.3 percent of GDP. About half of the
decline in the general government deficit reflected stronger-than-expected revenues and some
expenditure savings achieved in the supplementary budget. A decade of high deficits has fed
rapid growth in gross public debt to 170 percent of GDP, by far the highest among advanced
countries. Net debt is around 80 percent of GDP.
The near-term macroeconomic outlook is improving. The slowdown in world growth appears to
have bottomed out, with strong first quarter growth in most regions, while inventory and

-3production adjustments in the IT sector are advancing and other data point to a revival of private
consumption and investment. Accordingly, annual average growth of Japan’s GDP is projected
at about 1¾ percent in 2005 and 2006. As economic slack is taken up, deflationary pressures
should ease, with consumer prices finally bottoming out in 2006. Risks remain biased to the
downside, and include weakening global growth (especially if new spikes in oil prices occur),
and renewed upward pressure on the yen. For the medium term, growth is anticipated to slow to
potential, estimated at 1.5 percent. Relatively low potential growth reflects muted total factor
productivity, as well as a continued decline in the working-age population.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the further signs of progress in resolving the legacies of the
bubble years in Japan. The financial system has been stabilized, the corporate sector is more
resilient, labor markets have become more dynamic, and fiscal consolidation is under way. As a
result, the economy appears better positioned to sustain an expansion.
Nonetheless, Directors noted that low trend growth and rising demographic pressures pose
risks to medium-term prospects. Population aging is pushing up social spending, and modest
underlying growth leaves the economy susceptible to shocks. Against this background, further
efforts will be needed to advance fiscal and structural reforms in order to strengthen the
underpinnings for more robust self-sustained growth. Directors acknowledged that implementing
such reforms will be difficult, but emphasized that they would strengthen the domestic economy
and, together with concerted policy efforts in other countries to address external imbalances,
contribute to making the global economy more resilient, thereby limiting the risk of a disorderly
adjustment in currency markets.
Directors agreed that the priority for monetary policy remains to eliminate deflation.
They welcomed the Bank of Japan’s commitment to maintain an accommodative stance until
both actual and expected inflation turn positive. Most Directors were of the view that, in the face
of reduced liquidity demand, the target for current account balances could probably be reduced
without tightening monetary conditions. Nonetheless, Directors agreed with the Bank of Japan
that, in order to signal unambiguously the commitment to maintaining an easy monetary stance,
keeping the target at its present level for the time being was appropriate.
Directors emphasized that continued clear communication of the authorities’ monetary policy
intentions will play a crucial role in promoting policy credibility and effectiveness as deflation
ebbs and monetary operations shift back to using interest rates as a policy tool. Directors
generally supported the Bank of Japan’s preference for adopting a flexible approach in shifting
to a new monetary policy framework, tailored to evolving financial and economic conditions.
Some Directors supported the announcement of a quantified inflation objective to stabilize
inflation expectations once deflation is incontestably defeated. Others noted that, in the current
situation, the benefits of announcing an inflation target might be limited, in light of the
uncertainties about the effectiveness of the monetary policy transmission mechanism.
Directors observed that the authorities base their exchange rate policy on the conviction that
exchange rates should reflect economic fundamentals and that disorderly movements are not
desirable for economic growth. They noted that the authorities had not intervened in the foreign

-4exchange markets since early 2004. At the same time, given the primacy of protecting the
objectives of eradicating deflation and supporting growth, a few Directors considered that
intervention could be warranted as a last resort if appreciation pressures seriously threaten to
lower the price level or risk the economic recovery, and taking into account the limited scope for
more conventional monetary and fiscal policy. Most other Directors, however, pointed to the
economy’s improved ability to handle a stronger currency, and cautioned that intervention
should only be used under extraordinary circumstances.
Directors welcomed the progress made in advancing fiscal consolidation in FY2004, but noted
that the deficit remains large, the public debt is set to rise further, and the structural balance will
decline only a little in the current fiscal year, despite steps to restrain nondiscretionary spending
and raise revenues. They encouraged the authorities to save any potential tax windfall and to
avoid any expansionary measures in this year’s supplementary budget, assuming the
expansion continues as envisaged.
Directors considered that stabilizing the public debt and making room for the fiscal costs of
population aging will present challenges to fiscal policy in the medium term. They welcomed the
authorities’ objective of achieving primary balance excluding social security by early in the next
decade. A number of Directors agreed that a steady and gradual reduction in the deficit is
appropriate, to minimize any negative impact on the still-nascent economic recovery. Many
other Directors, however, observed that a larger adjustment may be required to stabilize the
debt, especially if real interest rates rise more than expected in the future. While such an
adjustment would require difficult measures on both the revenue and expenditure sides, the
adjustment should be manageable in light of the economy’s improved resilience. Directors saw
scope for further streamlining public investment and for civil service reform, as well as for
comprehensive tax reforms, including an increase in the consumption tax. At the same time,
they recommended that fiscal adjustment plans be given flexibility to adapt to changing
economic circumstances.
Directors welcomed the progress made in resolving balance sheet problems in the banking
system. They saw the smooth transition to partial deposit insurance as an important sign of
public confidence in banking system stability. Looking ahead, Directors noted that the emphasis
of financial sector policies is appropriately shifting toward revitalization, as highlighted in the
new Program for Further Financial Reform. They welcomed the goals of the new program, and
looked forward to prompt implementation of specific measures. The priorities include continued
supervisory scrutiny to address remaining balance sheet weaknesses, particularly among the
regional banks, and steps to improve risk management and enhance the environment for bank
profitability. Directors also welcomed the planned privatization of Japan Post, the country’s
largest deposit-taker, which could help level the playing field for private financial institutions.
Directors stressed that structural reforms will be needed to mitigate the effects of population
aging on potential growth and bolster Japan’s productive capacity. Liberalizing factor and
product markets will help strengthen underlying growth prospects, and in that vein, labor market
flexibility should be increased further, product market competition enhanced, and inward foreign
direct investment encouraged. Directors noted that reform of the agricultural sector could yield
large benefits, given the sector’s high protection and low efficiency. They encouraged the
authorities to reduce import barriers and move toward direct payments to farmers.

-5Directors called on the authorities to make further trade liberalization a central element of their
structural reform agenda, to the benefit of both Japan and developing countries. They
welcomed Japan’s continued support for the multilateral trading system, and encouraged the
authorities to take a leadership role in helping to bring about a successful conclusion of the
Doha Round negotiations.
Directors commended Japan’s efforts to maintain official development assistance
notwithstanding budget pressures. They encouraged the authorities to raise development
assistance toward the UN recommended target.
