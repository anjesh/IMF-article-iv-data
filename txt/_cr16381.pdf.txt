IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with Switzerland

On November 21, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation1 with Switzerland.
The economy withstood relatively well the sharp appreciation that followed the exit from the
exchange rate floor. Economic performance has continued to firm in 2016 with support from
domestic and external demand. GDP growth is forecast to reach 1.5 percent in 2016, and to
stabilize at 1.7 percent over the medium term. Inflation is expected to return to positive territory
in 2017 and to continue to rise to the middle of the target band. However, important external and
domestic risks could affect this outlook, including a resurgence in global financial market
volatility, renewed concerns about the financial health of large global banks, sharp swings in
domestic property prices and changes in Swiss-EU economic relations.
Policies adopted in recent years have aided the recovery and mitigated risks. The two-pronged
approach to monetary policy—combining a negative interest rate with foreign currency
purchases—together with support from fiscal policy helped to avert sustained deflation, a
prolonged slowdown of the economy and an increase in unemployment following the exit from
the exchange rate floor. A series of macroprudential measures stabilized house prices following
an extended period of continuous increases, although prices remain high relative to household
income and exposure to mortgage debt is elevated. The recently introduced stricter capital
standards for the Swiss global banks (G-SIBs)—to be fully adopted by 2019—are intended to
further boost their financial strength and insulate the domestic economy from financial
contagion.
The Swiss economy continues to face important challenges. Weaker external demand and the
possibility of further large capital inflows may warrant additional policy support and some
rebalancing of policies. The global low interest rate environment could rekindle house prices and
financial stability risks. Population aging and slower immigration will create funding gaps in the

public pension system, while minimum mandated interest rates for private pensions that exceed
market rates could affect long-run viability. Corporate tax reform is expected to trim future fiscal
revenue. Productivity enhancements would increase flexibility to absorb shocks and help
preserve the high standard of living.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed the resilience of the Swiss economy to the appreciation that
followed the exit from the exchange rate floor, and commended the authorities’ policy response,
which shielded the economy and set the conditions for a rapid recovery. Medium-term growth
prospects have also improved owing to the gradual unwinding of the real appreciation. Directors,
however, noted that a resurgence of capital inflows, sharp swings in domestic property prices,
concerns over large global banks, or changes to Swiss-EU economic relations could pose
challenges. They agreed that continued skillful policy management will be important going
forward.
Directors considered the Swiss National Bank’s two-pronged monetary policy, which combines a
negative interest rate and foreign exchange purchases, effective at averting a prolonged
slowdown and sustained deflation. They noted that the Swiss franc’s status as a safe haven
currency could shape the policy response, and that sharp appreciations were recently avoided
despite episodes of capital inflow surges. While over the longer term Directors saw scope for
additional upward flexibility of the franc, most Directors recommended that consideration be
given to a modest widening of the negative interest rate differential to deal with sustained inflow
pressures in the context of an overvalued exchange rate, thereby reducing the need for frequent
small foreign currency purchases and slowing the growth of the Swiss National Bank’s already
large balance sheet. A few Directors, however, expressed concern that monetary policy is being
overburdened and any further real depreciation would increase the current account surplus.
Directors welcomed the counter cyclical stabilization and scope for extraordinary support
provided under the fiscal debt brake rule, and observed that public debt had declined to moderate
levels. Given the available fiscal space and constraints on monetary policy, Directors saw scope
for additional fiscal support, including by fully utilizing the room available under the existing
debt brake framework. A few Directors, however, did not see the need at this point to adapt fiscal
policy to allow for higher spending or as suitable to address an overvalued currency.
Directors commended the earlier tightening of macroprudential policies that contributed to the
recent stabilization of house prices. They noted however, the elevated exposure to real estate by
borrowers and lenders, and the risk that competition among lenders could drive down interest

rates, triggering a renewed upswing in the mortgage credit house price cycle. Timely preparation
of new property related measures and strengthened supervision is therefore appropriate.
Directors considered the recently introduced too-big-to-fail regulations for large Swiss cross
border banks as appropriately more stringent than the Basel minimum requirements, reflecting
these banks’ large size relative to the Swiss economy and their systemic risk profile. More
generally, they agreed that review of risk weights that banks use in their internal ratings based
models is warranted and greater public disclosure of these weights should be considered, in line
with the forthcoming revisions to Basel requirements, to strengthen the credibility of banks’
financial reporting.
Directors recommended continued structural reforms to support medium term growth and reduce
risks. Early adjustment of pension system parameters would help ensure the long-term viability
of the social safety net. Continuing to meet international standards, particularly the AML/CFT
and tax transparency standards, is essential to preserve Switzerland as a prime destination for
foreign investment and protect the integrity of its banks. Directors highlighted that strengthening
productivity would help insulate the economy from future exchange rate shocks and a possible
slowing in the growth of the labor force, while the corporate income tax reform could boost
investment by small and medium-sized firms. Continuing to welcome foreign workers and
maintaining close economic ties with the EU would help safeguard Switzerland’s high standard
of living.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
November 4, 2016

KEY ISSUES
Context. The economy has adapted well to the appreciation that followed the exit from
the exchange floor. Growth is expected to reach 1½ percent this year and to stabilize at
around 1¾ percent over the medium term. A resurgence of capital inflows, a sharp
adjustment in property prices, renewed concerns over large global banks and changes to
Swiss-EU relations pose risks to this outlook. The two-pronged approach to monetary
policy helped avert a prolonged slowdown and sustained deflation by limiting further
appreciation, with some support from fiscal policy. Elevated exposure to mortgage debt
continues, and low interest rates could rekindle a credit-driven upswing in house prices.
Population aging and slower immigration will create funding gaps in the public pension
system, while minimum mandated interest rates for private pensions that exceed market
rates could affect viability. The Swiss systemically-important global banks are continuing
to build their financial strength. Corporate tax reform is expected to trim future tax
revenue.
Key policy recommendations. Macroeconomic policies should remain supportive, with
some fine tuning of policy tools. In the financial sector, preserving stability in the current
low interest rate setting and adapting to the evolving regulatory landscape are priorities.
Structural reforms are needed to build resilience to exchange rate and other shocks:
•

in the event of sustained inflow pressures, widen modestly the negative interest rate
differential against major central banks to allow foreign currency purchases to be
utilized mainly for capital inflow surges;

•

utilize fully the room available under the existing fiscal debt brake framework;

•

adjust pension system parameters to protect the viability of the social safety net;

•

stand ready to adopt new macroprudential measures if credit and house prices again
turn up, with a focus on the build-to-let segment;

•

continue to encourage the large Swiss cross-border banks to implement new
too-big-to-fail regulations, strengthen buffers for D-SIBs, ensure banks’ risk weights
adequately reflect risk and encourage greater disclosure of weights; and

•

fully comply with international standards and agreements and strengthen
productivity to ensure Switzerland remains a prime investment destination that is
open to foreign workers and has the resilience to absorb exchange rate and other
shocks.

CONTEXT
1.
The Swiss economy has performed solidly during 2010–15. GDP growth averaged
1¾ percent, the unemployment rate has been broadly steady around 3 percent, and the external
sector performed well, with the current account surplus averaging 11 percent of GDP. In addition,
real incomes had been boosted by sustained decreases in prices of imported products. More
generally, growth has been in line with the average for advanced economies, supported by a
favorable business environment (for 2016, the World Economic Forum again ranked Switzerland the
globally most competitive country).
2.
This solid performance occurred despite challenges stemming from Switzerland’s
status as a safe haven. Global risk-off episodes (most recently following the Brexit vote) and
monetary policy easing by the major central banks have triggered intermittent capital inflow surges
into Switzerland. As a result, the nominal and real effective exchange rates (NEER and REER)
appreciated by 40 percent and 24 percent, respectively, since 2008, leading the authorities to
introduce and subsequently remove an exchange rate floor against the euro.
3.
Switzerland’s direct democracy and close EU relations have contributed to political
stability and widespread support for domestic policies. With Switzerland located in the center of
Europe, the EU is a key partner, and their economies, labor markets and policies are closely linked.
Notwithstanding this close relationship, the Swiss population adopted a popular initiative in
February 2014 to limit mass immigration (Box 1). A solution agreeable to both the Swiss and the EU
is being sought.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
4.
The economy weathered relatively well the sharp appreciation that followed the exit
from the exchange rate floor. Activity was dented in early 2015 by the abrupt strengthening of the
franc. However, growth subsequently returned, aided by the flexibility of firms and the labor market,
to reach 0.8 percent for the year, although this was less than half the pace of 2014. Unemployment
edged up to 3.3 percent and the output gap widened to 0.8 percent of potential GDP by the end of
the year. The external sector held up well despite the currency shock, aided by some redirection of
exports from the euro area (where competitiveness had been eroded) toward countries with
currencies linked to the dollar (where Swiss products had gained competitiveness), although profit
margins at some companies were sharply squeezed. The drop in the price level helped to cushion
domestic spending.
5.
The appreciation in early 2015 led to a discernible fall in inflation, but the impact on
the current account was muted:


4

After remaining flat the previous year, consumer prices fell by 1.1 percent in year-average terms
(1.3 percent on a year-on-year basis) in 2015. Prices of domestic products dipped only

SWITZERLAND

marginally (consistent with the limited widening of the output gap), but import prices fell
sharply, reflecting the appreciation of the franc and the drop in world energy prices.


The current account surplus widened by 2½ percentage points to reach 11.3 percent of GDP in
2015. The increase reflects mainly the improved terms of trade from lower oil prices, the
resilience of exports in key sectors and a larger income balance owing to a wider interest rate
differential between foreign and domestic financial assets.

6.
Economic performance has continued to firm during 2016. Both domestic and external
demand have supported the pickup in growth. Deflation continued to unwind as the effect of the
early-2015 appreciation dissipated and the Swiss franc remained broadly stable against the euro,
with prices in September 2016 decreasing by 0.2 percent over the previous year. Medium-term
inflation expectations, which fell sharply in response to the appreciation, have stabilized at (positive)
0.5 percent alongside the pickup in actual inflation. With activity gradually strengthening, the output
gap continues to narrow.
7.
Swiss interest rates have fallen and the yield curve has flattened in tandem with other
advanced economies, although the franc has appreciated more than most other currencies.
Yields on Swiss government bonds fell and the franc strengthened sharply following the exit from
the exchange rate floor and shift to negative policy rates in late 2014-early 2015. Sovereign yields
across all maturities (the longest dated is 50 years) became negative, although longer rates again
turned positive in recent weeks. After appreciating by about 15 percent against the euro in early
2015, the franc has steadied in recent months, representing a 12 percent depreciation relative to its
strongest level, while the REER has depreciated by 5 percent, although this is still 6 percent stronger
than before the exit from the exchange rate floor. As in other countries, equity prices have been
supported by low interest rates, although the benchmark SMI index is down 8.5 percent so far this
year, possibly reflecting the large share of banks in the index.

REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
A.

Outlook and Risks

Staff’s views
8.
Growth is expected to remain on a recovery path, and to stabilize at a moderate
1¾ percent over the medium term. For 2016, GDP is forecast to increase by 1.5 percent, with
inflation approaching zero by year end. The pickup in growth is projected to gradually close the
output gap, returning inflation to the middle of the target band. However, inflation is expected to
remain below levels in key trading partners, facilitating a steady reduction in the REER. The
underlying external position in 2015 was moderately weaker than implied by medium-term
fundamentals and desirable policy settings (see Box 2). External demand is likely to make a smaller
contribution to growth than in the past owing to the more subdued outlook for global trade,
leading also to some narrowing of the current account surplus.

SWITZERLAND

9.
Risks to this outlook for the Swiss economy, while two sided, maintain a negative skew
(Annex II). On the positive side, a faster than envisaged pace of world growth could materialize if
consistent and comprehensive policy frameworks were widely adopted, thereby providing a boost to
Switzerland’s large export sector. However, several adverse global factors—a further decline in the
trade content of world demand, increased political risk and inward-looking policies, and an
unmooring of inflation expectations that raises forward-looking real interest rates—would weaken
demand from abroad. In addition, a resurgence of global financial market volatility or a further
loosening of monetary policy by a major central bank could trigger renewed capital inflows into
Switzerland, appreciating the already overvalued franc and denting GDP growth. Elevated household
debt and banks’ concentrated exposure to mortgages could amplify shocks, especially if
unemployment were to increase sharply on a sustained basis. Renewed concerns about the financial
health of large cross-border banks could spill over to the domestic economy given their
interconnectedness and large size relative to Swiss GDP. In addition, Swiss-EU economic relations
could be affected in the event no mutually acceptable solution is found in the ongoing discussions
regarding immigration.
Authorities’ views
10.
The recent positive momentum of the Swiss economy is expected to continue,
supported by sustained global demand and the waning effects of the past appreciation.
Growth is expected to reach 1.5 and about 1.8 percent, respectively, in 2016 and 2017, with both
exports and the domestic demand experiencing an upward trend. Continued population growth due
to net immigration—although at a somewhat slower pace than in recent years—is also expected to
support growth. Strengthening activity is projected to raise inflation to 1 percent by end 2018,
gradually reverse the slight pickup in unemployment that occurred since 2015 and eliminate the
negative output gap. However, not all industries have benefitted equally from the recovery, and
profit margins at a large number of companies have come under pressure, consistent with the SNB’s
assessment that the Swiss franc remains significantly overvalued.
11.
Risks to growth remain tilted to the downside. Given the very open Swiss economy,
external shocks would directly impact economic growth. Key external risks include a downgrading of
global growth or a resurgence of financial market volatility. Switzerland also faces a number of
domestic risks, including the possibility that a timely agreement on curtailing immigration is not
achieved. A sustained increase in unemployment that spills over to house prices is a tail risk. Further
downward pressure on global interest rates, if sustained for an extended period, would pose a
significant risk to longer-term financial stability.

combination of tools is intended to reduce the attractiveness of Swiss franc-denominated assets,

The amount of intervention is reflected in changes in sight deposits at the SNB and currency in circulation. Changes
in sight deposits are bi-directional, although FX purchases for intervention dominate.

For banks, negative rates apply on deposits exceeding 20 times minimum required reserves. Currently, aggregate
reserves exceed this threshold by about 40 percent (CHF120 billion or 20 percent of GDP). Arbitrage opportunities
have reportedly encouraged almost all banks to exhaust their buffers.

The SNB’s two-pronged policy approach and accommodative stance are appropriate to
the challenges facing the Swiss economy, and have helped avert a prolonged slowdown and
sustained deflation:


The negative interest differential against major currencies is consistent with the Swiss franc’s role
as a safe haven currency, which constrains policy independence. Relying on a negative marginal
rate helps to deter new inflows by encouraging banks to transmit negative rates to large
investors, while shielding their retail depositors. This also helped preserve banks’ profits, which
depend on the effective policy rate.3 However, the move to negative rates has not been sufficient
to preserve the interest rate differential with major central banks, contributing to persistent
inflow pressures.



Foreign exchange purchases are warranted to address Switzerland’s below-potential output,
overvalued REER and sub-par inflation that is largely exchange rate driven. Moreover, FX
purchases were effective in preventing a sharp appreciation following the Brexit vote, despite a
large jump in inflows, although smaller, higher-frequency purchases are also expanding the
SNB’s balance sheet.

15.
Some refinements could improve the assignment of policy tools and simplify
communications. The negative interest rate differential should be calibrated so as to discourage
persistent inflows that can cause prolonged deflation and weaken activity. On the other hand,
exchange rate purchases should be reserved primarily to respond to episodic inflow surges to
prevent sudden, large exchange rate appreciations. Some widening of the current effective interest
rate differential—either by lowering the marginal policy rate or the exemption threshold—should
therefore be considered to reduce the need for frequent small-scale interventions. This would also

slow the increase in the SNB’s already-large balance sheet, which continues to trend upward relative
to GDP and is subject to valuation changes that can affect public finances.
16.
However, operational and stability considerations could at some point limit the room
for maneuver. Competition between banks and other lenders could over time bid down bank
lending rates, thereby increasing risk taking while also pushing a wider set of deposit rates into
negative territory. This could raise incentives for cash hoarding and erode a key source of bank
funding. In addition, portfolio diversification can reduce but not eliminate valuation risks on the
SNB’s balance sheet. Over the longer term, accommodating some gradual appreciation, as was the
case prior to the GFC, should be considered. Beyond monetary policy, structural reforms should be
considered to narrow the large domestic saving-investment gap and reduce savers’ home bias.
Authorities’ views
17.
The SNB’s expansionary two-pronged monetary policy is working well. With credit
continuing to grow at a moderate pace, and the Swiss franc still significantly overvalued, the
exchange rate is the primary transmission channel for monetary policy. The negative policy rate has
worked well in Switzerland, with the parallel decline in key market rates signaling the effectiveness
and credibility of the policy tool. Tiering has helped limit the impact of negative rates on banks’
profits, thereby avoiding the need for banks to pass along these rates to smaller depositors. There is
little indication of cash hoarding. FX purchases are an important complement to negative policy
rates, facilitating the absorption of large safe haven inflows and also avoiding the need to further
widen the interest differential vis a vis other major central banks. Utilization of these two instruments
is appropriately balanced at present.
18.
Room is available to ease further, but monetary policy alone cannot support the real
economy for an extended period. Keeping interest rates at very negative levels for a long time
could eventually encourage cash hoarding and excessive risk taking. Moreover, while there is no
upper limit to the size of the SNB’s balance sheet, and portfolio diversification has safeguarded its
value, currency exposure is a risk. Nonetheless, there is room to lower the policy rate further, if
needed. However, addressing the economy’s structural shortcomings is beyond the scope of
monetary policy.

Fiscal Policy
Background
19.
Switzerland’s long-standing fiscal rule has led to a decline in public debt. The “debt
brake” rule, introduced in 2003, requires a balanced cyclically-adjusted federal budget on an ex ante
basis, and in case of ex post spending overruns, offsetting structural surpluses are expected in
subsequent years. The rule, together with conservative frameworks at other levels of government,
has delivered a significant reduction in general government debt, which stood at 46 percent of GDP
at end 2015 (Annex III). Moreover, outturns have tended to exceed the targeted balanced structural
position.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

20.
Several fiscal reform initiatives are in the pipeline. Options for meeting the fiscal costs of
aging—including equalizing the retirement age for men and women and raising VAT rates (currently
among the lowest in Europe)—are being discussed by parliament. Eliminating preferential tax
treatment of foreign companies currently offered by several cantons is underway by unifying rates
for all firms within a canton. The new corporate tax rates are expected to average 14–15 percent,
and would likely lead to some revenue loss.
Staff’s views
21.
Switzerland has ample fiscal space in view of its negative borrowing costs, moderate
and declining public debt and broadly balanced general government finances. The current
federal-level debt brake rule allows automatic stabilizers to dampen the business cycle and provides
flexibility for extraordinary spending in the event of “exceptional financial circumstances.”4 With
about 70 percent of general government spending occurring outside the boundaries of the rule, the
rule may not in practice significantly impede the use of fiscal space.
22.
Despite a goal of structural balance, the rule is implemented in a somewhat tighter
manner and could benefit from some refinements in its application. A tendency to not fully
spend budget appropriations and a conservative approach to estimating potential output have led
to systematic ex post structural surpluses that have accumulated to 4 percent of GDP since 2003.
With some two-thirds of the budget pre-committed as transfers to other levels of government,
spending compression is focused on the remaining relatively narrow set of categories, including
education, which can have implications for longer-term growth and competitiveness. With fiscal
policy providing less support than envisaged under the rule, additional pressure is also placed on
monetary policy. Reducing within-year underspending or permitting underspent amounts to be
used the following year by allowing symmetric operation of the rule’s ex post provision would
alleviate this issue. On the other hand, increased transfers to the cantons to partially compensate
them for CIT reform-related revenue loss will further squeeze other federal spending.
23.
In the event of a prolonged downturn or deep recession, a discretionary fiscal stimulus
would provide essential support to economic activity. Moderate public debt, negative borrowing
costs and broadly balanced budgets suggest the presence of ample fiscal space to respond with a
discretionary stimulus in the event of a sizable negative output gap. Supporting the economy by
temporarily setting aside the rule is permitted under the “exceptional financial circumstances”
clause, and would avoid overburdening monetary policy.
24.
The authorities’ proactive approach will help address challenges to pension system
sustainability. With average life expectancy of 83 years, raising retirement ages for men and women
(currently 65 and 64, respectively), together with increasing VAT rates, is essential to generate new
resources to help fill the expected deficit in the first pillar, pay-as-you-go pension system. Additional
pressure is being felt in the private second pillar scheme where the legally-mandated minimum

conversion rate used to translate accumulated savings into an annuity is too high relative to
long-term interest rates and life expectancy. In addition, despite a reduction last year, the
guaranteed interest rate used to compound contributions remains too high. Lowering both the
mandated conversion rate and the compounding rate—by indexing them to a long-term sovereign
bond—would reduce the risk of contingent fiscal liabilities and help ensure the sustainability of the
social safety net.
Authorities’ views
25.
Fiscal policy in Switzerland follows a prudent approach that simultaneously delivers
debt reduction and economic stabilization. Since the GFC, fiscal policy has supported growth
through a healthy pace of infrastructure investment and solid growth in education spending, while
also providing temporary targeted support to employment following the 2015 appreciation. As a
result, the domestic-oriented economy is performing well. This situation contrasts with that of
several other countries where, owing to high public debt, governments have pursued fiscal austerity
that necessitated unconventional monetary easing to compensate for weak government demand.
The debt brake rule, which enjoys broad popular support, has led to a significant reduction of
nominal debt, annual underspending is a modest 0.3 percent of GDP, and there is no need at
present for higher fiscal spending.
26.
The debt brake rule has flexibility in extraordinary times to provide additional
stimulus, which the authorities have shown a readiness to use under appropriate conditions.
The “exceptional circumstances” clause has been previously invoked and will be used again in 2017
for migration-related spending. In general, fiscal stimulus is most effective when domestic
absorption is weak, while monetary policy is best suited to respond to external shocks or when the
export sector is under pressure.
27.
Medium-term fiscal challenges can be addressed without an undue increase in taxes.
To stabilize pension system finances, Parliament is expected to agree by early 2017 a combination of
a higher retirement age for women and an increase in the range of 1–1½ percentage points in the
VAT rate, which will be earmarked for the Old-Age and Survivors’ Insurance. Following full phase-in
of the corporate tax reform in 2019, corporate tax rates are likely to be reduced in the majority of
the cantons, and while rates levied on foreign companies will increase marginally, other factors will
continue to ensure Switzerland remains an attractive foreign investment destination.

Exposure to real estate by lenders and
borrowers is high, notwithstanding a relatively
low home ownership rate of 45 percent. After
10 successive years of increases that raised house
prices by a cumulative 40 percent, prices stabilized
in Q2:2016 and the pace of mortgage lending has
gradually eased to around 3 percent. This reflects a
series of macroprudential measures introduced
during 2012–14, including “self regulatory”
measures by banks that were adopted in response
to moral suasion by the authorities.5 The increase in
the countercyclical capital buffer on mortgages from
one to two percent in 2014, a temporary increase in
mortgage interest rates in 2015 and some slowdown
in population growth also helped to stabilize house
prices. More than 80 percent of banks’ domestic
loans are mortgages (including to corporates), and
among new mortgages, about a third have loan to
value (LtV) ratios of 75 percent or more. Insurance
companies and pension funds have shifted asset
allocations toward real estate in search of higher
returns. Non-mortgage credit is declining. At about
twice disposable income, household debt is one of
the highest among OECD countries, although
financial assets are several times larger and the total
rate of nonperforming loans is a very low 3 percent.

The Swiss systemically-important global banks (G-SIBs) (Credit Suisse and UBS)
continue to increase capital buffers. In response to the evolving business and regulatory
landscape, in recent years these banks have reduced leverage by shrinking their balance sheets
(from a combined 6½ times to 2¾ times GDP) and raising capital, and have shifted toward wealth
and asset management where profits have been resilient. However, the operating environment for
banking remains challenging. As with other G-SIBs, share prices of the large Swiss banks have fallen
5 Key self-regulatory measures are: buyers must acquire a minimum upfront equity stake of 10 percent in the
property through use of own funds (rather than borrowed funds or Pillar 2 or 3 pension assets); mortgages must be
paid down to two-thirds of the value of the property within 15 years; and banks are required to value real estate at
the lower of market value or purchase price. Banks may still issue mortgages that do not meet these and other
self-regulation requirements if they set the risk weight on the entire mortgage to 100 percent.

sharply in recent years, although some recovery has occurred since mid-2016. In July 2016, the Swiss
authorities began implementing stricter too-big-to-fail (TBTF2) regulations for their G-SIBs, and
which are more conservative than Basel minima, requiring them to have sufficient capital to absorb
operating losses and adequate debt capital to fund an orderly resolution.6
Staff’s views
30.
Elevated household debt and banks’ concentrated exposure to mortgages could
amplify macroeconomic shocks, and new measures should be readied and supervision further
strengthened. House prices relative to income have grown significantly since the great recession,
and while prices have recently stabilized, price to income ratios remain stretched. Average debt per
borrower is very high given the relatively low rate of home ownership. A prompt response will be
needed if greater competition in credit markets further bids down interest rates and spurs a
resurgence of mortgage lending or an acceleration of house prices. The response should target the
build-to-rent segment where activity is currently brisk and where larger risk weights and/or faster
amortization relative to owner-occupied properties is appropriate to reflect the international
tendency for higher default and loss rates on these loans. Greater recourse to legally-binding
regulation in preference to banks’ self-regulation could ensure any needed changes are
implemented in timely manner and that uniform standards apply to all mortgage providers. The
stepped up frequency of on-site inspections by the supervisor, FINMA, across all types of banks—
including cantonal banks, as recommended by the 2014 FSAP—is welcome. Further progress is
warranted to refine supervisory arrangements for external bank audits, including to ensure arm’s
length financial relations between banks and auditors providing supervisory services on behalf of

6 The authorities adopted enhanced leverage requirements in July 2016 to address the TBTF problem. The
regulations, referred to as TBTF2, require the G-SIBs to raise leverage ratios to 5 (against Basel III’s requirement of 3)
and the total loss absorbing leverage ratio to 10 percent (or 28.6 percent of risk-weighted assets), with linear phasein by end-2019. The Basel III minimum is 18 percent of risk-weighted assets, and to be reached by January 2022.

regards FINMA’s reliance on external auditors, the 2014 FSAP recommended rotating auditing firms, providing
them more guidance on their supervisory focus, avoiding actual or perceived conflicts of interest with supervised
banks by remunerating them from a FINMA-managed, but bank-financed fund, rather than the audited bank directly
compensating the audit firm.

The new Swiss G-SIB regulations appropriately reflect the systemic risk characteristics
of these banks. The establishment of Swiss holding company structures for the Swiss G-SIBs will
help ensure the survivability of core operations critical to the Swiss financial system. The large size of
these banks relative to the Swiss economy and their potential role in global risk propagation warrant
the requirements on leverage ratios and too-big-too-fail regulations that are more stringent than
minimum international standards. This will also help safeguard the Swiss economy from inward
spillovers. Attention should also be given to risk weights used in internal ratings-based models and
greater disclosure of weights as part of the forthcoming revision to Basel requirements could help to
strengthen credibility.
Authorities’ views
32. Downward pressure on mortgage lending rates could encourage excess supply of
investment properties. The revision of the self-regulation rules for mortgage lending (approved by
FINMA), the activation and increase of the sectoral CCB targeting risks in the domestic mortgage
and real estate markets and the permanent adjustment of risk-weights for high loan-to-value
mortgage loans have all helped to stabilize house prices. Tax incentives favor high mortgage debt,
but at the same time lead to large financial assets for the same individuals, thereby mitigating
financial stability risks. Mandatory amortization and the 20 percent own-funds down payment
requirement also partly offset financial stability risks. Moreover, the widespread application of
conservative mortgage affordability tests (using an interest rate of 5 percent plus an additional
2 percentage points for taxes and maintenance) and comfortable LtV margins provide buffers in
case interest rates rise or house prices decline. However, institutional and private investors—in
search of higher yielding assets—have increased activity in build-to-let properties, where prices are
vulnerable to higher interest rates or slower immigration. A significant premium on risk weights for
investment property mortgages relative to owner-occupied mortgages would be appropriate under
new Basel guidelines.
33.
FSAP recommendations on onsite bank supervision and auditing are constructive.
While continuing to pursue a risk-based supervision model, FINMA has increased the frequency of
onsite inspections across all supervised entities by 10 percent, in line with FSAP recommendations.
On the FSAP recommendation regarding the use of audit firms as extended arms of the supervisory
authority, measures to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the regulatory audit framework
are being assessed, inter alia by introducing the direct mandating of audit firms by FINMA.
34.
New regulatory measures solidify the position of the Swiss G-SIBs, but the systemically
important domestic banks (D-SIBs) and transparency of risk weights require further attention.
The recently implemented stricter capital standards are crucial to reduce the likelihood of spillovers
among G-SIBs and from the G-SIBs to the domestic economy thereby increasing financial stability.
Reflecting the long phase-in periods, it will take several years to bring the gone-concern capital
buffers to the prescribed regulatory levels. To further reduce systemic risks, gone-concern capital
requirements for D-SIBs are necessary. Discussions about the implementation of such regulations
are currently taking place. Finally, greater transparency on risk weights, expected to be required by
the new Basel standards, would be an important improvement.

remained at about 23 percent, well below the
saving rate. As a result, labor productivity has grown relatively slowly and has been outpaced by real
wages.
36.
Switzerland continues to make progress with implementing international standards
for cooperation and information sharing in the financial sector. A comprehensive AML/CFT risk
assessment has been published last year and strengthened due diligence requirements for financial
intermediaries became effective in 2016. An assessment of the implementation of Financial Action
Task Force (FATF) recommendations and of their effectiveness has been adopted by the FATF in
October and is scheduled for publication shortly. The legal basis for the automatic exchange of
information on tax matters was adopted in 2015, and Switzerland agreed with the EU and several
other states and territories that it will begin collecting data in 2017, with data exchange
commencing in 2018. Corporate tax reform by the cantons will align the corporate tax code with
international initiatives to counter base erosion and profit shifting.
Staff’s views
37.
Strengthening productivity would help mitigate possible appreciation shocks while
also allowing firms to adapt in the event of a slowdown in labor force growth. Preserving close
economic ties with the EU by reaching pragmatic solutions is crucial given sizable trade and
economic linkages. Continuing to welcome foreign workers and adequately funding education are
also essential to secure long-run growth, especially in frontier technologies. However, increasing the
rate of investment would rebalance the capital-labor ratio, and help ensure that Swiss wages remain
aligned with productivity levels. The planned harmonization of tax rates on domestic and foreign
firms, to be achieved by sharply reducing the upper rate and modestly raising the lower rate, will
increase incentives for domestic firms to invest, enabling them to improve efficiency, become more
flexible and better cope any future strengthening of the exchange rate.
38.
Increasing transparency and cooperation in the financial sector helps to level the
playing field among participating countries while also protecting Switzerland’s integrity as an
international financial center. Building on recent progress, the authorities are encouraged to
further strengthen the enforcement of FATF and OECD standards. In particular, it is key to ensure

private banks and wealth managers comply with customer due diligence requirements, to promote
entity transparency, and to sustain effective international cooperation.
Authorities’ views
39.
The economy demonstrated resilience and flexibility in response to the large exchange
rate appreciation and should continue to build on these achievements. Switzerland strongly
supports open markets, and maintaining bilateral agreements with the EU is essential. Structural
reforms are needed to increase competitiveness, and continuing to adequately fund research
universities is a priority to remain a world leader in innovation and to create private sector spin-offs.
However, large capital inflows that result from globally loose monetary policies, remain an ongoing
challenge for the economy.
40.
Switzerland has been an early adopter of numerous international initiatives, and
related laws are strictly enforced. However, given Swiss banks’ major role in global wealth
management, these banks tend to be more exposed than others to money laundering concerns,
especially in emerging markets. FINMA has repeatedly warned banks to be vigilant for these risks
and has stepped up its efforts by more intensive and proactive supervision. FINMA pursues suspect
cases and, imposes administrative sanctions (disgorgement of profits, ban to enter new business
relations with PEP) initiates enforcement proceedings against individuals, and forwards cases to the
criminal authorities where appropriate.

STAFF APPRAISAL
41.
The Swiss economy adapted well to the sharp appreciation that followed the exit from
the exchange rate floor in early 2015. Flexibility by firms and the labor market, together with an
effective monetary and fiscal policy response, helped to cushion the impact and facilitate
adjustment. As a result, growth remained positive, the current account surplus was resilient, and
consumers’ real purchasing power was boosted by the drop in prices. Nonetheless, segments of the
economy remain pressured by the moderately overvalued real exchange rate.
42.
The economy is forecast to return to moderate growth, although downside risks could
cloud this outlook. GDP is expected to grow by 1½ percent in 2016, and to stabilize at 1¾ percent
over the medium term. This trajectory is consistent with gradually closing the output gap and
unwinding the real overvaluation. However, important external and domestic risks could affect this
outlook, including renewed capital inflow surges, further weakening of global growth, sharp
domestic property price movements, concerns about the health of large global banks and changes
to Swiss-EU economic relations.
43.
Monetary policy should remain accommodative by discouraging inflow pressures. The
SNB’s two-pronged approach, which combines a negative interest rate and foreign exchange
purchases, has helped avert a prolonged slowdown and sustained deflation. This has been achieved

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SWITZERLAND

notwithstanding the Swiss franc’s role as a safe haven currency, which limits policy independence.
Notably, a sharp appreciation following the Brexit vote was avoided despite a jump in inflows.
44.
While room for maneuver is ultimately limited, some rebalancing of policy tools would
improve policy effectiveness and simplify communications. Scope further remains to widen the
negative policy rate differential relative to other major currencies in order to reduce the need for
frequent small-scale interventions. This would reserve foreign currency purchases for responding
primarily to large episodic inflow surges. However, both tools are subject to increasing costs—risks
of cash hoarding and financial instability in the case of negative interest rates, and the potential for
valuation losses on the SNB’s expanding balance sheet in the case of intervention—which warrants a
cautious approach. Given these constraints, over the longer term, some additional upward flexibility
for the Swiss franc should be a policy option.
45.
Within the existing debt brake framework, fiscal policy could provide additional
support to the economy. The rule’s automatic stabilizers help to dampen the business cycle.
However, a tendency to underspend approved allocations and a conservative approach to
estimating the output gap results in a tendency to overshoot the structural balance objective that, at
the margin, places additional pressure on monetary policy. Moreover, the success of the rule at
lowering public debt and keeping budgets broadly balanced, together with the current negative
borrowing costs, suggests ample fiscal space exists for a discretionary stimulus in the event a sizable
output gap were to open. This flexibility, which is permitted under the rule’s “exceptional
circumstances” clause, would avoid overburdening monetary policy.
46.
Elevated exposure to real estate by borrowers and lenders could amplify shocks,
calling for timely preparation of new property-related measures and strengthened
supervision. Credit and house price dynamics have slowed in response to previous macroprudential
policies and higher lending rates by banks. However, competition among banks and also from
nonbank lenders could drive down rates, triggering a renewed upswing in the mortgage
credit-and-house price cycle. Pre-emptively preparing new tightening measures is warranted, with a
focus on the build-to-let segment and relying on legally-binding regulation. Further progress is
needed to align incentives for external auditors tasked with performing supervisory functions.
47.
The too-big-to-fail regulations governing the Swiss G-SIBs reflect their systemic risk
characteristics and their large size relative to the Swiss economy. These regulations are
appropriately more stringent than the Basel minimum requirements. In addition, risk weights used in
banks’ internal ratings-based models should be reviewed, and in the context of the ongoing Basel
review, require banks to provide more information on their weights, which would strengthen the
credibility of their financial reporting.
48.
Early adjustment of pension system parameters will help protect the long-term
viability of the social safety net. Rapid population aging will increase future fiscal obligations.
Raising retirement ages for women and men and increasing VAT rates with revenue earmarked for
pensions will help to narrow the gap in the publicly-funded first pillar pension. Lowering the
conversion rate used to calculate annuity payments to better reflect expected interest rates and life

expectancy and aligning the rate for compounding premiums with market interest rates would
strengthen the stability of the second-pillar, defined-contribution scheme.
49.
Continuing to meet international standards is essential to preserve Switzerland as a
prime destination for foreign investment and protect the integrity of its banks. Widespread
international cooperation is needed to achieve a level playing field across jurisdictions, and Swiss
legal standards should continue to adapt to evolving AML/CFT and tax transparency standards.
Identified lapses, including in those that could arise the context of the recent FATF evaluation,
should be vigorously pursued.
50.
Strengthening productivity would protect the economy from future exchange rate
shocks and a possible slowing of the labor force, while keeping it at the technology forefront.
Preserving close economic ties with the EU while continuing to welcome foreign workers is essential
to safeguard Switzerland’s high standard of living. The corporate income tax reform may help raise
investment rates by small and medium-sized firms, allowing them to boost productivity, underpin
wages and build resilience in the event of an appreciation.
51.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard
12-month cycle.

Box 1. Possible Implications for EU Relations of the
2014 Referendum Restricting Immigration
An initiative to limit immigration narrowly won a Swiss referendum vote in 2014. A binding
referendum in February 2014 to introduce quotas for immigration won the popular vote with a slim majority
(50.3 percent), and was also approved by a majority of cantons, thereby satisfying the double-majority
requirement to amend the constitution. In line with the new constitutional article, a law to limit immigration
should be put in place by February 2017.
Impeding the free flow of labor from the EU could breach bilateral treaties and impede Switzerland’s
access to the single market. Since voting down membership to the European Economic Area in the early
1990s, Switzerland secured access to EU markets through some 120 bilateral accords. A series of core
agreements, including a requirement to allow EU citizens to work within Switzerland without restriction,
contain a “guillotine clause” that would invalidate all accords if any individual one were terminated.
Switzerland is also a member of the Schengen area of border-free travel. Cancellation of these arrangements
has the potential to severely constrain Swiss companies’ access to EU markets, which absorb more than half
of Switzerland’s exports and are the source for three-quarters of its imports. It could also impede trade in
financial services.
Moreover, the Swiss labor market relies heavily on foreign workers, including highly skilled ones.
Foreigners account for more than half the increase in the labor force, which has grown by 13½ percent since
2002. Many are cross-border commuters from neighboring EU countries, facilitated by Switzerland’s
inclusion in the Schengen area. At present, there is a significant share of foreign nationals in the workingage population, many of whom are highly skilled and fill critical positions in hi-tech industries. Foreigners
also contribute importantly to the Swiss old age pension system. Limits on foreign workers would dampen
confidence and investment, as well as impeding output growth.
No compromise has been reached with the EU, but talks are continuing. The lower house of parliament
has proposed a measure that provides some advance notice of job openings to people residing in
Switzerland. The upper house has yet to vote, and any approved measure would need to be discussed with
the EU. The Brexit vote could have a bearing on the Swiss-EU discussions, which could extend to broader
issues including an institutional framework to allow Swiss laws to adjust swiftly to changes in EU rules.

Box 2. External Sector Assessment
Staff sees the Swiss external position as moderately weaker (and the real exchange rate as
moderately stronger) than implied by medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies. The EBA
analysis points to a positive current account gap of around 5 percent of GDP in 2015, however, idiosyncratic
factors (large exchange rate and other valuation losses on the net international investment position (NIIP), as
well as non-traditional inflows; see Annex I) reduce the gap to -4 to +2 percent of GDP. In view of the large
valuation losses in recent years, which depend in part on the size of gross foreign assets and liabilities, the
realized current account surplus has been insufficient to stabilize the NIIP.1 Moreover, the EBA REER models
suggest the REER was 16–23 percent overvalued on average during 2015, although this reflects in part the
implicit mean reversion in the model. Taking into consideration the EBA estimates from both the current
account and REER models, as well as staff’s broader analysis, staff assesses the franc to have been
moderately (10 percent) above the level consistent with fundamentals and desirable policy settings on
average during 2015. However, this assessment is subject to considerable uncertainty, in part reflecting
inconsistent findings across the EBA models. Subsequent developments (a lower NEER and more negative
inflation in Switzerland than in its trading partners) suggest that the extent of overvaluation for 2016 may
have decreased.

1/ The figure reported is based on the estimated current account gap and an assumed elasticity with respect to the
REER. The elasticity used is a common elasticity assumption of 0.71 for exports and 0.92 for imports, adjusted by
the size of exports and imports in GDP. Note that closure of a current account gap generally would require a shift
in saving or investment rates as well as a movement in the REER. Negative value denotes undervaluation.
2/ After multilateral consistency adjustment.

Changes in the NIIP can arise from three sources: (a) acquisition of foreign assets and incurrence of foreign liabilities
(the corollary of the current account); (b) changes in the measurement and sampling of data; and (c) changes in the value
of assets and liabilities. In the case of Switzerland, valuation effects are likely to be significant in view of (i) the large size
of gross foreign assets and liabilities, (ii) large shifts in bilateral exchange rates, (iii) the large imbalance between foreign
currency-denominated assets and liabilities owing to the higher share of foreign assets denominated in foreign currency
as compared with foreign (and foreign currency denominated) liabilities; and (iv) the larger share of foreign liabilities than
foreign assets in the form of equities. Because of (iii) and (iv), the effect of exchange rate and equity price movements on
the NIIP is not symmetric. See the Swiss National Bank’s “Swiss Balance of Payments and International Investment
Position, 2015.”

Assessment. Switzerland’s large gross liabilities and the volatility of its capital flows present risks, but these are
mitigated by Switzerland’s large net asset position and foreign reserves.
Current
account

Background. Switzerland tends to run large CA surpluses, which are volatile due to large temporary swings in the
income balance. Preliminary estimates indicate that the CA surplus was 11.4 percent of GDP in 2015, up from
8.8 percent of GDP in 2014. The increase was mainly due to a higher income balance, with the trade balance mostly
unchanged. Switzerland’s terms of trade improved by less than 2 percent in 2015, with negligible effects on the CA.
Assessment. The EBA CA regression approach estimates a CA gap of around 5 percent of GDP in 2015, reflecting a
cyclically-adjusted CA surplus of 11.4 percent of GDP and an EBA CA regression-estimated norm of 6.4 percent of
GDP. However, as a measure of wealth accumulation, Switzerland’s CA surplus is misleadingly high due to several
factors: (i) Switzerland’s low inflation combined with its large net foreign-currency position, which boosts its net
nominal income flows; 1/ (ii) Switzerland’s negative net portfolio investment position, which results in large
reductions in its NIIP due to equity price appreciation but is not captured in the CA flows; 2/ and (iii) various nontraditional flows (e.g., merchanting activities) that may be only tangentially related to the real Swiss economy. 3/
Adjusting for these effects and taking into account the negative CA gaps implied by the EBA REER models (see
below), staff estimate a CA gap ranging from -4 to 2 percent of GDP. The range reflects the unusually high
uncertainties related to the anomalies discussed above and the potential for large revisions to the 2015 CA
estimate.

Real
exchange
rate

Background. The REER (CPI basis) appreciated by 26 percent from 2007 to 2011. In September 2011, the SNB
established a floor of 1.20 for the CHF/EUR exchange rate, and the REER depreciated by 4 percent during 2011–14.
The SNB exited from the floor on January 15, 2015, and the REER immediately appreciated. For the full year 2015,
the REER was 8 percent above its 2014 level. As of June 2016, the REER was 2 percent below its 2015 average.
Assessment. The EBA REER index and level regression-based estimates suggest that the average REER in 2015 was
16–23 percent overvalued. Taking into consideration these estimates, the smaller estimates implied by staff’s CA
assessment, and staff’s broader analysis, staff assesses the franc to be moderately above the level consistent with
fundamentals and desirable policy settings in 2015 (REER gap of -5 to 25 percent).

Overall Assessment
Overall Assessment:
The underlying external
position in 2015 was
moderately weaker than
implied by medium-term
fundamentals and
desirable policy settings.
However, Switzerland’s
external assessment is
subject to high
uncertainty due to
various anomalies and
contrasting indicators.
The modest REER
depreciation in the first
part of 2016 does not
alter the assessment.
Potential policy
responses:
Macroeconomic policies
should be geared toward
promoting faster growth,
exiting deflation, and
avoiding imbalances.
Continued monetary
policy accommodation,
including if necessary via
purchases of foreign
assets (given limited
options for other
methods of monetary
easing) should assist
these objectives.

Annex I. External Sector Assessment

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Background. Switzerland is a financial center with a positive net international investment position (NIIP) of about
95 percent of GDP and large gross foreign asset and liability positions of 667 and 571 percent of GDP, respectively,
at end-2015. The NIIP to GDP ratio has declined over the last 10 years, despite CA surpluses averaging 10 percent
of GDP, due to negative valuation effects and other stock-flow adjustments that have averaged -9.5 percent of GDP
per year and been negative in 8 of 10 years. These persistent negative valuation effects have been driven mainly by
nominal exchange rate and equity price appreciation. 1/ 2/ These negative valuation effects are projected to
continue, including because inflation is projected to remain lower in Switzerland than in other AEs, and the
NIIP-to-GDP ratio is projected to continue declining despite continued large CA surpluses.

Overall Assessment

Background. Significant net outward FDI (mostly reinvested earnings) has been a consistent feature of the financial
account in recent years, although bank lending flows have become critical since the crisis. The SNB absorbed very
large safe-haven inflows (intermediated by the banking system) during 2009–12 through reserve accumulation.
Assessment. Safe-haven capital inflows may accelerate in the event of a re-emergence of global market turmoil.
Background. The SNB accumulated foreign exchange reserves of about 80 percent of GDP during 2009–15 in
various rounds of intervention, including to defend the CHF/EUR floor. By end-2015, the SNB’s balance sheet
reached 95 percent of GDP. Since the SNB exited from the floor, the franc has floated between 1.00–1.10 CHF/EUR,
with the SNB intervening periodically.
Assessment. Reserves are large relative to GDP but more moderate relative to external liabilities. Substantial reserves
are explained in part by the volatility of capital flows. In recent years, interventions have been monetary policy
operations aimed at avoiding persistent inflation undershooting (inflation averaged -0.5 percent during 2012–15)
and given limited scope for easing via other monetary policy tools. In particular, the supply of domestic assets
available for purchase is limited (the outstanding stock of federal government bonds is 12 percent of GDP), and the
interest rate on central bank deposits is very low at -0.75 percent. Interventions have also helped limit exchange rate
overvaluation.

Technical
Background
Notes

35

SWITZERLAND

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

1/ Inflation in Switzerland has been, and is expected to remain, roughly 1 percentage point lower than in most other
major advanced economies. Consequently, nominal returns tend to be higher on foreign-currency assets than on
franc-denominated assets. This in turn boosts Switzerland’s income balance given its large net foreign-currency asset
position of about 400 percent of GDP. However, this is a nominal and not a real effect—the positive income flow is
fully offset by a negative NIIP valuation effect due to nominal appreciation of the franc if the real exchange rate
remains constant. For example, a 1 percent nominal appreciation of the franc against all other currencies (due to
Swiss inflation that is 1 percentage point lower than foreign inflation) per year reduces Switzerland’s NIIP by
approximately 4 percent of GDP per year.
2/ Switzerland has a negative net equity portfolio position of roughly 70 percent of GDP. Most of the returns on
equities are distributed via equity price appreciation (capital gains) rather than via dividends and hence are not
captured via income outflows in the CA but rather via negative NIIP valuation effects. Consequently, Switzerland’s CA
tends to overstate the degree to which CA flows result in net wealth accumulation. For example, 5 percent equity
price appreciation per year reduces Switzerland’s NIIP by about 3.5 percent of GDP per year.
3/ For further discussion of non-traditional flows, see Annex 1 of the 2015 Switzerland Article IV staff report.

Medium

High
Switzerland is a major financial center
and is seen as a safe haven. Flight to
safety would lead to sharp
appreciation pressures on Swiss franc
assets. The franc appreciation adds to
deflation and hurts Swiss
competitiveness and growth.

Ease monetary policy via FX

downturn is deep and/or
sustained.

High

Medium
Swiss banks may need to adjust their
existing business models to comply
with new international initiatives to
curtail bank secrecy and tax
avoidance schemes, and the process
could affect bank profitability. Brexit
could limit scope for “passporting”
across the EU from the UK.

Compliance and effective

alternative EU banking
“gateways”.

High/Medium

High/Medium
The Swiss economy is very open to
trade and financial flows. A slowdown
in Europe or the US – two of its main
trading partners – would dampen
Swiss GDP growth. Similarly, major
EMs (especially in Asia) are an
important source of external demand.

Ease monetary policy by
further reducing the policy
rate. If operational or
economic lower-bound
constraints on interest rates
are hit, consider preannounced regular FX
purchases. Temporarily
suspend the fiscal rule to
allow a sustained
countercyclical stimulus.

High

High
Re-introducing immigration quotas
could restrict access to skilled
workers and EU markets, weakening
long-run growth. Unilaterally altering
migration arrangements with the EU
could affect other contracts and areas
of cooperation. Brexit is likely to
complicate Switzerland’s own
“Swexit” negotiations with EU.

Seek to limit economic
fallout by preserving
efficient flows of goods,
labor and financial services
with the EU.

Likelihood

1

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to
materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline
(“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a
probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the
time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

Annex III. Debt Sustainability Analysis1
Summary: Public debt sustainability risks remain contained due to the strict implementation of
fiscal rules and the low stock of public debt.
Baseline scenario: The key assumptions underlying the baseline scenario are a gradual but steady
recovery of economic growth and the continued adherence to federal and sub-federal fiscal rules.
Under the baseline scenario, public debt is projected to decline from 46 percent of GDP in 2016 to
about 41 percent of GDP in 2021. Gross financing needs are expected to remain around 10 percent
of GDP during the medium term.
Stress tests: The main risk to debt dynamics is a negative growth shock. Other risks such as an
adverse interest rate shock or a shock to financing needs affect the public debt trajectory only to a
minor extent.


Real GDP growth shock. Real GDP growth rates are assumed to be one standard deviation
(1.8 percent) below the baseline during 2016–17. Under this scenario, the debt-to-GDP ratio
rises to 49 percent in 2018 (about 4 percentage points higher than the baseline).



Primary balance shock. The primary balance in 2017–18 is hit by a negative shock of
0.4 percent of GDP. This shock results in a debt-to-GDP ratio that is only slightly above the
baseline during 2016–21.



Real interest rate shock. The nominal interest rate increases by 200 basis points during
2017–21. The debt-to-GDP ratio becomes slightly higher than the baseline but continues
declining.



Real exchange rate shock. This scenario assumes that the nominal CHF/USD exchange rate
increases by 8 percent in 2017 relative to its 2016 level. As with other non-growth related
shocks, the impact of this shock on the trajectory of public debt is minor.



Combined shock. A simultaneous combination of the previous three shocks would result in
an increasing debt-to-GDP ratio that approached 49 percent in 2018 (approximately
4 percentage points higher than the baseline). However, after 2018, the debt would start
declining on a trajectory that is parallel to the one under the baseline scenario.

Annex IV. The Swiss G-SIBs
The Swiss banking system is dominated by
two G-SIBs. UBS and Credit Suisse (CS)
account for 48 percent of on-shore Swiss
banking sector assets. The rest comprises
24 cantonal banks (commercial banks owned
and in most cases guaranteed by the
government), the Raiffeisen (cooperative)
group, foreign banks, and smaller regional
savings banks and private banks.

foreign. Income sources are regionally
diversified. For example, UBS earns only about one quarter of its income in Switzerland, while nearly
40 percent is derived from the Americas, where it holds nearly half of its assets. Finally, asset and
wealth management is the largest source of their income, while net interest income represents a
smaller share.

The large size of their balance sheets (approximately 300 percent of Swiss GDP) and their
global systemic importance necessitate strict regulation. In July 2016, the Swiss authorities
implemented stricter capital and leverage requirements for the two G-SIBs. The requirements exceed
those required by the Basel III regulatory framework and aim to ensure that (i) the banks have
enough capital to absorb losses and (ii) in the event of insolvency, banks have enough loss
absorbing capital to isolate taxpayers from the too-big-too-fail risk. These new requirements (also
known as TBTF2) are planned to be fully phased in by end-2019, with both banks being on track to
meet the requirements.

UBS and Credit Suisse have improved their
leverage and capital ratios by increasing their
capital as well as by reducing assets. After the
global financial crisis, the G-SIBs have shrunk their
balance sheets, including to meet new capital
requirements. During 2013–15 leverage ratios
increased by approximately ¼ of a percentage
point through capital raising but also by shrinking
balance sheets, mainly affecting their foreign—
rather than Swiss— exposures.

While the G-SIBs are predominantly internationally oriented, their links to the domestic
economy are of great importance for macrofinancial stability and economic growth. The
G-SIBs play an important role in the domestic economy. They account for approximately 50 percent

of all deposits, 40 percent of outstanding mortgages, and 36 percent of employees in the banking
sector.1,2 However, their role in the economy has declined somewhat in response to their need to
deleverage, with other domestic banks increasing their shares in domestic credit supply. Moreover,
due to their large foreign presence, the G-SIBs could serve as conduits for the inward transfer of
global risks to the domestic economy.

Assuming that their share of value added is proportional to their share of employment, it follows that they account
for 35 percent of the value added in the Swiss banking sector or more than 2 percent of Swiss GDP.

Annex V. 2014 FSAP Update—Status of
Key Recommendations
Recommendation

Actions Taken by the Authorities

Short term
Impose a leverage ratio on the banks that is tougher than
international minima.

The Federal Council adopted the amendments to the current
too-big-to-fail provisions on 11 May 2016, thereby addressing
the need for action identified in the February 2015 evaluation
report on too-big-to-fail risks in Switzerland.
The amended TBTF2 framework entered into force on 1 July 2016
and has a Leverage Ratio calibration which, once fully phased in,
will be among the highest in the world. The going-concern
leverage ratio requirement will be 5 percent (with at least
3.5 percent CET1) for the two G-SIBs and 4.5 to 4.625 percent
(with a minimum of 3 to 3.125 percent CET1) for the three D-SIBs.
The gone concern leverage ratio requirement will also be
5 percent for the two G-SIBs, of which 2 percent will be subject to
a rebate depending on their demonstrated progress in improving
their resolvability beyond the required minimum. The gone
concern requirement for D-SIBs is not yet defined for the D-SIBs.
The Federal Council is expected to make specific
recommendations regarding gone concern requirements for
D-SIBs in early 2017.

Remain alert to the build-up of risks in domestic real

Since the FSAP exercise in 2014 the authorities have continued to

estate and mortgage markets. Fully enforce

enforce self-regulation and have required banks to take the

self-regulation, and consider further raising the

following measures: (1) stricter amortization requirements; (2) use

countercyclical capital buffer and introducing additional

of second incomes for financial sustainability evaluation; and

tools (e.g., debt-to-income (DTI) and loan-to-value (LTV)
limits).

(3) valuation of properties for mortgages. Further, FINMA
conducted on-site supervisory reviews focusing on investment
properties, carried out mortgage stress tests of banks and
followed up on any unusual findings.
FINMA and the SNB closely monitor real estate and mortgage
market trends. Lending volumes on the Swiss mortgage market
and real estate prices are growing more slowly than in 2014.
Imbalances have increased slightly due to comparatively weaker
macroeconomic trends, but the resilience of banks has not
deteriorated and their capitalization has improved. There are no
current plans to introduce new macroprudential tools.

Recommendation

Actions Taken by the Authorities

Short term
Bring Financial Market Infrastructures (FMIs) into compliance

With the revision of the National Bank Ordinance in July 2013

with new international principles and establish crisis
management arrangements between the authorities of FMIs.

the relevant international principles for FMIs were largely
incorporated in the Swiss regulatory framework. The relevant
provisions of the National Bank Ordinance were later
transferred to the Financial Market Infrastructure Act and
remaining regulatory gaps have been closed with the entry
into force of this new act (and related ordinances) on
1 January 2016. The Financial Market Infrastructure Act is fully
compliant with the PFMIs and has been recognized as
equivalent with EU CCP regulation (EMIR) by the EU
Commission.
FINMA and the SNB are currently discussing arrangements to
ensure effective coordination and cooperation between the
authorities and FMIs in FMI-specific crisis scenarios. As far as
foreign authorities are concerned, crisis management
mechanisms will be integrated in all updated or newly signed
MoUs.

Establish transparency in the financial sector as a core element

The BCBS’s revised pillar 3 disclosure requirements of January

of the Swiss “brand,” in particular through heightening banks’

2015 were implemented in the new FINMA Circular 2016/1

disclosure requirements, including as regards capital
weighting and providing data for adequate risk analysis.

and entered into force 1 January 2016. Disclosure
requirements have been increased for all institutions. As a next
step, FINMA will implement the new Basel proposals which are
currently out for consultation (consultative document of
March 2016: “Pillar 3 disclosure requirements – consolidated
and enhanced framework”).
Previous measures in this area include the 2014 revision of
FINMA’s accounting guidelines for banks and securities
dealers to require greater transparency and the
implementation of the recommendations of the Enhanced
Disclosure Task Force by the two big banks, leading to
increased transparency regarding RWA.
Concerning the two G-SIBs FINMA has motivated both banks
to continuously improve their disclosure on risk weighting,
with improvements in the qualitative disclosure observed
during the last two years. However, they have not
quantitatively disclosed the differences between RWA based
on internal and standard models.
With regard to insurers, Article 111a Insurance Supervision
Ordinance requires publication of a financial report at least
once a year. On this basis, the new Circular 2016/2
“Disclosure” requires standardized disclosure to provide more
comparable and more transparent information to the market
and policyholders.

additional requirements in respect of organization and
corporate governance (e.g. independent risk management and
compliance functions and the Own Risk and Solvency
Assessment (ORSA)). Quantitative measures have been added
to the existing qualitative liquidity requirements.
Public disclosure requirements for insurers have been
increased by requiring insurers to report publicly on their
activities, profits, risk management, risk profile, methods for
defining technical provisions, capital management, and
solvability.
Supervision of insurance brokers has been enhanced through
the requirement to report to FINMA certain items from
criminal records.

and can utilize the escape clause if the outlook was to deteriorate significantly.

Move ahead with pension and corporate tax
reforms.

First pillar pension system and corporate tax reform are ongoing.

Monetary Policy
Monetary policy should be kept loose, with
further easing via a pre-announced program of
asset purchases.

Monetary policy has been kept accomodative, with a focus on ad hoc FX

The SNB is continuing to rebuild capital buffers.

Financial Sector Policy
Move ahead with TBTF reforms and tighten
leverage ratio requirements for G-SIBs.

Further TBTF measures have been signed into law, requiring additional capital
on both a going-concern and gone-concern basis. The measures are being
gradually phased in by the Swiss G-SIBs.

Challenge risk weights from internal ratingbased (IRB) capital models and increase
disclosure requirements.

Banks‘ IRB models will adjusted in line with upcoming changes to the Basel
guidance on risk weights.

Annex VII. Firm-Level Effects of the Franc Appreciation Following
the Removal of the Exchange Rate Floor
The sizable franc appreciation that followed the removal of the floor against the euro
affected the real economy via numerous channels. In addition to the noticeable effect on
headline inflation, one of the primary effects was to weaken the environment for the exportable
sector vis-à-vis its foreign competitors. Although the franc recovered somewhat following the initial
shock, it remained 13 percent stronger against the euro six months after the shock than it had been
prior to the removal of the floor.1
The effect on Swiss firms differed substantially by sector but the overall effect was negative.
In a questionnaire by the SNB conducted six months after the removal of the floor, firms were asked
about the effect of the currency’s appreciation on their operations as well as their initial and
expected reactions.2 As shown in the chart below, the largest negative effects were felt in the
manufacturing sector where nearly half of survey respondents reported significantly negative effects,
with a further third reporting moderately negative effects. Services were less negatively affected,
however, and construction was on the whole positively affected because of the lower price of
imports. Overall, approximately 70 percent of firms reported a significantly or moderately negative
effect.

The primary channel through which firms were impacted was through their profit margins.
Nearly all adversely-affected firms reduced their franc-equivalent prices, as shown in the following
chart. In addition, nearly half of firms saw reduced sales volumes. Domestic sales were particularly
affected, with domestic-oriented firms seeing declining sales volume despite reduced margins and
lower sales prices.

1

As of October 2016, the franc was 9 percent stronger in nominal terms against the euro than before the floor was
removed.

See SNB Quarterly Bulletin 3/2015.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SWITZERLAND

Despite the finding that nearly half of firms reduced their sales volume, labor market data
indicate the appreciation had only a mild effect on employment (see chart below). Employment
in manufacturing appears to have been the most affected, although the effect was generally modest
and occurred with a delay of about one year. Overall, the unemployment rate has risen by a limited
0.3 percentage points since the floor was removed, registering 3.2 percent in September 2016. This
limited labor market impact could reflect the temporary targeted fiscal support to encourage
employment retention by firms, thereby helping firms and workers weather the appreciation.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:
The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate of the Swiss franc is
determined by market forces in the foreign exchange market, and all settlements are made at free
market rates. On January 15, 2015, the SNB ended the exchange rate floor of CHF 1.20 per euro, and
the franc has since been floating. However, the SNB may intervene in the foreign exchange market.
The SNB publishes information regarding its foreign exchange transactions in its annual
accountability report. The de facto exchange rate regime is a floating arrangement as the exchange

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of October 2016)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is adequate for Fund surveillance. Switzerland publishes timely economic
statistics and posts most of the data and the underlying documentation on the internet.
National Accounts: National Accounts are timely (including the expenditure, production and
income approaches). GDP by canton and a detailed disaggregation of GDP by industry are published
with a significant lag, however, with 2014 data being released in late 2016. Responsibility for national
accounts compilation is split between two different agencies: quarterly national accounts are
published by the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs, and annual national accounts are published by
the Federal Statistics Office.
Price Statistics: Consumer price indices and producer and import price indices are collected by the
Federal Statistical Office. They are published monthly with a base period of December 2015. The
Federal Statistical Office is developing additional producer price indexes for services and construction
(currently published just twice a year). A comprehensive producer price index is expected to be
compiled in the near future.
Government Finance Statistics: General government finance statistics are compiled by the
Federal Finance Administration. Data for general government are finalized with a considerable
lag, mainly due to delays in compiling fiscal accounts at the level of cantons and communes.
Data that are available through 2014 remain of a provisional nature due to ongoing efforts to
reconcile data with the Swiss system of national accounts. Revisions may result in changes to the
data due to coverage, valuation, and recording of transactions associated with the restructuring
and funding of public sector pension funds and payment of retirement benefits. It is planned to
publish final data after concluding the reconciliation exercise in the summer of 2017. The Swiss
National Bank publishes statistics on outstanding and new bond issues by the Swiss
confederation.
Monetary and Financial Statistics: The Swiss National Bank reports monetary statistics for the
monetary authorities, deposit money banks, and other banking institutions for publication in the
IMF’s International Financial Statistics on a monthly basis. However, data are reported using report
forms that are not fully consistent with the Standardized Report Forms developed based on the
IMF’s Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual.
Financial sector surveillance: Switzerland reports 12 core Financial Soundness Indicators
(FSIs) and 9 additional FSIs for deposit takers, and 3 FSIs for real estate markets. All FSIs are
reported on an annual basis. The FSI data and metadata have been posted on the IMF’s FSI
website.

4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SWITZERLAND

External sector statistics: BOP and international investment position data are published based on the
sixth edition of the IMF’s Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual (BPM6).
Official data in BPM6 format are available from 1999 onwards. To ensure that new and old data are
comparable and to ensure that data users have long data series at their disposal, the SNB formally
reclassified the old data series in line with BPM6. Switzerland reports to the IMF annual data on the
Coordinated Direct Investment Survey and semi-annual data on the Coordinated Portfolio Investment
Survey.
II. Data Standards and Quality
In June 1996, Switzerland subscribed to the IMF’s Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS),
and its metadata are currently posted on the Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board. Switzerland
is in full observance of SDDS requirements, and is availing itself of the SDDS’s flexibility options
on dissemination of production index data (for periodicity and timeliness) and of wages and
earnings data (for periodicity). The Swiss Federal Council has announced its support for
Switzerland’s participation in the IMF’s extended statistical standard SDDS Plus. Implementing the
requirements of SDDS Plus in Switzerland—a task in which an interagency working group (SIF,
SNB, FSO, FFA, FSIO, SECO, and FINMA) plays an active role—will take several years.

Statement by Paul Inderbinen, Alternate Executive Director for Switzerland
and Sebastien Waelti, Senior Advisor to the Executive Director
November 21, 2016
On behalf of our Swiss authorities, we would like to thank staff for their valuable report. This
report provides a thorough and insightful analysis of the macroeconomic situation, and adds
significant value to the domestic policy debate in Switzerland. In most aspects, we share
staff's assessment of the challenges going forward and welcome their candid policy
recommendations.
Outlook
We generally agree with staff on the outlook, and expect growth to remain on a recovery
path. According to the latest forecasts of the Federal Government’s Expert Group published
in September this year, GDP growth is projected to reach 1.5 percent in 2016 and 1.8 percent
in 2017. While we broadly share staff’s assessment of risks, we are somewhat less sanguine
that the Swiss economy has already adapted to the appreciation that followed the exit from
the exchange rate floor. We still observe slack in the labor market and some underutilization
of capital. Further, the effect of the appreciation on exports was more severe in nominal
terms, which is reflected in compressed profit margins. The results of the SNB’s regional
network survey cited in Annex VII of the staff report attest to this.
Fiscal Policy
The debt brake rule has made an important contribution to the sound financial position of the
central government by limiting expenditure to the level of estimated structural revenue. In
our view, this helps explain why the Swiss economy has weathered the global financial crisis
well and has maintained a strong fiscal position. General government debt stands at
46 percent of GDP, and sound public finances prevail at all levels of government. As
mentioned in the staff report, the goal of a balanced structural budget at the federal level has
been exceeded in the past, and the resulting structural surpluses have led to a nominal debt
reduction. The authorities expect a further moderate reduction in the future, as expenditures
generally remain below the budgeted amounts.
However, in contrast with staff, we do not see a need to adapt the fiscal rule in order to allow
for higher public spending. The domestic-oriented economy is performing well and fiscal
policy is not suitable to address an overvalued currency. Therefore, the fiscal stance is
considered adequate in the current situation. A further reduction in debt levels will also help
increase Switzerland’s resilience to external shocks. Moreover, as noted in the staff report,
population aging will put pressure on the fiscal position over the longer term.
In this context, we agree that fiscal reforms, notably in the area of old age pensions, are
necessary to maintain favorable economic conditions and a sustainable social safety net.

2
Monetary Policy
We agree with staff that monetary policy needs to remain accommodative to stabilize price
developments and support economic activity. Further, we share staff’s assessment that the
Swiss franc is overvalued. Under the current circumstances, we do not consider a rebalancing
of the SNB’s policy tools to be necessary. We would like to emphasize that the marginal rate
is essential for the effectiveness of the negative interest rate policy, as it is the main
determinant of market rates. We view the current activity in foreign exchange markets as
efficient and effective in mitigating appreciation pressures.
We acknowledge that the Swiss franc’s role as a safe haven currency influences monetary
policy but would not go so far as to say that it constrains policy independence. While
temporary adverse spillover effects to inflation cannot be completely offset, spillover effects
have often proved to be short lived and have not typically offset the SNB’s policy of
stabilizing inflation in the medium term. If needed, room is available to ease the monetary
stance further to ensure price stability in Switzerland in the medium term. In terms of the
SNB’s balance sheet, there are no immediate constraints. We agree with staff that as the
balance sheet expands, the risk of valuation losses increases. However, taking a longer-term
perspective, we view the potential for sustained losses as limited. At a more general level, it
should be recalled that the objective of a central bank is not to generate profits (or avoid
losses), but to fulfil its mandate, in particular ensuring price stability.
Financial Sector Policies
The authorities concur with staff that the stricter requirements for G-SIBs under the revised
too-big-to-fail regulations (TBTF2) are appropriate. They share staff’s assessment that the
size of the large banks relative to the Swiss economy and their systemic importance warrants
capital and leverage ratio requirements that are more stringent than international minimum
standards. They also agree that attention should be given to model-based risk-weighted assets
(RWA) and that improvements in RWA transparency are needed at the international level in
order to strengthen the credibility of risk weights. The authorities are of the opinion that the
Basel Committee’s reforms to risk-weighted capital requirements are key to reduce the
excessive variability in the banks' RWA and should not be diluted or delayed.
The authorities share staff’s risk assessment regarding developments in the domestic
mortgage and real estate markets. While the macroprudential measures introduced between
2012 and 2014 have produced a positive effect, risks remain. The authorities will continue to
monitor developments on the mortgage and real estate markets closely. They agree that,
should the momentum pick up again, additional macroprudential measures may become
necessary, particularly in the build-to-let segment. The authorities also agree with staff that
real estate exposures of insurance companies must be closely monitored. It should, however,
be pointed out that the total market share of the insurance sector in mortgage lending remains

3
very small compared to the banking sector. Furthermore, the direct real estate holdings of
insurance companies have not increased in recent years.
External Assessment
We welcome the analysis of the factors underlying Switzerland's current account surplus.
Several specific factors are important to understand the level and movement of the Swiss
current account, including Switzerland’s low inflation, which boosts its net nominal income
flows; the treatment of retained earnings of multinational corporations; and various
nontraditional flows such as merchanting activities. It should be noted that other factors, such
as demographic change, as well as past R&D activity in the pharmaceutical and chemical
industries, also play an important role.
