MEXICO
Staff Report for the 2004 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representative for the 2004 Consultation with Mexico
Approved by Caroline Atkinson and G. Russell Kincaid
September 24, 2004

Discussions for the 2004 Article IV consultation with Mexico took place in Mexico City during
June 21–July 1, 2004. The staff team comprised G. Meredith (Head), E. Faal, V. Moissinac (all
WHD); A.Bulir (PDR); and M.Vera Martin (ICM). Ms. Atkinson joined the mission for the final
discussions, and Mr. Schwartz (Alternate to the Executive Director) also participated. Discussions
were held with Finance Secretary Gil Diaz; Bank of Mexico Governor Ortiz and other members of
the Policy Board; officials from the Ministry of Finance, the Bank of Mexico, the Ministry of
Economy, the Ministry of Social Services; and supervisors of financial institutions. The team also
met with the Mexican Stock Exchange, financial institutions and credit rating agencies, and political
analysts.
The 2003 Article IV consultation was concluded on October 15, 2003, and the Staff Report was
issued as IMF Country Report No. 04/250 on August 13, 2004. In concluding the consultation,
Directors commended the authorities for policies that continued to underpin macroeconomic
stability and investor confidence. Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to further fiscal
consolidation and endorsed their medium-term fiscal goals, which call for further fiscal adjustment
to lower ratios of public debt to GDP. Directors stressed the need to reinvigorate the structural
reform agenda, where recent progress had been disappointing owing to difficulties in forging the
needed political consensus.
Mexico has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, sections 2, 3, and 4, and does not have
restrictions on payments for current international transactions (Appendix I).
Comprehensive economic data are available for Mexico on a timely basis, and are adequate to
conduct surveillance. Mexico has subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standard, and its
metadata are posted on the Fund’s Data Standards Bulletin Board. The data module of the ROSC for
Mexico was completed in May 2003 and published as IMF Country Report No. 03/150.

I. OVERVIEW AND KEY ISSUES
1.
Mexico is experiencing a broad-based economic recovery following three years of
weak activity (Text Table 1). Both private and official growth estimates for 2004 have risen
steadily since the beginning of the year to stand at around 4 percent by mid-year. The pick up in
activity has been associated with the U.S. economic recovery, and in particular the impact on
Mexican exports of the strong upturn in U.S. manufacturing activity beginning in the second half
of 2003. In addition, growth in Mexican final domestic demand has accelerated to 4 percent in
the first half of 2004 over the same period in 2003. Along with a continuing expansion of private
consumption and residential construction, activity has been boosted by a recovery in business
fixed investment, following a decline of 15 percent from the peak in 2000 through 2003.

2.
While the near-term growth outlook is favorable, important policy challenges
remain. Political fragmentation since congressional elections in July 2003 has blocked
legislative initiatives, and most observers believe it unlikely that major actions will be possible
before the 2006 elections. Absent further progress on structural reforms, prospects for robust
economic growth beyond 2004 have become less favorable. In the fiscal area, markets have been
reassured by the government’s ability to meet its objectives for the traditional deficit, despite
spending pressures, and the public debt structure has been strengthened further. Yet the spending
of “windfall” oil revenues in recent years has made the fiscal position more vulnerable to a
decline in oil prices. Even if oil prices do not decline sharply, significant spending compression
will be needed to meet medium-term budget targets in the absence of tax measures that would
boost non-oil revenues. Public debt edged up in 2003, largely reflecting exchange rate
depreciation, leaving gross public debt at around 51 percent of GDP compared with 47¾ percent
in 2001.
3.
Inflation has been brought down to the low single-digit range. More recently,
however, headline inflation has risen above the upper bound of the Bank of Mexico’s (BOM)

-5-

2–4 percent “variability interval.” While supply shocks have played an important role in
boosting headline inflation, core inflation has been resistant to further declines, stabilizing in a
range around 3½ percent, while expectations of headline inflation over the next 12 months have
edged up to over 4 percent. The main challenge is to maintain the credibility of the BOM’s
commitment to reducing inflation to 3 percent, while not choking off the nascent recovery.
4.
The Fund’s policy advice to Mexico has focused on the need to consolidate further
the broad fiscal position, lower inflation to the medium-term target, advance structural
and financial reforms, and promote measures to crisis-proof the economy. Progress in
several of these areas has been impressive, notably in lowering inflation, modernizing the
financial system, allowing the exchange rate to float freely, meeting targets for the traditional
fiscal deficit, and strengthening the structure of public debt. Mexico has participated in an FSAP,
and was the first major emerging market country to issue bonds with collective action clauses
(CACs) in 2003. On the other hand, after successes in the latter half of the 1990s, recent progress
in fiscal consolidation is mostly due to higher oil prices, and structural reforms have been limited
(Box 1).The authorities broadly share the Fund’s views on the priorities in these areas, but
political constraints have hindered passage of necessary legislation, as it has been difficult to
channel the longer-term benefits of these policies into broad popular support.
5.

Against this background, the 2004 consultation focused on the following issues:

•

Fiscal policy. Success in meeting deficit targets has recently been aided by windfall oil
revenues. Moving ahead, staff emphasized the need to save a significant portion of future
windfalls to avoid increasing dependence of the budget on oil revenues. The authorities
agreed, but noted the political difficulties in resisting spending pressures when revenues
were strong—at the same time, they underscored Mexico’s demonstrated ability to cut
spending if needed to meet deficit targets. Staff observed that, even if oil prices did not
fall sharply, meeting medium-term fiscal targets would be challenging without measures
to boost non-oil revenues. The authorities agreed that, in such a case, significant further
spending restraint would be needed.

•

Monetary policy. Staff noted that monetary conditions remained relatively easy, due in
part to peso weakness, and agreed with the authorities that, with headline inflation
remaining above the BOM’s target, tightening would be appropriate. The magnitude and
timing, however, would depend on an ongoing assessment of the impact of supply shocks
on underlying inflationary pressures, and also that of external monetary actions on
domestic markets. Staff noted the problems in communicating policies when inflation
was above target, and suggested that publication of an official inflation forecast could
help in this regard. The BOM observed that further refinements to the inflation targeting
framework would be considered in due course. It was premature, however, to consider
publishing an inflation forecast, particularly given the indirect relationship between
existing monetary instruments and market conditions, as well as uncertainties about the
inflation outlook.

Box 1. Mexico: The Administration’s Structural Reform Agenda, 2002–061
1. Energy sector reform aimed to increase the efficiency of public producers and allow broader private sector
participation. The latter is needed both to acquire needed expertise, as well as to expand capital investment. The
constitution, however, bars most private-sector participation in this sector.
Status: The government has taken incremental steps to expand private participation. In 2002, PEMEX
introduced multiple service contracts, which allow private firms some operational responsibilities in gas fields.
While a limited degree of private investment is allowed in electricity generation, only state companies can
distribute power. No changes have occurred in the oil sector. At this stage, constitutional changes in the energy
area appear highly unlikely, and the administration is focusing on establishing legal certainty for the
agreements already in place.
2. Labor market reform aimed to increase productivity and employment in the formal sector by reducing
rigidities. The objectives of the reform were to: lower sizable nonwage and dismissal costs; make work hours
and probation periods more flexible; and improve union governance.
Status: A reform was submitted to congress in 2002 based on a consensus between employers, unions, and the
Labor Secretariat. In any case, it did not address major rigidities to hiring in Mexico, notably high nonwage and
dismissal costs. The authorities still envisage a reform that would allow for, inter alia, more flexible work
arrangements, and would facilitate the transfer of workers from the informal to the formal sector. Observers
believe, however, that the current proposal may be too watered down to meaningfully increase flexibility.
3. Telecommunications reform was intended to: increase coverage and quality of services; lower costs; promote
a competitive environment; and encourage new technologies and services. Telmex controls 96 percent of the
fixed-line network and its sister company, Telcel, controls 80 percent of the mobile market. Internet penetration
is limited by a lack of fixed-line capacity.
Status: The government and a congressional commission began working on a bill in 2002 that would
strengthen regulatory authority; spectrum planning and administration; concessions and permits; satellite
services; dominant carrier regulation; consumer protection; and fines. No significant progress has been made,
however. In late 2003, the government announced plans to give COFETEL greater regulatory powers to boost
competition. In March 2004 the WTO ruled that Telmex’s sole authority to set domestic connection charges
breached its obligations under the WTO services agreement.
4. Financial market reform aimed to promote savings, modernize the financial system to reactivate bank
lending, deepen capital markets, and modernize development banks.
Status: Congress passed several measures designed to achieve the authorities’ objectives, including legislation
on credit guarantees, bank supervision, and the payments system. The closure of government banks and the sale
of government shares in private banks has reduced government participation in the sector.Foreign ownership of
banks and nonbank financial intermeidation have increased significantly, and oversight of banks has
strengthened.
5. Judical reform aimed to strengthen governance by improving the quality of public administration through
improving the legal and regulatory framework, reducing corruption, and increasing the accountability of civil
servants.
Status: A number of initiatives have been sent to congress, and a law enabling public access to government
information was approved in April 2002. Legislation improving corporate governance and protecting minority
shareholder rights has also been enacted. In 2003, legislation protecting creditor rights was approved.

•

Structural reforms. Discussions focused on: the prospects for reviving the reform
agenda; smaller-scale reforms that might be politically feasible and/or did not require
legislation; and the effects of a lack of reforms on the medium-term outlook. The
authorities were optimistic that tax and pension reforms proposed by the National Fiscal
Convention had a greater chance of success than previous initiatives; the passage of fiscal
responsibility legislation was also possible in the fall session of congress. In contrast,
there was no public consensus for further reforms in the energy sector. Staff noted that
liberalization of the telecommunications sector could have a catalytic effect on growth; it
could also be accomplished by executive action as opposed to legislation.

•

Competitiveness. Discussions focused on concerns about a possible loss of
competitiveness in U.S. markets. The authorities pointed to several industry-specific
factors that explained the stagnation of Mexico’s market share in recent years, and saw
the recent recovery in the maquiladora sector as a sign of renewed confidence in
Mexico’s prospects. There was general agreement, however, that Mexico would need to
take active measures to keep pace with other fast-growing emerging market countries in
export markets.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

6.
Economic activity started picking up in late 2003 (Figure 1; Table 1). Following real
GDP growth of only 1.3 percent in 2003, growth accelerated to 3.8 percent in the first half of
2004 over the previous year. This recovery is partly attributable to strengthening U.S. industrial
production, as reflected in growth in Mexican manufactured exports of 10½ percent in the first
seven months of 2004 over the same period in 2003. Consumption growth has also increased in
response to lower interest rates and rising credit availability. Spurred by the recovery in exports
and strong domestic sales, business investment began to pick up in late 2003, with gross private
fixed investment rising by 5½ percent in the first half of 2004 over the previous year.
7.
The broad-based recovery has led to rising capacity utilization and higher
employment. Capacity utilization in manufacturing has recovered above mid-2001 levels, while
the staff’s estimate of the output gap has narrowed to slightly below 2 percent of GDP.1 Formal
employment in the private sector increased by 185,000 in the first half of 2004, reaching its
highest level since mid-2001; most of the increase is accounted for by permanent employment.
The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate edged down to 3.7 percent in July after peaking at
3.9 percent in February.

The staff’s methodology for constructing the output gap is discussed in an accompanying selected issues
paper.

Headline CPI inflation reached a record low of just under 4 percent at end-2003
(12-month basis), but rose above the BOM’s variability interval of 2–4 percent in early
2004 (Figure 2). Inflation has been boosted by supply shocks, including a temporary suspension
of some meat imports from the United States, as well as increases in administered prices. As a
result, the headline measure rose to 4.8 percent in August (12-month basis). Core inflation was
lower, at 3.7 percent, but has shown no signs of decelerating since early 2003. Inflation
expectations for the next 12 months stood at 4.1 percent in August. Contractual wage settlements
averaged 4.5 percent in the first eight months of 2004, broadly unchanged from the second half
of 2003.
9.
The BOM has tightened policy five times since the beginning of 2004 via increases in
the corto (the borrowed reserves objective) (Figure 2). In addition, domestic market conditions
have been affected by two increases in the U.S. federal funds target rate. Starting in May—

January to just over 10½ percent in
September.
10.
Nevertheless, monetary conditions remain relatively easy, due in part to weakness in
the peso (Figures 2 and 3). After falling by 7½ percent against the U.S. dollar through 2003, the
peso depreciated by a further 3 percent through mid-September, partly reflecting concerns about
the effects of U.S. monetary tightening on emerging markets. The real effective exchange rate
depreciated by 13 percent through 2003, and a further 1 percent in the first seven months of
2004. The weakness of the peso in 2003, combined with a drop in real short-term interest rates
through the year of about 2½ percentage points, led to a significant easing in monetary
conditions. Part of this easing has been reversed by rising interest rates in 2004, but monetary
conditions remain substantially more accommodative than at the beginning of 2003.

Fiscal consolidation was modest in 2003, despite higher-than-budgeted oil prices
(Figure 4 and Table 2). The augmented deficit fell slightly to 3 percent of GDP from 3¼ percent
in 2002, primarily because of lower off-budget financing requirements arising from falling
interest rates.2 The traditional deficit, at ½ percent of GDP, was broadly in line with the 2003
budget target and the 2002 outturn.3 Windfall gains from higher oil revenues and public
enterprise profits were used to offset shortfalls in non-oil tax revenues and finance higher-thanbudgeted capital outlays, wages, severance payments, and interest charges. As a result, the nonoil augmented deficit deteriorated further, reaching 9½ percent of GDP in 2003 compared with
8 percent in 2002. A small contribution of 0.1 percent of GDP was made to the Oil Stabilization
Fund (OSF). In the first seven months of 2004, higher oil prices led to total revenue growth of
9 percent over the same period in 2003, while overall spending grew by 7 percent.
Programmable current spending also rose by 7 percent, compared with the budget assumption of
no nominal increase for the year as a whole.
12.
Public debt edged up further in 2003, but its structure continued to improve. The
ratio of gross augmented public debt to GDP rose by 1¼ percentage point in 2003 to reach
51 percent, largely due to peso depreciation. The authorities have already completed their
external financing program for 2004 on favorable terms. Several liability management
operations, including an exchange of global bonds in early 2004, have helped to improve the
efficiency of the yield curve. Domestic public debt management has concentrated on extending
maturities, improving the liquidity of benchmark issues, and deepening domestic financial
markets.4
13.
In July, banks and the government agreed on the exchange of FOBAPROA debt for
new bonds, ending a long period of uncertainty for the financial system. FOBAPROA notes
were issued to banks after the 1994–95 financial crisis, but the government’s ultimate liability
remained in dispute as their maturity approached in 2005–06. Of the original gross amount of
about 3¼ percent of GDP, it is tentatively estimated that banks will receive about 1½ percent of
GDP in new bonds issued by the deposit insurance agency (IPAB), with the difference reflecting
recovered loans, loss sharing covered by banks, and related credits banks will pay.

2

The augmented deficit is defined as the public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) less nonrecurring
revenues. The differences between the augmented and traditional deficits reflect: off balance sheet public
investment projects (PIDIREGAS); servicing costs of off balance sheet public debt related to bank and
toll road restructuring; the financing needs of government development banks; and the exclusion of nonrecurring revenues from the augmented measure (these factors are quantified in Table 2).

3

The 2002 outturn is adjusted for exceptional transfers related to the closure of Banrural. These transfers
did not affect augmented public debt, as they were offset by an equal reduction in development banks’
financing needs.

The structure of Mexico’s public debt is analyzed in an accompanying selected issues paper.

Indicators of external vulnerability remain favorable. The current account deficit
narrowed to 1½ percent of GDP in 2003, and was more than matched by FDI inflows (Figure 5;
Tables 3 and 4). Net international reserves rose to US$58.2 billion at end-July 2004 from
US$48 billion at end-2002, reflecting strong PEMEX receipts. Gross reserves at end-August are
estimated at 170 percent of short-term external debt by residual maturity. After a short-lived
spike to 250 basis points in mid-May as U.S. interest rates rose, Mexico’s EMBI+ spread had
fallen back below 200 basis points by end-August.
15.
Larger corporates have taken steps to improve their debt structure by issuing pesodenominated fixed-rate debt in local capital markets. Small- and medium-sized firms
continue to face difficulties in obtaining bank credit and market financing, while large
companies in good financial health (mainly exporters) have relatively easy financing conditions.
While there have been bond defaults and financial difficulties in a few enterprises, the authorities
and market participants attribute these to problems in individual firms as opposed to systemic
factors.
16.
The authorities modified the mechanism for auctioning international reserves in
March 2004. The BOM continues to pre-announce the amount of dollars to be sold in the
market, equal to 50 percent of net reserve accumulation in the previous 3-month period. The
sales will now, however, be spread over the following 12 months, as opposed to 3 months, to
reduce volatility in the foreign exchange market.
III. ECONOMIC OUTLOOK
17.
The staff growth projection for 2004 has been revised up to 4 percent from
3½ percent in the April WEO.5 Economic recovery is expected to continue in the second half
of the year, albeit at a more moderate pace than in the first half. Although U.S. forecasts have
edged down recently, most still call for growth of around 4¼ percent this year. Recent domestic
indicators, notably for exports, industrial production, and employment, also point to continued
expansion. The impact of higher interest rates on spending is expected to be modest given
improved corporate balance sheets and increasing credit availability to households and
businesses, while exporters will continue to benefit from the past weakening in the peso.

The consensus forecast released in August was also 4 percent.

Staff believes that the risks to near-term growth are roughly balanced. Given the low
starting point for business investment, a sustained increase in private-sector confidence could
well lead to a more powerful rebound than the 5 percent private fixed investment growth
currently projected. On the external side, the recent turnaround in the maquiladora sector could
signal a reversal of Mexico’s loss of U.S. market share, reflecting both the recovery in U.S.
industrial production and the weakness of the peso versus the dollar. On the downside, a
continuing political stalemate could dampen confidence. In addition, recent U.S. indicators have
been mixed, and Mexico would be particularly vulnerable to a renewed downturn in U.S.
manufacturing activity. The balance of risks to the near-term inflation outlook could be slightly
on the upside given the trends in the recent data, although it is too early to judge the full impact
of monetary tightening on actual and expected inflation.
20.
Medium-term growth prospects are clouded by the stalled reform process. Staff has
revised down its baseline projection for GDP growth over the 2005–09 period to an annual
average of slightly over 3 percent, assuming the absence of significant reforms (Text Table 2).
Even this performance is estimated to require trend total factor productivity growth of about
½ percent per year, above the average pace since 1980, but below that in the 1960s and 1970s
(Box 2). Staff has also constructed a more optimistic scenario in which medium-term growth
averages 4½ percent, and a downside scenario with growth of slightly over 2 percent. In
discussing these projections with the authorities, staff acknowledged the considerable
uncertainty attached to any such calculations. Estimates of both output gaps and potential growth
were

Box 2. Mexico: Productivity, Potential Output, and Medium-Term Growth
Mexico has experienced sharply different growth episodes since 1960, with GDP increasing at an average rate of
6½ percent during 1960–79, falling to only 2½ percent during 1980–2003. This raises the question of the factors
underlying historical GDP growth in Mexico, and the implications looking ahead. We use an aggregate production
function to decompose growth into its cyclical and trend components, and explore alternative medium-term growth
scenarios (the analysis is described in more detail in an accompanying selected issues paper).
A. Growth Accounting
The growth accounting exercise is performed over the 1960–2003 period, assuming a Cobb-Douglas production
function with shares of labor and capital of 67 and 33 percent respectively. Capital is derived from national accounts
data on gross private investment using the perpetual inventory method, with an assumed depreciation rate of
10 percent. The labor input is defined as the economically

B. Medium-Term Projections
Our medium-term projections assume that growth in the capital stock is consistent with keeping the capital-output
ratio constant at 1.5. As a result, the capital contribution is higher as we move from a low to a higher growth scenario
because more investment is needed to maintain the fixed capital-ratio with faster growth. The labor force grows by
2.4 percent, and baseline trend TFP growth is assumed to be 0.3 percent. The latter is above the average pace since
1980, but below that in the 1960s and 1970s. It is also below the 0.7 percent rate experienced in 1996-2003, based on

IV. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A.

Fiscal Policy

21.
The authorities reiterated their commitment to achieving deficit targets, noting that
success in this area had underpinned policy credibility. Deficits based on the traditional
definition had been kept close to the 2002 PRONAFIDE targets in recent years, despite political
pressures for greater spending.6 For 2004, the budget figure of 0.3 percent of GDP for the
traditional deficit remained realistic, as possible shortfalls in non-oil revenues and spending
overruns would be more than offset by high oil revenues. Indeed, they felt it would be possible
to save some of the latter in the form of a transfer to the OSF. The authorities noted that
spending beyond budget estimates in 2003 (and probably again in 2004) resulted largely from
adjusters that allocated windfall oil revenues to public capital spending, or covered increased
costs in the public sector associated with higher energy prices.7 Thus, spending in these areas
would automatically compress if oil prices were to fall.
22.
Staff agreed that the authorities had established a strong reputation for fiscal
prudence as a result of the sustained achievement of deficit targets. Concern was expressed,
however, about the role that high oil revenues had played in meeting these targets in recent years
in the face of non-oil revenue shortfalls and spending overruns. In the event, little of the excess
oil revenues would be saved in the medium term, which appeared to contradict the spirit of the
budget adjusters as originally envisaged. However, updated information shows that the
authorities expect substantially higher savings of excess oil revenues in 2004 than suggested by
the staff estimates, part of which will finance later investment spending (Text Table 3).8 While
higher spending was partly due to the operation of the adjusters and higher energy costs,
overruns in current spending exceeded the amounts attributable to these factors. Staff observed
that the budget figures exhibited a pattern of overestimating non-oil revenues, while
underestimating nondiscretionary expenditures. This provided room for congress to include more
programmable spending in the budget, even with a low oil price assumption—excess oil
revenues could then be used, in effect, to finance programmable spending. Due to spending of
excess oil revenues, the fiscal impulse in 2004 was expected to be slightly stimulative, implying
a pro-cyclical stance given the recovery underway.
23.
Staff emphasized the need for a framework that would promote greater mediumterm savings of excess oil revenues. This was needed for three reasons: to avoid inefficient
6

PRONAFIDE stands for Programa Nacional de Financiamiento de Desarollo, which is the fiscal
framework associated with the government’s medium-term development plan.
7

The 2004 budget law specifies that PEMEX be returned the tax it pays on excess oil export revenues
(the authorities thought that much of this rebate should be considered fiscal saving for 2004, as it would
be held to meet financing needs in 2005). Remaining excess oil revenues would then be used to finance
overruns in nonprogrammable spending and shortfalls in non-oil revenues. Any remaining excess oil
revenue would then be divided equally between transfers to states and fiscal savings (via transfers to the
OSF and debt reduction).

See Chapter II of IMF Country Report No. 04/250 for a discussion of the adjusters.

- 20 -

spending at times of high world oil prices; to reduce fiscal dislocations that could result from a
drop in oil prices; and to take advantage of favorable conditions to reduce public debt. Staff
recommended incorporating an objective assumption for oil prices in the budget (for instance,
based on futures markets), and explicitly earmarking a significant portion (at least one half) of
the difference between the oil revenues associated with this price and an assumed long-term
price for saving—preferably in the form of a lower traditional deficit, given the attention paid to
this concept. Deviations through the year between actual and assumed prices would then be
subject to the same savings rule (possibly via transfers to/from the OSF). Such a framework
would have two advantages. Firstly, explicitly incorporating saving of excess oil revenues in the
target for the traditional deficit could increase the political commitment to achieving these
savings. Secondly, the savings would take precedence over other fiscal developments through
the year, such as higher spending or shortfalls in non-oil revenues. The authorities, in contrast,
felt that the tending toward a conservative oil price assumption still played a useful role in
containing spending pressures, and thus was more likely to deliver the desired fiscal restraint.
They also did not believe that a different mechanism of adjusters would offset political pressures
to spend excess revenues. They agreed, however, that the operation of the adjusters had left only
modest scope for saving oil revenues. Looking ahead, they were hopeful that the OSF would
accumulate a meaningful surplus if oil prices remain high.

The mission welcomed the revision to the authorities’ medium-term fiscal
framework in the 2004 budget, and their intention to update it in the 2005 exercise
(Box 3).9 Staff observed that meeting the objective for the augmented deficit of about 1½ percent

These updates to the medium-term framework are discussed in an accompanying selected issues paper.

Box 3. Mexico: Medium-Term Fiscal Scenarios
The 2004 budget updated for the first time the
authorities’ medium-term fiscal framework, and it was
revised again in the draft budget for 2005. The original
version, presented in the 2002 PRONAFIDE, linked the pace
of fiscal adjustment during 2002–06 to progress in structural
reforms. With only modest reforms, the augmented deficit
was to fall from 4 percent of GDP in 2002 to 1.6 percent in
2006, bringing down net public debt by 2 percentage points
to 41½ percent of GDP. This program has gone off-track,
however, as the augmented deficit is expected to reach
3.1 percent of GDP in 2004 vs. 2½ percent of GDP in
PRONAFIDE. Public debt edged up through 2003, as a
result of the higher deficit, low growth, and peso
depreciation.
The latest framework maintains the original deficit
targets for 2006, while underscoring the need for fiscal
reforms. The adjustment effort is now concentrated in 2005–
06, however. The traditional balance improves by ½ percent
of GDP over these years, and off-budget financing is
projected to fall by 1 percent of GDP. Based on a strong
growth outlook (average GDP growth of 4.1 percent in
2005–08) but a low oil price assumption (US$20.8 per barrel
for the Mexico mix), tax reform is seen as necessary to meet
these objectives. The scope for spending reductions is
limited; new pressures for social spending are foreseen
(estimated by staff at 1½–2 percent of GDP); and the
government is expected to service the debt of rising
PIDIREGAS projects upon completion. In addition, the
framework emphasizes the need for pension reform to prevent
the pension bill from spiraling out of control after 2008. In
staff’s view, the framework’s reliance on reducing off-budget
financing to lower the augmented deficit is problematic. The
projection assumes financing only of existing PIDIREGAS
projects, whereas a continued stream of new projects appears
more likely.

The staff’s baseline fiscal scenario is based on the
2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008
authorities’ commitment to meeting targets for the
traditional balance. It assumes higher oil prices (averaging
$29.7 per barrel in 2005–08) and lower growth. The augmented deficit remains above the authorities’ target,
however, as off-budget financing is compressed by less. The decline in augmented public debt is also slower than in
the authorities’ plan. Higher oil prices would lessen the need for spending cuts, but the underlying adjustment during
2005–07, at 1½ percent of GDP, would still be substantial in an environment of rising spending pressures in the areas
of health, education, and pensions.

- 22 of GDP in 2007 would require an estimated 1¾ percent of GDP in net consolidation measures,
assuming a mild easing in world oil prices.10 This would be particularly challenging in the
absence of tax reforms that would raise new revenues, and in the face of medium-term spending
pressures in the areas of health, education, and pensions. The authorities agreed that important
fiscal challenges lay ahead. Tax reform remained on the agenda, although, even if passed, it
might not raise significant new revenues at the federal level.11 This underscored the need to
continue efforts to raise the yield from the existing tax structure, implement pension reform, and
compress spending in noncritical areas.12 They noted that Mexico had a track record of cutting
spending when required to meet deficit targets, and that this option remained available. Staff
agreed that spending compression had allowed past budget targets to be met, but noted that the
last instance of significant cuts was in 1998. The authorities argued that, notwithstanding the
changing political environment, there remained a strong consensus for prudent policies in
Mexico.
25.
Staff expressed concern about the possibility of “drift” in updating medium-term
fiscal plans—in particular, the risk that objectives could be pushed off into the future. In
this context, updates to the 2002 PRONAFIDE had postponed objectives for the augmented
deficit, in spite of the assumption of higher oil prices. The recent increases in public debt ratios
since 2001 also stood in contrast to the downward paths envisaged in the original PRONAFIDE.
Staff reiterated the view that a gross public debt ratio of about 50 percent of GDP was
uncomfortably high for a country still in the process of establishing full policy credibility. The
staff’s debt sustainability analysis indicates that the ratio of augmented debt to GDP would fall
under the baseline scenario of further fiscal consolidation, but would remain near current levels
if the augmented deficit is not reduced over time (Annex IV). A combination of adverse shocks
could result in a rising debt ratio under a pessimistic scenario. The authorities emphasized that
public debt ratios had risen because of temporary shocks, and were still expected to decline this
year and beyond. They maintained that concerns about the level of gross debt did not take into
account the strengthening of the debt structure, and Mexico’s overall financial stability and
market credibility.
26.
Subsequent to the policy discussions, the authorities presented a draft budget for
2005 to congress in early September, along with estimates of the 2004 outturn. Market

10

Staff projects a decline in the price of the Mexico mix in line with futures prices.

11

A reform plan that has been widely discussed would lower the general VAT rate from 15 to 12 percent,
introduce a 4 percent rate on food (previously untaxed), and allow states to levy a 3 percent consumption
tax. “Static” estimates suggest that this plan would be roughly revenue-neutral at the federal level.
12

The authorities estimate that the pension system has a deficit in net present value terms of 116 percent
of 2003 GDP. A step toward reform was taken in August 2004 in the form of a bill that reduces pension
and other benefits for new employees at the social security institute (IMSS). Because it applies only to
new workers, however, it will take some time for the benefits to be felt.

- 23 reaction was generally favorable—the traditional deficit would fall slightly to 0.1 percent of
GDP in 2005 from 0.3 percent in 2004 (excluding payments for the voluntary retirement plan),
while the augmented deficit would drop by about 1 percentage point to 2.2 percent of GDP
(Table 2).13
The budget is predicated on a decline in oil prices for the Mexican mix to $23 per barrel next
year, and real GDP growth of 3.8 percent—these compare with staff assumptions based on
futures market prices in early September, and GDP growth of 3.2 percent. With oil revenues
falling, the budget assumes a sharp drop in programmable current spending to achieve the deficit
target. Staff welcomes the commitment to fiscal discipline reflected in the budget targets, and in
particular the projected decline in the augmented balance, while noting that they would be
challenging to meet, even if oil prices do not fall sharply. The staff projection for 2005, based on
oil prices remaining near current levels, assumes across-the-board spending restraint that reduces
programmable spending by ½ percent of GDP to achieve an outturn for the augmented balance
of 2.6 percent of GDP. Congress is scheduled to pass a final budget law by November 15.
27.
The authorities anticipated that fiscal responsibility legislation would be advanced
in the next session of congress. It could include provisions that spending initiatives be matched
by revenue measures, and that the budget (traditional definition) be balanced over the business
cycle. They were also hopeful that the proposals of the National Fiscal Convention for pension
and tax reform would allow progress in these areas. The mission encouraged these steps, while
noting that it would be desirable to emphasize augmented measures of the budget position in
fiscal responsibility principles. These measures were more relevant from the point of view of
financial stability and debt sustainability; focusing on augmented measures would also avoid any
incentive to transfer fiscal activity to off-balance-sheet areas.
28.
Staff expressed the view that limited government control over the operations of
some public enterprises, including PEMEX, undermined efficiency and added uncertainty
to the fiscal situation. PEMEX’s costs exceeded those of other major international oil
companies, partly due to rigid labor contracts, generous pay scales, and inefficiencies in
operations. The authorities agreed that further efforts were needed to strengthen corporate
governance in public enterprises and bring labor compensation in line with market conditions.
Pension reform was also needed to ensure the solvency of public enterprises. The mission
welcomed the establishment of an independent audit committee for PEMEX, which should allow
for a more transparent monitoring of its financial performance.
29.
Subnational government debt in Mexico has increased since the early 1990s, but still
represents less than 2 percent of GDP.14 While the federal government has taken steps to

The projection for 2004 in Table 2 is a staff estimate based on data for the first seven months of the
year, and implies somewhat higher levels of revenue and spending than the assumed outturn in the draft
budget, but the same deficit figure. The authorities now project a somewhat lower augmented deficit,
reflecting higher 2004 savings of excess oil revenues.

promote fiscal prudence at the subnational level since the bailouts of the mid-1990s, rigidities in
state finances still make it difficult for them to absorb shocks. Own revenues of most states are
less than 10 percent of total revenues, with the rest mostly reflecting federal transfers. Staff
noted the importance of maintaining tight controls on the borrowing of subnational entities,
particularly given the risk associated with any perception that the federal government would bail
out state governments. The authorities agreed, but noted that such bailouts were proscribed by
the current framework, and that the role of market-based evaluations of state creditworthiness
has strengthened significantly since 2000.
B.

Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy

30.
The challenge for monetary policy has been to complete the process of bringing
inflation down to the 3 percent target. The authorities attributed the rise in headline inflation
in the first half of 2004 primarily to price shocks, notably to increases in commodity, meat, and
administered prices. Demand pressures did not appear to be a contributing factor, although this
situation would require careful monitoring given possible declines in economic slack if growth
remained strong. They noted that core services inflation, which primarily reflected domestic
costs, had continued to fall.
31.
Staff generally agreed with this assessment, while observing that price shocks could
prove persistent, especially given pressures in global commodity markets. The central
question was how long the BOM could allow headline inflation to remain above the variability
interval without endangering policy credibility—a risk that was heightened by signs of rising
inflation expectations. Staff noted that monetary conditions remained relatively easy through the
first half of the year, in spite of increases in the corto. Against this background, staff and the
authorities agreed that some further tightening in monetary conditions would likely be needed,
with the main issue being its source, pace, and timing. Staff questioned if the gradual rise in U.S.
interest rates expected in markets would have a sufficient impact on Mexico to forestall
inflationary risks. BOM officials pointed to recent policy statements, which indicated that
domestic market conditions should reflect “at least” the degree of tightening expected in U.S.
policy. Subsequent to the discussions, the domestic overnight rate rose in line with the two
increases in the U.S. fed funds target rate, and also when the BOM increased the corto in late
July and late August.
32.
BOM officials noted that press statements on policy had been streamlined and
shortened starting in May to signal BOM views more clearly to markets. Staff observed that
conditions in domestic money markets also had become more stable since May, and that the
overnight interest rate had moved more systematically in response to domestic and U.S. policy
actions. On the issue of formally shifting from the corto to an interest rate as an operating
instrument, the authorities observed that it was difficult to identify the size of the interest rate
channel given volatility in the historical data and the changing structure of the financial system.

- 25 -

Until greater confidence was established in estimates of the effect of interest rates on activity and
inflation, it would be difficult to communicate the precise intent of policy actions using an
interest rate tool. Staff noted that some uncertainty about interest rate effects was inevitable, but
believed that policy transparency could be enhanced in the period ahead by moving in this
direction.
33.
The authorities acknowledged the difficulties in communicating what a
“continuous” inflation target of 3 percent meant with headline inflation running at over
4 percent. Increasing emphasis had been placed in policy statements on underlying inflation,
and on explaining the nature of price shocks. Staff suggested that publishing an inflation
forecast, as most other inflation-targeting central banks now were doing, could help to motivate
the policy stance and perhaps influence private inflation expectations. BOM officials agreed that
this approach had some merits, but noted disadvantages in the existing circumstances. Given
considerable uncertainty about future inflation, a forecast that turned out to be too low could
jeopardize the BOM’s credibility, while one that was too high could unduly delay the
disinflationary process through its effect on expectations.
34.
The authorities remain firmly committed to allowing the exchange rate to be
market-determined. They expressed the view that the peso depreciation since February was not
based on fundamentals, but rather reflected market uncertainty about the effects of U.S. policy
tightening. They saw no evidence of “Dutch disease” arising from high oil prices, as both
nominal and real exchange rates have depreciated over the past two years, and oil exports were
small in relation to GDP. Staff endorsed the transparent approach to exchange rate management,
noting that exchange rate volatility did not appear to be unduly complicating policy formation or
undermining macroeconomic performance.
35.
The authorities and staff agreed that the rules-based mechanism for accumulating
international reserves was consistent with a noninterventionist approach to reserves
management. The present level of reserves was adequate, both in terms of coverage of
short-term external debt and Mexico’s gross financing needs. The mission welcomed the
willingness to refine the mechanism in light of experience, as reflected in the lengthening of the
reserve sales period starting in March 2004.
C.

Financial Sector

36.
The authorities noted that the resilience of the financial system to shocks has
increased in recent years, and systemic problems are unlikely. Banks’ financial indicators are
sound, with adequate levels of profitability, loan provisions, and capital adequacy. The share of
bank intermediation in the financial system has been falling, however. Bank credit to consumers
has increased significantly, but business lending has stagnated in recent years. Nonbank
intermediaries have been particularly active in the mortgage sector, which is growing rapidly
(Box 4). The lack of dynamism in the banking sector was attributed in part to the existence of

- 26 -

Box 4. Mexico. Growing Role of Finance Companies in Financial Intermediation
Finance companies (the so-called SOFOLES) are playing an increasing role in the Mexican
financial system. While the share of commercial banks in the financial system has declined in recent
years, pension funds, insurance companies, and sofoles are becoming more important. Sofoles accounted
for 4 percent of total financial assets (about 2½ percent of GDP) in March 2004.

As of March 2004, most assets under management are concentrated in sofoles that are independent
of financial groups, and dedicated to mortgage financing. Most assets are held by independent sofoles
(66 percent of total assets), while 14 percent of assets are in the hands of sofoles affiliated with domestic
financial groups, and 20 percent within foreign groups, respectively. Mortgage lending accounts for
65 percent of total assets, followed by automobile credit (26 percent).
Sofoles are financed through bank loans, development funds, and bonds issued in local debt
markets. Loans from commercial banks and other institutions (mainly through the public mortgage
development bank Sociedad Hipotecaria Federal (SHF) represent 77 percent of total financing. These
sources are mostly captured by sofoles dedicated to mortgage lending and construction credit
(80 percent). Other sofoles—mainly dedicated to the automobile lending—have also benefited from
development of the local debt market, with outstanding bonds of MXN25 billion in 2004Q1.

action to force changes in banks’ behavior or fee structures was not appropriate, and that the
foundation was in place for a sound and sustained recovery in financial intermediation.

In the area of financial supervision, a prompt corrective action system has been put
in place to deal with banks in financial difficulty. Discussions on a resolution mechanism for
failed banks have not yet been concluded, however. The authorities emphasized the high priority
attached to strengthening oversight of nonbank institutions. They noted that there are no signs of
instability in the nonbank sector, but that rapid growth in recent years warrants close attention to
avoid inappropriate risk-taking. Staff observed that nonbank mortgage institutions were a
potential source of problems, as most of their funding was provided by the Sociedad Hipotecaria
Federal (SHF), and thus was not subject to market scrutiny; the SHF also guaranteed the
mortgages. More generally, staff expressed concern about the potential for hidden liabilities to
build up in the development banks, and suggested a review of their role and operations. The
authorities noted that the development banks were subject to supervisory oversight, and their
balance sheets were sound. Neither did they pose a drain on the operating budget of the federal
government. Nevertheless, a rationalization of the operations could be considered in light of the
changing financial environment.
D.

External Sector

38.
Concerns have eased about slow growth in exports and the edging down of Mexico’s
share in the U.S. market, as exports have accelerated significantly in 2004 (Figure 3 and
Box 5). The authorities believed that past losses of U.S. market share reflected factors specific to
the U.S. industrial sectors to which Mexican exports were directed, and were likely to be
transitory. In this context, they pointed to the recent upsurge of FDI in Mexico’s export
industries and signs of revival in the maquiladora sector. They underscored that Mexico enjoyed

- 28 -

Box 5. Mexico: Developments in Mexico’s External Competitiveness
Growth in Mexico’s exports has closely followed
cycles in U.S. activity since the mid-1990s.
China’s export growth also showed a close
correspondence up until early 2002. Since then,
China’s exports to the U.S. have grown much more
quickly than the historical relationship would
suggest, and its U.S. market share has expanded
rapidly.
Specific structural factors appear to explain the
shifts in U.S. trade shares:
• Much of China’s gain in market share appears to
be the result of Japanese firms moving
production to China, particularly after China’s
accession to the WTO.
• Mexico’s export share losses have been related to
an orientation on small- and medium-sized cars,
and those produced by U.S. manufacturers. Both
segments of the U.S. car market were relatively
weak during the U.S. downturn.
• Some Mexican industries—especially those with
low shipping costs—declined as goods became
“commoditized,” no longer requiring fast
shipment between the U.S. parent and Mexican
plants. As a result, production of toys and some
electronic products shifted to countries with
lower wages. Similarly, garment makers moved
to Central America, where wages can be one
fourth of those in Mexico after including social
security and other benefits.
The strength of the peso during 1999-2002 may
also have played a role in reducing Mexico’s
market share. With the real effective exchange rate
having depreciated by about 25 percent from its peak
in 2001, however, price competitiveness has
substantially increased. This is consistent with the
decline in the non-oil current account deficit from
about 6 percent of GDP in 2000 to 4¼ percent in
2003.

- 29 -

advantages, notably proximity to the U.S. market, that resulted in continued specialization
toward exports that either needed to be delivered quickly or were expensive to transport. Staff
expressed the view that, with a freely floating exchange rate and a modest current account
deficit, competitiveness was not an issue from the point of view of macroeconomic imbalances.
But
Mexico would need to actively pursue reforms that would raise underlying productivity to ensure
that maintaining competitiveness was consistent with robust growth in real incomes. These
reforms included improving the public infrastructure and lowering its cost (particularly in the
energy, transportation, and communication sectors), making the labor market more flexible, and
improving the legal system.
39.
The authorities have concluded a trade agreement with Japan. While Mexico’s trade
with Japan is limited, staff estimates suggest a modest increase in bilateral trade and Mexican
welfare.15 While the free trade agreement negotiated between the United States and Central
American countries (CAFTA) could affect Mexico’s maquiladora sector, the authorities
believed the impact would be minimal given the small size of these countries and because the
sector most affected—low value-added textiles—had largely moved abroad. The elimination of
quotas under the Multi-Fibre Agreement (MFA) is likely to have a larger negative impact on
Mexico than CAFTA, as it opens further the U.S. market to exports from Asia.
E.

Vulnerabilities

40.
The authorities and the staff agreed that the economy remains generally well placed
to absorb adverse shocks. Mexico’s investment-grade rating was well-established, and some
agencies saw the possibility of further upgrades. Financial reforms were beginning to pay off in
the form of higher credit growth and diversification of financial instruments. Corporate and
financial sector balance sheets have strengthened significantly, as evidenced by their resilience
to recent swings in exchange and interest rates. Particularly notable was the continuing
development of the peso-denominated fixed-rate debt market for corporate issuance,
underpinned by growth in institutional funds that could invest in these instruments. The stock
market, in contrast, remained stagnant as a funding source. Small- and medium-sized firms still
faced important financing constraints, but there was optimism that bank lending in this area was
reviving.
41.
Staff welcomed the authorities’ steps to strengthen further the public debt
structure. External debt management operations have aimed at reducing debt-service costs and
lengthening maturities by prepaying debt obtained at less favorable conditions, broadening the
investor base, and diversifying financing sources. Domestic debt management has focused on
increasing maturities and raising the share of fixed-rate debt, thus reducing refinancing risks and
promoting financial market development. Favorable market conditions and increased investor
15

policy initiatives on Mexico.

- 30 -

confidence allowed the introduction of a 20-year fixed-rate bond in October 2003, lengthening
the peso yield curve. In addition, the agreement with banks to exchange FOBAPROA for IPAB
debt has allowed the authorities to smooth the amortization profile.
42.
Some vulnerabilities remain in public financing. About 35 percent of augmented debt
is external, while about 60 percent of domestic debt is still either short-term or linked to
short-term interest rates. Furthermore, gross financing needs of the public sector, estimated at
close to 12 percent of GDP in 2004, are sizable. The authorities emphasized their intention to
continue strengthening the debt structure. Staff noted that, in recent years, these efforts had been
facilitated by declines in both global interest rates and emerging market spreads. As a result,
debt-service costs had fallen at the same time as the structure was strengthened. Looking ahead,
the tradeoff could be more challenging. The authorities underscored their intention to pursue a
disciplined, pre-announced strategy to debt issuance—the schedule for the rest of 2004 had been
reaffirmed in spite of changes in market conditions.
43.
Mexico’s gross external financing requirements create moderate vulnerabilities to
adverse shifts in market sentiment. For 2004, gross external financing requirements are
estimated at US$48 billion, equivalent to around 7 percent of GDP. Mexico has enjoyed
favorable external conditions, as high oil prices, record remittance inflows, and low interest rates
lowered the current account deficit to only 1½ percent of GDP. Of course, a sharp drop in oil
prices could cause an abrupt widening in both the external and fiscal deficits. Immediate risks
are low, however, as the government has already met its external financing requirement for the
year and liquid market conditions resulted in strong capital inflows to the private sector during
the first half of the year.
44.
Staff and the authorities agreed that a projected medium-term current account
deficit of close to 2 percent of GDP was manageable, as long as confidence in policies was
maintained (Table 3). About 70 percent of the deficit would be financed by FDI, and the
remainder by public and private sector borrowing (including PIDIREGAS) and portfolio inflows.
With Mexico’s net external liabilities projected to remain stable at about 40 percent of GDP, and
debt-service payments falling as debt is rolled over on more favorable terms, medium-term
external sustainability did not appear to be a problem, provided a prudent policy framework was
maintained (Annex IV).
45.
Overall, staff expressed the view that Mexico was well protected against a sudden
financial crisis. Remaining vulnerabilities nevertheless left scope for market pressures to impact
on financing costs, and could slow progress in further raising the sovereign credit rating. It was
important to continue the process of crisis-proofing the economy to fully establish market
confidence and provide room for policy actions to buffer shocks.
F.

Structural Reforms

46.
The structural reform agenda has been stalled by a lack of political consensus. Of
the major elements of the reform agenda, the authorities believed that further energy reform was

- 31 -

least feasible, as there was significant popular opposition to further participation by the private
sector. The emphasis in the period ahead would be on entrenching the progress that had already
been made, notably in the areas of electricity generation and natural gas exploration. The
authorities observed, however, that continued legal challenges for gas multiple-service contracts
created political and legal risks for new arrangements. These contracts were also losing
attractiveness for service-providing companies, as rising energy prices increased their incentive
to explore in areas where they would capture the upside benefits.
47.
The authorities agreed with staff that there was scope for reform outside the
legislative arena, including regulatory reforms. Competition in the telecommunication sector
could be increased considerably. The authorities acknowledged that telecommunications tariffs
are high by international standards and that efforst should be made to promote more competition
in this market. Recent attempts at leveling the playing field had produced limited results, but the
government was considering new initiatives, including broadening the services provided by
cable operators.
G.

Other Issues

48.
Despite declines in average per capita real incomes during 2001–03, Mexico has
made further progress in reducing poverty (Table 6). The authorities attributed this to the
reprioritization of social spending under the strategy for social development (CONTIGO), which
focuses on better organization and targeting of government programs to reduce poverty. High
remittance inflows have also played a role. Mexico is broadly on track to achieve its Millennium
Development Goals, except for a few indicators, which were expected to improve slowly.
49.
Mexico is party to the major anti-terrorism conventions. It has endorsed the
methodology adopted by the IMF, World Bank, and FATF for assessing systems to prevent
money laundering and terrorist financing. Mexico is also party to the OECD convention; a final
report on actions in this area is expected to be submitted by June 2004. The main source of
illegal proceeds of funds remains drug trafficking, where progress is impeded by corruption and
the financial resources of traffickers. Nevertheless, progress has been made by strengthening
prosecution and financial reporting.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
50.
The broad-based recovery underway this year provides encouraging evidence that
the factors holding back Mexico’s growth during 2001–03 were temporary. Business
confidence and investment have risen, FDI inflows are strengthening, exports have picked up,
and market perceptions of Mexico remain favorable. Objectives for the traditional fiscal balance
have continued to be met, albeit with the help of rising world oil prices, and the public debt
structure has improved further. While inflation has risen moderately above the authorities’
objective, it remains far below levels historically experienced by Mexico, and does not present a
risk to financial stability. Progress in modernizing the financial sector has continued, and balance
sheets appear healthy.

- 32 -

51.
With these positive factors in place, sustaining robust growth will rely on
completing the task of fully establishing market confidence, while providing a supportive
environment for private activity. Raising market confidence requires continued pursuit of
sound macroeconomic and financial sector policies, and demonstrating the capacity to take
advantage of favorable conditions to reduce vulnerabilities. Not only would this increase
Mexico’s ability to absorb negative shocks, it would create scope to actively offset them through
policy measures. Yet financial stability is necessary but not sufficient for sustained growth. The
private sector also needs confidence in the commitment to push ahead with a structural reform
agenda that promotes competition, increases legal certainty and public security, reduces market
rigidities, and harnesses Mexico’s resources—particularly in the energy sector—as fully and
efficiently as possible. Continuing progress in these areas is needed to place Mexico firmly in the
group of fast-growing emerging market economies.
52.
In the area of fiscal policy, the government has met deficit targets, but the budget
has become increasingly reliant on oil revenues, and public debt has edged up. Lowering the
augmented deficit is central to reducing fiscal vulnerabilities. Meeting targets for the traditional
deficit does not ensure a gradual decline in the ratio of augmented public debt to GDP, as
indicated by the experience in 2002–03. More binding medium-term targets are needed for the
augmented deficit and public debt. While recent success in meeting deficit targets is welcome, it
does not address the increasing dependency of the budget on volatile oil revenues. Stronger
mechanisms are needed to ensure that a substantial portion of windfall oil revenues is saved,
which in turn requires either greater spending discipline or tax measures to achieve appreciable
increases in non-oil revenues. Postponing these choices through the spending of excess oil
revenues is likely to increase the size of the needed fiscal adjustment, and perhaps make its
timing less favorable.
53.
Staff welcome the commitment to fiscal discipline represented by the lower deficit
targets in the draft budget for 2005. Meeting them, however, is likely to require more
spending restraint than has been evident in recent years, even if oil prices remain high. In such a
case, the authorities are encouraged to aim at saving significantly more of the excess oil revenues
for the medium term than is expected in 2004. A decline in oil prices to the level assumed in the
budget, on the other hand, would provide a challenging test of the government’s ability to cut
spending in the face of adverse shocks.
54.
In either case, fiscal reforms would play an important role in achieving further
consolidation. Formal fiscal responsibility principles could help, for instance, to reduce the
spending of windfall oil revenues, but would be more effective if they focused on augmented
fiscal measures, and contained provisions to avoid slippages in meeting medium-term targets.
Tax reform to raise non-oil revenues is needed to avoid budget cuts that would jeopardize
spending in social areas and on public infrastructure. Pension reform is also essential to put the
fiscal accounts on a sound path. Finally, action to enhance the accountability and efficiency of
some public enterprises, including PEMEX, is needed to strengthen the fiscal position and raise
the quality of Mexico’s infrastructure.

55.
After considerable success in bringing down inflation, monetary policymakers
currently face a challenging environment for both formulating and communicating
policies. Although the long-term target is close to being met, taking the last step is proving to be
problematic in an environment of repeated price shocks. Notwithstanding the temporary nature
of most of these shocks, they pose a risk of prolonging the disinflationary process and make it
more costly. Against this background, the BOM has appropriately tightened policy to ensure the
credibility of its commitment to lowering inflation to 3 percent. Staff believe that a tightening
bias in policy, including allowing the full pass-through of U.S. policy actions to Mexican
markets, is appropriate until there are clear signs that inflation expectations are declining toward
the long-term objective.
56.
Staff supports efforts to refine monetary policy announcements in a way that more
directly signals the BOM’s views to markets. Steps in this direction have led to more stable
short-term interest rates in recent months, as well as more predictable market responses to
domestic and external policy actions. In the staff’s view, further transparency and predictability
in policy implementation could be achieved over time by moving to an interest rate instrument.
In terms of the inflation-targeting framework, staff believes that progress toward publication of
an official inflation forecast would be desirable to clearly motivate policy actions and anchor
private-sector expectations. Yet staff recognizes that there may be drawbacks to such a step in
the immediate circumstances, given the evolving nature of monetary instruments and the risks of
adding to uncertainty about policy intentions at a critical time.
57.
Mexico’s flexible exchange rate regime has been effective in cushioning the economy
from external shocks in recent years. The recent level of external competitiveness appears to
be broadly consistent with a sustainable balance of payments position. International reserves
remain adequate in the context of a flexible exchange rate, both in their coverage of short-term
external debt and Mexico’s gross annual financing needs. Staff agrees that the rules-based
mechanism for accumulating foreign reserves is consistent with the authorities’ transparent
approach to reserves management and commitment to a market-determined exchange rate.
Recent actions demonstrate a desirable degree of flexibility in adjusting the mechanism to ensure
it is functioning soundly.
58.
Mexico’s financial system is generally sound and well-regulated. The staff welcomes
the steps already taken, as well as those under consideration—including a framework for bank
resolution—to strengthen supervision. The banking system as a whole has a sound level of
profitability and capital adequacy. Nevertheless, staff agrees with the authorities that a
significant challenge in the period ahead is to deepen financial activity without excessive risktaking, and to streamline financial regulation to encourage innovation and competition. Staff
supports the high priority attached by the authorities to strengthening oversight of nonbank
institutions, which have grown rapidly in recent years. A review of the operations of
development banks would be desirable to ensure that their continuing role is well motivated, and
that they do not present a source of hidden financial risks.
59.
Staff supports the authorities’ commitment to continue reducing vulnerabilities
relating to public debt. In addition to sustained progress with fiscal consolidation, the debt

- 34 -

structure would be strengthened by further increasing issuance of fixed-rate domestic-currency
instruments, extending the domestic yield curve, and diversifying the investor base. Regarding
vulnerabilities linked to private debt, the deepening of the domestic bond market associated with
the rapid growth of institutional investors should diversify financing sources, lowering liquidity
and contagion risk and reducing foreign currency mismatches in firms’ balance sheets.
60.
Mexico’s data are generally of high quality, and are adequate to conduct
surveillance. The authorities are encouraged to implement the recommendations of the 2003
statistical ROSC.
61.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Mexico take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

ANNEX II

MEXICO—STATISTICAL ISSUES
Core data are published on a timely basis and are of good quality. Mexico observes the Special
Data Dissemination Standards (SDDS) and its metadata are posted on the Dissemination
Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB). Regarding fiscal data, both the preliminary (available with a
45-day lag following the end of each quarter) and the final (available mid-year of the subsequent
year) data are published and submitted to congress, ensuring that revisions are transparent and
subject to public scrutiny.
Although some of the balance of payments statistics conform to the fifth edition of the Balance
of Payments Manual, a full transition has not yet been completed. Several measures to improve
external debt statistics have been carried out, including the compilation of data on external
liabilities of publicly traded companies registered with the Mexican stock exchange (external
debt outstanding, annual amortization schedule for the next four years broken down by maturity,
and type of instrument), but a projection of the total external debt service of commercial banks is
still not available. International reserves data are compiled according to the Operational
Guidelines for the Data Template on International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity of
the IMF (October 1999).
In the fiscal area, the authorities have reported since 2001 a comprehensive measure of the fiscal
balance—the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement—that encompasses the direct net cost of
public investment projects with deferred recording in the fiscal accounts (PIDIREGAS) as well
as the interest cost on a number of government liabilities that had not been previously recorded.
A data ROSC for Mexico was completed on May 23, 2003 and was subsequently published as
IMF Country Report No. 03/150. The overall quality of Mexican statistics is good. In a number
of cases, the periodicity and timeliness of disseminated data exceeded SDDS requirements
However, there are various areas where improvements could be made. The authorities are aware
of this situation and are continuing work in this regard.

ANNEX III

Mexico—Relations with the World Bank
The World Bank continues to support closely and successfully Mexico’s development progress.
The Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Mexico, as discussed by its Board in May
2002, focuses on five strategic objectives: 1) consolidating the macroeconomic framework; 2)
accelerating growth through competitiveness; 3) human capital development; 4) balancing
growth and poverty reduction with environmental protection; and 5) building an efficient,
transparent, and accountable government. The Bank will retain a rich program of analytical work
and offer a three-year (FY2003–05), US$5 billion lending envelope (half of which in fastdisbursing operations) that balances macro- and micro-oriented activities, and caters to the three
levels of government (federal, state, and municipal). Support will depend on the conduciveness
of legal and regulatory environments and, when necessary, on the political consensus for the
required reforms; lacking that consensus, lending will be correspondingly lower.
Using the program flexibility built into the 1999 CAS, the Bank was able to deliver, over the
past four years, assistance both at the broad reform agenda and at the sectoral level. New lending
committed during the FY1999–2002 period remained at US$4.8 billion. The Bank’s analytical
work carried out over the past few years in support of its lending program and policy dialogue
with the Mexican government was summarized in a collection of Policy Notes,1 covering more
than 30 different sectors and themes.
Recently, the Bank extended several loans to deliver support for the five objectives in the CAS.
In education, the second phase of a plan to strengthen the Government of Mexico’s
compensatory education program is being supported through a US$300 million loan. In support
of the recent reforms in the area of taxation, especially the corporate and personal income tax,
and to improve tax compliance and reduce tax evasion, the Bank extended two loans to an
amount of US$355 million. The Bank also continues to support the further strengthening of
Mexico’s financial sector, in particular through a US$64.6 million loan that focuses on
increasing the access of rural low-income population to financial services. Strengthening the
ongoing decentralization in Mexican public finance, the Bank also supports a program aimed at
increasing the efficiency of small-scale social and productive, municipal infrastructure
investments, through a US$400 million loan that enhances the administrative and technical
capacity of municipalities.
As of July 2002, the Bank’s portfolio consists of 24 active projects with a total undisbursed
balance of US$3.6 billion. Average annual disbursements over the past four years of
US$1.2 billion have led to a slight decrease in exposure to Mexico, currently at US$11 billion,
within the Bank’s nominal indicative, single-borrower exposure ceiling of US$13.5 billion.

ANNEX IV

Mexico: Sustainability Assessment Frameworks
Public sector debt
The sustainability of Mexico’s public sector debt remains vulnerable to a worsening of the
economic environment and fiscal consolidation delays.
Mexico’s public sector gross debt is projected to remain above 50 percent of GDP in three
different scenarios (Figure 1.A). Under the baseline scenario, high oil prices and the authorities’
fiscal consolidation plans would bring about a gradual reduction in the debt ratio, down to about
45 percent of GDP by 2009. However, public debt is projected to stay around its current level if
oil prices were to fall abruptly to $20 per barrel or fiscal adjustment did not take place.1 A
combination of these shocks together with higher interest rates would produce a steady rise in
the debt ratio, up to close to 60 percent of GDP by 2009.
One-off shocks, alone, would not put the debt ratio on an unsustainable path (Figure 1.B).
However, slower growth and exchange rate depreciation, based on the historical volatility of
these variables, would result in rapid increases in the public debt ratio—by about 4 percentage
points of GDP within a two-year period.
External debt
The sustainability of Mexico’s external debt appears resilient to a worsening of the economic
environment.
Mexico’s vulnerability to external shocks is low under the baseline and a scenario combining
higher interest rates and lower oil prices (Figure 2).2 The external debt-to-GDP ratio would
remain in the 23–26 percent of GDP range throughout the period. In the scenario combining
higher interest rates and lower oil prices, gross external financing need would increase
moderately in US dollar terms compared to the baseline scenario.
Under the two most extreme shocks—depreciation of the peso by 2 standard deviations in the
historic data, or about 24 percent in 2005 and 2006, and a mix of higher nominal interest rates,
lower GDP growth rates, and exchange rate depreciation by 1 standard deviation—Mexico’s
external situation would worsen dramatically.3 External debt would approach 45 percent of GDP
and 2006 gross external financing needs would double in US$ terms as compared to 2004.
1

The no policy change scenario assumes no net fiscal savings over the medium-term.

2

The country-specific scenario assumes domestic interest rates higher by 100 basis points in 2005-2006
and a sharp decline in the price of Mexican oil to US$20 per barrel.

3

Sample standard deviations are high because the historic series include Tequila crisis. Excluding
1994-96 lowers the 2006 projected debt-to-GDP ratio under the most extreme shock to below 38 percent
of GDP.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
October 18, 2004
The following information has become available since the staff report was issued to
Executive Directors. The thrust of the staff appraisal remains unchanged.
1.
Recent indicators are consistent with continuing economic recovery. The index
of overall economic activity rose by 3.5 percent in July over the previous year, while gross
fixed investment increased by 8.6 percent over the same period, and retail sales grew by
4.8 percent. Industrial production rose by 4.7 percent in August over the previous year.
2.
Headline CPI inflation increased to 5.1 percent in September (12-month basis),
while core inflation edged up to 3.8 percent. Contractual wage settlements rose to
4.8 percent in September after averaging 4½ percent in the first eight months of the year. In
mid-October, Mexico's social security institute (IMSS) and its unions agreed on a 3 percent
wage increase plus 1 percent in benefits for the next twelve months. Inflation expectations
for end-2004 climbed further to 4.6 percent in the September survey.
3.
The Bank of Mexico (BOM) increased the corto for the sixth time this year on
September 24. This tightening action came soon after an increase in domestic short-term
interest rates associated with the tightening in U.S. monetary policy on September 21. As a
result, short-term rates have risen by close to 50 basis points since the beginning of
September. The peso has strengthened as interest rates have risen, appreciating by about
2½ percent against the U.S. dollar since early September.
4.
Trade data for August showed a smaller-than-expected deficit. Imports
increased by 20.7 percent from the year-ago level, while exports increased by 27.3 percent
reflecting higher oil exports and non-oil export volumes. Net international reserves stood at
US$57.6 billion end-September, compared with US$57.2 billion at end-August.
5.
The price of Mexican crude oil could exceed the staff’s estimate for 2004. The
price of the Mexican mix has averaged US$30.1 per barrel for the year through
mid-October, compared with staff assumption of U$31.4 per barrel for the year as a whole.
The current spot price stands near US$40 per barrel, suggesting that the average price for
the year could modestly exceed the staff’s assumption.
6.
On September 22, the government issued US$1 billion of 30-year bonds to prefund 2005 financing requirements. The bond was issued with a yield of 6.9 percent,
implying a spread of 210 basis points over U.S. treasuries. High demand for the bond
allowed the amount issued to increase from US$1 to US$1.5 billion. Pemex also recently
issued a US$1.75 billion perpetual bond with a coupon of 7.75 percent in Asian markets.
Mexico continues to include collective action clauses (CACs) in bond issues.

Statement by Moises Schwartz, Executive Director for Mexico
October 18, 2004

During the last few years the Mexican economy has been characterized by macroeconomic
stability, efficient debt management, financial sector soundness and compliance with
international standards and codes in a number of areas. The recovery of the economy is well
underway. GDP is expected to post a growth of 4.0 percent in 2004 and 3.8 percent in 2005.
The upturn of the economy is linked to the strength of the global economy, particularly to
that of the US. Recent manufacturing and maquila exports reflect the strengthening of world
recovery and imports of intermediate goods anticipate growth of industrial activity.
Consumption and investment have also shown increased dynamism. The recovery has been
widespread among the different sectors and has resulted in improved employment indicators.
The current account deficit, which accounted for more than 7 percent of GDP in the run-up to
the 1994-95 crisis, is down to a sustainable 1.5 -2.0 percent of GDP. International reserves
have increased ten-fold over the past ten years to close to US$60 billion and a decade of a
successful floating-exchange-rate regime has almost been completed. The current floating
scheme and prudent macroeconomic policies have placed the country in a much better
position to deal with capital market disturbances and prevented the build up of external
disequilibria.
Inflation and Monetary Policy
During the last eight years inflation has declined significantly, reaching levels that had not
been experienced for over three decades. Single digit inflation has become the norm and
inflation reached a figure under 4 percent at the end of 2003. Notwithstanding, recent
inflation has been boosted by supply shocks, including a temporary suspension of some meat
imports from the US, climate effects on agricultural prices and the impact of higher
international prices for oil and other commodities. In particular, it should be noted that the
increases in administered prices have resulted from the non-discretionary use of formulas that
link domestic prices to international references. Moreover, one should bear in mind that the
cyclical recovery currently experienced by the economy feeds up the pass-through of supply
shocks to consumer prices and thus has an effect on inflationary expectations.
Within the framework of an inflation-targeting scheme, the Bank of Mexico carries out a
cautious analysis of the origins of inflationary pressures and their impact on inflation
expectations. Monetary authorities have focused policy implementation on limiting the
effects on inflation expectations that result from higher commodities’ prices, remaining
vigilant to address cyclical pressures on inflation that could emerge from the strength of
aggregate demand and promoting an orderly transition to an environment of higher interest
rates. Reiterating its commitment to achieve the inflation target, the central bank has
tightened monetary policy on six occasions this year.
Staff suggests that monetary policy implementation should consider the publication of an
official inflation forecast in order to solve “problems in communicating policies” when
inflation is above target. However, the fact that headline inflation has surpassed the target

-2does not entail “communications problems”. Inflation has recently peaked up as a result of
imported inflation, specifically, increases in commodity prices related to an upturn in world
economic activity as well as a result of geopolitical uncertainty. Inflation expectations
produced by market participants for the medium and long term place inflation within the
variability interval announced by the central bank, and communication problems are not
present. The Bank of Mexico has repeatedly tightened policy in order to bring inflation back
to its variability range.
Moreover, the fact that the central bank has not incorporated inflation forecasts in its
inflation-targeting scheme does not mean that its design has not been improved. During
recent years, the Mexican inflation-targeting framework has incorporated additional elements
that facilitate communication. For example, monetary policy announcements now take place
according to a predetermined calendar, policy statements place more emphasis on underlying
inflation and on explaining the nature of price shocks, and monetary policy implementation is
fully understandable by market participants. Furthermore, a thorough analysis of a wide
range of indicators, data and models has given the central bank a good grasp of the
transmission process of monetary policy. The publication of an official inflation forecast as
well as other refinements to Mexico’s inflation-targeting scheme are constantly evaluated by
the central bank board.
However, it is believed that at a stage when the inflation forecast might be different from the
target, an official forecast would not add much to the analysis, could even create confusion
and needlessly affect the credibility of the central bank. Let us assume, for example, that an
official inflation forecast is above the inflation target or variability interval announced by the
central bank. Once the forecast is released, and assuming that the central bank enjoys some
credibility, market participants would expect the monetary authority to implement policy in
such a way as to achieve its original target. If the central bank is able to attain the original
inflation target, the forecast looses relevance and next time a forecast is announced, market
participants will not find it useful. However, if the original target is not met, the central bank
would be regarded as a “good predictor” but as incompetent in reaching its target. In this
case, the official forecast would simply serve to “validate” higher inflation expectation and
thus affect inflation dynamics. In this case, the inflation forecast would unnecessarily delay
the disinflationary process and make the fight against inflation more difficult.
Staff should note that for those successful inflation-target countries that do provide an
inflation forecast, their forecast is almost always within their confidence or variability
interval around the point target. In this case, the inflation forecast helps guiding expectations
within the interval and, as such, it does not contradict the target. But in a situation where
current inflation is running above the target, we do not see how an official forecast could
help. On the contrary, as it has been the case, if the central bank clearly specifies that its
original target is maintained, even though current inflation exceeds such a target, and
monetary policy is clearly identified as committed to bring inflation down from the current
level to its medium term objective, then the central bank is in a stronger position to affect
inflation expectations and thus speeds up the disinflationary process. This is the alternative
that the Bank of Mexico has opted for and it has given good results. Furthermore, inflation
forecasts produced by market participants are constantly updated and contrasted with the

-3central bank’s target, so no communication problems or lack of transparency have been
present.
Fiscal Policy and Debt Management
On the fiscal front, a deficit of 0.3 percent of GDP is expected for 2004, with the aim to
reduce it to 0.1 percent in 2005. Public Sector Borrowing Requirements are expected to
amount to 2.6 percent of GDP at the end of this year and 2.1 percent in 2005. Public finances
have benefited from the oil windfall and the recovery, hence the authorities expect to
accomplish the fiscal targets without problems. Fiscal spending has become more efficient
and more transparent and the debt structure has also been strengthened.
We agree with staff that the process of fiscal consolidation that has taken place in Mexico
should have relied less on oil related revenues. Nevertheless, the following must be
emphasized. During the current Administration fiscal targets have been met (both the
traditional definition of deficit and Public Sector Borrowing Requirements) every year even
during the low growth episode that the Mexican and the world economy went through. In this
context, several countries used fiscal policy to foster the recovery, a temptation that was
avoided in Mexico. In addition, the political economy process has prioritized fiscal
consolidation over undertaking counter-cyclical policies. My authorities believe that, given
the current conditions facing the Mexican economy, this is the correct approach.
Furthermore, in the last two years and for 2005 the Income Law incorporated conservative
assumptions for the oil price, therefore permanent expenditure pressures are not being
generated by the high prices observed in the oil market. This strategy has led to excess
revenues that have been allocated to savings and investment. Certainly, it would be desirable
to increase savings as staff recommends, but it would be imprecise to consider that the
extraordinary revenue has been used to boost public-sector consumption. In sum, the
consistent achievement of the fiscal goals in recent years should not be belittle as a minor
achievement.
Notwithstanding that in recent years the achievement of fiscal goals has been favored by high
oil revenues, it must be highlighted that the composition of public spending has improved,
favoring productive investment. Therefore, once the fiscal accounts are adjusted to consider
productive investment in order to assess the sustainability of the fiscal position, we find that
public finances are better and that fiscal consolidation efforts have been greater than what an
ordinary analysis reveals.
Throughout the report one finds several instances where staff suggests that “the spending of
windfall oil revenues has made the fiscal position more vulnerable to a decline in oil prices”,
and “on the need to save a significant portion of future windfalls to avoid increasing
dependence of the budget on oil revenues”. We find these comments misleading since they
do not clearly depict what has taken place in Mexico and consider that this kind of comments
seem to confuse the economic concept of savings with that of financial savings.
We all agree that long-run fiscal sustainability would generally imply saving a portion of the
current non-renewable resource revenue. Such an approach would both stabilize usable

-4revenue and provide for the accumulation of financial resources that compensate for the
depletion of the natural resource, thus allowing to implement fiscal policies that are set
within a longer-term framework. That is, financial savings are designed to smooth
expenditure.
As opposed to the above definition of financial savings, the economic concept of saving
refers to the excess of current revenue over current expenditure with the objective of
preserving net government wealth. Savings in this case can be allocated both to public
investment or held as financial assets. Moreover, economic theory does not favor any of the
two possible destinies. However, it is common sense that if a government allocates all of its
economic savings to public investment during “good” times and fails to build up financial
assets, it might find it difficult to finance expenditures during “rainy days”.
As a result of the above considerations, Mexican authorities have tried to strike the right
balance between the allocation of excess revenues and it must be stressed that its largest
share has been devoted to investment and savings rather than current expenditures (a fact that
staff fails to recognize). According to the current Budget Decree, after deducting the
expected increase on non-programmable expenditures and the decrease in other revenue
sources, excess revenues are allocated according to a formula that distributes 74.2 percent to
savings vehicles (PEMEX trust fund, Oil Stabilization Fund and improvement of the public
balance) and 25.8 percent to infrastructure investment in the states. The fact that it is
expected that PEMEX will eventually allocate its share to investment in the development of
the Mexican oil sector (exploration, production, etc.) should not be seen as “current
expenditures” but as a measure that preserves wealth and allows the oil company to become
more efficient. We have to keep in mind that the rate of return from investing in the
development of the Mexican oil sector is substantially larger than the yield that can be
obtained from financial assets as T-bills, thus Mexico finds it more profitable to invest in the
oil sector than in financial assets.
Therefore, the assumption that in 2004 savings have been small is incorrect. Moreover, it
should also be recognized that no permanent expenditure pressures are being generated as a
result of the spending expansion associated with excess revenues. These revenues are
allocated mostly to investment and savings and are non-recurrent in nature and consequently
can not become a pressure for public finances.
As a result of the external public debt management strategy, the government faces a
comfortable debt-service payments schedule as debt has been rolled over on more favorable
terms. An example is the recent placement of US$1.5 billion at a fixed rate with a 30 year
maturity. This issuance allows the Mexican government to pre-finance most of its 2005
obligations and is in accordance with the external net debt-reduction target of US$500
million approved by Congress for this year.
Risks associated with a reduction of flows to emerging markets have considerably been
reduced by changing the composition of public debt and relying more heavily on domestic
financing. Moreover, the reduction in the cost of financing in the domestic market has
contributed to an improvement of the private sector’s balance-sheet position and in the

-5development of domestic markets. The maturity of the yield curve has been extended up to
20 years. Institutional investors are now interested in domestic issuances with long-term
fixed rates due to further progress in the development of the financial system and reforms to
the pension system. In order to further reduce interest rate risk, the government will continue
to substitute debt with floating rates for new instruments with fixed rates. Currently, almost
50 percent of domestic debt instruments with a maturity of one year or more are linked to
fixed rates, compared to nearly 15 percent at the end of 2000. It is expected that domestic
debt will represent 65 percent of public debt in 2005, compared to 53 percent in 2000.
In the staff’s treatment of the evolution of the debt to GDP ratio one should realize that, in
recent years, the path of this ratio has been more influenced by the behavior of the exchange
rate of the Mexican peso with respect to the dollar as well as by the exchange rate of the
dollar with respect to other currencies in which public debt is subscribed. This is an
important clarification since usually an increase of the debt to GDP ratio can erroneously be
interpreted as lack of fiscal discipline. Exchange rate movements are temporary in nature and
therefore the authorities expect debt as a share of GDP to return to a decreasing path.
The international comparison sections of the Selected Issues paper on the “Structure and
Cost of Public Debt in Mexico” show that the current broad public debt level in Mexico is
lower than the median value of emerging market economies as a percentage of GDP, support
the conception that Mexico’s public debt level is not high and claim that the size of the
Mexican public debt does not itself prevent future rating upgrades. As such, the referred
analysis refutes the Staff Report’s characterization of Mexican debt in paragraph 25 as
“uncomfortably high”.
Output Gap, Productivity and Structural Reform
Staff’s growth assumptions for 2005-2009 deserve further analysis. The rate of growth of
potential output at the baseline scenario (2.9 percent) seems low, as it is based on a totalfactor-productivity (TFP) growth rate assumption heavily influenced by the large negative
swings observed in the periods of crisis of the 80s and 90s. Therefore, it is not consistent
with estimates of potential growth for the periods 1996-2001/2002, carried out by previous
studies and by the background paper itself. Along with the TFP growth estimation problems,
the output gap (below 2 percent) to infer the behavior of GDP growth is small since it
overlooks the macroeconomic conditions and is affected by end-of-sample problems. These
factors may be leading to a substantial underestimation of growth for the next years. Taking
into account that: (a) trend TFP growth should be higher, (b) the output gap is larger than
estimated in the paper, (c) the process of getting back to the potential output should take 3-4
years at most, and (d) the fact that the Mexican economy is still to benefit from the recent
financial sector reforms and from a sounder banking system, the average growth rate for
2005-2009 should be revised upwards by at least 0.5 percent. This is important since growth
forecasts have an effect on all the medium-term fiscal projections produced by staff.
We agree with staff that medium-term growth prospects are contingent on making progress
in the reform agenda. Analytical work has emphasized that lack of further economic reforms
accounts for the failure to deliver growth and development. Significant challenges remain in

-6Mexico’s structural reform process. The absence of progress in implementing structural
reforms has affected competitiveness. Authorities have been engaged in a constructive
dialogue with all sectors in order to reach consensus on a whole set of reforms that would
boost productivity. Approval by the Legislative branch is in the best interest of the country as
it would contribute to raise potential growth.
Statistical Coverage of Fiscal Accounts
Mexico is a strong believer in the usefulness of Fund’s surveillance. In the last ten years, the
availability and transparency of Mexican economic and financial indicators have increased
considerably and, as noted on the staff report and on the ROSC on data dissemination, the
overall quality of statistics is good and timely. Mexico observes the SDSS and its metadata
are posted on the DSBB. We understand the importance of fiscal indicators, including those
of the non-financial public sector, and publish our fiscal targets. Since 2001 Mexico
publishes a comprehensive measure of the fiscal balance--the Public Sector Borrowing
Requirement--which includes the financing needs of public entities and of private and social
entities that act on the government’s behalf.
However, we are concerned by the fact that the coverage of fiscal statistics in Fund
documents and programs varies across regions. The evenhandness of surveillance is
questioned when we note that, according to a FAD internal report, more than 80 percent of
Latin American countries provide information on the non-financial public enterprise sector.
In contrast, the operations of public enterprises in Middle-Eastern countries are not covered
in the fiscal accounts, and only 12 percent of the OECD countries provide this information.
Similarly, the coverage of fiscal targets in Fund programs in Latin America includes, in over
70 percent of the cases, non-financial public sector figures. This contrasts markedly with an
average of nearly 20 percent in the universe of country programs, and with the absence of
non-financial public sector coverage in Middle Eastern countries. If we are all to be
measured by the same yardstick, it would be required to develop indicators for all members
including all type of fiscal contingencies. We call on management and staff to design a plan
that would guarantee that all membership is subject to the same scrutiny.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
December 23, 2004

International Monetary Fund

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2004 Article IV Consultation with Mexico
On October 18, 2004, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Mexico.1
Background
After three years of weak activity, the broad-based recovery underway this year provides
encouraging evidence that the factors holding back Mexico’s growth were temporary. Business
confidence and investment have risen, foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows are
strengthening, exports have picked up sharply, and market perceptions of Mexico remain
favorable. While inflation has risen moderately above the authorities’ objective, it remains far
below levels historically experienced by Mexico. Higher oil prices and a recovery in non-oil
exports have led to a narrowing in the current account deficit. The current account deficit has
been more than matched by FDI inflows.
Economic activity accelerated to 3.8 percent in the first half of 2004 over the previous year.
This recovery is partly attributable to strengthening U.S. industrial production, as reflected in
growth in Mexican manufactured exports of 10½ percent (seasonally adjusted) in the first
seven months of 2004 over the same period in 2003. Inflation accelerated from 4 percent at
end-2003 to 5.1 percent in September, boosted by supply shocks, including a temporary
suspension of some meat imports from the United States, higher oil and commodity prices,
and their impact on administered prices. Core inflation was lower, standing at 3.8 percent, but
has shown no signs of decelerating since early 2003.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff
prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the
discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors,
and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities.

-2-

Net international reserves increased to US$58 billion in August 2004, compared with
US$48 billion at end-2002, reflecting strong PEMEX receipts. A change was made to the
mechanism for auctioning international reserves in March 2004. The Banco de Mexico
continues to pre-announce the amount of dollars to be sold in the market, equal to 50 percent
of net reserve accumulation in the previous three-month period. The sale of dollars will now,
however, be spread over the following 12 months, as opposed to three months, to reduce
volatility in the amount sold throughout the year.
Targets for the traditional deficit have been met in recent years. But the pace of fiscal
consolidation, viewed in terms of the augmented public sector deficit, has been slower than
envisaged in the authorities’ 2002 medium-term plan. While this deficit was reduced from
3.7 percent of GDP in 2000 to 3.1 percent in 2003, gross public debt rose by about 1.75
percentage points to 51 percent of GDP during those years, reflecting both currency
depreciation and slow growth. For 2004, the augmented deficit is expected to remain broadly
unchanged, while the traditional deficit would fall slightly to 0.4 percent of GDP, in line with
budget targets. The draft budget for 2005 calls for a decline in the augmented deficit to 2.2
percent of GDP, while the traditional deficit would fall to 0.1 percent of GDP.2
The Banco de Mexico has tightened policy seven times since the beginning of 2004 via
increases in the corto (the borrowed reserves objective). In addition, domestic market
conditions have been affected by the two increases in the U.S. federal funds target rate. The
overnight inter-bank (fondeo) rose from about 5 percent in January to slightly over 8 percent in
mid-September. Long-term interest rates rose by slightly less over this period, with the 10-year
government bond yield increasing from about 8½ percent in January to 10½ percent in
September. The peso depreciated by 2 percent through end-September after falling by
6½ percent against the U.S. dollar in 2003.
Market sentiment toward Mexico remains positive, as reflected in its investment-grade status.
After a short-lived spike to 250 basis points in mid-May as U.S. interest rates rose, Mexico’s
EMBI+ spread has fallen back to about 180 basis points.
The government has made significant progress in strengthening the structure of public debt.
Several liability management operations, including an exchange of global bonds in early 2004,
have helped to improve the efficiency of the yield curve. Domestic public debt management
has concentrated on extending maturities, improving the liquidity of benchmark issues, and
deepening domestic financial markets. Nevertheless, some public debt vulnerabilities remain,
with a large portion of domestic debt either short term or linked to short-term interest rates.
The public sector also has a significant gross financing need.

Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Mexican authorities for their continued pursuit of sound
macroeconomic policies, and welcomed signs that recently the economic recovery has
strengthened and become more broadly based, while business confidence and investment
have risen. Meanwhile, FDI inflows have been strong, exports have picked up, and market
perceptions of Mexico remain favorable. Progress in modernizing the financial sector has
continued, and balance sheets appear healthy. The key challenges going forward will be to
enhance Mexico’s economic performance on a lasting basis by bringing inflation down to the
long-term objective, reducing debt vulnerabilities, and reinvigorating the program of structural
reforms.
On fiscal policy, Directors welcomed the authorities’ continuing commitment to medium–term
fiscal consolidation, and commended the authorities’ track record in meeting fiscal targets.
They noted that the budget is dependent on volatile oil revenues. In this context, most
Directors encouraged the authorities to aim at saving significantly more of the excess oil
revenues for the medium term, while some considered the use of part of these revenues for
productive investments to be a prudent strategy. Looking ahead, Directors urged the
authorities to establish stronger mechanisms to ensure that a substantial portion of the windfall
is saved. This will require redoubled efforts to ensure that medium-term expenditure reduction
is combined with measures to achieve significant increases in non-oil revenues.
Directors considered that fiscal reforms will have a crucial role to play in achieving further
consolidation. In particular, formal fiscal responsibility principles based on the augmented
fiscal measures should be helpful in avoiding slippages in meeting medium-term targets.
Directors regretted the setback to efforts aimed at enhancing the efficiency of the tax system
and promoting fiscal stability. They believed that tax reform to raise non-oil revenues will be
needed to avoid budget cuts that could jeopardize spending in social areas and on public
infrastructure. Pension reform will also be required to ensure that the fiscal accounts remain on
a sound path. Directors encouraged the authorities to take actions to enhance the
accountability and efficiency of several public enterprises, including PEMEX, in order to
strengthen the fiscal position and raise the quality of Mexico’s infrastructure.
Directors identified several other key elements of the reform agenda that should be pursued.
These include stepped up efforts to improve governance and enhance flexibility in the labor
market. Directors considered that building a consensus around these efforts, as well as on
actions to enhance competition in the telecommunications sector, will be vital for promoting
private investment.
Regarding monetary policy, Directors recognized the success of Mexico’s inflation targeting
framework in bringing inflation down to low single-digit levels. They noted that, although the
long-term inflation target is close to being met, sustained achievement of the target is proving
to be problematic in an environment of repeated price shocks. Directors accordingly viewed
the recent tightening of the monetary stance as appropriate to ensure the credibility of the
authorities’ commitment to lowering inflation. Looking ahead, Directors agreed that a tightening

-4-

bias in policy will remain appropriate until there are clear signs that inflation expectations are
declining toward the long-term objective.
Directors supported the authorities’ efforts to refine monetary policy announcements to signal
the policymakers’ views more directly to markets. Steps in this direction have led to more
stable short-term interest rates in recent months, as well as to more predictable market
responses to policy actions. Directors generally agreed that there is scope to further increase
transparency and predictability in policy implementation over time, including by moving to an
interest rate instrument when conditions warrant. Directors were encouraged by the
refinements to the inflation-targeting framework. Many Directors acknowledged the drawbacks
to moving toward publication of an official inflation forecast in the immediate circumstances,
given the evolving nature of monetary instruments and the risks of adding to uncertainty about
policy intentions at a critical time. However, this issue should be kept under review.
Directors observed that Mexico’s flexible exchange rate regime has been effective in
cushioning the economy from external shocks. They viewed external competitiveness to be
broadly consistent with a sustainable balance of payments position. They agreed that the
rules-based mechanism for accumulating foreign reserves appropriately reflects the
authorities’ transparent approach to reserves management and their commitment to a marketdetermined exchange rate.
Directors welcomed the continued improvement in broad indicators of banking sector
soundness. They noted that the banking system as a whole has a sound level of profitability
and capital adequacy. A significant challenge in the period ahead will be to deepen financial
activity without excessive risk-taking, and to streamline financial regulation to encourage
innovation and competition. In this regard, Directors encouraged the authorities to review the
operations of the nonbank financial sector and the development banks to ensure that they do
not pose a source of hidden financial risks.
Directors endorsed the authorities’ continued commitment to reduce vulnerabilities relating to
public debt. In addition to sustained progress with fiscal consolidation, they welcomed plans to
improve the debt structure further by continuing to increase fixed–rate domestic–currency
instruments, extending the domestic yield curve, and diversifying the investor base.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
