STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2011 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
AND PROPOSAL FOR POST-PROGRAM MONITORING

KEY ISSUES
Context: Pakistan has confronted difficult challenges in the past few years: external and
domestic economic shocks, political uncertainty, and security problems. Faced with these
challenges, Pakistan has implemented several reforms, including under the recently expired
Stand-By Arrangement, which helped the economy avoid a full-blown crisis. More recently,
however, continued security issues, unresolved structural problems (especially in the energy
sector), two major floods, and large fiscal deficits accommodated by the central bank have
combined to make inflation persistently high, and limit growth and employment creation.
These have left Pakistan’s economy highly vulnerable, with few buffers to absorb shocks.
Given this context, the 2011 Article IV discussions focused on macroeconomic policies to
address vulnerabilities and reforms to promote robust inclusive growth.
The Outlook: On current policies, Pakistan’s near- and medium-term prospects are not
good. Growth would remain too low to absorb the large number of new entrants into the
labor force, inflation would remain high, and the external position would weaken
significantly. Moreover, there are considerable downside risks to this somber baseline, in the
context of an increasingly fragile global environment and concerns about policy weakening
ahead of senate elections in 2012 and parliamentary elections in 2013. The current mix of
large fiscal deficits and accommodative monetary policy is increasingly unsustainable.
Main policy recommendations: Urgent policy action is needed on three fronts, to contain
vulnerabilities, and to place Pakistan on a higher, inclusive growth trajectory: (i) strengthen
public finances through revenue mobilization, cuts in wasteful and low-priority expenditure,
and a strengthened fiscal decentralization framework; (ii) reform the energy sector to reduce
power shortages and the large untargeted electricity subsidies, and more generally reduce
the government’s footprint in the economy; and (iii) implement financial policies to reduce
inflation, protect the external position, and safeguard the stability of the financial sector.

PAKISTAN

INTRODUCTION
1.
At the time of the last Article IV
consultation in March 2009, Pakistan was
slowly emerging from the 2008 crisis.
Supported by the Stand-By Arrangement
(SBA) approved in November 2008,
economic activity had begun to rebound,
inflation was declining, and, most
importantly, a full-blown crisis was averted.
2.
Since then, despite some progress
under the last SBA, economic institutions
and policies remain weak. The authorities
have implemented some reforms, including
improvements in tax administration, removal
of some tax exemptions, the introduction of
an interest rate corridor, establishment of a
more market-based exchange rate regime,
and a strengthening of the State Bank of
Pakistan’s (SBP) enforcement powers for
dealing with problem banks. In addition,
they have raised domestic prices of the main
petroleum products by about 70 percent
and electricity tariffs by about 90 percent
since early 2008, while achieving a reduction
in inflation, especially in 2009. Moreover, the
Benazir Income Support Program (BISP) has
provided basic income support to the poor
during the various shocks that have hit
Pakistan. Yet, other key reforms were not
followed through, and the program went
off-track in June 2010 (following the fourth
review in May 2010), and stayed off-track
until it expired at end-September 2011.
3.
The outlook for Pakistan is
challenging. At present, macroeconomic
policies are overly expansionary and
fundamental reforms to resolve the
economy’s structural problems are not
being tackled well. As a result, the economy
is increasingly vulnerable, with weak growth,

4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

persistent inflation, rising balance-ofpayments pressures, and few buffers to
absorb shocks. And with senate elections in
March 2012 and parliamentary elections in
2013, the political climate is not conducive
to reform.
4.
Against this background, the
discussions focused on the policies
needed to reduce vulnerabilities, build
buffers, and promote inclusive growth—
one that allows all segments of the
population to contribute to and benefit
from economic growth. There was broad
concurrence between the authorities and
the mission on policy priorities, namely,
tighter fiscal policy, a less accommodative
monetary policy stance, and structural
reforms (especially in the fiscal and energy
sectors) to strengthen the economy’s
medium-term growth potential. The mission
stressed that the government should build
on its New Growth Strategy to develop a
comprehensive economic strategy for the
next several years, a strategy with broad
buy-in from stakeholders in Pakistan (Box 1).
The reforms under this strategy would need
to correct a number of the key
microeconomic and institutional problems
that are at the root of macroeconomic
imbalances and low growth. They relate in
part to the nature of the government’s
intervention in the economy—for instance,
in the area of agricultural procurement and
electricity subsidies—and patronage, weak
management, poor service delivery and
other governance issues that have created a
fertile ground for rent-seeking and
corruption.

Box 1. Pakistan’s New Growth Strategy
The government of Pakistan recognizes that the economy has performed well below its
potential and requires an annual average rate of 7 percent to absorb youth labor growth. It
has therefore formulated a new growth strategy (NGS).1 The NGS promotes sustained growth by
addressing what it considers the two main constraints to growth: (i) inadequate market
development, caused by lack of competition, policy distortions, entry barriers, and poor
regulation; and (ii) inefficient public sector management, especially in the provision of core public
goods such as security of life, property, transactions, and contracts, and in the accumulation of
human and physical capital. The NGS encourages a joint government and private effort to
increase productivity by tackling: noncompetitive markets, poor governance, limited urban
development, inadequate education, low openness, and limited innovation due to limited
research. It also acknowledges the role that provincial governments will play following the 18th
amendment of the Constitution.

A country with abundant potential.
Pakistan is of considerable geostrategic
importance, straddling Central Asia, and South
Asia, and close to the Middle East, and rich in
natural and human resources. Expansion of
regional trade is a particular opportunity for
Pakistan, as is the potential demographic
dividend from a young population.1 Pakistan’s
high potential, however, is not being fully
realized because of several structural factors.
6.
A difficult political structure and
major internal security problems. Important
steps have been taken in recent years to build
democracy, but, as in other countries, the
transition has not been smooth. Since 2008, a
civilian coalition government has been in
power. The judiciary and the press have
become more independent, but at the same
time the military continues to have
considerable political influence. Political
instability, along with rent-seeking and
patronage, has undermined attempts at
sustained economic reform and fiscal
discipline. Internal security has also remained a
major challenge.

About half of Pakistan’s population is under the age
of 20.

Pakistan (amounting to US$451 million) to help cope
with the aftermath of the 2010 floods.

PAKISTAN

Pakistan is vulnerable to fluctuations in
international commodity prices.
8.
A weak fiscal structure. Government
tax revenue is about 10 percent of GDP, one of
the lowest in the world. There is a general
unwillingness to pay taxes, due to poor public
service delivery and because of perceived
unfairness in the tax system. For example, a
major sector, agriculture, is mostly outside the
tax net, and the number of taxpayers filing
income tax returns is very small relative to the
size of the population (about 1 percent). At the
same time, there are large demands for
government spending. Most notably, subsidies
(mostly electricity subsidies) and interest
payments consume almost half of government
revenue while security spending uses up
another quarter. As a result, there are large
budget deficits that are difficult to finance,
especially when foreign assistance is limited.
Therefore, budgetary management relies too
much on the containment of investment
spending and borrowing from the banking
system.
9.
Large loss-making public enterprises
sap fiscal resources. A number of publicsector enterprises (PSEs), especially in the
power, transportation, and agriculture sectors,
operate without hard budget constraints and
incur large losses. Subsidies to cover these
losses, which amounted to nearly 2 percent of
GDP in 2010/11,3 divert resources away from
more productive spending.
10.
Increased fiscal decentralization
without clear rules (Appendix 1). The seventh

between the federal and provincial budgets,
allocated a much larger share of government
revenue to provinces starting from July 2010.
Thus, more than half of federally collected tax
revenue is now transferred to the provinces.
Further, the implementation of the 18th
Constitutional Amendment in July 2011
devolved additional expenditure
responsibilities to the provinces, but in some
areas, the assignment of responsibilities
between the provinces and the center is not
yet clearly defined. Revenue raised by
provinces themselves is very low and finances
only a small share of provincial spending, thus
creating incentives for fiscal indiscipline.
Moreover, the rules of the game need
strengthening, and a binding mechanism
should be introduced to assure attainment of
the general government deficit target by
coordinating provincial and federal fiscal
targets.
11.
A highly constrained and
unpredictable energy supply. This
longstanding problem has been exacerbated
in recent years by a lack of investment, price
distortions, and poor management of the
sector. While many reform plans have been
prepared, implementation has not been
sustained. As a result, there are widespread
outages (averaging eight hours a day in the
summer of 2011), which is a large constraint
on growth (estimated at 2 percent of GDP) and
employment. Budgetary electricity subsidies
reached about 1½ percent of GDP in 2010/11
(including 0.6 percent of GDP recognition of
past subsidies), higher than the expenditure on
health. A tariff rate below the level needed for
cost recovery, and poor collections, has
brought about a buildup of interenterprise
arrears (circular debt, estimated at 3 percent of
GDP). These arrears have been partly financed
by credit from banks that further crowds out

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

7

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT AND POST-PROGRAM MONITORING

the private sector. Furthermore, periodically,
the government has to take on its books the
circular debt, an additional subsidy that
undermines public finances.
12.
Private sector credit growth has
been weak (Tables 4 and 5). The government’s
large financing needs, considerable
commodity operations (see below), together
with risk aversion by banks, has led to the
increasing diversion of credit away from the
private sector, reducing funds available for
investment. Indeed, bank lending to the
private sector has declined in relation to GDP

in recent years, and has been surpassed by
lending to the public sector. This could also
reflect: (i) the deterioration in the
macroeconomic situation, which has
contributed to lower demand from the private
sector; and (ii) a rise in private-sector
nonperforming loans (NPLs), which has
reduced banks’ willingness to lend. Limited
competition between large banks and with
other sources of finance (on account of limited
capital market development) makes it easy for
banks to offer relatively low rates on deposits,
a factor contributing to wide banking sector
spreads (Appendix 2).

Economic Outcomes

Following the economic crisis of 2008, Pakistan has succeeded in taking steps toward economic
stabilization. But, reflecting its institutional structure and policy framework, as well as exogenous
shocks and a difficult global environment, Pakistan’s economic performance has been well below its
potential.
13.
Sub-par growth. Pakistan’s real GDP
growth has been on a declining trend and
relatively volatile. While there have been GDP
growth spurts (most recently during 2004–07
when annual growth averaged over 7 percent),
overall growth performance has been
disappointing, especially when compared to
other regional economies like India (Figure 1).
And in the past four years, real GDP growth
has averaged only 3 percent (Table 1),

although natural disasters have contributed to
this outcome.
14.
High unemployment. A low official
unemployment rate of 6 percent masks deep
problems (Appendix 3). Underemployment and
considerable unpaid employment (the latter
estimated at 28 percent of the employed in the
2010/11 Labor Force Survey) remain major
problems, as a large young population is not
being absorbed due to low growth and despite
many Pakistanis finding employment abroad.
Indeed, it is estimated that average GDP
growth needs to be around 7 percent per year
to absorb about 2 million new labor market
entrants annually.

Low savings and investment. Private
investment has declined in recent years,

uncertainty, problems in the banking system

commodity prices and accommodating
domestic policies, and, although it has
declined subsequently, it has remained
persistently in double digits.4 Staff analysis
suggests that central bank financing of the
fiscal deficit has been an important driver of
inflation (Box 2). In addition to its obvious
impact on poverty, high inflation also hurts
growth.5

A weakening external position (Table

that reduce the supply of credit, crowding out
by the public sector, and infrastructural
bottlenecks. At the same time, public
investment has fallen as declining government
resources and rising current spending
demands have forced cuts in development
spending. And private savings remain low
compared to other countries in the region
(Figure 1).
16.
High inflation. In the decade prior to
2008, Pakistan’s inflation performance was
good. In 2008, however, inflation rose sharply
with the spillover of higher international

exchange market intervention in the spot and
forward markets. During July—December 2011,
despite increased exchange rate flexibility

In December 2011, CPI inflation slipped below
10 percent for the first time in two years (9.7 percent
year-on-year).
5

Empirical work suggests that inflation above a certain
threshold becomes harmful to growth. For Pakistan,
this inflation threshold has been estimated at
9 percent (see Mubarik, Y.A. (2005), “Inflation and
Growth: An Estimate of the Threshold Level of Inflation
in Pakistan,” State Bank of Pakistan Research Bulletin,
Vol. 1, No. 1.). Moreover, recent cross country work for
developing countries suggests a threshold of 10
percent (see Espinoza, R. et al, (2011), “When Should
We Worry About Inflation?” World Bank Economic
Review).

PAKISTAN

Box 2. Why is Inflation in Pakistan So High and Persistent?
Central bank lending to finance fiscal deficits has been a key driving force behind the high inflation levels
observed in the last few years. Before 2008, 12-month CPI inflation had averaged about 5.5 percent for more than a
decade.1 In 2008, global commodity price shocks and a sharp depreciation of the rupee led to a spike in inflation
(peaking at 25 percent year-on-year in August 2008), which, although declining, remained much higher than in the pre2008 period, and higher than in neighboring countries. Through domestic price subsidies, the global food and fuel price
shocks were reflected in larger fiscal deficits. With external financial inflows dwindling, these deficits were increasingly
financed through the SBP, which put upward pressure on prices through excessive growth in SBP net domestic assets
and exchange rate depreciation.2

Along with the inflation level, the persistence of inflation has increased since 2008. And, while moderate in
absolute terms, persistence, which is essentially the correlation between current and lagged inflation, is higher than in
the regional peers. The increase in persistence means that it now takes longer for inflation in Pakistan to return to its
equilibrium level after a common shock hits the economy, which in turn implies that inflation, and inflation expectations,
are likely to respond more sluggishly to policy changes. In fact, survey data indicates that inflation expectations have
continuously remained at around 15 percent.3 Persistence could be due to engrained inflationary expectations,
institutional features, or CPI calculation problems.
The authorities can help reduce the level and persistence of inflation by credibly adopting a less accommodative
monetary policy stance. The recent (since May 2011) decline in government borrowing from the SBP is a welcome
development. However, the switch to government borrowing from commercial banks has been supported by large
liquidity injections by the SBP, a policy that has similar inflationary effects as direct central bank financing. To reduce
inflation and increase the SBP’s policy credibility, such injections should be scaled back and direct government
borrowing from the SBP should be avoided.

Pakistan has recently started publishing a new CPI series, but a long time series is not available. Hence, for the purposes of this box,
the former CPI series is used.

A model-based analysis also confirms a statistically significant effect of SBP lending to government on inflation. A simple, singleequation model was estimated to explain the short-term relationship between headline CPI inflation and the following explanatory
variables (asterisks denote statistical significance of the estimated coefficients at the 5 percent level): inflation inertia (lagged inflation)*,
SBP claims on government*, global food price, global fuel price*, index of industrial activity (LSM) and interest rates*.

High poverty. The poverty rate was
17.2 percent in 2007/8, although broader
measures suggest poverty incidence was
almost 50 percent (UN Human Development
Report, 2011). Over the past few years, low
growth and high inflation, especially food
inflation, and two major floods have
probably led to an increase in poverty.
Although Pakistan has made progress on
strengthening human development
indicators, it ranks 145th out of 187 countries
on the UN’s Human Development Index
(Human Development Report, 2011),
progress in key areas, such as education and
health, has slowed in recent years and
Pakistan appears to be falling behind its

Moreover, the net swap/forward position

Pakistan remains without tangible access to

that the rupee could be somewhat
overvalued (Box 3). However, with declining

and commodity price variability, there is
considerable uncertainty about the extent
of overvaluation.

Box 3. Assessment of the Real Effective Exchange Rate and External Competitiveness
Pakistan’s export sector performance has been
relatively weak, especially recently. Its share of world
export volume has been trending down since the mid1980s, with a significant decline in 2007 amid the crisis. In
nominal terms, Pakistan’s share of world exports has been
relatively stable since 2007, helped by a recovery in cotton
prices.
Pakistan’s real effective exchange rate (REER) has been
relatively stable since the end of the 1990s despite
significant variations in the current account balance.
Three complementary approaches are used to assess the
degree of Pakistan's REER misalignment:
i.

ii.

iii.

Macroeconomic balance: the current account deficit
“norm” is estimated at 1¼ percent of GDP, while the
“underlying” current account deficit is estimated at
3½ percent of GDP.1 Assuming a number of different
trade balance elasticities, the difference between the
“norm” and the “underlying” current account indicates
an overvaluation of the REER of about 10 percent.2
Equilibrium exchange rate: a comparison of the current
value of the REER and an estimate of its medium-term
equilibrium value indicates that it is broadly in line with
fundamentals.3

External sustainability: assuming a negative net
international investment position of approximately 30 percent of GDP, Pakistan’s current account “norm” would be
roughly 3¼ percent of GDP, indicating that the REER is broadly in line with fundamentals.

The key to Pakistan’s external competitiveness is improving security conditions, the reliability of energy supply,
and its business environment and governance. Out of 142 countries included in the World Economic Forum’s Global
Competitiveness Report 2011–12, Pakistan ranked 118, with weaknesses identified in: (i) macroeconomic environment;
(ii) labor market efficiency; (iii) higher education and training; and (iv) infrastructure.4 The World Bank Doing Business
Report 2011, in which Pakistan ranked 83rd out of 183 countries, indicates that the cost of doing business in Pakistan
could be reduced in the following areas: (i) enforcing contracts; (ii) paying taxes; and (iii) registering property. Based on
the latest Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) of the World Bank, Pakistan ranked 57th out of 77 low
income countries with the following areas of improvement: (i) macroeconomic management; (ii) fiscal policy; and
(iii) transparency, accountability and corruption in the public sector.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
Pakistan’s economic prospects are clouded by a risky world economy and by its current policy mix.
19.
The outlook for 2011/12 is
difficult. The economy is recovering from
the floods, and real GDP growth is projected
at 3.4 percent, a pickup from 2010/11.
Average inflation is projected to be in
double digits. On the external side, the
balance of payments is coming under
pressure. The current account balance is
projected to return to a deficit, mainly
reflecting lower exports due to a weaker
external environment and lower
cotton/textile prices, and only a modest
increase in remittances (Appendix 5).
Continued difficulties in attracting external
financing and the beginning of IMF
repurchases will also put pressure on the
external position (Tables 7–8). Accordingly,
reserves are expected to decline from
US$14.8 billion at end-2010/11 to
US$12.1 billion at end-2011/12 (slightly less
than three months of imports). On the fiscal
side, the authorities’ 2011/12 deficit target
of 4.7 percent of GDP is based on optimistic
assumptions about some revenue
components, strict spending control, and a
provincial surplus. But, there is a real risk
that the reforms needed to achieve that
deficit target will not be implemented in an
election year and the deficit (overall balance
excluding grants) is likely to approach
7 percent of GDP (Tables 3a, 3b, and 3c).
20.
Similarly, under a baseline
scenario, medium-term prospects are not
bright (Table 6). With sustained elevated
fiscal deficits, credit to the private sector
would continue to be crowded out, resulting

in a continued decline in private investment
from around 11 percent of GDP to below
10 percent by 2015/16. Private savings
would decline to around 12 percent of GDP,
insufficient to support robust investment
and growth. Indeed, growth would likely
settle at about 3½ percent, half of what is
needed to absorb the rising labor force,
causing unemployment to rise. Similarly,
per capita income would grow only
modestly. Without significant fiscal
adjustment and with continued
accommodative monetary policy, inflation
would remain elevated, as would public
debt. Reflecting a widening current account
deficit and repayments to the Fund, the
international reserves cushion would
become very low (marginally above
1½ months of imports), despite assuming
large unidentified inflows.6 In other words,
in the absence of major adjustment,
Pakistan would face sizeable financing gaps
even with low projected official reserves.
Staff’s debt sustainability analysis suggests
that both external and public debt could
decline even in a baseline scenario (Tables

6

A risk-weighted metric (see “Assessing Reserve
Adequacy,” International Monetary Fund, February
2011) suggests that end-2011 reserves are at the
lower end of an estimated range for an adequate
reserves level for Pakistan. However, reserves are
projected to fall well below the adequate level in
the coming years.

9 and 10 and Figures 4 and 5).7 However,
public debt remains high throughout the
medium term, government refinancing
needs remain large, and both public and
external debts are particularly sensitive to
exchange rate depreciation. Indeed, if
Pakistan-specific risks, relating for instance
to the fiscal deficit or workers’ remittances,
were to materialize, public and external debt
sustainability could be threatened.

domestic debt; in fact, with rising fiscal
risks and a high level of claims on
government on banks’ balance sheets,
a tail risk of much lower bank demand
for domestic debt cannot be ruled out.


There are risks to inflation, especially
from possible supply shocks, pass–
through from exchange rate
depreciation, fiscal policy, and continued
accommodative monetary policy.



On the external side, inward real
sector spillovers are a risk. Financial
contagion risks from the turbulence
currently centered on Europe are
limited, but Pakistan is exposed to
negative trade and remittances
spillovers.8 Given Pakistan’s heavy
reliance on textile exports, a further
significant fall in cotton prices could
lead to external pressures.



There are growing financial stability
risks (Appendix 4). The overall banking
system is reasonably well capitalized
(nearly 15 percent of risk-weighted
assets); relatively liquid due to large
holdings of government securities; and

The risks to the outlook are tilted
to the downside. Policy space to counter
any further adverse shocks has become
limited and the amount of financial support
from the international community may not
be very large. Given large fiscal and external
financing requirements, risks relate mostly
to potential liquidity rather than solvency
concerns. In addition, security problems and
political uncertainty cloud prospects:


Fiscal gross financing requirements
are projected to be very large
(30 percent of GDP in 2011/12),
resulting in high rollover risk for

This is due in large part to an assumption of
continued negative real interest rates on public
debt financing, with captive demand for domestic
debt and concessional terms for part of the external
debt.

Roughly a quarter of Pakistan’s exports go to
Europe—a 20 percent decline in exports to Europe,
for example, sustained over a year, would amount
to a loss of about 10 percent of reserves.
Remittances are another potential channel, but
direct exposure to Europe is not very large. (Only
15 percent of remittances come from Europe, three
quarters of which from the United Kingdom.)
However, to the extent developments in Europe
affect oil prices and the Middle East—which
accounts for nearly 60 percent of Pakistan’s
remittances—there could be sizeable knock-on
effects to remittances.

profitable on account of wide banking
sector spreads. However, banks’ balance
sheets are becoming increasingly
exposed to deteriorating private assets
as evidenced by rising NPLs (gross NPLs
were 16.7 percent of total loans at endSeptember 2011) and to sovereign risk.
High NPLs are an issue especially for
public sector and specialized banks that
lend to the agriculture and
manufacturing sectors. One large public
bank and two specialized banks are
being restructured but delays in
returning problem banks to minimum
capital requirements pose a risk for the
system.9 Finally, governance at some
public financial institutions has been

revenue and expenditure measures (see
below). Over the medium term, tax policy,
energy, business climate, and other
structural reforms—along the lines
previously discussed with the authorities in
the context of the SBA—should enable
further fiscal consolidation and higher
productivity. The scenario assumes much
less bank financing of the fiscal deficit and
less crowding out of private credit. Together,
these policies and reforms would produce
higher growth, lower unemployment and
inflation, and a more robust reserve cover
(see text table and Figure 6).

22.
An alternative reform scenario
illustrates the benefits of adjustment. In
such a scenario, the authorities are assumed
to implement prudent fiscal and monetary
policies and structural reforms. In particular,
the 2011/12 fiscal deficit would be cut to
5.7 percent of GDP using a combination of

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Policy discussions focused on upfront policy actions needed to strengthen macroeconomic and
financial stability and on structural reforms to lift medium-term growth.
23.
Broadly speaking, there was little
disagreement between the authorities
and staff on the diagnosis of the
economic situation and on policy
priorities. Both sides agreed that political
constraints to reform had been binding for
some time. Staff cautioned that the
authorities’ policy mix was leading the
economy down an unsustainable and risky
path: high fiscal deficits were crowding out
the private sector and hurting growth,
monetary policy was accommodating the
deficits and keeping inflation high, while
the external position was deteriorating
significantly, in part reflecting global

A.

Fiscal Policy

24.
Pakistan’s fiscal deficit has risen. The
general government deficit (excluding grants)
reached 6.6 percent of GDP in 2010/11, the
highest level since the 2008 crisis.10 Tax
revenue collections again failed to pick up (in
fact they declined slightly as a percent of GDP),
as tax reform foundered due to insufficient
political support. At the same time, although
total spending declined by 1¼ percent of GDP,
high spending on subsidies, security, and
interest, as well as a 15 percent salary increase,
crowded out more productive spending.
10

developments. Staff, therefore,
recommended a set of short-term measures
for dealing with the growing vulnerabilities.
The authorities acknowledged the risks in
the months ahead, but also noted some
mitigating factors, such as continued strong
remittances inflows and increased tax
collection in 2011/12. They nevertheless
agreed on the need to prepare a plan to
mitigate risks. Beyond the short term, there
was agreement on the importance of
putting together a homegrown reform
strategy for the next several years, based on
a broad consensus, with the objective of
raising inclusive growth.

This figure includes the recognition in the budget of
past electricity arrears (0.6 percent of GDP). Excluding
arrears, the deficit reached 6 percent of GDP,
marginally less than in the previous financial year.

Deficit financing shifted from external and
nonbank sources to bank financing (including
the SBP). So far in 2011/12 (July to September),
the fiscal deficit was 1.2 percent of GDP, lower
than the 1.5 percent of GDP deficit recorded in
the same period in 2010/11. Both low
expenditure growth and a brisk increase in tax
revenue contributed to the lower deficit.
However, strong tax revenue partly reflects
one-time factors; revenue collection could
weaken in the period ahead, particularly if the
government succumbs to pressures to reverse
the removal of tax exemptions and zero
ratings.

spending, including the reduction of nonpower subsidies (e.g., wheat, fertilizers); reintroducing the special excise duty and income
tax surcharge; and raising the sales tax rate. At
the same time, efforts should be made to
minimize the electricity subsidies and keep
provincial budgets in surplus.

25.
Reducing the fiscal deficit is central
to safeguarding macroeconomic stability
and setting the foundations for higher
growth. The authorities have tried to keep
spending under control, scaled back borrowing
from the SBP, and implemented some tax and
administrative reforms (see paragraph 29).
Nevertheless, staff cautioned that the
authorities’ deficit target of 4.7 percent of GDP
in 2011/12 appeared out of reach. While
commendable, the efforts to raise additional
revenue by means of stronger compliance
enforcement have thus far not yielded
adequate results. With electricity subsidies
likely to be higher than assumed by the
authorities and the assumed aggregate
provincial surplus likely to be lower, staff
argued that the deficit was heading for 7
percent of GDP, which would be difficult to
finance. Hence, there is a need for immediate
measures to contain the deficit, perhaps at 5.7
percent of GDP (5½ percent including grants).
This would be achievable and probably
sufficient to contain major fiscal risks.
26.
Staff proposed a set of measures to
build buffers and boost confidence, and cap
the 2011/12 deficit at 5.7 percent of GDP.
The government could use a combination of
spending and revenue measures that include:
tightening non-wage current government

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PAKISTAN

27.
In the medium term, further fiscal
adjustment is needed and should be based
on structural measures. With gradual deficit
reduction and continued low borrowing costs
(relative to inflation) over the medium term,
Pakistan’s public debt would be sustainable,
but the debt level is high, making it vulnerable
to interest rate or exchange rate shocks. In
addition, given financing constraints, lower
deficits would reduce crowding-out and make
more bank credit available for private-sector
investment. In order to achieve this objective, a
decisive break with the past is needed. A
substantial increase in tax revenue is a
necessary condition for sustainable deficit
reduction, and another attempt should be
made at implementing the reformed General
Sales Tax (GST). The effort to improve tax
administration and tax compliance will have to
continue unabated, but in terms of revenuegenerating capacity, they cannot yield as a
much as a broad-based integrated GST, which
could generate up to 3 percent of GDP in
additional tax revenue. The authorities could
also consider adopting a broader income tax
regime and property taxes. On the spending
side, the problems in the power sector and
loss-making PSEs will need to be resolved, to
remove these large drains on budgetary funds
and to make room for more productive uses of
public funds, especially for health, education,
and poverty alleviation through bettertargeted transfers, and to improve public
service delivery. Similarly, commodity
operations—the government’s program

PAKISTAN

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT AND POST-PROGRAM MONITORING

of commodity procurements (e.g., of wheat,
sugar, urea), which aims to stabilize the price
of commodities in the domestic market and is
financed by government-guaranteed bank
loans—should be phased out as they are
costly and divert bank credit away from the
private sector.11 Also, debt management,
aimed at gradually extending debt maturities,
will be particularly important in the period
ahead to reduce rollover and interest rate risks.
Finally, government cash management needs
to be strengthened, in the context of sizeable
government deposits in the banking system.
28.
Fiscal decentralization needs to be
managed carefully. If well managed, fiscal
decentralization could improve the delivery of
public goods and services. However, the large
devolution of revenue to the provinces with
more limited devolution of spending
responsibilities have left the federal budget in
a weaker structural position, make
achievement of general government fiscal
targets more difficult, and presents a risk to
fiscal stability. The provinces will need to raise
more of their own tax revenues, including
revenues from property and agriculture, while
at the same time improving the capacity to
manage their new spending responsibilities.
Greater clarity in the assignment of
responsibilities at different levels of
government is needed to strengthen
accountability.
Authorities’ Views
29.
The authorities are well aware of the
harmful effects of large budget deficits.
Hence, they expressed their determination to

achieve the 4.7 percent of GDP deficit target
for this year. The authorities believed that the
targeted deficit reduction could be achieved
with a combination of spending restraint,
carryover effects of last fiscal year’s measures
to broaden the tax base by removing
exemptions and zero ratings, collection of past
due taxes, and measures to improve tax
administration and tax compliance. Regarding
the latter, the authorities have used risk-based
tax audits and implemented a campaign to
identify and bring into the tax net wealthy
individuals who do not pay taxes. On the
spending side, they plan to ensure that
nondiscretionary spending is kept within the
budget limit, and to strictly contain electricity
subsidies.
30.
The authorities plan to cut the
deficit to 3 percent of GDP over the
medium term and simplify the tax system.
Despite the resistance encountered on the
previous attempts, they intend to replace the
current general sales tax with a modern
integrated reformed sales tax. They plan to
continue the removal of remaining exemptions
and zero ratings, and simplify the tax system to
rely on three main pillars: sales tax, income tax,
and customs duties.
31.
The authorities recognize the risks
to the public finances arising from
decentralization. Nonetheless, they were
confident that provinces would remain in
surplus in 2011/12. They argued that the
provinces needed to make a stronger effort to
increase their own tax revenue—a view shared
by staff. The authorities expressed interest in
IMF technical assistance in this area.

The stock of commodity credits currently stands at
1½ percent of GDP.

B.

Financial Policies

32.
Monetary policy has accommodated
fiscal deficits. The SBP has adopted an
expansionary monetary policy stance in the
past few months. In its first two Board
meetings during 2011/12 (July and September
2011), the SBP cut its policy rate by a
cumulative 200 basis points to 12 percent, with
interbank market rates also falling. At the same
time, SBP lending to the budget has declined
since May 2011, helped by an increase in
liquidity injections by the SBP via open market
operations to allow banks to purchase
government paper (Figure 3). Reserve money
growth has moderated, reflecting a decline in
central bank net foreign assets, which have
fallen in part due to the SBP’s unsterilized
intervention to support the rupee.
33.
Given the inflation and external
risks, a more cautious monetary policy is
needed. Staff argued that the SBP’s decision
to reduce its policy rate was overly aggressive
given the still-uncertain inflation outlook and
the weakening of the external position, and
that through its liquidity injections it was
accommodating high fiscal deficits. Despite
some moderation in headline CPI inflation in
recent months, significant inflationary risks
remain and core inflation remains high.
34.
Allowing more flexibility in the
exchange rate is necessary to protect the
external position. The authorities have
recently allowed more exchange rate flexibility,
and as a result Pakistan’s de facto exchange
rate arrangement has recently been
reclassified by the Fund as “floating.” However,
staff noted that recent reserve losses had been
sizeable and that the exchange rate had not
been allowed to move much, considering
strong market pressures. Staff, therefore,

20

PAKISTAN

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

argued that the SBP should allow more
flexibility during phases of depreciation
pressures, while building reserves during
phases of appreciation pressures.
35.
Strengthening central bank
autonomy and increasing monetary policy
effectiveness should aid in achieving
sustained disinflation. The current legal
structure, especially the absence of a strong
framework for direct government financing,
significantly impairs central bank
independence. The legal reforms to increase
SBP independence are critical, but the draft
amendments currently being discussed in
parliament do not meet this objective in that
they do not ensure the operational
independence of the SBP. In addition,
increasing financial deepening by fostering
competition in the banking sector and
improving the functioning of financial markets
are important for strengthening monetary
policy effectiveness.
36.
Safeguarding financial stability in
the face of rising risks is critical. While
systemwide capital adequacy levels are
reasonably strong, capital ratios mask bank
vulnerabilities arising from rising NPLs and
large holdings of government securities.12 Staff,
therefore, urged steps to help address NPLs
and also strengthen bank supervision while
limiting regulatory forbearance. Staff stressed
that problem banks should be restructured
promptly, prudential regulations applied
uniformly across institutions, and financial

governance addressed in those institutions
where it is a problem. Staff also recommended
passing legislation for explicit deposit
insurance, which has been prepared, possibly
financed by levies on banks. Finally, the
authorities should initiate the establishment of
commercial courts to speed up the recovery of
loans in default.
37.
Development of capital markets
should also be a priority. This would allow
corporations to access credit from nonbank
financial institutions and help support broad
growth objectives. To this end, the authorities
should encourage the development of the
managed funds industry, and push for greater
transparency in company data, particularly for
unlisted subsidiaries of listed companies,
which will help boost public confidence in
capital markets.
Authorities’ Views
38.
The SBP felt that the recent cuts in
interest rates were needed to stimulate
growth. Furthermore, the SBP questioned
whether higher interest rates would help in an
environment of fiscal dominance. They argued
that the September spike in exchange rate
pressures was temporary and SBP intervention
was necessary to calm the market. The SBP
also agreed that inflationary risks remain and
stressed that reducing the fiscal deficit was
key. The SBP stressed that it was prepared to
raise the policy rate if needed. Recognizing
increased macroeconomic risks, including
those arising from fiscal weaknesses and
falling foreign exchange inflows, SBP opted at
its November monetary policy meeting to
keep its policy rate unchanged.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT AND POST-PROGRAM MONITORING

39.
The authorities stressed they would
continue to monitor NPLs closely and
strengthen credit assessment procedures in
order to protect banks’ capital positions.
They noted that they were taking steps to
minimize the risks associated with delays in
restructuring problem banks, including the
recent capital injection of Rs 8 billion to a
public bank (with Rs 256 billion in assets),
bringing the total capital support from public
funds to Rs 17 billion since 2008. The
authorities also agree that in order to maintain
capacity for private-sector credit while
government borrowing is on the rise, banks
will need to continue mobilizing deposits at a
rapid pace. They also agreed that capital
market development, particularly for corporate
debt markets, is a priority. Overall, they were
receptive to staff’s proposals for safeguarding
the financial sector, and expressed interest in
related technical assistance.
40.
The authorities outlined their plans
for capital market development. They intend
to promote depth and liquidity of equity and
debt markets, for example, via better
transparency in margin financing and debt
pricing information. They expect to improve
surveillance of company activities by
strengthening real-time data monitoring
capabilities. In addition, growth of the
managed funds industry will be encouraged, in
part, by product innovation, for example,
exchange traded funds. There are also plans
for the introduction of new debt and
commodity hedging instruments, as
exemplified by the new wheat futures contract.

Structural Reforms

41.
Sustained and inclusive growth
requires a number of structural reforms.
Staff pointed out that a national consensus on
structural reform was needed to raise
productivity and competitiveness and lift
constraints on growth. As was also confirmed
by a seminar at the end of the mission (Box 4),
there is little disagreement about the types of
reform that are needed, but implementation
has been lacking, reflecting a lack of broad
political ownership. Improving the reliability
and efficiency of Pakistan’s energy supply
remains the key priority on the structural
reform agenda. Energy reform would also have
important complementarities by unburdening
the public finances. The authorities said they
were committed to vigorously pursuing energy
sector reform. To this end, the government has
substantially raised domestic petroleum and
electricity prices. This is necessary given higher
international prices, but a management
overhaul to reduce the high technical and
collection losses and strengthen bill collection
is arguably even more important. Staff stressed
that a strategy, which could include
privatization, was also needed to restructure
the large loss-making PSEs. In this connection,
a program of divesting public stakes in banks
is also necessary to further reduce the state’s
footprint in the economy. Further, to boost
productivity and spur entrepreneurship and
innovation, staff underlined the need to
improve the investment climate, by promoting
better regulation and governance and
facilitating the entry and exit of firms. Civil
service reform is also necessary to improve the

22

PAKISTAN

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

delivery of public services, which is under
strain from low tax collection and stepped-up
fiscal decentralization. Given the difficult
situation in the labor market, staff noted that
Pakistan needs sustained and inclusive growth
and improved human capital to meet its large
employment challenge. Improving the
functioning of the financial sector to channel
savings to borrowers is also critical, as is
raising companies’ access to capital markets.
These reforms should be complemented by a
further strengthening of the social safety net
to support vulnerable parts of the population.
42.
The authorities continue to pursue
trade liberalization, which should help
diversify exports. The mission welcomed
Pakistan’s recent moves to strengthen regional
trade ties, in particular the recent efforts to
continue trade normalization with India, which
promises to revive commercial ties that have
largely been dormant since 1947. In particular,
Pakistan will introduce a “negative list” of
imports from India by February 2012, which
will replace the current “positive list.”
Furthermore, the “negative list” will be phased
out gradually over time. Moreover, both
Pakistan and India have agreed to move
toward enhancing preferential trading
arrangements under the South Asian Free
Trade Agreement (SAFTA). Pakistan and India
have also agreed to remove impediments to
bilateral investments and opening bank
branches. Finally, to promote trade, the SBP
has recently signed bilateral currency swap
agreements with the People’s Bank of China
and the Central Bank of Turkey.

Box 4. Seminar on Reviving Growth in Pakistan
Pakistan’s Ministry of Finance and the Fund co-hosted a seminar on the revival of economic growth
in Pakistan.1 The seminar provided an opportunity to hear the views of Pakistani stakeholders. The
discussion confirmed a broad consensus on key short-term and medium-term constraints and made
recommendations that were mostly in line with the staff’s views. Short-term constraints cited included
water resources, energy shortages, security issues, and fiscal and external vulnerabilities. Medium-term
constraints included the absence of a strong policy framework, policy inconsistency, weak institutions, and
inadequate ownership of reform by the political leadership. Specific recommended measures included a
more competitive exchange rate, better governance to support higher savings and investment, stronger
public finances, energy sector reforms, and a deeper financial sector with more competition and greater
inclusion.

1

The seminar took place in Islamabad on November 19th, 2011. Participants included former government
officials, members of Pakistani academia, civil society, parliament, and the private sector (corporate and financial),
and representatives of development partners.

OTHER ISSUES
43.
The anti-money laundering and
combating the financing of terrorism
(AML/CFT) regime in Pakistan needs to
be improved. Pakistan’s AML/CFT assessment
in 2009 highlighted a number of important
deficiencies many of which have yet to be
addressed. The authorities should effectively
regulate money service providers through an
appropriate sanctions regime, and increase
the range of ML/FT preventive measures
applicable to them. Other major deficiencies
include the lack of adequate criminalization
and effective implementation of sanctions
against terrorist financing, and the absence
of effective controls for cross-border cash
transactions. The authorities have recently
stepped up their efforts to enforce AML/CFT
regulations, including by instructing foreign
exchange companies to comply with the
requirements of the AML/CFT regime.
44.
In accordance with Fund policy,
the Managing Director recommends the
initiation of Post-Program Monitoring
(PPM). Outstanding Fund credit to Pakistan
exceeds the 200 percent of quota threshold
for PPM, and there are no exceptional
circumstances that would indicate that PPM is
not warranted. The first PPM Board discussion
is envisaged in mid-2012. In addition, Pakistan
is an exceptional access borrower from the
Fund and, therefore, an Ex-Post Evaluation
(EPE) has begun, and a report will be
produced for the Board.

24

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

45.
Data quality. Macroeconomic
statistics are broadly adequate for
surveillance, but there are important gaps in
the real sector and the quality of fiscal and
social (especially poverty) data needs
strengthening. The authorities are committed
to strengthening data quality in order to
better inform policy decisions and monitor
outcomes. Indeed, the authorities have
recently stepped up efforts toward joining the
Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS).

PAKISTAN

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT AND POST-PROGRAM MONITORING

STAFF APPRAISAL
46.
Without a fundamental policy
correction, it will be difficult for Pakistan
to maintain macroeconomic stability,
raise living standards, and durably reduce
poverty. In such a scenario of unchanged
policies, marked by high fiscal deficits,
accommodative monetary conditions, and
structural reform stasis, growth would
remain subpar, inflation excessive, reserves
too low, and social indicators disappointing.
47.
The risks to the outlook are tilted
to the downside and contingency
planning is needed. The recent
deterioration in Pakistan’s external position
highlights the macroeconomic risks, with
looming pressures on the balance of
payments from lower export prices, weaker
growth in remittances, and repayments to
the Fund. Policy space to deal with any
further adverse shocks is limited. In addition
to security problems and the risk of policy
slippage in an election year, the
government’s high roll over needs, lowerthan-expected external financial inflows,
negative spillovers from the turmoil in
Europe, and the high level of NPLs in the
banking sector all represent significant risks
to economic and financial stability. In view
of the risks, the authorities should prepare
and implement a plan to mitigate
vulnerabilities.
48.
Pakistan’s fundamental problems
are well known. Governance and
institutional problems undermine the
country’s fiscal position. The complexity
of fiscal management has recently been
compounded by fiscal decentralization.

Unpredictable and widespread power
outages are stifling growth. Power sector
subsidies, which are poorly targeted, have
squeezed out social spending. Large public
sector enterprises with soft budget
constraints continue to sap fiscal resources,
as do the government’s commodity
operations. Meanwhile, interenterprise
arrears in the energy sector (“circular debt”)
undermine budget discipline and are
clogging up the financial system. Financial
intermediation to the private sector has
declined to low levels, with the banking
system supplying more credit to the public
than to the private sector.
49.
The solutions to these problems,
however, require politically difficult
decisions. The authorities recognize that
Pakistan’s macroeconomic problems have
microeconomic and institutional causes that
need to be addressed to achieve higher,
inclusive growth. A fundamental break with
the past is needed, and this will require a
national consensus on a strategy to revive
economic growth, along the lines of the
NGS.
50.
Consolidation of the public
finances is the starting point in any effort
to set the economy on the right course.
Staff welcomes the authorities’ efforts to
remove tax exemptions and zero ratings,
including in the sensitive agriculture sector.
However, a more sizeable increase in tax
revenue is needed. Measures could include
a reformed GST, a broader income tax
regime, introducing a property tax, reintroducing the special excise duty and

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

25

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT AND POST-PROGRAM MONITORING

income tax surcharge, or raising the sales
tax rate. On the spending side, it is critical
to tighten non-wage current spending,
especially by reducing untargeted subsidies,
while protecting social spending. Lossmaking public sector enterprises needed to
be restructured, and commodity operations
should be scaled back and phased out.
Given substantial rollover risks of domestic
government debt, carefully managing the
government’s growing debt load through
extending maturities is also a priority. In
addition, some of the rules of the game for
fiscal decentralization, for instance those
relating to provincial borrowing, need to be
clarified, and the incentives of the provinces
to raise their own revenue should be better
aligned with requirements of sound public
finances.
51.
Monetary and exchange rate
policy needs to better contain inflation
and external risks. At its November 2011
policy meeting, the SBP rightly decided to
keep its policy rate unchanged. Any further
contemplation of monetary policy loosening
should await clearer disinflation signals, and
the SBP should be ready to tighten policy if
inflation or external pressure increases.
Greater exchange rate flexibility is also
called for to facilitate external adjustment
and to safeguard foreign reserves, which
are projected to decline. Based on standard
analysis, staff considers the rupee to be
somewhat overvalued relative to
fundamentals. However, declining reserves,
strains in global financial markets, and
commodity price variability suggest there is
considerable uncertainty about the extent
of overvaluation.

26

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PAKISTAN

52.
Reducing inflation will require
comprehensive fiscal reforms and greater
central bank independence. Fiscal
consolidation would free monetary policy to
pursue inflation objectives. A more
independent central bank would be better
able to resist pressures to finance the
government deficit, either directly or
indirectly. And lower inflation would help
the poor.
53.
Although capital adequacy ratios
remain strong, increasing NPLs present
risks to financial stability as do high
concentrations of bank assets in
government securities. Action is needed
to address the NPLs and bank supervision
should be strengthened. Remaining
problem banks need to be resolved without
delay. Closely monitoring vulnerabilities
should remain a key priority, as should
addressing financial governance problems in
some institutions. In addition, establishing
an explicit deposit insurance mechanism
would boost confidence in the banking
sector. Finally, the sector would benefit from
a simplification of the collateral recovery
process. A stronger financial sector, coupled
with less government borrowing, would
provide the resources for needed
investment by the private sector.
54.
In sum, Pakistan has the potential
to do much better. Pakistan needs
sustained higher and inclusive growth to
reduce poverty and meet its large
employment challenge. Growth prospects
hinge on improving the policy mix and
relieving infrastructural bottlenecks,
especially in the energy sector,
strengthening human capital, and ensuring

PAKISTAN

a competitive business environment. In
designing its reform strategy, the
government will need to maintain a robust
social safety net to support vulnerable parts
of the population.

Appendix 1. Fiscal Decentralization in Pakistan: Too Much, Too Fast?1
The 7th National Finance Commission (NFC)1
Award and the passage of the 18th
Constitutional Amendment represent a major
step towards transferring more funds and
spending responsibilities to the provinces.
This stepped-up move to fiscal
decentralization is happening at a time when
Pakistan is struggling with bringing fiscal
deficits under control, and if not wellmanaged, it could seriously complicate this
effort. Similarly, the effort to improve the
quality of public services could be
compromised. Therefore, it is of key
importance to get the design of the system
of intra-governmental relationships right.

57.5 percent in 2011/12 and thereafter.
Other transfers to the provinces (straight
transfers, special grants) were also increased
sharply in 2010/11 (Table 1). The share of
transfers to the provinces in total federal tax
collection has almost doubled (Figure 1). In
addition to population size (82 percent),
new criteria for determining the share of the
provinces were added under the 7th NFC
Award: poverty (10.3 percent), revenue
collection (5 percent), and inverse
population density (2.7 percent); the share
of the poorest province Baluchistan almost
doubled, with corresponding reduction in
the share of Punjab.

NFC Awards and 18th Constitutional
Amendment
Pakistan has been a federation since the
adoption of the 1973 Constitution, which
also created the Council of Common Interest
(CCI) to deal with disputes between the
center and the provinces. The National
Finance Commission (NFC) was set up to
determine the common pool of resources
from federal tax receipts, and to distribute
these resources under so-called Awards.2
The most recent 7th NFC Award agreed in
2009 represents a major step toward fiscal
decentralization. The share of the divisible
pool of resources allocated to the provinces
has increased from 47 percent in 2008/09 to
56 percent in 2010/11 (65 percent of total
FBR tax collection in that year), and to

The common or divisible pool of resources

that provincial governments’ borrowing in
domestic or international markets is subject
to limits and conditions specified by the
National Economic Council (NEC). Thus, any
province that may want to borrow will have
to make a case for such borrowing to the
NEC.

Benefits and Risks of Fiscal
Decentralization
While fiscal decentralization can improve the
quality of provided services, it can also pose
risks to macroeconomic stability. Therefore,
a number of preconditions for successful
decentralization have been laid out in the
literature. Ideally, decentralization would
start with a clear assignment of
responsibilities at different levels of
government, and proceed at a speed
corresponding to the implementation of
necessary preconditions. However, in
Pakistan, political considerations have been
an important driving force behind fiscal
decentralization, and as a result, the risks
and costs of decentralization may have been
underestimated. A too-extensive, too-fast or
badly managed fiscal decentralization
carries several risks:
First, extensive decentralization limits the
ability of the center to conduct countercyclical stabilization policies. If the federal
government controls only a limited share of

Monetary Fund), Fedelino, A. and T. Ter-Minassian,

Occasional Paper No. 271.



Some argue that decentralization could accelerate
the putting in place of these conditions. For
example, giving local governments more autonomy
would accelerate the learning-by-doing and
strengthen local capacity—see Usui, 2007.

spending, or if it does not control an
important tax instrument, its ability to use
discretionary fiscal policy could be seriously
limited. If the central government raises
taxes or boosts tax collection by improving
tax administration and tax compliance, a
significant portion of additional revenue
may need to be transferred to the provinces
where it could be spent, rather than used to
reduce the deficit. This could be especially
problematic when fiscal vulnerability calls
for sizable fiscal adjustment, as is the case in
Pakistan.
Second, the large dependence of the
provinces on shared revenues and
transfers from federal government can
create incentive problems. As most of their
spending is covered by funds received from
the federal government, the provinces face
little incentive to raise revenue to finance
their spending. The beneficiaries of
provincial spending face little, if any, of the
costs of financing this spending, and thus
have less incentive to pressure the local
governments to economize on spending or
collect more revenue. This could lead to
overspending, low revenue and weaker fiscal
balance. Federal government, too, may have
little incentive to raise more revenue: if it
keeps only part of the collected taxes, it
receives lesser benefits, while incurring
political and other costs of collection.
Third, unsynchronized and unbalanced
devolution of funds and spending
responsibilities to the provinces could
exacerbate the fiscal strains. The
devolution of resources to the provinces
under the 7th NFC Award preceded the
devolution of spending. In addition, the
amount of additional devolved resources to
the provinces, estimated at about Rs
200 billion, was higher than the amount of

PAKISTAN

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT AND POST-PROGRAM MONITORING

devolved spending, estimated at Rs 67–
Rs 91 billion. To avoid weakening of the
general government balance, the federal
government successfully pressed the
provinces to keep their 2010/11 budgets in
surplus. The pressure on the federal budget
from the unbalanced devolution of funds
and spending continues in 2011/12, and the
provinces are again asked to run aggregate
surplus, even as provincial parliaments have
approved provincial budgets that in
aggregate show a small deficit (Figure 4).

Fourth, rapid augmentation of resources
allocated to the provinces could stretch
their ability to spend these effectively. A
too fast devolution carries the risk of future
disruption of services in key areas such as
health and food. The absence at the
provincial level of well-developed
expenditure control systems and public
finance management adds to the risk of
misallocation and waste, and, consequently,
to a failure to reach the objectives of
devolution—improved provision of public
goods and services.

Ghaus-Pasha, A. (2011).

However, following the example of the federal
government, provinces introduced a sizable salary
increase in FY 2010/11, which absorbed a large
share of additionally transferred revenue.

Fifth, fast and poorly designed
decentralization could result in
increased—perceived or actual—regional
inequality. Such an outcome, together with
a failure to achieve improved
macroeconomic performance and better
provision of public goods and services,
would complicate policy cooperation and
coordination between the central
government and the provinces. As a result,
the effort to bring the provinces on board in
order to restore fiscal sustainability would
suffer. In sum, the rapid and far-reaching
fiscal decentralization in Pakistan carries
with it many risks and pitfalls that could
complicate macroeconomic management
and adversely affect economic performance,
while failing to improve the delivery of
services and reduce fiscal inequality among
the provinces.

How Can Decentralization Work Better
in Pakistan?
Making decentralization work is a key
precondition for improving fiscal outcomes
and mitigating risks to fiscal sustainability.
Pakistan’s stepped-up fiscal decentralization
is taking place in a time of significant fiscal
challenges, further underscoring the need
for prudent fiscal behavior on the part of
both the federal government and the
provinces. The following are the key issues
that need to be addressed:
First, fiscal decentralization and revenue
sharing with the provinces should not
weaken the federal government’s ability
to reduce the fiscal deficit and public
debt. Very low tax collection in Pakistan,
and the limited scope for sustained
spending cuts imply that revenue
mobilization will have to play a key role in
restoring fiscal stability and ensuring that
decentralization produces better service

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

delivery. Therefore, it is important that the
federal government be able to use
additional revenue resulting from tax
measures or improvements in tax
administration and enforcement to reduce
the deficit. If the preponderance of
additional tax revenue were to accrue to the
divisible pool of resources and eventually be
spent by the provinces, instead of being
used to reduce the deficit, the federal
government would have both less incentive
and less ability to undertake fiscal
consolidation.
Avoiding this risk could require a
modification of the rules governing the
divisible pool. An option would be to apply,
at the margin, a lower provincial share of the
pool; for example, when the growth of the
pool exceeds a specified floor (say, nominal
GDP growth). A more rigorous and perhaps
more stable version of this approach would
be to define the provincial receipts from the
pool—not as a share—but as a “fixed”
nominal amount that is indexed annually
with a relevant price index. This “cap” on
how much provinces receive from the pool
could stay in place until the general
government deficit is reduced to a certain
level, e.g., to government’s medium-term
target of 3 percent of GDP.
Second, given their large share in total
government spending, the provinces
need to play their part in supporting
sound fiscal policy. To that effect, it is
important that the provinces significantly
improve their own revenue collection, and
continue avoiding irresponsible borrowing.

Denmark to regulate the size of general grants to

At about 0.5 percent of GDP, provincial
own revenue is very low. There are several
reasons for this (Bahl et al., 2008):
(i) provincial taxable capacity is low and the
tax base is hard to reach (rural and informal
sectors are large); (ii) provinces have a
limited administrative capacity; (iii) the tax
base is reduced as a result of exemptions
and preferential treatment; and (iv) political
considerations prevent pressure on property
owners and other potential taxpayers to pay
taxes. There are several areas with potential
to bring in additional revenue to the
provinces, including: (i) GST on services—
though the potential varies significantly
among the provinces; (ii) agriculture income
tax; and (iii) strengthening of tax on
immoveable property.10 Moreover, the
failure to implement the reformed GST,
which was seen as key to the success of
devolution of spending responsibilities to
provinces, also does not help the effort to
raise additional provincial revenue.11
At the same time, provincial borrowing
needs to be tightly controlled. As noted,
Pakistan’s Constitution requires that
borrowing provinces seek National
Economic Council’s approval. This is a step
in the right direction, and needs to be firmly
observed. Control of provincial borrowing
should cover not only borrowing in
domestic and international markets, but also

No. 08–07, (Atlanta: Georgia State University).

Pakistan’s experience with the reform of the GST
confirms the observation that a decentralized fiscal
structure often becomes a major impediment to tax
reform because of the difficulty of coordination
among independent jurisdictions. See Tanzi, V.,
2002, “Pitfalls on the Road to Decentralization,”
In E. Ahmad and V. Tanzi, (eds), Managing Fiscal
Decentralization, (London, New York; Routledge).

domestic bank borrowing, including
borrowing from the central bank and
particularly from the provincial banks which
could become a captive source of financing.
One possibility would be to introduce the
provincial equivalent of the 2005 federal
Fiscal Responsibility and Debt Limitation Act
(Ghaus-Pasha 2011). An attractive option
would be a borrowing rule that would link
the permitted amount of provincial
borrowing to their tax and nontax revenue.
In the near term, provincial borrowing is
not on the agenda. Rather, reflecting the
above-noted asymmetric transfer of funds
and spending responsibilities, the provinces
are likely to be required to run temporary
surpluses to help limit the general
government deficit. To achieve provincial
surpluses would require a cooperative
agreement between the federal government
and the provinces. A variety of international
experience is available with regard to the
arrangements that different countries have
put in place to ensure conformity between
sub-national policies and macroeconomic
objectives. Some success has been achieved
in Nordic countries with a cooperative
approach that builds on annual negotiations
between local government associations and
the national government.12 In Pakistan, such
cooperation could be promoted under the
umbrella of the CCI. The Council’s role as an
institutional mechanism for resolving
conflicts has been strengthened as a result
of the 18th Amendment, and it could play an
important role.

not be optimal if a reasonable level of
general government deficit should
require the provinces to run surpluses, to
compensate for large federal government
deficits. Rather, the provinces should run
broadly balanced budgets, with eventual
borrowing limited to financing high-return
investment projects.13 Mobilization of
additional revenue by the provinces could
then be used to further improve the delivery
of services and financing of growthenhancing infrastructure investment.
Finally, to reduce the risk that the
decentralization would weaken the
quality of service delivery, the capacity of
the provinces to manage effectively
increased spending responsibilities needs
to be beefed up. Two key prerequisites
need to be met: strong accountability of
service providers and policymakers, and
administrative capacity to handle the new
spending responsibilities effectively.
Accountability has been identified as key
condition for efficient delivery.14 Reducing
the overlap of spending responsibilities and
assigning clear responsibility for the
provision of public goods and services at
different levels of government are two
important priorities. The third priority is to
strengthen data provision on provincial

13

However, to prevent a weakening of the general
government balance, the move of provincial
budgets from a surplus to a balance would require
a corresponding structural improvement in the
federal budget.

spending.15 The lack of functional
classification data and data on actual—as
compared to budgeted—spending makes it
more difficult to assess the implementation
of the budget and compare the spending
and “outcomes” of spending among
jurisdiction. Better data availability and
reporting would improve the ability of the
electorate to held provincial officials more
accountable.

Conclusion
The stepped-up fiscal decentralization as a
result of the 7th NFC Award and the
18th Constitution Amendment provides
additional significant resources and
responsibilities to the provinces and, if well
managed, has the potential to improve the
delivery of public goods and services.
However, as a result of persistent weakness
in tax collection and spending pressures,
Pakistan’s fiscal vulnerability is high and

needs to be addressed urgently. This task
has been made more difficult as a result of
the large and unbalanced devolution of
funds and spending responsibilities to the
provinces which left the federal budget in
a weaker structural position. Therefore,
substantial strengthening of fiscal discipline
at both the federal and the provincial levels
is crucial for restoring fiscal sustainability.
Without stronger tax revenue and sounder
public finance, the decentralization is
unlikely to deliver the expected benefits. At
the same time, a clear assignment of
responsibilities at different levels of
government and better provision of data on
budget implementation are needed to
strengthen accountability and the quality of
service delivery.

Appendix 2. Financial Sector Competition1

Banking sector spreads between lending
and deposit rates are relatively wide on a
cross-country basis. Averaging more than
650 bps for the overall banking sector over
a two-year period through September 2011,
the spread is relatively wide compared with
the median for a large number of countries
for which data are available (Figure 1).
Although this spread has generally
increased in recent years, it has come down
sharply during 2011 after 200 bps of policy
rate cuts (Figure 2). The existence of a
relatively wide spread has prompted
allegations that banks are charging
excessive rates for lending.

The financial sector in Pakistan is dominated1
by banks. Developing the nonbank sector and
capital markets could have several favorable
outcomes for the overall economy. A greater
variety of savings instruments could help
stimulate domestic savings, which would
expand sources of credit available to the
private sector. A well-developed financial
sector could also help transfer asset risk away
from bank balance sheets to investors willing
to bear it for the sake of commensurate
return. The authorities are encouraged to
lower barriers to the development of capital
markets, especially from national savings
instruments, and to continue to improve
transparency of information in both equity
and debt markets. Further progress in the
development of commodities markets,
particularly in the agricultural sector, could
help producers hedge price risk and
contribute to greater stability of banking
sector deposits.

Sources: State Bank of Pakistan; and IMF FSI (Q4 2011).

Relatively wide banking sector spreads
could reflect lack of competition within
the financial sector. A wide spread might
be the result of low deposit rates, high
lending rates, or both. Low deposit rates
may be explained in two ways. First, deposits
are mainly held with banks for transactional
purposes while savings are invested in the
National Savings Scheme (NSS). Second,
limited competition in rural areas and small
towns means that banks can offer the legal
minimum deposit rate of 5 percent per year
and still attract deposits. On the lending
side, rates might be high because
corporations are forced to borrow from
banks in the absence of capital markets
financing and because there are high risk
premia associated with corporate
governance and transparency issues.
Separately, recent empirical work suggests
that the present composition of bank
balance sheets, with rising holdings of
government securities and a large share of
rate-insensitive deposits, might be driving
the wide banking sector spread.2

Increased competition with banks could
help to lower spreads. At present,
alternatives to bank deposits for savings are
the following:


the NSS;



managed funds ;



direct holdings of equities and
bonds (via brokers); and,



investment products offered by
insurance companies.

The NSS is an attractive alternative to
bank deposits but may be hurting the
development of capital markets. As of
October 2011, the profit rate on the NSS is
set at 12.4 percent for a term of six months.3
There is no upper limit on investment, no
management fee, no redemption penalty,
and no tax implication. It is not surprising
that the overall size of the schemes is almost
one-fourth that of bank deposits.4 In the

As of October 2011, mandatory rates of return are:
Special Saving Certificate, 12.4 percent; Regular
Income Certificate, 12.6 per cent; Defense Saving
Certificate, 12.7 per cent; and Bahbood Saving
Certificate, 14.4 per cent. Further details are
available from http://www.savings.gov.pk

Banking sector deposits, excluding interbank
balances, are Rs 5.2 trillion (about one-quarter
of GDP).

Managed funds are an alternative to the
NSS but face several challenges to
growth. At present, these have assets of
only one-fifth the NSS, so there is scope for
future growth, which could support capital
markets development. However, there are
several challenges. First, managed funds find
it difficult to compete with the NSS in
performance after fees and liquidity because
performance varies considerably across
funds and fees are high at 1-3 percent.
Second, the pension system in Pakistan is
fragmented and mostly unfunded (pay-asyou-go), which means that it does not
provide a significant investor base for
managed funds as in other countries.5 Third,
the closure of the stock market during
August through December 2008 led to the
failures of many funds and a loss of investor
confidence, particularly since a number of
lawsuits are stuck in courts in the absence of
tribunals administered by the Securities and
Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP)6.
Finally, managed funds are subject to the

Funded corporate schemes are estimated at
Rs 200 billion (US$2.4 billion); while, recently
initiated public schemes amount to Rs 1.3 billion
(US$15.5 million).

The market fell by more than 40 percent when it
reopened in December 2008 and was down
70 percent between mid-April 2008 and endJanuary 2009. Problems were experienced not just
by equity funds but by fixed income funds as well.
This was attributed to liquidity problems, owing to
the lack of collateral that could be priced by the
market.

Despite some advantages, there are
several hurdles to direct investment in
equity markets. On the positive side, the
listed market is deep and liquid, with a
capitalization of Rs 3.3 trillion (24 percent of
GDP); and it has appreciated significantly, by
about 130 percent over a two-year period
through November 2011. Also, capital gains
taxes on equity investments are relatively
low.7 On the other hand, despite regular
filing requirements, there is still a problem
with transparency of listed company
information, and there are market concerns
that shareholder funds from listed
companies may be directed to unlisted
affiliates.8 In addition, changes to the
7

Capital gains taxes are 10 percent for holding
periods less than six months, 7.5 percent for six
months to one year; and none for more than one
year.

8

Compared with only 651 listed companies, there
are some 10,000 unlisted companies, with assets of
more than Rs 7.5 million. Of these companies only a
small number are providing filing information to the
SECP, much of it rudimentary and incomplete. The
SECP says that it has limited capacity to perform
adequate supervision of the unlisted market.

“badla” system of informal margin financing
are in the process of being finalized. It is
important that the new rules provide
adequate safeguards to investors and
brokers, in light of the losses suffered in
2008 when the market was closed for four
months.
The domestic debt market suffers from
limited activity. On the demand side, banks
would rather buy government than
corporate debt because of favorable impact
on capital and liquidity positions and there
are few significant institutional buyers. From
a supply perspective, corporates prefer to
get financing from banks than from capital
markets since there are onerous listing and
reporting requirements for the latter.
Operational issues also affect market
liquidity. First, the bulk of corporate
issuance, which is listed on the Karachi Stock
Exchange (KSE), may only be traded by
Karachi brokers. Second, in the absence of
trading activity, reference prices for bonds
are artificially based on a “matrix approach,”
in which actual pricing data are interpolated
using rating and maturity as reference
criteria.9 However, the recent development
of an online bond trading system could
overcome some of these challenges, as it
offers a price-discovery mechanism and
reports trades in listed and unlisted bonds.

9

There are at least three problems with this
approach. First, it assumes that other characteristics
of bonds being priced (for example, coupon and
sector) are essentially the same as those of
reference bonds. Second, the credit risk premium,
which varies on an intra-day basis due to market
information on the creditor, is tied directly to a
much more stable rating measure for the bond.
Third, there are two agencies providing ratings on
corporate debt, and with different ratings it is
unclear which one should be used in the matrix.

The insurance industry, which could also
provide investment alternatives to bank
deposits, is relatively insignificant in size.
Altogether, the industry provides coverage
of Rs 87 billion (0.6 percent of GDP) and is
dominated by a state-owned life insurer.
Separately, the development of
commodities futures contracts could also
help lower banking sector spreads. Such
contracts could benefit hedgers reducing
the need for protective cash positions in
bank deposits. At present, the Pakistan
Mercantile Exchange (PME) has developed
futures contracts in two precious metals
(gold, silver); three agricultural products
(rice, palm oil, wheat); crude oil; and threemonth KIBOR. There are several challenges
to the future development of commodity
markets. First, there is a storage and delivery
problem for some agricultural contracts,
particularly for cotton and sugar. The PME is
exploring alternate solutions, for instance,
storing sugar at the mills where it is refined.
Second, it is difficult to get impartial grading
of reference commodities, and grading
vendors identified by the PME are not
always considered neutral by market
participants. Third, contracts based on local
definitions of weights and measures are not
as actively traded as those based on
international specifications. This is likely due
to comparability of pricing across markets
globally.



Improve transparency of company
information. Explore ways to improve
the quality of information on listed
companies to include links with unlisted
subsidiaries and strengthen supervision
in the area of unlisted companies.



Continue to improve transparency in
the pricing of debt instruments.
Strengthen processes for reporting
defaulted bonds to exchanges. Improve
the pricing mechanism for debt, in part,
by reducing reliance on a matrix system,
potentially by identifying specialized
market makers who could offer two-way
quotes.



Deepen the opportunity set for equity
investment. Encourage listed
companies to expand free float, and
explore ways to bring unlisted
companies into the listed market.



Establish regulations for equity
derivatives. The availability of options
and warrants in the market would help
corporates lower the cost of share
issuance, and allow investors to hedge
positions in the market more efficiently.



Allow cross-listing of bonds on
multiple exchanges. Allowing brokers
outside Karachi to transact in bonds
locally would help increase liquidity.

Encourage development of managed

Appendix 3. Creating Jobs for the Growing Labor Force1
Labor force participation in Pakistan is the1
lowest in the region, and agriculture is the
largest employer (Figure 1). Pakistan’s
population has grown by an average
2.2 percent per annum over the past decade,
and is estimated to amount to 177 million.2 Its
labor force was estimated to amount to
58 million in 2010/11; participation was
33 percent,3 which is very low compared to
45 percent for other South Asia countries and
over 50 percent for advanced economies.
Wide wage differentials and declining real
wages have marked the wage structure in
Pakistan in recent years. Labour Force Survey
2010/11 reports significant nominal wage
disparities by area and by gender. Average
nominal wages in urban areas exceed wages
in rural areas by one-third, reflecting the
higher share of urban employment in the
nonagricultural and formal sectors.
Furthermore, nominal wages have not kept
pace with the rise in inflation in past four
years, with real wages falling by an average
1.5 percent during 2007/08–2010/11.

Although there is a legal minimum wage, it is
not enforced across all sectors.4
While recorded unemployment is low, a
large part of the employed labor force is
unpaid, works less than 35 hours a week,
and works in the informal sector.5 The
unemployment rate is 6 percent (Figure 2).6
The young (under 24) and the older segments
(over 60) have the highest rates of
unemployment (10.2–11.9 percent).7 There are
indications that a large part of the employed
labor force could be available for alternative
or additional employment, i.e., were

The minimum wage was raised to Rs 7,000 per
month on May 1, 2010, but the Labour Force Survey
2010/11 indicates 30 percent of wage earners
received Rs 5,000 per month or less.
5

Data problems limit analysis of how much
unemployment and underemployment are cyclical,
but the floods in 2010 and 2011 and supply
constraints due to energy shortages over past years
suggest that cyclical unemployment and
underemployment may be on the rise.

underemployed.8 Of the employed, 28 percent
are unpaid family helpers and 10 percent of
the employed earned up to Rs 5,000 per
month, below the legal minimum. In terms of
hours worked, around 8.3 million or
15.1 percent of the total employed were
working less than 35 hours a week, a
1.7 percentage point increase since 2002. The
prevalence of unpaid helpers, wages below
the legal minimum, and people working less
than 35 hours per week suggests these
workers could be available for alternative or
additional work. Additionally, informal
employment is very high—accounting for
more than seven-tenths of the nonagricultural
employment in 2010/11—and has been on
the rise, indicating that more jobs have been
created in the informal sector. Moreover,
75 percent of informal workers were either in
unskilled occupations (18 percent) or lowskilled occupations (57 percent), suggesting
Pakistan’s economy needs major investments
in human capital and technology.

Underemployment accounts for employed workers
who during a specified period worked below their
desired capacity, whether in terms of reduced hours

Visibly or time-related underemployed are defined by
Pakistan Labor Force Survey as comprising of all
employed persons who worked less than 35 hours a
week and also sought or were available for alternative
or additional work.

A gender gap in the labor market persists
despite increased participation by women.
The labor force is 77 percent male and
23 percent female. Although the female
participation rate has increased, from
9.3 percent in 2000 to 15.6 percent in 2011, it
is less than one-third that of males in Pakistan
and the lowest in South Asia, where it
averages 44 percent (Figure 3). While labor
market access for women has improved over
the years, this has not gone hand in hand with
the creation of equal work opportunities for
them. The share of women working in wage
employment has declined from 33 percent in
2000 to 21 percent in 2011 (Table 1); female
employees earn around 63 percent of the
average wage of males, and over 63 percent
of employed women work as (unpaid)
contributing family workers. Unemployment
rates are also higher for females (8.9 percent)
than males (4.5 percent). The low female
participation rate and share in wage
employment reflects both cultural and societal
preferences and, despite improvements in
recent years, much lower education and
literacy levels for women than for men. Thus,
increasing female education and literacy levels
should help improve female participation and
employment opportunities.

Pakistan’s labor market is less efficient
than those of other countries in the region,
and continues to be a constraint to Pakistan’s
competitiveness.9 Pakistan has been ranked
136 out of 142 countries in labor market
efficiency in the World Economic Forum’s
Global Competitiveness Report 2011/12,
slipping further behind 23 countries since
2007/08. The Report suggests Pakistan needs
to increase female participation in the labor
force significantly, reduce redundancy cost,
and improve the linkage between pay and
productivity. It also highlights inflexibility in
9

The efficiency of the labor market relates to the
ability of the labor market to allocate workers to their
most efficient use in the economy and provide them
with incentives to give their best effort in their jobs.
The World Economic Forum ranks countries in terms
of labor market efficiency based on indicators such as
cooperation in labor-employer relations, flexibility of
wage determination, rigidity of employment, hiring
and firing practices, redundancy costs, pay and
productivity, reliance on professional management,
brain drain, and female participation in labor force.

wage determination as wages are generally
set outside a centralized bargaining process.
Improvement in labor market efficiency is
critical if jobs are to be created in the formal
private sector. Reform of labor laws and
institutions is needed, with the objective of
striking a balance between ensuring
fundamental rights to workers and increased
efficiency and productivity of the labor
market.
Generating employment for a young and
fast-growing population is a key policy
challenge. Pakistan’s population growth rate
of 2.2 percent (annual average) over the last
decade is almost twice the average rate for
emerging and developing economies and four
times that in advanced economies.
Furthermore, with more than 40 percent of the
population below the age of 14, the number
of new entrants to the labor force is growing
rapidly (Figure 4). During 2000/01–2006/07,
youth unemployment rate decreased from
13.3 percent to 7.5 percent. However, since
then it has increased to over 10 percent in
2010/11, about 2.6 times the unemployment
rate for adults aged over 25 years, indicating
difficulty in absorbing the new labor market
entrants. The youth are at a disadvantage
because they lack experience; the dynamic
process of matching jobs with job seekers
needs to be institutionalized in order to
address youth unemployment. Pakistan has
also been an exporter of labor since early

1970s and so far over 5.7 million Pakistanis are
registered as working abroad. Remittances by
these workers are an important source of
foreign exchange for Pakistan (see
Appendix 5). The government has sought to
create employment and improve skills mainly
through microcredit facilities and vocational
training programs. These measures have been
limited in size by financial and administrative
capacity constraints on their ability to create
employment and improve labor force quality.
Employing a rapidly growing labor force
will require a sustained acceleration in
growth. The labor force is projected to grow
by 3.4 percent per annum (its average growth
rate for the past decade), implying more than
2 million people entering the labor force
annually. Given an estimated employment
elasticity of GDP growth of 0.5,10 average GDP
growth needs to be 7 percent per annum to
absorb new labor market entrants,
a significant increase relative to historical
trends. Furthermore, based on the staff
projections for growth current in the baseline
and reform scenarios during 2011/12–2015/16

respectively), the unemployment rate would
increase to 10 or 13 percent in 2015/16

To meet its large employment challenge
Pakistan needs sustained and inclusive
growth and improved human capital. A
growing labor force, the large number of
unpaid workers, and those employed working
less than 35 hours per week show a need to
create more and better jobs, which will be
facilitated by high, sustained, and more
inclusive economic growth. Alleviating key
constraints to economic growth—unreliable
electricity supply, fiscal and external
vulnerabilities, low productivity, poor public
service delivery, weak private and public
sector governance, and policy uncertainty—
will be critical.11 The presence of a large
economically inactive segment of the
population is indicative of high dependency
on the employed; it calls for policy
interventions in health12 and education to
improve skills, close the gender gap, and
thereby improve the quality and productivity
of Pakistan’s human capital. Further, action in
these areas is needed to meet the
employment needs of Pakistan’s young and
growing population to ensure improved labor
market outcomes.

Appendix 4. Banking Sector Vulnerabilities1
Pakistan’s banking system maintains a
capital ratio in excess of the minimum
requirement and is relatively liquid and
profitable. However, it is vulnerable to risks
from significant holdings of government
securities and rising NPLs on lending to the
private sector. Although holdings of
government securities improve banks’ capital
and liquidity ratios, they remain subject to
changes in market valuation and are
crowding out private-sector credit. Rapid
deposit growth will be needed to support
additional holdings of government securities.
There is evidence of weak underwriting at
some public banks. Problem institutions are a
relatively small portion of the banking system
and are being restructured, albeit slowly. The
authorities are encouraged to strengthen
banks’ ability to assess credit risk by
improving the scope and quality of
information available on borrowers. The legal
system needs to accommodate faster
recovery on defaulted loans. To strengthen
confidence in the banking system,
particularly in the event of an adverse shock,
the authorities should seek to pass explicit
deposit insurance legislation.
Pakistan’s financial sector is relatively
small in1relation to its economy. Financial
sector assets are only about 40 percent of
GDP, whereas in many Asian emerging
markets they average around 80 percent. It
is comprised largely of banks, which make
up nearly 90 percent of the sector (Table 1).
Nonbanks are dominated by insurance
companies. Within the banking system,
there are four main types of institutions:
private (76 percent), public (17 percent),
1

foreign (3 percent) and specialized
(2 percent). Altogether the banking system
has 38 banks, of which there are 23 private
and five public banks. The latter include one
relatively large national bank and three
provincial institutions. Foreign banks are
mainly branches. Specialized banks, which
are also public institutions, exist to support
long-term lending in the agriculture and
manufacturing sectors of the economy.

Pakistan’s banking authorities have made
some progress toward safeguarding
overall financial stability. At nearly
15 percent of risk-weighted assets, the
overall banking system maintains capital in
excess of the minimum requirement of
10 percent. Banking system liquidity is
supported by cash and statutory liquidity
requirements for local and foreign currency
accounts; and by relatively large holdings of
government securities (32 percent of assets),
for which there is an active secondary
market. On the whole, banks are also
profitable, offering an after-tax return on
equity of 14.1 percent as of September
2011, supported in part by relative wide net
interest margins. Separately, the authorities
have put in place a number of

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT AND POST-PROGRAM MONITORING

macroprudential measures, including
dynamic provisioning and limits on the size
of credit and foreign currency exposures.
Banking authorities have also taken bold
steps to restructure some individual
problem banks. The SBP and the SECP are
developing draft legislation for consolidated
supervision of bank holding groups, which
are engaged in banking, insurance and
investment activities. From the perspective
of surveillance, the authorities are using
standard data definitions, including
definitions for NPLs, which strengthen
confidence in data comparability across
countries.
However, the banking system remains
vulnerable to the following risks:


rising NPLs on bank loan portfolios;



rising holdings of government
securities; and



delays in restructuring of problem
institutions.

textiles and food producers; for which NPLs
have risen to 17.7 percent of the total
through end-September and remain on an
upward trend. Textile producers are
reportedly experiencing significant
difficulties in operating plant equipment on
account of frequent energy load-shedding.
NPLs also remain elevated on agricultural
and consumer loans, although both these
categories of loans constitute relatively
small proportions of overall bank lending.
While banks usually lend only against
collateral, cash recovery in case of default
appears relatively low, with the cumulative
rate estimated at roughly 30 percent of
NPLs over time. Average system provisions
were at 66 percent of NPLs.
Rising NPLs can be traced to weak
underwriting as well as deterioration in
the macroeconomic environment.
Comparing the actual performance of loan
portfolios with theoretical performance
based on loan portfolio composition
suggests that public and specialized banks
have been less successful than other banks
in assessing borrower creditworthiness
(Figure 2).2 This suggests that the authorities
could usefully review data quality and
coverage in the existing online credit
registry.

The theoretical NPL for a particular type of bank is
computed by weighting its mix of corporate,
agricultural and consumer loans with systemwide
NPLs for each of these loan types. The difference
between the theoretical and actual NPLs for a
particular bank type is a measure of its quality of
underwriting relative to the system average.

Higher levels of NPLs could increase
solvency pressures for some banks. If
recent trends in NPLs were to continue in
the medium term (three years), banks could
face significant additional losses above and
beyond existing provisions (Table 2).3 Even
though the overall system is expected to be
able to absorb such credit deterioration in
the medium term, individual banks could
come under pressure. This assessment is
based on a number of assumptions,
including, expected future earnings and
larger projected levels of NPLs on loan
portfolios of banks with weaker
underwriting practices relative to the overall
system. Specialized banks, which are
presently undercapitalized, could require an
additional Rs 3 billion in capital, even taking
into consideration potential earnings on
existing assets.

In the face of rising NPLs, banks are
increasing holdings of government
securities. As private-sector NPLs rise, banks
have an incentive to increase holdings of
government securities, which carry zero risk
weights, offer relatively high nominal yields,
may be easily traded in the secondary
market, and used to satisfy liquidity
requirements. Private-sector credit has
indeed declined in recent quarters.
Significant bank holdings of government
securities pose a risk for the financial
sector and for the overall economy.
Although these securities help improve bank
capital adequacy and liquidity ratios, they
remain subject to changes in market
valuation (if held in trading accounts), such
as might result from higher inflation. Also,
they pose a risk for the overall economy by
crowding out the ability of banks to extend
credit to the private sector.

3

Extrapolation of the five-year NPL trend would
lead to system-wide NPLs of 21 percent by 2014.
NPLs are already 25.2 percent at public banks and
30.9 percent at specialized banks as of September
2011.

There is an upper limit to the amount of
government securities that banks might
be able to absorb. For now, bank lending to
the government could be supported by the
high deposit growth of 16 percent in recent
years along with a tiny cushion for existing
advances to deposits ratio (60 percent)
relative to the statutory requirement for a
max of 70 percent (Figure 3). Staff estimates
suggest that current holdings of
Rs 2.2 trillion in government securities could
approach Rs 3 trillion before the banking
system would be forced to cut back privatesector credit (Table 3). In principle, this could
happen much sooner. The critical factor
supporting holdings of government
securities is deposit growth, which has been
fairly steady for several years and has
benefited from structural developments,
including progress in online/mobile banking
and expansion of bank branches in rural
areas.

*All amounts in billions of Pakistani rupees.

Lengthy or delayed restructuring of
problem banks is another source of risk
for the system. Such banks remain
especially vulnerable to adverse
macroeconomic shocks in the interim. One
public bank is only expected to meet the
minimum capital requirement in five years’
time; and a decision to restructure the two
largest specialized banks has only been
taken recently after being several years
overdue.
In the past, the SBP was not sufficiently
empowered to address the known issues
of a problem bank. Known problems at the
bank included imprudent and fraudulent
lending, including one loan of Rs 10 billion
advanced without collateral. The SBP says
that it had identified governance and
lending problems before fraud came to light
in 2008, but was unable to take remedial
action because of political resistance. The
SBP notes that, in hindsight, it could have
set tighter limits on credit exposure at the
bank and sought an increase in provisioning
beyond statutory requirements, as these
steps might have helped to reduce public
costs. This is a case for bolstering the
independence of the bank supervisory

authority and expanding its enforcement
powers.

when NPLs are high relative to historical
norms.

Policy Recommendations

Review macroprudential limits. The goal is
not to restrict opportunities for extension of
private-sector credit but to ensure that
banks are capable of handling risks posed.

The authorities should consider a swift
restructuring of problem banks. While
banks undergoing restructuring should be
given enough time to repair balance sheets,
the authorities may wish to consider the
case for speedier resolution, taking into
consideration costs borne by related
counterparties and creditors.
Undertake comprehensive review of the
coverage and quality of borrower credit
data available to banks. This review should
seek to ensure that banks have access to
sufficiently detailed information on
corporations and individuals, which allows
them to make appropriate determination of
aggregate debt and ability to make
payments on such debt based on a
reasonable projection of future income.
Such a review could analyze the data quality
and coverage of the existing online credit
registry (e-CIB) and assess whether it is
effectively used by banks.
Review dynamic provisioning approach.
The SBP has introduced a macroprudential
measure that allows banks to take lower
(general) provisions during periods when
their profits are lower. The SBP has
discretion over the threshold of bank
profitability, which could make the provision
requirement uncertain for banks. At present,
the after-tax return on equity of
14.1 percent is below that in the boom years
of 2005–06, and (general) provisions are
correspondingly lower. The authorities may
wish to reconsider this approach as (general)
provision requirements are lower at a time


The authorities may wish to review
the existing limit on the debt-to-income
ratio for loans to individuals to determine if
banks are able to capture the full scope of
borrower debt payments. At present, the
limit on monthly debt payments to income
is set at 50 percent, which, in other
countries, might include mortgage
payments but would still be considered
high.

The existing limit on single credit
exposure of 30 percent of equity, which
includes loans that are fully secured by
collateral, is somewhat higher than in other
countries. It might be noted that the Basel
Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS)
has recommended that a size limit on
individual credit exposure should not exceed
25 percent of regulatory capital of bank or
banking group.
Initiate dialogue with relevant players
regarding establishment of commercial
courts to speed up recovery process for
loans in default. Present recovery rates
appear much lower than in other countries
because of difficulties in the legal process.
It may well be useful to undertake a
comprehensive review of creditor rights,
debt recovery, and the corporate and
personal insolvency regime, which would
include the effectiveness of courts and the
legal process.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT AND POST-PROGRAM MONITORING

To strengthen confidence in the banking
system, it is important to pass legislation
for explicit deposit insurance. A draft law
for deposit insurance has been in the
pipeline for a few years but the SBP
indicated that passage was unlikely until
after the 2012 elections. The authorities
should seek to implement the existing
proposal, eventually using a risk-based levy
on banks. The size of the deposit insurance
fund could be on the order of 5 percent of
insured deposits, as in many other
countries.4
Consider strengthening the statutory
liquidity requirement for foreign
currency accounts. Banking system liquidity
is supported by a cash reserve requirement
(CRR) of 5 percent and statutory liquidity
requirement (SLR) of 19 percent for rupee
accounts and 15 percent for foreign
currency accounts. The SLR requirement for
foreign currency accounts is lower than for
rupee accounts because the reserve is held
with the SBP rather than at the banks
themselves.

Continue to promote deposit growth to
create space for government securities
and private-sector credit. The tax of
0.2 percent on daily deposit withdrawals
exceeding Rs 25,000 is not conducive to

hurting system liquidity. The authorities may
wish to consider elimination of this tax.

workers’ remittances.6 In Pakistan, data on
worker’s remittances reflect transactions on
account of “family maintenance” and routed
through official channels only. A recent study
by the International Organization for
Migration (IOM) based on a survey, 548
Pakistani households with at least one family
member working in Saudi Arabia, reported
that only approximately 40 percent of
remittances go through official channels,
while the rest are transferred through
unofficial channels, friends and relatives, and
migrants themselves.7 This would suggest that
official data significantly underestimate
remittances in Pakistan. However, official data
on workers’ remittances could also include
one-time capital transfers from migrants
returning permanently to Pakistan, or any

remittances are the third most important source of
capital for economic growth in Pakistan. See The

other transfers reported by the remitter to be

an adverse shock).8 These would tend to
overestimate remittances in Pakistan. Keeping
in mind the possible data weaknesses, the rest
of this appendix analyzes recent trends.

and hence higher incomes, of migrating
workers.9 In particular, the outflow of workers
has increased significantly since 2006, and
recent monthly data points to continued
strength in outflows.10 Looking forward, large
oil revenues and long-term infrastructure
needs in GCC countries, a major destination
for Pakistani migrants, are expected to
continue to attract migrant workers. While
this bodes well for remittances, it is a possible
indication of significant weaknesses in the
domestic labor market. Finally, the recent
strength in remittances could also reflect the
impact of the Pakistan Remittance Initiative
(PRI), through which the Government of
Pakistan introduced measures to facilitate and
support the flow of remittances.11 As a
consequence, some of the least costly
worldwide corridors for remittances include
Saudi Arabia–Pakistan and United Arab
Emirates–Pakistan. A recent study by Yang
(2011) supports the view that the response of
remittances to fee reduction can be quite
large.12

There are some indications that the recent
performance of remittances in Pakistan could
be sustained in the future. First, remittances
have historically been quite strong, especially
in the 1970s and early 1980s (Figure 2).
Second, the decline in remittances as a share
of GDP in the 1990s may have reflected a shift
by remitters to less costly methods of
transferring money, including the hawala
system, which is not accounted for in official
statistics on remittances. In addition, the
liberalization of Pakistan’s foreign exchange
system in 2000, and greater surveillance of
private transfers after 9/11 may explain the
large increase in official remittances in 2002.
Third, a recent study by Kock and Sun (2011)
suggests that the recent performance of
Pakistan’s remittances reflects: (i) significant
worker migration; and (ii) higher skill levels,
8

It should also be noted that remittances systems are
known to be vulnerable to misuse for money
laundering as well as for terrorist financing purposes.
Pakistan should address the weaknesses identified by
the Financial Action Task Force through an
appropriate sanctions regime, and increase the range
of measures to prevent these activities.

Pakistan Remittance Initiative (PRI) was launched by
the Government of Pakistan with the purpose of
facilitating faster and cheaper flow of workers’
remittances into Pakistan. In particular, PRI includes
(i) reimbursement by the Government of Pakistan
through the SBP of 25 Saudi Riyal equivalent per
transaction to banks in Pakistan so that no charges
for remitting are asked of the remitter or the
beneficiary; and (ii) reimbursement of some
marketing expenses by banks to facilitate home

However, the strength of remittances could
also reflect temporary factors. In particular, it
may partly reflect the typical countercyclical
behavior of remittances observed by Chami et
al. (2009), especially following the earthquake
in 2008 and the devastating floods in 2010.1 In
addition, roughly ¾ of Pakistan’s remittances
come from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates, the United States, and the United
Kingdom, which makes them relatively
dependant on the vagaries of local economic
and financial developments (Figure 3). In
particular, the relative stability of the Pakistan
rupee against the U.S. dollar, coupled with
relatively high domestic interest rates in
Pakistan, may have resulted in higher-thannormal remittances. Kock and Sun (2011) also
note that remittances have been supported
by the relative return on investments in the
host and home countries, including Pakistan’s
agricultural output. Moreover, the IOM’s 2009
study notes in their household survey that
close to 17 percent of remittances are used to
finance real estate and agricultural machinery,

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT AND POST-PROGRAM MONITORIN

(e.g., a sharp decline in the policy rate as has
occurred in October 2011), these remittances
could decline abruptly. As seen recently,
remittances can adjust quite rapidly, declining
from US$1.3 billion in August 2011 to slightly
below US$900 million in September.
Overall, there are some indications that the
high level of remittances to Pakistan reflects
fundamental factors. However, temporary
factors may also have played a role, and may
reverse, suggesting that a cautious approach
should be taken to relying on remittances to
safeguard external stability. Given the possible
downside, the staff’s macroeconomic
framework for Pakistan forecasts only modest
increases in remittances over the medium
term.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT AND POST-PROGRAM MONITORING—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

ANNEX II: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
(As of January 2012)

1.
Pakistan is among the largest
recipients of World Bank financial assistance.
The World Bank Group program in Pakistan
consists of an integrated package of financial
support, including IBRD lending,
concessional IDA credits, Trust Funds and
Grants administered by the Bank on behalf of
other development partners, Multi-Donor
Trust Fund (MDTF) for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
(KP), Federally Administered Tribal Areas
(FATA) and Balochistan, IFC investments, and
MIGA guarantees, along with complementary
analytical and advisory services.
2.
The Country Partnership Strategy
(CPS) outlines the Bank’s strategic approach
to helping Pakistan achieve its development
goals over a four year period. The Bank
Group’s Board of Directors endorsed a
Country Partnership Strategy for Pakistan on
July 8, 2010, covering fiscal years 2010
through 2013. The goal of the strategy is to
help steer Pakistan’s economy back onto a
path of high growth by addressing key longterm constraints to growth: weak revenue
mobilization, unreliable energy supply, and
a fragile security situation.
3.
A CPS Progress Report was presented
to the World Bank’s Board on December 20,
2011. The Progress Report confirms that the
overall strategic goal remains valid and
consistent with the priorities of the
Government of Pakistan as articulated in its
New Framework for Growth Strategy (NFGS).
The partnership remains centered on the
existing strategic pillars of the CPS: economic
governance; human development and social

protection; infrastructure; and security and
conflict risk reduction. It was agreed with the
Government to extend the CPS period to
include FY14.
4.
The four strategic pillars of the CPS
are described below:


Improving Economic Governance.
Addressing the shortcomings of
Pakistan’s economic management is
critical not only for restoring
macroeconomic stability but also for
reducing the likelihood of reversals
leading to another cycle of growth giving
way to stagnation. Enhancing domestic
revenue mobilization is an urgent priority
for the Bank during the CPS period.
Strengthening public expenditure
management at all levels of government
will complement this focus. The strategy
also focuses on governance of markets
with a view to strengthening Pakistan’s
competitiveness by addressing barriers
to competition, and factor market
rigidities (including constraints in access
to finance).



Improving Human Development and
Social Protection. Improvement in human
development, including social protection,
is critical to the goal of building resilience
at the level of families and individuals.
The focus of Bank Group efforts is to
support increased spending on human
development along with reforms to
improve governance and accountability
in the provision of services. In education,
the Bank supports government programs
that combine supply side interventions
and demand-side measures to improve

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

5

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT AND POST-PROGRAM MONITORING—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

access to education with a focus on
equity to address regional and gender
imbalances. In social protection, the Bank
is supporting the Benazir Income Support
Program (BISP), the country’s national
safety net program with a focus on
increasing its targeting efficiency and
strengthening its operation. The Bank
aims to scale up support to strengthen
health management systems and
improve service delivery. Given increased
frequency of natural disasters, the Bank
will bring additional focus and assistance
on the Disaster Risk Management (DRM)
agenda.




6

Improving Infrastructure to Support
Growth. Supply expansion and improving
reliability and efficiency of power and gas
systems are central to Pakistan’s growth
and development. At present, power is
the most pressing need in infrastructure
and the Bank Group supports adoption
of policies that bring about financial
sustainability, expansion of generation in
a least cost manner, and improvement in
the efficiency of transmission and
distribution.
Improving Security and Reducing the
Risk of Conflict. The persistence of
conflict in KP and FATA poses a threat
to some of the most vulnerable and
marginalized populations in Pakistan,
while also challenging economic stability
across the country. The Bank is seeking
to help Pakistan cope with the
consequences of conflict while reducing
the prospects of future conflicts. The
MDTF for KP, FATA and Balochistan is the
Bank’s principal instrument for strategic
engagement in crisis hit regions in

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PAKISTAN

partnership with other development
partners.
5.
IFC is an integral part of the World
Bank Group’s program in Pakistan. The IFC
strategy in Pakistan seeks to continue
expanding investments in the sectors with
the highest potential development impact
and opportunities, including infrastructure
(e.g. renewable energy, ports), financial
markets (e.g. SME support through access to
finance, housing finance), and manufacturing
and services (e.g. agribusiness, technical
education). IFC is also focused on successful
implementation of its advisory programs
designed to improve the business enabling
environment, strengthen financial markets,
and support development of small
businesses.
6.
Pakistan is also a focus country for
MIGA, where it has already provided
guarantees in hydropower and microfinance.
Going forward, MIGA’s strategy seeks to
support investments into IDA countries,
South-South investments, complex
infrastructure projects, and investments into
conflict-affected areas.
7.
Going forward, the Bank’s key
principles of engagement in Pakistan include
(i) delivering fewer but larger operations to
allow the Bank to focus its limited resources
on strategic areas where the needs are the

PAKISTAN

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT AND POST-PROGRAM MONITORING—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

greatest; (ii) increasing the use of
performance-based instrument;
(iii) strengthening attention to
implementation, results and communications;
(iv) deepening the engagement with the
provinces, which will require significant
attention to capacity support; (v) leveraging
partnerships for shared objectives; and
(vi) for MDTF, start small and scale up
success. The Bank does not expect to provide
policy support in the near term given the
weak conditions for macro-economic reform,
but will remain engaged in the critical issues
of revenue mobilization and power through
analytical work, ongoing projects and
exploring results based operations.

ANNEX III: RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN
DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of January 2012)
1.
Pakistan is a major recipient of
financial support from the Asian
Development Bank. Since 1968, the ADB has
provided more than $20 billion in assistance
through the highly concessional Asian
Development Fund (ADF) window and the
Ordinary Capital Resources (OCR) window.
2.
The ADB’s Board of Directors
endorsed the Country Partnership Strategy
(CPS) covering the years 2009-2013 in
January 2009. Consistent with the ADB’s
long-term strategic framework (Vision 2020),
the CPS has the overarching objective of
supporting sustainable and inclusive growth
in Pakistan as a means of reducing the
incidence of poverty and improving welfare.
The CPS outlines the ADB’s strategic
approach to assisting Pakistan in achieving
its development goals over the five year
period by facilitating structural change,
investment and institutional effectiveness.
3.
The main areas of current ADB
operations in Pakistan reflect the CPS 20092013: (i) energy; (ii) infrastructure
investments in transport, logistics and
irrigation; (iii) reforms in key sectors
including energy, finance, agriculture and
industry; and (iv) urban services, including
water, waste management and transport.
4.
Much of ADB lending is under the
multi-tranche financing facility (MFFs). At
present, there are 8 active MFFs: energy
(4, $2.89 billion total); transport (2, $1.67
billion total); irrigation (1; $900 million) and

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

urban services (1, $300 million). Of the total
$5.76 for all eight MFFs, $2 billion has been
committed for subprojects and tranches, with
$3.7 billion available for new projects in these
sectors. For 2011, we have also approved two
more periodic finance requests (PFR) in the
power and irrigation sectors, for a combined
amount of about $500 million.
5.
The current portfolio is comprised
entirely of projects, with a total value of
about $3.0 billion, with energy accounting for
the largest share ($1.1 billion), followed by
emergency assistance (earthquake, floods
$1 billion), agriculture and irrigation
($396 million), transport ($400 million), and
other ($45 million).
6.
In addition to its activities in the
areas outlined above, the ADB has provided
trade finance support to nine Pakistani banks
under its Trade Finance Facilitation Program
(TFFP). To date, the TFFP has supported over
$2.0 billion in trade in Pakistan through the
provision of guarantees, working through
13 participating and 3 issuing banks in
Pakistan.

PAKISTAN

ANNEX IV: STATISTICAL ISSUES
As of December 12, 2011
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but broadly adequate for surveillance.
National Accounts: In 2004, the Federal Bureau of Statistics (FBS) completed a revision of the
national accounts statistics to bring them in line with the concepts and definitions of the 1993
System of National Accounts (1993 SNA). As noted by the December 2004 data ROSC, informal
economic activities need to be better captured, while newly emerging activities, such as in the
information technology sector, continue to pose challenges. The FBS is currently working on
producing quarterly national accounts (QNA), which would be completed with a rebasing of the
national accounts to the year 2005/06. With respect to labor market statistics, the FBS has now
compiled and started releasing quarterly employment/ unemployment data, the first release
being in February 2011 and included 5 years of historical data and is investigating the feasibility
of disseminating data on wages/salaries.
Price statistics: The FBS produces three price indices: the CPI, the wholesale price index (WPI),
and the sensitive price indicator (SPI). The CPI and WPI are compiled on a monthly basis. The SPI
is compiled on a weekly basis and consists of 46 essential commodities that are consumed by the
lowest income group. The concepts and definitions of the CPI and WPI follow international
guidelines. FBS introduced the classification of individual consumption by purpose (COICOP) with
rebasing of the indices to 2007/08 in August 2011. Aside from the implementation of COICOP,
changes to the CPI included updated weights, and expanded item and geographic coverage.
These changes reflect international recommendations and best practices. Plans have been made
to complete the work to develop a Producer Price Index (PPI); IMF is providing technical
assistance in this regard.
Government finance statistics: The concepts and definitions used in compiling government
finance statistics are broadly based on the GFSM 1986, except that privatization proceeds are
included below the line. The scope of central government data is further limited because it does
not cover the activity of extra budgetary funds. Classification and sectorization in source data
follow GFSM 1986 standards to a limited extent. The classification of expenditure deviates from
GFSM 1986 methodology because the economic and functional classifications are mixed in
reporting, in particular, with defense and government administration expenditures not clearly
identified according to economic classification. The basis of recording GFS is on, or close to, a
cash basis. Transactions are recorded on a gross basis. Corrective transactions are not necessarily
made in the original period, as required by GFSM 1986. The authorities have indicated their
intent to adopt the methodology of GFSM 2001 over the medium term, and in line with the
Board decision (No 14656 of October 2010) to strengthen fiscal analysis, they have compiled with
staff assistance fiscal table in GFSM 2001 presentation. However, further improvements in
government finance statistics are needed and the authorities are making progress toward that
objective in the context of the Project for the Improvement of Financial Reporting and Auditing

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PAKISTAN

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT AND POST-PROGRAM MONITORING—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

(PIFRA). Budgetary central government operations data are regularly reported for publication in
the GFS Yearbook, and use the GFSM 2001 framework. However, no data are reported on
transactions in nonfinancial and financial assets and liabilities. The authorities do not report
higher frequency data for inclusion in the IFS.
Monetary statistics: The ROSC mission found that the scope of the monetary statistics is
comprehensive. The classification and sectorization of the monetary survey compiled by the State
Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) Statistics Department for reporting to the IMF and for internal use are
broadly in line with the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM). The basis for recording
flows and stocks is largely consistent with the MFSM, and the SBP has indicated its intention to
adopt the MFSM in order to further improve monetary statistics. The ROSC mission that
conducted the reassessment of monetary statistics in November 2006 found that the authorities
had implemented the MFSM guidelines on the sectorization of institutional units, classification of
financial instruments, and the recording of securities repurchase agreements (repos). Also, a new
reporting framework for other depository corporations has been designed and is being
implemented. Progress has been made in resolving discrepancies in the data on interbank
positions between the SBP and scheduled banks. The SBP has reported the Standardized Report
Forms for central bank (1SR), other depository corporations (2SR), and monetary aggregates
(5SR) to the Fund for publication in the IFS.
Balance of payments: Starting in the third quarter of 2003 (July–September), Pakistan’s balance
of payments statements have been prepared according to the methodology of the Balance of
Payments Manual, fifth edition (BPM5). A 2007 Fund technical assistance mission made
recommendations to more closely align some recording practices with the BPM5, including in the
areas of residency, sectorization, and consistency across related data sets. Based on these
recommendations, a number of improvements have been made. Differences between the two
sources of trade data (customs records for FBS and exchange records for SBP) for exports and
imports have been widening. Most of the differences can be reconciled ex post (see SBP’s
Second Quarterly Report for FY2006), and the authorities are working to narrow these differences
before the publication of the data.

International investment position: Annual international investment position data are compiled
and published on the SBP website. Since 2010 SBP has also started publishing quarterly data on
international investment position. Annual data are available back to 2003.
II. Data Standards and Quality

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation and
Proposal for Post-Program Monitoring with Pakistan

On February 3, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation and Proposal for Post-Program Monitoring with
Pakistan.1
Background
Pakistan has faced difficult challenges in the past few years, including external and
domestic economic shocks, political uncertainty, and security problems. Despite these
challenges, the economic policymakers have taken policy actions and implemented several
reforms, including those under the recently expired Stand-By Arrangement, which helped
the economy avoid a full-blown crisis in 2008/09. These actions and reforms include
establishment of an interest rate corridor, implementation of a more market-based
exchange rate regime, and a strengthening of the enforcement powers of the State Bank
of Pakistan (SBP). In addition, the authorities substantially raised electricity tariffs and
domestic prices of the main petroleum products, and the Benazir Income Support Program
(BISP) provided basic income support to the poor during the various shocks that have hit
Pakistan.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On

More recently, however, unresolved structural problems (especially in the energy sector),
two major floods, difficulties in implementing key policy reforms, and a more challenging
global environment have combined to limit growth and employment creation and made the
economy highly vulnerable, with few buffers to absorb shocks. Indeed, economic
performance has weakened and external pressures are mounting. In 2010/11,2 real GDP
expanded by 2.4 percent—far below the estimated 7 percent required to absorb the two
million new labor market entrants annually—with inflation persistently in double digits.
Unemployment is high when underemployment and unpaid employment are taken into
account, while poverty incidence and measures of human development are at worrisome
levels. Efforts to boost revenue mobilization were once again frustrated by a lack of political
support, and the fiscal deficit widened to 6.6 percent of GDP in 2010/11. Monetary policy
has become more accommodative, with the SBP directly or indirectly (through liquidity
injections via open market operations) financing fiscal deficits. While the economy is
recovering from the floods, the external position, until recently a source of strength on
booming exports and workers’ remittances, is deteriorating. The rupee has come under
some pressure, prompting SBP exchange market intervention. The SBP’s foreign
exchange reserves have declined by about $2 billion in the last six months.
On current policies, Pakistan’s near- and medium-term prospects are challenging. Growth
would remain too low to absorb the large number of new entrants into the labor force,
inflation would remain high, and the external position would weaken further. In 2011/12,
real GDP growth is projected at 3.4 percent and average CPI inflation at 12 percent. A
deterioration in the current account balance due to lower cotton/textile prices and a sharp
slowdown in remittances growth, continued difficulties in attracting external financing, and
the beginning of repayments to the IMF will likely put further pressure on the balance of
payments this year, with reserves projected at $12.1 billion by end 2011/12. In the absence
of corrective measures, the fiscal deficit is likely to reach 7 percent of GDP, much higher
than the government’s revised budget target of 4.7 percent. Moreover, there are
considerable downside risks to this already difficult baseline, particularly in the context of
an increasingly difficult global environment and concerns about policy weakening ahead of
senate elections in 2012 and parliamentary elections in 2013.

The fiscal year runs from July 1 to June 30.

Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that Pakistan continues to fall short of its economic potential, and
called for a reorientation of macroeconomic and structural policies to stem near-term risks
to macroeconomic stability, and to lay the foundation for durable and inclusive growth over
the medium term.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to reduce the fiscal deficit in order to preserve
macroeconomic stability and reconstitute policy buffers. They encouraged the authorities to
take more resolute action to mobilize revenues and rationalize public expenditure. In
particular, Directors saw merit in further broadening the tax base, restructuring public
enterprises, eliminating poorly targeted subsidies, and phasing out commodity procurement
operations. They also recommended strengthening the framework for fiscal devolution and
the incentives for provincial governments to raise revenue.
Directors stressed that monetary and exchange rate policies need to better focus on
containing inflation and external risks. Monetary policy is now too accommodative, and
should be tightened if inflation or external pressures increase. Central bank financing of the
budget needs to be curtailed, and greater operational independence of the central bank
needs to be secured. Directors also called for more exchange rate flexibility to facilitate
external adjustment and safeguard foreign reserves.
Directors noted the adequate capitalization of banks, but considered that rising
non-performing loan ratios and other weaknesses in banks’ balance sheets present risks to
financial stability. Accordingly, they called for stronger supervisory oversight, improved
mechanisms for resolving problem banks, and the prompt establishment of a bank-financed
deposit insurance scheme. Directors also urged the authorities to address long-standing
deficiencies in the regulatory regimes against money laundering and terrorism financing.

4
Directors welcomed the recent adoption of the New Growth Strategy to guide structural and
institutional reforms on a variety of fronts. They endorsed the authorities’ objective of
further developing private sector’s participation in the economy. They attached high priority
to improving the business environment, boosting external competitiveness, and upgrading
the power sector to remove its burden on the public finances and provide a reliable
electricity supply to support growth. Directors welcomed the authorities’ decision to
subscribe to the Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard.

Statement by Jafar Mojarrad, Executive Director for Pakistan and
Muhammad Sethi, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
February 3, 2012
Our Pakistani authorities would like to thank staff for their engagement, hard work and
advice. Discussions during the Article IV mission were helpful and constructive. The
authorities broadly concur with the general thrust of the report, including staff assessment of
current challenges and the policy recommendations, even though they have somewhat more
nuanced views than staff on the extent of vulnerabilities.
Pakistan has braved economic, security and political challenges since the present elected
government took office in early 2008. At a time when Pakistan, a non-oil producer and net
food importer, was severely hit by the global recession and the food and oil price shocks, the
authorities, with Fund support under the SBA, embarked on a bold stabilization and reform
program that has helped mitigate the impact of the shocks and achieve significant gains in
macroeconomic and financial stability, as well as in economic growth and the fight against
poverty. Unfortunately, the devastations caused by two major floods together with
resurgence of oil price shock, and continued difficult security situation, deprived the
authorities of the needed support and consensus to persevere with the program. However,
while the arrangement ended in September 2011, the authorities have remained steadfast in
implementing structural reforms while attempting to stabilize the macroeconomic situation.
They are also committed to follow the alternative reform scenario over the medium term.
The authorities are cognizant of the need to address political uncertainties and structural
impediments to growth, including restoring fiscal sustainability and strengthening and
deepening the financial sector, which would guide them towards a sustainable and higher
growth trajectory. Enhancing revenues, improving expenditure management and
prioritization, restructuring public sector enterprises and resolving problems in the energy
sector are key areas of reforms to spur growth, as is improving the business environment for
private sector development, including by upgrading infrastructure. Through these policies,
the authorities remain committed to improving the lives of the Pakistani people, in particular

2
the most vulnerable segments of the society. The new growth strategy (NGS) recently
adopted by the government aims at increasing growth performance in the medium term, well
above levels achieved in recent years, so as to absorb the rapidly rising youth labor force. As
indicated in Box 1, the NGS identifies the main impediments to growth and advocates close
cooperation between the government and the private sector in addressing them.
Economic developments and policies
The economy suffered a significant supply shock in the aftermath of devastating floods
in 2010 and 2011, resurgence of the oil shock in November 2010 onward and massive
disruptions in energy supply. Deteriorating global conditions and outlook and negative
spillovers from the European debt crisis also impacted debt and fiscal sustainability. In
addition, security challenges in the region have exacted an extremely high cost on the
economy, both as direct costs of the fight against extremism as well as a knock on effect on
investment inflows and market confidence. Pakistan has borne a significant collateral impact
in terms of the squeezing of fiscal space for critical development and social sector
expenditures. As such, deceleration in growth reflects both internal and external headwinds.
Despite these challenges, based on the data available for the first six months of the current
fiscal year, there are signs of economic recovery led by agriculture and manufacturing. Thus,
economic growth is expected to move closer to the budgeted 4.2 percent. As a result of
improvement in supply conditions and restrained monetary growth, inflation is on a declining
trend, as reflected in Figure 2 of the staff report, reaching 9.7 percent in December 2011 from
15.5 percent in December 2010.
While fiscal consolidation remains a fundamental challenge, efforts are under way for
enhancing revenue mobilization through tax administration efficiency gains and for
strengthening expenditure management. The authorities are cognizant of the fact that
broadening the tax base through additional revenue measures would help ensure long-term
fiscal sustainability. To this end, major reforms have been undertaken by the Federal Board
of Revenue (FBR) by bringing in untaxed sectors into the net. Major sales tax exemptions
and zero-ratings have been withdrawn and exemptions have been restricted to food, health,

3
education, and agriculture. Improved compliance through better monitoring and risk-based
audit has helped detect non-payments and irregular input adjustments of sales tax. A fully
automated refund processing system has also been rolled out for taxpayers.
As a result of these measures, revenue collection by FBR during the first half of FY12
indicates an increase of 27.1 percent over the corresponding period in FY11, and the
authorities consider that a significant part of this improvement is structural and not a onetime phenomenon. Similarly, total expenditure during July–December 2011 amounted to
45 percent of the budget instead of the allocated 50 percent. This is reflective of the tight
fiscal discipline being maintained by the authorities who are confident that maintaining
current trends would help them achieve fiscal targets for the year, even though they
recognize that the task will not be easy. They are also committed to bringing the deficit down
to 3 percent of GDP over the medium term.
Monetary policy conduct has helped inflation to decline during most of 2010, with core
inflation falling sharply towards the end of 2011. Our authorities are preemptively assessing
monetary conditions and would only loosen policy stance once inflation is on a firm
declining trend. Going forward, efforts would continue to be made towards better
coordination between the Ministry of Finance and the SBP to maintain an effective monetary
policy. Further, the staff report in Figure 2 shows that 30–day moving average of daily net
purchases and sales of foreign exchange by the SBP has hovered close to zero since
July 2009 suggesting that the authorities are committed to maintaining exchange rate
flexibility while safeguarding reserves.
During FY11, the external sector benefited from high international commodity prices and
buoyancy in workers’ remittances. As a result, for the first time in six years, the current
account was in surplus. While exports expanded both in terms of volume and price, growth in
workers’ remittances was boosted by increasing use of banking instead of informal transfer
channels. Authorities expect receiving significant foreign inflows from the auction of 3G
mobile licenses in March 2012 and part of the Coalition Support Fund (CSF) due. They
recognize that risks to the external sector emanating from the Euro area are real but would
have moderate fallout on Pakistan except through yet another oil shock.

4

Structural reforms
The authorities continue the process of structural reforms, focusing on power sector and three
key Public Sector Enterprises (PSEs). As mentioned in the Staff report, having vigorously
pursued and institutionalized tariff rationalization, electricity tariffs have been raised by
ninety percent since 2008. The focus now under the Power Sector Recovery Plan 2011 is
towards improving governance and financial restructuring, including by facilitating recovery
of Federal and Provincial government arrears and enforcing collection from the private sector
and PSEs. Together with an ambitious investment program, this will help improve supply
conditions and reduce the budgetary burden. Governance reforms and restructuring plans
have also been adopted and are being implemented for the steel mill, railways, and airlines
companies, which should strengthen their financial position and pave the way for
consideration of future options. In the external sector, recent steps to promote trade and
economic ties between Pakistan and India are important steps towards strengthening regional
cooperation and fostering export growth as highlighted in the report.
Fiscal reforms addressing both revenue and expenditure are key to achieving the authorities’
fiscal consolidation targets. Tax reform will focus on simplification of the system and
improved administration, along with continued reduction in exemptions. Renewed efforts
will also be made toward reaching a consensus on a reformed GST. On the expenditure side,
key reforms include the medium-term budgetary framework (MTBF) and the project to
improve financial reporting and auditing (PIFRA). A Budget Strategy Paper has been
introduced to monitor government performance under output based budgeting. After
approval of the Cabinet, the authorities have placed the MTBF before the parliament, as
required under the Fiscal Responsibility and Debt Limitation Act 2005.
With regard to fiscal decentralization, the authorities agree that there are many challenges
and issues requiring attention. These relate to assignment of responsibilities, building
capacity, and raising own-source revenues, which are critical for sustaining macroeconomic
stability and managing risks and costs of fiscal decentralization during its infancy. The

5
authorities have already requested technical assistance from the Fund, which hopefully would
help manage transition and contribute to addressing these challenges.
The authorities are resolved to further strengthen the financial sector, including through
enhanced supervision, financial deepening, and increased competition. While capital
adequacy levels are strong as highlighted in the staff report, the authorities agree with staff
that further steps are needed to strengthen bank supervision and reduce NPLs. However,
while gross NPLs are generally expected to rise in the context of a low growth and declining
private lending environment, strong supervision and provisioning requirements should help
mitigate risks. As regards the relatively low private sector credit, despite weak external
demand for textiles, the increase in private sector credit during FY12 is encouraging.
Ensuring that the financial system is in compliance with international standards is crucial.
With the enactment of the Anti-Money Laundering Bill in March 2010, the authorities are
addressing the deficiencies in the AML/CFT regime, and are bringing it in compliance with
FATF standards. A Financial Monitoring Unit has been established and made fully
operational. Further, the money exchange companies have been brought under the regulatory
fold of the SBP, with on-sight inspections by the law enforcement agencies. Notwithstanding
the wide-ranging scope of terrorist financing legislation, the authorities have agreed with
FATF to further strengthen existing provisions on criminalization of terrorist financing as
well as confiscation of assets. The authorities remain committed to fight terrorism in any
form.
Debt sustainability
The authorities are committed to continue to improve debt indicators so as to preserve debt
sustainability. The public and external debt-to-GDP ratios are expected to decline in the
baseline scenario over the medium term and, even under the combined shock scenario, these
ratios are projected only marginally higher than the baseline (Figures 4 and 5). Moreover, the
level of external debt projected at around 25 percent for end 2015 is well below emerging
markets average. Further, the debt vulnerability appears subdued, with gross financing needs
indicating a declining trend, as none of the shocks show a rising debt to GDP ratio (Figure 5).

6
Besides, even though gross international reserves (GIR) in percent of short-term (ST) debt at
remaining maturity is projected to fall in FY12–13, it remains above 100 percent and is
projected to increase significantly in outer years (Table 8). However, the authorities intend to
follow prudent borrowing and improve assets/liabilities management to mitigate potential
risks in this area.
Conclusion
Our authorities remain committed to sound macroeconomic management and to
implementing structural reforms despite the expiration of the arrangement with the Fund.
This would preserve macroeconomic stability and help harness the growth potential of the
economy as aptly pointed out by staff in their appraisal. This is all the more crucial in the run
up to the senate and parliamentary elections. They also look forward to continued close
cooperation and engagement with the Fund, including in the context of post-program
monitoring.
