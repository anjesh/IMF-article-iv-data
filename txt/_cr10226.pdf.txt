Staff Report for the 2010 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2010 Consultation with Singapore
Approved by Mahmood Pradhan and Dominique Desruelle
July 1, 2010


Context: Singapore’s recession has been less deep and drawn out than feared at the time
of the 2009 Article IV consultation, a year ago. A broad-based recovery is underway and
the economy has regained all the output lost in the downturn. Policies have shifted out of
crisis mode and smooth exits from extraordinary support have been achieved.



Discussions: May 11−17, 2010, with Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong, Minister for
Finance Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Acting Managing Director of the Monetary
Authority of Singapore (MAS) Ong Chong Tee, other senior officials, and
representatives of the private sector.



Team: Messrs. Zanello (head), Dodzin, Abdel˗Rahman, Nabar (all APD), and
Balakrishnan (Resident Representative). Mr. Chua (OED) also participated in the
meetings.



Mission focus: The nature of the recovery. Policies to support the expansion and
strengthen medium-term prospects. The medium-term evolution of the current account.
The likely impact of Basel III.



Policy dialog: For a description of policy issues discussed in the 2009 Article IV
consultation, see http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.cfm?sk=23226.0.



Exchange rate system: Singapore has accepted the obligations of Article VIII,
Sections 2, 3, and 4. The exchange system is free of restrictions on the making of
payments and transfers for current international transactions. Solely because of
classification changes, the de facto exchange rate arrangement, previously a floating
regime, is now classified as ―other managed.‖



ROSCs: A fiscal ROSC remains a priority for the authorities. Its exact timing is likely to
be decided next year. A data ROSC could be considered at that time.



Data: Adequate for surveillance.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background. Thanks to strong policies, resilient markets, and an improved external
environment, the 2008−09 recession turned out less deep than feared. A broad-based
expansion is now on. Output losses have been recouped and medium-term issues are again at
the top of the policy agenda.
Policy issues. Macroeconomic management started to transition out of crisis-relief mode late
last year. Policy normalization has by now been achieved. Discussions centered on the
requirements to sustain non-inflationary growth and mitigate external and internal risks, as
well as on topics that have gained prominence in the international post-crisis debate.
Monetary policy. The monetary settings are broadly appropriate. Staff and authorities agreed
that monetary policy should stay the course, absent a significant deterioration of the outlook
for growth and inflation. Exuberance in some segments of the property markets does not
seem to portend a boom-bust cycle in real estate. Macroprudential tools have nonetheless
been deployed preemptively to curb speculative excesses.
Fiscal policy. Like the stimulus of last year, the withdrawal of fiscal support in the 2010
budget has been timely and well calibrated. The fiscal stance is now close to neutral and in
tune with internal balance. The 2010 budget appropriately focuses on supply-side measures to
promote productivity growth.
Financial sector. The domestic financial sector emerged largely unscathed from the global
financial crisis, thanks to sound supervision and risk management systems. There was
agreement that Singapore’s financial sector is strong. Plans (in coordination with Malaysia
and Hong Kong SAR) to unwind by year-end the blanket deposit guarantee and move to a
system with higher deposit coverage are underway. In the view of the authorities, the impact
of Basel III requirements is not expected to be too onerous for Singaporean banks, which are
already well capitalized, have stable funding sources, and whose risky assets are well
provisioned.
Exchange rate. The Singapore dollar in real effective terms is somewhat weaker than its
medium-term equilibrium. Singapore’s exchange rate regime continues to serve the economy
well and the MAS’ exchange-rate centered monetary framework has been an important
source of stability in times of economic turbulence.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Context. A year ago, Singapore seemed in the midst of its worst recession ever.
Collapsing global demand and market sentiment were taking a toll on core domestic
activities.1 Policy responses, although exceptionally large and diversified, were not expected
to fully offset the impact of the external shocks. All considered, the staff and the authorities
were projecting a GDP contraction of about 8 percent for the year at the time of the 2009
Article IV consultation. Defying predictions, the 2008−09 recession turned out to be less
deep than feared. A broad-based expansion is now on. Output losses have been recouped and
medium-term issues are again at the top of the policy agenda.
2.
Focus of the mission. The 2010 Article IV discussions centered on the policies to
sustain non-inflationary growth and mitigate risks, including those related to capital flows
and exuberant property markets. Topics that have gained prominence in the international
policy debate after the crisis—Basel III, self˗insurance through reserve accumulation, the
design of social protection, and productivity-boosting reforms—were also covered in a
Singaporean context. The starting point was a comparative anatomy of the conjuncture from
both a historical and a regional perspective.
II. MACROECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
A. The Recovery of 2009 in the Real Economy
3.
Context. GDP contracted by about 1¼ percent in 2009, an outcome much milder than
anticipated. The recession was the third since the Asia crisis and marked the end of a decade
when output volatility increased and the average annual growth rate dropped to about
5 percent from about 7½ percent in the 1990s.

global market conditions supported financial services. Growth has been double-digit for three
of the last four quarters, reaching nearly 39 percent (q/q s.a.a.r.) in the first quarter of this
year. From a historical perspective, this upswing has been more vigorous than those
following the 2001 dotcom crash and the 1997−98 Asia crisis: GDP was some 16 percent
higher four quarters after the trough, compared to 5−10 percent in the previous downturns.

(e.g., greater downward flexibility in wages).2 With higher levies on foreign workers in the

hours worked and compensation, wage pressures are picking up.

The FY 2009 (ending in March) budget introduced the Resilience Package, aimed at blunting the effects of the
downturn and strengthening longer-term prospects for Singapore. The package amounted to S$20.5 billion
(about 8 percent of GDP). An innovative element was the Jobs Credit Scheme. It provided an incentive for
companies to maintain or increase their Singaporean workforce, by giving them grants of 12 percent of

Balance of payments. Singapore has felt the impact of the global recession primarily
through the trade channel. From peak to trough, non-oil domestic exports fell by close to
30 percent. Their revival has initially been as sluggish as that from the IT recession but it has
gained momentum since late last year. Electronics exports in particular have been boosted by

8.
Cross-country perspective. Singapore’s output trajectory has been broadly similar to
those of regional peers, which all experienced a V-shaped cycle (Figure). The depth of the
contraction was however somewhat greater than average, reflecting the economy’s
extraordinary openness (trade is about three times GDP) and specialization in
cyclically-sensitive goods and services. Where Singapore stands apart from the rest is perhaps
in the evolution of employment and wages, suggesting the critical role played by active
labor-market policies, flexible wage-setting mechanisms, and government guarantees in
supporting households’ confidence and income, firms’ access to credit, and—ultimately—
domestic demand.

Box 1. Singapore: Recent Trends in Capital Flows
Historically, Singapore has experienced
significant net capital outflow, the
counterpart of persistent current account
surpluses. Official flows have constituted the
bulk of net outflows, reflecting mostly
foreign asset accumulation by Singapore’s
sovereign wealth funds. Private flows
excluding FDI have also been negative. Net
FDI flows, on the other hand, have been
consistently positive, the result of
Singapore’s favorable business climate for
multinational corporations.

B. The Recovery of 2009 in the Financial Sector
9.
Context. Although tested, Singapore’s financial system withstood the world recession
well. As global market volatility subsided, financial activities staged a rapid recovery
beginning in early 2009. Banking and insurance led the way, while brokerage and wealth
management were slower in posting gains. More recently, momentum in some financial
services has softened amidst investors’ concerns about global prospects.
10.
Money markets. Singapore’s money markets experienced liquidity pressures at the
onset of the crisis but never seized up.

The SIBOR is a reference rate based on interest rates offered by banks for unsecured lending of Singapore
dollars in the wholesale money market. The SOR represents the effective cost of borrowing Singapore dollars
synthetically by borrowing U.S. dollars for three months and swapping them for Singapore dollars. It is more
volatile than SIBOR because the exchange rate and U.S. money market rates fluctuate more. A steeper slope of
the MAS’ policy band is reflected in the U.S. dollar-Singapore dollar forwards and in lower SOR fixings,
consistent with covered interest parity.

expanding briskly but credit to businesses is still below peak. Regarding the latter, limited
credit access does not seem to be a factor, as suggested by the tapering off of loan approvals
under the government credit guarantee scheme. The deployment of retained earnings to
reduce leverage is also holding back foreign currency nonbank lending in the Asian Dollar
Market. Offshore interbank activity, which is more tied to developments in advanced
economies, is now registering upticks. However, volatile market sentiment is still in the way
of a steady rise in volumes.

Property markets. The recovery of 2009 has been at its most dramatic in Singapore’s
private property market (Box 2). After a prolonged stagnation, private house prices (as
opposed to the prices of the publicly built

mirrored the downward correction. This

a boom-bust cycle. An array of

early 2009, as a result of home-grown
policies and improving conditions in global capital markets. Both economies had similar
trajectories for equity and house prices in the upswing, with exuberance in some segments of
the property market. (Tellingly, the macroprudential responses to prevent a bubble have been
alike). A key difference, of course, is that Hong Kong SAR is inherently more exposed on its
recovery path to inward spillovers from abundant U.S. dollar liquidity or the rapid expansion
in Mainland China, because of the exchange rate peg. By contrast, the risk for a credit-asset
price cycle is lower in Singapore, where the MAS’ policy framework provides a measure of
monetary independence.

Box 2. Singapore: Private Property Prices
After remaining stable for most of the 2000s, property prices have been volatile over the
past year. After losing nearly a quarter of its value from the peak in the second quarter of 2008
through to the trough a year later, the private residential property index has regained almost all
of the lost ground.
Private properties experienced a more pronounced cycle than publicly built units. The
difference is in part due to the large influx of skilled foreign workers bidding up prices
during 2006−08. During this period, Singapore’s labor force expanded by about 8 percent
annually with the number of foreign workers surging by nearly 20 percent each year. (Foreign
workers now account for over one-third of the
labor force). The large peak-to-trough decline
in 2008 was driven by the expectation that the
global slump would curb the inflow of foreign
employees, particularly in financial services.
The recovery in property prices has been
faster than in the previous cycles. By this
stage in the post-Asian crisis recovery,
property prices were 17 percent above their
trough (24 percent in the current cycle).
Looking at the overall property market across peers, prices have risen at broadly the same pace
in Hong Kong SAR, although the cycle took longer to turn in Singapore.
The authorities have taken several pre-emptive measures since September 2009 to
forestall excesses. Some of the initiatives are

17.
External drivers. The global environment improved faster than anticipated. Stronger
external demand and more settled financial markets propelled Singapore’s export-oriented
activities with knock-on effects on private domestic demand. The process had an important
regional dimension, with a key role played by the cross-border production networks centered
on China as well as by the region’s own end-demand. For example, China has become a
high-growth market for Singapore’s tourism services and the insurance industry.
18.
Internal factors. On the domestic front, the authorities’ response to the worsening
conjuncture was forceful and comprehensive—a large fiscal stimulus, decisive monetary
easing, and an array of measures to ensure financial stability and market functionality. In
particular, employment subsidies and training programs were highly successful in supporting
household confidence and businesses’ bottom line. So were schemes to facilitate SME’s
access to credit. More generally, strong economic fundamentals and labor market flexibility
(due in part to the widespread use of bonuses in wage setting) provided important buffers
against the external shocks. Similar actions around the world amplified the effectiveness of
domestic policies by lifting the limits of countercyclical intervention in a small and highly
open economy.
III. POLICY DEVELOPMENTS
19.
Context. With countercyclical support delivered and the recovery on firmer ground,
macroeconomic management started to transition out of crisis-relief mode late last year.
Policy normalization has by now been achieved, and the medium-term compass at the core of
Singapore’s policy frameworks is again center stage in economic decisions.
20.
Monetary policy. In mid-April, the MAS—which targets a nominal effective
exchange rate (NEER) band to safeguard

stronger currency and implied a slight

21.
Fiscal policy. The 2009 budget, which envisaged an unprecedented countercyclical
support, overperformed. The outturn benefitted from higher-than-anticipated tax revenues
(from incomes and property) as well as some undershooting of expenditure. The deficit as
defined by the authorities turned out at about 1 percent of GDP, some 2½ percent of GDP

13
lower than planned.4 The 2010 budget (announced in February) envisages an unchanged
deficit but some unwinding of fiscal countercyclical support. For example, the 2009 job
subsidy scheme came to an end in June, and credit support to SMEs will be phased out
by 2011. Key initiatives in the 2010 budget underscore a return to a medium-term orientation
for fiscal policy. In particular, the budget implements recommendations from the high-level
Economic Strategies Committee (ESC) to foster productivity growth and reduce dependence
on foreign labor through higher levies.5
22.
Financial policies. The MAS ended some of the extraordinary support measures
introduced during the crisis, including the currency swap agreement with the Fed. Other steps
to exit from crisis-related measures are underway. In particular, the MAS has formed a
working group with Bank Negara Malaysia and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority on
exiting from blanket deposit guarantees by the end of 2010—and raising the coverage of
deposit insurance. Enhancements to the MAS liquidity facilities introduced during the crisis
were intended all along to import best practices and have not been rolled back.
IV. OUTLOOK AND RISKS
23.
Near-term outlook. The economy is projected to expand nearly 10 percent in 2010.
Both external and domestic demand should continue to support growth, although the
exceptional momentum of the first quarter is bound to wane. Private consumption will
benefit from further income gains while private investment will reflect post-crisis retooling
and inventory accumulation. As temporary factors and policy support fade, 2011 GDP growth
will be lower but still above potential. On this path, the output gap turns positive and
inflation will be trending up, in part because of one-off factors. CPI inflation is projected at
around 2½ percent this year. The authorities agree with the broad contour of these forecasts,
noting that capacity expansion in a number of industries, including the opening of two large
integrated resorts, should boost growth. The latest official projections are for GDP growth in
the range of 7−9 percent and CPI inflation in the range of 2½−3½ percent in 2010.
24.
Risks. Concerns over fiscal sustainability in some euro area economies may undercut
the global recovery or trigger market turbulence. Growth in Singapore would suffer if trade
shrinks or credit dries up. Adverse spillovers through regional linkages could also arise from
a large correction in China’s property market—a tail risk. There may be upside surprises if
4

The authorities’ definition subtracts from the difference between revenue and operating expenditure top-up
transfers to special funds (about 1¼ percent of GDP in 2010) and adds net investment income from fiscal
reserves (about 3 percent of GDP).

The ESC was established in March 2009 to develop growth strategies for Singapore in a changed world. It was
chaired by the Minister of Finance and included representative from government, industry, and academia. Its
recommendations are in <www.esc.gov.sg>.

14
the external environment improves more than anticipated, boosting export-oriented industries
and financial activities. In this scenario, inflation risks will escalate.
25.
Medium-term outlook. Medium-term economic prospects for Singapore hinge on the
stamina of the global recovery and on structural shifts in advanced economies, as well as the
impact of new productivity-enhancing reforms and lower reliance on foreign labor. In the
baseline, GDP growth converges to a potential rate of about 4 percent, somewhat lower than
average growth over the last decade.
26.
Current account. The current account surplus as a share of GDP will remain sizeable
over a five-year horizon—but not grossly out of line with the ratio probably consistent with
Singapore’s demographic structure,
status as a financial center, and net
foreign asset position, among other
things. From a saving-investment
perspective, private savings will feel
the first impact of population aging
and lower corporate profits as the
economy adjusts.6 Private investment
is projected to increase relative to
GDP with planned expansions in the
biomedical and chemical sectors.
More broadly, higher capital intensity
is a likely outcome of recently launched reforms and incentives. Public investment will also
remain strong, with a pipeline of projects in transport, health, and education. The authorities
shared the staff views on the medium-term evolution of the current account. They also
flagged the potential for reductions in public savings in the longer run, following last year’s
constitutional amendment that enables the government to use more of the returns on its
reserves to fund the budget.
V. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Macroeconomic Policies on the Recovery Path
27.
Context. Monetary, fiscal, and macroprudential policies are appropriately aimed at
sustaining the expansion and curbing risks in the goods and asset markets. However, the road
ahead could be bumpy and flexibility in policymaking remains a priority.

6

The old-age dependency ratio, currently at about 12 percent, is projected to increase to about 16 percent by
2015.

15
28.
Monetary policy. The MAS’ latest two-step recalibration of the policy settings has
restored a neutral stance. In light of projected output and price dynamics, this is appropriate.
There was agreement that, barring a significant change of the outlook for growth or inflation,
monetary policy should stay the course. The staff and the MAS shared the view that, if
modest headwinds are encountered, the width of the NEER band provides a ready-made
shock-absorber. However, if tail risks materialize—for example, if contagion from Europe
spins out of control or capital flows undermine price stability—the policy adjustment will
need to be bolder.
29.
Capital inflows. Regarding risks posed by volatile capital movements, the MAS noted
that gross inflows remain well below the 2006−07 peak and that traditionally Singapore has
been a net exporter of capital. In fact, surges in capital inflows, such as that in the first quarter
of 2010, are generally intermediated out of the country. In the authorities’ view, there is little
evidence that capital inflows are a significant source of asset price bubbles in Singapore.
There was agreement that coping with extraordinary capital inflows could pose challenges
under the MAS’ policy framework, including the possibility that a faster appreciation of the
exchange rate may attract further speculative activity. When necessary, the MAS has
intervened in the foreign exchange market to dampen upward pressure on the Singapore
dollar (and thus deliver price stability), sterilizing the liquidity injections to limit the
volatility of domestic interest rates.
30.
Bubble risks. The return to an appreciation path for the NEER has brought along a
lower cost of credit for businesses and households, with a possible impact on asset prices.7
The authorities shared the view that there may be hot spots in the private housing market
where prices have moved significantly faster than developments in the broader economy
since it turned around in 2009. However, fundamentals too are at play and may explain much
of the action. There was agreement that systemic risks are mitigated by several
considerations: (i) the majority of mortgages have loan-to-value ratios below the regulatory
ceiling; (ii) bank exposure to the property sector (excluding mortgages on owner-occupied
houses) remains well within prudential norms; (iii) mortgage providers have been tightening
for some time the terms of their loans; (iv) low unemployment suggests few household
delinquencies in the pipeline; and, most importantly, (v) the bulk of the housing market
(which is for publicly built apartments) shows little signs of froth.8 Tellingly, Singapore’s

7

With the NEER as the intermediate target of monetary policy and unfettered capital mobility, a monetary
tightening (a faster trend appreciation of the NEER) implies a decline in nominal interest rates consistent with
uncovered interest parity. The impact of the stronger currency more than offsets the stimulus from lower interest
rates, leading to tighter monetary conditions. See IMF, Country Report No. 08/281 for an analysis of the
monetary transmission mechanism in Singapore.
8

Housing loan NPLs are currently about ½ of 1 percent of total loan and the ratio of monthly mortgage
payments to monthly income (an indicator of affordability) is less than 25 percent.

16
private properties have undergone a major price correction in 2008−09 with no systemic
ripple effects.
31.
Fiscal policy. Like the stimulus of last year, the withdrawal of fiscal support has been
timely and well calibrated. The bulk of the fiscal impulse has been taken away, notably with
the rolling back of the Jobs Credit Scheme and the expiration of other extraordinary
interventions in the 2009 budget. The fiscal stance is now about neutral and in tune with
internal balance. With output close to trend, the 2010 budget rightly focuses on measures to
strengthen potential growth.
B. Policies in the Financial Sector
32.
Context. There was agreement that Singapore’s financial sector is strong. Domestic
banks are funded primarily through retail deposits. Their loan-to-deposit ratio is below
90 percent, regulatory capital is about 17 percent of risk-weighted assets (the Tier 1 ratio is
14 percent), and the liquid asset ratio is about 18 percent. All these indicators imply ample
cushions over statutory requirements. At about 2 percent of total loans, NPLs at local banks
are only marginally up. Foreign banks (which account for over half of banking assets) are
subject to strict licensing procedures and the MAS has an ongoing dialog with both head
offices and home-country supervisors of the larger institutions. Insurers have seen investment
income and new business premiums recover. They continue to have strong capital and
liquidity buffers as well as a conservative asset mix. Hedge funds, wealth management,
private banking, corporate fund advisory, and REITs are another important segment of
Singapore’s financial system. Under redemption pressures, assets under management dropped
to about S$860 billion at end-2008 from over S$1 trillion a year earlier. A recovery has been
underway since, and the fund management industry is expected to keep expanding although
not as fast as pre-crisis.
33.
Banks. The latest round of stress tests based on severe assumptions about
international and domestic shocks suggests that, even in worst-case scenarios, NPL ratios at
local banks would remain below historical highs and capital adequacy would not be impaired.
Direct exposures to banks in fiscally-stressed European countries are small.9
34.
Insurance. The MAS has strengthened the insurers’ stress testing framework by
introducing stress-to-failure scenarios. It has also been reviewing Singapore’s policy owner’s
protection scheme with a view to broadening coverage and providing for pre-funding.
9

For example, the MAS estimates that the exposure of Singapore-incorporated banks to the troubled European
economies amounts to less than 1 percent of their assets. Assuming the same rate of withdrawal as during the
global financial crisis, any decline in Europe-sourced deposits is not expected to exceed 5 percent of total
deposits as of Mar 2010.

17
35.
OTC-traded derivatives. The Singapore Exchange has proposed to set up a facility to
provide for central counterparty clearing of certain financial derivative contracts traded overthe-counter (interest rate swaps and Asian foreign exchange forward contracts settled in
U.S. dollars).
36.
Asset management. The MAS has proposed a licensing regime for fund management
companies (including hedge funds) that manage assets in excess of S$250 million. Capital
requirements and fit-and-proper tests for managers and staff would also apply. These changes
are unlikely to shake up the industry. In the MAS’ view, there are no clear signs yet that
stricter regulations in Europe and the United States are creating incentives for hedge funds to
relocate to Singapore or other jurisdictions in Asia.
37.
Deposit insurance. As part of its regular review, the MAS has proposed
enhancements to the deposit insurance scheme including raising the deposit insurance
coverage limit. Ninety percent of depositors would be insured once the ceiling of deposit
protection is more than doubled, as proposed by the MAS. Staff noted that, in this
connection, consideration could be given to the adoption of risk-based premia.
38.
Corporate governance. Finally, in March, the MAS proposed several enhancements
to current guidelines on corporate governance. These enhancements (relating for example, to
the composition of the Board and structures for risk management) would apply to banks
incorporated in Singapore and certain finance and insurance companies.
C. Post-Crisis Issues
39.
Context. Among the many global issues brought to the fore by the financial crisis,
four are particularly relevant from Singapore’s perspective: Basel III, self-insurance through
official reserves, the design of social safety nets, and strategies to increase productivity. The
first issue speaks to Singapore as a financial hub; the second resonates with Singapore’s
persistent current account surpluses; and the last two are related to the ESC’s goals to make
economic growth more inclusive and improve medium-term prospects.
40.
Basel III. There was broad agreement that the impact of tighter prudential
requirements on capital, liquidity, and leverage is not expected to be too onerous for
Singaporean banks, which are already well capitalized, have stable funding sources, and
whose risky assets are well reserved. Raising the quality of capital may be the greatest
challenge, but it should be manageable. The situation is less clear for foreign banks and
nonbanks. The impact of other reforms under discussion (e.g., levies, surcharges on
systemically important financial institutions, counter-cyclical capital buffers) remains more
speculative, given lack of specificity so far on the design of the reform package. A final
assessment will have to wait for greater clarity about the calibrations, which will determine if
foreign banks will expand or contract activities in Singapore. Much will also depend on
developing closer cooperation among supervisors in different jurisdictions. The MAS
emphasized that—as an international consensus is forged to make the global financial system

18
safer—some discretion in implementation should in any case be left to national authorities
who can best assess local conditions.
41.
Official reserve buffers. In the authorities’ view, Singapore’s accumulation of foreign
assets reflects transitional dynamics. They note that a combination of factors specific to
Singapore—very small size, lack of natural resources, financial center status, large presence
of multinationals, and population aging—calls for high savings (including by corporates) and
a large desired stock of net foreign assets (NFAs) as a buffer against volatility and as a
diversified store of wealth. Indeed, strong external and fiscal positions have been key to
shielding Singapore’s financial sector from the turbulence that has crippled other economies
with large banking systems—a point recognized in a recent IMF Board paper. This said, the
underlying stock adjustment is bound to come to an end in the foreseeable future. The first
baby boomers will begin to retire two years from now and public spending is likely to
increase over the medium term and beyond. Both developments—the authorities argued—
will mark a shift in saving behavior and a move toward stabilizing the NFA ratio.
42.
Social safety nets. Fund recommendations in previous Article IV consultations to
strengthen Singapore’s social safety nets have not found much traction. Discussions this time
provided a clearer context. According to the authorities, Singapore has an extensive system of
social programs that protects the least advantaged without undermining self-reliance.
Through ―invisible but real‖ social safety nets, government assistance builds on personal and
local community support, fostering both family cohesion and social harmony.10 They also
note that, unlike those in many advanced economies, Singapore’s social security system does
not create a burden for future generations—and its effectiveness may be poorly captured by
OECD-type indicators that mask intergenerational inequities or the role of policies to
promote alternative saving vehicles, in particular home ownership.11 This said, the authorities
acknowledge that there remains the challenge of adapting existing programs to fast-changing
economic and social circumstances—and sharpen the means to give lower-income
Singaporeans the skills they need for a better future. Taking note of this position, staff still
argued that generational accounting calculations suggest very large transfers from the current
to future generations and that there is scope for further developing mechanisms to make
housing wealth more liquid or increase the return on pension contributions.
43.
Productivity growth. The staff and the authorities shared the view that faster
productivity gains hold the key to keeping Singapore on the cusp of economic success
(Box 3). In fact, the ESC has set the goal of doubling labor productivity growth to about
10

For example, Singaporeans can approach the Community Development Councils—which have access to
government funds—to help address their financial and medical needs.
11

Indicators such as pension wealth, coverage, or replacement rates as calculated in the OECD Pensions at a
Glance: Asia/Pacific Edition 2009 would suggest that Singapore’s system of social protection is less generous
than in comparable OECD members.

19

Box 3. Productivity Trends in Singapore
Over time, Singapore’s economy has branched out into high value-added sectors
(pharmaceuticals, biomedical, and aeronautical engineering) and financial services.
Despite these developments, real GDP growth slowed significantly in the last decade compared
to the 1980s and 1990s.
A decomposition of growth into the contributions of labor, capital, and total factor
productivity (TFP) casts some light on the
underlying reasons. The contribution of TFP
has declined steadily from over 20 percent in
the 1980s to around 14 percent in the 2000s
(implying an average growth rate of
approximately ¾ of 1 percent in the last
decade). The contribution of capital has also
fallen, from about two-thirds of GDP growth
in the 1980s to just under one-half in
the 2000s. At the same time, labor has become
a more important input in production: its
contribution tripled to nearly 35 percent of GDP growth in the 2000s.
The TFP slowdown is a concern. If the contributions from capital and TFP continue to decline
in the years ahead, Singapore’s ability to sustain steady gains in labor productivity and wages
could be at risk. Indeed, trend growth in labor

2½ percent per year over the next ten years. The measures in the budget to encourage capital
deepening, upgrade worker skills, and enhance innovation are significant steps toward
expanding Singapore’s technology frontier, although they will take time to pay dividend.12
The authorities noted that, in addition to lifting wages of Singaporeans at the low end of the
distribution, the planned gradual increase in foreign worker levies would also contribute to
boost labor productivity by strengthening other supply-side incentives to re-optimize the
capital-labor mix.
D. Exchange Rate Assessment
44.
Developments. For most of 2009, the Singapore dollar in real effective terms (REER)
has moved side-ways. However, it has strengthened somewhat following the resumption in
April of a targeted trend appreciation of the NEER. The current account was about 18 percent
of GDP in 2009, only marginally lower than a year earlier. Over the medium term, it is
projected to decrease modestly at an (approximately) unchanged REER (see paragraph 26).
45.
Assessment. The authorities and the staff agreed that the Singapore dollar REER will
strengthen over the medium term as the domestic economy continues to expand and ongoing
shifts in the pattern of production and global demand play out. This said, staff estimates that
the real effective value of the Singapore dollar is somewhat weaker than its equilibrium
(Box 4). This assessment is subject to considerable uncertainty surrounding, among other
things, the projected current account surplus five years from now—a critical ingredient in the
methodologies used. The staff noted that from a multilateral perspective, a shift of the policy
mix to a tighter monetary policy and a more expansionary fiscal policy would reduce the
current account surplus while safeguarding internal balance. With such a shift, the REER
undervaluation could be eliminated over the medium term without prejudice to domestic
stability. The authorities were once again skeptical about this assessment. In their view,
CGER-like methodologies do not do justice to key features of the Singaporean economy (see
paragraph 41), and are opaque as to the policy implications. According to the MAS’ valuation
models, the real effective Singapore dollar is broadly in line with its fair value. There was
agreement that Singapore’s exchange rate regime continues to serve the country well.

12

Initiatives include tax deductions and technical assistance to increase business efficiency, programs to
improve SME’s access to finance and nurture start ups, as well as educational and training support for
Singaporeans.

approach estimates a current account
―norm‖ of about 11 percent of GDP. Estimates of the norm are derived from a panel of
55 advanced and emerging economies. According to the macroeconomic balance approach, the
Singapore dollar is undervalued by about 8 percent (after adjusting for multilateral consistency).



The external sustainability approach also points to an undervaluation but the extent depends on
the level of net foreign assets (NFA) assumed as a benchmark. Under the assumption that the net
foreign asset position (NFA) is stabilized at its 2009 level (estimated at about 142 percent of
GDP), the implied undervaluation is about 16 percent. This assumed level of NFA is much lower
than that at the time of the 2009 Article IV report (175 percent of GDP), reflecting imputed capital
losses during the global financial crisis, and is known to be an underestimate. Computing, instead,
Singapore’s NFA position with cumulative current account balances gives an NFA estimate of
around 200 percent of GDP—and an undervaluation of the Singapore dollar in real effective
terms of around 7 percent.



The equilibrium exchange rate approach suggests that the exchange rate is broadly in line
with medium-term fundamentals. According to this approach, the exchange rate is about
1 percent below its equilibrium.

22
VI. STAFF APPRAISAL
46.
Crisis impact. Thanks to Singapore’s strong fundamentals and policy frameworks, the
global downturn of 2008 took a smaller toll on the domestic economy than initially feared.
The authorities should be commended for a decisive and timely countercyclical support that
dulled the impact of collapsing trade and market sentiment.
47.
Macroeconomic setting. Buoyed by improved external and domestic demand,
Singapore’s economy is now on a broad-based recovery path. Output losses have been
recouped and policies have shifted their focus from crisis relief to sustaining the expansion.
In view of lingering fragilities in the world economy, flexibility in policymaking remains a
priority. As shown during the global recession, Singapore has a strong track record of
proactive and forward-looking economic policymaking.
48.
Monetary policy. The Monetary Authority of Singapore’s (MAS) latest recalibration
of policy settings has unwound earlier monetary stimulus and restored broadly neutral
monetary conditions. In light of projected output and price dynamics, this is appropriate. An
appreciation bias for the Singapore dollar in effective terms is consistent with internal and
external stability. Barring a significant change in the outlook for growth or inflation,
monetary policy should stay the course.
49.
Capital inflows. Managing disruptive capital flows is not an immediate challenge for
the MAS. Nonetheless, unsettled global financial markets and the expectation of changes in
key regional currencies points to heightened volatility in international capital movements into
and out of Singapore, going forward. Under the MAS policy framework, this volatility could
undermine the stability of goods and asset markets and will need to be addressed, as the MAS
has done all along, through carefully calibrated exchange rate policies and macroprudential
tools.
50.
Fiscal policy. The exit from crisis-related support has largely been completed and
fiscal policy has regained its traditional medium-term orientation. The fiscal settings are now
close to neutral and in tune with internal balance. Multilateral considerations suggest the
desirability of a secular shift of the policy mix toward a more expansionary fiscal stance.
From this perspective too, the authorities’ intention to increase spending in physical and
social infrastructure over the medium term is welcome.
51.
Financial sector policies. Singapore’s financial sector emerged largely unscathed
from the global financial crisis, thanks to strong supervision and risk management systems.
Plans (in coordination with other regional jurisdictions) to unwind by year-end the blanket
deposit guarantee and move to a system with higher deposit coverage are commendable, as
they ensure international consistency among economies with strong financial linkages. As
part of these changes, consideration could be given to making deposit insurance premia riskbased to ensure risk management discipline in financial institutions.

23
52.
Property market boom. The exuberance in some segments of the property market
does not seem to be of systemic importance. Sales of public land and macroprudential
measures so far have been part of a contingent, preemptive, and graduated strategy to curb
excesses. The authorities should continue to monitor the situation closely and build on the
measures already taken, if necessary.
53.
Basel III. Revamped regulations on capital, liquidity, and leverage should not be too
onerous for local banks, which are already well capitalized and whose risky assets are well
reserved. Focus on sound supervision will continue to serve Singapore well. Since the
financial crisis, the MAS has undertaken several public consultations on new rules to enhance
regulatory standards. Proposals aiming at strengthening investor protection and increasing the
responsibility of senior management at financial institutions indicate that the MAS does not
shy away from a prescriptive approach to regulations where needed.
54.
Official reserve accumulation. Building strong reserve buffers has been a central
plank in Singapore’s economic strategy, given its small economic size, lack of natural
resources, demographics, and status as a financial center. While this is an understandable
social choice, the authorities are encouraged to keep it under review, lest a generationally
inequitable outcome or an inefficient allocation of resources results.
55.
Social safety nets. Singapore’s societal preferences are also reflected in its approach
to social insurance whereby ―real but invisible‖ social safety nets mitigate hardship without
undermining work incentives. As the system is adapted to a changing economic and social
landscape, consideration could be given to more orthodox enhancements such as ways to
raise the return to pensioners and facilitate the monetization of housing wealth.
56.
Exchange rate. The REER is somewhat weaker than its medium-term equilibrium.
This assessment—which is subject to considerable uncertainty—suggests a likely
strengthening of the currency over time. Singapore’s exchange rate regime continues to serve
the economy well and the MAS’ exchange-rate-centered monetary framework has been an
important source of stability in times of economic turbulence.
57.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation discussions take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

Singapore’s exchange rate is classified as ―other managed.‖ The Monetary Authority of
Singapore (MAS) monitors its value against an undisclosed basket of currencies and intervenes
in the market to maintain this value within an undisclosed target band. The U.S. dollar is the
intervention currency.
Singapore has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 and maintains an
exchange rate system that is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for
current international transactions.
Singapore maintains restrictions on Singapore-dollar credit facilities to, and bond and equity
issuance by, nonresident financial institutions. Singapore-dollar proceeds obtained by
nonresident financial entities (such as banks, merchant banks, finance companies, and hedge
funds) from loans exceeding S$5 million, or any amount for equity listings or bond issuance
to finance activities outside Singapore have to be swapped or converted into foreign currency
upon draw-down. Financial institutions are prohibited from extending Singapore-dollar credit

3
facilities in excess of S$5 million to nonresident financial entities if there is reason to believe
that the Singapore-dollar proceeds may be used for Singapore-dollar currency speculation.
VIII. Article IV Consultation:
Singapore is on the 12-month consultation cycle. The 2009 Article IV consultation discussions
were held during May 11−18, 2009, the Executive Board discussed the staff report (IMF
Country Report No. 09/269) and concluded the consultation on July 29, 2009.
IX.

FSAP Participation and ROSCs:

The FSAP was undertaken in conjunction with the 2003 Article IV consultation. The FSSA was
published as IMF Country Report No. 04/104.
A fiscal ROSC remains a priority for the authorities, and the exact timing is likely to be
considered in 2011. A data ROSC could also be considered at that time.

ANNEX II: SINGAPORE—STATISTICAL ISSUES
As of June 17, 2010
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance. While the authorities have continued to improve
the quality of data, dissemination of more disaggregated data would enhance the basis for macroeconomic
policy analysis, particularly in the external and fiscal areas.

National accounts: The Singapore Department of Statistics (DOS) has made improvements in data sources
and methodology. The reconciliation of various national accounts estimates was conducted in 2006, resulting in
lower statistical discrepancies. (DOS) has completed the rebasing of the Singapore’s national accounts to
reference year 2005.
Price statistics: DOS has completed the rebasing of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to base year 2009. The
CPI is rebased once every five years to reflect the latest consumption pattern and composition of goods and
services consumed by resident households.

Government finance statistics: Information on government assets held abroad is neither published nor
provided to the Fund. Interest and dividend on these assets and debt service payments on domestic debt made
from the extra budgetary Government Securities Fund are published on an annual basis. Data on the financial
position of the consolidated public sector are not published.

Monetary statistics: The Monetary Authority of Singapore has not submitted the standardized report forms
(SRFs) for monetary statistics introduced in October 2004. The SRFs provide for accounting data to be broken
down by instrument, sector, and currency.

Balance of payments: Data on the international investment position (IIP) are not provided on a disaggregated
level as suggested by the Balance of Payments Manual (5th edition). Also, the IIP position does not include all
the net foreign assets held by Singapore’s Government Investment Corporation, although the associated flows
are included in the balance of payments data. The authorities are improving over time the reporting of the
international investment position to the IMF.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Singapore provides data on a timely basis and meets
all the SDDS specifications. These include the
coverage, periodicity, and timeliness of the data; and
the dissemination of advance release calendars;
quarterly certification of the metadata posted on the
Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board; and
provision of information to allow users to assess data
quality.

No data ROSC is available.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on Singapore
July 16, 2010
The information below has become available following the issuance of the staff report. It
does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
1.

Recent Data



The economy continued to expand strongly in the second quarter. On advance
estimates released on July 14, GDP growth jumped to 26 percent and 19.3 percent,
following (revised) growth of 45.9 percent (q/q s.a.a.r.) and 16.9 percent (y/y), in the
previous three months. The pace of activity in the second quarter was the fastest on
record. Double digit growth was recorded in all main sectors. Manufacturing
benefitted from a spike in the production of pharmaceuticals and electronics; and
services were boosted by tourism and increased financial intermediation. With oneoff factors at play, growth is expected to revert to a more sustainable rate in the
quarters ahead.



On the basis of better˗than-expected performance in the first half of year, the Ministry
of Trade and Industry has marked up its projection for 2010 GDP growth to the range
13−15 percent, from 7−9 percent.

2.
Outlook. The latest data release makes the staff’s projection (which was more upbeat
than consensus) somewhat conservative. The flash second-quarter outturn, if confirmed, and
the revised first-quarter outturn mechanically lift the GDP numbers for 2010. Accordingly,
GDP growth for the year is likely to be revised from about 10 percent to around 15 percent in
the upcoming WEO round. 2011 GDP growth will probably be marked down somewhat, on
base effects. The strong performance increases upside risks to inflation.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
July 23, 2010

International Monetary Fund

Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation with
Singapore
On July 16, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Singapore.1
Background
Singapore’s 2008−09 recession turned out less deep than feared. A broad-based
expansion is now on. Output losses have been recouped and medium˗term issues are
again at the top of the policy agenda.
Activity started to shrink in the second quarter of 2008. At its low mark a year later, GDP
was 9 percent lower than pre˗crisis. The output recovery has been as swift as the
contraction. Growth has been double-digit for three of the last four quarters, reaching
nearly 39 percent (quarter-on-quarter, seasonally adjusted annualized rate) in the first
quarter of this year. Price dynamics have mirrored those of output. Headline inflation
declined quickly and turned negative in the second half of 2009. With dissipating base
effects, rising fuel and transport costs, and growth above potential, the consumer price
index is back to its previous peak.
Although tested, Singapore’s financial system withstood the world recession well. As
global market volatility subsided, financial activities staged a rapid recovery beginning in

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings
up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
early 2009. Banking and insurance led the way, while brokerage and wealth
management were slower in posting gains.
From a historical perspective, Singapore’s exit from recession has been more vigorous
than those following the 2001 dotcom crash and the 1997−98 Asian crisis. Improved
global demand and sentiment as well as strong domestic policies and resilient labor
markets have limited the severity of the downturn and set the stage for the expansion
underway.
Macroeconomic management started to transition out of crisis˗relief mode late last year.
Policy normalization has by now been achieved. Monetary, fiscal, and macroprudential
policies are appropriately calibrated to sustain the expansion and curb risks in the goods
and asset markets. Medium-term issues are again at the top of the policy agenda.
The economy is projected to expand nearly 10 percent in 2010.2 Both external and
domestic demand should continue to support growth, although the exceptional
momentum of the first quarter is bound to wane. As the output gap turns positive,
inflation will be trending up, in part because of one˗off factors.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for the strong fundamentals and policy
frameworks developed over time and the forceful countercyclical policies in response to
the global downturn. A broad-based recovery is now underway and the focus has rightly
shifted to sustaining the expansion. Given Singapore’s high exposure to risks from a
slowdown of world trade or from financial linkages, flexible and proactive policies
continue to be important.
Directors commended the Monetary Authority of Singapore for a skillful unwinding of the
monetary stimulus and the restoration of broadly neutral monetary conditions. The
return to a modest and gradual appreciation of the Singapore dollar in nominal effective
terms is consistent with internal and external stability. Directors pointed out that changes
in the outlook for growth or inflation warrant vigilance and could call for a further
recalibration of monetary policy in the period ahead.
Directors agreed that Singapore’s exchange rate regime remains appropriate and that
the exchange-rate centered monetary framework has been an important source of
stability in challenging times. They noted the staff’s assessment that the Singapore
dollar appears to be somewhat weaker than its medium-term equilibrium level, although
considerable uncertainty clouds this assessment. They also noted that the Singapore
dollar would likely strengthen in real effective terms over time as reforms promote faster
productivity growth and the domestic economy continues to expand.

2

This projection predates the release of the advance estimate for GDP growth for the
second quarter of 2010.

3
Directors considered that last year’s extraordinary fiscal support has been appropriately
withdrawn in the 2010 budget and that fiscal settings are now close to neutral and in
tune with internal balance. They supported the return of fiscal policy to its traditional
medium-term orientation and the emphasis on measures to facilitate innovation, capital
deepening, and productivity growth. The authorities’ intention to increase spending on
physical and social infrastructure is welcome.
Directors agreed that Singapore’s strong supervision and risk management systems had
been crucial in safeguarding financial stability in the global downturn. They endorsed the
plans to unwind by year-end the blanket deposit guarantee and move to a system with
higher deposit coverage. The authorities’ approach will ensure international consistency
among economies with strong linkages. Directors welcomed recent measures to contain
risks in exuberant segments of the property market and encouraged continued close
monitoring of the situation.
Directors acknowledged the authorities’ rationale for promoting self-reliance over social
welfare programs, reflecting society’s preferences. At the same time, they encouraged
the authorities to adapt their approach over time as needed to preserve social and
intergenerational fairness. Directors also noted that because of the special features of
Singapore’s economy, building strong foreign exchange and fiscal reserve buffers has
been a central element of economic strategy which has served the country well. They
considered that, over time, a slower pace of reserve accumulation could be expected
given Singapore’s demographic profile going forward.

Introduction

1.1
The Singapore authorities would like to thank the IMF staff for the 2010 Article IV
Consultation. The discussions during the Consultation, which centred on policies to sustain
non-inflationary growth and mitigate risks, were engaging and constructive.
2

Recent Economic Developments and Outlook

2.1
After experiencing output loss of 9% over the course of the recession, economic
activity in Singapore staged a rapid and decisive recovery. Over four quarters to March 2010,
GDP increased, on average, at a double-digit pace (quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted
annualised rate, q-o-q SAAR), confounding initial expectations of a modest recovery. The
sharp upturn resulted in GDP contracting by a milder-than-expected 1.3% in 2009. With
GDP having expanded by a further 38.6% q-o-q SAAR in Q1 2010, the economy has now
recouped all the output lost during the downturn.
2.2
Since Q2 2009, as the external environment improved and global trade flows
normalised, Singapore’s economic upturn has evolved from one that was driven by inventory
restocking and stabilisation of global financial conditions, to a broad-based recovery that
reflected the pick-up in final demand in our key export markets. In particular, growth was led
by Singapore’s trade-related sectors, especially the IT industry. Besides manufacturing
output, Singapore also experienced a surge in transport and wholesale trade activities,
reflecting its role as a regional trading and logistics hub. At the same time, the financial
services sector and tourism industry picked up strongly, amidst the continued resilience in
regional demand and improved global financial conditions. Recent indicators in April and
May suggest that the growth momentum for trade, industrial production and tourism flows is
likely to be sustained in Q2 2010.
2.3
For the rest of 2010, we expect the growth momentum to slow although domestic
economic activity will remain at a high level. GDP growth will be supported by the recovery
in consumption and investment in some major economies as well as in Asia. Moreover, the
Singapore economy will benefit from the launch of new capacity in the manufacturing and
services sectors. These include new petrochemicals plants, biologics facilities and the
integrated resorts. Notwithstanding the generally sanguine outlook, the authorities are
cognizant of the downside risks presented by the uncertainties in the external environment. A
key risk is the sovereign debt crisis in the Eurozone, which continues to evolve and bears
close monitoring. The Singapore economy will likely moderate to a more sustainable pace of
growth next year against the evolving developments in the global economy.
2.4
Domestic CPI inflation was negative in the second half of 2009, reflecting the
combined effects of lower global oil prices and domestic business costs as well as weaker
domestic consumer demand. However, inflation has since picked up to 0.9% y-o-y in
Q1 2010 and risen further to 3.2% in April-May. Apart from the effects of the low base last
year, the step-up in inflation rate was largely attributed to the rebound in crude oil prices and

2
the cost of private transportation. Recently, costs of other items such as food and recreation
services had also picked up.
2.5
The headline CPI inflation is likely to remain elevated for the rest of the year, driven
largely by higher private road transport costs and commodity prices. Other domestic sources
of inflationary pressure could also emerge more strongly in the coming quarters as business
costs rise in line with the expansion of the economy and tightening of the factor markets. In
particular, labour market conditions have tightened significantly, with the seasonally adjusted
resident unemployment rate nearly back to its pre-crisis level. Thus, industries which are
unable to step up productivity could face difficulty in absorbing the higher wage costs, which
could in turn put upward pressure on the prices of a wide range of goods and services.
Reflecting in part the low base effects, CPI inflation for 2010 is projected to average between
2.5% and 3.5%, before moderating next year.

Macro Policy Responses

3.1
When Singapore entered the recession in 2008, monetary policy, followed by fiscal
policy, shifted to provide support to the domestic economy. As economic activity recovered
swiftly in 2009, most of the countercyclical measures were withdrawn, and monetary and
fiscal policy settings were recalibrated to that which is conducive to sustainable growth and
medium-term price stability. In April 2010, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)
tightened monetary policy by re-centring the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective
exchange rate) policy band upwards and restoring its modest and gradual appreciation path.
There is considerable flexibility embedded in the ―band‖ and ―crawl‖ features of Singapore’s
exchange rate-centred monetary policy framework that would accommodate a sudden shift in
economic conditions. The authorities are alert to developments in the external economic
environment and domestic prices, including those in the property market. The authorities
have a range of tools at their disposal and have in fact deployed some measures to
preemptively curb excesses and promote stable and sustainable conditions in the property
market.
3.2
At the same time, fiscal policy has contributed in a significant way to the required
adjustments in the overall macroeconomic stance. With the recovery in economic conditions,
the government announced exit strategies late last year for two key components of last year’s
Resilience Package – the Jobs Credit Scheme and the Special Risk-Sharing Initiative (SRI).
The gradual phase-out of these extraordinary measures allows the economy sufficient leadtime to transit into the longer term stance of FY2010 Budget. In the FY2010 Budget, the
focus shifted from crisis relief measures to restructuring the economy through investments in
skills, building capabilities and encouraging innovation. The government’s measures
followed from the recommendations of the Economic Strategies Committee (ESC), aimed
especially at shifting the economy towards productivity-driven growth. Further, in line with
the aim of achieving inclusive and broad-based growth, the Budget contained measures to
spur the upgrading of the workforce, higher levies for unskilled foreign labour, additional
transfers for low-wage workers to improve income security, as well as the introduction of a
progressive property tax system.

3
3.3
Singapore’s financial system proved to be resilient during the global crisis. The
banking system and insurance sector remained profitable, liquid and well-capitalised. The
authorities remain vigilant of developments in Europe as well as potential implications from
the uneven pace of global recovery and still abundant liquidity conditions. MAS continues to
focus financial institutions’ attention on managing risks and safeguarding the robustness of
their liquidity, earnings and capital. MAS also contributes to ongoing regulatory reform
discussions at various international fora. Domestically, it has proposed rules to strengthen the
corporate governance of financial institutions, and to improve safety net arrangements such
as the deposit insurance fund and the policy-owners protection fund.

Structural Issues

Accumulation of Foreign Assets
4.1 Singapore’s accumulation of foreign assets reflects the dynamics of demographic
transition and a combination of factors specific to Singapore – very small size, absence of
natural resources, and its status as an open financial centre. Given Singapore’s small size,
investments by Singapore-based enterprises also take place externally. This is complicated by
the limited degree of financial integration within Singapore’s natural hinterland, thus
requiring domestic savings to finance investment abroad. These factors, together with the
need for a buffer against volatility in an economy heavily exposed to capital flows, have led
to a significant stock of official reserves.
Social Safety Nets
4.2 The authorities are raising government spending so as to invest in the country’s
capabilities, while addressing the higher social expenditure needs of an ageing society and
one facing growing income gaps. The authorities are meeting these needs in a way that
preserves the principle of fiscal responsibility and in keeping with a new framework for
equitable sharing of the returns from the country’s reserves between current and future
generations of Singaporeans. In this regard, the Constitution was amended in 2008 to allow
the authorities to draw on more investment returns for public sector spending. The authorities
are spending more on healthcare and social safety nets including the Workfare Income
Supplement scheme and various social assistance or community support programmes, while
continuing to incentivise personal and family responsibility. In addition, the returns paid by
the Central Provident Fund Board (CPFB) to its members compare well with equivalent
market-based instruments, as exemplified by the experience in the recent crisis.1

1

From 1 Jan 2008, CPF interest rates were restructured to provide a return equal to 10-year Singapore
Government Securities (SGS) plus 1% for savings in the Special, Medisave, and Retirement Accounts, this
being an approximation of returns on equivalent long-term bond instruments. Further, an additional 1% return
above this long-term bond rate is provided for the first S$60,000 of a member’s combined balances. Throughout
the financial crisis, CPFB also continued to pay a minimum of 2.5% p.a. for savings in the Ordinary Account,
and a minimum of 4.0% for savings in the Special, Medisave, and Retirement Accounts.

Final Remarks

5.1
Given its openness, the Singapore economy was hard hit during the severe global
downturn. Conversely, with the pick-up in the global economy, the Singapore economy
rebounded swiftly, supported by policy measures put in place during the downturn. As a
consequence, the authorities have exited from the short-term accommodative policy settings
and focused on policies to sustain growth over the medium term. Nonetheless, the authorities
are mindful of the risks in the global economy. The authorities will closely monitor
developments in the external environment and will respond as appropriate.
5.2
The Singapore authorities are pleased to inform the Board that they are agreeable to
the publication of the Staff Report associated with the 2010 Article IV Consultation and will
be releasing the Buff Statement at the same time.
